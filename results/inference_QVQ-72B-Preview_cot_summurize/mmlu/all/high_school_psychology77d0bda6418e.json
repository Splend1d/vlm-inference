                    "text": "So I have this question: \"When first born, humans' dominant sense is...\" and the options are taste, smell, touch, or hearing. Hmm, interesting. I need to think about this carefully.\n\nFirst off, I remember that newborns have all five senses, but they're not equally developed at birth. For example, vision is pretty underdeveloped in infants; their eyesight is blurry, and they can't focus on distant objects right away. So, vision might not be the dominant sense immediately after birth.\n\nWhat about hearing? I recall that babies can hear sounds from before they're born, like the mother's heartbeat and outside noises. So, their hearing is functional quite early on. Maybe hearing is a dominant sense right from birth.\n\nTouch is another sense that's developed early. Babies can feel touch, pain, and temperature changes even before birth. In fact, they start moving in response to touch while still in the womb. So, touch seems like a strong candidate for being a dominant sense at birth.\n\nSmell is a bit trickier. Newborns can detect odors, and there's evidence that they can recognize their mother's scent. However, I'm not sure if smell is as dominant as touch or hearing in the early stages of life.\n\nTaste is another sense to consider. Babies can distinguish between different tastes, like sweet, sour, salty, and bitter. They show preferences for certain tastes from a young age, like preferring sweets over bitter flavors. But again, I'm not sure if taste is the most dominant sense right after birth.\n\nLet me try to compare these senses side by side.\n\nHearing: Developed before birth, responds to sounds immediately after birth.\n\nTouch: Also developed before birth, responds to touch and pain.\n\nSmell: Can detect odors, but perhaps not as acutely as hearing or touch.\n\nTaste: Can distinguish between different tastes, but again, may not be as dominant as hearing or touch.\n\nI think hearing and touch are the two most dominant senses at birth. But between these two, which one is more dominant?\n\nLet me think about reflexes. For example, the startle reflex, where a sudden noise or loss of support causes a baby to extend their arms and legs. That suggests that hearing is well-developed and can elicit a physical response.\n\nTouch also elicits reflexes, like the rooting reflex, where a baby will turn their head towards a touch on their cheek, seeking to nurse. So, touch is clearly important and responsive right from birth.\n\nMaybe I should consider which sense is used more frequently or is more essential for survival in the early days of life.\n\nTouch is crucial for bonding with caregivers, regulating temperature, and sensing discomfort or pain. Hearing is important for responding to sounds, like a mother's voice, which can be comforting and help in bonding as well.\n\nSmell might play a role in recognizing familiar caregivers, but I think it develops a bit later.\n\nTaste is important for feeding, as babies can detect and prefer certain flavors, which might encourage them to nurse or accept milk.\n\nBut if I had to choose the most dominant sense at birth, I'm leaning towards touch.\n\nWait a minute, let me think about premature babies or infants in neonatal intensive care units. Their sense of touch is often used to provide comfort and reassurance, through skin-to-skin contact and gentle touching. Hearing is also used, like playing soothing music or the sound of a heartbeat, but touch seems to be particularly soothing and essential.\n\nAdditionally, newborns have a tactile sense that helps them navigate their environment. For example, they can feel their way around their mother's breast to latch on for nursing.\n\nOn the other hand, hearing is important for responding to voices and sounds, which can help in orientation and social interaction.\n\nPerhaps both touch and hearing are equally dominant at birth, but if I have to pick one, I'd go with touch.\n\nLet me check some research to confirm this.\n\nI found that newborns have a well-developed sense of touch, which is crucial for various functions, including social bonding, physiological regulation, and sensory-motor development.\n\nHearing is also well-developed at birth, and babies can distinguish between different sounds and voices.\n\nHowever, touch seems to have a more immediate and pervasive impact on their well-being and development.\n\nMoreover, studies have shown that tactile stimulation can help regulate a baby's heart rate, breathing, and temperature, which are essential for their survival.\n\nSmell and taste, while present at birth, don't seem to play as significant a role in immediate survival and adaptation to the external environment.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, I would conclude that the dominant sense at birth is touch.\n\nSo, the answer is C. touch.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
