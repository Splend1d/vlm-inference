                    "text": "So I have this problem here: In the group G = {2, 4, 6, 8} under multiplication modulo 10, I need to find the identity element. The options are A. 6, B. 8, C. 4, D. 2.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an identity element is in a group. An identity element for a group operation is the element that, when combined with any other element in the group, leaves that element unchanged. So, in this case, for multiplication modulo 10, the identity element should be the one that, when multiplied modulo 10 by any other element in the group, results in that element itself.\n\nSo, I need to find an element e in G such that for every element a in G, e * a \u2261 a mod 10.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: 6\n\nLet's check if 6 is the identity element.\n\nCompute 6 * 2 mod 10: 12 mod 10 = 2. That's correct because it should equal 2.\n\n6 * 4 mod 10: 24 mod 10 = 4. Correct.\n\n6 * 6 mod 10: 36 mod 10 = 6. Correct.\n\n6 * 8 mod 10: 48 mod 10 = 8. Correct.\n\nSo, 6 seems to work for all elements in G. But let's check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption B: 8\n\n8 * 2 mod 10: 16 mod 10 = 6, which is not equal to 2. So, 8 is not the identity.\n\nOption C: 4\n\n4 * 2 mod 10: 8 mod 10 = 8, which is not equal to 2. So, 4 is not the identity.\n\nOption D: 2\n\n2 * 2 mod 10: 4 mod 10 = 4, which is not equal to 2. So, 2 is not the identity.\n\nTherefore, the only element that satisfies the condition for all elements in G is 6.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure there are no mistakes.\n\nFirst, recall that in modular arithmetic, multiplying two numbers and then taking the modulus is the same as taking the modulus of each number first and then multiplying.\n\nSo, for example, 6 * 8 mod 10: 48 mod 10 is indeed 8, which matches the original element 8.\n\nSimilarly, 6 * 6 mod 10: 36 mod 10 is 6, which matches 6.\n\n6 * 4 mod 10: 24 mod 10 is 4, which matches 4.\n\nAnd 6 * 2 mod 10: 12 mod 10 is 2, which matches 2.\n\nAll these checks confirm that 6 acts as the identity element in this group.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there could be another element that also acts as an identity. For example, does 1 behave as an identity? But 1 is not in the group G = {2, 4, 6, 8}, so it's irrelevant here.\n\nMoreover, in group theory, the identity element is unique, so once we've found that 6 works, we can be confident it's the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if 6 is indeed in the group and that the operation is well-defined.\n\nG = {2, 4, 6, 8}, and 6 is a member of G. The operation is multiplication modulo 10, which is a well-defined operation on G.\n\nAlso, I should confirm that G is indeed a group under this operation. For that, I need to verify the group axioms:\n\n1. Closure: For all a, b in G, a * b mod 10 is also in G.\n\nLet's check all possible products:\n\n2 * 2 = 4 mod 10 = 4 \u2208 G\n\n2 * 4 = 8 mod 10 = 8 \u2208 G\n\n2 * 6 = 12 mod 10 = 2 \u2208 G\n\n2 * 8 = 16 mod 10 = 6 \u2208 G\n\n4 * 4 = 16 mod 10 = 6 \u2208 G\n\n4 * 6 = 24 mod 10 = 4 \u2208 G\n\n4 * 8 = 32 mod 10 = 2 \u2208 G\n\n6 * 6 = 36 mod 10 = 6 \u2208 G\n\n6 * 8 = 48 mod 10 = 8 \u2208 G\n\n8 * 8 = 64 mod 10 = 4 \u2208 G\n\nAll products are in G, so closure holds.\n\n2. Associativity: Multiplication modulo 10 is associative, so (a * b) * c = a * (b * c) for all a, b, c in G.\n\n3. Identity element: We've already determined that 6 is the identity.\n\n4. Inverse elements: For each a in G, there exists an element b in G such that a * b \u2261 6 mod 10.\n\nLet's check inverses:\n\nFor 2: 2 * b \u2261 6 mod 10 \u21d2 b \u2261 6 * 2\u207b\u00b9 mod 10. Since 2 * 3 = 6 mod 10, but 3 is not in G. Wait, but G is {2,4,6,8}, and 3 is not in G. So, does 2 have an inverse in G?\n\nWait a minute, 2 * 8 = 16 mod 10 = 6, so b = 8.\n\nSimilarly, 4 * 4 = 16 mod 10 = 6.\n\n6 * 6 = 36 mod 10 = 6.\n\n8 * 2 = 16 mod 10 = 6.\n\nSo, every element has an inverse in G:\n\n2 \u2194 8\n\n4 \u2194 4\n\n6 \u2194 6\n\n8 \u2194 2\n\nTherefore, all group axioms are satisfied, confirming that G is indeed a group under multiplication modulo 10, and 6 is the identity element.\n\nThus, the correct answer is A. 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 6} \\]"
