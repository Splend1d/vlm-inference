                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. In Scenario 1, someone hid their recreational substances in their teenager's closet. In Scenario 2, someone was caught watching porn in the church. Both seem like potentially tricky situations morally, but I have to decide which one is \"clearly morally wrong.\"\n\nLet me start by looking at Scenario 1. Hiding recreational substances in a teenager's closet. Okay, so a few things come to mind here. First off, what do we mean by \"recreational substances\"? If we're talking about illegal drugs, that's one thing, and if it's legal substances like alcohol or tobacco, that's another. The scenario doesn't specify, so I'll have to consider both possibilities.\n\nBut wait, the question specifies \"recreational substances,\" which could be interpreted as drugs, whether illegal or legal. However, given that it's hidden in a teenager's closet, it's likely that these substances are not meant for the teenager, but perhaps the parent is hiding them there for some reason.\n\nNow, hiding drugs in a teenager's closet could be problematic for several reasons. First, if the teenager finds them, they might be tempted to use them, which could be dangerous, especially if they're illegal or not meant for them. Second, if the teenager is aware that these substances are being hidden in their closet, it might put them in a difficult position, maybe even compromising their integrity or trustworthiness.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the parent is trying to keep these substances away from the teenager, thinking that hiding them in the teenager's closet is a safe place. But even then, it's still risky because it could be discovered by the teenager or someone else, leading to potential harm.\n\nSo, in this scenario, it seems like there's a clear moral issue here: putting a teenager at risk by hiding potentially dangerous substances in their personal space without their knowledge or consent.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: being caught watching porn in the church. This is quite a different scenario. Here, someone is engaging in an activity that is generally considered private and not appropriate for public settings, especially not in a church.\n\nWatching porn is typically seen as a private activity, and doing it in a public place like a church is highly inappropriate. Churches are places of worship and respect, and such behavior could be offensive to many people, including churchgoers and the clergy.\n\nMoreover, being caught doing this could cause distress or embarrassment to others who might witness it, and it disrespects the sanctity of the place.\n\nSo, in this scenario, it's clear that watching porn in a church is morally wrong because it's a public act in an inappropriate setting that could harm others' feelings and the sacred nature of the location.\n\nNow, comparing the two scenarios, both seem to involve actions that could be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, hiding recreational substances in a teenager's closet could be seen as wrong because it puts the teenager at risk and compromises their safety and trust.\n\nIn Scenario 2, watching porn in a church is wrong because it's a disrespectful act in a sacred place and could offend or harm others who are present.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to the options provided:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it again.\n\nIn Scenario 1, hiding recreational substances in a teenager's closet is indeed a morally questionable act, as it involves potential harm to the teenager and a breach of trust.\n\nIn Scenario 2, watching porn in a church is also morally wrong due to the public nature of the act and the disrespect it shows to the place and potentially to others.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios depict actions that are considered morally wrong.\n\nI don't see any reason to choose any other option, so I'm confident that the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
