                    "text": "Let's tackle this fluid dynamics problem. We have a horizontal pipe with a fluid flowing through it, and the viscosity is negligible. That means we can apply Bernoulli's equation without worrying about energy losses due to friction. The flow is streamlined and the flow rate is constant, which is good because Bernoulli's equation works best under these conditions.\n\nFirst, let's understand the setup. We have two points, Point 1 and Point 2, in the pipe. The diameter at Point 1 is d, and the flow speed there is V. At Point 2, the diameter is d/3, which is smaller than at Point 1. Since the pipe is horizontal and the fluid is incompressible (density \u03c1 is constant), the pressure differences will be related to the changes in cross-sectional area and flow speed.\n\nBernoulli's equation for two points in steady flow is:\n\nP1 + 1/2 \u03c1 V1\u00b2 + \u03c1 g h1 = P2 + 1/2 \u03c1 V2\u00b2 + \u03c1 g h2\n\nSince the pipe is horizontal, h1 = h2, so the \u03c1 g h terms cancel out. That simplifies Bernoulli's equation to:\n\nP1 + 1/2 \u03c1 V1\u00b2 = P2 + 1/2 \u03c1 V2\u00b2\n\nWe can rearrange this to find the difference in pressure:\n\nP2 - P1 = 1/2 \u03c1 (V1\u00b2 - V2\u00b2)\n\nBut the question asks for how P2 compares to P1, and gives options in terms of \u03c1 V\u00b2. So, I need to find an expression that relates P2 and P1 in terms of \u03c1 and V.\n\nFirst, I need to find V2 in terms of V1. Since the flow rate is constant, and the fluid is incompressible, the volume flow rate Q is the same at both points. The volume flow rate is given by:\n\nQ = A V\n\nWhere A is the cross-sectional area of the pipe, and V is the flow velocity.\n\nThe area of a circle is \u03c0 r\u00b2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter is d, the radius is d/2. So, at Point 1:\n\nA1 = \u03c0 (d/2)\u00b2 = \u03c0 d\u00b2 / 4\n\nAt Point 2, the diameter is d/3, so:\n\nA2 = \u03c0 (d/3)\u00b2 = \u03c0 d\u00b2 / 9\n\nSince Q is constant:\n\nA1 V1 = A2 V2\n\nPlugging in the areas:\n\n\u03c0 d\u00b2 / 4 * V = \u03c0 d\u00b2 / 9 * V2\n\nWe can solve for V2:\n\nV2 = (A1 / A2) * V = (9 / 4) * V = 2.25 V\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's double-check that calculation.\n\nStarting again:\n\nA1 V1 = A2 V2\n\nSo,\n\n\u03c0 d\u00b2 / 4 * V = \u03c0 d\u00b2 / 9 * V2\n\nSimplify:\n\nd\u00b2 / 4 * V = d\u00b2 / 9 * V2\n\nDivide both sides by d\u00b2:\n\n1/4 * V = 1/9 * V2\n\nThen, V2 = (9/4) * V = 2.25 V\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But intuitively, when the diameter decreases, the speed should increase, right? Wait, d/3 is smaller than d, so if the diameter at Point 2 is smaller, the cross-sectional area is smaller, so the speed should be higher there. Yes, V2 > V1, which makes sense.\n\nNow, plug V2 back into Bernoulli's equation:\n\nP2 - P1 = 1/2 \u03c1 (V1\u00b2 - V2\u00b2) = 1/2 \u03c1 (V\u00b2 - (2.25 V)\u00b2) = 1/2 \u03c1 (V\u00b2 - 5.0625 V\u00b2) = 1/2 \u03c1 (-4.0625 V\u00b2) = -2.03125 \u03c1 V\u00b2\n\nSo, P2 is less than P1 by 2.03125 \u03c1 V\u00b2. But none of the options have exactly this value. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating V2.\n\nWait, let's recalculate V2.\n\nGiven A1 V1 = A2 V2,\n\nA1 = \u03c0 (d/2)\u00b2 = \u03c0 d\u00b2 / 4\n\nA2 = \u03c0 (d/3)\u00b2 = \u03c0 d\u00b2 / 9\n\nSo,\n\n\u03c0 d\u00b2 / 4 * V = \u03c0 d\u00b2 / 9 * V2\n\nCancel \u03c0 d\u00b2:\n\n1/4 * V = 1/9 * V2\n\nThen, V2 = (9/4) * V = 2.25 V\n\nThat seems correct. But the pressure difference calculation gave -2.03125 \u03c1 V\u00b2, which isn't matching any option directly.\n\nMaybe I need to express V2 in terms of V more accurately.\n\nLet me write V2 as (d1/d2)^2 * V1.\n\nGiven d2 = d1/3, then V2 = (d1/(d1/3))^2 * V1 = (3)^2 * V1 = 9 V1\n\nWait, that's different from what I had before.\n\nAh, I see my mistake. When calculating V2, I used A1 V1 = A2 V2, and A2 = (d/3)^2, but I squared the diameter ratio incorrectly earlier.\n\nLet's correct that.\n\nGiven A \u221d r\u00b2 \u221d d\u00b2, then A2 = (d/3)^2 = d\u00b2/9\n\nBut A1 = d\u00b2/4, so V2 = (A1 / A2) * V1 = (d\u00b2/4) / (d\u00b2/9) * V1 = (9/4) * V1 = 2.25 V1\n\nWait, but according to the relation V2 = (d1/d2)^2 * V1, it should be V2 = (d / (d/3))^2 * V = (3)^2 * V = 9 V\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nI think I'm confusing the direct proportionality.\n\nIn fluid flow, the velocity is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area for constant flow rate.\n\nSo, V \u221d 1/A\n\nGiven A \u221d d\u00b2, then V \u221d 1/d\u00b2\n\nTherefore, V2/V1 = (d1/d2)^2\n\nSo, V2 = V1 * (d1/d2)^2 = V * (d / (d/3))^2 = V * (3)^2 = 9 V\n\nAh, so V2 = 9 V\n\nI must have messed up the area ratio earlier.\n\nSo, correcting that, V2 = 9 V\n\nNow, plug back into Bernoulli's equation:\n\nP2 - P1 = 1/2 \u03c1 (V1\u00b2 - V2\u00b2) = 1/2 \u03c1 (V\u00b2 - (9 V)^2) = 1/2 \u03c1 (V\u00b2 - 81 V\u00b2) = 1/2 \u03c1 (-80 V\u00b2) = -40 \u03c1 V\u00b2\n\nSo, P2 = P1 - 40 \u03c1 V\u00b2\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. less than the pressure at Point 1 by 4 \u03c1v^2\n\nB. less than the pressure at Point 1 by 40 \u03c1v^2\n\nC. more than the pressure at Point 1 by 4 \u03c1v^2\n\nD. more than the pressure at Point 1 by 40 \u03c1v^2\n\nSo, option B seems to be the correct one.\n\nJust to make sure, let's confirm the units.\n\nPressure difference: -40 \u03c1 V\u00b2\n\nUnits: \u03c1 is kg/m\u00b3, V is m/s, so kg/m\u00b3 * (m/s)\u00b2 = kg/(m\u00b7s\u00b2) = N/m\u00b2 = Pa\n\nYes, that's the unit for pressure.\n\nTherefore, the pressure at Point 2 is less than the pressure at Point 1 by 40 \u03c1 V\u00b2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{B}\\]"
