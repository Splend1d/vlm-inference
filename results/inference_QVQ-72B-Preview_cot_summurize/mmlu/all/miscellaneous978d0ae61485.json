Saab, and D. IKEA. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that Sweden is known for a few big companies, and some of them are quite famous worldwide. Let me think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with A. Gambro. I think Gambro is a medical equipment company, right? They deal with things like dialysis machines and stuff like that. That's not furniture, so probably not the correct answer.\n\nNext is B. Electrolux. I've heard of Electrolux; they make appliances like refrigerators, ovens, and washing machines. So, they're more into home appliances rather than furniture. Doesn't seem to fit the description.\n\nThen there's C. Saab. Saab is a car manufacturer, isn't it? They used to make cars, and I think they might also be involved in aerospace or something. Definitely not a furniture company.\n\nLastly, there's D. IKEA. Now, IKEA is a name that comes to mind immediately when I think of Swedish companies that specialize in furniture. They're famous for their ready-to-assemble furniture, and they're known for being affordable. I think this is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. IKEA was founded in Sweden, and it's one of the largest furniture retailers in the world. They're famous for their modern design and pocket-friendly prices. So, yeah, that seems to match the description perfectly.\n\nI don't think it's any of the other companies because Gambro is medical equipment, Electrolux is appliances, and Saab is automobiles. None of those are furniture companies.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The answer should be D. IKEA.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. IKEA}} \\]"
