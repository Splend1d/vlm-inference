                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"How many positive 4-digit integers have only odd digits?\" And the options are A. 100, B. 999, C. 625, D. 500.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. We're looking for 4-digit numbers where every digit is odd. So, what are the odd digits? Well, they are 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. So, these are the only digits we can use in our 4-digit number.\n\nNow, a 4-digit number can't start with 0, right? But in this case, since we're only dealing with odd digits, 0 isn't an issue because 0 isn't odd. So, all positions can be any of the five odd digits.\n\nSo, for each of the four digits in the number, I have 5 choices: 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. And since each digit is independent of the others, I can multiply the number of choices for each position together to get the total number of possible numbers.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of choices for the first digit: 5\n\nNumber of choices for the second digit: 5\n\nNumber of choices for the third digit: 5\n\nNumber of choices for the fourth digit: 5\n\nSo, total number of 4-digit numbers = 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 = 5^4 = 625\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should think about it differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each digit is independent and has the same set of possible choices. So, since there are 5 possible odd digits for each of the 4 positions, the total number should indeed be 5^4, which is 625.\n\nLet me consider if there are any restrictions I'm missing. The problem says \"positive 4-digit integers,\" so it has to be between 1000 and 9999, inclusive. And all digits must be odd. So, no, there are no other restrictions.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can list out all possible combinations for a smaller number of digits to see if my logic holds.\n\nLet's say we have 2-digit numbers with only odd digits. Following the same logic, there would be 5 choices for the first digit and 5 choices for the second digit, so 5 \u00d7 5 = 25 possible numbers.\n\nLet's list them out to confirm:\n\n11, 13, 15, 17, 19\n\n31, 33, 35, 37, 39\n\n51, 53, 55, 57, 59\n\n71, 73, 75, 77, 79\n\n91, 93, 95, 97, 99\n\nYes, that's 25 numbers, which matches the calculation.\n\nSimilarly, for 3-digit numbers, it would be 5^3 = 125.\n\nAnd for 4-digit numbers, 5^4 = 625.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer should be 625.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 100\n\nB. 999\n\nC. 625\n\nD. 500\n\nIt seems that C. 625 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let's see if there's any other way to interpret the problem that might lead to a different answer.\n\nIs there any possibility that leading zeros are considered, but in this case, since we're dealing with odd digits only and the first digit can't be zero anyway, that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps considering that some digits can't be repeated or something like that, but no, the problem doesn't specify that digits must be unique. So, repetitions are allowed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe thinking in terms of permutations or combinations, but since order matters and repetitions are allowed, it's correctly modeled as 5^4.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The straightforward approach seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 625.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{625} \\]"
