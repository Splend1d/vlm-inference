S.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these elements is a metalloid. I remember that metalloids are elements that have properties of both metals and nonmetals, and they kind of sit between the two on the periodic table. So, let's think about each option.\n\nFirst, Cr is Chromium. I think it's a metal. It's used in things like stainless steel, and it's shiny and conducts electricity, which are typical properties of metals. So, probably not a metalloid.\n\nNext, Mn is Manganese. Another metal. It's also used in alloys like steel and is known for its magnetic properties. Again, seems like a metal, not a metalloid.\n\nThen there's Si, which is Silicon. Now, this one rings a bell. I think Silicon is a metalloid. It's used in semiconductors, which are materials that can behave like both conductors and insulators depending on conditions. That sounds like it has properties of both metals and nonmetals, which is the definition of a metalloid.\n\nLastly, S is Sulfur. I know Sulfur is a nonmetal. It's dull, brittle, and a poor conductor of electricity. Definitely not a metalloid.\n\nSo, based on this, Si (Silicon) seems to be the correct answer. Just to make sure, let me recall the periodic table. The metalloids are typically found in a diagonal band separating the metals and nonmetals. They include elements like Boron (B), Silicon (Si), Germanium (Ge), Arsenic (As), Antimony (Sb), and Tellurium (Te). So, yes, Si is definitely a metalloid.\n\nI think the answer is C. Si.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
