                    "text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Dean Co. issuing bonds at a premium and then incorrectly using the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method to amortize that premium. The bonds were issued on July 1 of year 7 and are due on July 1 of year 12. The question is asking about the effects of this error on the bond carrying amount and retained earnings at June 30 of year 12. The options are:\n\nA. Overstated Understated\n\nB. Understated Overstated\n\nC. Overstated No effect\n\nD. No effect No effect\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what it means to issue bonds at a premium and how the amortization methods differ.\n\nSo, when a company issues bonds at a premium, it means they sold the bonds for more than their face value. The difference between the issue price and the face value is the premium, which needs to be amortized over the life of the bond. This amortization reduces the interest expense each period.\n\nNow, there are two main methods to amortize a bond premium: the straight-line method and the effective interest method.\n\nThe straight-line method amortizes the premium evenly over the life of the bond. So, each period, you amortize the same amount of premium, which reduces the interest expense by that same amount each time.\n\nOn the other hand, the effective interest method amortizes the premium based on the remaining carrying amount of the bond and the effective interest rate. This means that the amortization amount changes each period because it's based on the carrying amount, which decreases as the premium is amortized.\n\nGiven that, I need to think about how using the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method would affect the bond carrying amount and retained earnings.\n\nLet me recall that the carrying amount of the bond is essentially the face value plus any unamortized premium or minus any unamortized discount. So, if we're amortizing the premium incorrectly, that will affect the carrying amount.\n\nAlso, retained earnings are affected through net income. If interest expense is misstated due to incorrect amortization, that will affect net income and thus retained earnings.\n\nSo, let's consider the differences between the two methods.\n\nIn the effective interest method, the amortization amount increases over time because the carrying amount decreases, and the effective interest rate is applied to that decreasing balance. Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.\n\nActually, with a premium, the amortization amount under the effective interest method decreases over time. Because the premium amortization is calculated as the difference between the interest paid (which is based on the face amount times the stated rate) and the interest expense (which is based on the carrying amount times the effective rate).\n\nSince the carrying amount decreases as premium is amortized, the interest expense decreases over time, and thus the amortization amount decreases over time.\n\nIn contrast, the straight-line method amortizes a constant amount each period.\n\nSo, in the early years, the straight-line amortization amount might be higher or lower than the effective interest method's amortization amount, depending on how the two methods compare.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nSuppose the bond has a face value of $100 and was issued at $105, with a premium of $5. Let's say the stated interest rate is 5% and the market rate is 4% at the time of issuance.\n\nUnder the effective interest method:\n\n- Year 1:\n\n- Interest expense = $105 * 4% = $4.20\n\n- Interest paid = $100 * 5% = $5.00\n\n- Amortization of premium = $5.00 - $4.20 = $0.80\n\n- Carrying amount = $105 - $0.80 = $104.20\n\n- Year 2:\n\n- Interest expense = $104.20 * 4% = $4.17\n\n- Interest paid = $5.00\n\n- Amortization of premium = $5.00 - $4.17 = $0.83\n\n- Carrying amount = $104.20 - $0.83 = $103.37\n\nAnd so on, with the amortization amount increasing slightly each year.\n\nUnder the straight-line method:\n\n- Annual amortization = $5 / 5 years = $1.00 per year\n\n- Interest expense = $5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00 per year\n\n- Carrying amount decreases by $1.00 each year: $105, $104, $103, etc.\n\nFrom this, in the early years, the straight-line method has higher amortization and lower interest expense compared to the effective interest method.\n\nIn the later years, the effective interest method has higher amortization as the carrying amount decreases.\n\nBut in this problem, we're looking at June 30 of year 12, which is six months before the maturity date of July 1 of year 12.\n\nWait, the bonds were issued on July 1 of year 7 and due on July 1 of year 12, so the term is 5 years.\n\nThe error occurred by using straight-line instead of effective interest method for amortizing the premium.\n\nI need to assess the impact on the bond carrying amount and retained earnings as of June 30 of year 12.\n\nFirst, let's consider the bond carrying amount.\n\nUnder straight-line, the amortization is constant each period.\n\nUnder effective interest, the amortization starts lower and increases over time.\n\nSo, by June 30 of year 12, which is very close to the maturity date of July 1 of year 12, the carrying amount should be close to the face value, but with some premium still unamortized under straight-line compared to effective interest.\n\nWait, no. If the bonds mature on July 1 of year 12, and it's June 30 of year 12, that's just one month before maturity.\n\nBut the payments are likely annual, on July 1 each year, with the final payment including the face value.\n\nAssuming interest is paid annually on July 1.\n\nSo, from year 7 to year 12, with payments on July 1 each year, and the error is throughout the life of the bond.\n\nNow, to find out the impact on the carrying amount as of June 30 of year 12, I need to see what the carrying amount should have been under effective interest and compare it to what it would be under straight-line.\n\nSimilarly, for retained earnings, I need to see the cumulative effect on net income over the life of the bond due to the incorrect amortization method.\n\nLet me try to calculate or at least reason through it.\n\nFirst, under straight-line, the annual amortization of the premium is constant.\n\nUnder effective interest, the amortization starts lower and increases over time.\n\nSo, in the early years, straight-line amortization is higher than effective interest amortization.\n\nTherefore, in the early years, interest expense is lower under straight-line compared to effective interest.\n\nThis would mean that net income is higher in the early years under straight-line than it would be under effective interest.\n\nConversely, in the later years, effective interest amortization is higher than straight-line amortization, so interest expense would be higher under effective interest in those years.\n\nTherefore, net income would be lower under effective interest in the later years compared to straight-line.\n\nNow, since the bonds mature on July 1 of year 12, and it's June 30 of year 12, just one month before maturity, most of the premium should have been amortized by now.\n\nBut because straight-line amortization is higher in the early years and lower in the later years compared to effective interest, the carrying amount under straight-line would be higher than under effective interest as of June 30 of year 12.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf straight-line amortizes more premium in the early years and less in the later years compared to effective interest, then by June 30 of year 12, less premium would have been amortized under straight-line compared to effective interest.\n\nTherefore, the carrying amount under straight-line would be lower than under effective interest because more premium remains unamortized.\n\nWait, no. If straight-line amortizes more in early years and less in later years, then by the end, the total amortization should be the same under both methods, since they both amortize the entire premium over the life of the bond.\n\nBut the timing differs.\n\nSo, at any point in time, the carrying amount under straight-line might be different from that under effective interest.\n\nGiven that, and considering that straight-line amortizes more in early years and less in later years compared to effective interest, the carrying amount under straight-line would be lower than under effective interest towards the end of the bond's life.\n\nBecause under straight-line, less premium is being amortized in the later years, meaning more premium remains unamortized, reducing the carrying amount.\n\nWait, no. If less premium is being amortized under straight-line in the later years, that means more premium remains, which would increase the carrying amount, not decrease it.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try a numerical example.\n\nSuppose the bond has a face value of $100, issued at $105, with a premium of $5, and a 5-year term.\n\nInterest rate is such that the market rate is lower than the coupon rate, hence the premium.\n\nLet's assume the coupon rate is 5% and the market rate is 4%.\n\nInterest payments are annual, on July 1 each year.\n\nSo, year 1: interest paid = $5, interest expense = $105 * 0.04 = $4.20, amortization = $0.80, carrying amount = $105 - $0.80 = $104.20\n\nYear 2: interest paid = $5, interest expense = $104.20 * 0.04 = $4.17, amortization = $0.83, carrying amount = $104.20 - $0.83 = $103.37\n\nAnd so on, with amortization increasing slightly each year.\n\nUnder straight-line, annual amortization = $5 / 5 years = $1.00 per year\n\nYear 1: interest paid = $5, interest expense = $4.00, amortization = $1.00, carrying amount = $105 - $1.00 = $104.00\n\nYear 2: interest paid = $5, interest expense = $4.00, amortization = $1.00, carrying amount = $104.00 - $1.00 = $103.00\n\nAnd so on, down to $100 on July 1 of year 5.\n\nNow, on June 30 of year 12, which is just before the final payment on July 1 of year 12, the carrying amount should be close to the face value.\n\nBut since the bonds mature on July 1 of year 12, and it's June 30, one month before, the carrying amount would still have some premium unamortized.\n\nUnder effective interest, the premium amortization increases over time, so by June 30 of year 12, most of the premium would have been amortized.\n\nUnder straight-line, the amortization is constant, so by June 30 of year 12, the total amortization would be $1.00 per year for 5 years, totaling $5.00, meaning no premium remains.\n\nWait, but the bonds mature on July 1 of year 12, so by June 30, the last amortization would have been on July 1 of year 11.\n\nSo, under straight-line, with annual amortization of $1.00, by July 1 of year 11, the carrying amount would be $100, and no premium remains.\n\nBut under effective interest, the amortization is front-loaded, with higher amortization in the early years and lower in the later years.\n\nWait, no. With a premium, amortization under effective interest increases over time.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nYear 1: amortization = $0.80\n\nYear 2: amortization = $0.83\n\nYear 3: amortization = $0.86\n\nYear 4: amortization = $0.89\n\nYear 5: amortization = $0.92\n\nTotal amortization: $0.80 + $0.83 + $0.86 + $0.89 + $0.92 = $4.20, plus the final payment of the face value.\n\nWait, but the total premium is $5, so under effective interest, the total amortization over 5 years should be $5.\n\nSimilarly, under straight-line, it's $5 over 5 years.\n\nSo, by June 30 of year 12, just before the final payment on July 1, the carrying amount under both methods should be equal to the face value, assuming no accrued interest.\n\nBut the question is about June 30 of year 12, which is one month before the final payment.\n\nSo, under both methods, the carrying amount should be $100 on July 1 of year 12.\n\nBut because of the timing difference, on June 30 of year 12, the carrying amount might differ slightly.\n\nHowever, given that it's very close to the maturity date, the difference might be negligible.\n\nBut the question seems to suggest that there is an effect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the timing.\n\nLet me consider that the error affects the entire period, and by June 30 of year 12, the carrying amount under straight-line would have less premium amortized compared to effective interest.\n\nWait, no. Under straight-line, the amortization is constant each year, so by the end of year 5, all $5 of premium is amortized.\n\nUnder effective interest, the amortization is higher in the later years compared to straight-line.\n\nWait, no. Under effective interest, the amortization increases over time, so in the later years, it's higher than under straight-line.\n\nTherefore, under straight-line, the total amortization by June 30 of year 12 would be $5, since the last amortization was on July 1 of year 11.\n\nUnder effective interest, the amortization would be slightly more than $5 by June 30 of year 12, because in the final year, the amortization would be higher than under straight-line.\n\nWait, no. The total amortization over the life of the bond under both methods should be $5.\n\nUnder straight-line, it's $1.00 per year for 5 years = $5.\n\nUnder effective interest, the total amortization is also $5, but the timing differs.\n\nHowever, by June 30 of year 12, which is just before the final payment on July 1 of year 12, the carrying amount under both methods should be $100, assuming no accrued interest.\n\nTherefore, there should be no difference in the carrying amount at that point.\n\nBut the question suggests that there is an effect on the carrying amount.\n\nPerhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the error affects the interest expense over the life of the bond, which in turn affects net income and retained earnings.\n\nLet me focus on the interest expense.\n\nUnder straight-line, the interest expense each year is $4.00 (since interest paid is $5.00 and amortization is $1.00, so expense is $4.00).\n\nUnder effective interest, the interest expense decreases over time:\n\nYear 1: $4.20\n\nYear 2: $4.17\n\nYear 3: $4.13\n\nYear 4: $4.09\n\nYear 5: $4.05\n\nTotal interest expense over 5 years under effective interest: $4.20 + $4.17 + $4.13 + $4.09 + $4.05 = $20.64\n\nUnder straight-line: $4.00 per year for 5 years = $20.00\n\nSo, the interest expense is higher under effective interest compared to straight-line.\n\nTherefore, net income over the life of the bond is lower under effective interest by the difference in interest expense, which is $20.64 - $20.00 = $0.64.\n\nTherefore, retained earnings would be lower under effective interest by $0.64.\n\nSince Dean Co. used straight-line instead of effective interest, retained earnings are overstated by $0.64.\n\nNow, for the bond carrying amount, since by June 30 of year 12, just before the final payment, the carrying amount should be $100 under both methods, there should be no difference.\n\nBut the question suggests that the carrying amount is affected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is an accrued interest to consider.\n\nAssuming interest is paid annually on July 1, and it's June 30, one month before the payment, there might be one month of accrued interest.\n\nBut if the bonds mature on July 1, there might not be any accrued interest, as the final interest payment is due on that day.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the error affects the carrying amount due to incorrect amortization.\n\nBut given that by June 30 of year 12, the carrying amount should be $100 under both methods, I think the carrying amount is not affected.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be:\n\nBond carrying amount: no effect\n\nRetained earnings: overstated\n\nWhich corresponds to option D.\n\nBut the question provides options that suggest either both are overstated or understated, or one is overstated and the other is not affected.\n\nGiven that, and based on my calculation, retained earnings are overstated, and carrying amount is not affected, the correct choice is D: no effect on bond carrying amount and no effect on retained earnings.\n\nWait, but in the options, D says \"no effect no effect,\" which seems to suggest no effect on either, but based on my calculation, retained earnings are overstated.\n\nPerhaps I misread the options.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nOption A: Overstated Understated\n\nOption B: Understated Overstated\n\nOption C: Overstated No effect\n\nOption D: No effect No effect\n\nBased on my analysis, carrying amount is not affected, and retained earnings are overstated.\n\nSo, none of the options directly match this.\n\nPerhaps I need to reconsider my analysis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the error affects the carrying amount as well.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIf Dean Co. used straight-line instead of effective interest, which is required by GAAP, then the interest expense is understated each period, leading to overstated net income and retained earnings.\n\nBut at the end of the bond's life, the carrying amount should still be $100, assuming no other errors.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the carrying amount is"
