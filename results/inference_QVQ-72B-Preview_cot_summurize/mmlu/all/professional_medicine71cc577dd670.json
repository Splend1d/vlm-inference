                    "text": "So I'm looking at this case of a 15-year-old girl with acne that's been going on for three months. She started developing breasts and pubic hair at 12, and her first period was at 14. Now, she has comedones on her cheeks and forehead, and her breast and pubic hair development are both at the highest stage, which is Tanner stage 5.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's causing her acne. Acne is usually related to oil production in the skin, right? And oil production is influenced by hormones. So, hormones are probably playing a big role here.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. Increased estrogen stimulation of the sebaceous glands.\n\nHmm, estrogen is typically thought of as a female hormone, and it's involved in developing female characteristics like breasts. But does estrogen directly stimulate sebaceous glands? I thought estrogen might help regulate sebum production, but I don't recall it being the primary driver of increased sebum production in acne.\n\nB. Increased responsiveness of the sebaceous glands to follicle-stimulating hormone.\n\nFollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is mainly involved in reproduction, like egg development in females. I don't remember FSH having a direct effect on sebaceous glands. Maybe it's indirectly related, but I'm not sure about this one.\n\nC. Increased sympathetic stimulation to the sebaceous glands.\n\nThe sympathetic nervous system is part of the autonomic nervous system, involved in fight-or-flight responses. While stress can sometimes affect acne, I don't think sympathetic stimulation directly stimulates sebaceous glands. Maybe indirectly through hormone changes, but again, I'm not sure.\n\nD. Stimulation of the sebaceous glands by androgens.\n\nAndrogens are male hormones, like testosterone, but both males and females have them. Androgens are known to stimulate sebaceous gland activity, which can lead to increased oil production and acne. This seems like a plausible option.\n\nWait a minute, let's think about puberty. Puberty is when hormones start changing, leading to secondary sexual characteristics. In girls, puberty typically starts around age 10 or 11 with breast development and growth of pubic hair, and menarche (first period) usually occurs around age 12 to 14.\n\nIn this case, the girl started developing breasts and pubic hair at 12, and her first period was at 14, which seems within the normal range.\n\nNow, acne is common during puberty because of increased androgen levels. So, even though she's 15 and has already gone through puberty, the hormonal changes might still be affecting her skin.\n\nLet me consider if there's any indication of abnormal hormone levels. Her breast and pubic hair development are at Tanner stage 5, which is fully developed, so that suggests her hormone levels are appropriate for her age.\n\nBut she has acne, which is often related to higher androgen levels stimulating sebaceous glands to produce more oil, leading to clogged pores and acne.\n\nOption D says stimulation of the sebaceous glands by androgens. That sounds right.\n\nOption A mentions estrogen, which is also present in females, but I don't think it directly stimulates sebaceous glands in the same way androgens do.\n\nOption B mentions follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). FSH is involved in ovulation and egg maturation in females. I don't recall it having a direct effect on sebaceous glands. Maybe indirectly through hormone balance, but I don't think it's the primary cause of acne.\n\nOption C is about sympathetic stimulation. While stress can sometimes affect acne, it's not directly related to sebaceous gland stimulation. So, I think this is less likely.\n\nTherefore, the most likely underlying cause of her acne is stimulation of the sebaceous glands by androgens.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Maybe there's something else going on here.\n\nHer menarche was at 14, which is normal. Tanner stage 5 indicates full sexual maturity. So, her development seems to be proceeding normally.\n\nAcne is a common problem in adolescence due to increased androgen levels, which can lead to increased sebum production and acne formation.\n\nSo, unless there's something unusual about her hormone levels, which isn't indicated in the case, the most straightforward answer is that androgens are stimulating her sebaceous glands, leading to acne.\n\nMaybe I should consider if there could be any other factors at play. For example, could there be an endocrine disorder causing excessive androgen production?\n\nWell, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a possibility, which can cause acne due to high androgen levels. But PCOS usually presents with irregular periods, ovarian cysts, and sometimes hirsutism (excessive hair growth). In this case, the patient has regular periods (assuming since she's had menarche and no mention of irregularities) and no mention of hirsutism.\n\nSo, unless there's more information, it's probably safe to assume that her acne is due to normal pubertal androgen levels stimulating her sebaceous glands.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps her androgen levels are within normal range for her age, but her sebaceous glands are particularly sensitive to androgens. That could also lead to acne.\n\nBut again, without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, the most likely cause of her acne is stimulation of the sebaceous glands by androgens.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
