                    "text": "Let's see. Ms. Ling has been living in her home for 4 years, and there are 12 months in each year. She found the total number of months, m, by multiplying 4 and 12, which gives m = 48 months. So, m = 4 \u00d7 12 = 48.\n\nNow, the question is asking for another way to find the total number of months, m, using one of the given options. I need to see which of these number sentences also gives m = 48.\n\nLet's look at option A: 12 \u00f7 m = 4. If I solve this for m, I get m = 12 \u00f7 4 = 3. But wait, we know m should be 48, so this doesn't match.\n\nOption B: m \u00d7 4 = 12. If I solve for m, m = 12 \u00f7 4 = 3. Again, not 48.\n\nOption C: 12 \u2013 m = 4. Solving for m, m = 12 \u2013 4 = 8. Still not 48.\n\nOption D: m \u00f7 4 = 12. Solving for m, m = 12 \u00d7 4 = 48. Ah, this gives m = 48, which matches our original calculation.\n\nSo, option D seems to be correct. But just to be sure, let's think about it differently. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother way to think about the total number of months is to consider the number of months in a year and multiply it by the number of years. So, 12 months/year \u00d7 4 years = 48 months. That's what Ms. Ling did.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the number of months per year and the number of years, I can also think about dividing the total months by the number of years to find the months per year, but that doesn't seem to align with the options.\n\nWait, option D says m \u00f7 4 = 12. If I think about it, m being the total months, divided by 4 years, should give me the number of months per year, which is 12. So, m \u00f7 4 = 12 means m = 48, which matches our original calculation.\n\nOption A, 12 \u00f7 m = 4, would imply that m = 3, which is incorrect.\n\nOption B, m \u00d7 4 = 12, also gives m = 3, which is wrong.\n\nOption C, 12 \u2013 m = 4, gives m = 8, which is not right.\n\nOption D, m \u00f7 4 = 12, gives m = 48, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if there's another way to interpret the problem. Perhaps using ratios or something else.\n\nLet me consider the relationship between years and months. There are 12 months in 1 year. So, if someone lives in a home for 4 years, the total months are 4 times 12, which is 48.\n\nAnother way could be to think about how many months are in 4 years. Again, that's 4 times 12, which is 48.\n\nBut the question is asking for another number sentence that shows the same total. So, among the options, only option D gives m = 48.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using addition: starting from the number of years, multiplying by the months per year, which is what Ms. Ling did.\n\nBut that's essentially the same as what she did, just phrased differently.\n\nI think the key is to find an equation that, when solved for m, gives m = 48, and option D does that directly.\n\nSo, I believe the answer is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
