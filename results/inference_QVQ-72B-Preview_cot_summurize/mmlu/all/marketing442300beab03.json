The description says it involves discussing the problem with informed sources and examining pre-existing data to discover the cause of the problem. The options are situation analysis, information investigation, exploratory research, and bottom-line analysis.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what each of these terms means in the context of research. Starting with situation analysis, I think that's more about assessing the current state of affairs, maybe in a particular industry or organization, to understand the environment and identify opportunities or threats. But that doesn't seem to exactly match the description provided in the question.\n\nNext, information investigation sounds like it involves gathering and examining information to find out facts or details about something. However, it seems a bit too broad and doesn't specifically focus on discovering the cause of a problem by discussing it with informed sources and looking at existing data.\n\nThen there's exploratory research. From what I recall, exploratory research is used in the initial stages of research when not much is known about a topic. It aims to gather insights and understand the underlying reasons and motivations behind certain phenomena. This often involves qualitative methods like interviews, focus groups, and examining existing data. That seems to align pretty closely with the description in the question.\n\nLastly, bottom-line analysis sounds like it's focused on financial or performance metrics, perhaps determining the direct impact or ROI of a particular action or decision. But the question is about discovering the cause of a problem in general, not specifically related to financial or performance issues.\n\nGiven these considerations, exploratory research seems to be the most fitting answer. It's designed for situations where there's limited knowledge about the problem and aims to uncover the causes and gain deeper insights through discussions with informed sources and examination of pre-existing data.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check each option:\n\n- Situation analysis: More about current state assessment, not specifically about discovering causes of problems.\n\n- Information investigation: Involves gathering information but doesn't emphasize the use of informed sources and pre-existing data to discover causes.\n\n- Exploratory research: Specifically mentioned for situations with limited knowledge, uses discussions with informed sources and existing data to understand causes.\n\n- Bottom-line analysis: Focused on financial or performance impacts, not generally on discovering causes of problems.\n\nYes, exploratory research is the best fit here. So, the answer should be C. Exploratory research.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
