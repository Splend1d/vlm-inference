                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a woman who signed up for pre-natal and post-natal exercise classes at a gym. She was three months pregnant when she enrolled in a one-year program that costs $2,000, paid in quarterly installments of $500. She made her first payment and started classes. After three months, she was in a car accident and her doctor told her to stop the exercise classes and rest instead. Now, she's received a billing notice for her second payment and she's telling the gym she won't be coming back and doesn't think she should have to pay anymore. The contract says all fees are non-refundable.\n\nThe question is asking about her duty to pay the second installment of $500. There are four options:\n\nA. It would be excused because of impossibility of performance.\n\nB. It would be excused because the essential purpose of the contract was frustrated.\n\nC. It would not be excused because the contract stipulated that no fees would be refundable.\n\nD. It would not be excused because her covenant to make the installment payment is also enforceable as a condition precedent.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, we have a contract between the woman and the gym. She agreed to pay $2,000 in four payments of $500 each, and the contract is for one year of pre-natal and post-natal exercise classes. The contract also says that all fees are non-refundable.\n\nAfter three months of attending classes, she has an accident and her doctor advises her to stop the exercises and rest instead. So, she can't continue with the classes as planned.\n\nNow, the gym is asking for the second payment, but she's saying she doesn't owe it because she can't attend the classes anymore.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nOption A: Impossibility of performance.\n\nThis doctrine generally refers to situations where, through no fault of their own, a party cannot perform their contractual obligations. In this case, the woman can't attend the classes because of her doctor's advice following the accident. So, she can't receive the services she contracted for.\n\nBut, the gym might argue that they can still provide the service if she decides to come back, or perhaps they have other ways to accommodate her needs.\n\nHowever, her doctor specifically told her to stop the exercises and rest, so it's not just her choice; it's a medical necessity.\n\nSo, this could be a case of impossibility of performance because she can't receive the benefit of the contract as intended.\n\nOption B: Frustration of purpose.\n\nThis occurs when the underlying reason for entering into the contract is destroyed, making the contract's performance meaningless or valueless to the party seeking to avoid it.\n\nHere, the purpose of the contract was for her to receive pre-natal and post-natal exercise services. But due to the accident and her doctor's advice, she can't receive those services as planned. So, the purpose of the contract has been frustrated.\n\nHowever, frustration of purpose is often considered when the contract can still be performed, but the reason for it no longer exists.\n\nIn this case, the gym can still offer her services, but she can't use them as intended.\n\nOption C: The contract stipulated no fees are refundable.\n\nThis means that even if she can't use the services, she still has to pay because the contract says fees are non-refundable.\n\nBut, does that mean she has to pay for services she can't receive? That's a bit tricky.\n\nGenerally, contracts can include terms that are enforceable, including non-refundable fees.\n\nHowever, if the enforcement of such a term would be unconscionable or against public policy, a court might not enforce it.\n\nIn this case, it's not clear if the non-refundability clause would be enforced, especially if her inability to use the services is due to an unforeseen event like an accident and doctor's advice.\n\nOption D: Her covenant to make the installment payment is enforceable as a condition precedent.\n\nThis seems to suggest that paying the installment is a condition she must fulfill before something else happens, perhaps before the gym has to provide services.\n\nBut in this case, the payment is due regardless of whether she uses the services or not, as per the contract.\n\nSo, she has a contractual obligation to pay the installments, regardless of whether she attends the classes.\n\nGiven that, it seems like the gym would argue that she still owes the payment because the contract says so, and the payments are not contingent on her attending the classes.\n\nBut, from a fairness perspective, making her pay for services she can't use might not seem right, especially if the reason she can't use them is beyond her control and is for her health.\n\nNow, considering all this, I need to determine which option most accurately describes her duty to pay the second installment.\n\nLet's see:\n\nOption A suggests that her obligation is excused due to impossibility of performance.\n\nOption B suggests it's excused due to frustration of purpose.\n\nOption C says it's not excused because of the non-refundable fees clause.\n\nOption D says it's not excused because the payment is a condition precedent.\n\nI think the key here is whether the non-refundability clause overrides any doctrines like impossibility or frustration of purpose.\n\nIn contract law, parties can agree to terms that allocate risks, including non-refundability clauses.\n\nHowever, these clauses may not be enforceable in all circumstances, especially if they are unconscionable or against public policy.\n\nIn this scenario, the woman's inability to use the services is due to an unforeseen event (the accident and doctor's advice), which is beyond her control.\n\nIf the contract includes a force majeure clause or something similar, it might excuse her performance.\n\nBut, the problem doesn't mention any such clause.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the contract specifies non-refundable fees, it seems that the gym would argue that she still owes the payment.\n\nHowever, from a legal standpoint, courts might consider whether enforcing the non-refundability clause in these circumstances is fair or if it constitutes a penalty, which is generally not enforceable.\n\nBut, without more information about the contract's specific terms, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nBetween the options given, I think Option C is the most directly applicable because it refers to the contract's stipulation of non-refundable fees.\n\nOptions A and B relate to doctrines that might excuse her performance, but given that the contract has a non-refundability clause, those doctrines might not apply, or at least not override the contract's terms.\n\nOption D seems similar to Option C, suggesting that the payment obligation stands regardless of her ability to use the services.\n\nBut, I think Option C is more precise in referencing the contract's specific term about non-refundability.\n\nTherefore, I would say that Option C most accurately describes her duty to pay the second installment fee: it would not be excused because the contract stipulated that no fees would be refundable.\n\nHowever, I should note that this might not be the end of the story. If she were to challenge the enforcement of the non-refundability clause on grounds of unconscionability or other defenses, a court might rule differently.\n\nBut based on the information provided, and assuming the contract's terms are enforceable as written, Option C seems the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
