                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out how Stark Co. should handle this potential legal liability in their financial statements. They've been sued for something that happened in October, and now, before issuing their December 31 statements, they need to decide how to account for this contingency.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the accounting principles related to contingencies. I know that under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), companies have to account for contingencies like lawsuits. Specifically, there are two main aspects: accruing the liability and disclosing information about the contingency.\n\nThe criteria for accruing a contingency are:\n\n1. It's probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred.\n\n2. The amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\n\nIf both of these conditions are met, then the company should accrue the liability. If not, but there's still some risk, they should disclose the nature of the contingency.\n\nIn this case, Stark's legal counsel believes it's \"reasonably possible\" that there will be an unfavorable outcome, and the damages are estimated to range from $100,000 to $150,000.\n\nWait a minute, what's the difference between \"probable\" and \"reasonably possible\"?\n\nI think \"probable\" means more likely than not, like greater than 50% chance, whereas \"reasonably possible\" is less than probable but still not remote. In other words, it's possible but not the most likely outcome.\n\nSo, since the legal counsel says it's \"reasonably possible\" that there will be an unfavorable outcome, that suggests it's not necessarily probable. If it's not probable, then the first criterion for accruing the liability isn't met.\n\nBut, they still need to consider whether to disclose the contingency.\n\nThe guidance says that if there's at least a reasonable possibility of a loss, and the amount can be reasonably estimated, then they should disclose the possible loss and, if able, the range of possible loss.\n\nIn this scenario, the legal counsel believes there's a reasonably possible unfavorable outcome, and they've provided a range of $100,000 to $150,000 for damages.\n\nSo, since it's not probable, they shouldn't accrue the liability. Instead, they should disclose the contingency, including the range of possible damages.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Accrue $100,000 and disclose $100,000 - $150,000\n\nB. Accrue $100,000 and disclose $150,000\n\nC. Accrue $0 and disclose $100,000 - $150,000\n\nD. Accrue $0 and disclose $150,000\n\nOption C seems to align with what I've concluded. They shouldn't accrue anything because it's not probable, but they should disclose the possible loss range of $100,000 to $150,000.\n\nWait, but option D says accrue $0 and disclose $150,000. Why would they disclose only the upper limit? The legal counsel provided a range, so shouldn't they disclose the entire range?\n\nI think they should disclose the entire range, from $100,000 to $150,000, because that gives users of the financial statements a better understanding of the potential liability.\n\nDisclosing just the highest amount might be misleading because it doesn't reflect the lower end of the possible damages.\n\nTherefore, option C seems correct.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nIf the outcome is reasonably possible, not probable, then no accrual is necessary. But they should disclose the contingency, including the possible range of loss.\n\nSo, accrue $0 and disclose $100,000 - $150,000.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nOption C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
