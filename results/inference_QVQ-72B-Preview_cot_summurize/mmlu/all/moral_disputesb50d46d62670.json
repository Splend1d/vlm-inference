                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which moral theory Carruthers uses when he talks about whether nonhuman animals have moral standing. The options are consequentialism, Kantianism, virtue ethics, and contractualism. I need to pick the one that best fits his approach.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what \"moral standing\" means. I think it's about whether something deserves moral consideration and, if so, how much. So, in this case, it's about whether animals should be considered in our moral decisions and actions.\n\nNow, let's recall what each of these moral theories emphasizes.\n\nStarting with consequentialism, this theory suggests that the morality of an action is based on its outcomes or consequences. So, if an action leads to good consequences, it's moral; if it leads to bad consequences, it's immoral. Utilitarianism is a type of consequentialism that aims for the greatest good for the greatest number.\n\nKantianism, or Kant's deontological ethics, focuses on duties and rules. It suggests that actions are moral if they adhere to certain universalizable maxims or duties, regardless of the consequences. Kant believed that only rational beings have moral standing because they can understand and act upon these duties.\n\nVirtue ethics is another approach that emphasizes character and virtues rather than rules or consequences. It looks at what kind of person one should be, focusing on developing good character traits like honesty, courage, and compassion. In this view, moral actions flow from a virtuous character.\n\nContractualism is a bit different. It involves imagining agreements or social contracts that define what is morally acceptable. The idea is that moral norms arise from what people would agree to under certain conditions, perhaps in an original position of equality, as John Rawls suggested.\n\nGiven these brief explanations, I need to see which of these theories Carruthers aligns with in his discussion about animal moral standing.\n\nI remember reading some of Carruthers' work on animal ethics. He often discusses the capacity for suffering and pleasure in animals and considers how their interests should be taken into account. This sounds a bit like consequentialism, especially utilitarianism, because it focuses on the consequences of actions in terms of pleasure and pain.\n\nBut let me think deeper. Kantianism requires rationality for moral standing, and since animals are not rational in the same way humans are, they might not have full moral standing according to Kant. However, Carruthers does argue that animals have moral standing based on their ability to experience pain and suffering, which doesn't rely solely on rationality.\n\nVirtue ethics would consider whether a virtuous person would take into account the welfare of animals. It might support the idea that a compassionate person would consider animals' interests, but it's not directly about the animals' standing; it's more about the moral character of the person making the decision.\n\nContractualism seems less relevant here because it's about agreements among rational agents, typically humans, and doesn't directly address animals' moral standing unless included in the social contract.\n\nSo, between consequentialism and virtue ethics, consequentialism seems more straightforward. Carruthers emphasizes the importance of considering animals' ability to suffer and experience pleasure, which aligns with utilitarian concerns.\n\nMoreover, I recall that Carruthers discusses the idea that moral consideration should be extended to any being capable of suffering or experiencing pleasure, which is a key tenet of utilitarianism.\n\nTherefore, I would say that Carruthers approaches questions about the moral standing of nonhuman animals from the perspective of consequentialism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
