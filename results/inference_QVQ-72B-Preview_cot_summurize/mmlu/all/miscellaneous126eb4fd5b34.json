King Tut. Okay, I need to figure out which one of these historical figures is buried in the Valley of the Kings.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Valley of the Kings is in Egypt, right? It's famous for being a burial site of ancient Egyptian pharaohs, especially from the New Kingdom period. So, it's associated with mummies and tombs like Tutankhamun's, who is often referred to as King Tut.\n\nSo, let's think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Louis XIV. He was a king of France, right? I think he was buried in France, maybe in Versailles or something like that. But definitely not in Egypt. So, probably not buried in the Valley of the Kings.\n\nOption B: Elvis Presley. He was an American singer and actor. I know he died in Memphis, Tennessee, and I think he's buried there, maybe at Graceland, his famous mansion. Again, not in Egypt.\n\nOption C: Julius Caesar. He was a Roman statesman and general, living in ancient Rome. I don't recall any connection to Egypt other than his involvement with Cleopatra, but that was in Egypt, not buried there, I think. Wait, actually, Cleopatra was the last pharaoh of Egypt, but Julius Caesar was not Egyptian. I think he was buried in Rome.\n\nOption D: King Tut. This seems the most plausible. King Tut was an Egyptian pharaoh, famous for his intact tomb discovered in the Valley of the Kings by Howard Carter in the 1920s. His full name is Tutankhamun, and he reigned during the New Kingdom period.\n\nLet me double-check. Louis XIV was French, Elvis was American, Julius Caesar was Roman, and King Tut was Egyptian. Given that the Valley of the Kings is in Egypt and was used for burying pharaohs, King Tut seems like the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility that any of the others might have been buried there. No, I don't think so. France has its own burial sites for kings, America has its own cemeteries for celebrities, and Rome has places where Roman leaders were buried.\n\nAlso, I remember that the Valley of the Kings is located near Luxor in Egypt, and it's primarily known for the tombs of the New Kingdom pharaohs, which includes King Tut.\n\nSo, I'm confident that King Tut is the correct answer to this question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
