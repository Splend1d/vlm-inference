                    "text": "So I've come across this term called \"feminization of poverty,\" and I need to figure out what it refers to from these four options. Let me read them again to make sure I understand.\n\nOption A says it's \"the critical deconstruction of 'poverty' by feminist theorists.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit abstract. Deconstruction usually means breaking down concepts to understand their underlying assumptions, and feminist theorists might look at how poverty affects different genders. But does that directly refer to the feminization of poverty? Maybe it's part of the discussion, but I'm not sure if that's the primary definition.\n\nOption B mentions \"women's increased chances of being in poverty, due to low pay and greater welfare dependency.\" This seems more concrete. It suggests that women are more likely to be poor because they earn less and might rely more on welfare systems. That makes sense because there are statistics showing that women on average earn less than men, and they might be more dependent on social welfare programs, especially if they're single parents or working in low-paying jobs.\n\nOption C says \"the way in which managing a budget and avoiding poverty tends to be a woman's responsibility within the home.\" This is interesting because it implies that within families, women are often in charge of managing money and making sure the household stays out of poverty. But is this directly related to the feminization of poverty, or is it more about gender roles in budget management?\n\nOption D mentions \"the disproportionate number of female sociologists who do research on poverty.\" This seems more about who studies poverty rather than what feminization of poverty is. It might be a fact, but it doesn't define what the term means.\n\nAlright, let me think this through. The feminization of poverty is a term that describes a trend where an increasing proportion of people living in poverty are women, especially women who are heads of households. So, it's not just about deconstructing the concept of poverty (Option A), although that's important in academic circles.\n\nOption B seems to align closely with this definition. It talks about women having increased chances of being in poverty due to low pay and greater welfare dependency. This suggests that more women are falling into poverty because of these factors, which fits with the idea of the feminization of poverty.\n\nOption C is about women being responsible for managing budgets at home, which might be true in many households, but it doesn't directly explain why more women are living in poverty. It's more about gender roles in financial management within families.\n\nOption D is about the composition of researchers in sociology who study poverty, which is a separate issue from the experience of poverty among women.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I think the correct answer is Option B: women's increased chances of being in poverty, due to low pay and greater welfare dependency. This directly addresses the phenomenon of more women being in poverty and provides reasons for this trend.\n\nJust to double-check, I recall that the feminization of poverty is a well-documented trend, especially in countries like the United States, where single mothers are disproportionately represented among the poor. They often face challenges like lower wages, fewer employment opportunities, and reliance on welfare systems that may not fully meet their needs.\n\nYes, that reinforces my choice. Option B accurately describes this situation. So, I'm confident that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
