From what I understand, horse-race journalism is when media coverage of politics focuses mainly on who's winning or losing, rather than on the policies or substantive issues at play. It's like reporting on a political campaign as if it's a sport, where the emphasis is on the competition between candidates rather than on what they stand for.\n\nSo, let's look at each option:\n\nA. A news story focuses on a politician's scandals rather than achievements.\n\nThis seems more like tabloid journalism or gossip, where the focus is on the personal lives of politicians rather than their political records or policies. While it might be related to horse-race journalism in that it can influence public perception and potentially affect poll standings, it's not directly about the competition between candidates.\n\nB. A television news anchor reports an event before the station's rivals.\n\nThis sounds more like competitive news reporting, where speed is important to beat other news outlets. It's about being first to report something, but it doesn't necessarily focus on the competitive aspect of a political race between candidates. It could be about any event, not specifically about elections or political campaigns.\n\nC. A reporter announces which candidate leads in a public opinion poll.\n\nThis seems very much like horse-race journalism. It's directly focusing on the standings of candidates in a poll, which is essentially reporting on who's ahead or behind in the race for votes. This kind of reporting often emphasizes the lead or margin between candidates, sometimes at the expense of discussing their platforms or policies.\n\nD. A newspaper editor prints stories about long-term political developments.\n\nThis appears to be more substantive reporting, focusing on the broader political landscape and long-term trends rather than on the day-to-day fluctuations of a campaign. It seems to be the opposite of horse-race journalism, as it's not concentrating on the immediate competition between candidates.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C seems to be the best example of horse-race journalism because it directly reports on the relative positions of candidates in a poll, which is a key aspect of covering politics as a competitive race.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
