Violation of the statute is a felony punishable by a fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for up to two years. The state courts have interpreted this statute as a public welfare offense requiring no particular mental state for its violation. As such, this is a strict liability crime whereby culpability is imposed on a defendant for doing the proscribed act. A defendant, a 15-year-old, entered the store to purchase a shotgun as a present for her father. She took a shotgun off the shelf and went to the cashier's counter to pay for it.

                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario. There's a state law that says you can't sell guns or ammo to anyone under 17, and breaking this law is a pretty serious offense, like a felony with fines and jail time. But the interesting part is that the courts say this law is a \"public welfare offense\" and it doesn't require any specific intent or mental state to violate it. That means, basically, if you do the act that's forbidden\u2014selling guns to someone under 17\u2014you can be punished, no matter what your thoughts or intentions were.\n\nNow, in this case, the person being charged is a 15-year-old who wanted to buy a shotgun as a gift for her dad. She went into the store, picked out the gun, went to the cashier's counter, but the cashier wasn't there. So, she left the money on the counter and took the gun. Now, she's being prosecuted for violating this state statute.\n\nThe question is whether she should be found guilty or not, and there are four options:\n\nA. Guilty, because she purchased the shotgun while under the statutory age.\n\nB. Guilty, because the statute imposes absolute criminal liability.\n\nC. Not guilty, provided she was unaware that the statute prohibited the sale of weapons to a person in her age group.\n\nD. Not guilty, provided that the legislative intent was not to make the purchase of shotguns a criminal offense.\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the law prohibits the sale of guns and ammunition to anyone under 17. The key point here is who is doing the selling. The law is aimed at sellers, not buyers. So, the statute is likely intended to hold sellers accountable for not selling firearms to minors.\n\nIn this scenario, the 15-year-old is the buyer, not the seller. So, does the law apply to her?\n\nOption A says she's guilty because she purchased the shotgun while under the statutory age. But wait, the law says nothing about buying; it's about selling. So, maybe the law doesn't directly make it a crime for her to buy the gun, but rather makes it a crime for the seller to sell it to her.\n\nOption B says she's guilty because the statute imposes absolute criminal liability. But again, the statute is about selling, not buying. So, even if the seller is strictly liable for selling to a minor, does that make the buyer criminally liable just for buying?\n\nOption C says she's not guilty if she didn't know about the law. But the law is strict liability, meaning ignorance isn't a defense. So, even if she didn't know, she could still be guilty if the law applies to her.\n\nOption D says she's not guilty if the legislative intent wasn't to criminalize the purchase of shotguns. This seems plausible because the law is about sales, not purchases.\n\nHere's my thinking: The law is specifically about selling guns and ammo to minors. It doesn't say anything about buying. So, the act of buying itself might not be criminalized directly by this statute. The focus is on the seller, not the buyer.\n\nMoreover, since it's a strict liability offense, the seller doesn't need to know the buyer's age or have any intent to break the law. But again, that's for the seller, not the buyer.\n\nSo, if the law doesn't directly make it a crime for a minor to buy a gun, then charging the buyer might be a stretch.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's an implied prohibition against minors buying guns, even if the law is phrased in terms of selling. After all, it wouldn't make sense to prohibit sellers from selling to minors if minors could just walk in and buy guns without consequence.\n\nHowever, based strictly on the wording of the statute provided, it seems that the prohibition is on the seller, not the buyer.\n\nSo, in this case, the 15-year-old is being prosecuted for violating the state statute. But since the statute is about selling, not buying, it's unclear if her actions constitute a violation.\n\nPerhaps there's another law that makes it illegal for a minor to buy firearms, but based on the information given, we don't know that.\n\nTherefore, strictly speaking, she shouldn't be found guilty under this particular statute because the statute is directed at sellers, not buyers.\n\nSo, options A and B seem incorrect because they assume that the statute applies to the buyer, which it doesn't seem to do.\n\nOption C mentions that she's not guilty if she was unaware of the law. But since the law is strict liability, ignorance of the law is generally not a defense. So, even if she didn't know, she could still be guilty if the law applies to her. But again, the law seems to apply to sellers, not buyers.\n\nOption D suggests that if the legislative intent was not to make purchasing a crime, then she's not guilty. This seems reasonable because the law is about sales, not purchases.\n\nBut wait, sometimes, laws are interpreted broadly to include related actions. Maybe the court could interpret the law in such a way that the act of purchasing by a minor is also prohibited.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, the statute only prohibits selling to minors, not buying by minors.\n\nTherefore, unless there's another law that prohibits minors from buying firearms, which isn't mentioned here, the 15-year-old shouldn't be found guilty under this statute.\n\nSo, the answer is D: Not guilty, provided that the legislative intent was not to make the purchase of shotguns a criminal offense.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nSuppose the legislative intent was to prevent minors from obtaining firearms, and the law was phrased to prohibit sales to minors. Maybe the assumption is that by prohibiting sales, you're also preventing minors from buying. But what if a minor tries to buy anyway?\n\nIn this case, the minor went into the store, picked out the gun, and left the money on the counter when the cashier wasn't there. So, technically, there was no one to complete the sale. The minor took the initiative to take the gun and leave the money.\n\nIs this considered an attempted purchase? Or is it theft, since she took the gun without the seller's consent?\n\nWait, that's another angle. Maybe she could be charged with theft or something else, but not under this particular statute.\n\nBut the question specifies that she's being prosecuted for violating this state statute.\n\nGiven that, and considering the statute only prohibits selling to minors, it seems that she shouldn't be found guilty under this law.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
