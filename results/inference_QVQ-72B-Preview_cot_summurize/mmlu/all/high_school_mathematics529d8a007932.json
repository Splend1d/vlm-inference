                    "text": "So I have this problem here: If \\( f(x) = 2 \\) for all real numbers \\( x \\), what is the value of \\( f(x + 2) \\)? And there are options A. 2, B. 4, C. 0, D. 1.\n\nOkay, let's see. The function is defined as \\( f(x) = 2 \\) for any real number \\( x \\). That means no matter what value I plug in for \\( x \\), the function always returns 2. So, it's a constant function, right?\n\nNow, the question is asking for \\( f(x + 2) \\). So, I need to evaluate this function at \\( x + 2 \\), whatever \\( x \\) may be.\n\nSince \\( f(x) \\) is always 2, I think \\( f(x + 2) \\) should also be 2. But let me think carefully.\n\nIs there any possibility that plugging in \\( x + 2 \\) could change the value of the function? Well, no, because the function doesn't depend on \\( x \\) in any way; it's just always 2.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a trick here. The problem says \"for all real numbers \\( x \\)\", so \\( x + 2 \\) is also a real number if \\( x \\) is a real number. So, \\( f(x + 2) \\) should still be 2.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose \\( x = 1 \\), then \\( x + 2 = 3 \\). Plugging into the function, \\( f(3) = 2 \\), which matches the definition.\n\nWhat if \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( x + 2 = 2 \\), and \\( f(2) = 2 \\). Still the same.\n\nHmm, maybe I should think about negative numbers. Let's say \\( x = -1 \\), then \\( x + 2 = 1 \\), and again, \\( f(1) = 2 \\).\n\nIt seems consistent. The function always outputs 2, regardless of the input.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the definition of a function. A function assigns exactly one output to each input. Here, the input is \\( x + 2 \\), which is just another real number, and the output is always 2.\n\nI don't see any reason why \\( f(x + 2) \\) would be anything other than 2.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a misunderstanding about the notation. Is \\( f(x + 2) \\) being interpreted as \\( f \\) of \\( x + 2 \\), or is it something else?\n\nThe problem seems clear: \\( f(x) = 2 \\) for all real \\( x \\), and we need to find \\( f(x + 2) \\). So, it's just evaluating the function at \\( x + 2 \\).\n\nGiven that, and based on the earlier reasoning, it should be 2.\n\nBut let's look at the options again:\n\nA. 2\n\nB. 4\n\nC. 0\n\nD. 1\n\nIf my reasoning is correct, the answer should be A. 2.\n\nBut maybe there's a twist. Perhaps the function is being composed in some way, or there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the function is supposed to be evaluated at \\( x \\) and then added to 2, like \\( f(x) + 2 \\), but the notation looks like \\( f(x + 2) \\), which is different.\n\nNo, the problem clearly says \\( f(x + 2) \\), so it's the function evaluated at \\( x + 2 \\).\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The answer should simply be 2.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the function. \\( f(x) = 2 \\) is a constant function. It's like a horizontal line at y = 2 on a graph. No matter what \\( x \\) is, \\( y \\) is always 2.\n\nTherefore, \\( f(x + 2) \\) is just plugging in \\( x + 2 \\) into the function, which always gives 2.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 2} \\]"
