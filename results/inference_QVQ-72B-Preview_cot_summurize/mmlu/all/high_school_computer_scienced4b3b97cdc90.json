                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about digital images and lossless transformations. So, first things first, I need to understand what a lossless transformation is. From what I recall, lossless means that the transformation can be reversed, right? Like, no information is lost in the process, so you can go back to the original image if you want.\n\nOkay, so looking at the options:\n\nA. Compressing the image in a way that may lose information but will suffer only a small loss of image quality.\n\nHmm, this sounds like lossy compression. Things like JPEG compression can sometimes remove some data to make the file smaller, but that means some information is lost and can't be recovered. So, this probably isn't lossless.\n\nB. Creating the gray scale of an image by averaging the amounts of red, green, and blue in each pixel and assigning this new value to the corresponding pixel in the new image. The new value of each pixel represents a shade of gray, ranging from white to black.\n\nSo, this is converting a color image to grayscale. When you do that, you're taking the color information and reducing it to shades of gray. But, in doing so, you're losing the color information. Once you have the grayscale image, you can't go back and recover the original colors. So, this seems like a lossy transformation because you've lost the color data.\n\nC. Creating the negative of an image by creating a new RGB triplet for each pixel in which each value is calculated by subtracting the original value from 255. The negative of an image is reversed from the original; light areas appear dark, and colors are reversed.\n\nAlright, so making a negative of an image involves inverting the color values. So, for each color channel (red, green, blue), you subtract the original value from 255. For example, if a pixel was red with value 200, its new red value would be 55 (255 - 200). This reverses the colors and brightness.\n\nNow, the question is, can you reverse this transformation to get back the original image? If you take the negative of the negative, you should get the original image back, right? Because negating twice should cancel out.\n\nWait, but let's think about it. If you have original values, you invert them to get the negative, and then invert again, you should get the original values back. For example, original red is 200, negative is 55, negative of negative is 200 again.\n\nSo, this seems reversible. You can apply the same operation again to get back to the original. Therefore, this is a lossless transformation because no information is lost; you can go back and forth between the original and the negative without any data being permanently discarded.\n\nD. Modifying part of the image by taking the pixels in one part of the picture and copying them to the pixels in another part of the picture.\n\nThis sounds like copying and pasting a section of the image onto another section. So, you're overwriting some pixels with others. But, in this process, the original pixels in the target area are being replaced, and you might lose that information unless you keep a backup.\n\nHowever, if you're just moving pixels around without discarding any, and you keep all the original data, maybe in some temporary storage, then it could be lossless. But, in practice, if you're overwriting the original image, you might be losing the data of the area you're pasting over.\n\nBut, to be honest, I'm a bit unsure about this one. It depends on how the operation is implemented. If the original image is being overwritten without keeping a copy of the overwritten pixels, then you might be losing information.\n\nGiven that, it's probably not a lossless transformation because you can't necessarily go back to the original image if you've lost some pixel data.\n\nSo, comparing all the options:\n\nA. Lossy compression \u2013 definitely lossy.\n\nB. Grayscale conversion \u2013 loses color information, so lossy.\n\nC. Negative transformation \u2013 reversible, lossless.\n\nD. Modifying part of the image \u2013 potentially lossy, depending on implementation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In image editing software, when you apply a negative effect, it's usually a reversible operation. You can apply it and then undo it to get back to the original image.\n\nMoreover, the mathematical operation of inverting the color values is invertible, as shown earlier with the example of 200 -> 55 -> 200.\n\nSo, yeah, I think C is the right answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any chance of data loss in option C. If you apply the negative transformation and then apply it again, you should get the original image back exactly. There's no information being discarded in this process; it's just inverting the colors, which is a reversible operation.\n\nTherefore, option C is indeed a lossless transformation.\n\nSo, the final answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
