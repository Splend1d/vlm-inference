                    "text": "So I've got this problem here with two statements about group theory, and I need to determine whether each statement is true or false. Let's take them one at a time.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: \"If H and K are subgroups of a group G, then |HK| = |H||K| / |H intersection K|.\"\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to recall what HK represents in group theory. HK is the set of all products hk where h is in H and k is in K. So, HK = {hk | h \u2208 H, k \u2208 K}. Now, the order of HK, denoted |HK|, is supposed to be equal to the product of the orders of H and K divided by the order of their intersection, |H \u2229 K|.\n\nThis looks familiar. I think this is a standard formula in group theory, but I want to make sure I understand why it's true.\n\nLet me think about the elements in HK. Each element is of the form hk, where h is from H and k is from K. But since H and K are subgroups, their elements interact in a specific way when multiplied.\n\nI recall that the formula |HK| = |H||K| / |H \u2229 K| is a consequence of the Second Counting Formula or the Orbit-Counting Lemma in group actions, but I might be mixing things up. Maybe I should consider the index or the number of distinct cosets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of double cosets or something similar. Wait, maybe it's simpler than that.\n\nLet me consider the number of distinct elements in HK. If H and K are subgroups, and their intersection is non-trivial, meaning |H \u2229 K| > 1, then some products hk might repeat, right?\n\nFor example, if h1 and h2 are in H, and k1 and k2 are in K, but h1k1 = h2k2, then there's a repetition in HK.\n\nSo, to count the distinct elements in HK, I need to account for these repetitions.\n\nI think the formula |HK| = |H||K| / |H \u2229 K| accounts for that by dividing by the order of the intersection.\n\nLet me try to see why this is the case.\n\nI recall that the number of distinct left cosets of K in G is |G| / |K|, and similarly for H.\n\nBut here, we're dealing with products of elements from H and K.\n\nMaybe I should consider the number of ways to write hk for h in H and k in K, and then see how many of these are distinct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the size of the set HK in terms of the size of H and K and their intersection.\n\nWait a minute, there's a formula in set theory that relates the sizes of unions of sets: |H \u222a K| = |H| + |K| - |H \u2229 K|.\n\nBut here, we're dealing with the product set HK, not the union.\n\nSo, that's a different thing.\n\nMaybe I should look up the formula for the order of the product of two subgroups.\n\nUpon a quick recall, I remember that in general, for subgroups H and K of G, the order of HK is given by |H||K| / |H \u2229 K|.\n\nYes, that seems to be a standard formula.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should verify it.\n\nLet me consider the set HK.\n\nI can think of HK as a set of cosets of K in G, but adjusted for H.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of distinct products hk.\n\nLet me consider fixing an element h in H and seeing how many distinct hk's we get as k varies over K.\n\nIf H and K have a non-trivial intersection, then some of these products might coincide for different k's.\n\nSpecifically, if h(k1) = h(k2), then k1 = k2, because H is a subgroup and h is fixed.\n\nWait, no. Actually, h(k1) = h(k2) implies that h(k1)h^{-1} = k2, so k1 and k2 are related by conjugation.\n\nBut since H and K are subgroups, their intersection might affect this relationship.\n\nThis is getting a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider the formula |HK| = |H||K| / |H \u2229 K| and see if it makes sense in a specific example.\n\nTake G = Z_6, the integers modulo 6 under addition.\n\nLet H = <2> = {0, 2, 4} and K = <3> = {0, 3}.\n\nThen, HK would be H + K = {0+0, 0+3, 2+0, 2+3, 4+0, 4+3} = {0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 1} = Z_6.\n\nSo, |HK| = 6.\n\nNow, |H| = 3, |K| = 2, and |H \u2229 K| = |{0}| = 1.\n\nPlugging into the formula: |HK| = 3*2 / 1 = 6, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nOkay, that's one example where it works.\n\nLet me try another example to see if it holds in general.\n\nConsider G = S_3, the symmetric group on three letters.\n\nLet H = {e, (12)}, and K = {e, (13)}.\n\nThen, HK would be the set of all products of elements from H and K.\n\nLet's list them out:\n\ne*e = e\n\ne*(13) = (13)\n\n(12)*e = (12)\n\n(12)*(13) = (12)(13) = (132)\n\nSo, HK = {e, (13), (12), (132)}, which has 4 elements.\n\nNow, |H| = 2, |K| = 2, and |H \u2229 K| = |{e}| = 1.\n\nAccording to the formula, |HK| = 2*2 / 1 = 4, which matches our calculation.\n\nAnother example where it works.\n\nLet me try one more example where H and K have a non-trivial intersection.\n\nTake G = Z_4, H = <2> = {0, 2}, and K = <2> = {0, 2}.\n\nThen, HK = H + K = {0+0, 0+2, 2+0, 2+2} = {0, 2, 2, 0} = {0, 2}.\n\nSo, |HK| = 2.\n\nNow, |H| = 2, |K| = 2, and |H \u2229 K| = |{0, 2}| = 2.\n\nPlugging into the formula: |HK| = 2*2 / 2 = 2, which matches.\n\nOkay, so in all these examples, the formula holds.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, maybe I should look up the formal proof or recall the reasoning behind it.\n\nI recall that the set HK can be thought of as a union of left cosets of K in G.\n\nSpecifically, HK = \u222a_{h \u2208 H} hK.\n\nNow, the number of distinct hK for h in H is equal to the index of K in G, but adjusted for the intersection.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the number of distinct cosets hK for h in H.\n\nIf H and K have a non-trivial intersection, then some of these cosets hK might coincide for different h's.\n\nSpecifically, h1K = h2K if and only if h1^{-1}h2 \u2208 K.\n\nBut since h1 and h2 are in H, h1^{-1}h2 is in H \u2229 K.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct hK for h in H is equal to the index of H \u2229 K in H, which is |H| / |H \u2229 K|.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct elements in HK is equal to |K| * (|H| / |H \u2229 K|) = |H||K| / |H \u2229 K|.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nSo, the formula |HK| = |H||K| / |H \u2229 K| is indeed correct for subgroups H and K of G.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nNow, moving on to Statement 2: \"A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\"\n\nAlright, so I need to determine if this statement is true.\n\nI know that D_p refers to the dihedral group of order 2p, which represents the symmetries of a regular p-gon.\n\nSo, the statement is saying that any group of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, is either cyclic or isomorphic to the dihedral group D_p.\n\nLet me recall some group theory facts about groups of order 2p.\n\nFirst, since p is an odd prime, 2 and p are distinct primes.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow p-subgroups divides 2 and is congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nSo, the number of Sylow p-subgroups is either 1 or 2.\n\nIf there's only one Sylow p-subgroup, it's normal in G.\n\nSimilarly, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups divides p and is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n\nSince p is odd, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups is either 1 or p.\n\nIf there's only one Sylow 2-subgroup, it's normal in G.\n\nSo, in this case, we have:\n\n- If there's a unique Sylow p-subgroup and a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, both are normal, and their product is G since their orders multiply to |G| and their intersection is trivial (only the identity).\n\nIn this case, G would be the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, which would make G cyclic if both subgroups are cyclic, which they are since p is prime and 2 is prime.\n\nWait, actually, a group of order p is cyclic, and a group of order 2 is cyclic.\n\nSo, their direct product would indeed be cyclic.\n\nTherefore, in this case, G is cyclic.\n\nNow, if there's only one Sylow p-subgroup, say H, which is normal, and more than one Sylow 2-subgroup, say K is one of them.\n\nThen, since H is normal, we can form the semidirect product of H and K.\n\nThe semidirect product depends on the action of K on H.\n\nIn this case, since |K| = 2, K is isomorphic to Z_2, which has only the trivial automorphism.\n\nWait, no. Z_2 has an automorphism of order 2, which is inversion.\n\nBut in general, Aut(Z_p) is isomorphic to Z_{p-1}, since Z_p is cyclic.\n\nBut p is an odd prime, so |Aut(Z_p)| = p-1, which is even.\n\nSince |K| = 2, by the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem or just by considering the action, there are two possibilities for the semidirect product:\n\n1. The trivial action, where K acts trivially on H, resulting in the direct product, which is cyclic.\n\n2. A non-trivial action, where K acts non-trivially on H.\n\nIn the non-trivial case, the resulting group is the semidirect product of H and K, which in this context is isomorphic to D_p.\n\nSo, in this scenario, G is either cyclic (if both Sylow subgroups are normal) or isomorphic to D_p (if only the Sylow p-subgroup is normal).\n\nNow, what if there are two Sylow p-subgroups?\n\nWell, if there are two Sylow p-subgroups, neither is normal in G.\n\nSimilarly, if there are p Sylow 2-subgroups, neither is normal.\n\nBut p is an odd prime, so p > 2.\n\nIf there are p Sylow 2-subgroups, that would mean there are p subgroups of order 2.\n\nEach subgroup of order 2 contributes one non-identity element, but since p is odd, this would mean there are p elements of order 2 in G.\n\nBut |G| = 2p, so accounting for the identity and p elements of order 2, that leaves p - 1 elements unaccounted for.\n\nBut p is an odd prime, so p - 1 is even.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because in a group of order 2p, with p odd, if there are p Sylow 2-subgroups, that would imply p elements of order 2, plus the identity, totaling p + 1 elements.\n\nBut |G| = 2p, so there would be p - 1 elements left, which must form a Sylow p-subgroup.\n\nBut if there are two Sylow p-subgroups, neither is normal, which seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me recall that in a group of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, by Sylow's theorems:\n\n- The number of Sylow p-subgroups, n_p, divides 2 and is congruent to 1 mod p.\n\n- The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides p and is congruent to 1 mod 2.\n\nSince p is odd, n_2 can be 1 or p.\n\nIf n_p = 1, then the Sylow p-subgroup is normal.\n\nIf n_p = 2, then there are two Sylow p-subgroups, neither of which is normal.\n\nSimilarly, n_2 can be 1 or p.\n\nIf n_2 = 1, the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal.\n\nIf n_2 = p, there are p Sylow 2-subgroups.\n\nNow, considering these possibilities:\n\nCase 1: n_p = 1 and n_2 = 1.\n\nBoth Sylow subgroups are normal.\n\nThen, G is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, which are cyclic of orders p and 2, so G is cyclic of order 2p.\n\nCase 2: n_p = 1 and n_2 > 1.\n\nOnly the Sylow p-subgroup is normal.\n\nThen, G is the semidirect product of the Sylow p-subgroup and a Sylow 2-subgroup.\n\nSince |Aut(Z_p)| = p - 1, and |K| = 2, there are two possible actions: trivial and non-trivial.\n\nThe trivial action gives the direct product, which is cyclic.\n\nThe non-trivial action gives the dihedral group D_p.\n\nBut since we already have the cyclic case in Case 1, in this case, G is isomorphic to D_p.\n\nCase 3: n_p > 1 and n_2 = 1.\n\nOnly the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal.\n\nThen, G is the semidirect product of the Sylow p-subgroups and the normal Sylow 2-subgroup.\n\nBut since there are two Sylow p-subgroups, neither is normal, which might complicate things.\n\nWait, if the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, and the Sylow p-subgroups are not, does that lead to a different group structure?\n\nI think in this case, since the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, we can still form a semidirect product with one of the Sylow p-subgroups.\n\nBut since there are two Sylow p-subgroups, neither is normal, which might imply that the action is non-trivial, leading again to D_p.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this case is already covered in Case 2.\n\nWait, perhaps in this case, G is still isomorphic to D_p.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another possibility.\n\nI need to think carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this case, G is isomorphic to D_p as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no other possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the structure of D_p.\n\nD_p is the dihedral group of order 2p, which has a cyclic subgroup of order p and a subgroup of order 2 acting on it via inversion.\n\nSo, in D_p, there is a normal cyclic subgroup of order p and a subgroup of order 2 acting on it non-trivially.\n\nIn our Case 3, if the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, and the Sylow p-subgroups are not, does that fit with D_p?\n\nWait, in D_p, the cyclic subgroup of order p is normal, and the subgroup of order 2 is not normal (unless p = 2, but p is odd here).\n\nWait, no. In D_p, the cyclic subgroup of order p is normal, and the subgroup of order 2 is not normal.\n\nBut in our Case 3, the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, and the Sylow p-subgroups are not.\n\nWait, but in D_p, the cyclic subgroup of order p is normal, and the subgroup of order 2 is not normal.\n\nSo, if G is isomorphic to D_p, then the Sylow p-subgroup is normal, but in Case 3, we have n_p > 1, meaning the Sylow p-subgroups are not normal.\n\nThis seems contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misremembering the structure of D_p.\n\nWait, in D_p, the rotations form a normal cyclic subgroup of order p, and the reflections form subgroups of order 2, which are not normal.\n\nBut in our Case 3, the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, which would correspond to one of the reflection subgroups being normal, which contradicts the structure of D_p.\n\nSo, perhaps Case 3 is not possible, or perhaps it leads to a different group structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet me check.\n\nIn D_p, the rotations form a normal cyclic subgroup of order p, and the reflections form subgroups of order 2, which are not normal.\n\nSo, in D_p, the Sylow p-subgroup is normal, and the Sylow 2-subgroups are not.\n\nBut in Case 3, the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, and the Sylow p-subgroups are not.\n\nThis seems inconsistent with D_p.\n\nSo, perhaps in reality, Case 3 is not possible, or perhaps it leads to a different group structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that in a group of order 2p, with p odd, if the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, then the Sylow p-subgroup must also be normal.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nWait, perhaps by the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem, since the Sylow p"
