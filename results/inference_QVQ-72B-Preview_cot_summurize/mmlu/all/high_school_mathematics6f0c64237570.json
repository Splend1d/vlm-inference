                    "text": "So I have this problem about a parallelogram. Let me see if I remember what a parallelogram is. I think it's a quadrilateral where both pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, in parallelogram ABCD, AB is parallel to CD, and AD is parallel to BC.\n\nNow, the problem tells me that angle B measures 110 degrees, and I need to find the measure of angle C.\n\nHmm, I need to recall some properties of parallelograms related to their angles. I remember that in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary. Wait, is that right?\n\nLet me think about opposite angles. If angle B is 110 degrees, then angle D, which is opposite to angle B, should also be 110 degrees. Similarly, angle A, which is opposite to angle C, should be equal to angle C. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me draw a parallelogram to visualize this. Let's label the vertices as A, B, C, and D, with AB parallel to CD and AD parallel to BC.\n\nSo, angle A is opposite to angle C. I think in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, so angle A equals angle C. But the problem gives angle B as 110 degrees, and I need to find angle C.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the fact that consecutive angles in a parallelogram are supplementary. What does supplementary mean again? It means they add up to 180 degrees.\n\nSo, if angle B is 110 degrees, then angle C, being consecutive to angle B, should be 180 degrees minus 110 degrees, which is 70 degrees.\n\nIs that right? Let me check. If angle C is 70 degrees, and angle A is also 70 degrees because opposite angles are equal, and angles B and D are both 110 degrees. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the fact that the sum of all interior angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees. Since a parallelogram is a quadrilateral, the sum of its angles should be 360 degrees.\n\nGiven that angles A and C are equal, and angles B and D are equal, with angle B being 110 degrees, then angle C would be 360 degrees minus two times 110 degrees, which is 360 minus 220, which is 140 degrees. Wait, that's different from what I got earlier.\n\nHmm, I must have done something wrong. If angle B is 110 degrees and angle C is consecutive to angle B, then they should be supplementary, meaning angle C should be 180 - 110 = 70 degrees, as I thought before.\n\nBut according to this other method, angle C is 140 degrees. Which one is correct?\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm confusing something. Let me look up the properties of parallelograms.\n\nOkay, I recall that in a parallelogram:\n\n- Opposite angles are equal.\n\n- Consecutive angles are supplementary.\n\nSo, if angle B is 110 degrees, then angle D is also 110 degrees, being opposite to angle B.\n\nAngle A is consecutive to angle B, so angle A should be 180 - 110 = 70 degrees.\n\nSimilarly, angle C, being opposite to angle A, should also be 70 degrees.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought angle C would be 140 degrees using the sum of all angles being 360 degrees. Let's recalculate that.\n\nIf angle B is 110 degrees, and angle D is also 110 degrees, then angle A and angle C are both equal, say X degrees. So, the sum of angles is X + 110 + 110 + X = 360 degrees.\n\nSimplifying, 2X + 220 = 360.\n\nSubtract 220 from both sides: 2X = 140, so X = 70 degrees.\n\nTherefore, angle C is 70 degrees.\n\nEarlier, I mistakenly thought angle C was 140 degrees by doing 360 - 2*110, but that's incorrect because I should have accounted for both angle A and angle C being equal and then summing all angles to 360 degrees.\n\nSo, the correct measure of angle C is 70 degrees.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 145\n\nB. 90\n\nC. 60\n\nD. 70\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 70.\n\nI think that's it. I remember now that in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary, and opposite angles are equal. So, angle C should indeed be 70 degrees.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can think of another way to confirm this.\n\nImagine the parallelogram with angles labeled as follows:\n\n- Angle A: X degrees\n\n- Angle B: 110 degrees\n\n- Angle C: X degrees\n\n- Angle D: 110 degrees\n\nThe sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees, so:\n\nX + 110 + X + 110 = 360\n\n2X + 220 = 360\n\n2X = 140\n\nX = 70 degrees\n\nYes, that confirms it again.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that consecutive angles are supplementary, angle A and angle B are supplementary:\n\nAngle A + angle B = 180 degrees\n\nAngle A + 110 = 180\n\nAngle A = 70 degrees\n\nSince angle C is opposite to angle A, it must also be 70 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the measure of angle C is 70 degrees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]"
