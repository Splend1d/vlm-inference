                    "text": "So I have this question about the endosymbiotic theory, which suggests that mitochondria and chloroplasts in eukaryotic cells were once their own independent prokaryotes. The question is asking which of the options doesn't support this theory. Let me go through each one to understand better.\n\nOption A says that mitochondria and chloroplasts divide independently of the eukaryotic host cell by a process similar to binary fission. Now, binary fission is a type of reproduction used by prokaryotes like bacteria, where they split into two identical daughter cells. If mitochondria and chloroplasts divide in a similar way, that seems to support the idea that they were once prokaryotes because they're using a similar reproductive mechanism. So, this should be supporting the theory, right?\n\nOption B mentions that mitochondria and chloroplasts have ribosomes that are more similar to those of bacteria than to those of eukaryotic cells. Ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis in cells, and they differ between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Prokaryotes have smaller ribosomes (70S) compared to eukaryotes (80S). If mitochondria and chloroplasts have ribosomes that are more like prokaryotic ones, that again suggests a closer relationship to prokaryotes, supporting the endosymbiotic theory.\n\nOption C states that mitochondria and chloroplasts function independently from the eukaryotic host cell. Hmm, this one seems a bit tricky. While it's true that these organelles have some autonomy, they are still deeply integrated with the host cell's metabolism and functions. For example, mitochondria produce energy in the form of ATP, which is used by the entire cell, and chloroplasts perform photosynthesis, which benefits the whole plant cell. So, although they have some independent processes, they are still interdependent with the host cell. Maybe this option is suggesting that if they function completely independently, that might contradict the idea that they were once separate prokaryotes, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nOption D says that mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria have a single, circular chromosome without histones or proteins. In eukaryotic cells, DNA is typically found in the nucleus and is associated with histone proteins to form chromatin. Prokaryotes, on the other hand, have their genetic material in a single circular chromosome that isn't associated with histones. If mitochondria and chloroplasts also have this type of DNA structure, that would be another piece of evidence supporting their prokaryotic ancestry.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, A, B, and D seem to directly support the endosymbiotic theory by highlighting similarities between mitochondria/chloroplasts and prokaryotes in terms of division, ribosomes, and DNA structure. Option C, however, seems a bit ambiguous. It says that these organelles function independently from the host cell, but in reality, while they do have some autonomous functions, they are still very much integrated into the cell's overall metabolism and rely on the host cell for many resources and signals.\n\nPerhaps the key here is that they function \"independently,\" but in reality, there is a high degree of interdependence between the organelles and the host cell. So, if they were truly independent in their functions, that might contradict the endosymbiotic theory, which posits that they were once free-living prokaryotes but have since become symbiotic with the host cell, developing interdependent relationships.\n\nTherefore, the statement in option C might not fully capture the symbiotic nature of these organelles within the eukaryotic cell, making it an exception to the evidence supporting the endosymbiotic theory.\n\nSo, my answer would be C. Mitochondria and chloroplasts function independently from the eukaryotic host cell.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
