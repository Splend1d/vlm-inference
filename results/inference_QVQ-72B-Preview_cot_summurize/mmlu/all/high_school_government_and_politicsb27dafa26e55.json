                    "text": "So I've got this quote here: \"We conclude that in the field of education the doctrine of 'separate but equal' has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.\" And I need to match this quote to one of the Supreme Court cases listed\u2014Gideon v. Wainwright, Marbury v. Madison, Engel v. Vitale, or Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I remember that the doctrine of \"separate but equal\" was a principle established by the Supreme Court in the late 19th century, specifically in the case of Plessy v. Ferguson. It basically said that as long as separate facilities for different races were equal, it was constitutional. But this quote seems to be saying that even if they're equal, separate facilities are still unequal. So, this must be a case that overturned or challenged that doctrine.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Gideon v. Wainwright: I think this case was about the right to counsel in criminal proceedings. It had to do with the Sixth Amendment and making sure that poor people had access to a lawyer. Doesn't seem related to school segregation or the \"separate but equal\" doctrine.\n\nB. Marbury v. Madison: This is a foundational case in American constitutional law. It's about judicial review\u2014the power of the courts to strike down laws that violate the Constitution. It was decided way back in 1803, long before the issues of school segregation came up.\n\nC. Engel v. Vitale: This case was about prayer in schools. It dealt with the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, saying that public schools couldn't have official prayers. Again, not directly related to segregation or \"separate but equal.\"\n\nD. Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka: Now, this rings a bell. I think this is the case that ended segregation in public schools. It challenged the \"separate but equal\" doctrine and said that separating children based on race in schools was unconstitutional.\n\nHmm, that seems to fit the quote pretty well. But just to be sure, let me recall some more details.\n\nIn Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court overturned the \"separate but equal\" doctrine in the context of public education. The court ruled that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal, and therefore violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That sounds exactly like the quote provided.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure there's no confusion.\n\nGideon v. Wainwright was about the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel, Marbury v. Madison was about judicial review, and Engel v. Vitale was about the separation of church and state in schools. None of these directly address the issue of segregation or the \"separate but equal\" doctrine in education.\n\nSo, based on this, the correct answer should be D. Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that this quote could be from another case related to segregation? Maybe something after Brown v. Board of Education?\n\nWell, Brown v. Board of Education was decided in 1954, and it's widely recognized as the case that ended legal segregation in public schools. The quote seems to match the famous statement from that decision.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility of misattribution. Could this quote be from a later case that built upon Brown v. Board of Education?\n\nPerhaps, but I don't think so. The language is so iconic that it's almost certainly from the Brown decision itself.\n\nAlright, I'm pretty confident now. The quote is from Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
