                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about horse racing bets. It's asking for the term used when you wager on the first, second, and third place finishers in a specific race. The options are A. triple action, B. trifecta, C. exacta, and D. triple crown. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that in horse racing, there are different types of bets you can make beyond just picking the outright winner. There are exactas, trifectas, and other exotic bets that involve predicting the order of finish for multiple horses. So, this question is about one of those.\n\nLet me recall what each term means:\n\nA. Triple action: I'm not as familiar with this one. Maybe it's related to betting on multiple races or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nB. Trifecta: I think a trifecta is a bet where you have to pick the first three horses in the exact order they finish. So, you have to get the winner, the place, and the show, all correct, and in the right sequence.\n\nC. Exacta: An exacta is similar but only involves the first two horses in the exact order. So, you have to pick the winner and the place horse correctly.\n\nD. Triple crown: This one I definitely know. The Triple Crown is a title given to a three-year-old thoroughbred horse who wins three specific races: the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes, all in the same year. It's a very prestigious achievement and doesn't involve betting in the same way as the other options.\n\nSo, based on this, the Triple Crown is about a horse winning three big races, not about betting on multiple positions in a single race. So, that probably eliminates option D.\n\nNow, between triple action, trifecta, and exacta, I need to figure out which one involves betting on the top three finishers in a specific race.\n\nI'm pretty confident that an exacta only covers the top two positions, so that leaves out option C.\n\nTriple action sounds like it might involve multiple bets or perhaps betting on multiple races, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's a type of bet that combines several wagers into one, but again, I don't think it specifically refers to picking the top three finishers in a single race.\n\nTrifecta, on the other hand, seems to fit the description perfectly. It's a bet where you pick the first three horses in the exact order they finish in a single race.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think about it a bit more. Is there any other type of bet that might involve picking the top three finishers in a different way?\n\nThere's something called a \"superfecta,\" which involves picking the top four finishers, but that's not one of the options here. So, that doesn't help.\n\nWait, maybe a daily double, but that's betting on the winners of two consecutive races, not the top three in one race.\n\nWhat about a quinella? That's betting on the first two finishers in any order, which is similar to an exacta but without the order.\n\nNo, that's not quite what we're looking for here. We need the term for betting on the first, second, and third place finishers in a specific race.\n\nLet me consider if there's any variation of trifecta that might change its meaning, but I don't think so. It's pretty standard in horse racing terminology.\n\nI think I've narrowed it down to trifecta being the correct answer because it directly corresponds to betting on the top three finishers in exact order.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll recall if there's any other bet that involves the top three finishers but doesn't require them to be in order. For instance, there's something called a \"trifecta box,\" which allows you to pick the top three horses without specifying the order, but that's a variation of the trifecta, not a different type of bet.\n\nSo, the basic trifecta bet requires picking the top three horses in the exact order, which matches the question's description.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B. trifecta.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. trifecta}} \\]"
