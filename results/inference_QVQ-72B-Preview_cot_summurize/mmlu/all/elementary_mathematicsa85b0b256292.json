                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. The store manager orders 81 shirts, and each shipping box can hold 9 shirts. I need to figure out how many shipping boxes are needed for all those shirts. Let's see, I think this is a division problem. I need to divide the total number of shirts by the number of shirts per box.\n\nSo, 81 divided by 9. Let me try that. 9 times 9 is 81, right? Wait, that seems too straightforward. Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe I should double-check that.\n\nLet me think about multiplication. If each box has 9 shirts, and I have 9 boxes, then 9 times 9 is indeed 81. So, that seems correct. But just to be sure, maybe I should think about it differently.\n\nPerhaps I can use repeated addition. Starting from 0, adding 9 each time until I reach 81. Let's do that: 0, 9 (which is 1 box), 18 (2 boxes), 27 (3 boxes), 36 (4 boxes), 45 (5 boxes), 54 (6 boxes), 63 (7 boxes), 72 (8 boxes), 81 (9 boxes). Yep, that confirms it's 9 boxes.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there are any leftover shirts. Like, if the number of shirts isn't exactly divisible by the number of shirts per box, I might need an extra box. But in this case, 81 is exactly divisible by 9, so no leftovers. So, no need for extra boxes.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA. 8\n\nB. 9\n\nC. 72\n\nD. 90\n\nSo, based on my calculations, the answer should be B. 9.\n\nBut let me think if there's any other way to interpret the question. Maybe the number of shirts is not being asked for, but perhaps something else. Wait, the question is clear: \"how many shipping boxes are needed for all of the shirts ordered?\" So, it's asking for the number of boxes, not the number of shirts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trick here where some boxes are partially filled. But no, since 81 is exactly divisible by 9, there shouldn't be any partial boxes.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the formula: number of boxes = total shirts divided by shirts per box. So, boxes = 81 \u00f7 9 = 9. That seems straightforward.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The answer should simply be 9 boxes.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect this. Suppose there's a limit on how many boxes can be shipped at once, but no, the problem doesn't mention that. Or maybe the boxes have to be filled to capacity, but again, the problem states that each box holds 9 shirts, and we have exactly 81 shirts, which is a multiple of 9.\n\nI feel confident now that the correct answer is 9 boxes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 9} \\]"
