                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Asking the 'miracle question' is an initial intervention in which type of therapy?\" And the options are A. transtheoretical, B. interpersonal, C. REBT, and D. solution-focused. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these therapy types uses something called the 'miracle question' as an initial intervention.\n\nFirst off, I should probably understand what the 'miracle question' is. From what I recall, the 'miracle question' is a technique used in therapy where the therapist asks the client to imagine that a miracle has happened and their problem has been solved. Then, the therapist tries to explore what the client's life would look like after this miracle, and what small steps they can take to move towards that desired outcome. It seems like a way to focus on solutions rather than dwelling on the problem itself.\n\nNow, I need to match this technique with the correct type of therapy from the options given.\n\nLet me start by eliminating the ones that don't fit.\n\nOption A is transtheoretical. I'm not super familiar with transtheoretical therapy, but from what I remember, it's more about integrating techniques from different therapeutic approaches rather than having a specific technique like the miracle question. So, maybe it's not the best fit.\n\nOption B is interpersonal therapy. Interpersonal therapy focuses on improving interpersonal relationships and resolving interpersonal problems. It doesn't sound like the miracle question is a central technique in this approach. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think so.\n\nOption C is REBT, which stands for Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. This therapy emphasizes identifying and challenging irrational beliefs and replacing them with more rational ones. Again, doesn't seem directly related to the miracle question. So, probably not the answer.\n\nThat leaves option D: solution-focused therapy. This sounds promising because it emphasizes finding solutions and building on strengths, rather than focusing on problems. The miracle question seems aligned with this approach, as it helps clients visualize a desired future and work towards it.\n\nLet me double-check this. In solution-focused therapy, therapists often use techniques that help clients identify their goals and the steps needed to achieve them. The miracle question is a classic example of such a technique, where clients are asked to imagine that their problems have been magically solved, and then reflect on what changes have occurred and how they can bring about those changes in reality.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. So, I think the correct answer is D. solution-focused therapy.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly recap why I think the other options are less likely:\n\nA. transtheoretical: This is more about combining elements from different therapies rather than having a specific technique like the miracle question.\n\nB. interpersonal therapy: This focuses on relationships and interpersonal issues, not specifically on solution-oriented techniques.\n\nC. REBT: This therapy is centered around changing irrational beliefs, which isn't directly related to the miracle question.\n\nD. solution-focused: This therapy emphasizes solutions and future-oriented thinking, which perfectly fits the miracle question.\n\nSo, I'm confident that D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. solution-focused}} \\]"
