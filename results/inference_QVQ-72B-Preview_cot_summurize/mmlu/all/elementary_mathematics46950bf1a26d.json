                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about John and his friend telling him he can earn $49 for handing out flyers at a local concert. He works a total of 3.5 hours, and the equation given is 3.5x = 49, where x is his hourly rate in dollars. I need to find out what his hourly rate is, and there are four options: $1.40, $14.00, $45.50, or $171.50.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what the equation means. The equation is 3.5x = 49. Here, x represents the hourly rate, and 3.5 is the number of hours he works. So, if you multiply his hourly rate by the number of hours, you get the total earnings, which is $49.\n\nTo find the hourly rate, I need to solve for x. That means I have to get x by itself on one side of the equation. Since 3.5 is multiplied by x, the opposite operation would be division. So, if I divide both sides of the equation by 3.5, I should be able to find the value of x.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n3.5x / 3.5 = 49 / 3.5\n\nOn the left side, 3.5 divided by 3.5 is 1, so that leaves me with x. On the right side, I need to divide 49 by 3.5 to find the value of x.\n\nHmm, dividing 49 by 3.5. Let's see, 3.5 times 14 is... well, I know that 3.5 times 10 is 35, and 3.5 times 4 is 14, so 3.5 times 14 is 49.\n\nWait, actually, that's not right. Let me double-check that.\n\nWait, 3.5 times 10 is 35, and 3.5 times 4 is 14, so 35 plus 14 is 49. So, yes, 3.5 times 14 is indeed 49. Therefore, x equals 14.\n\nBut let's make sure that's correct. If x is $14 per hour, then working 3.5 hours would be 14 times 3.5, which we just calculated as 49. Yes, that matches the total earnings given.\n\nSo, the hourly rate is $14.00.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe I can set up the equation differently or use another approach to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to rearrange the equation to solve for x directly. So, if 3.5 times x equals 49, then x equals 49 divided by 3.5.\n\nLet me try that calculation again. 49 divided by 3.5.\n\nWell, 3.5 times 14 is 49, as I thought before. So, again, x equals 14.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert 3.5 hours into a fraction or use decimals to make the division easier, but I think I've already confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nLooking back at the options, $1.40 seems too low, $45.50 is higher than $14.00, and $171.50 is way higher. So, based on my calculations, $14.00 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the hourly rate. For example, if there were any additional costs or if the total earnings included tips or anything else, but the problem states that the total earnings are $49 for 3.5 hours, and the equation is 3.5x = 49, which suggests that there are no other deductions or additions; it's a straightforward calculation of hourly rate based on total earnings divided by hours worked.\n\nTherefore, the hourly rate is indeed $14.00.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. $14.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ \\$14.00} \\]"
