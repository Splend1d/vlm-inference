The question is referring to Esman's classification from 1972, and it's asking which type of public is related to an organization through shared industrial interests. The options are Enabling, Functional, Normative, and Diffused publics.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Esman means by these different types of publics. Since it's from 1972, I might need to recall some classic PR theories. Let me think about each type:\n\nA. Enabling publics: From what I remember, enabling publics are those that provide resources or support to an organization, like investors, suppliers, or even government agencies that might provide grants or licenses.\n\nB. Functional publics: This sounds like publics that the organization interacts with in day-to-day operations, perhaps customers or clients who use their services regularly.\n\nC. Normative publics: This might refer to publics that share common values or norms with the organization, possibly industry peers or professional associations where there are shared standards or practices.\n\nD. Diffused publics: This could be more general publics that aren't directly involved with the organization but might have some awareness or opinion about it, like the general community or media.\n\nThe question mentions \"shared industrial interests.\" So, I need to find which of these publics are connected to the organization based on common interests in the industry.\n\nLet me consider each option again in relation to industrial interests:\n\n- Enabling publics: While investors and suppliers might have their own interests aligned with the organization, it's not necessarily about shared industrial interests. They might be more focused on financial returns or business relationships.\n\n- Functional publics: Customers and regular clients might share some interests with the organization, but again, their primary concern is usually getting the product or service they need.\n\n- Normative publics: This seems promising. If these are publics that share common values or norms, and specifically in the context of the industry, then they likely have shared industrial interests. For example, if the organization is part of the tech industry, normative publics might include other tech companies or professionals who adhere to similar industry standards and practices.\n\n- Diffused publics: The general community or media might have an interest in the organization's impact on the industry, but it's not a direct shared interest in the same way that industry peers would have.\n\nBased on this analysis, it seems like normative publics are the ones that share industrial interests with the organization. So, the answer should be C. Normative.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. Is there any chance that another type could also fit?\n\nFor example, could functional publics also have shared industrial interests? Well, yes, customers might have some interest in the industry, but their primary focus is usually on the products or services they receive, not necessarily on the broader industrial concerns.\n\nEnabling publics, like investors, might be interested in the industry's performance, but again, their main concern is likely financial return rather than shared industrial interests.\n\nDiffused publics, such as the general public, might have an interest in the industry's impact on society or the economy, but again, this is more peripheral compared to normative publics.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is C. Normative publics.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
