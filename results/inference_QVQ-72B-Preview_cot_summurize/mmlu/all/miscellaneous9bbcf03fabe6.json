I think if a pitcher throws a certain number of balls to a batter, the batter can walk to first base. But I'm not sure how many balls exactly. Let me see.\n\nOption A is one. That doesn't seem right. If a pitcher throws one ball, the batter might take it, but they usually need more than that to get a walk.\n\nOption B is two. Hmm, I don't think it's two. I remember something about three or four.\n\nOption C is three. That sounds possible. Maybe three balls and the batter walks.\n\nOption D is four. That also sounds familiar. Maybe it's four.\n\nWait, I think it's four. Four balls and the batter gets a walk to first base. Let me confirm that.\n\nI recall that in baseball, when a pitcher throws four balls outside the strike zone, the batter is awarded a base on balls, which is commonly called a walk. So, that would mean the answer is four.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me think about it differently. Maybe I should consider the standard rules of baseball.\n\nIn baseball, a strike is when the pitcher throws the ball within the strike zone and the batter doesn't swing, or the batter swings and misses, or the batter hits the ball foul.\n\nA ball is when the pitcher throws the ball outside the strike zone and the batter doesn't swing.\n\nEach batter starts with a count of zero balls and zero strikes. During the at-bat, the count can go up to four balls or three strikes.\n\nIf the count reaches four balls, the batter is awarded first base, which is the walk.\n\nIf the count reaches three strikes, the batter is out.\n\nSo, according to this, it's four balls for a walk.\n\nBut wait, I've heard something about a third strike being different sometimes. Like, if the catcher doesn't catch it, the batter can run. But that's about strikes, not balls.\n\nAlso, sometimes a pitch can be both a ball and a strike depending on the situation, but generally, it's four balls for a walk.\n\nLet me check online or recall if there are any exceptions or different rules in different leagues.\n\nNo, I think it's consistent across all levels of baseball: four balls equal a walk.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. four.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider a scenario: A pitcher throws three balls and one strike. What happens?\n\nWell, the count is three balls and one strike. If the next pitch is a ball, that would make it four balls, and the batter walks to first base.\n\nIf the next pitch is a strike, it's a strikeout.\n\nSo, yeah, four balls are needed for a walk.\n\nI think I'm confident with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
