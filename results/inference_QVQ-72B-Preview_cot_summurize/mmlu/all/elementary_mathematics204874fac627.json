                    "text": "Let's see. Ty has 12 weeks to read books, and he spends 2 weeks on each book. I need to find out how many books he can read in total. So, if he spends 2 weeks per book, and he has 12 weeks total, I think I should divide the total weeks by the weeks per book.\n\nSo, 12 weeks divided by 2 weeks per book would give me the number of books. Let me calculate that: 12 divided by 2 is 6. So, he can read 6 books in total.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them show a division operation. Option A is 12 \u2013 2, which is 10. That doesn't make sense because that would suggest he's reading 10 books, but we just calculated it's 6.\n\nOption B is 12 + 12, which is 24. That's more than double the total weeks he has, so that doesn't seem right either.\n\nOption C is 12 \u2013 2 \u2013 2 \u2013 2 \u2013 2 \u2013 2 \u2013 2. Let me see, if I subtract 2 seven times: 12 minus 2 is 10, minus 2 is 8, minus 2 is 6, minus 2 is 4, minus 2 is 2, and minus 2 is 0. So, that would mean he reads 6 books, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nOption D is 12 \u2013 2 \u2013 2 \u2013 2 \u2013 2 \u2013 2 \u2013 2 \u2013 2. Subtracting 2 eight times: 12 minus 2 is 10, minus 2 is 8, minus 2 is 6, minus 2 is 4, minus 2 is 2, minus 2 is 0, minus 2 is -2. That doesn't make sense because you can't read negative books.\n\nSo, option C seems to be the correct choice because it subtracts 2 seven times, resulting in 0, which means he reads 6 books in 12 weeks, spending 2 weeks per book.\n\nWait a minute, but is there a better way to express this? Like using division, but since division isn't shown in the options, maybe repeated subtraction is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expression should reflect the number of books he can read by subtracting the weeks spent on each book from the total weeks until he has no weeks left.\n\nSo, starting with 12 weeks, subtracting 2 weeks for each book:\n\nBook 1: 12 - 2 = 10 weeks left\n\nBook 2: 10 - 2 = 8 weeks left\n\nBook 3: 8 - 2 = 6 weeks left\n\nBook 4: 6 - 2 = 4 weeks left\n\nBook 5: 4 - 2 = 2 weeks left\n\nBook 6: 2 - 2 = 0 weeks left\n\nSo, he can read 6 books in total, which aligns with option C.\n\nI don't think option A, 12 \u2013 2 = 10, makes sense because that would suggest he's reading 10 books, but he only has 12 weeks. That can't be right.\n\nOption B, 12 + 12 = 24, that would be adding the weeks, which doesn't relate to the number of books he can read.\n\nOption D, 12 \u2013 2 \u2013 2 \u2013 2 \u2013 2 \u2013 2 \u2013 2 \u2013 2 = -2, which doesn't make sense because you can't have negative weeks or negative books.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression is option C: 12 \u2013 2 \u2013 2 \u2013 2 \u2013 2 \u2013 2 \u2013 2, which equals 0, indicating he has read 6 books in 12 weeks.\n\nAlternatively, if we think of it in terms of multiplication, since 2 weeks per book times 6 books equals 12 weeks: 2 * 6 = 12. But again, that's not one of the options.\n\nSo, based on the given options, option C is the correct expression to find the total number of books Ty will read.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
