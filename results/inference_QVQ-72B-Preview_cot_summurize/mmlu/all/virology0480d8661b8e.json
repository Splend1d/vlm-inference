                    "text": "So I have this question here about HIV-1, which is supposed to be the most widespread and important retrovirus. The options are:\n\nA. Infecting only gay people\n\nB. Infecting only males\n\nC. Infecting every country in the world\n\nD. Infecting only females\n\nAnd I need to pick which one is true. Okay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that HIV-1 is a virus that causes AIDS, and it's a retrovirus, which means it can insert its genetic material into the DNA of infected cells. It primarily attacks the immune system, specifically the CD4+ T cells, which are crucial for fighting infections.\n\nNow, option A says it infects only gay people. That can't be right. While HIV was first recognized in the gay male population in the 1980s, it's not exclusive to any one group or orientation. It can be transmitted through unprotected sex, sharing contaminated needles, or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding.\n\nOption B says it infects only males. That's also not accurate. HIV can infect both males and females. In fact, it's a global pandemic that affects people of all genders, ages, and backgrounds.\n\nOption D says it infects only females. That's equally incorrect for the same reasons. HIV doesn't discriminate based on gender.\n\nOption C says it infects every country in the world. Hmm, that seems plausible. HIV/AIDS is a global health crisis that has spread to almost every corner of the earth. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 2020, about 37.7 million people were living with HIV globally, and the epidemic has been reported in all countries.\n\nBut wait, does that mean every single country has reported HIV cases? I should double-check that. Sometimes, data collection can be incomplete, especially in countries with limited healthcare resources or where stigma and discrimination are high.\n\nLet me recall: the first cases of AIDS were reported in the United States in 1981, and since then, the virus has spread worldwide. Programs like UNAIDS (Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS) work with countries to monitor and report HIV prevalence and incidence.\n\nI think it's safe to say that HIV has been detected in every country, but perhaps not every single person in those countries is infected. However, the way the question is phrased\u2014\u201cinfecting every country in the world\u201d\u2014suggests that the virus has spread to all nations, which is likely true given its global reach.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there are any countries where HIV hasn't been reported at all. Maybe some remote islands or isolated communities? But even then, with global travel and interconnectedness, it's hard to imagine any place remaining entirely unaffected.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider that while HIV is present in almost every country, the prevalence rates vary widely. For example, sub-Saharan Africa has been hit particularly hard by the epidemic, while other regions have lower rates.\n\nGiven all this, I still believe that option C is the correct answer because HIV has indeed spread to every country in the world, even if the prevalence differs from one place to another.\n\nJust to make sure, let's quickly dismiss the other options again:\n\nA is incorrect because HIV can infect people regardless of their sexual orientation.\n\nB is incorrect because it can infect both males and females.\n\nD is incorrect for the same reason as B.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C: infecting every country in the world.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
