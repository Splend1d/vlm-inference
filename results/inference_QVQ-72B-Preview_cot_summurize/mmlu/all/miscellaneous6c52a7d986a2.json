                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to figure out which former Beatle both Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson have recorded duets with. The options are Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, or Ringo Starr.\n\nFirst, I should recall if any of these artists have collaborated with the former Beatles. Starting with Stevie Wonder: I know he's a legendary musician and has worked with many people, but I don't immediately recall him having a duet with any of the Beatles.\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think about Stevie Wonder's discography. I know he's done some collaborations, but I'm not sure about duets specifically with the former Beatles.\n\nNow, moving on to Michael Jackson. He was incredibly famous and also worked with several artists. I recall that he and Paul McCartney did a song together. Was it \"Say Say Say\"? Yeah, I think that's right. So, Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney did a duet.\n\nBut what about Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney? Did they ever do a duet? I know they both are hugely influential in music, but I'm not sure if they've actually recorded a duet together.\n\nLet me consider John Lennon. He passed away relatively young, so maybe he didn't have many collaborations after the Beatles disbanded. I don't remember any duets with Stevie Wonder or Michael Jackson.\n\nWhat about George Harrison? He was another member of the Beatles. I know he did some solo work and collaborations, but again, I don't recall any duets with Stevie Wonder or Michael Jackson.\n\nThen there's Ringo Starr. He also had a solo career and collaborations, but I'm not sure about duets with these artists.\n\nWait a minute, maybe none of them have recorded duets with both Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson. But that can't be, because the question is asking which one has, and it's multiple choice with the four Beatles members.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I should look up the discographies of Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson to see if they have any collaborations with the former Beatles.\n\nStarting with Stevie Wonder:\n\n- I know he's had many hits over the years.\n\n- Some of his famous collaborations include \"Ebony and Ivory\" with Paul McCartney.\n\nWait, is that right? I think \"Ebony and Ivory\" is a song by Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder. Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, \"Ebony and Ivory\" is a song written and performed by Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder. So, that's a collaboration between Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney.\n\nNow, Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney:\n\n- They did \"Say Say Say,\" which is another famous collaboration.\n\nSo, both Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson have recorded songs with Paul McCartney.\n\nLet me check if there are any other collaborations between these artists and the other Beatles members.\n\nFor Stevie Wonder:\n\n- Besides Paul McCartney, did he work with John Lennon, George Harrison, or Ringo Starr?\n\nI don't think so. I can't recall any songs where Stevie Wonder and John Lennon, George Harrison, or Ringo Starr collaborated on a duet.\n\nSimilarly, for Michael Jackson:\n\n- He worked with Paul McCartney on \"Say Say Say\" and another song called \"The Girl Is Mine.\"\n\n- Did he work with any other Beatles members? I don't think so. John Lennon passed away before Michael Jackson's peak collaboration years, and I don't recall any collaborations with George Harrison or Ringo Starr.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Paul McCartney, since both Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson have recorded duets with him.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check my knowledge.\n\n- Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney: \"Ebony and Ivory\"\n\n- Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney: \"Say Say Say\" and \"The Girl Is Mine\"\n\nThese are well-known collaborations, so I'm confident that Paul McCartney is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Paul McCartney}} \\]"
