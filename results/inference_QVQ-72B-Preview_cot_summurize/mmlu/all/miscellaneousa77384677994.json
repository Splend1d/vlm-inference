                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"What literary work is the source of the quote 'Abandon every hope all you who enter here'?\" And the options are A. Paradise Lost, B. The Wizard of Oz, C. The Divine Comedy, D. Beowulf. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these works contains that famous quote.\n\nFirst off, I recognize that the quote is \"Abandon every hope all you who enter here.\" It sounds familiar, like something you'd see at the entrance of a place where hope has no place. Maybe a dungeon or some sort of underworld. Let me think about that.\n\nOption A is \"Paradise Lost.\" I remember that's an epic poem by John Milton about the fall of Satan and the temptation of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. It's a pretty significant work in English literature, but I don't recall any part of it mentioning abandoning hope at the entrance. Maybe not there.\n\nOption B is \"The Wizard of Oz.\" That's a classic story about a young girl named Dorothy who gets swept away to a magical land and has to find her way back home. It's filled with memorable characters like the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion. But again, I don't think there's a direct reference to abandoning hope at the entrance in this story. Maybe not here either.\n\nOption C is \"The Divine Comedy.\" I know this is an epic poem by the Italian poet Dante Alighieri. It's divided into three parts: Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso, describing Dante's journey through hell, purgatory, and heaven. Now, that sounds promising because Inferno is about hell, which is often associated with hopelessness.\n\nIn fact, I think there's a famous line from Dante's Inferno that goes something like \"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.\" Let me see if I can recall it properly. I think it's written on the gate of hell in the poem. Yes, that rings a bell. So, this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOption D is \"Beowulf.\" That's an Old English epic poem about the hero Beowulf, who battles monsters and dragons. It's a tale of bravery and valor. While it's an important work in literature, I don't remember any specific reference to abandoning hope at the entrance to any place within the story. So, probably not there.\n\nLet me double-check my memory about \"The Divine Comedy.\" In Inferno, when Dante and Virgil approach the gates of hell, there's an inscription on the gate that reads, \"Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch'intrate,\" which translates to \"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.\" Yes, that's the one! So, the quote in question is from Dante's Inferno, which is part of \"The Divine Comedy.\"\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll make sure there isn't a similar quote in any of the other works. In \"Paradise Lost,\" Milton focuses on the rebellion of Satan and the temptation of Adam and Eve. While there are themes of loss and despair, there isn't a direct phrase like \"abandon every hope\" at any threshold.\n\nIn \"The Wizard of Oz,\" the entry points are more about wonder and magic, like entering Oz itself or the Emerald City, but nothing about abandoning hope. It's a more lighthearted story, so that fits.\n\nAs for \"Beowulf,\" the settings involve halls like Heorot and the depths where Grendel lives, but again, no similar inscriptions or phrases about abandoning hope upon entry.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. The Divine Comedy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
