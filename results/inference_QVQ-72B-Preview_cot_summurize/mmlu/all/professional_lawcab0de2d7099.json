                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have a student who decides to buy a car because commuting via bus is taking too much time. He finds a car he likes, but he only has $2,500, and the car costs $10,000. Since he doesn't have a credit history, the car dealership is hesitant to sell it to him. That's when his father steps in and tells the finance manager, \"If you sell the car to my son and for any reason he defaults on the payments, I will pay the balance due.\"\n\nBased on this promise, the finance manager approves the deal. The terms are that the son pays $2,500 down and then $500 per month for 15 months. Everything seems fine until six months later, when the son defaults on the payment plan. At that point, the car lot goes straight to the father to recover the remaining balance without first suing the son.\n\nNow, the question is about the father's obligation under his promise. We need to determine whether the court would most likely:\n\nA. Relieve the father of liability, because the car lot failed to first sue the son.\n\nB. Relieve the father of liability, because the father was never under a duty as a surety.\n\nC. Not relieve the father of liability, because of the main purpose exception.\n\nD. Not relieve the father of liability, because parents are responsible for the debts of their children.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, we need to understand the nature of the father's promise. He said that if the son defaults, he (the father) will pay the balance due. This sounds like a guarantee or suretyship.\n\nIn contract law, a surety is someone who agrees to be responsible for another person's debt or obligation. So, in this case, the father is acting as a surety for his son's car loan.\n\nNow, generally, for a surety to be enforceable, there are certain requirements. One of them is that the surety must be aware that they are taking on this responsibility and that their obligation is secondary to the primary obligor, which is the son in this case.\n\nBut wait, there's a concept called \"main purpose\" suretyship, where the surety's primary purpose in entering into the agreement is to secure their own interest, not just to benefit the creditor.\n\nLet me think about this. The father is guaranteeing his son's debt. Is this a typical suretyship, or does the main purpose exception apply here?\n\nThe main purpose exception generally applies when the surety is primarily benefiting themselves by entering into the agreement, perhaps because they are receiving some direct benefit from the transaction.\n\nIn this scenario, the father is helping his son buy a car, which might indirectly benefit him since his son can now get to college faster, but it's not clear if that's the main purpose.\n\nMaybe the father wants his son to have a car for convenience or other reasons, but it's not evident that the father is directly benefiting from the transaction in a way that would make the main purpose exception applicable.\n\nSo, perhaps option C, \"not relieve the father of liability because of the main purpose exception,\" might not be the right choice.\n\nOption D says that parents are responsible for the debts of their children. Well, generally, parents are not automatically responsible for their adult children's debts unless there's a specific contract or law that says so. Since the son is presumably an adult (he's in college), it's unlikely that the father would be automatically responsible for his debts.\n\nTherefore, option D seems incorrect.\n\nOption B says that the father was never under a duty as a surety. But the father did make a promise to pay if the son defaults, which is the definition of a surety.\n\nHowever, in suretyship, there are rules about how the creditor must proceed. For example, the creditor might be required to exhaust all remedies against the primary obligor before seeking payment from the surety.\n\nIn this case, the car lot went straight to the father without first suing the son. So, perhaps there's an issue there.\n\nOption A suggests that the father should be relieved of liability because the car lot didn't first sue the son. This might be relevant if there's a requirement that the creditor first pursue the primary obligor before going after the surety.\n\nIn suretyship law, there's a concept called \"exhaustion of remedies,\" which means that the creditor must first try to collect from the primary obligor before turning to the surety.\n\nIf that's the case here, then perhaps the car lot should have first tried to collect from the son before going to the father.\n\nBut, on the other hand, the father explicitly promised to pay if the son defaults, without any condition that the car lot had to sue the son first.\n\nSo, if the father's promise was unconditional in that sense, maybe the car lot doesn't need to exhaust remedies against the son first.\n\nHowever, in practice, suretyship agreements often require that the creditor first pursue the primary obligor.\n\nBut in this scenario, the father's promise was straightforward: if the son defaults, he will pay the balance due.\n\nHe didn't specify that the car lot had to sue the son first or anything like that.\n\nSo, perhaps the father's promise is absolute, and the car lot can go straight to him without first suing the son.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a legal presumption that the creditor must first pursue the primary obligor unless the surety agreement says otherwise.\n\nI need to recall some suretyship law here.\n\nIn general suretyship, the surety has the right to require the creditor to first exhaust the primary obligor's assets or pursue other remedies before seeking payment from the surety.\n\nThis is known as the \"exhaustion rule\" or \"exhaustion of remedies.\"\n\nSo, unless the surety agreement specifically waives this right, the creditor must first attempt to collect from the primary obligor.\n\nIn this case, the father's promise didn't include any waiver of that right.\n\nTherefore, the car lot should have first tried to collect from the son before going to the father.\n\nSince they didn't do that, perhaps the father can be relieved of liability.\n\nBut wait, option A says that the court would relieve the father of liability because the car lot failed to first sue the son.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if failing to sue is the exact requirement.\n\nMaybe the car lot just needs to make a demand on the son or take some action to collect from him before going to the father.\n\nSuing might be one way to do that, but perhaps not the only way.\n\nMoreover, in some jurisdictions, the creditor must prove that the primary obligor is unable to pay before turning to the surety.\n\nBut this varies depending on the specific terms of the surety agreement and applicable law.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the father's promise was absolute, and the car lot can directly seek payment from him without first suing the son.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the father's promise was more like a guarantee, where he's only liable if the son doesn't pay.\n\nIn that case, the car lot would need to establish that the son has defaulted and that they've taken steps to collect from him before turning to the father.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nSuppose the father's promise is a guarantee. In that case, the car lot would typically need to first pursue the son for payment and establish that the son has defaulted before they can enforce the guarantee against the father.\n\nIf they haven't done that, then the father might not be liable.\n\nBut in this problem, it says that the son defaulted on the payment plan six months later, and the car lot sought recovery from the father without first suing the son.\n\nSo, perhaps the car lot has already established that the son has defaulted, but they haven't sued the son yet.\n\nDepending on the jurisdiction, the creditor might need to obtain a judgment against the primary obligor before enforcing the guarantee against the surety.\n\nIf that's the case, then the father could be relieved of liability because the car lot didn't first sue the son.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the father's promise was unconditional, and the car lot can go straight to him without any prerequisites.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as sureties generally have some protections.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option A is the most plausible answer.\n\nThe court would most likely relieve the father of liability because the car lot failed to first sue the son.\n\nThis aligns with suretyship principles that require the creditor to first pursue the primary obligor before turning to the surety.\n\nOptions B and D don't seem to align with the facts or the law, and option C is based on the main purpose exception, which doesn't seem to apply here.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
