                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of the following is evidence of a complex society? A. monumental works, B. burials with grave goods, C. leisure and a sedentary lifestyle, D. all of the above.\" Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let's think about what constitutes a complex society first.\n\nI remember from my history class that a complex society usually refers to a society with a high degree of social stratification, specialized labor, and centralized authority. So, it's not just any group of people, but one that has developed various institutions and structures to organize and govern itself.\n\nOption A is \"monumental works.\" I think of things like pyramids, temples, or large public buildings. Building something on that scale would require a lot of organization, planning, and labor division. Not to mention, it suggests that there's some kind of leadership capable of mobilizing resources and people for such projects. So, that sounds like it points to a complex society.\n\nOption B is \"burials with grave goods.\" This one seems interesting. Grave goods are items placed in tombs or graves, often believed to be useful in the afterlife. The presence of grave goods might indicate beliefs in an afterlife, which could be a sign of a society with developed religious or cultural practices. Moreover, the variation in grave goods could suggest social inequality\u2014some people get buried with more or better items than others. That would imply social stratification, which is a characteristic of complex societies.\n\nOption C is \"leisure and a sedentary lifestyle.\" Leisure suggests that not everyone has to be constantly working just to survive. There's time for activities beyond basic subsistence, like art, sports, or scholarly pursuits. A sedentary lifestyle means people don't move around much; they live in permanent or semi-permanent settlements. This often requires a stable food source, like agriculture, which in turn can support larger populations and more specialized roles. So, if people have leisure time and live in one place, that suggests a certain level of economic and social organization.\n\nNow, the question is whether all of these are evidence of a complex society, or if only some are. Let's consider each one individually again to make sure.\n\nStarting with A: monumental works. Definitely a sign of organized labor and leadership, which are key aspects of complex societies. Check.\n\nB: burials with grave goods. This suggests social stratification and developed cultural practices, both of which are indicative of complex societies. Check.\n\nC: leisure and a sedentary lifestyle. This implies a surplus of resources, specialized roles, and possibly a larger population, all of which are characteristics of complex societies. Check.\n\nSo, each of these three options, on their own, seems to be evidence of a complex society. Therefore, the answer should be D: all of the above.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about whether there could be exceptions or if one of these might not necessarily indicate a complex society.\n\nFor example, could monumental works exist without a truly complex society? Maybe in some cases, but it's hard to imagine organizing the labor and resources needed for large-scale construction without some level of social organization and leadership.\n\nWhat about burials with grave goods? Could that happen in a simpler society? Well, some indigenous cultures have burial practices that include grave goods, but often, these societies still have some level of social hierarchy or cultural complexity.\n\nSimilarly, a sedentary lifestyle and leisure time seem to require a certain level of economic stability and social structure to support them.\n\nI think, overall, that all three of these are indicative of a complex society. So, the correct answer is D: all of the above.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
