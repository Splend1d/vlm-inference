                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about Sartre and existentialism. It says, \"According to Sartre, what existentialists have in common is that they think that _____.\" And the options are:\n\nA. Essence precedes existence\n\nB. Objectivity must be a starting point\n\nC. Existence is a myth\n\nD. Existence precedes essence\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall what Sartre believed about existentialism. I remember that Sartre was a key figure in existentialist philosophy, especially known for his ideas about existence and freedom.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Essence precedes existence.\n\nHmm, I think this is actually the opposite of what Sartre believed. In his view, existence comes before essence. So, if essence precedes existence, that would be more in line with traditional metaphysics, where things have an essence or nature that defines them before they come into being. But Sartre argued against that, saying that people first exist and then define their essence through their choices and actions. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B: Objectivity must be a starting point.\n\nI know that Sartre was critical of traditional notions of objectivity and subjectivity. He emphasized the primacy of consciousness and subjective experience. In his famous work \"Being and Nothingness,\" he delves into the subjective nature of reality. So, suggesting that objectivity must be a starting point doesn't align with his thought. He thought that consciousness is fundamental, and our subjective experiences shape our understanding of the world. Therefore, this option probably isn't correct.\n\nOption C: Existence is a myth.\n\nThis one sounds intriguing but I don't think it's accurate. Sartre was deeply concerned with the reality of human existence and the individual's responsibility for their own choices. He famously said, \"Existence precedes essence,\" which emphasizes that we exist first and then define ourselves through our choices. So, he didn't consider existence a myth; rather, he thought it was paramount and that essence flows from existence, not the other way around.\n\nOption D: Existence precedes essence.\n\nAh, this rings a bell. This is a central tenet of Sartre's existentialism. He argued that for humans, existence comes before essence. In other words, we are born, we exist, and through our choices and actions, we define who we are and what our essence is. This is in contrast to other beings, like a chair or a rock, which have a predefined essence or purpose before they come into existence.\n\nTo double-check, I recall that Sartre made a distinction between \"being-in-itself\" (like objects) and \"being-for-itself\" (human consciousness). Humans are being-for-itself, characterized by consciousness and the ability to reflect upon and choose their actions, thereby defining their essence.\n\nSo, according to Sartre, what existentialists have in common is the belief that existence precedes essence. That is, we exist first and then define ourselves through our choices and actions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option D: Existence precedes essence.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other aspect of Sartre's philosophy that might be more fitting. For example, he was known for his ideas on radical freedom and existential angst, but the question specifically asks about what existentialists have in common according to Sartre.\n\nI think the most straightforward and accurate answer is indeed Option D. Existence precedes essence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
