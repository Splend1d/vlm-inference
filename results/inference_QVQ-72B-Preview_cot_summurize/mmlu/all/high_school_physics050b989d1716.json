                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about electric charges and spheres. Let's see what it's asking. There's a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge, +Q, and it's brought close to a neutral conducting sphere that's the same size. I need to figure out which statement is true from the options given.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the properties of conductors and nonconductors in an electric field. A conductor allows charge to move freely, so if there's an electric field present, charges in a conductor will rearrange themselves to cancel out the electric field inside the conductor. On the other hand, a nonconductor doesn't allow charges to move freely, so any charge placed on it will stay put.\n\nIn this scenario, we have a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q. When it's brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, what happens?\n\nOption A says that an electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere. Hmm, I thought that in a conductor, any electric field is supposed to be zero because the charges rearrange to cancel it out. But maybe the presence of the charged nonconducting sphere creates an electric field that induces charges on the conducting sphere.\n\nWait, but if the conducting sphere is neutral initially and it's brought close to a positively charged nonconducting sphere, the positive charge on the nonconducting sphere should attract negative charges in the conducting sphere to move closer to it, right? So, the conducting sphere would have negative charges on the side facing the nonconducting sphere and positive charges on the opposite side.\n\nBut does this induce an electric field within the conductor? I thought that inside a conductor, the electric field is zero in electrostatic equilibrium. Maybe the induced charges create their own electric field that cancels out the external electric field from the nonconducting sphere, resulting in no net electric field inside the conductor.\n\nBut the option says \"an electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.\" If my understanding is correct, then this might not be true because in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside a conductor should be zero.\n\nLet me think about option B: \"The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of \u2013Q.\" Wait, the conducting sphere is initially neutral, and it's being induced by the +Q charge nearby. Induction can transfer charge, but in this case, since both spheres are separate, I don't think charge is being transferred across the space between them. Instead, the charges in the conducting sphere are just rearranging themselves.\n\nSo, the conducting sphere remains electrically neutral overall; it's just that the negative charges are being pulled towards the side facing the positively charged nonconducting sphere, and the positive charges are being left on the opposite side. So, it's polarized, but its net charge should still be zero. Therefore, option B seems incorrect.\n\nNow, option C: \"The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.\" Given that one is positively charged and the other is neutral but being polarized by the positive charge, yes, there should be an attractive force between them. The positive charge attracts the induced negative charges on the conducting sphere, and the induced positive charges on the far side are repelled less strongly by the positive charge, so overall, there's a net attraction.\n\nWait, is that right? Yes, in electrostatics, when you bring a charged object close to a neutral conductor, the induced charges lead to an attractive force between the objects.\n\nOption D: \"The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.\" This seems contrary to what I just thought. Since one is positively charged and the other is being induced with negative charges on the facing side, they should attract each other, not repel.\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, option C seems correct, while option D is incorrect.\n\nLet me double-check. In electrostatic induction, when a charged object is brought near a neutral conductor, the conductor gets polarized, with opposite charges induced on the near side and like charges on the far side. The net force between the charged object and the conductor is attractive because the induced charges on the near side are closer and have a stronger interaction.\n\nMoreover, the net charge on the conductor remains zero; only redistribution of charges occurs.\n\nAs for option A, if there's an electric field inside the conductor, that would suggest that the conductor isn't in electrostatic equilibrium, which shouldn't be the case. So, I think option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B claims the conductor develops a net charge of \u2013Q, but since it's neutral and no charge is being transferred, it should still be neutral overall.\n\nTherefore, the correct option should be C: The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of repulsion. If both spheres were positively charged, they would repel each other, but in this case, one is positively charged and the other is neutral and being polarized, so attraction seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the electric field lines start on positive charges and end on negative charges. The positive charge on the nonconducting sphere creates an electric field that induces negative charges on the conducting sphere, and the field lines would be directed from the positive charge to the induced negative charges, indicating attraction.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I'm confident that option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
