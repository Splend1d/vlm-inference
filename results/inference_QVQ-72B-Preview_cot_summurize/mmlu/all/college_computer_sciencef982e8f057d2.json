                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we're talking about multiprogrammed systems, where multiple users can share programs like editors and compilers. The question is asking which of the given options must be true for a single copy of a program to be shared by several users. The options are:\n\nI. The program is a macro.\n\nII. The program is recursive.\n\nIII. The program is reentrant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means in the context of programming and operating systems.\n\nStarting with macros: in programming, a macro is a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain piece of code should be transformed or expanded. It's like a shortcut that gets replaced with a larger block of code during compilation. So, a macro isn't a program in itself but a way to abstract and reuse code.\n\nRecursive programs are those that call themselves repeatedly, breaking down a problem into smaller and smaller subproblems until they reach a base case. Recursion is a way of solving problems, but it doesn't directly relate to whether a program can be shared by multiple users in a multiprogrammed system.\n\nReentrancy is a property of a program or routine that allows it to be interrupted and then resumed, even while it's being executed by another task or user. This is crucial in multiprogramming environments because it means that multiple users can access the same program simultaneously without interfering with each other's data or execution.\n\nGiven these definitions, let's think about which of these properties are necessary for a single copy of a program to be shared by several users in a multiprogrammed system.\n\nIf a program is reentrant, it means that it can be safely executed by multiple users at the same time because it doesn't modify its code or data in ways that would cause conflicts between different executions. This is essential for sharing a single copy of the program among multiple users.\n\nOn the other hand, being a macro or being recursive doesn't directly contribute to the shareability of the program in this context. Macros are more about code expansion and abstraction, not about concurrent execution. Recursion is a problem-solving technique and doesn't affect the program's ability to be shared in a multiprogramming environment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. III only.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there's any scenario where being a macro or being recursive could influence the program's shareability.\n\nIf a program is a macro, it's essentially a text replacement and doesn't involve actual program execution. So, sharing a macro among multiple users would involve sharing the definition, but the execution would still be independent for each user. It doesn't inherently enable or require the sharing of a single copy in a multiprogramming sense.\n\nAs for recursion, it's possible to have recursive programs that are also reentrant, but recursion isn't a prerequisite for reentrancy. In fact, many reentrant programs are not recursive, and many recursive programs are not reentrant unless designed carefully.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the key property for a program to be shareable by multiple users in a multiprogrammed system is that it must be reentrant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
