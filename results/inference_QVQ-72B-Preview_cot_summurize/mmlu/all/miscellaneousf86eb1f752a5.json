                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Who wrote musicals with Oscar Hammerstein II?\" and there are four options to choose from. The options are A. Richard Rodgers, B. Rogers Hornsby, C. Gilbert O'Sullivan, and D. George Rogers Clark. I need to figure out which one of these collaborated with Oscar Hammerstein II on musicals.\n\nFirst off, I know that Oscar Hammerstein II was a famous lyricist and dramatist in the world of musical theater. He was really prominent in the 20th century, especially known for his work with composer Richard Rodgers. Wait, is that right? I think they were a famous duo, like Rodgers and Hammerstein, who wrote many popular musicals together.\n\nLet me think about that. Some of their famous musicals include \"Oklahoma!,\" \"Carousel,\" \"South Pacific,\" \"The King and I,\" and \"The Sound of Music.\" Yeah, that sounds familiar. So, Richard Rodgers was the composer, and Oscar Hammerstein II was the lyricist in that partnership.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Richard Rodgers \u2013 That seems to be the correct answer based on what I just recalled.\n\nB. Rogers Hornsby \u2013 I know Rogers Hornsby was a baseball player, mostly known for his batting skills. He was active in the early 20th century, mainly with the St. Louis Cardinals and the Chicago Cubs. I don't recall him being involved in musical theater or collaborating with Hammerstein.\n\nC. Gilbert O'Sullivan \u2013 I recognize this name as a singer-songwriter from the 1970s. He had hits like \"Alone Again (Naturally)\" and \"Clair.\" He's more associated with pop music rather than musical theater.\n\nD. George Rogers Clark \u2013 This name rings a bell from history class. He was an American Revolutionary War general, known for his role in the Northwest Indian War. Definitely not a collaborator in musical theater.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems pretty clear that Richard Rodgers is the correct answer. But just to be thorough, I should double-check.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possibility that one of the other options could be correct. For instance, maybe Oscar Hammerstein II collaborated with someone else on lesser-known musicals or projects. But from what I know, his most famous and prolific collaboration was with Richard Rodgers.\n\nI should also consider the time periods. Oscar Hammerstein II was active from the 1920s through the 1960s, and Richard Rodgers was active around the same time. Rogers Hornsby was primarily active in the 1910s and 1920s in baseball, which might overlap slightly, but I don't see a connection to musical theater.\n\nGilbert O'Sullivan rose to fame in the 1970s, which is after Oscar Hammerstein II's death in 1960, so collaboration there seems unlikely. George Rogers Clark was active in the late 18th century, so that's definitely not matching up.\n\nTherefore, the only logical choice is Richard Rodgers. To confirm, I can recall that Rodgers and Hammerstein were a celebrated team in musical theater, known for their innovative and groundbreaking works.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll think about some of their specific collaborations. For example, \"Oklahoma!\" premiered in 1943, and \"The Sound of Music\" in 1959. Both were massive successes and are still popular today. No other name on the list has a similar association with Hammerstein's musicals.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is A. Richard Rodgers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Richard Rodgers}} \\]"
