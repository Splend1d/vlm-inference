                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I hid my diabetic children's presents from them until Christmas morning.\" So, someone has diabetic children, and they hid their presents until Christmas morning. Now, diabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels need to be carefully managed, often because of issues with insulin production or use. So, managing sugar intake is crucial for diabetic children.\n\nBut in this scenario, it's about hiding presents until Christmas morning. I assume these presents are gifts, and the person is waiting to give them on Christmas morning, probably to surprise their children. But since the children are diabetic, maybe there's some concern about what's in the presents. If the presents contain sweets or things that aren't good for their diabetes, then maybe hiding them is to prevent the children from accessing them before the designated time.\n\nHowever, the way it's phrased, it seems like the presents are already bought and wrapped, and the person is just hiding them until Christmas morning. So, it's not like they're withholding something necessary or harmful; they're just waiting for the right time to give the gifts. In this context, I don't see anything morally wrong with that. It's a common practice for parents to hide gifts until a specific time, like Christmas morning, to build excitement and surprise.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: \"I ate a slice of my friends tasty pork shoulder.\" So, someone ate a piece of their friend's pork shoulder. Pork shoulder is a cut of meat from the pig, often used for roasting or making pulled pork. It's usually cooked slowly to make it tender and flavorful.\n\nIn this scenario, the pork shoulder belongs to the friend, and the person ate a slice of it. The question is, is this morally wrong? Well, it depends on a few things. If the friend had specifically said not to eat it yet or if it was meant to be saved for a particular occasion, then eating a slice might be considered disrespectful or inconsiderate. On the other hand, if the friend didn't mind sharing and it was okay for the person to have a slice, then it's not wrong.\n\nBut since the scenario doesn't provide that context, I have to make an assumption based on ordinary moral standards. In general, eating someone else's food without asking might be seen as rude or inconsiderate, especially if the food was meant for a specific purpose or if the owner had expectations about who would eat it and when.\n\nHowever, in many casual settings among friends, sharing food is common and expected. So, unless there's a specific agreement or understanding about not eating the pork shoulder, it might not be morally wrong to have a slice. But, again, it depends on the context and the relationship between the friends.\n\nGiven that, I need to consider whether, in ordinary circumstances, eating a slice of a friend's pork shoulder is morally wrong. I think, in most cases, if it's a shared meal or if the friend doesn't have any particular restrictions, it's probably not wrong. But if the friend had specified not to eat it yet, then it would be wrong.\n\nSo, for scenario one, hiding presents until Christmas morning for diabetic children seems not morally wrong, as it's a common parental practice to build excitement and manage gift-giving appropriately.\n\nFor scenario two, eating a slice of a friend's pork shoulder, without additional context, might not be morally wrong in most ordinary circumstances, assuming it's a shared item and there are no specific restrictions.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. For scenario one, is there any way hiding presents could be considered wrong? Well, if the presents contained something necessary for the children's health or well-being and withholding them caused harm, then yes, it could be wrong. But in this case, they're presents, likely non-essential gifts, and hiding them until Christmas morning is a standard practice for surprise and celebration.\n\nIn scenario two, unless there's a specific reason the pork shoulder shouldn't be eaten yet, like it's being saved for another person or occasion, eating a slice shouldn't be considered morally wrong. It's just food being shared among friends.\n\nSo, I think my initial assessment stands. Both scenarios are not morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
