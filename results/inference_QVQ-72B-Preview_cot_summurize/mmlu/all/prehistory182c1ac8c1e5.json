                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which subfield of anthropology has been described as studying 'other people's garbage'?\" And the options are A. primatology, B. archaeology, C. paleoanthropology, D. linguistics. Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out which one of these is all about looking at other people's garbage.\n\nFirst off, I know that anthropology is a big field that studies humans and their cultures, past and present. It has several subfields, and I recognize most of these options as parts of anthropology. Let me think about each one.\n\nPrimatology sounds like it's about primates, right? Like monkeys and apes. So, that's studying living primates, their behavior, society, and ecology. But the question mentions \"other people's garbage,\" which makes me think more about human remains or artifacts, not necessarily those of other primates. Maybe primatologists study the remains of ancient primates, but I'm not sure. Maybe not the primary focus.\n\nArchaeology\u2014that rings a bell with studying ancient civilizations and their artifacts. Archaeologists dig up things like tools, pottery, and other objects that people left behind. Wait, that sounds a lot like studying garbage, in a way. I mean, a lot of what archaeologists find are things that people discarded or left behind when they moved away. So, maybe archaeology is the answer.\n\nPaleoanthropology\u2014I know this is about early humans and human ancestors. It involves studying fossils and ancient remains to understand human evolution. So, while it does involve looking at remains, it's more focused on the biological aspects and the evolution of humans, not necessarily on the artifacts or material culture that people left behind. Maybe not as closely related to \"garbage\" as archaeology.\n\nLinguistics\u2014that's the study of language. It deals with how languages are structured, how they develop over time, and how people use them. While language is a part of culture, which anthropology studies, linguistics is more focused on the linguistic aspects rather than material remains or artifacts.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about this differently. The phrase \"other people's garbage\" is probably a metaphorical way of referring to material remains that people have left behind. In other words, it's about studying the physical objects that past human societies have created and discarded.\n\nSo, considering that, archaeology seems like the most fitting choice. Archaeologists specifically study material remains from past human cultures to understand how people lived, what their societies were like, and how they interacted with their environment.\n\nLet me double-check. Primatology is about non-human primates, paleoanthropology is about human evolution through fossils, and linguistics is about language. None of these directly focus on material remains from past human societies in the same way that archaeology does.\n\nMoreover, archaeologists often refer to the things they find as \"artifacts,\" which can include everything from tools and weapons to pottery and jewelry. These items are essentially the remnants of daily life that have been left behind, much like garbage.\n\nIn fact, some modern archaeologists even study contemporary garbage to understand current consumption patterns and social behaviors. So, this further reinforces the idea that archaeology is the subfield that studies \"other people's garbage.\"\n\nI think I've got it. The answer should be B. archaeology.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
