                    "text": "So I have this question about lactose, and I need to pick which statement is correct. Let's see what the options are.\n\nOption A says that lactose is always the cause of milk intolerance. Hmm, I thought that lactose intolerance is a thing, but not everyone who can't drink milk has lactose intolerance. Maybe some people have an allergy to casein, which is a protein in milk. So, maybe it's not always lactose that causes milk intolerance. Maybe A is not correct.\n\nOption B says that lactose cannot be digested in the human gut. Well, lactose is a sugar found in milk, and normally, our bodies produce an enzyme called lactase that breaks down lactose into glucose and galactose, which can be digested. But some people have lactose intolerance because they don't produce enough lactase, so lactose passes through their gut undigested, causing discomfort. So, in general, lactose can be digested in the human gut, but some people can't digest it properly. Maybe B is incorrect.\n\nOption C says that lactose intolerance is present in up to 20% of the population. I've heard that lactose intolerance is pretty common, especially in certain ethnic groups like Asians and Africans. In fact, I think the percentage might be higher than 20% globally. For example, in some Asian countries, over 90% of adults are lactose intolerant. So, saying up to 20% seems a bit low. Maybe C is not the right answer.\n\nOption D says that lactose is excluded on a low FODMAP diet. I've heard of the low FODMAP diet; it's supposed to help people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by reducing certain carbohydrates that are hard to digest. FODMAP stands for Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols. Lactose is a disaccharide, which is a type of sugar that can be problematic for some people. I think lactose is one of the FODMAPs, so it should be restricted or avoided on a low FODMAP diet. That makes sense.\n\nLet me double-check. FODMAPs include various types of carbohydrates like fructose, lactose, fructans, galacto-oligosaccharides, and polyols. Yes, lactose is included in the FODMAP category. So, on a low FODMAP diet, lactose is indeed excluded or limited.\n\nSo, based on this, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let's quickly recap:\n\n- Option A: Lactose is not always the cause of milk intolerance; some people may have milk protein allergies.\n\n- Option B: Lactose can be digested in the human gut by those who produce lactase; only those who are lactose intolerant cannot digest it properly.\n\n- Option C: Lactose intolerance is more common than 20% in many populations, so up to 20% is an underestimation.\n\n- Option D: Lactose is indeed excluded on a low FODMAP diet because it is a FODMAP.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. Is excluded on a low FODMAP diet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
