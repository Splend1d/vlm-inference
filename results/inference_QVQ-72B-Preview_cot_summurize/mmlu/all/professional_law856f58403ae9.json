                    "text": "So I've got this property law scenario here, and I need to figure out which statement accurately reflects the law regarding the mobile home restriction in this subdivision. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, a developer buys a 100-acre tract in 1995 and creates a subdivision plan with 100 one-acre residential lots. This plan is recorded in 1996. Then, over the next few years, the developer sells 60 of these lots to individual buyers. Each of these deeds includes a clause saying that no house trailer or mobile home shall be built or maintained on any lot within the subdivision.\n\nIn 2002, the developer sells the remaining 40 lots to a builder, and the deed for these lots also includes the same mobile home restriction. By 2007, the builder sells all 40 of these lots, but interestingly, the deeds for these sales don't include the mobile home provision. Instead, they just identify each lot as part of the subdivision without mentioning the restriction.\n\nNow, in January 2008, a man who bought one of these lots from the builder puts a mobile home on his property. Another lot owner in the subdivision sues him to make him remove the mobile home. The question is, which of the given statements accurately reflects the law in this situation?\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. There is no enforceable restriction because the mobile-home provision did not \"run with the land.\"\n\nB. There is no enforceable restriction because the man's deed did not include the mobile-home provision.\n\nC. The mobile-home restriction would be enforceable because a common development scheme had been established for the entire subdivision.\n\nD. The outcome turns on whether a common development scheme had been organized for the entire subdivision.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what it means for a restriction to \"run with the land.\" In property law, a covenant or restriction \"runs with the land\" if it binds not only the original parties but also subsequent owners of the property. For a restriction to run with the land, there usually needs to be privity of estate, meaning there has to be a direct relationship between the parties, or it has to be a covenant touching the land that benefits or burdens the land.\n\nIn this case, the original restriction was included in the deeds of the first 60 lots sold by the developer, and then in the 40 lots sold to the builder. However, when the builder sold the 40 lots, the restriction wasn't included in those deeds. So, for the lots sold by the builder, the restriction isn't explicitly in their deeds.\n\nOption A suggests that there's no enforceable restriction because the provision didn't \"run with the land.\" But wait, the restriction was included in the original deeds, so perhaps it was intended to run with the land for all lots in the subdivision. Maybe it's a restrictive covenant that applies to the entire subdivision.\n\nOption B says there's no restriction because the man's deed didn't include the provision. That's true for his specific deed, but maybe the restriction applies to the entire subdivision based on the original plan and the recorded subdivision plan.\n\nOption C claims that the restriction is enforceable because a common development scheme was established for the entire subdivision. A common development scheme, or a general plan of development, can create restrictions that apply to all lots in the subdivision, even if individual deeds don't include the restrictions. This is because all lots are subject to the same restrictions as part of the overall plan.\n\nOption D says that the outcome depends on whether a common development scheme was organized for the entire subdivision. So, it's suggesting that the key issue is whether such a scheme exists.\n\nI think the crucial point here is whether a common development scheme was established for the entire subdivision. If it was, then the restriction would apply to all lots, regardless of whether it was included in individual deeds. So, even if the builder's deeds didn't include the restriction, the restriction would still bind the lots because of the overall subdivision plan.\n\nLooking back at the facts, the developer prepared a subdivision plan in 1995, which was recorded in 1996. This plan created 100 one-acre residential lots. The restriction against mobile homes was included in the deeds of the first 60 lots sold by the developer and in the 40 lots sold to the builder. However, when the builder sold the 40 lots, their deeds didn't include the restriction, but they did identify the lots as part of the subdivision.\n\nThe fact that the subdivision plan was recorded suggests that there might be a general plan or scheme that imposes uniform restrictions on all lots in the subdivision. Recorded subdivision plans often include coven, conditions, and restrictions (CC&Rs) that apply to all lots.\n\nSo, if a common development scheme exists, the restriction would apply to all lots in the subdivision, including those sold by the builder without the specific restriction in their deeds.\n\nTherefore, I think option C is correct: the mobile-home restriction would be enforceable because a common development scheme had been established for the entire subdivision.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's more to this.\n\nFirst, for a common development scheme to exist, there needs to be evidence of a general plan to impose uniform restrictions on all lots in the subdivision. In this case, the developer created a subdivision plan with 100 lots, recorded it, and included a restriction in the first 60 deeds. When the builder bought the remaining 40 lots, the restriction was included in their deed, suggesting continuity in the restriction.\n\nHowever, when the builder sold the 40 lots, the restriction wasn't included in those deeds. Does that mean the restriction doesn't apply to those lots, or does the common development scheme still bind them?\n\nGenerally, in property law, if a subdivision is subject to a recorded declaration of restrictions or if there's a homeowners' association with CC&Rs, those restrictions bind all lots in the subdivision, even if individual deeds don't repeat them.\n\nBut in this scenario, it's not clear whether there was a recorded declaration or CC&Rs beyond the subdivision plan itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the restriction is part of the subdivision plan, and since all lots are part of the subdivision, the restriction applies to all lots.\n\nAnother angle: equitable servitudes. If the restriction is an equitable servitude, it can bind subsequent owners if it meets certain criteria, such as being intended to benefit the land and being recorded.\n\nIn this case, the restriction was included in the original deeds and the subdivision plan was recorded, which might be sufficient to create an enforceable equitable servitude for all lots in the subdivision.\n\nHowever, the fact that the builder's deeds didn't include the restriction might complicate things. Maybe the restriction only binds those lots whose deeds include it.\n\nBut that seems unfair and could lead to inconsistency within the subdivision, which is why courts often look for a general plan or scheme that imposes uniform restrictions.\n\nSo, I still think that option C is the most accurate statement of law here, assuming that a common development scheme exists.\n\nWait, but option D says that the outcome turns on whether a common development scheme had been organized for the entire subdivision. That seems similar to option C but phrased differently.\n\nOption C states definitively that the restriction is enforceable because of the common development scheme, while option D says that the outcome depends on whether such a scheme exists.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option D is also correct, in that the existence of a common development scheme is the determining factor.\n\nBut I need to choose the most accurate statement of law.\n\nI think option C is more direct and affirmative, stating that the restriction is enforceable based on the common development scheme, implying that such a scheme exists.\n\nOption D is more conditional, saying that the outcome turns on whether such a scheme exists, which it likely does, given the recorded subdivision plan and the developer's actions.\n\nSo, perhaps both C and D are correct in different ways, but since I have to choose one, I'll go with C, as it affirms that the restriction is enforceable based on the common development scheme.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the court would need to determine whether a common development scheme exists, making option D the more accurate statement of the legal issue at hand.\n\nBut I think, based on the information provided, it's reasonable to conclude that a common development scheme does exist, given the recorded subdivision plan and the developer's inclusion of the restriction in the first 60 deeds and the builder's deed.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement of law is option C: the mobile-home restriction would be enforceable because a common development scheme had been established for the entire subdivision.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
