The auditor lacks independence with respect to the entity.\n\nB. Management prevents the auditor from observing the entity's inventory.\n\nC. The entity omits the statement of cash flows from its financial statements.\n\nD. The auditor's report refers to the work of an actuary.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a qualified opinion is. I remember that an auditor's opinion on financial statements can be:\n\n- Unqualified (clean) opinion: everything is A-OK.\n\n- Qualified opinion: there's some limitation, but it's not so bad that it affects the overall picture.\n\n- Adverse opinion: the financial statements are so messed up that they don't fairly represent the entity's financial position.\n\n- Disclaimer of opinion: the auditor can't form an opinion because there's not enough information.\n\nSo, a qualified opinion is like a yellow flag\u2014it's not great, but it's better than a red flag or no flag at all.\n\nNow, the question is asking under which circumstance an auditor may NOT issue a qualified opinion. That means, in which of these situations would a qualified opinion be inappropriate, and the auditor should instead issue something else, like an adverse opinion or a disclaimer.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\n**Option A: The auditor lacks independence with respect to the entity.**\n\nIndependence is crucial for auditors. If the auditor isn't independent, meaning they have some conflict of interest or bias, that compromises their ability to provide an objective and unbiased opinion. I think in such a case, the auditor shouldn't issue any opinion at all, because their objectivity is in question. So, they probably shouldn't issue a qualified opinion; maybe they should withdraw from the engagement or issue a disclaimer.\n\n**Option B: Management prevents the auditor from observing the entity's inventory.**\n\nInventory is a significant asset for many companies, and observing the inventory count is an important audit procedure to verify its existence and condition. If management prevents the auditor from doing this, it's a big problem because the auditor can't get the necessary evidence to support the inventory balance. This is likely a scope limitation, and I think auditors would issue a qualified opinion or, if the issue is severe enough, a disclaimer of opinion. So, in this case, a qualified opinion might be acceptable, depending on the circumstances.\n\n**Option C: The entity omits the statement of cash flows from its financial statements.**\n\nGenerally, a complete set of financial statements includes the balance sheet, income statement, statement of retained earnings, and statement of cash flows. If the entity omits the statement of cash flows, that's an incomplete presentation. Auditors might issue a qualified opinion for incomplete presentations, but I need to check if there's a specific rule about this.\n\n**Option D: The auditor's report refers to the work of an actuary.**\n\nSometimes, auditors rely on the work of experts, like actuaries, to help them audit certain aspects, such as pension liabilities. When the auditor refers to the work of an actuary in their report, it's usually because they've evaluated the actuary's work and found it acceptable. So, in this case, it shouldn't prevent them from issuing a qualified opinion if necessary.\n\nBut maybe there's a specific rule about when an auditor can or cannot issue a qualified opinion in these scenarios.\n\nLet me think about the principles involved here.\n\nFirst, independence is fundamental. If the auditor isn't independent, the entire audit is compromised. So, in that case, they shouldn't be issuing any opinion, qualified or otherwise.\n\nFor scope limitations, like not being able to observe inventory, auditors typically issue a qualified opinion or a disclaimer, depending on the materiality of the issue.\n\nIf financial statements are incomplete, like missing the statement of cash flows, auditors might issue a qualified opinion for that reason.\n\nAnd referring to the work of an actuary in the audit report is standard practice when the auditor has relied on an expert's work, and it shouldn't prevent them from issuing a qualified opinion if other issues arise.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems like the one where the auditor shouldn't issue a qualified opinion because the independence issue goes to the core of the audit's integrity.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nI recall that according to auditing standards, if the auditor is not independent, they should either decline the engagement or issue a disclaimer of opinion, stating that they are not independent and therefore cannot express an opinion on the financial statements.\n\nSo, in that case, a qualified opinion wouldn't be appropriate because the independence issue affects the entire audit, not just a specific aspect of the financial statements.\n\nIn contrast, for options B, C, and D, the issues are more specific to certain aspects of the audit or the financial statements, so a qualified opinion might be appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A: when the auditor lacks independence with respect to the entity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
