It's asking about the phase that includes a bunch of research, identifying target audiences, proposing communication channels and strategies, and constructing goals, objectives, messages, and themes. The options are identification, evaluation, implementation, or planning. Hmm, let's see which one fits best.\n\nFirst, let's think about what each phase typically involves in a PR model. I know that the PR process usually has steps like research, planning, implementation, and evaluation. But the question seems to be referring to one specific phase, and it's giving details about what that phase entails.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Identification: This might involve recognizing problems or opportunities, but the description seems more involved than just identification.\n\nB. Evaluation: This is usually about measuring the success of the campaign after it's been implemented, but the description talks about planning and setting goals, which seems more upfront.\n\nC. Implementation: This is about executing the plan, but again, the description includes a lot of upfront strategic work.\n\nD. Planning: This sounds promising because it involves deciding on the approach, setting goals, identifying audiences, and choosing communication channels.\n\nGiven that, planning seems to align closely with the activities described in the question. Let me double-check.\n\nPrimary and secondary research is typically done in the planning phase to understand the current landscape, audience perceptions, and other relevant data. Identifying target audiences is also a key part of planning\u2014figuring out who you want to reach with your message.\n\nProposing channels of communication and strategies sounds like developing the tactical approach, which is part of planning. And constructing goals, objectives, messages, and themes is definitely part of the planning process.\n\nSo, based on this, planning seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any overlap or if another option could also fit. For example, implementation involves carrying out the plan, but the description here seems more about developing the plan rather than executing it.\n\nEvaluation is about assessing the effectiveness of the campaign, often using metrics and analytics, which doesn't match the description provided.\n\nIdentification might be part of the initial research, but it's not comprehensive enough to cover all the aspects mentioned in the question.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D. planning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
