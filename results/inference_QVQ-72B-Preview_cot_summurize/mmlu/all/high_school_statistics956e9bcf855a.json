                    "text": "So I have this problem here about finding the best interpretation of a 90% confidence interval for the average cost of running for a congressional seat. They've given me a sample of 50 politicians, with a mean cost of $125,000 and a standard deviation of $32,000. I need to choose the correct interpretation from the options provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a confidence interval is. A confidence interval gives me an estimated range of values which is likely to include an unknown population parameter, in this case, the average cost of running for a congressional seat. The 90% confidence level means that if I were to take many samples and construct intervals in the same way, about 90% of those intervals would contain the true population mean.\n\nSo, to find the confidence interval, I need to calculate the margin of error and add and subtract that from the sample mean. The formula for the margin of error is:\n\n\\[ \\text{margin of error} = z^* \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right) \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( z^* \\) is the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to the desired confidence level.\n\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the population standard deviation.\n\n- \\( n \\) is the sample size.\n\nIn this problem, the sample size \\( n = 50 \\), the sample mean is $125,000, and the sample standard deviation is $32,000. Since the sample size is large (over 30), I can use the z-distribution for the confidence interval.\n\nFor a 90% confidence interval, the critical value \\( z^* \\) is approximately 1.645.\n\nSo, let's calculate the standard error:\n\n\\[ \\text{standard error} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{32,000}{\\sqrt{50}} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the square root of 50:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{50} \\approx 7.071 \\]\n\nThen, divide $32,000 by 7.071:\n\n\\[ \\text{standard error} \\approx \\frac{32,000}{7.071} \\approx 4,525.58 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the margin of error:\n\n\\[ \\text{margin of error} = 1.645 \\times 4,525.58 \\approx 7,450.42 \\]\n\nFinally, the 90% confidence interval is:\n\n\\[ \\text{lower limit} = 125,000 - 7,450.42 \\approx 117,549.58 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{upper limit} = 125,000 + 7,450.42 \\approx 132,450.42 \\]\n\nSo, the confidence interval is approximately $117,550 to $132,450.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 90% of politicians running for a congressional seat spend between $117,500 and $132,500.\n\nB. 90% of politicians running for a congressional seat spend a mean dollar amount that is between $117,500 and $132,500.\n\nC. We are 90% confident that politicians running for a congressional seat spend between $117,500 and $132,500.\n\nD. We are 90% confident that politicians running for a congressional seat spend a mean dollar amount between $117,500 and $132,500.\n\nFirst, options A and C suggest that 90% of individual politicians spend within this range. But a confidence interval is about the population mean, not individual values. So, these options are misinterpreting the confidence interval.\n\nOption B mentions \"a mean dollar amount,\" which is closer to the correct interpretation, but it says \"90% of politicians,\" which still seems to suggest that 90% of the politicians have means in that range, which isn't accurate.\n\nOption D says, \"we are 90% confident that politicians running for a congressional seat spend a mean dollar amount between $117,500 and $132,500.\"\n\nThis seems to be stating that we are 90% confident that the true mean spending is within this interval. However, it's important to note that the confidence is in the method, not in the parameter itself being within the interval in a probabilistic sense.\n\nGiven that, option D seems to be the closest to the correct interpretation. It's expressing confidence in the interval estimate for the population mean.\n\nBut to make sure, let's recall that a confidence interval is about the uncertainty around the population parameter based on the sample data. So, we can say that with 90% confidence, the true mean falls within the calculated interval.\n\nTherefore, option D is the best interpretation.\n\nWait a minute, but option C says, \"we are 90% confident that politicians running for a congressional seat spend between $117,500 and $132,500.\" This seems similar but doesn't specify \"mean dollar amount.\" It might be interpreted as individual spending, which is incorrect.\n\nOption D specifies \"a mean dollar amount,\" which clarifies that it's about the mean spending, not individual spending.\n\nSo, option D is indeed the correct choice.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the wording of option B: \"90% of politicians running for a congressional seat spend a mean dollar amount that is between $117,500 and $132,500.\"\n\nThis seems confusing because it's mixing up the concept. It's not 90% of politicians having their means in that range; it's that we are confident about the range containing the true mean.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most accurate interpretation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
