                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"What is the English title for the divination text also known as the Yijing?\" And the options are A. The Classic of Documents, B. The Lotus Sutra, C. The Flower Garland Sutra, and D. The Classic of Changes. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these is also known as the Yijing.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Yijing is an ancient Chinese text used for divination. It's also sometimes referred to as the Book of Changes or the I Ching. So, I think the English title should reflect that idea of \"changes\" or \"transformations.\"\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. The Classic of Documents \u2013 That sounds like it might be about historical records or official papers. Doesn't seem to align with the concept of changes or divination.\n\nB. The Lotus Sutra \u2013 I recall that the Lotus Sutra is a Buddhist text. It's important in Mahayana Buddhism, and it's about the universal potential for enlightenment. Not related to the Yijing, which is more about predicting changes through hexagrams.\n\nC. The Flower Garland Sutra \u2013 Another Buddhist text, I believe. It's also known as the Avatamsaka Sutra and talks about the interdependence of all phenomena. Again, not directly related to divination or the Yijing.\n\nD. The Classic of Changes \u2013 This sounds promising. It seems to capture the idea of changes, which is central to the Yijing. The Yijing is indeed about understanding and interpreting changes in the world, using symbols and hexagrams to predict future events.\n\nLet me double-check. The Yijing is one of the Five Classics in Chinese literature, and it's primarily concerned with changes and transformations. It uses a system of sixty-four hexagrams to provide insights into various situations.\n\nOption D, The Classic of Changes, seems to be a direct translation of the Yijing's purpose. It focuses on changes, which matches the essence of the text.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I think the correct answer is D. The Classic of Changes.\n\nWait a minute, I should make sure that none of the other options are mistakenly associated with the Yijing. For instance, is there any connection between the Yijing and The Classic of Documents?\n\nNo, The Classic of Documents is a collection of ancient Chinese political documents and speeches. It's not related to divination, which is the primary function of the Yijing.\n\nWhat about The Lotus Sutra and The Flower Garland Sutra? These are both Buddhist scriptures, and the Yijing is a Chinese philosophical text predating Buddhism's arrival in China. So, they're from different cultural and religious backgrounds.\n\nTherefore, the only option that fits the description is D. The Classic of Changes.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can recall that in English, the Yijing is often referred to as the I Ching or the Book of Changes. The Classic of Changes seems to be another translation, emphasizing the theme of change, which is central to the text.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I'm confident that D. The Classic of Changes is the correct English title for the divination text also known as the Yijing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
