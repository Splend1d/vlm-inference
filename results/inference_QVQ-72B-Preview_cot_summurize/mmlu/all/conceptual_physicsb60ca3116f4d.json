                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question about gases: hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen at a certain temperature, and it's asking which ones have the fastest molecules on average. The options are hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, or all have the same average speed.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall some gas laws or properties that relate temperature to molecular speeds. I remember there's something called the root mean square speed (rms speed) formula for gases, which relates the average speed of gas molecules to temperature and molar mass.\n\nThe formula for rms speed is:\n\n\\[ v_{rms} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3RT}{M}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(R\\) is the ideal gas constant,\n\n- \\(T\\) is the absolute temperature in Kelvin,\n\n- \\(M\\) is the molar mass of the gas.\n\nFrom this formula, it seems that the rms speed is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. So, lighter gases should have higher average speeds at the same temperature.\n\nLet me list the molar masses:\n\n- Hydrogen (\\(H_2\\)): approximately 2 g/mol\n\n- Oxygen (\\(O_2\\)): approximately 32 g/mol\n\n- Nitrogen (\\(N_2\\)): approximately 28 g/mol\n\nSo, hydrogen has the lowest molar mass, followed by nitrogen and then oxygen.\n\nGiven that, according to the rms speed formula, hydrogen should have the highest average speed, and oxygen should have the lowest among these three.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's more to it.\n\nI also recall the concept of kinetic theory, which states that at a given temperature, all gas particles have the same average kinetic energy, regardless of their mass.\n\nThe kinetic energy (\\(KE\\)) is given by:\n\n\\[ KE = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2 \\]\n\nAnd for a mole of gas, the average kinetic energy per mole is:\n\n\\[ KE_{avg} = \\frac{3}{2} RT \\]\n\nSo, since temperature is the same for all gases, their average kinetic energies should be equal.\n\nTherefore, for equal kinetic energy, the relationship is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 = constant \\]\n\nMeaning that lighter particles can move faster to have the same kinetic energy as heavier particles.\n\nThis reinforces the earlier conclusion that hydrogen, being the lightest, has the highest average speed.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another perspective. Maybe the pressure plays a role here, but the question is about average speeds, not about pressure.\n\nAlso, perhaps the distribution of speeds matters. For instance, in a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the shape depends on temperature and molar mass. At a fixed temperature, lighter molecules have a broader distribution with a higher peak at higher speeds.\n\nSo, again, on average, hydrogen molecules are moving faster.\n\nIs there any other factor that could influence this? What about the degrees of freedom or molecular complexity? No, I don't think that affects the average speed in this context.\n\nLet me consider if there's any exception or special case that might change this general rule. For example, if the gases were not behaving ideally, but at typical temperatures and pressures, gases behave pretty ideally.\n\nMoreover, the question specifies \"at a given temperature,\" so we can assume standard conditions unless specified otherwise.\n\nAnother thing to consider: are these diatomic molecules? Yes, all three\u2014hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen\u2014are diatomic. But I don't think that affects their average speeds in this scenario.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the mass of individual atoms matters, but since they're all diatomic, their molar masses are effectively doubled compared to their atomic masses.\n\nBut I already accounted for that in the molar masses I listed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the root mean square speed isn't the only measure; maybe we should look at most probable speed or average speed based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.\n\nLet's recall that the average speed (\\(v_{avg}\\)) is given by:\n\n\\[ v_{avg} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8RT}{\\pi M}} \\]\n\nThis is similar to the rms speed, still inversely proportional to the square root of molar mass.\n\nSo, again, hydrogen should have the highest average speed.\n\nTo further confirm, perhaps I can calculate the rms speed for each gas at, say, 298 K.\n\nFirst, for hydrogen (\\(H_2\\), M = 2 g/mol):\n\n\\[ v_{rms} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3 \\times 8.314 \\, \\text{J/mol}\\cdot\\text{K} \\times 298 \\, \\text{K}}{0.002 \\, \\text{kg/mol}}} \\]\n\nWait, units need to be consistent. R is in J/mol\u00b7K, and M in kg/mol.\n\nSo, M for hydrogen is 0.002 kg/mol.\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\[ v_{rms} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3 \\times 8.314 \\times 298}{0.002}} \\]\n\nCalculating inside the square root:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3 \\times 8.314 \\times 298}{0.002} = \\frac{7239.768}{0.002} = 3619884 \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ v_{rms} = \\sqrt{3619884} \\approx 1899.97 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nOkay, approximately 1900 m/s.\n\nNow, for oxygen (\\(O_2\\), M = 32 g/mol or 0.032 kg/mol):\n\n\\[ v_{rms} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3 \\times 8.314 \\times 298}{0.032}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{3 \\times 8.314 \\times 298}{0.032} = \\frac{7239.768}{0.032} = 226242.75 \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2 \\]\n\n\\[ v_{rms} = \\sqrt{226242.75} \\approx 475.6 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nAnd for nitrogen (\\(N_2\\), M = 28 g/mol or 0.028 kg/mol):\n\n\\[ v_{rms} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3 \\times 8.314 \\times 298}{0.028}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{3 \\times 8.314 \\times 298}{0.028} = \\frac{7239.768}{0.028} = 258563.14 \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2 \\]\n\n\\[ v_{rms} = \\sqrt{258563.14} \\approx 508.5 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nSo, indeed, hydrogen has the highest rms speed, followed by nitrogen and then oxygen.\n\nThis calculation solidifies the earlier conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the average speed formula:\n\n\\[ v_{avg} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8RT}{\\pi M}} \\]\n\nThe relationship remains the same, as it's also inversely proportional to the square root of molar mass.\n\nTherefore, hydrogen should have the highest average speed.\n\nWait, but in the calculation above, for rms speed, hydrogen is higher than nitrogen and oxygen, which aligns with the inverse square root of molar mass relationship.\n\nIs there any scenario where this wouldn't hold true? For example, at very high temperatures or under extreme pressures, but the question specifies \"at a given temperature,\" so assuming standard conditions, this should hold.\n\nMoreover, if the gases were not ideal, there might be some deviations, but for the purposes of this question, we can assume ideal behavior.\n\nAnother angle to consider: perhaps the degrees of freedom affect the average speed, but in the kinetic theory, at a given temperature, the average kinetic energy per particle is the same, regardless of the number of degrees of freedom.\n\nTherefore, the average speed depends only on temperature and molar mass.\n\nAdditionally, maybe thinking about the particle sizes could be relevant, but in the kinetic molecular theory, particle sizes are negligible compared to the distances between them, especially under standard conditions.\n\nThus, it's safe to conclude that hydrogen molecules have the highest average speed among hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen at a given temperature.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. hydrogen.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ hydrogen}} \\]"
