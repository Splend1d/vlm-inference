                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two office locations for a company: one in New Jersey and one in Utah. The mean salary for office assistants in New Jersey is $28,500, and in Utah, it's $22,500. There are 128 office assistants in New Jersey and 32 in Utah. We need to find the overall mean salary for all office assistants in the company.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a mean salary is. It's the total salary paid to all employees divided by the number of employees. So, if I can find the total salary paid in both offices and then divide by the total number of office assistants, I should get the overall mean salary.\n\nLet's start by finding the total salary paid in each office.\n\nFor the New Jersey office:\n\nMean salary = $28,500\n\nNumber of office assistants = 128\n\nTotal salary in New Jersey = mean salary \u00d7 number of employees\n\n= $28,500 \u00d7 128\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n28,500 \u00d7 128\n\nI can break it down:\n\n28,500 \u00d7 100 = 28,500,000\n\n28,500 \u00d7 20 = 570,000\n\n28,500 \u00d7 8 = 228,000\n\nAdding them up: 28,500,000 + 570,000 = 29,070,000\n\n29,070,000 + 228,000 = 29,298,000\n\nSo, total salary in New Jersey is $29,298,000.\n\nNow, for the Utah office:\n\nMean salary = $22,500\n\nNumber of office assistants = 32\n\nTotal salary in Utah = mean salary \u00d7 number of employees\n\n= $22,500 \u00d7 32\n\nCalculating that:\n\n22,500 \u00d7 30 = 675,000\n\n22,500 \u00d7 2 = 45,000\n\nAdding them up: 675,000 + 45,000 = 720,000\n\nSo, total salary in Utah is $720,000.\n\nNow, to find the total salary paid by the company, I need to add the total salaries from both offices:\n\n$29,298,000 (New Jersey) + $720,000 (Utah) = $30,018,000.\n\nNext, I need to find the total number of office assistants in the company:\n\n128 (New Jersey) + 32 (Utah) = 160.\n\nFinally, the overall mean salary is the total salary divided by the total number of employees:\n\nMean salary = total salary / total number of employees\n\n= $30,018,000 / 160\n\nNow, let's calculate that:\n\n30,018,000 \u00f7 160.\n\nThis might be easier if I divide 30,018 by 1.6:\n\n30,018 \u00f7 1.6 = 18,761.25\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 1.6 times 18,761.25 should give 30,018.\n\nLet me check:\n\n1.6 \u00d7 18,761.25 = 1.0 \u00d7 18,761.25 = 18,761.25\n\n0.6 \u00d7 18,761.25 = 11,256.75\n\nAdding up: 18,761.25 + 11,256.75 = 30,018.\n\nOkay, that checks out.\n\nSo, the overall mean salary is $18,761.25.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because the mean salaries in both offices are higher than that. New Jersey has $28,500 and Utah has $22,500, and the overall mean should be somewhere between these two, closer to New Jersey since it has more employees.\n\nI must have made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me re-examine.\n\nFirst, total salary in New Jersey:\n\n28,500 \u00d7 128.\n\nLet's calculate that again:\n\n28,500 \u00d7 100 = 2,850,000\n\n28,500 \u00d7 20 = 570,000\n\n28,500 \u00d7 8 = 228,000\n\nAdding them up: 2,850,000 + 570,000 = 3,420,000\n\n3,420,000 + 228,000 = 3,648,000\n\nWait, earlier I mistakenly wrote $29,298,000, which was incorrect. It should be $3,648,000.\n\nSo, total salary in New Jersey is $3,648,000.\n\nTotal salary in Utah is $720,000.\n\nTotal salary for the company is $3,648,000 + $720,000 = $4,368,000.\n\nTotal number of office assistants is 128 + 32 = 160.\n\nOverall mean salary = $4,368,000 / 160.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n4,368,000 \u00f7 160.\n\nI can simplify this by dividing numerator and denominator by 16:\n\n4,368,000 \u00f7 16 = 273,000\n\n160 \u00f7 16 = 10\n\nSo, it simplifies to 273,000 \u00f7 10 = $27,300.\n\nThat makes more sense, as it's between $22,500 and $28,500.\n\nWait, but let's double-check to make sure I didn't make another mistake.\n\nTotal salary in New Jersey: 28,500 \u00d7 128.\n\n28,500 \u00d7 100 = 2,850,000\n\n28,500 \u00d7 20 = 570,000\n\n28,500 \u00d7 8 = 228,000\n\nAdding them: 2,850,000 + 570,000 = 3,420,000 + 228,000 = 3,648,000. That seems correct.\n\nTotal salary in Utah: 22,500 \u00d7 32.\n\n22,500 \u00d7 30 = 675,000\n\n22,500 \u00d7 2 = 45,000\n\nAdding them: 675,000 + 45,000 = 720,000. Correct.\n\nTotal salary: 3,648,000 + 720,000 = 4,368,000.\n\nTotal employees: 128 + 32 = 160.\n\nMean salary: 4,368,000 \u00f7 160.\n\nLet me calculate that again:\n\n4,368,000 \u00f7 100 = 43,680\n\n43,680 \u00f7 1.6 = 27,300.\n\nYes, $27,300.\n\nAlternatively, I can use weighted averages.\n\nThe mean salary in New Jersey is $28,500 with 128 employees.\n\nThe mean salary in Utah is $22,500 with 32 employees.\n\nThe overall mean can be calculated as:\n\n[ (New Jersey mean \u00d7 New Jersey employees) + (Utah mean \u00d7 Utah employees) ] / total employees\n\n= [ (28,500 \u00d7 128) + (22,500 \u00d7 32) ] / 160\n\nWhich is the same calculation I did earlier, leading to $27,300.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be $27,300, which corresponds to option D.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
