                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about protein synthesis, and there are four options. I need to pick the correct one. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember.\n\nOption A says that all the information in DNA codes for proteins. Hmm, I don't think that's right. I recall that DNA carries information for making proteins, but not all DNA sequences code for proteins. There are non-coding regions too, right? Like introns and regulatory sequences. So, maybe this isn't correct.\n\nOption B says that the mRNA formed by transcription of a region of DNA only contains information for the protein to be synthesized. Wait, I thought that mRNA carries the genetic code from DNA to the ribosomes, where proteins are made. But does it only contain information for the protein? What about other elements? Maybe there's more to it.\n\nOption C says that both strands of DNA are transcribed to form mRNA. I remember that in DNA, only one strand is typically used as the template for transcription. The other strand is the coding strand. So, I think this is incorrect. It's usually only one strand that's transcribed.\n\nOption D says that the RNA formed by transcription of DNA undergoes splicing and further modifications to form mRNA. This sounds familiar. I think that immediately after transcription, RNA is precursor mRNA or pre-mRNA, which is processed before becoming mature mRNA. This processing includes splicing out introns and adding caps and tails. So, this seems correct.\n\nLet me double-check. In eukaryotes, mRNA undergoes splicing to remove introns and keep exons, and there are modifications like adding a 5' cap and a poly-A tail. Prokaryotes might not have splicing, but they still have modifications. So, generally, RNA does undergo processing after transcription to become mRNA.\n\nI think the correct answer is D. The RNA formed by transcription of DNA undergoes splicing and further modifications to form mRNA.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if any of the other options could be correct.\n\nA is incorrect because not all DNA codes for proteins; some DNA sequences have other functions.\n\nB might be tempting, but I think that mRNA does contain information beyond just the protein sequence, like signals for splicing and perhaps regulatory elements.\n\nC is incorrect because typically only one strand of DNA is transcribed into mRNA.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
