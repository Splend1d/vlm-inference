                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about light refracting when it goes from one medium to another. It's asking which of these changes: speed only, wavelength only, both speed and wavelength, or neither of these. Hmm, I need to recall what happens when light refracts.\n\nI remember that refraction is when light bends as it passes from one medium to another, like from air to water or from water to glass. This bending happens because the speed of light changes when it enters a different medium.\n\nSo, first off, I know that the speed of light does change when it refracts. In vacuum, light travels at about 300,000 kilometers per second, but in other media, like water or glass, it's slower. So, speed definitely changes.\n\nNow, about the wavelength. I think there's a relationship between the speed, frequency, and wavelength of light. There's a formula: velocity = frequency \u00d7 wavelength, right? So, v = f \u00d7 \u03bb.\n\nIf the speed changes and the frequency stays the same, then the wavelength must change too. Wait, does the frequency stay the same? I think so. When light goes from one medium to another, its frequency doesn't change, but its wavelength does.\n\nLet me double-check that. Imagine a wave approaching a boundary between two media. The frequency is the number of waves passing a point per second, and it's determined by the source of the light. So, unless something changes at the source, the frequency should remain constant.\n\nTherefore, if the speed changes when light enters a different medium, and frequency stays the same, then wavelength must change to satisfy the equation v = f \u00d7 \u03bb.\n\nSo, both speed and wavelength change during refraction.\n\nWait a minute, but sometimes I hear about cases where only the speed changes, and the wavelength stays the same. Is that possible?\n\nNo, I don't think so. From what I recall, both speed and wavelength change during refraction, but frequency remains constant.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose light is going from air to water. In air, the speed is very close to the speed in vacuum, and in water, it's slower. So, speed decreases. If speed decreases and frequency stays the same, then wavelength must decrease as well.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in this case, both speed and wavelength decrease.\n\nWhat about going from water to glass? Glass has a higher refractive index than water, so light slows down even more. Again, speed decreases, and wavelength decreases.\n\nWhat if light goes from a medium with a higher refractive index to one with a lower refractive index? Like from glass to air. In this case, the speed increases as it enters air, and wavelength increases as well, while frequency remains constant.\n\nSo, in all these cases, both speed and wavelength change.\n\nIs there any scenario where only one of them changes? I can't think of any right now.\n\nMaybe if light reflects off a surface, but that's not refraction; that's reflection. The question is specifically about refraction.\n\nSo, in refraction, both speed and wavelength change, while frequency remains constant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Both speed and wavelength.\n\nBut let's make sure. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nI recall that the index of refraction (n) is equal to the speed of light in vacuum (c) divided by the speed in the medium (v): n = c/v.\n\nAlso, the wavelength in the medium (\u03bb) is related to the wavelength in vacuum (\u03bb\u2080) by \u03bb = \u03bb\u2080/n.\n\nSo, if n changes, both v and \u03bb change.\n\nTherefore, in refraction, both speed and wavelength change.\n\nI think I'm confident with that answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the equation for the refractive index:\n\nn = c / v\n\nAnd\n\nn = \u03bb\u2080 / \u03bb\n\nSo, if n changes, both v and \u03bb must change.\n\nHence, the answer is C. Both speed and wavelength.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
