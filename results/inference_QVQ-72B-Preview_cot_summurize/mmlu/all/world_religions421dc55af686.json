                    "text": " So I have this question about Hindu festivals. It says that the festival involves decorating the house with lights, setting off firecrackers, and wearing new clothes. And the options are A. Deepavali, B. Holi, C. Diwali, and D. Navaratri. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these festivals matches the description.\n\nFirst off, I know that Hinduism has several important festivals, each with their own traditions and celebrations. Let's think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with A. Deepavali. I've heard of Diwali, but Deepavali sounds similar. Maybe they are the same festival with different names? I should check that.\n\nThen there's B. Holi, which I know is the festival of colors. People throw colored powder and water at each other, celebrating the arrival of spring. But I don't remember if it involves decorating houses with lights or setting off firecrackers. Maybe not as much as some other festivals.\n\nOption C is Diwali, which I'm more familiar with. It's known as the festival of lights, where people do decorate their homes with lights, and I think firecrackers are also a part of the celebration. Wearing new clothes is also a tradition during Diwali. So, this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nLastly, D. Navaratri. I know this is a festival that lasts for nine nights, each dedicated to a different avatar of the goddess Durga. It's more about worship and performances like Garba dances, especially in some regions. I don't recall lighting decorations or firecrackers being a major part of this festival, but I might be wrong.\n\nNow, the confusion is between Deepavali and Diwali. I think they might be the same festival with different names. Maybe Deepavali is another name for Diwali in certain regions or languages in India.\n\nLet me do a quick search to confirm that. Oh, yes! Deepavali and Diwali are indeed the same festival. Deepavali is another name for Diwali, which is celebrated as the festival of lights. So, options A and C are essentially the same thing.\n\nThat makes it easier. So, between Deepavali/Diwali and Holi and Navaratri, the description of decorating houses with lights, setting off firecrackers, and wearing new clothes fits Diwali/Deepavali the best.\n\nHoli is more about colors and water fights, and Navaratri is focused on worship and dancing. So, while they might have some similar elements, the core traditions differ.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Deepavali or C. Diwali, since they are the same festival.\n\nWait a minute, but the question lists them as separate options. Maybe the person who wrote the question wasn't aware that Deepavali and Diwali are the same festival. Or perhaps in some contexts, they are considered different, but I don't think so.\n\nIn standard usage, Deepavali and Diwali refer to the same festival of lights in Hinduism. So, if I had to choose between A and C, I'd pick either one because they are the same.\n\nBut since the question might be expecting a single answer, perhaps I should go with the more commonly used name, which is Diwali.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some regions, Deepavali and Diwali have slight variations, but in general, they are the same celebration.\n\nTo be thorough, I'll check again. Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is indeed the festival of lights, where people light diyas (oil lamps), decorate their homes, wear new clothes, and sometimes set off firecrackers to celebrate.\n\nHoli, on the other hand, is the festival of colors, where people throw colored powders and water at each other, and it's less about lights and firecrackers.\n\nNavaratri is a festival dedicated to the goddess Durga, involving nine nights of worship and dancing, particularly in Gujarat and other parts of India. While there might be some lighting involved, it's not primarily known for the extensive use of lights and firecrackers like Diwali.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer to the question is Diwali, which is option C.\n\nBut since option A, Deepavali, is also a name for the same festival, it's equally correct. However, if I had to choose one, I'd go with C. Diwali, as it's more widely recognized by that name.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Diwali}} \\]"
