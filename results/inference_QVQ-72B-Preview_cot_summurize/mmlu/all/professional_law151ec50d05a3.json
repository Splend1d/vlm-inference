                    "text": "So I've got this property law problem here, and I need to figure out who owns the land based on a series of events involving joint tenancy, mortgages, and a will. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, a brother and sister bought a piece of land for $50,000, with the sister paying $10,000 and the brother paying $40,000. They took title as joint tenants with right of survivorship. Joint tenancy means that both own the property equally, and if one dies, the other automatically gets the whole thing, right? But wait, they didn't pay equal amounts. Does that matter?\n\nI recall that in joint tenancy, each tenant owns an undivided interest in the whole property, regardless of how much they contributed financially. So, even though the brother paid $40,000 and the sister $10,000, they each own a 50% interest in the property. However, if they decide to sell or something, the contribution might affect how they split the proceeds, but that's not directly relevant here.\n\nNext, the sister mortgaged her interest in the land. So, she probably took out a loan and used her half of the property as collateral. But she later paid off that mortgage, and it was released. So, presumably, any lien on her interest is no longer there.\n\nThen, the brother died, and he left his entire estate to a cousin. Since they were joint tenants with right of survivorship, does that mean the sister automatically gets his share, or does his will override that?\n\nI think the general rule is that the right of survivorship trumps the will. So, even if the brother wanted to leave his share to the cousin, the fact that they were joint tenants means that the sister should get his share upon his death. Is that correct?\n\nBut let's think about it carefully. Maybe there are exceptions or specific laws in this jurisdiction that could change that. The problem mentions that common law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute in the jurisdiction. So, probably, the standard rules apply.\n\nAssuming that, the sister should now own the entire property by right of survivorship upon the brother's death. But wait, the brother died testate, leaving everything to a cousin. Might there be some conflict there?\n\nI think in most jurisdictions, a joint tenancy with right of survivorship will pass outside of the will, meaning the survivor gets the property regardless of what the will says. So, the cousin wouldn't get the brother's share of the property.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any way the cousin could claim an interest in the property. Maybe if the brother severed the joint tenancy before he died, but there's no mention of that. So, probably not.\n\nAlso, the sister mortgaged her interest, but she paid it off and the mortgage was released. So, that shouldn't affect the ownership now. Unless there's something I'm missing there.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about whether the mortgage affected the brother's interest indirectly. But no, she only mortgaged her interest, so it shouldn't impact the brother's share.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the unequal contributions affect the joint tenancy. Like, could the brother argue that since he paid more, he should have a larger share? But in a joint tenancy, it's typically equal undivided interests regardless of contribution, unless there's an agreement saying otherwise.\n\nUnless there's a specific agreement that the shares should be proportional to their contributions, it should remain a 50-50 ownership.\n\nSo, putting it all together, after the brother's death, the sister should own the entire property by right of survivorship, and the cousin wouldn't get anything from the will regarding the property.\n\nBut let's see what the options are:\n\nA. The answer depends on whether the jurisdiction follows the lien theory or the title theory of mortgages.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure about that. The lien theory and title theory mainly deal with how mortgages are treated in terms of property ownership and foreclosure. But since the mortgage has been paid off and released, I don't think that's relevant here.\n\nB. Title is entirely in the sister as the surviving joint tenant.\n\nThis seems plausible based on the right of survivorship.\n\nC. Title is in the sister and the cousin as equal tenants in common.\n\nBut why would the cousin have a share? As I thought, the survivorship right should pass the brother's share to the sister, not to the cousin.\n\nD. Title is in the sister and the cousin as tenants in common, with the sister having a 20% interest and the cousin having an 80% interest.\n\nThis seems even less likely. Why would their interests be split 20-80? The brother and sister were equal owners in joint tenancy, and the brother's will shouldn't affect that since survivorship should override the will.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the sister owns the land entirely as the surviving joint tenant. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nIf the brother had severed the joint tenancy before he died, then maybe his share could have passed via his will to the cousin. But there's no mention of that. So, the joint tenancy remained intact until his death, and thus the sister gets his share.\n\nAlso, the fact that the sister mortgaged her interest and then paid it off shouldn't affect the ownership now.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is B. Title is entirely in the sister as the surviving joint tenant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
