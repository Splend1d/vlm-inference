                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about moral wrongs, and it's asking which of two scenarios involves doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems like there might be a bit of confusion in how the question is phrased, but I'll try to make sense of it.\n\nFirst, let's look at the scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I encouraged my friend to see the doctor for her back pain.\n\nScenario 2: I told her it was safe to jump off the cliff.\n\nSo, the question is asking which of these actions is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet me think about Scenario 1. Encouraging a friend to see a doctor for back pain. Back pain can be a serious issue, and seeing a doctor is generally a responsible and caring thing to do. So, encouraging someone to seek medical help when they might need it seems like the right thing to do. It shows concern for their well-being and is aligned with promoting health and safety. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this wouldn't be considered wrong. In fact, it's often seen as helpful and supportive behavior.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: Telling a friend that it's safe to jump off a cliff. This seems a lot more problematic. Jumping off a cliff is generally not safe, unless you're a trained base jumper with proper equipment or something like that, which is highly unlikely. For most people, jumping off a cliff would result in serious injury or death. So, telling someone it's safe to do something that is inherently dangerous and likely to cause harm is not morally right. It could be seen as reckless advice that endangers someone's life or well-being. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards, this would be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven that Scenario 1 is not wrong and Scenario 2 is wrong, the correct choice should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the way the question is phrased, it says \"For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong...\" and then lists the options as A, B, C, D. But the options seem to be paired in a way that might be confusing.\n\nOption A: Wrong, Wrong \u2013 meaning both scenarios are wrong.\n\nOption B: Wrong, Not wrong \u2013 meaning Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nOption C: Not wrong, Wrong \u2013 meaning Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nOption D: Not wrong, Not wrong \u2013 meaning neither scenario is wrong.\n\nGiven this, and my earlier conclusion that Scenario 1 is not wrong and Scenario 2 is wrong, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing here. Is there any possibility that encouraging someone to see a doctor could be considered morally wrong in some contexts? Well, perhaps if the person didn't need to see a doctor and the encouragement caused unnecessary worry or expense, but in general, encouraging someone to seek medical help is considered a positive action.\n\nOn the other hand, telling someone it's safe to jump off a cliff is clearly irresponsible and could lead to harm, so it's definitely wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nI think that's the correct assessment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
