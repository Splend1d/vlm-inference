                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out what would happen if the son sues his friend for specific performance of a real estate contract. The friend is refusing to go through with the sale because he thinks the son can't convey a fee simple interest in the property. And the question mentions something called \"the Rule in Shelley's Case\" being followed in this jurisdiction. I need to see how that affects the outcome.\n\nFirst, let's break down the initial setup. The grantor conveys his property to his son \"for life, remainder after (the son's) death to his heirs.\" So, this is a life estate with a remainder to the son's heirs. The son has a life estate, which means he can use and enjoy the property during his lifetime, but upon his death, the property is supposed to go to his heirs.\n\nTwo years later, the son tries to sell the property to his friend, agreeing to convey the premises in fee simple absolute. But the friend backs out before settlement, claiming that the son can't convey a fee simple because of the remainder interest.\n\nNow, a fee simple absolute is the highest form of property ownership, giving the owner the right to use the property in any legal way, to transfer it, or to will it to heirs. So, the son is promising to transfer complete ownership to the friend.\n\nBut there's this remainder interest that passes to the son's heirs after his death. That complicates things because it means that the son doesn't have absolute ownership; there's a future interest that will vest in his heirs.\n\nThe question mentions \"the Rule in Shelley's Case.\" I remember that this is a doctrine in property law that affects the interpretation of certain types of future interests, particularly remainders. The rule essentially says that if a remainder is created in favor of a person and their heirs, and that person also holds a preceding life estate, then the remainder is void and the life tenant holds the property in fee simple.\n\nIn other words, the life tenant ends up with full ownership if the rule applies.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the grantor conveyed the property to the son \"for life, remainder after (the son's) death to his heirs.\" If the Rule in Shelley's Case applies, then the remainder to the son's heirs is void, and the son actually holds the property in fee simple absolute.\n\nTherefore, the son would be able to convey a fee simple interest to the friend, and the friend's concern would be misplaced.\n\nBut wait, the question says that the friend thinks the son can't convey a fee simple because of the remainder. If the Rule in Shelley's Case applies, then the remainder is void, and the son does have a fee simple, so the friend's concern is unfounded.\n\nSo, if the son sues for specific performance, he should succeed because he can convey what he promised, which is a fee simple absolute.\n\nBut let's look at the options:\n\nA. The son's not succeeding, because he could not convey marketable title.\n\nBut according to the Rule in Shelley's Case, he does have a fee simple, so this shouldn't be correct.\n\nB. The son's succeeding, because he had a fee simple to convey.\n\nThis seems right, based on the application of the rule.\n\nC. The son's not succeeding, because his heirs have to join in the transaction in order to convey marketable title.\n\nWait, if the rule applies, the remainder is void, so the heirs don't have any interest to convey. So, this option doesn't make sense.\n\nD. The son's succeeding, because the son's conveyance of his life estate to the friend divests the contingent remainder of his heirs.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit confusing. The conveyance of the life estate wouldn't necessarily divest a remainder interest unless certain conditions are met. But according to the rule, the remainder is already void, so this might not be relevant.\n\nSo, between options B and D, which one is correct?\n\nOption B says the son succeeds because he had a fee simple to convey, which aligns with the application of the Rule in Shelley's Case.\n\nOption D mentions that the son's conveyance divests the contingent remainder of his heirs. But if the rule applies, the remainder is already void, so there's nothing to divest.\n\nTherefore, option B seems more accurate.\n\nWait, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe the rule only applies if certain conditions are met, or perhaps there are exceptions.\n\nLet me double-check the Rule in Shelley's Case. It states that where a life estate is created in favor of a person, with a remainder to that same person and their heirs, the remainder is void, and the life tenant holds the property in fee simple.\n\nIn this case, the grantor conveyed the property to the son for life, with a remainder to his heirs. So, the life tenant is the son, and the remainder is to his heirs. According to the rule, this should make the son the absolute owner in fee simple.\n\nTherefore, the son can convey a fee simple absolute to the friend, and the friend's refusal is based on a misunderstanding.\n\nSo, in a suit for specific performance, the son should succeed, because he does have the power to convey the property as agreed.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B seems to be the correct one.\n\nOption D mentions that the son's conveyance divests the contingent remainder of his heirs. But since the remainder is already void under the rule, there's no remainder to divest in the first place.\n\nTherefore, option B is the best answer.\n\nSo, the outcome would be that the son succeeds in his suit for specific performance because he had a fee simple to convey.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
