We need to find the exponent of 109 in the prime factorization of \\(x^{11}\\).\n\nFirst, since 107 and 109 are primes, the prime factorization of \\(x\\) is simply \\(x = 107 \\times 109^5\\). That means, in the prime factorization, the exponent of 107 is 1 and the exponent of 109 is 5.\n\nNow, we need to find \\(x^{11}\\). To do that, we can use the property of exponents that states \\((a \\times b)^n = a^n \\times b^n\\). So, applying this to \\(x^{11}\\):\n\n\\[\nx^{11} = (107 \\times 109^5)^{11} = 107^{11} \\times (109^5)^{11}\n\\]\n\nNext, we simplify \\((109^5)^{11}\\) using the power of a power rule, which says \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\times n}\\). Therefore:\n\n\\[\n(109^5)^{11} = 109^{5 \\times 11} = 109^{55}\n\\]\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n\\[\nx^{11} = 107^{11} \\times 109^{55}\n\\]\n\nNow, we're asked for the exponent of 109 in the prime factorization of \\(x^{11}\\). From the above expression, it's clear that the exponent is 55.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 9\n\nB. 55\n\nC. 21\n\nD. 11\n\nIt seems like the correct answer is option B. 55.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to approach this or perhaps there's a trick I'm missing. Let's think again.\n\nWe know that \\(x = 107 \\times 109^5\\). So, the prime factors of \\(x\\) are 107 and 109, with exponents 1 and 5, respectively.\n\nWhen we raise \\(x\\) to the 11th power, each prime exponent gets multiplied by 11. So, the exponent of 107 in \\(x^{11}\\) would be \\(1 \\times 11 = 11\\), and the exponent of 109 would be \\(5 \\times 11 = 55\\).\n\nThis matches our earlier result. Alternatively, if we consider that the exponents add when multiplying primes, but in this case, since 107 and 109 are distinct primes, their exponents don't interact with each other in the factorization of \\(x^{11}\\).\n\nTherefore, the exponent of 109 in the prime factorization of \\(x^{11}\\) is indeed 55.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. 55.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 55} \\]"
