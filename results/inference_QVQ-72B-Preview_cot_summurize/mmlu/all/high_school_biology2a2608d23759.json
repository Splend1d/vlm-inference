Robert MacArthur and E. O. Wilson\n\nB. James Watson and Francis Crick\n\nC. Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann\n\nD. Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what island biogeography is. From what I remember in ecology classes, island biogeography is a field that studies the distribution and diversity of species on islands. It looks at factors like the size of the island, its distance from the mainland, and how these influence the number of species that can live there.\n\nSo, who are the scientists that came up with this theory?\n\nLet me think about option A: Robert MacArthur and E. O. Wilson. I recall that E. O. Wilson is a famous biologist who worked on ecology and evolution, especially on islands. Robert MacArthur was also an ecologist. I think they collaborated on some work related to islands and species diversity.\n\nOption B: James Watson and Francis Crick. They are famous for discovering the structure of DNA, right? That's more about molecular biology and genetics, not really about ecology or island biogeography.\n\nOption C: Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann. I believe they were involved in formulating the cell theory, which states that all living things are made up of cells. Again, that's more of a foundational concept in biology, not specifically about ecology or islands.\n\nOption D: Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase. They are known for the Hershey-Chase experiment, which helped prove that DNA is the genetic material. Another contribution to genetics, but not directly related to ecology or island biogeography.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option A, Robert MacArthur and E. O. Wilson, is the correct answer. But just to be sure, let me double-check.\n\nI remember that MacArthur and Wilson developed the Theory of Island Biogeography in the 1960s. It was a significant work that combined ideas from ecology and evolution to explain the number of species on islands and how that number changes over time.\n\nThe theory suggests that the number of species on an island is balanced between the rate at which new species colonize the island and the rate at which existing species go extinct. It also takes into account the size of the island and its distance from the mainland, which affect colonization and extinction rates.\n\nYeah, that sounds right. So, given that, it's clear that MacArthur and Wilson are the ones who pioneered the field of island biogeography.\n\nJust to make sure there aren't any other scientists who might have contributed equally to this field, let me think about it some more. While others may have built upon their work or contributed to related areas in ecology, MacArthur and Wilson are indeed credited with developing the basic theory of island biogeography.\n\nI don't think there's any confusion here. The answer should be A. Robert MacArthur and E. O. Wilson.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
