Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.\u2026 A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\u2026 Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.\u2026 With us economy is imperative. It is a full test of our national character.\u2026 It is always the people who toil that pay.\n\u2014Calvin Coolidge, \"Economy in the Interest of All,\" June 30, 1924\nIn the passage above Coolidge is reacting against which of the following?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about Calvin Coolidge and his views on taxation and government spending. The passage is from a speech he gave in 1924, called \"Economy in the Interest of All.\" He talks a lot about the importance of protecting people's property and income from excessive taxation, saying that the power to tax can be a tool of tyranny if not used carefully. He emphasizes that the government should only tax when it's absolutely necessary and that high taxes can undermine individual freedom.\n\nSo, the question is asking what Coolidge was reacting against in this passage. The options are:\n\nA. The economic policies of his predecessor Warren G. Harding\n\nB. The growing strength of radical politics in America following the Russian Revolution\n\nC. Populist agitation in the West\n\nD. The governmental policies of the Progressive Era\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of Coolidge's presidency and the time period when he gave this speech. Calvin Coolidge became President after the death of Warren G. Harding in 1923. He was known for his conservative views, especially regarding fiscal policy. His tenure as President coincided with the Roaring Twenties, a time of economic prosperity and growth in the United States.\n\nGiven that, I need to think about what aspects of the preceding years or movements he might be responding to in this speech.\n\nOption A suggests he's reacting against the economic policies of Warren G. Harding. Now, Harding was also a Republican and generally favored business-friendly policies, so it seems unlikely that Coolidge would be criticizing his predecessor's economic approaches, especially since he was continuing in the same political tradition.\n\nOption B mentions the growing strength of radical politics in America following the Russian Revolution. The Russian Revolution occurred in 1917, and there was indeed some spread of socialist and communist ideas in the United States afterward, which led to things like the Red Scare in 1919 and 1920. However, by 1924, when Coolidge gave this speech, the Red Scare had largely subsided, and the nation was moving towards a more conservative political climate. So, while there might have been some residual concerns about radicalism, it's not clear if that was the primary focus of his speech.\n\nOption C refers to populist agitation in the West. Populist movements in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were indeed strong in the Western United States, advocating for things like agricultural subsidies, regulation of railroads, and other measures to help farmers and small businessmen against large corporations and banks. However, by the 1920s, the Populist Party had declined significantly in influence, and their agenda had been largely absorbed into the Democratic Party or other political movements. So, again, it's unclear if this was the main target of Coolidge's remarks in 1924.\n\nOption D mentions the governmental policies of the Progressive Era. The Progressive Era spanned from the late 1890s to about 1920, during which there was a push for reform in government, economy, and society. Progressives advocated for things like antitrust laws, regulatory agencies, women's suffrage, and sometimes higher taxes on the wealthy to fund social programs. The Progressive Movement peaked around World War I and began to lose steam in the 1920s.\n\nGiven that, Coolidge's emphasis on limited government, low taxes, and individual responsibility aligns more with a reaction against Progressive Era policies. His administration is often associated with a rollback of some Progressive reforms and a return to more laissez-faire economic principles.\n\nMoreover, in the passage, Coolidge is stressing the importance of protecting individual property rights and limiting taxation to only what is urgently necessary. This sounds like a direct critique of Progressive Era policies that might have involved higher taxation to fund social programs or regulatory measures.\n\nAdditionally, the Progressive Movement had supported increased government intervention in the economy to address social inequalities and market failures. Coolidge's speech seems to push back against that notion, arguing that excessive taxation is a threat to liberty and can lead to tyranny.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems most plausible that Coolidge is reacting against the governmental policies of the Progressive Era.\n\nBut, just to make sure, let me think about any other possible contexts that might have influenced his speech.\n\nIn the 1920s, there was a general shift towards conservatism in American politics, often referred to as the \"New Era\" under Coolidge and his predecessor Harding. This period was characterized by pro-business policies, reductions in income taxes, and a focus on balancing the budget.\n\nCoolidge's speech fits well into this context, as it reinforces the values of economic conservatism and limited government intervention.\n\nFurthermore, the Progressive Movement had been associated with a belief in the expertise of government officials and a willingness to use the power of the state to achieve social and economic goals. Coolidge's speech can be seen as a counterpoint to that philosophy, emphasizing instead the dangers of government overreach and the importance of individual liberty and property rights.\n\nTherefore, based on the content of the passage and the historical context, I would conclude that Coolidge is reacting against the governmental policies of the Progressive Era.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
