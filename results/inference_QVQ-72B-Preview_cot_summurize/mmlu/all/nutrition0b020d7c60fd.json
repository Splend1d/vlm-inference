                    "text": "So I need to calculate the body mass index (BMI) for someone who's 1.75 meters tall and weighs 99 kilograms. I remember that BMI is a way to measure body fat based on height and weight, and it's pretty common in doctors' offices and health checks.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for BMI. I think it's weight divided by height squared, but I should make sure I'm using the correct units. Let me double-check that.\n\nOkay, yes, the standard formula for BMI is:\n\nBMI = weight (kg) / height\u00b2 (m\u00b2)\n\nSo, it's weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. That seems straightforward.\n\nGiven that, I have the weight as 99 kg and the height as 1.75 m. So, I just need to plug these numbers into the formula.\n\nFirst, I'll square the height: 1.75 meters squared is 1.75 times 1.75.\n\nLet me calculate that: 1.75 \u00d7 1.75.\n\nWell, 1.75 times 1.75 is the same as 1.75 squared. I think 1.75 squared is 3.0625.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me verify.\n\nActually, to be precise, 1.75 squared is indeed 3.0625 because 1.75 \u00d7 1.75 is 3.0625.\n\nSo, height squared is 3.0625 meters squared.\n\nNow, I need to divide the weight by this number.\n\nBMI = 99 kg / 3.0625 m\u00b2\n\nLet me perform this division.\n\n99 divided by 3.0625.\n\nHmm, maybe I can adjust the numbers to make it easier. If I multiply both numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate the decimals, I get 9900 divided by 306.25.\n\nThat might still be tricky. Alternatively, I can think of it as 99 divided by 3.0625.\n\nLet me see, 99 divided by 3 is 33. But since it's 3.0625, it will be a bit less than that.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a calculator for this, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to divide step by step.\n\nLet's see, 3 goes into 99 thirty-three times, but that's too high because 3 times 33 is 99, but here the divisor is 3.0625, which is slightly more than 3, so the quotient will be slightly less than 33.\n\nWait, no, actually, the divisor is 3.0625, which is more than 3, so the quotient should be less than 33.\n\nMaybe I should set it up properly for long division.\n\nLet me write it as 99 \u00f7 3.0625.\n\nTo make it easier, I can multiply both numerator and denominator by 10000 to eliminate the decimals: 990000 \u00f7 306.25.\n\nStill, that's a bit cumbersome.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 99 as 99.000 and divide by 3.0625.\n\nLet me try to divide 99.000 by 3.0625.\n\nFirst, I'll see how many times 3.0625 goes into 99.\n\nWell, 30 times 3.0625 is 91.875.\n\nSubtract that from 99: 99 - 91.875 = 7.125.\n\nNow, bring down the next digit, but since it's a decimal, I can add a zero and continue.\n\nSo, 7.125 becomes 71.25.\n\nNow, how many times does 3.0625 go into 71.25?\n\nLet's see, 20 times 3.0625 is 61.25.\n\nSubtract that from 71.25: 71.25 - 61.25 = 10.00.\n\nNow, bring down another zero to make it 100.0.\n\nHow many times does 3.0625 go into 100.0?\n\nLet's try 30 times: 30 \u00d7 3.0625 = 91.875.\n\nSubtract that from 100.0: 100.0 - 91.875 = 8.125.\n\nNow, bring down another zero to make it 81.25.\n\nHow many times does 3.0625 go into 81.25?\n\nLet's see, 25 times 3.0625 is 76.5625.\n\nSubtract that from 81.25: 81.25 - 76.5625 = 4.6875.\n\nBring down another zero to make it 46.875.\n\nHow many times does 3.0625 go into 46.875?\n\nLet's try 15 times: 15 \u00d7 3.0625 = 45.9375.\n\nSubtract that from 46.875: 46.875 - 45.9375 = 0.9375.\n\nNow, bring down another zero to make it 9.375.\n\nHow many times does 3.0625 go into 9.375?\n\nLet's see, 3 times: 3 \u00d7 3.0625 = 9.1875.\n\nSubtract that from 9.375: 9.375 - 9.1875 = 0.1875.\n\nBring down another zero to make it 1.875.\n\nHow many times does 3.0625 go into 1.875?\n\nWell, less than once, so maybe 0.5 times: 0.5 \u00d7 3.0625 = 1.53125.\n\nSubtract that from 1.875: 1.875 - 1.53125 = 0.34375.\n\nBring down another zero to make it 3.4375.\n\nHow many times does 3.0625 go into 3.4375?\n\nAgain, about 1 time: 1 \u00d7 3.0625 = 3.0625.\n\nSubtract that from 3.4375: 3.4375 - 3.0625 = 0.375.\n\nBring down another zero to make it 3.75.\n\nHow many times does 3.0625 go into 3.75?\n\nAgain, about 1 time: 1 \u00d7 3.0625 = 3.0625.\n\nSubtract that from 3.75: 3.75 - 3.0625 = 0.6875.\n\nBring down another zero to make it 6.875.\n\nHow many times does 3.0625 go into 6.875?\n\nLet's try 2 times: 2 \u00d7 3.0625 = 6.125.\n\nSubtract that from 6.875: 6.875 - 6.125 = 0.75.\n\nBring down another zero to make it 7.5.\n\nHow many times does 3.0625 go into 7.5?\n\nAbout 2 times: 2 \u00d7 3.0625 = 6.125.\n\nSubtract that from 7.5: 7.5 - 6.125 = 1.375.\n\nBring down another zero to make it 13.75.\n\nHow many times does 3.0625 go into 13.75?\n\nLet's see, 4 times: 4 \u00d7 3.0625 = 12.25.\n\nSubtract that from 13.75: 13.75 - 12.25 = 1.5.\n\nBring down another zero to make it 15.0.\n\nHow many times does 3.0625 go into 15.0?\n\nAbout 4 times: 4 \u00d7 3.0625 = 12.25.\n\nSubtract that from 15.0: 15.0 - 12.25 = 2.75.\n\nBring down another zero to make it 27.5.\n\nHow many times does 3.0625 go into 27.5?\n\nLet's try 8 times: 8 \u00d7 3.0625 = 24.5.\n\nSubtract that from 27.5: 27.5 - 24.5 = 3.0.\n\nBring down another zero to make it 30.0.\n\nHow many times does 3.0625 go into 30.0?\n\nAbout 9 times: 9 \u00d7 3.0625 = 27.5625.\n\nSubtract that from 30.0: 30.0 - 27.5625 = 2.4375.\n\nBring down another zero to make it 24.375.\n\nHow many times does 3.0625 go into 24.375?\n\nLet's see, 7 times: 7 \u00d7 3.0625 = 21.4375.\n\nSubtract that from 24.375: 24.375 - 21.4375 = 2.9375.\n\nBring down another zero to make it 29.375.\n\nHow many times does 3.0625 go into 29.375?\n\nAbout 9 times: 9 \u00d7 3.0625 = 27.5625.\n\nSubtract that from 29.375: 29.375 - 27.5625 = 1.8125.\n\nBring down another zero to make it 18.125.\n\nHow many times does 3.0625 go into 18.125?\n\nLet's try 5 times: 5 \u00d7 3.0625 = 15.3125.\n\nSubtract that from 18.125: 18.125 - 15.3125 = 2.8125.\n\nBring down another zero to make it 28.125.\n\nHow many times does 3.0625 go into 28.125?\n\nAbout 9 times: 9 \u00d7 3.0625 = 27.5625.\n\nSubtract that from 28.125: 28.125 - 27.5625 = 0.5625.\n\nNow, the remainder is 0.5625, which is less than 3.0625, so I can stop here.\n\nLooking back at my divisions, I have:\n\n30\n\nPlus\n\n20\n\nPlus\n\n30\n\nPlus\n\n15\n\nPlus\n\n3\n\nPlus\n\n0.5\n\nPlus\n\n1\n\nPlus\n\n0.5\n\nPlus\n\n1\n\nPlus\n\n2\n\nPlus\n\n4\n\nPlus\n\n9\n\nPlus\n\n7\n\nPlus\n\n9\n\nPlus\n\n5\n\nSo, adding these up: 30 + 20 = 50; 50 + 30 = 80; 80 + 15 = 95; 95 + 3 = 98; 98 + 0.5 = 98.5; 98.5 + 1 = 99.5; 99.5 + 0.5 = 100; 100 + 1 = 101; 101 + 2 = 103; 103 + 4 = 107; 107 + 9 = 116; 116 + 7 = 123; 123 + 9 = 132; 132 + 5 = 137.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because I know the BMI shouldn't be that high. I must have made a mistake in adding up the partial quotients.\n\nLet me check my steps again.\n\nStarting with 99 divided by 3.0625.\n\nFirst step: 30 times 3.0625 is 91.875, subtracted from 99 gives 7.125.\n\nThen, 20 times 3.0625 is 61.25, subtracted from 71.25 gives 10.00.\n\nNext, 30 times 3.0625 is 91.875, subtracted from 100.0 gives 8.125.\n\nThen, 25 times 3.0625 is 76.5625, subtracted from 81.25 gives 4.6875.\n\nContinuing, 15 times 3.0625 is 45.9375, subtracted from 46.875 gives 0.9375.\n\nThen, 0.5 times 3.0625 is 1.53125, subtracted from 1.875 gives 0.34375.\n\nNext, 1 times 3.0625 is 3.0625, subtracted from 3.4375 gives 0.375.\n\nContinuing, 1 times 3.0625 is 3.0625, subtracted from 3.75 gives 0.6875.\n\nThen, 2 times 3.0625 is 6.125, subtracted from 7.5 gives 1.375.\n\nNext, 4 times 3.0625 is 12.25, subtracted from 13.75 gives 1.5.\n\nThen, 4 times 3.0625 is 12.25, subtracted from 15.0 gives 2.75.\n\nContinuing, 8 times 3.0625 is 24.5, subtracted from 27.5 gives 3.0.\n\nThen, 9 times 3.0625 is 27.5625, subtracted from 30.0 gives 2.4375.\n\nNext, 9 times 3.0625 is 27.5625, subtracted from 29.375 gives 1.8125.\n\nFinally, 5 times 3.0625 is 15.3125, subtracted from 18.125 gives 2.8125.\n\nNow, adding up the partial quotients: 30 + 20 = 50; 50 + 30 = 80; 80 + 15 = 95; 95 + 0.5 = 95.5; 95.5 + 1 = 96.5; 96.5 + 1 = 97.5; 97.5 + 2 = 99.5; 99.5 + 4 = 103.5; 103.5 + 9 = 112.5; 112.5 + 7 = 119.5; 119.5 + 9 = 128.5; 128.5 + 5 = 133.5.\n\nBut this still seems too high for a BMI. I must be making a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should use a more straightforward approach or check with a BMI calculator to verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can recall that BMI can also be calculated using pounds and inches, but since I have metrics, I'll stick with kilograms and meters.\n\nLet me try to use the formula again, but more carefully.\n\nBMI = weight (kg) / height\u00b2 (m\u00b2)\n\nWeight = 99 kg\n\nHeight = 1.75 m\n\nHeight squared = 1.75\u00b2 = 3.0625 m\u00b2\n\nSo, BMI = 99 / 3.0625\n\nLet me try to perform this division again, more carefully.\n\n99 \u00f7 3.0625\n\nTo make it easier, I can multiply both numerator and denominator by 10000 to eliminate decimals: 990000 \u00f7 306.25\n\nNow, 306.25 goes into 990000 how many times?\n\nLet me estimate: 3000 times 306.25 is 918750\n\nSubtract that from 990000: 990000 - 918750 = 71250\n\nNow, how many times does 306.25 go into 71250?\n\nLet's see, 200 times 306.25 is 61250\n\nSubtract that from 71250: 71250 - 61250 = 10000\n\nNow, how many times does 306.25 go into 10000?\n\nLet's try 30 times: 30 \u00d7 306.25 = 9187.5\n\nSubtract that from 10000: 10000 - 9187.5 ="
