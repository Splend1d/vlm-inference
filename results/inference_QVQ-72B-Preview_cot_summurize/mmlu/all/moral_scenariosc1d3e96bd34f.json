                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here that's asking me to judge two different scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are whether each scenario is \"wrong\" or \"not wrong,\" and I need to pick one of the four combinations: both wrong, first wrong and second not wrong, first not wrong and second wrong, or neither wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario entails.\n\nScenario 1: \"I went to the farm to see the chickens.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"I was playing cartoon movies in front of my kids.\"\n\nOkay, so both scenarios involve some action by the main character, who refers to themselves as \"I\" or \"me.\"\n\nStarting with Scenario 1, going to a farm to see chickens. Hmm, farms can be places where animals are kept for various purposes, like agriculture or sometimes for educational purposes. Chickens are common on farms; they're often kept for eggs or meat. But the scenario doesn't specify the purpose of the farm or what the person did while there.\n\nI need to consider if there's anything inherently morally wrong with going to a farm to see chickens. Well, farms can have different conditions; some are well-maintained with happy animals, while others might have poor conditions. But the scenario doesn't provide any information about the farm's conditions, so I can't assume anything negative there.\n\nAlso, seeing chickens on a farm could be a harmless activity, like a family outing or an educational trip. Unless there's something specific about the farm that makes it unethical to visit, which isn't mentioned here, I don't see an immediate moral issue with this action.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: playing cartoon movies in front of my kids. So, someone is showing cartoon movies to their children. Cartoons can be a form of entertainment for kids, and many parents use them as a way to spend time with their children or to give themselves a break.\n\nBut the question is whether this action is morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020. I need to think about what makes an action morally wrong. Generally, moral wrongs involve harming someone, treating others unfairly, or violating societal norms in a significant way.\n\nWatching cartoon movies with kids might not necessarily be harmful, depending on the content of the movies and the age appropriateness for the children. However, if the movies are age-appropriate and the parent is supervising, it's hard to see this as morally wrong.\n\nMaybe there's more context that isn't provided here. For example, if the parent is ignoring their children entirely and relying solely on movies for entertainment, that could be seen as neglectful. But the scenario just says \"playing cartoon movies in front of my kids,\" which could imply that the parent is present and perhaps engaging with the children in some way.\n\nAlternatively, if the movies being shown are inappropriate for the children's age or contain content that could be detrimental to their well-being, that would be a different matter. But again, the scenario doesn't specify any details about the movies or the context.\n\nGiven the information provided, it seems that neither scenario is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet me double-check this. In Scenario 1, going to a farm to see chickens could be a perfectly innocent and educational activity. Unless there's something wrong with the farm, like animal cruelty, which isn't indicated here, I don't see an issue.\n\nIn Scenario 2, playing cartoon movies for kids is a common parental practice. Assuming the movies are suitable for the children's ages and that the parent is present and supervising, this seems acceptable.\n\nSo, my answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other perspective that might see these actions as wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 1, perhaps someone could argue that visiting a farm supports farming practices, which might be environmentally unfriendly or involve animal cruelty. However, this would be an indirect consequence, and the action itself\u2014going to see chickens\u2014isn't inherently wrong unless the farm is known for unethical practices, which isn't specified here.\n\nFor Scenario 2, some might argue that screen time is bad for children's development or that it encourages sedentary behavior. While excessive screen time can have negative effects, moderate use of educational or entertaining media is generally considered acceptable, especially under parental supervision.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, I believe that neither scenario constitutes a clearly morally wrong action.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
