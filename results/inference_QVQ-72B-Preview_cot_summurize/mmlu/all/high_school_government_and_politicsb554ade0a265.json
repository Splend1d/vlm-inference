                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the opposition to Samuel Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court in 2006. The groups mentioned are the ACLU, the National Association of Women Lawyers, and the AFL-CIO. They were all against his nomination. The question is asking what this opposition is an example of, and the options are realignment, coalition building, impeachment, or a recall election.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means in the context of politics and government.\n\nStarting with realignment: I think this has to do with shifts in political parties or voter loyalties over time. Like, after certain events, the political landscape can change, and people might switch their allegiance from one party to another. But in this case, we're talking about specific groups opposing a nomination, not necessarily a long-term shift in political affiliations. So, maybe realignment isn't the best fit here.\n\nNext, coalition building. A coalition is when different groups come together to work towards a common goal, even if they don't agree on everything else. In politics, this happens a lot, especially when multiple organizations team up to support or oppose a piece of legislation, a candidate, or, in this case, a nomination. The fact that the ACLU, NAWL, and AFL-CIO are all opposing Alito's nomination suggests that they have a shared interest in this particular issue, despite possibly having different focuses or agendas otherwise. So, this seems plausible.\n\nImpeachment is a process where a government official is accused of misconduct and faces trial, usually in the legislative branch. For Supreme Court justices, impeachment can happen if they're accused of crimes or other misbehaviors while in office. But in this scenario, Alito was being nominated to the position; he hadn't even started yet. So, impeachment doesn't make sense here because you can't impeach someone who isn't yet in office.\n\nA recall election is a way for voters to remove an elected official from office before their term is up, typically through a direct vote. This is different from impeachment, as it's initiated by the electorate rather than the legislature. However, Supreme Court justices are appointed for life and can only be removed through impeachment by Congress. There's no recall process for federal judges or justices. So, this option also doesn't apply to Alito's nomination.\n\nGiven these explanations, the most fitting answer seems to be coalition building. The ACLU, NAWL, and AFL-CIO are all different organizations with their own specific interests: civil liberties, women's rights in law, and labor rights, respectively. By uniting to oppose Alito's nomination, they're showing that they have a common concern regarding his potential appointment to the Supreme Court. This kind of collaboration across different interest groups is a classic example of coalition building.\n\nTo sum it up, the opposition by these groups to Samuel Alito's nomination is an example of coalition building, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
