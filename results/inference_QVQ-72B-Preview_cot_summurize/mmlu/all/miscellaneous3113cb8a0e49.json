                    "text": "So I need to figure out which of these options is equal to one square foot. The choices are 50 square inches, 77 square inches, 100 square inches, and 144 square inches. Hmm, I think I remember that there are 12 inches in a foot, but I'm not sure how that translates into square inches for area.\n\nLet me start by recalling what a square foot is. A square foot is a unit of area, right? It's defined as the area of a square that's one foot on each side. So, if one side is one foot, and area is length times width, then it should be 1 foot times 1 foot, which is 1 square foot.\n\nBut I need to convert that into square inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, maybe I just need to multiply 12 by 12 to get the area in square inches. Let me do that: 12 inches times 12 inches should be 144 square inches.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check. One foot is 12 inches, so:\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width = 12 inches \u00d7 12 inches = 144 square inches.\n\nSo, according to this calculation, one square foot is equal to 144 square inches. Looking back at the options, D is 144 square inches.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't some other factor I should consider. Is there any other way to look at this conversion? Maybe using the relationship between square feet and square meters, but that might be complicating things unnecessarily.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about linear measurements first and then convert the area. For example, one foot is equal to 12 inches, so one linear foot is 12 inches. Therefore, a square foot should be (12 inches) squared, which is 144 square inches.\n\nYeah, that seems consistent with my initial calculation. Let me consider if there's a different approach, perhaps using conversion factors.\n\nI know that to convert units, I can use multiplication by conversion factors. So, if I have 1 square foot, I can express that as:\n\n1 ft\u00b2 = (12 in)\u00b2 = 144 in\u00b2\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of multiplying by conversion factors:\n\n1 ft\u00b2 \u00d7 (12 in / 1 ft)\u00b2 = 1 ft\u00b2 \u00d7 (12 in)\u00b2 / (1 ft)\u00b2 = 144 in\u00b2\n\nThis again confirms that one square foot is equal to 144 square inches.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check online or in a textbook to verify this conversion. I recall that in the imperial system, area units like square feet and square inches relate through the linear conversion factors squared.\n\nFor example, since 1 foot = 12 inches, then:\n\n1 ft\u00b2 = (12 in)\u00b2 = 144 in\u00b2\n\nYes, this matches what I've found through my calculations.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possibility of confusion here. Is there a scenario where one square foot would equal a different number of square inches? I don't think so, because the relationship between feet and inches is fixed: 1 foot is always 12 inches.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. 144 square inches.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll eliminate the other options:\n\nA. 50 square inches: This is less than 144, so it's incorrect.\n\nB. 77 square inches: Still less than 144, not matching our calculation.\n\nC. 100 square inches: Closer but still less than 144.\n\nD. 144 square inches: Matches our calculation, so this is the correct answer.\n\nI feel confident about this now. One square foot is indeed equal to 144 square inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
