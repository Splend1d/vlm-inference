Under the terms of its contract with the owner of the apartment building, the company agreed to carry out regular monthly inspections of the elevator and to make all necessary repairs. The elevator was installed in the apartment complex in January. For the next 10 months, the company made regular inspections. However, starting in November, the company began to have some difficulties with its employees and failed to send inspectors out for three successive months. On February 20, a woman went to visit her friend, who was a tenant on the 20th floor of the building. The woman used the intercom to call up to the friend, who buzzed to unlock the front door so that the woman could enter the building. The woman headed to the elevator. When the doors opened, several people were already inside the elevator, apparently having entered the elevator from the parking garage below the building. One of the people in the elevator was a man who acted shifty and nervous. By the 12th floor, only four persons were left, including the woman and the man. At that floor, the other two people left, leaving the woman and the man alone on the elevator. Apprehensive at finding herself alone with such an unkempt stranger, the woman pressed the 13th floor button, intending to step out and hoping to find other persons on that floor. Unfortunately, the elevator stalled, and came to a stop between the 12th and 13th floors. The woman's fears were justified, as the man suddenly grabbed at her purse. When the woman resisted, the man struck her, and she fell unconscious. When the woman recovered consciousness, she found herself in a hospital with a concussion and multiple contusions on her body. She later learned that the elevator had remained stalled for 50 minutes. Thereafter, it moved to the 20th floor, where she was found by her friend, who took her to the hospital. Two weeks later, the police arrested the man and found the woman's purse in his possession. This was the first assault that had occurred in the apartment building. The elevator's stalling was caused by a defective cable that a routine inspection would have discovered. If the woman brings suit against the owner of the apartment building for negligence, she will most likely\n\nA. recover, because she was an invitee of a tenant in the building.\nB. recover, because the owner would be vicariously liable for the company's failure to inspect the elevator.\nC. not recover, because the woman was negligent in failing to exit the elevator on the 12th floor when the other occupants exited the elevator.\nD. not recover, because there had been no previous assaults in the apartment building.\n"

                    "text": "Alright, let's dive into this case. So, there's this apartment building where an elevator was installed by a company, and they agreed to do regular monthly inspections and make any necessary repairs. The elevator was put in place in January, and for the next 10 months, everything went smoothly with the inspections. But then, starting in November, the company had some employee issues and missed three months of inspections. That's a red flag right there.\n\nNow, in February, a woman goes to visit her friend who lives on the 20th floor. She uses the intercom, gets buzzed in, and heads to the elevator. When she gets there, several people are already inside, including one guy who seems shifty and nervous. By the time they reach the 12th floor, only she and this guy are left in the elevator. She feels uneasy being alone with him and presses the button for the 13th floor, hoping to find someone there for safety.\n\nUnfortunately, the elevator stalls between the 12th and 13th floors. The guy suddenly grabs her purse, and when she resists, he hits her, causing her to lose consciousness. She wakes up in a hospital with a concussion and multiple bruises. It turns out the elevator was stuck for 50 minutes before it finally moved to the 20th floor, where her friend found her and took her to the hospital.\n\nThe police later arrest the guy and find the woman's purse in his possession. This was the first assault in the building, and it's discovered that the elevator stalled due to a defective cable that a routine inspection would have caught.\n\nNow, the woman wants to sue the owner of the apartment building for negligence. The question is, will she most likely recover?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Recover because she was an invitee of a tenant in the building.\n\nB. Recover because the owner would be vicariously liable for the company's failure to inspect the elevator.\n\nC. Not recover because the woman was negligent in not exiting the elevator on the 12th floor when the other occupants left.\n\nD. Not recover because there had been no previous assaults in the apartment building.\n\nFirst, let's consider the concept of negligence. To succeed in a negligence claim, the plaintiff (the woman) must prove four elements:\n\n1. Duty of care: The defendant (the owner) had a legal obligation to act in a certain way toward the plaintiff.\n\n2. Breach of duty: The defendant failed to meet that obligation.\n\n3. Causation: The breach of duty was the direct cause of the plaintiff's injury.\n\n4. Damages: The plaintiff suffered some harm as a result.\n\nLet's apply these to the scenario.\n\n**Duty of care:**\n\nApartment owners have a duty to maintain their properties in a safe condition, especially common areas like elevators. They are expected to take reasonable steps to ensure the safety of tenants and their guests. So, the owner had a duty to maintain the elevator properly and ensure it was safe for use.\n\n**Breach of duty:**\n\nThe elevator company was contracted to perform monthly inspections and make necessary repairs. However, they missed three months of inspections due to employee issues. During this time, a defective cable went unnoticed, which caused the elevator to stall. This suggests that the owner, through their contracted company, breached their duty to maintain the elevator safely.\n\n**Causation:**\n\nThe elevator stalled because of the defective cable, which should have been caught during a routine inspection. The stalling led to the woman being trapped alone with the attacker for an extended period. Had the elevator been properly inspected and repaired, it might not have stalled, potentially preventing the assault.\n\n**Damages:**\n\nThe woman suffered physical injuries (concussion and bruises), emotional trauma, and likely medical expenses as a result of the assault.\n\nGiven these points, it seems that the owner's negligence in maintaining the elevator contributed to the woman's injuries.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A:** Recover because she was an invitee of a tenant in the building.\n\nBeing an invitee means she was lawfully on the premises, which she was, as she was visiting her friend. Apartment owners owe a higher duty of care to invitees. However, this alone doesn't guarantee recovery; it just establishes the duty of care. There needs to be a breach of that duty causing harm.\n\n**Option B:** Recover because the owner would be vicariously liable for the company's failure to inspect the elevator.\n\nVicarious liability generally applies when an employer is responsible for the actions of their employees in the course of employment. Here, the elevator company was contracted by the owner to perform inspections. If the company was an independent contractor, the owner might not be directly vicariously liable for the company's actions. However, the owner could still be liable if they were negligent in hiring or supervising the contractor.\n\nBut, in this case, the owner had a duty to ensure the elevator was safe, and by failing to inspect it properly, they breached that duty, regardless of whether the elevator company was an independent contractor.\n\n**Option C:** Not recover because the woman was negligent in not exiting the elevator on the 12th floor when the other occupants left.\n\nThis touches on the concept of comparative negligence. Even if the woman was somewhat negligent, in many jurisdictions, her damages can be reduced by her degree of fault but she can still recover some compensation. However, in some states, if the plaintiff's negligence is a proximate cause of the injury, they may not recover anything (contributory negligence).\n\nIn this case, the woman's decision not to exit on the 12th floor might be seen as a minor factor compared to the elevator stalling due to the owner's negligence in maintenance. It's unlikely that her choice not to exit would be seen as the primary cause of the injury.\n\n**Option D:** Not recover because there had been no previous assaults in the apartment building.\n\nThe fact that this was the first assault suggests that the owner may not have had actual knowledge of a specific risk of assault in the elevator. However, the owner still has a general duty to maintain the elevator in a safe operating condition, regardless of past incidents.\n\nMoreover, the assault was facilitated by the elevator stalling, which was due to the defective cable\u2014a maintenance issue. So, even without prior assaults, the owner's failure to maintain the elevator properly contributed to the harm.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that the woman has a strong case for negligence against the owner. The owner's failure to inspect and maintain the elevator led directly to the elevator stalling, which created an opportunity for the assault to occur.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that she will recover damages from the owner.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
