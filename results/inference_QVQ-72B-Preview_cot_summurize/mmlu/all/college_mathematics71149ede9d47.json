                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: I need to find out how many additive abelian groups G of order 16 have the property that for every element x in G, x + x + x + x equals zero. And I need to consider these groups up to isomorphism, meaning that groups that are essentially the same just with different labels should be counted as one.\n\nFirst off, I know that an abelian group is a group where the operation is commutative, and in this case, the operation is addition. The order of the group is 16, so there are 16 elements in total.\n\nThe condition x + x + x + x = 0 for every x in G is interesting. It means that every element has order dividing 4, because if I add an element to itself four times and get zero, then the order of that element can't be more than 4. So, every element in G has order 1, 2, or 4.\n\nNow, I need to classify all such groups of order 16 up to isomorphism. I recall that every finite abelian group can be expressed as a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. Since 16 is 2 to the 4th power, I'm dealing with groups that are direct products of cyclic groups of order powers of 2, up to order 16.\n\nSo, the possible decompositions of the group are:\n\n1. Z_16\n\n2. Z_8 \u00d7 Z_2\n\n3. Z_4 \u00d7 Z_4\n\n4. Z_4 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2\n\n5. Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2\n\nBut wait, I need to check which of these satisfy the condition that x + x + x + x = 0 for all x in G.\n\nLet's consider each case:\n\n1. Z_16: In Z_16, the element 1 has order 16. Let's see what 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 is. That's 4, which is not zero in Z_16. So, this group doesn't satisfy the condition. Eliminate this one.\n\n2. Z_8 \u00d7 Z_2: In Z_8, the element 1 has order 8. Let's see 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 in Z_8; that's 4, which is not zero. So, even in the direct product with Z_2, there will be elements where x + x + x + x \u2260 0. For example, (1,0) in Z_8 \u00d7 Z_2. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 in Z_8 is 4, which is not zero, and 0 in Z_2 is zero. So, (4,0) \u2260 (0,0). This group also doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\n3. Z_4 \u00d7 Z_4: In Z_4, the element 1 has order 4. So, 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 0 in Z_4. Similarly, for any element in Z_4, 4 times itself is zero. Therefore, in Z_4 \u00d7 Z_4, for any element (a,b), 4*(a,b) = (4a,4b) = (0,0). So, this group does satisfy the condition.\n\n4. Z_4 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2: In Z_4, again, the element 1 has order 4, so 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 0. Similarly, in Z_2, any element added to itself twice is zero, so four times is also zero. Therefore, for any element in Z_4 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2, adding it four times will give (0,0,0). So, this group also satisfies the condition.\n\n5. Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2: Here, every component is Z_2, so adding any element four times will give zero since 4 times any element in Z_2 is zero. Therefore, this group satisfies the condition as well.\n\nSo far, I have three groups that satisfy the condition: Z_4 \u00d7 Z_4, Z_4 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2, and Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if any of these are isomorphic to each other. If they are, then they should be counted as one group up to isomorphism.\n\nLet's recall that for abelian groups, the structure is determined by their invariant factors or their elementary divisors. In this case, the elementary divisors are the orders of the cyclic groups in the direct product.\n\n- Z_4 \u00d7 Z_4 has elementary divisors (4,4)\n\n- Z_4 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 has elementary divisors (4,2,2)\n\n- Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 has elementary divisors (2,2,2,2)\n\nThese are all distinct up to isomorphism because their elementary divisor lists are different.\n\nAlternatively, I can look at the number of elements of each order:\n\n- In Z_4 \u00d7 Z_4, the number of elements of order 4 can be calculated. Each Z_4 has one element of order 4, so in Z_4 \u00d7 Z_4, there are 16 elements of order 4.\n\n- In Z_4 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2, the number of elements of order 4 would be different.\n\n- In Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2, all non-identity elements have order 2.\n\nSo, these groups are not isomorphic to each other.\n\nTherefore, there are three such groups up to isomorphism that satisfy the given condition.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. Is there any other group that I might have missed?\n\nLet me list all possible abelian groups of order 16 and check their properties.\n\nThe abelian groups of order 16 are:\n\n1. Z_16\n\n2. Z_8 \u00d7 Z_2\n\n3. Z_4 \u00d7 Z_4\n\n4. Z_4 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2\n\n5. Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2\n\nWe've already checked that Z_16 and Z_8 \u00d7 Z_2 do not satisfy the condition, while Z_4 \u00d7 Z_4, Z_4 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2, and Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 do.\n\nAre there any other abelian groups of order 16? I don't think so. According to the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, these are all of them.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 3.\n\nBut let's consider if there could be any other groups that satisfy the condition. Suppose there is a group where every element has order dividing 4. This means that the group is a vector space over the field with 2 elements, since x + x = 0 for all x (because x + x added twice gives zero, but wait, no.\n\nActually, if every element has order dividing 4, it doesn't necessarily mean that x + x = 0. For example, in Z_4, x + x = 2x \u2260 0 unless x is 0 or 2. So, in Z_4, not all elements satisfy x + x = 0.\n\nBut in Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2, every element satisfies x + x = 0.\n\nWait, but in Z_4 \u00d7 Z_4, not all elements satisfy x + x = 0. For example, (1,0) + (1,0) = (2,0) \u2260 0.\n\nSo, having x + x + x + x = 0 for all x doesn't imply that x + x = 0 for all x.\n\nBut perhaps there's a connection here that I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the exponent of the group. The exponent of a group is the smallest positive integer n such that x^n = e for all x in G. In this case, since x + x + x + x = 0 for all x, the exponent divides 4. So, the exponent is either 1, 2, or 4.\n\nBut the identity element has order 1, so that's fine.\n\nSo, the group has exponent dividing 4.\n\nNow, among the abelian groups of order 16, which ones have exponent dividing 4?\n\n- Z_16 has exponent 16.\n\n- Z_8 \u00d7 Z_2 has exponent 8.\n\n- Z_4 \u00d7 Z_4 has exponent 4.\n\n- Z_4 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 has exponent 4.\n\n- Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 has exponent 2, which divides 4.\n\nSo, again, only Z_4 \u00d7 Z_4, Z_4 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2, and Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 satisfy the condition.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 3.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, since x + x + x + x = 0 for all x, this means that 4x = 0 for all x, where 4x means x added to itself four times.\n\nIn terms of group theory, this is equivalent to saying that the group is a vector space over the field Z_4, but that doesn't quite make sense because Z_4 isn't a field. Z_4 is a ring, so the group is a Z_4-module.\n\nBut perhaps thinking in terms of modules is overcomplicating things.\n\nAlternatively, since 4x = 0 for all x, this implies that the group is annihilated by 4, meaning that 4 times any element is zero.\n\nThis is similar to saying that the group is a Z/4Z-module.\n\nBut again, maybe sticking to the classification of abelian groups is simpler.\n\nAnother approach: since the group has order 16, which is 2^4, it's a finite abelian 2-group.\n\nIn such groups, every element has order a power of 2.\n\nGiven that 4x = 0 for all x, and since 4 = 2^2, this means that the group is annihilated by 4, which implies that the exponent of the group divides 4.\n\nSo, the possible exponents are 1, 2, or 4.\n\nExponent 1 is just the trivial group, which has only one element, not our case.\n\nExponent 2 is the group where every element has order 2, which is Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2.\n\nExponent 4 includes groups like Z_4 \u00d7 Z_4 and Z_4 \u00d7 Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2.\n\nSo, again, we have three groups satisfying the condition.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
