                    "text": "So I've got this legal puzzle here. Let's try to unpack it step by step. There's a woman who, in 2001, transferred a piece of land to her friend for one dollar. She did this with some conditions attached. The deed says the land goes to her friend \"for life, but if liquor is ever sold on the tract of land, then to my cousin and his heirs, and if for any reason the interest hereby conveyed to my cousin is not valid, then I reserve the right to re-enter the tract of land and take back my property.\"\n\nAlright, so first off, the woman is conveying the land to her friend for life. That sounds like a life estate. So, the friend has the right to use and enjoy the land during her lifetime. But there's a condition: if liquor is ever sold on the land, then the interest passes to the woman's cousin and his heirs. That sounds like a contingent remainder in favor of the cousin, triggered by the sale of liquor on the property.\n\nThen, there's another clause: \"and if for any reason the interest hereby conveyed to my cousin is not valid, then I reserve the right to re-enter the tract of land and take back my property.\" This seems like a provision for reverter if the cousin's interest doesn't take effect for some reason.\n\nNow, in 2004, the friend dies intestate, before she could harvest the wheat she had planted. The question is, who is entitled to the proceeds of the crop?\n\nLet's think about this. The friend had a life estate in the land. During her lifetime, she could use the land, which includes planting crops. But upon her death, what happens to her interest?\n\nIn general, when someone with a life estate dies, the property interest reverts to the remainderman, unless there are other provisions.\n\nIn this case, the remainder interest seems to be contingent upon the condition that liquor is not sold on the land. So, as long as that condition is met, the cousin would take the property upon the termination of the life estate.\n\nBut the friend died before the wheat could be harvested. So, the question is, who owns the crop at the time of her death?\n\nGenerally, crops planted on land are considered part of the real property during their growth, but once harvested, they become personal property. So, the proceeds from the crop would be personal property belonging to the estate of the friend, unless there's some agreement to the contrary.\n\nBut wait, the friend died before the wheat was harvested. Does that mean that the crop is still part of the real property, or has it already separated from the land?\n\nI think that crops are considered part of the real property until they're harvested. So, at the time of the friend's death, the crop was still part of the land.\n\nBut upon her death, her life estate terminated. So, the ownership of the land would pass according to the deed's provisions.\n\nSince the condition about selling liquor hasn't been triggered, the cousin's interest hasn't vested yet. So, unless liquor is sold, the cousin doesn't get the property.\n\nBut the deed also says that if the cousin's interest isn't valid for any reason, then the woman reserves the right to re-enter and take back the property.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I need to look into how life estates and contingent remainders work in property law.\n\nLet me recall: a life estate gives someone the right to use property for their lifetime, and then it passes to the remainderman. If there's a condition attached to the remainder interest, like not selling liquor, and if that condition is violated, the interest would pass to the cousin.\n\nBut in this case, there's no indication that liquor was sold on the land, so the cousin's interest hasn't vested.\n\nSo, upon the friend's death, who gets the property? If the cousin's interest isn't valid yet, does it go back to the original grantor, the woman?\n\nBut the woman reserved the right to re-enter if the cousin's interest isn't valid.\n\nThis seems like a possibility of reverter back to the woman.\n\nSo, if the friend dies and her life estate ends, and the cousin's interest hasn't vested because the condition hasn't been met, then the property reverts to the woman.\n\nBut the woman is the original grantor, and she reserved the right to take back the property if the cousin's interest isn't valid.\n\nSo, perhaps the property reverts to her.\n\nBut what about the crop that the friend planted? The friend died before she could harvest it. Does the crop belong to her estate, or does it pass with the land?\n\nI think that crops planted on land are part of the real property until they're harvested, and then they become personal property.\n\nSo, at the time of the friend's death, the crop was still part of the land.\n\nTherefore, upon the termination of her life estate, the land, including the crop, would pass to whoever has the next interest in the property.\n\nGiven that the cousin's interest is contingent upon the sale of liquor, which hasn't happened, the property reverts to the woman.\n\nTherefore, the woman would be entitled to the proceeds of the crop, since the crop is part of the land and passes with it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the friend's estate has some rights to the crop, since it was her labor and investment that went into planting it.\n\nBut in property law, generally, crops are considered part of the real property until harvested.\n\nSo, unless there's some agreement to the contrary, the crop would pass with the land.\n\nBut in this case, the friend had a life estate, which included the right to harvest crops during her lifetime.\n\nHowever, she died before she could harvest the wheat.\n\nSo, perhaps the right to harvest the crop passes to whoever inherits the life estate or the remainder interest.\n\nBut the life estate terminated upon her death, and the remainder interest is contingent upon the sale of liquor.\n\nSince that condition hasn't been met, the cousin doesn't get the property yet.\n\nTherefore, the property reverts to the woman.\n\nHence, she would be entitled to the proceeds of the crop.\n\nBut let me consider another angle. Maybe the friend's estate has some rights to the crop because it was her investment.\n\nHowever, in property law, crops are generally considered part of the real property until harvested, and then they become personal property.\n\nSo, at the time of her death, the crop was still part of the land.\n\nTherefore, upon her death, the land, including the crop, passes to the next owner, which in this case is the woman, due to the reverter clause.\n\nTherefore, the woman is entitled to the proceeds of the crop.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. The woman.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
