                    "text": "So I have this question about regression, and I need to figure out which of these statements is false. Let's see, I've heard about regression in statistics and machine learning classes, but I might have forgotten some details. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that regression relates inputs to outputs. That sounds right. In regression analysis, we typically have independent variables (inputs) and a dependent variable (output), and we try to model how the dependent variable changes based on the independent variables. So, this seems like a correct statement.\n\nOption B says that regression is used for prediction. Yeah, that makes sense too. Once we have a regression model, we can use it to predict the output for new inputs that the model hasn't seen before. For example, if I have a regression model that predicts house prices based on features like size and location, I can plug in the values for a new house and get an estimated price. So, this seems correct as well.\n\nOption C says that regression may be used for interpretation. Hmm, I think this is also true. Regression models, especially linear regression, can help us understand the relationship between the input variables and the output. The coefficients in a linear regression model tell us how much the output is expected to change when one input variable changes by one unit, holding all other variables constant. This can be really useful for understanding which factors influence the output the most. So, I think this is also a correct statement.\n\nOption D says that regression discovers causal relationships. Now, this one seems a bit tricky. I remember learning that correlation does not imply causation, and regression can show correlations between variables, but it doesn't necessarily prove causality. For example, just because two variables are correlated, it doesn't mean that one causes the other. There might be other factors at play that affect both variables. So, I think this statement is false.\n\nTo make sure, let's think about it a bit more. In regression analysis, we can adjust for confounding variables to try to isolate the effect of one variable on another. However, even then, it's difficult to establish causality without experimental data or strong theoretical foundations. So, while regression can suggest possible causal relationships, it doesn't definitively prove them. Therefore, it's not accurate to say that regression discovers causal relationships.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I believe that option D is the false statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
