                    "text": "So I've got this investment problem here. It says that the investment will generate income that grows at 5% per year forever. The market discount rate is 15%, and the next payout is $10. I need to find the value of the investment. The options are $1, $500, $100, or $200.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how to value a growing perpetuity. A perpetuity is a stream of cash flows that continues forever. When the cash flows grow at a constant rate, it's called a growing perpetuity.\n\nThe formula for the present value of a growing perpetuity is:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{C}{r - g} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( C \\) is the cash flow (payout) in the next period.\n\n- \\( r \\) is the discount rate.\n\n- \\( g \\) is the constant growth rate of the cash flow.\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- \\( C = \\$10 \\)\n\n- \\( r = 15\\% \\) or \\( 0.15 \\)\n\n- \\( g = 5\\% \\) or \\( 0.05 \\)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{10}{0.15 - 0.05} = \\frac{10}{0.10} = 100 \\]\n\nSo, the value of the investment should be $100.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm using the correct formula and understanding the terms.\n\nThe problem says \"income that grows at 5% p.a. forever.\" That sounds like a growing perpetuity, which is what I've treated it as.\n\nAlso, the market discount rate is 15%, which should be used as the discount rate \\( r \\).\n\nThe next payout is $10, which should be \\( C \\).\n\nSo, plugging into the formula again:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{10}{0.15 - 0.05} = \\frac{10}{0.10} = 100 \\]\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider? Maybe the timing of the cash flows. In perpetuity problems, the cash flows are usually at the end of each period. The formula I used assumes that the first cash flow is received one period from now.\n\nGiven that, $10 is the next payout, which would be at the end of the first period.\n\nSo, the present value should indeed be \\( \\frac{10}{0.15 - 0.05} = 100 \\).\n\nLooking back at the options, $100 is one of them. So, the answer should be C. $100.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about it differently.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can consider the present value of future cash flows.\n\nThe cash flows are growing at 5% per year forever.\n\nYear 1: $10\n\nYear 2: $10 * 1.05 = $10.50\n\nYear 3: $10.50 * 1.05 = $11.025\n\nAnd so on, forever.\n\nTo find the present value, we can discount each cash flow back to today at the discount rate of 15%.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{10}{1.15^1} + \\frac{10.50}{1.15^2} + \\frac{11.025}{1.15^3} + \\cdots \\]\n\nThis is a geometric series with the first term \\( \\frac{10}{1.15} \\) and common ratio \\( \\frac{1.05}{1.15} \\).\n\nThe sum of an infinite geometric series is \\( \\frac{a}{1 - r} \\), where \\( a \\) is the first term and \\( r \\) is the common ratio.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{ \\frac{10}{1.15} }{ 1 - \\frac{1.05}{1.15} } \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{ \\frac{10}{1.15} }{ \\frac{0.10}{1.15} } = \\frac{10}{1.15} \\times \\frac{1.15}{0.10} = \\frac{10}{0.10} = 100 \\]\n\nAgain, this confirms that the present value is $100.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the growth rate is 5% and the discount rate is 15%, so the present value is \\( \\frac{C}{r - g} \\), which is \\( \\frac{10}{0.15 - 0.05} = 100 \\).\n\nTherefore, the value of the investment is $100.\n\nI think that's solid. The answer should be C. $100.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
