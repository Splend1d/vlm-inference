                    "text": "So I'm looking at these statements about activation functions in neural networks. The first one says that the ReLU's gradient is zero for x less than zero, and the sigmoid gradient is sigma(x)(1 - sigma(x)) which is less than or equal to 1/4 for all x. The second statement says that the sigmoid has a continuous gradient and the ReLU has a discontinuous gradient.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to recall what ReLU and sigmoid functions are, and what their gradients look like.\n\nStarting with ReLU, which stands for Rectified Linear Unit. Its formula is f(x) = max(0, x). So, for x less than zero, it's zero, and for x greater than or equal to zero, it's just x. Now, the gradient or derivative of ReLU is zero when x is less than zero, and one when x is greater than zero. At x equals zero, it's typically defined as zero or one, but often in implementations, it's one.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? I think in some libraries, like TensorFlow, the gradient at zero is defined as one for numerical stability. But the general idea is that for negative x, it's zero, and for positive x, it's one.\n\nNow, for the sigmoid function, which is sigma(x) = 1 / (1 + e^{-x}). Its derivative is sigma'(x) = sigma(x)(1 - sigma(x)). I need to verify if this derivative is always less than or equal to 1/4.\n\nLet's think about the sigmoid function. It's an S-shaped curve that asymptotes to zero as x approaches negative infinity and to one as x approaches positive infinity. Its derivative reaches a maximum when x is zero.\n\nAt x = 0, sigma(0) = 1/2, so sigma'(0) = (1/2)(1 - 1/2) = 1/4. For other values of x, sigma(x)(1 - sigma(x)) will be less than 1/4 because sigma(x) will be either closer to zero or closer to one, making (1 - sigma(x)) smaller.\n\nSo, yes, the sigmoid gradient is always less than or equal to 1/4.\n\nMoving on to the second statement: the sigmoid has a continuous gradient, and the ReLU has a discontinuous gradient.\n\nFirst, sigmoid: since it's a smooth function, its derivative should also be continuous. The derivative of sigmoid is sigma(x)(1 - sigma(x)), which is continuous everywhere because sigma(x) is continuous.\n\nNow, ReLU: its derivative is zero for x < 0 and one for x > 0. At x = 0, it has a discontinuity because the left derivative (zero) doesn't equal the right derivative (one). So, yes, the gradient of ReLU is discontinuous.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nSince both statements are true, the answer should be A. True, True.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst statement: ReLU's gradient is zero for x < 0 \u2013 that's correct. Sigmoid gradient is sigma(x)(1 - sigma(x)) <= 1/4 for all x \u2013 that also seems right, as at x = 0, it's 1/4, and elsewhere, it's less.\n\nSecond statement: sigmoid has a continuous gradient \u2013 yes, because both sigma(x) and 1 - sigma(x) are continuous, and their product is continuous. ReLU has a discontinuous gradient \u2013 correct, due to the jump at x = 0.\n\nSo, yeah, both statements are true. The answer should be A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
