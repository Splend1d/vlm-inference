                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about color perception under different lighting conditions. So, there's a piece of paper that looks blue in sunlight, and it's being illuminated solely by a red light that's passed through a green filter. I need to figure out what color the paper appears under this illumination. The options are blue, green, red, or black.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how colors work in terms of light. Colors that we see depend on the wavelengths of light that are reflected or transmitted by objects. Sunlight is composed of all colors of the spectrum, and when it shines on an object, the object reflects certain wavelengths and absorbs others. For example, a blue piece of paper reflects blue light and absorbs other colors.\n\nSo, in sunlight, the paper reflects blue light, which is why it appears blue. But now, instead of sunlight, it's being illuminated by a red light that's passed through a green filter. I need to figure out what light is actually reaching the paper after passing through the green filter.\n\nLet's think about the red light first. Red light is a specific wavelength range in the visible spectrum. Now, this red light is passing through a green filter. Filters selectively transmit certain wavelengths and absorb others. A green filter should transmit green light and absorb other colors, including red.\n\nSo, if the red light is passing through a green filter, the filter will absorb the red light and not let it through. That means no red light is actually reaching the paper. Instead, the green filter might be transmitting some green light, but since the light source is red, there's no green light to transmit.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to consider that the green filter could be reflecting or transmitting some green light, but in this case, the only light source is red, so the filter might just absorb the red light and not let anything through.\n\nBut that seems contradictory because if no light is passing through the filter, then the paper shouldn't receive any light and would appear dark. However, maybe the green filter does transmit some light when illuminated by red, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to recall how filters work. A green filter typically transmits green light and absorbs red and blue light. So, if you shine red light through a green filter, the filter should absorb the red light and not transmit it. Therefore, no light should reach the paper.\n\nBut perhaps there's some interaction between the red light and the green filter that could result in some light passing through. Maybe the filter reflects some light back, but I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Suppose I have a red light shining on a green filter. Since the filter absorbs red light, it should appear red to an observer because it's absorbing the red light and possibly reflecting other colors, but in this case, since the light source is only red, maybe it just gets absorbed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it in terms of subtraction of colors. When light passes through a filter, the filter subtracts certain colors from the incoming light.\n\nSo, if red light is shone through a green filter, the filter subtracts red, leaving behind... well, nothing, because red is the only color present, and the filter is supposed to transmit green. So, no light should pass through.\n\nTherefore, the paper receives no light, meaning it should appear black.\n\nBut let's check another angle. Maybe there's some interaction between the red light and the green filter that could result in some light passing through.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the green filter might reflect some of the red light, but I don't think that's the case. Filters are designed to absorb specific wavelengths and transmit others.\n\nSo, if the red light is being absorbed by the green filter, and no light is passing through to the paper, then the paper should appear black.\n\nWait, but maybe the paper reflects some of the red light even if it's blue, but I think that in this scenario, since only red light is present and the paper is blue, which reflects blue light, it wouldn't reflect the red light, so it would appear dark.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the paper appears black under this illumination.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D.
