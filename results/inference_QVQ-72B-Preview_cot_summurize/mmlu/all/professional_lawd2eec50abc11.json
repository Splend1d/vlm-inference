The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the landowner and begins formulating plans for constructing single-family dwelling units on the land. The original deed between the landowner and the development company contains a provision expressly binding \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called phase 1. Two years later, the president sold the remaining parcel, which had not been included in the phase 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single-family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as phase 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in phase 2. Meanwhile, after the landowner's death, his estate is required to sell the remaining 250-acre parcel of his farmland. The buyer is an investor, who proposes to construct a two-level shopping center and parking lot on the property. The deed for the remaining 250-acre parcel contained the identical restrictions as the deeds to the other three parcels.

                    "text": "So I've got this land development scenario, and I need to figure out what the residents of Phase 1 can do about a proposed shopping center being built on a nearby parcel of land. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a landowner who has 1,000 acres of farmland. As he gets older, he decides to sell some of it in 250-acre parcels. He sells three of these parcels to a development company, and there's a provision in the deed that binds all future owners to restrict any further subdivisions to minimum two-acre lots for single-family homes only. So, this is like a covenant running with the land, right?\n\nThe development company then buys these three parcels and subdivides two of them into lots that are three, four, and five acres each, and starts building homes. They call this Phase 1. The original deed restrictions are included in the deeds to the homeowners in Phase 1.\n\nTwo years later, the president of the development company sells the remaining parcel to a contractor. This contractor subdivides it into one-acre lots and builds single-family homes, calling it Phase 2. But here's the thing: the deeds to the Phase 2 homeowners don't mention the two-acre minimum lot size restriction.\n\nAfter the landowner dies, his estate has to sell the last 250-acre parcel. This parcel is bought by an investor who wants to build a two-level shopping center and parking lot on it. The deed for this parcel has the same restrictions as the others, meaning it's supposed to be restricted to two-acre lots for single-family homes.\n\nBut the investor ignores this restriction and uses political influence to get the county zoning board to rezone the parcel for commercial use. Now, the residents of Phase 1 are trying to stop the construction of the shopping center.\n\nSo, the question is, what are the chances of the Phase 1 residents succeeding in their attempt to enjoin, or stop, the construction of the shopping center?\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. Little chance of preventing the projected commercial development.\n\nB. No standing to enjoin the construction of the shopping center.\n\nC. No chance of succeeding, because the zoning ordinance takes precedence over the covenant running with the land.\n\nD. Success in their cause of action in accordance with the common development scheme.\n\nOkay, I need to understand each of these options.\n\nFirst, standing. In law, standing refers to the right or legal interest that a party has to bring a lawsuit or seek an injunction. So, do the Phase 1 residents have standing to enjoin the construction?\n\nWell, they are adjacent property owners who might be directly affected by the construction of a shopping center. That could give them standing based on potential nuisances or decreases in property value. So, option B seems unlikely because they probably do have standing.\n\nNext, option C says they have no chance because the zoning ordinance takes precedence over the covenant running with the land.\n\nI need to recall how zoning ordinances and covenants interact. Zoning ordinances are generally regulations passed by local governments to control land use, while covenants are private agreements between property owners that restrict how the property can be used.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, covenants can run with the land and bind future owners, as long as they meet certain requirements, like being in writing, touching and concerning the land, and having horizontal and vertical privity.\n\nNow, if there's a conflict between a zoning ordinance and a covenant, which one prevails? Generally, covenants are private agreements and can be enforced between private parties, while zoning ordinances are public regulations enforced by the government.\n\nHowever, if the zoning ordinance conflicts with a covenant, the covenant might still be enforceable in court between the parties who are bound by it.\n\nIn this case, the investor got the parcel rezoned for commercial use, but the deed restriction still exists. So, even if the zoning allows for commercial use, the covenant restricts the use to two-acre lots for single-family homes.\n\nSo, the residents might argue that the covenant should be enforced despite the zoning change, because the covenant is a private agreement that runs with the land.\n\nTherefore, option C seems incorrect because the covenant might still be enforceable despite the zoning change.\n\nNow, option A says they have little chance of preventing the projected commercial development.\n\nBut based on the covenant, they might have a strong case to enforce the restriction.\n\nFinally, option D says they will have success in their cause of action in accordance with the common development scheme.\n\nA common development scheme typically refers to a plan where multiple parcels of land are developed under a single set of restrictions or covenants.\n\nIn this case, all four parcels were originally subject to the same restriction via the deed from the landowner.\n\nSo, if the residents can show that there was a common development scheme with uniform restrictions, they might have a stronger case for enforcing the covenant against the investor's parcel.\n\nBut wait, the investor's parcel was the last one sold by the landowner's estate, and it was subject to the same restrictions as the others.\n\nHowever, the investor ignored the restriction and got the zoning changed.\n\nSo, the residents would likely argue that the covenant is still enforceable and that the zoning change doesn't nullify the covenant.\n\nMoreover, the covenant specifically binds all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns, so it should apply to the investor as well.\n\nBut, I need to consider if there's any way the covenant could be unenforceable.\n\nOne thing to consider is whether the covenant was recorded properly. Since it was in the original deed and passed down through the subsequent deeds, I assume it was recorded.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the covenant is enforceable against the Phase 2 lots, which were subdivided into one-acre lots without mentioning the two-acre minimum.\n\nIf the covenant runs with the land, it should bind all subsequent grantees, even if the restriction isn't explicitly mentioned in later deeds.\n\nHowever, in practice, it's better if the restriction is noted in each subsequent deed to avoid confusion.\n\nBut legally, if the covenant runs with the land, it should still apply.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the residents of Phase 1 are likely to have a strong case to enforce the covenant against the investor's parcel, preventing the construction of the shopping center.\n\nTherefore, option D seems the most accurate.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the covenant runs with the land and binds all subsequent grantees, and the investor's parcel is subject to the same restriction, then the residents should be able to enforce it.\n\nThe fact that the investor used political influence to get the zoning changed doesn't necessarily override the covenant.\n\nUnless there's some law that says zoning changes invalidate covenants, which I don't think is generally the case.\n\nSo, I think the residents will have success in their cause of action.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
