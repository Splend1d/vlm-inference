                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out who an 'injured State' is in the context of international responsibility. The options seem a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break them down one by one.\n\nOption A says that a State is 'injured' if it has suffered damage from an internationally wrongful conduct. That sounds straightforward. If a state is harmed by another state's actions that violate international law, it makes sense that it would be considered injured. But is damage a necessary condition to be an injured state? I need to think about that.\n\nOption B states that a State is 'injured' if there has been a violation of a peremptory norm of international law. Peremptory norms are fundamental principles of international law that cannot be overridden by other rules. So, if a state violates one of these, any state could potentially be considered injured because these norms are meant to protect the international community as a whole. But does that mean every state is automatically injured in such cases, even if they haven't suffered direct damage?\n\nOption C suggests that a State is 'injured' if it acknowledges the existence of the internationally wrongful conduct. This seems a bit odd. Just by recognizing that a wrong has occurred, a state becomes injured? That doesn't seem right. I think there needs to be more than just acknowledgment; there should be some sort of interest or right violated that affects the state directly.\n\nOption D is a bit more complex. It says that a State is 'injured' if the obligation breached was owed to it individually or if it was owed to a group of States, including that State, and it was specially affected. This seems to align with the idea that a state is injured when its rights or interests are directly affected by the wrongful act. So, it's not just about general norms being violated, but about specific obligations that were owed to that state.\n\nLet me try to recall what I've learned about international responsibility and injured states. The International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts define an injured state as one whose rights have been violated by the wrongful act. So, it's about the direct violation of a state's rights or interests.\n\nOption A talks about suffering damage, which is related to the concept of prejudice, which includes both damage and loss. In international law, to claim reparation, a state must show that it has suffered prejudice as a result of the wrongful act. So, in that sense, damage is relevant, but is it the only criterion?\n\nOption B mentions peremptory norms. While violations of these norms are particularly serious and can lead to erga omnes obligations (obligations owed to all states), not every state necessarily suffers direct injury. Some states might have a more direct interest than others. For example, in a case of aggression against a specific state, all states might consider it a violation of peremptory norms, but the state being aggressed against is directly injured.\n\nOption C seems too vague. Acknowledging the existence of a wrongful conduct doesn't automatically make a state injured. There needs to be a closer connection between the wrongful act and the state's rights being violated.\n\nOption D seems the most accurate because it refers to obligations owed specifically to the state in question, either individually or as part of a group, and requires that the state be specially affected. This aligns with the idea that a state is injured when its rights are directly violated by the wrongful act.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose State A violates an international treaty with State B. Clearly, State B is the injured state because its rights under the treaty have been violated. Now, if State A violates a peremptory norm, like a prohibition against genocide, then all states could argue that their rights have been violated, but some might have a stronger claim if they are directly affected.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I think Option D is the correct answer because it captures the idea that a state is injured when its specific rights or interests are directly affected by the wrongful act, whether individually or as part of a group of states.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
