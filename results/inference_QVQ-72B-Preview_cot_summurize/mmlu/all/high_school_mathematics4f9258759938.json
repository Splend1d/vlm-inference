                    "text": "Let's see what this problem is asking. I need to find the ones digit of the product of all the numbers from 1 to 9, which is written as \\(1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 9\\). So, I have to multiply all these numbers together and then find the last digit of the result.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate the product step by step. Let's start multiplying from left to right.\n\nStart with 1 multiplied by 2: \\(1 \\cdot 2 = 2\\).\n\nThen multiply that by 3: \\(2 \\cdot 3 = 6\\).\n\nNext, multiply by 4: \\(6 \\cdot 4 = 24\\). The last digit here is 4.\n\nNow, multiply by 5: \\(24 \\cdot 5 = 120\\). The last digit is 0.\n\nWait a minute, I see a 0 here. So, if I have a 0 in the product, does that mean the entire product is 0? Because anything multiplied by 0 is 0.\n\nLet me check: the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. None of these are 0, but in the multiplication sequence, we got a 0 when we multiplied 24 by 5.\n\nHmm, but 24 times 5 is indeed 120, which has a units digit of 0. Does that mean the final product has a units digit of 0?\n\nBut let's think carefully. If I have a product that includes 5 and an even number, like 2 or 4 or 6 or 8, then yes, the product will have 0 as its units digit because 5 times an even number ends with 0.\n\nIn this case, among 1 through 9, we have 5 and several even numbers: 2, 4, 6, and 8. So, the product will definitely end with 0.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I should consider the prime factors or think about the properties of numbers that would lead to a units digit of 0.\n\nI know that a number ends with 0 if it's divisible by 10, and 10 can be factored into 2 and 5. So, if in the product, both 2 and 5 are present as factors, then the product will be divisible by 10, hence ending with 0.\n\nIn the numbers from 1 to 9, we have 2 and 5, so the product will include both as factors, making the product divisible by 10, thus ending with 0.\n\nBut let's double-check by actually calculating the product to see if indeed it ends with 0.\n\nLet's compute the product step by step:\n\nStart with 1.\n\nMultiply by 2: 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nMultiply by 3: 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nMultiply by 4: 6 * 4 = 24.\n\nMultiply by 5: 24 * 5 = 120.\n\nMultiply by 6: 120 * 6 = 720.\n\nMultiply by 7: 720 * 7 = 5040.\n\nMultiply by 8: 5040 * 8 = 40320.\n\nMultiply by 9: 40320 * 9 = 362880.\n\nLooking at the final product, 362880, the units digit is 0. So, the ones digit of the product is indeed 0.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
