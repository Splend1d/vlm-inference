The length of the toothbrush.\n\nD. Half an inch.\n\nHmm, let me think about this. I remember that when I was a kid, my parents told me to use a pea-sized amount of toothpaste. But is that still the recommendation for adults? Maybe things have changed since then.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: A smear. That sounds like not enough. I mean, toothpaste helps clean your teeth by providing abrasives and fluoride, so just a smear might not be sufficient to do a thorough job.\n\nOption B: A pea-sized amount. This seems familiar. I think I've heard this before, especially for children. But for adults, is more needed, or is a pea-sized amount still adequate?\n\nOption C: The length of the toothbrush. Well, toothbrushes come in different sizes. Mine seems pretty long, so if I were to cover the entire length with toothpaste, that would be a lot of paste. That can't be right. It would probably be too much, and I'd be wasting toothpaste.\n\nOption D: Half an inch. This sounds like a specific measurement. Half an inch is about the size of a pea, right? So, this seems similar to option B.\n\nMaybe the recommendation is a pea-sized amount or half an inch for adults, and less for children. Let me try to recall if there's a standard measurement.\n\nI think the American Dental Association recommends using about a pea-sized amount of toothpaste for adults. For children under three, it's just a smear, and for kids aged three to six, a pea-sized amount as well.\n\nWait, so for adults, it's still a pea-sized amount. That would correspond to option B.\n\nBut option D, half an inch, seems similar in size, so that might also be correct.\n\nLet me see if I can find any specific guidelines. I recall that toothpaste bottles often have labels indicating how much to use. For example, some bottles have markings for a pea-sized amount.\n\nAlso, using too much toothpaste isn't necessarily better. In fact, it might lead to swallowing excess toothpaste, which could be harmful due to the fluoride content. So, it's important to use the right amount.\n\nGiven that, I think the best answer is B. A pea-sized amount.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the other options again.\n\nOption A: A smear. That's more suitable for toddlers, not adults.\n\nOption C: The length of the toothbrush. This could vary too much based on the brush size and could potentially lead to using too much toothpaste.\n\nOption D: Half an inch. This is roughly the same as a pea-sized amount, but the standard recommendation seems to be a pea-sized amount.\n\nTherefore, I believe B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
