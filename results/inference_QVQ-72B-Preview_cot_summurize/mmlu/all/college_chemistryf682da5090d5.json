                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out the EPR spectrum of the t-Bu radical, which is (CH3)3C\u2022. I need to find the ratio of line intensities in its EPR spectrum. The options are quite detailed, so I have to be careful with my reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance) spectrum represents. EPR is a spectroscopic technique used to study species with unpaired electrons, like free radicals. In this case, the t-Bu radical has one unpaired electron, which gives it paramagnetic properties.\n\nThe spectrum shows lines that correspond to different energy levels of the electron in a magnetic field, considering the interaction with nearby nuclear spins. This interaction is called hyperfine splitting.\n\nFor the t-Bu radical, which is (CH3)3C\u2022, there are three methyl groups attached to a central carbon atom, which has an unpaired electron. Each methyl group consists of one carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms. So, in total, there are 3 carbon atoms and 9 hydrogen atoms.\n\nNow, I need to consider which of these atoms interact with the unpaired electron via hyperfine coupling. Typically, hydrogen atoms (protons) couple more strongly with the unpaired electron than carbon atoms, especially if the carbon is not directly bonded to the radical center.\n\nIn the t-Bu radical, the unpaired electron is on the central carbon atom. The three methyl groups are attached to this central carbon. So, the protons in the methyl groups are likely to interact with the unpaired electron.\n\nEach methyl group has three equivalent protons. So, there are a total of 9 equivalent protons interacting with the unpaired electron.\n\nWait a minute, are all these protons equivalent? In the t-Bu radical, all three methyl groups are identical due to the symmetry of the molecule. Therefore, all protons should be equivalent, meaning they have the same hyperfine coupling constant.\n\nIf that's the case, then we can treat all 9 protons as equivalent, and the EPR spectrum should show a simple hyperfine pattern corresponding to coupling with 9 equivalent protons.\n\nTo determine the intensity ratio of the EPR lines, we can use the formula for the number of lines in a hyperfine pattern, which is (2nI + 1), where n is the number of equivalent nuclei and I is the spin quantum number of each nucleus.\n\nFor protons, I = 1/2. So, for 9 equivalent protons, the number of lines should be (2*(9)*(1/2) + 1) = 10 lines.\n\nThe intensity ratio of these lines can be determined using the multinomial coefficients, which account for the different combinations of proton spin alignments.\n\nThe general formula for the intensity ratio is given by the coefficients of the expansion of (x + y)^n, where n is the number of equivalent nuclei.\n\nIn this case, n=9, so the coefficients correspond to the binomial coefficients for n=9: 1, 9, 36, 84, 126, 126, 84, 36, 9, 1.\n\nWait, but that would give 10 lines, which matches our earlier calculation. However, looking back at the options, option B is 1:9:36:84:126:126:84:36:9:1, which matches this binomial distribution.\n\nBut hold on, is this the correct approach? I recall that in EPR spectroscopy, the hyperfine splitting patterns can be more complex, especially when there are multiple sets of equivalent nuclei with different coupling constants.\n\nIn the t-Bu radical, are all 9 protons equivalent in terms of their hyperfine coupling to the unpaired electron?\n\nGiven the tetrahedral geometry around each carbon atom, the methyl groups are symmetrically arranged around the central carbon. Therefore, all protons should experience the same hyperfine coupling.\n\nHowever, in reality, due to the symmetry and the equivalence of the methyl groups, it's reasonable to assume that all 9 protons are equivalent.\n\nBut let's consider if there could be any nonequivalence.\n\nIf one of the methyl groups were different, perhaps due to some asymmetry, then we might have to treat the protons differently.\n\nBut in the t-Bu radical, all three methyl groups are identical due to the molecule's symmetry. Therefore, all protons should be equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the hyperfine splitting should indeed result in 10 lines with the intensity ratio given by the binomial coefficients for n=9, which is option B: 1:9:36:84:126:126:84:36:9:1.\n\nHowever, I notice that option A is 1:19:36:84:126:126:84:36:19:1, which seems similar but has a 19 instead of 9 in the second and second-to-last positions.\n\nOption C is 1:9:35:82:120:120:82:35:9:1, which is close but not exactly the same as the binomial coefficients.\n\nOption D is 1:8:28:56:70:56:28:8:1, which corresponds to n=8, but that doesn't match our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, based on the binomial coefficients for n=9, option B seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let's think again. In EPR, the hyperfine splitting is determined by the interaction between the unpaired electron and the nuclear spins of the surrounding atoms.\n\nGiven that all 9 protons are equivalent, the hyperfine pattern should indeed follow the binomial coefficients for n=9.\n\nHowever, sometimes in real spectra, there might be second-order effects or other interactions that could modify the simple binomial distribution.\n\nBut for the purpose of this problem, and based on the principles of hyperfine splitting in EPR, option B seems to be the correct choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different approach to calculate the intensity ratios.\n\nLet me consider the spin statistics.\n\nEach proton has a spin of 1/2, and there are 9 of them.\n\nThe total nuclear spin, F, can range from 9/2 to 9/2 in half-integer steps.\n\nThe number of nuclear spin states for a given F is (2F + 1).\n\nTherefore, the relative intensity of each hyperfine line corresponds to the number of nuclear spin states that give rise to that particular energy level.\n\nThis is essentially what the binomial coefficients represent.\n\nSo, for n=9 protons, each with I=1/2, the intensity ratio should be 1:9:36:84:126:126:84:36:9:1, which matches option B.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that option B is the correct intensity ratio for the EPR spectrum of the t-Bu radical.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{B}\\]"
