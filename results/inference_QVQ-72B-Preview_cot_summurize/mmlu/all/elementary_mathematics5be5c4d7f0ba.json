                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about Mr. Kelly putting an equal number of rolls of paper towels into 4 rooms. There are 12 rolls in total, and he wants to divide them equally among the 4 rooms. So, he uses the equation 12 \u00f7 t = 4 to find out how many rolls, t, go into each room.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what t represents here. It seems like t is the number of rolls per room. So, if he has 12 rolls and 4 rooms, dividing 12 by t gives 4. That means t must be 12 divided by 4, which is 3. So, each room gets 3 rolls.\n\nNow, the question is asking for another way Mr. Kelly can find the number of rolls per room using a different number sentence from the options given.\n\nLet's look at option A: 4 \u00f7 12 = t. If I calculate that, 4 divided by 12 is 1/3. But we already know t should be 3, not 1/3. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B: 4 \u2013 t = 12. If I solve for t, t = 4 - 12 = -8. Negative eight doesn't make sense in this context because you can't have negative rolls of paper towels. So, this can't be the right one.\n\nOption C: 4 + 12 = t. That's 16. But again, that doesn't match our earlier conclusion that t should be 3. So, this is probably incorrect.\n\nOption D: 4 \u00d7 t = 12. If I solve for t, t = 12 \u00f7 4 = 3. This matches the value we found earlier. So, this seems to be a correct alternative way to express the relationship.\n\nWait a minute, the original equation was 12 \u00f7 t = 4, and now we're looking for another equation that also leads to t = 3. Option D gives us t = 3 when multiplied by 4, which makes sense because if 4 times t equals 12, then t must be 3.\n\nLet me double-check if there's any other way this could be interpreted. The problem says \"another way Mr. Kelly can find the number of rolls of paper towels, t, he should put into each room.\"\n\nAnother approach could be to think about the total rolls divided by the number of rooms. So, total rolls are 12, number of rooms is 4, so rolls per room is 12 \u00f7 4 = 3. That's consistent with what we've found.\n\nAlternatively, if we think about the number of rooms times the rolls per room equaling the total rolls, so 4 \u00d7 t = 12, which is option D.\n\nI don't think there's another option here that fits better than D. Option A gives t = 1/3, which doesn't make sense in this context. Option B gives t = -8, which is also nonsensical. Option C gives t = 16, which doesn't fit the scenario.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D: 4 \u00d7 t = 12.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. Maybe using multiplication or addition in a different way, but given the constraints, it seems that option D is indeed the best alternative to represent the relationship between the total rolls and the number of rooms to find t.\n\nSo, the answer is D. 4 \u00d7 t = 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
