There are four options, and I need to pick the one that was not a strategy they used. The options are:\n\nA. Making all strike action illegal\n\nB. Imposing restrictions on picketing\n\nC. Banning political strikes that were not primarily concerned with the worker's own conditions of work\n\nD. Making secondary action (in support of workers elsewhere) illegal\n\nAlright, let's think about this. I remember that the Conservative government in the UK, led by Margaret Thatcher, came to power in 1979 and implemented a series of reforms to curb the influence of trade unions, which were part of the labor movement.\n\nFirst, option B: imposing restrictions on picketing. I recall that one of the early pieces of legislation they passed was the Employment Act of 1980, which did indeed impose stricter rules on picketing. So, that seems like it was definitely a strategy they used.\n\nNext, option C: banning political strikes that were not primarily concerned with the worker's own conditions of work. I think there was a move to restrict strikes that were called for political purposes or that supported causes not directly related to the workers' own employment terms. The Employment Act of 1982 might have addressed this. So, that probably was part of their strategy.\n\nThen, option D: making secondary action illegal. Secondary action refers to actions taken in support of workers in another company or industry, like sympathy strikes or boycotts. I believe the Conservative government did pass laws to make such actions unlawful, perhaps in the Employment Act of 1982 or the Trade Union Act of 1984. So, that also seems to be a strategy they employed.\n\nNow, option A: making all strike action illegal. Hmm, that sounds extreme. While the Conservative government did restrict strikes through various means, like requiring ballots before strikes could be called and restricting secondary action, I don't think they made all strikes completely illegal. There must have been some circumstances under which strikes were still permitted, perhaps after following certain procedures.\n\nLet me double-check that. I remember that the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act of 1992 consolidated previous legislation and set out rules for lawful strikes, including the need for a secret ballot of union members. So, strikes weren't entirely banned; they just had to follow specific rules to be lawful.\n\nGiven that, it seems that the Conservative government focused on regulating strikes rather than banning them outright. Therefore, making all strike action illegal was not one of their strategies.\n\nTo sum it up, the Conservative government in 1979 did implement several measures to reduce the power of the labor movement, including restricting picketing, banning political strikes, and making secondary action illegal. However, they did not make all strike action illegal.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. making all strike action illegal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
