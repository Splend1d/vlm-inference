                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about a two-sample t-test for the average gain in participants' performance in the long jump. They're planning to use a 5% level of significance, and they're asking which change would increase the power of the test. There are four options, and I need to pick the correct one.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what power means in hypothesis testing. Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it's false. So, higher power means a better chance of detecting a real effect.\n\nOption A says that changing from equal size treatment groups to very different size treatment groups would increase the power of the test. Hmm, I thought that having equal group sizes is generally better because it balances the variance between groups. Maybe not? I need to think about this. If group sizes are very different, like one group is much larger than the other, does that affect the t-test's power? I think in t-tests, equal group sizes can be more efficient, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nOption B suggests changing from a 5% significance level to a 1% significance level would increase the power of the test. I recall that the significance level \u03b1 is related to the size of the rejection region. If I decrease \u03b1 from 5% to 1%, I'm making the rejection region smaller, which means it's harder to reject the null hypothesis. That sounds like it would decrease the power, not increase it. So, this probably isn't the correct choice.\n\nOption C says that taking more careful measurements to reduce variability in the response would increase the power of the test. This makes sense. If the variability decreases, the standard error of the mean should decrease as well, which would make it easier to detect a difference between the groups. So, this seems like a plausible option.\n\nOption D mentions that increasing the sample size would reduce the probability of a Type I error. Wait, Type I error is rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true. The probability of a Type I error is \u03b1, which is set by the significance level. Increasing the sample size doesn't change \u03b1; it affects the power of the test. Actually, increasing sample size generally increases the power of the test, making it easier to detect true effects. So, this statement seems confusing. If sample size increases, power increases, which might reduce Type II errors (failing to reject a false null hypothesis), but it doesn't directly reduce Type I errors. So, probably not the right choice.\n\nSo, between options A, B, C, and D, option C seems to be the most accurate. Reducing variability by taking more careful measurements should increase the power of the test.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. In t-tests, power is influenced by several factors: effect size, sample size, significance level (\u03b1), and variability. Increasing \u03b1 increases power, but option B suggests decreasing \u03b1 from 5% to 1%, which would decrease power. So, that's definitely not the right choice. Option A about unequal group sizes\u2014I think that unequal group sizes can lead to less power because the t-test assumes equal variances by default, and unequal group sizes can affect the precision of the estimate. So, maybe that's not the best choice either.\n\nOption D about increasing sample size reducing Type I error seems off because Type I error is controlled by \u03b1, not by sample size. Increasing sample size makes the test more sensitive to detecting true effects, which should increase power, but it doesn't directly affect the probability of a Type I error.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C: taking more careful measurements to reduce variability in the response would increase the power of the test.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
