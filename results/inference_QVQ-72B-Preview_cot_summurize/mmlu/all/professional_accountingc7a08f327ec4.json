                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Vinton exchanged unimproved land for an apartment building. The land had a basis of $300,000 and a fair market value of $420,000, and there was a mortgage of $100,000 on it. The apartment building had a fair market value of $550,000 and a mortgage of $230,000. Both parties assumed each other's mortgages. I need to find Vinton's basis in the apartment building after this exchange.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a basis is. The basis of an asset is generally the cost or other value you use to determine your gain or loss when you sell or exchange the asset. When you exchange one asset for another, your basis in the new asset is usually the same as your basis in the old asset, adjusted for any money or other property you receive or give in the exchange. This is called a carryover basis.\n\nSo, starting point: Vinton's basis in the land is $300,000.\n\nNext, there are mortgages involved. When you exchange mortgaged property, the mortgage is considered part of the exchange. If you assume the mortgage on the property you receive, that affects your basis.\n\nVinton's land has a mortgage of $100,000, and he assumes the apartment building's mortgage of $230,000.\n\nI think I need to account for the mortgages in determining Vinton's basis in the apartment building.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the mortgage assumption as part of the consideration in the exchange.\n\nWhen Vinton assumes the mortgage on the apartment building, that's like taking on additional debt, which reduces his basis in the apartment building.\n\nSimilarly, when the other party assumes the mortgage on the land, that's like Vinton receiving cash, which would increase his basis in the apartment building.\n\nWait, actually, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.\n\nIn a like-kind exchange, the basis of the new property is generally the basis of the old property, plus any money paid, minus any money received, and adjusted for mortgages.\n\nSpecifically, the basis of the new property is:\n\nBasis of old property + (mortgage assumed by other party) - (mortgage you assume) + (boot paid) - (boot received)\n\nIn this case:\n\n- Basis of old property (land): $300,000\n\n- Mortgage on land assumed by other party: $100,000\n\n- Mortgage on apartment building assumed by Vinton: $230,000\n\n- There's no mention of any additional money paid or received (boot) in the exchange, so that might be zero.\n\nSo, basis in apartment building = $300,000 + $100,000 - $230,000 = $170,000\n\nBut that's not one of the options provided. The options are $300,000, $320,000, $430,000, and $550,000.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me consider the fair market values. The land has an FMV of $420,000 and the apartment building has an FMV of $550,000. But I don't think fair market values directly affect the basis calculation in a like-kind exchange, unless there's a taxable gain or loss, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider whether there's any taxable gain or loss on the exchange.\n\nIf the exchange is a like-kind exchange, typically no gain or loss is recognized, and the basis carries over.\n\nBut if there's boot involved, there might be taxable gain.\n\nHowever, in this problem, it seems like only property is being exchanged, with mortgages being assumed, so perhaps it's a like-kind exchange with no boot.\n\nBut my earlier calculation gave $170,000, which isn't among the options.\n\nLet me look up the rules for basis calculation in like-kind exchanges with mortgages.\n\nUpon researching, I find that in a like-kind exchange, the basis of the new property is generally the basis of the old property, plus any money paid, minus any money received, and adjusted for mortgages.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Basis of new property = Basis of old property + (mortgage on old property assumed by other party) - (mortgage on new property assumed by you) + (boot paid) - (boot received)\n\nIn this case:\n\n- Basis of old property: $300,000\n\n- Mortgage on old property assumed by other party: $100,000\n\n- Mortgage on new property assumed by Vinton: $230,000\n\n- No boot paid or received mentioned\n\nSo, $300,000 + $100,000 - $230,000 = $170,000\n\nBut since $170,000 isn't an option, maybe there's something else to consider.\n\nPerhaps the fair market values come into play somehow.\n\nLet me think about the exchange again.\n\nVinton exchanges land worth $420,000 for an apartment building worth $550,000.\n\nBut there are mortgages involved.\n\nThe land has a mortgage of $100,000, and the apartment building has a mortgage of $230,000.\n\nWhen Vinton assumes the $230,000 mortgage, that's like taking on debt, which reduces his basis in the apartment building.\n\nWhen the other party assumes the $100,000 mortgage on the land, that's like Vinton receiving $100,000 in debt relief, which increases his basis in the apartment building.\n\nSo, basis in apartment building = basis in land + debt relief - debt assumed + boot paid - boot received.\n\nAgain, $300,000 + $100,000 - $230,000 = $170,000\n\nThis suggests that Vinton's basis in the apartment building should be $170,000, but that's not among the options.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the fair market values differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the basis is the fair market value of the apartment building minus the mortgage Vinton assumes, plus any other adjustments.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right, because in like-kind exchanges, the basis is supposed to carry over, adjusted for differences in debt.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the difference in the fair market values and how that affects the basis.\n\nLet me see: the land is worth $420,000 and the apartment building is worth $550,000.\n\nSo, Vinton is receiving something worth $550,000 for his $420,000 land.\n\nBut since there are mortgages involved, perhaps there's a difference in the liabilities that needs to be accounted for.\n\nLet me calculate the net equity in each property.\n\nEquity in land = FMV - mortgage = $420,000 - $100,000 = $320,000\n\nEquity in apartment building = FMV - mortgage = $550,000 - $230,000 = $320,000\n\nInteresting, both properties have the same equity of $320,000.\n\nMaybe the basis in the new property is equal to the equity in the old property, which would be $320,000.\n\nThat's option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the basis is the same as the old basis, $300,000, which is option A.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, because the mortgages are changing hands.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the basis adjustment based on the difference in the mortgages.\n\nThe mortgage on the land is $100,000, and on the apartment building is $230,000.\n\nSo, Vinton is assuming an additional $130,000 in debt ($230,000 - $100,000).\n\nAssuming debt reduces basis.\n\nSo, basis in apartment building = basis in land + debt relief - debt assumed.\n\nDebt relief is the $100,000 mortgage on the land that the other party is assuming.\n\nDebt assumed is the $230,000 mortgage on the apartment building.\n\nSo, $300,000 + $100,000 - $230,000 = $170,000\n\nAgain, $170,000 isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the fair market value of the apartment building, which is $550,000, and subtract the mortgage Vinton is assuming, which is $230,000, giving an equity of $320,000, which matches option B.\n\nBut that seems too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the basis is the old basis plus the difference in the mortgages.\n\nDifference in mortgages is $230,000 - $100,000 = $130,000, which Vinton is assuming.\n\nSo, basis in apartment building = $300,000 - $130,000 = $170,000\n\nStill getting $170,000, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that when Vinton assumes the $230,000 mortgage, it reduces his basis by that amount, and when the other party assumes the $100,000 mortgage, it increases his basis by that amount.\n\nSo, $300,000 + $100,000 - $230,000 = $170,000\n\nBut since $170,000 isn't an option, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the concept of boot.\n\nBoot is any money or other property received or given in addition to the like-kind property.\n\nIn this exchange, only property and mortgages are involved, so no boot is mentioned.\n\nHowever, sometimes, the difference in mortgages can be considered as boot.\n\nIf that's the case, perhaps the difference in mortgages is treated as boot received or paid.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the basis is calculated based on the equity in the old property.\n\nEquity in land = $420,000 - $100,000 = $320,000\n\nEquity in apartment building = $550,000 - $230,000 = $320,000\n\nSo, Vinton's basis in the apartment building is $320,000.\n\nThat seems plausible, and it's option B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the basis is the same as the old basis, $300,000, which is option A.\n\nBut that doesn't account for the difference in the mortgages.\n\nOption C is $430,000, which might be $300,000 + $130,000, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption D is $550,000, which is the FMV of the apartment building, but in like-kind exchanges, basis isn't usually the FMV.\n\nI think the best answer is $320,000, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
