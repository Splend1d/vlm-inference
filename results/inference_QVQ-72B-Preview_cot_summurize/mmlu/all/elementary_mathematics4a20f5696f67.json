I need to find out how long it took him to wash his car.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many quarters he used. Since each quarter costs $0.25, I can divide the total amount he spent by the cost per quarter.\n\nSo, $3.25 divided by $0.25 should give me the number of quarters.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 3.25 \u00f7 0.25.\n\nWell, 0.25 times 13 is 3.25. So, he used 13 quarters.\n\nNow, each quarter gives him 60 seconds of car wash time. So, if he used 13 quarters, the total time would be 13 times 60 seconds.\n\nLet me calculate that: 13 \u00d7 60.\n\n60 times 10 is 600, and 60 times 3 is 180. So, 600 + 180 = 780 seconds.\n\nBut I think it's better to have the time in minutes, since the options are in minutes.\n\nThere are 60 seconds in a minute, so I need to divide 780 by 60 to get the time in minutes.\n\n780 \u00f7 60.\n\n60 times 13 is 780, so that's 13 minutes.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 10 minutes\n\nB. 13 minutes\n\nC. 16 minutes\n\nD. 32.5 minutes\n\nSo, 13 minutes seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nHe spent $3.25, each quarter is $0.25, so 3.25 \u00f7 0.25 = 13 quarters.\n\nEach quarter gives 60 seconds, so 13 \u00d7 60 = 780 seconds.\n\n780 seconds divided by 60 equals 13 minutes.\n\nYeah, that seems right.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any overlap or if the time continues to run even if he's not actively washing. But the problem seems straightforward, so I think 13 minutes is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach this problem, like considering if he used multiple quarters at once or something, but no, the problem says one quarter operates the car wash for 60 seconds, so I think my calculation is correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 13 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 13 \\ \\text{minutes}} \\]"
