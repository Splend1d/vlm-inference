                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which case first defined the meaning of the \"margin of appreciation\" doctrine as applied by the European Court of Human Rights. The options are Goodwin v UK (2002), Airey v Ireland (1979), Osman v UK (1998), and Handyside v UK (1976). I need to recall which of these cases introduced or solidified the concept of margin of appreciation.\n\nFirst off, I know that the margin of appreciation is a principle in European human rights law that allows member states some leeway in how they implement the rights set out in the European Convention on Human Rights. It's like a buffer zone where states can make their own decisions within certain limits, considering their particular social, cultural, and political contexts.\n\nNow, let's look at each case one by one to see which one was pivotal in defining this doctrine.\n\nStarting with Goodwin v UK (2002): I remember that this case involved the recognition of transsexuals' rights. The applicant, a transsexual, had undergone sex reassignment surgery and wanted to be recognized as a woman in law. The UK government refused to recognize her new gender, leading to the case before the European Court of Human Rights. The Court found a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private life) and Article 12 (right to marry). But I don't recall this case being the first to define the margin of appreciation doctrine. Maybe it built upon existing precedents.\n\nNext, Airey v Ireland (1979): This case was about a woman who couldn't get legal aid to defend herself in divorce proceedings. The Court found that her inability to obtain legal aid violated her right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the Convention. In its judgment, the Court did refer to the margin of appreciation, acknowledging that states have some discretion in how they organize their legal aid systems. But again, I'm not sure if this was the first time the doctrine was defined.\n\nThen there's Osman v UK (1998): This case involved allegations that UK authorities failed to prevent the applicant's son from being murdered, despite having been warned of the risk. The Court found violations of Article 2 (right to life) and Article 13 (right to an effective remedy). In its reasoning, the Court likely discussed the balance between individual rights and state responsibilities, but again, I don't think this was the first case to define the margin of appreciation.\n\nFinally, Handyside v UK (1976): This case is older than the others, dating back to 1976. It involved a magazine publisher who was prosecuted for distributing material that was considered obscene. The Court had to balance the right to freedom of expression under Article 10 against the right to protect morals under Article 10(2). This case is often cited as a key example of the Court applying the margin of appreciation doctrine, recognizing that states have a certain degree of discretion in regulating moral issues.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about it differently. Instead of trying to recall which case was first, perhaps I should consider the evolution of the doctrine and see where it was first clearly articulated.\n\nI know that the margin of appreciation doctrine has been developed over time through various cases. It's a principle that reflects the Court's recognition of the diversity among member states and their different legal and cultural traditions.\n\nLet me consider the timeline:\n\n- Handyside v UK (1976): This is one of the earliest cases where the doctrine was clearly applied, especially in the context of freedom of expression.\n\n- Airey v Ireland (1979): This case came three years later and also referred to the margin of appreciation, but perhaps not as foundational as Handyside.\n\n- Osman v UK (1998): This is much later and likely built upon earlier precedents.\n\n- Goodwin v UK (2002): Again, a more recent case that probably relies on the established doctrine.\n\nSo, based on this timeline, Handyside v UK (1976) seems like a strong candidate for being the first case to define the meaning of the margin of appreciation doctrine.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another angle. Maybe there were earlier cases that touched upon the doctrine, but Handyside was the one that solidified it.\n\nI recall that in the case of Sunday Times v UK (1979), which was around the same time as Airey, the Court also discussed the margin of appreciation in the context of freedom of expression. However, Handyside is still considered a landmark case in this area.\n\nAnother relevant case is Van der Mussele v Belgium (1979), which also involved Article 10 and the margin of appreciation.\n\nBut again, Handyside seems to be the earliest and most influential case in defining the doctrine.\n\nPerhaps I should look at the actual wording used in these cases. In Handyside, the Court explicitly stated that there is a margin within which the Contracting States are free to regulate their own legal systems in accordance with their conceptions of public morality, provided that the restrictions applied do not pursue an \"arbitrary policy\" and are not \"excessive.\"\n\nThat sounds very much like a clear formulation of the margin of appreciation doctrine.\n\nIn contrast, while Airey v Ireland also mentions the margin of appreciation, it might be building upon the foundations laid in Handyside rather than introducing the concept anew.\n\nSimilarly, Osman v UK and Goodwin v UK, being later cases, would have built upon the existing doctrine.\n\nTherefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that Handyside v UK (1976) was the first case to define the meaning of the doctrine of margin of appreciation as applied by the European Court of Human Rights.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D.
