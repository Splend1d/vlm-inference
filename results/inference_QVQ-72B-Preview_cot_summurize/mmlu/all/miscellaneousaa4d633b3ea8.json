Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out which one is the correct name for a fruit that's a cross between a tangerine and a grapefruit.\n\nFirst off, I know that when you cross two different types of fruits, you can get a hybrid fruit. For example, a tangelo is supposed to be a cross between a tangerine and a grapefruit. Wait, is that right? I think I've heard of tangelos before. Let me think about that.\n\nOption C is tangelo, which sounds familiar. But let me consider all the options to make sure.\n\nOption A is graperine. That sounds like a made-up name, combining \"grape\" and \"tangerine,\" but I don't recall that being an actual fruit name.\n\nOption B is tangefruit. That seems like another made-up name, maybe combining \"tangerine\" and \"fruit,\" but again, not sure if that's a real fruit.\n\nOption D is kumquat. I know kumquats are small, citrusy fruits, but they're not a cross between tangerines and grapefruits. I think they're their own thing.\n\nSo, based on this, option C, tangelo, seems like the most plausible answer. I remember that tangelos are indeed a cross between a tangerine and a grapefruit. Let me double-check this to be absolutely sure.\n\nI recall that tangerines and grapefruits are both types of citrus fruits, and they can interbreed to produce hybrids. Tangelo is one such hybrid. It's also sometimes called ugli fruit, especially in certain regions, but that's another name for the same fruit.\n\nSo, if I'm correct, the name of the fruit that's half tangerine and half grapefruit is tangelo. That would make option C the right answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll eliminate the other options:\n\nOption A, graperine: Not a recognized fruit name.\n\nOption B, tangefruit: Seems invented and doesn't correspond to any known fruit.\n\nOption D, kumquat: A separate type of citrus fruit, not a tangerine-grapefruit hybrid.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is option C, tangelo.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
