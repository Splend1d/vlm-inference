                    "text": "So I have this question about introns, and I need to figure out which statement is not true about them. Let's see, introns are parts of DNA that don't code for proteins, right? But let me make sure I understand all the options.\n\nOption A says they occur only in eukaryotes. I thought that introns are mostly found in eukaryotes, but are there any prokaryotes that have introns? Maybe some bacteria or archaea have them, but I think it's mostly eukaryotes. So, probably A is true.\n\nOption B says they represent noncoding regions. Yeah, that makes sense. Introns are the parts that are spliced out from the RNA transcript before the mRNA is translated into a protein. So, they don't code for the polypeptide chain. That seems correct.\n\nOption C says they are found interspersed with exons on a region of DNA that codes for a polypeptide chain. That's what I remember about introns. They're located between the exons in the DNA sequence. So, this should be true as well.\n\nOption D says they are excised from the primary transcript before it gains a 5' cap and a 3' poly(A) tail. Hmm, I thought that capping and polyadenylation happen before splicing. Let me think about this. When RNA is processed in the nucleus, the 5' cap is added first, then the 3' poly(A) tail, and then splicing occurs to remove introns. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact timing of these events. Maybe splicing and capping happen concurrently or in a different order.\n\nLet me double-check. I recall that in eukaryotic pre-mRNA processing, the 5' cap is added almost immediately after transcription starts, and the poly(A) tail is added at the 3' end before splicing. But splicing can occur both before and after these modifications. Wait, no, I think splicing can happen co-transcriptionally, meaning while the RNA is being transcribed, and it can happen before or after capping and tailing, depending on the specific gene and the transcriptional speed.\n\nBut generally, in many cases, capping happens early, polyadenylation happens later, and splicing occurs in between. So, introns are excised after capping and before polyadenylation in some cases, or maybe even overlapping in time with these processes. But the statement in option D seems to suggest that introns are excised before the primary transcript gains a 5' cap and a 3' poly(A) tail, which might not be accurate in all cases.\n\nLet me see if I can find some information to clarify this. Upon checking, I find that capping occurs shortly after transcription begins, polyadenylation occurs at the end of transcription, and splicing can occur at various times in between. In some cases, splicing can happen before capping or polyadenylation, but it's not always the case. Maybe the sequence is: capping, splicing, then polyadenylation.\n\nWait, I found that capping happens early, splicing occurs during transcription, and polyadenylation at the end. So, introns are excised during splicing, which can be before polyadenylation but after capping. Does that mean that introns are excised before the primary transcript gains a 5' cap? No, because capping happens before splicing.\n\nSo, option D says introns are excised before the primary transcript gains a 5' cap and a 3' poly(A) tail. But according to my understanding, splicing can happen after capping but before polyadenylation. So, it's not entirely accurate to say that introns are excised before the primary transcript gains a 5' cap, because capping happens before splicing.\n\nTherefore, option D is not entirely true. Introns are excised during splicing, which occurs after capping but before polyadenylation in many cases. So, they are excised after the 5' cap is added, not before.\n\nTo confirm, introns are excised after capping and before polyadenylation in the processing of pre-mRNA. Therefore, the statement in option D is incorrect because introns are not excised before the primary transcript gains a 5' cap.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
