                    "text": "Let's see. So, I have this question about how the price of one good affects another good that's a close substitute. Specifically, if the price of good X increases, what happens to the equilibrium price and quantity of good Z, which is a close substitute for Z. The options are:\n\nA. The equilibrium price will rise and the equilibrium quantity will fall.\n\nB. The equilibrium price will fall and the equilibrium quantity will rise.\n\nC. The equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity will both rise.\n\nD. The equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity will both fall.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what a substitute good is. A substitute good is one that can be used instead of another good. So, if the price of good X goes up, people might switch to good Z because it's similar and perhaps now relatively cheaper.\n\nSo, if X and Z are substitutes, and the price of X increases, I would think that the demand for Z would increase because people would buy more Z instead of X. Right? Because Z is now a better deal comparatively.\n\nIf the demand for Z increases, what happens to the equilibrium price and quantity of Z?\n\nI remember from economics class that when demand increases, the demand curve shifts to the right. This leads to a new equilibrium where the price is higher and the quantity is also higher.\n\nWait, but let's think carefully. If demand increases, the demand curve shifts right. At the original price, there is now excess demand, which puts upward pressure on the price. As the price rises, the quantity supplied increases and the quantity demanded decreases until a new equilibrium is reached where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded at a higher price and higher quantity.\n\nSo, based on this, both the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity of Z should increase.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIs there any chance that the supply of Z could change in response to the price change in X? Well, unless the production of Z and X are related in some way, like using the same inputs or something, I don't think so. For now, I'll assume that the supply of Z remains unchanged, and only the demand changes due to the substitution effect.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium price and quantity of Z should both rise when the price of its close substitute X increases.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. The equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity will both rise.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption A says the equilibrium price will rise and the equilibrium quantity will fall. That would suggest a movement along the demand curve, but in this case, demand is increasing, so quantity should increase, not decrease.\n\nOption B says the equilibrium price will fall and the equilibrium quantity will rise. That would happen if supply increased, but we're assuming supply is constant.\n\nOption D says both will fall, which doesn't make sense in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but what if the supply of Z is affected by the price of X? For example, if X and Z share the same production inputs, maybe the higher price of X affects the availability or cost of those inputs, which could shift the supply curve of Z.\n\nHmm, that's a good point. But the question specifies that X is a close substitute for Z, not necessarily that they share production inputs. So, unless specified otherwise, I think it's safe to assume that only demand changes.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is C. The equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity will both rise.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
