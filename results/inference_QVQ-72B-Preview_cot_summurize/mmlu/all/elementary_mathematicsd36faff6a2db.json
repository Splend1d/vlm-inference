                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: the original price of a new bicycle is $138.00, and it's marked down by 15%. I need to find the new price. The options are A. $20.70, B. $117.30, C. $123.00, and D. $153.00.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what it means when something is marked down by 15%. I know that a markdown is a reduction in price, so if the original price is $138.00 and it's marked down by 15%, that means the price is being reduced by 15% of the original price.\n\nSo, I need to calculate 15% of $138.00 and then subtract that from the original price to find the new price.\n\nLet me recall how to calculate a percentage of a number. To find 15% of $138.00, I can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} \\times \\text{original price} = \\text{markdown amount}\n\\]\n\nBut since I'm dealing with money, I should make sure to keep the decimal points in place.\n\nLet me calculate 15% of $138.00 step by step.\n\nFirst, 15% is the same as 0.15 in decimal form.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n0.15 \\times 138 = \\text{markdown amount}\n\\]\n\nLet me do this multiplication.\n\nI can break it down:\n\n\\[\n0.15 \\times 138 = 0.15 \\times 100 + 0.15 \\times 30 + 0.15 \\times 8\n\\]\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n\\[\n0.15 \\times 100 = 15\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.15 \\times 30 = 4.5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.15 \\times 8 = 1.2\n\\]\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n\\[\n15 + 4.5 + 1.2 = 20.7\n\\]\n\nSo, the markdown amount is $20.70.\n\nNow, to find the new price, I need to subtract the markdown amount from the original price.\n\n\\[\n\\text{new price} = \\text{original price} - \\text{markdown amount} = 138 - 20.7 = ?\n\\]\n\nLet me do this subtraction carefully.\n\n\\[\n138.00\n\\]\n\\[\n- 20.70\n\\]\n\\[\n= 117.30\n\\]\n\nSo, the new price should be $117.30.\n\nLooking back at the options, that corresponds to option B. $117.30.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me check if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother method I've used before is to calculate the percentage of the original price that the new price represents. Since it's a 15% markdown, the new price is 85% of the original price.\n\n\\[\n\\text{new price} = \\frac{85}{100} \\times 138\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 85% is 0.85 in decimal form.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n0.85 \\times 138 = ?\n\\]\n\nAgain, breaking it down:\n\n\\[\n0.85 \\times 100 = 85\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.85 \\times 30 = 25.5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.85 \\times 8 = 6.8\n\\]\n\nAdding them up:\n\n\\[\n85 + 25.5 + 6.8 = 117.3\n\\]\n\nSo, again, the new price is $117.30.\n\nThis matches my previous calculation, which gives me confidence that I'm correct.\n\nLet me just double-check if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Is there any chance that the markdown affects taxes or anything like that? No, the problem seems straightforward: just a simple percentage markdown on the original price.\n\nAlso, sometimes people might get confused about whether the percentage is applied to the original price or to some other amount, but in this case, it's clearly stated that it's the original price being marked down by 15%.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the markdown is inclusive or exclusive of tax, but again, the problem doesn't mention any taxes, so I think it's safe to assume it's just a direct markdown on the original price.\n\nSo, after these calculations and cross-verifications, I'm confident that the correct answer is $117.30, which is option B.\n\nJust to make sure, let me see what the other options are and why they might be incorrect.\n\nOption A is $20.70, which is actually the markdown amount, not the new price. So, choosing this would be a mistake if I misremembered what the question was asking.\n\nOption C is $123.00. Let me see how this might have been calculated. Maybe someone added the markdown to the original price instead of subtracting it, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption D is $153.00, which seems higher than the original price, so that can't be right since it's a markdown, not a markup.\n\nTherefore, based on all this, the best answer is indeed B. $117.30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ \\$117.30} \\]"
