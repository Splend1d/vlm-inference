                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Substances whose Lewis structures must be drawn with an unpaired electron are called...\" and the options are A. ionic compounds, B. free radicals, C. resonance structures, D. polar molecules. Hmm, I need to figure out which one fits the description of having an unpaired electron in their Lewis structure.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand what a Lewis structure is. Lewis structures are diagrams that show the valence electrons of atoms in a molecule, using dots to represent the electrons. Pairs of electrons are often bonded together, forming bonds between atoms. But sometimes, there's an odd number of valence electrons in a molecule, which means there can't be pairs for all of them. That's what they're referring to here\u2014an unpaired electron.\n\nSo, I need to find the term that best describes substances that have this characteristic.\n\nLet's look at option A: ionic compounds. I know that ionic compounds are formed when one atom transfers an electron to another atom, resulting in ions that attract each other. For example, sodium chloride (NaCl) is an ionic compound where sodium gives up its one valence electron to chlorine, which needs one to complete its outer shell. In the resulting ions, Na+ and Cl-, the valence shells are filled, so I don't think there would be any unpaired electrons in their Lewis structures. Maybe not the right choice.\n\nOption B: free radicals. I've heard of free radicals in chemistry; they're species that have an unpaired electron. They're usually very reactive because of that unpaired electron and can cause damage in biological systems. So, according to this, free radicals are substances that have an unpaired electron in their Lewis structure. That sounds promising.\n\nOption C: resonance structures. Resonance is when a molecule can be represented by two or more Lewis structures that are equivalent and differ only in the placement of electrons. For example, ozone (O3) has two resonance structures with the double bonds alternating. But in both structures, all valence electrons are paired; there are no unpaired electrons. So, resonance structures don't necessarily have unpaired electrons.\n\nOption D: polar molecules. Polar molecules have a partial positive and negative charge due to the unequal distribution of electrons. Water (H2O) is a polar molecule because the oxygen atom pulls the electrons closer to itself, making it partially negative, and the hydrogen atoms are partially positive. But in water's Lewis structure, all valence electrons are paired\u2014oxygen has two lone pairs, and the hydrogens each have one electron shared with oxygen. So, no unpaired electrons there.\n\nHmm, based on this, it seems like option B, free radicals, is the correct choice because they specifically have an unpaired electron. But just to be sure, maybe I should think of some examples.\n\nLet's take nitrogen oxide (NO). It has an odd number of valence electrons: nitrogen has 5, oxygen has 6, total of 11 valence electrons. In its Lewis structure, there will be an unpaired electron. Yes, NO is a free radical. Another example is the hydroxyl radical (OH\u2022), which also has an unpaired electron on the oxygen atom.\n\nWait a minute, are all substances with unpaired electrons considered free radicals? I think so, but let me check if there are any exceptions or if this term applies only to certain types of molecules.\n\nI recall that free radicals can be neutral molecules, anions, or cations, as long as they have an unpaired electron. For example, the methyl radical (CH3\u2022) is a neutral free radical, while the sulfate radical (SO4\u2022-) is an anionic free radical.\n\nSo, it seems that the term \"free radical\" encompasses a wide range of substances that have an unpaired electron in their Lewis structure.\n\nNow, just to make sure, let's consider if any of the other options could possibly fit the description.\n\nIonic compounds (option A): as I thought earlier, they typically have complete octets and no unpaired electrons.\n\nResonance structures (option C): while resonance can involve lone pairs and bonding pairs shifting, it doesn't introduce unpaired electrons; it just redistributes the paired electrons.\n\nPolar molecules (option D): these have polar covalent bonds due to differences in electronegativity, but their Lewis structures still show all valence electrons paired.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is option B: free radicals.\n\nWait, but the question says \"substances whose Lewis structures must be drawn with an unpaired electron are called...\" and then gives the options. So, it's not necessarily about the common name for these substances, but specifically about how their Lewis structures are represented.\n\nIn that case, perhaps there's a more precise term related to Lewis structures with unpaired electrons.\n\nLet me think about the terminology used in Lewis structures. I know that molecules with an even number of valence electrons can usually be drawn with all electrons paired, forming bonds or lone pairs. However, molecules with an odd number of valence electrons must have at least one unpaired electron in their Lewis structure.\n\nThese substances are indeed referred to as free radicals. So, I think option B is the correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider another perspective. Maybe there's a different way to interpret the question.\n\nCould it be that the question is trying to ask about the formal classification of these substances based on their Lewis structures?\n\nFor example, perhaps in some contexts, these substances are considered to have resonance structures that include unpaired electrons.\n\nBut no, resonance structures are used when there are multiple valid Lewis structures for a molecule, differing only in the placement of pi bonds and lone pairs, and all valence electrons are paired.\n\nIn contrast, free radicals have an inherent unpaired electron that can't be paired in any Lewis structure.\n\nTherefore, option B remains the best choice.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps considering the molecular geometry or the hybridization of atoms in molecules with unpaired electrons.\n\nBut that seems unrelated to the question at hand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe thinking about magnetic properties: substances with unpaired electrons are paramagnetic, meaning they are attracted to magnetic fields.\n\nBut again, that doesn't directly correspond to any of the given options.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The straightforward answer is that substances with unpaired electrons in their Lewis structures are called free radicals.\n\nSo, the answer is B. free radicals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ free radicals}} \\]"
