                    "text": " Okay, I'm trying to understand this question about Pence's objections to the argument that SCNT isn't best for the child. So, first things first, SCNT stands for Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer, which is a technique used in cloning where the nucleus from a donor cell is transferred to an enucleated egg cell to create a cloned embryo. Now, the question is about objections to the argument that this method isn't in the best interests of the child.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. The argument assumes genetic determinism or genetic reductionism.\n\nB. The expectations people will place on SCNT individuals could be no worse than normal expectations of children created sexually.\n\nC. People's prejudicial attitudes are likely to change.\n\nD. If people's prejudicial attitudes do not change, then we should not allow SCNT.\n\nI need to figure out which one of these is not an objection Pence gives.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Pence is arguing. From what I recall, Mike Pence is known for his conservative views, particularly on bioethical issues like cloning and stem cell research. He has expressed concerns about the moral and ethical implications of SCNT.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: The argument assumes genetic determinism or genetic reductionism.\n\nGenetic determinism is the idea that genes solely determine an organism's traits and behaviors, ignoring environmental and other factors. Genetic reductionism is similar, suggesting that complex traits can be reduced to simple genetic explanations.\n\nIf Pence is criticizing an argument that says SCNT isn't best for the child because it assumes that the child's traits and behaviors are predetermined by their genes, that might be a point he makes. But I need to confirm.\n\nOption B: The expectations people will place on SCNT individuals could be no worse than normal expectations of children created sexually.\n\nThis seems to suggest that the worries about heightened expectations for SCNT children might not be significantly different from those placed on sexually reproduced children. If Pence is arguing that the expectations aren't necessarily worse in SCNT cases, that could be a point in favor of allowing SCNT.\n\nOption C: People's prejudicial attitudes are likely to change.\n\nThis seems to suggest that over time, societal prejudices against SCNT children would diminish, making it acceptable in the future.\n\nOption D: If people's prejudicial attitudes do not change, then we should not allow SCNT.\n\nThis is a conditional statement, saying that if prejudices remain, SCNT shouldn't be allowed.\n\nNow, considering Pence's positions, I recall that he has been critical of SCNT and cloning in general, citing moral and ethical concerns. He has expressed worries about the status of the cloned individual and the potential for exploitation or unfair treatment.\n\nIn a speech in 2001, Pence said, \"The very idea that we would clone human beings, create human beings for the purposes of destroying them, is morally bankrupt, and I believe it will be soundly rejected by the American people and by the Congress of the United States.\"\n\nThis indicates that he sees SCNT as morally problematic and potentially harmful to the cloned individual.\n\nGiven this background, it seems that Pence would be more aligned with concerns about genetic determinism or the potential for heightened expectations and prejudices against SCNT children.\n\nBut the question is asking which of these is not an objection Pence gives to the argument that SCNT is not best for the child.\n\nWait a minute, that's a bit tricky. The question is phrased to ask which of the following is not an objection Pence gives to the argument that SCNT is not best for the child. So, it's about what Pence doesn't object to in this particular argument.\n\nLet me rephrase it in my mind: among these options, which one does not represent an objection that Pence would make against the idea that SCNT is not in the child's best interest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to say: which of these is not a point that Pence would make in defense of SCNT being acceptable for the child?\n\nI think I need to clarify the question.\n\nUpon closer look, the question says: \"Which of the following is not an objection Pence gives to the argument that SCNT is not best for the child?\"\n\nSo, it's asking which of these options is not an objection that Pence would make against the argument that SCNT is not in the child's best interest.\n\nIn other words, which of these does Pence not use to defend SCNT being acceptable for the child?\n\nGiven that, I need to identify which option doesn't align with Pence's views on this issue.\n\nFrom what I know, Pence is generally opposed to SCNT on moral grounds, so he wouldn't be making arguments in defense of SCNT being in the child's best interest.\n\nTherefore, none of these options would be objections he gives to the argument against SCNT, because he agrees with the argument that SCNT is not best for the child.\n\nBut that can't be right, because the question is assuming that Pence does offer some objections to the argument against SCNT, and we're to pick the one he doesn't offer.\n\nPerhaps I need to think differently.\n\nMaybe Pence does offer some objections to certain aspects of the argument against SCNT, while still overall opposing SCNT.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nOption A says the argument assumes genetic determinism or genetic reductionism.\n\nIf Pence is arguing against SCNT, he might criticize the idea that genes determine the child's fate, perhaps to emphasize that environmental factors and parenting can mitigate any potential negative impacts of SCNT.\n\nWait, but if he's overall against SCNT, he might still acknowledge that genetic determinism is a concern, but that doesn't mean he's objecting to the argument against SCNT on those grounds.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nOption B says that expectations for SCNT individuals could be no worse than for sexually reproduced children.\n\nIf Pence is concerned about the welfare of SCNT children, he might argue that expectations could be higher or different, which could be detrimental to the child. So, he might not agree that expectations are no worse; in fact, he might think they are worse.\n\nTherefore, he wouldn't make the objection that expectations are no worse, because he believes they are worse.\n\nSo, option B could be a candidate for the answer.\n\nOption C: People's prejudicial attitudes are likely to change.\n\nIf Pence is worried about prejudices against SCNT children, he might argue that prejudices are unlikely to change quickly, and thus SCNT should not be allowed until society is ready.\n\nTherefore, he wouldn't make the objection that attitudes are likely to change, because he might think they aren't.\n\nSo, option C could also be a candidate.\n\nOption D: If people's prejudicial attitudes do not change, then we should not allow SCNT.\n\nThis seems like a position Pence might agree with, as it conditionally states that if prejudices remain, SCNT shouldn't be allowed. This aligns with his concern for the welfare of the child.\n\nTherefore, he might make this objection to the argument that SCNT is not best for the child by saying that as long as prejudices exist, it's not in the child's best interest to proceed with SCNT.\n\nSo, option D seems like something he would say.\n\nOption A suggests that the argument against SCNT assumes genetic determinism, which Pence might or might not agree with. I need to think more about this.\n\nIf Pence is arguing that SCNT is not in the child's best interest because of potential genetic issues or predetermined traits, he might be assuming some form of genetic determinism. However, he might also recognize that environment plays a significant role in the development of the child.\n\nGiven his conservative background, Pence might emphasize the importance of traditional family structures and parenting, which could imply that he believes environmental factors are crucial in shaping a child's outcome.\n\nTherefore, he might not fully embrace genetic determinism, making option A a possible objection he gives to the argument against SCNT.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased, it's asking which of these is not an objection Pence gives to the argument that SCNT is not best for the child.\n\nSo, if option A is an objection he gives to that argument, meaning he's saying that the argument against SCNT incorrectly assumes genetic determinism, then he's defending SCNT to some extent by critiquing the basis of the argument against it.\n\nBut given his overall opposition to SCNT, this seems contradictory.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that Pence might critique the argument against SCNT for relying on genetic determinism, not to defend SCNT, but to refine his own arguments against it.\n\nHowever, that seems convoluted.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nSuppose that the argument against SCNT being in the child's best interest is based on several points:\n\n1. Genetic determinism: The child's traits are predetermined by their genes, leading to a loss of individuality or free will.\n\n2. Heightened expectations: Parents or society may have unrealistic expectations for the SCNT child, based on the donor's traits.\n\n3. Prejudicial attitudes: Society may discriminate against SCNT children, seeing them as unnatural or inferior.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of the following is not an objection Pence gives to this argument.\n\nIn other words, which of these points does Pence not object to in the argument against SCNT being in the child's best interest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's asking which of these is not a criticism Pence makes of the argument against SCNT.\n\nThis is still confusing.\n\nLet me consider that Pence agrees with the argument that SCNT is not in the child's best interest, and the options are potential objections that others might raise to his argument, and we need to identify which one he doesn't consider a valid objection.\n\nIn that case, the question is: which of the following is not an objection that Pence gives to the argument that SCNT is not best for the child \u2013 meaning, which of these would Pence not use to defend his position against critics.\n\nGiven that, perhaps Pence would object to the idea that genetic determinism is assumed, arguing instead that the concerns are valid regardless of genetic determinism.\n\nSimilarly, he might object to the idea that expectations for SCNT children aren't worse than for sexually reproduced children, asserting that they are indeed worse.\n\nHe might also object to the idea that prejudicial attitudes are likely to change, arguing that they are deeply ingrained and unlikely to shift quickly.\n\nTherefore, the one that he wouldn't object to is option D: If people's prejudicial attitudes do not change, then we should not allow SCNT.\n\nThis aligns with his position, as he might agree that if prejudices remain, SCNT shouldn't be allowed, thus he wouldn't object to this point.\n\nWait, but the question is asking which is not an objection Pence gives to the argument that SCNT is not best for the child.\n\nOption D is more of a statement that aligns with his position, not an objection to the argument.\n\nTherefore, it doesn't fit the description.\n\nThis is getting too confusing.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the question in my mind.\n\nThe argument is: SCNT is not best for the child.\n\nPence agrees with this argument.\n\nNow, someone might object to this argument on various grounds, such as:\n\n- Objection A: The argument assumes genetic determinism, which is not necessarily true.\n\n- Objection B: Expectations for SCNT children might not be worse than for sexually reproduced children.\n\n- Objection C: Prejudicial attitudes are likely to change over time.\n\n- Objection D: If prejudicial attitudes don't change, then we shouldn't allow SCNT.\n\nNow, the question is: which of these objections is not one that Pence gives to the argument that SCNT is not best for the child.\n\nIn other words, which of these would Pence not use to defend his position against critics who say SCNT is not best for the child.\n\nGiven that, perhaps Pence would object to the idea that genetic determinism is assumed, arguing that the concerns about SCNT go beyond genetic determinism.\n\nSimilarly, he might object to the idea that expectations aren't worse for SCNT children, asserting that they are indeed under greater pressure.\n\nHe might also object to the idea that prejudicial attitudes are likely to change, given societal resistance to change.\n\nTherefore, the one he wouldn't object to is option D: If people's prejudicial attitudes do not change, then we should not allow SCNT.\n\nThis is because this statement aligns with his position; he would agree with it, not object to it.\n\nTherefore, it's not an objection he gives to the argument against SCNT being in the child's best interest.\n\nHence, the answer is D.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf Pence agrees that SCNT is not in the child's best interest due to potential prejudices, then he would agree with the conditional statement that if prejudices don't change, SCNT shouldn't be allowed.\n\nTherefore, he wouldn't object to that statement; rather, he would endorse it.\n\nThus, it's not an objection he gives to the argument against SCNT, but rather a reinforcement of his position.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
