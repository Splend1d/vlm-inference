The options are pretty spread out, so maybe I don't need to be super precise, but I should still think carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll just add 711 and 497 directly. Let me do that step by step.\n\n711 plus 497.\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n1 plus 7 is 8.\n\n11 plus 9 is 20, so carry over 2 to the hundreds place.\n\n7 plus 4 is 11, plus the carried over 2 makes 13.\n\nSo, 711 + 497 = 1208.\n\nAlright, so the exact sum is 1208.\n\nNow, I need to see which range this falls into from the given options:\n\nA. 50 and 400\n\nB. 450 and 700\n\nC. 750 and 1,000\n\nD. 1,050 and 1,300\n\nLooking at these, 1208 is bigger than all of them except D, which goes up to 1,300.\n\nWait, but D starts at 1,050 and goes to 1,300, and 1,208 is definitely within that range.\n\nSo, it seems like D is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding.\n\n711 + 497.\n\nLet me try a different method for verification.\n\nI can round 711 to 700 and 497 to 500. Adding those gives 1,200. Then, 711 is 11 more than 700, and 497 is 3 less than 500. So, overall, it's 1,200 plus 11 minus 3, which is 1,208. Okay, that matches my previous result.\n\nSo, again, 1,208 is within the range of 1,050 to 1,300.\n\nAre there any other ranges that could possibly include 1,208? Let's see:\n\nOption C is 750 to 1,000 \u2013 that's less than 1,208.\n\nOption B is 450 to 700 \u2013 even lower.\n\nOption A is 50 to 400 \u2013 no way.\n\nSo, only option D includes 1,208.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 1,050 and 1,300.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any tricks here; it seems straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
