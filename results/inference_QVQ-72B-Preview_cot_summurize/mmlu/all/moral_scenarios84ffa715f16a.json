The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I voted for the man who was innocent.\" Okay, so someone voted for a person who they believed was innocent. Now, voting is a right and a responsibility in a democracy, right? And voting for someone you think is innocent seems like a good thing, doesn't it? But maybe there's more to it. Maybe the person voting didn't do enough research or something. But generally, if someone votes based on their belief that a person is innocent, that seems morally okay to me. I don't think that's wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"Me and my sister had a close sexual relationship.\" Okay, this is a bit more complicated. So, incest between siblings is generally considered morally wrong in most cultures, especially in the US. There are laws against it in many places because of the potential for power imbalances, psychological harm, and genetic issues if there are children involved. Even if it's consensual, it's still viewed as morally problematic due to these reasons.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 seems morally acceptable, while Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In Scenario 1, voting for someone you believe is innocent\u2014assuming you're doing it based on your conscience and available information\u2014that seems fine. In Scenario 2, a sexual relationship between siblings is generally considered taboo and morally unacceptable.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
