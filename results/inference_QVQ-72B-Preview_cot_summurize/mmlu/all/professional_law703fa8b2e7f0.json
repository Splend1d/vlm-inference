                    "text": "So I've got this contract law scenario here, and I need to figure out who's liable for what. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, on February 1, a homeowner hires a famous landscape architect to landscape her five-acre estate. The architect promises to finish the job by May 30, which is before her annual garden party. Cool, so there's a contract between the homeowner and the architect.\n\nThen, on March 1, the homeowner goes on vacation for a month. While she's away, the architect assigns the contract to a gardener. The homeowner doesn't know about this assignment. The gardener does 60% of the work, and when the homeowner comes back, she's not happy with what's been done. She contacts the architect, who tells her that he assigned the contract to the gardener and that he's not obligated under the original contract anymore. The homeowner fires the gardener and is now considering a claim against the architect for breach of contract.\n\nThe question is, considering this scenario, will the fact that the architect assigned the contract to the gardener relieve the architect of liability? The options are:\n\nA. Relieve the architect of liability because the contract was assignable.\n\nB. Relieve the architect of liability because the gardener's work was the cause of the homeowner's dissatisfaction.\n\nC. Not relieve the architect of liability because a personal service contract of this nature is non-delegable.\n\nD. Not relieve the architect of liability unless there was an express contractual provision against assignments.\n\nAlright, let's analyze this.\n\nFirst, what does it mean to assign a contract? Assignment is when one party transfers their rights under a contract to another party. But obligations under a contract can also be delegated to another party. However, there are limitations to assignment and delegation, especially when the contract involves personal services.\n\nIn this case, the architect is a famous landscape architect, and the homeowner likely hired him based on his reputation and the work he did for her neighbor. So, the contract is probably for his personal services.\n\nNow, generally, contracts for personal services are not assignable or delegable without the consent of the other party because the essence of the contract is the personal skill, talent, or trust in the individual performing the service.\n\nSo, if the architect assigns the contract to a gardener without the homeowner's consent, that assignment might not be valid, especially if the contract was for his personal services.\n\nMoreover, if the homeowner is dissatisfied with the gardener's work, and the architect had promised to personally oversee or perform the landscaping, then the architect may still be liable for breaching the contract.\n\nLet's see what the options say.\n\nOption A says that the assignment will relieve the architect of liability because the contract was assignable. But based on what I just thought, if it's a personal service contract, it might not be assignable without consent. So, this seems iffy.\n\nOption B says that it will relieve the architect of liability because the gardener's work was the cause of the homeowner's dissatisfaction. But if the architect was supposed to perform the service personally and instead delegated it without consent, he might still be responsible for the performance. So, this might not be correct.\n\nOption C says that it will not relieve the architect of liability because a personal service contract of this nature is non-delegable. This seems to align with what I was thinking. Personal service contracts are often non-delegable because the party hiring wants the specific skills or trust in the person contracted.\n\nOption D says that it will not relieve the architect of liability unless there was an express contractual provision against assignments. This seems contradictory. If there's an express provision against assignments, then the assignment would be invalid, and the architect would still be liable. But if there's no such provision, then maybe the architect could assign the contract. But considering it's a personal service contract, even without an express prohibition, assignment might not be allowed.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is Option C: not relieve the architect of liability because a personal service contract of this nature is non-delegable.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nI recall that in contract law, contracts that require personal skills or trust in the individual are generally not delegable without consent. This makes sense because the party relying on the service wants that specific person's work.\n\nIn this case, the homeowner likely hired the famous landscape architect because of his reputation and previous work. So, she probably expected him to personally oversee or perform the work, not pass it off to someone else without her knowledge.\n\nTherefore, even if the contract didn't explicitly prohibit assignment, the nature of the contract as a personal service contract would likely make any assignment without consent invalid.\n\nSo, if the homeowner sues the architect for breach of contract, the architect cannot use the assignment to the gardener as a defense because the assignment was invalid in the first place.\n\nHence, the architect remains liable for breaching the contract by not completing the work to the homeowner's satisfaction, as per their agreement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not relieve the architect of liability because a personal service contract of this nature is non-delegable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
