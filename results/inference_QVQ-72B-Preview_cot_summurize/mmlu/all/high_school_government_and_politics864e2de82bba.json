It's asking which amendment was violated by the \"separate but equal\" doctrine that was established in Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896. The options are the First Amendment, Sixth Amendment, Ninth Amendment, or the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Brown v. Board of Education was about. I remember that it was a landmark Supreme Court case that declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students to be unconstitutional. This case overturned the \"separate but equal\" doctrine that had been established in Plessy v. Ferguson.\n\nNow, Plessy v. Ferguson introduced the idea that separate facilities for blacks and whites were constitutional as long as they were equal. But in practice, the facilities for black people were often inferior, which led to inequalities in education, transportation, and other areas.\n\nSo, in Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court ruled that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal, violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Fourteenth Amendment was adopted after the Civil War to address the rights of formerly enslaved people. It includes several sections, but the most relevant here is the Equal Protection Clause, which states that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\nGiven that, it seems clear that the amendment violated by the \"separate but equal\" doctrine is the Fourteenth Amendment, specifically the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nJust to make sure, let's quickly look at what the other amendments do:\n\n- The First Amendment protects freedom of religion, speech, peaceful assembly, and the freedom to petition the government.\n\n- The Sixth Amendment guarantees the rights of a person accused of a crime, including the right to a speedy and public trial, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, to be confronted with the witnesses against them, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in their favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for their defense.\n\n- The Ninth Amendment states that the enumeration of certain rights in the Constitution does not deny or disparage other retained rights of the people.\n\nNone of these amendments directly relate to the issue of segregation in public schools or the \"separate but equal\" doctrine.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
