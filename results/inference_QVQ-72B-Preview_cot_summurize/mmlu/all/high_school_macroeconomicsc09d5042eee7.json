                    "text": "So I have this question about the Federal Reserve System in the United States. It says: \"The FED's Board of Governors has members each serving -year terms.\" And there are four options to choose from:\n\nA. 14 7\n\nB. 7 14\n\nC. 8 8\n\nD. 50 2\n\nI need to figure out which of these is correct. I'm a bit rusty on the specifics of the Fed's structure, but I remember that the Board of Governors is an important part of the Fed, and its members serve long terms to ensure stability and independence from short-term political pressures.\n\nFirst, I should recall how many members are on the Board of Governors. I think there are seven members, but I might be wrong. Let me verify that. Yes, I believe the Board consists of seven members, each appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nNow, regarding their terms, I recall that they serve lengthy terms to maintain continuity and independence in monetary policy. I think the terms are 14 years, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact details.\n\nWait a minute, option A is 14 7, which might suggest that there are 14 members serving 7-year terms. But that doesn't seem right because I thought there were only seven members. Maybe the numbers are reversed.\n\nOption B is 7 14, which would suggest seven members serving 14-year terms. That sounds more familiar and aligns with what I think I know about the Fed's structure.\n\nOption C is 8 8, which would indicate eight members serving 8-year terms. I don't remember the Fed having eight members, so this seems unlikely.\n\nOption D is 50 2, which would imply 50 members serving 2-year terms. That seems way too many members and too short of terms for a central bank like the Fed, which is known for its independence and long-term planning.\n\nSo, between options A, B, and C, option B seems the most plausible. But to be sure, I should double-check my knowledge.\n\nLet me consider the purpose of the Board of Governors. It oversees the Federal Reserve System and implements monetary policy. The members are intended to serve staggered terms to ensure policy continuity over time and to insulate them from political cycles.\n\nI recall that the terms are quite long, probably 14 years, and that new members are appointed every two years to stagger the terms. So, if there are seven members, each serving a 14-year term, that would make sense because 14 divided by 2 is 7, meaning every two years, one member's term expires.\n\nWait, that doesn't quite add up. If there are seven members and terms are 14 years, but appointments are made every two years, that would mean each term is staggered by two years. So, yes, over 14 years, there would be seven terms, each starting two years apart.\n\nOption A is 14 7, which could be interpreted as 14 members serving 7-year terms, but that doesn't match what I know about the Fed's structure.\n\nOption B is 7 14, which aligns with seven members serving 14-year terms.\n\nOption C is 8 8, which doesn't match my understanding of the Fed's board composition.\n\nOption D is 50 2, which is clearly incorrect for the reasons I mentioned earlier.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. 7 14, meaning there are seven members each serving 14-year terms.\n\nJust to confirm, I'll recall that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System consists of seven members, each appointed for a 14-year term, with terms staggered so that one term expires every two years. This structure helps ensure that the board is not subject to short-term political influences and maintains a long-term perspective on monetary policy.\n\nSo, I'm confident that option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
