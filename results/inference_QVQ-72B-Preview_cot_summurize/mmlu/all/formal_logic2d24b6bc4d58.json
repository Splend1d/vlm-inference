                    "text": "Let's tackle this logic problem. So, we have this statement: \"Some firefighters rescue victims from danger.\" And we're given some predicates:\n\n- D(x): x is danger\n\n- F(x): x is a firefighter\n\n- V(x): x is a victim\n\n- R(x,y,z): x rescues y from z\n\nAnd we need to translate this statement into predicate logic from the given options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"some firefighters rescue victims from danger\" means in logical terms. \"Some\" means at least one, but possibly more. So, it's an existential quantifier for firefighters.\n\nSo, \u2203x F(x) ... and then, for this firefighter x, it rescues victims from danger.\n\nNow, victims and danger are other entities, so they also need to be quantified.\n\nThe statement says \"rescue victims from danger,\" which suggests that for a given firefighter, there exists at least one victim and one danger that the firefighter rescues the victim from that danger.\n\nSo, for a firefighter x, there exists a victim y and a danger z such that R(x,y,z).\n\nPutting it together, it should be:\n\n\u2203x (F(x) \u2227 \u2203y (V(y) \u2227 \u2203z (D(z) \u2227 R(x,y,z))))\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. (\u2203x){Fx \u2022 (\u2200y)[Dy \u2283 (\u2203z)(Vz \u2022 Rxyz)]}\n\nThis seems to say that there exists a firefighter x such that for all y, if y is danger, then there exists a z that is a victim and x rescues y from z. Hmm, that seems different. It's saying that for every danger, there's a victim that the firefighter rescues from that danger. That's not what the original statement says. The original says that some firefighters rescue victims from danger, but not necessarily from every danger.\n\nB. (\u2203x){Fx \u2022 (\u2203y)[Vy \u2022 (\u2203z)(Dz \u2022 Rxyz)]}\n\nThis says that there exists a firefighter x such that there exists a victim y and a danger z, and x rescues y from z. This seems to match our earlier analysis. It says that some firefighters rescue at least one victim from at least one danger.\n\nC. (\u2203x){Fx \u2022 (\u2203y)(\u2203z)[(Vy \u2022 Dz) \u2022 Rxzy]}\n\nThis is similar to option B, but the order of variables in R is different. It has R(x,z,y), which would mean x rescues z from y. That doesn't match the original statement, which says \"rescue victims from danger.\" Victims should be associated with y, and danger with z.\n\nD. (\u2200x){Fx \u2283 (\u2203y)[Vy . (\u2203z)(Dz \u2022 Rxyz)]}\n\nThis is a universal quantifier for firefighters. It says that for all x, if x is a firefighter, then there exists a victim y and a danger z such that x rescues y from z. This would mean that every firefighter rescues at least one victim from at least one danger. But the original statement says \"some firefighters,\" not all.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option B seems to be the correct translation of the statement \"some firefighters rescue victims from danger.\"\n\nJust to double-check:\n\nOption B: (\u2203x){Fx \u2022 (\u2203y)[Vy \u2022 (\u2203z)(Dz \u2022 Rxyz)]}\n\n- \u2203x: there exists at least one firefighter x\n\n- Fx: x is a firefighter\n\n- \u2203y: there exists at least one victim y\n\n- Vy: y is a victim\n\n- \u2203z: there exists at least one danger z\n\n- Dz: z is a danger\n\n- Rxyz: x rescues y from z\n\nYes, this matches the original statement perfectly.\n\nOption A is different because it has a universal quantifier for y, which is dangers, implying that for every danger, there's a victim that the firefighter rescues from that danger. That's stronger than the original statement.\n\nOption C has the wrong order in R, swapping y and z.\n\nOption D requires that all firefighters rescue victims from danger, which is not what the original statement claims.\n\nTherefore, the best translation is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
