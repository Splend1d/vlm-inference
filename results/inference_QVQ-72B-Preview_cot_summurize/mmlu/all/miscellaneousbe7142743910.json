Inca, D. Apache. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these civilizations was based in the Andes Mountains and was conquered by the Spanish in 1532.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Andes Mountains are in South America, right? So, let's think about the geographical locations of these civilizations.\n\nStarting with the Pueblo people, I believe they are indigenous peoples of the American Southwest, like in Arizona and New Mexico. That's not South America; that's North America. So, option A seems unlikely.\n\nNext, the Aztec Empire. I recall that the Aztecs were a Mesoamerican civilization, also in Central Mexico. Again, that's North America, not South America. So, option B is probably not the correct answer.\n\nNow, the Inca. I think the Inca Empire was located in South America, centered in present-day Peru. They were known for building an extensive empire along the Andes Mountains. And I seem to remember that the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro conquered the Inca Empire in 1532. That sounds promising, so option C is looking good.\n\nLastly, the Apache tribe. They are another indigenous group from North America, primarily in the southwestern United States. Again, that's not South America, so option D is also unlikely.\n\nSo, based on this, the Inca were the people who ruled the Andes Mountains until they were conquered by the Spanish in 1532. Let me just double-check this information to be sure.\n\nI know that the Inca Empire, also known as Tahuantinsuyu, was the largest empire in pre-Columbian America. It was located in the Andes Mountain range of South America, covering modern-day Peru, Bolivia, northern Chile, southwest Ecuador, and southwest Colombia. The capital of the Inca Empire was Cusco, in present-day Peru.\n\nThe Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire began in 1532 when Francisco Pizarro led a small force of about 180 Spanish soldiers to Cajamarca, where they captured the Inca emperor Atahualpa. This event marked the start of the conquest, which ultimately led to the fall of the Inca Empire.\n\nGiven this information, it's clear that the Inca were the rulers of the Andes Mountains until their conquest by the Spanish in 1532.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C.
