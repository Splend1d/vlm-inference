                    "text": "So I've got this equation here: v minus 26 equals 68. I need to solve for v, and there are four options to choose from. Let me see... option A is -42, B is 42, C is 94, and D is 88. Hmm, I need to find out which one of these is the correct answer.\n\nAlright, starting with the equation: v \u2212 26 = 68. I think the goal here is to isolate v, right? So, if I add 26 to both sides of the equation, that should cancel out the minus 26 on the left side. Let's try that.\n\nv \u2212 26 + 26 = 68 + 26\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\nv = 94\n\nSo, according to this calculation, the answer should be 94. But wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I did something wrong.\n\nLet me write it again: v \u2212 26 = 68. If I add 26 to both sides, it's v = 68 + 26. Let me add 68 and 26. 68 plus 26... 60 plus 20 is 80, and 8 plus 6 is 14, so 94. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about subtracting 68 from both sides to solve for v. Wait, let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with v \u2212 26 = 68, I can add 26 to both sides, which is what I did before, or I can subtract 68 from both sides to get v \u2212 26 \u2212 68 = 0. Then, v \u2212 94 = 0, so v = 94. Okay, that confirms my previous result.\n\nI think 94 is the correct answer. But just to be sure, maybe I should plug in the values to see which one satisfies the equation.\n\nLet's try option A: v = -42.\n\nPlug into equation: -42 \u2212 26 = -68. But the equation is v \u2212 26 = 68, so -68 \u2260 68. This is not correct.\n\nOption B: v = 42.\n\n42 \u2212 26 = 16 \u2260 68. Not correct.\n\nOption C: v = 94.\n\n94 \u2212 26 = 68. Yes, that matches the equation.\n\nOption D: v = 88.\n\n88 \u2212 26 = 62 \u2260 68. Not correct.\n\nSo, clearly, option C, which is 94, is the correct answer. I must have done everything right in my calculations.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps I can think about the relationship between the numbers.\n\nIf v \u2212 26 = 68, then v is 68 more than 26. So, v = 68 + 26. Again, that's 94.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the distance on a number line. Starting from 26, and v is 68 units away in the positive direction. So, 26 + 68 = 94.\n\nOr, if I think about it in terms of algebraic manipulation, I could write it as v = 68 + 26, which is the same as before.\n\nI think I've confirmed it multiple ways, and each time I end up with v = 94. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure there isn't any trick here, let me consider if there's any other interpretation of the equation.\n\nIs there any possibility that the equation v \u2212 26 = 68 could be interpreted differently? For example, could there be negative numbers involved in a way that changes the outcome? Well, subtracting a positive number from v gives us 68, and since 68 is positive, v must be greater than 26. So, negative numbers aren't relevant here.\n\nAlso, all the options provided are positive numbers, so I don't need to consider negatives in this context.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the equation is linear or involves higher degrees. But since it's a simple linear equation, solving for v directly is straightforward.\n\nI think I've covered all the possible angles here, and each time, v = 94 is the solution that fits.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 94.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
