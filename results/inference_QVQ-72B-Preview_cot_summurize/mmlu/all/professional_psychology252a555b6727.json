Let's break down each option.\n\nOption A says that program evaluation questions are often identified through the needs of a program\u2019s staff and stakeholders, while traditional research questions are identified by researchers using previous, existing research. That makes sense because program evaluations are usually geared towards specific programs and their immediate needs, whereas traditional research is more about building on existing knowledge and theories.\n\nOption B claims that program evaluation uses unique quantitative and qualitative methodologies that are different from those used in traditional research. Hmm, I thought that both program evaluation and traditional research could use similar methods. For instance, both might use surveys, interviews, or statistical analyses. Maybe this is the one that's not true.\n\nBut let me think again. Perhaps program evaluation does use some unique methods tailored to assessing specific programs, but generally, the methodologies seem quite similar to those in traditional research. So, maybe this statement is not entirely accurate.\n\nOption C states that traditional research and program evaluation have different aims. Traditional research aims to test existing theories and discover generalizable knowledge, while program evaluation aims to collect information important for timely decision-making. This seems right. Traditional research is more about contributing to a body of knowledge, while program evaluation is about providing practical information to improve or assess a specific program.\n\nOption D says that both traditional research and program evaluation may incorporate rigorous and systematic ways of collecting data to address their aims. That also sounds correct. Both approaches value accuracy and reliability in their data collection methods.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option B seems to be the one that's not entirely true. Program evaluation and traditional research share many of the same quantitative and qualitative methodologies, rather than using entirely unique methods.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there are some methods that are unique to program evaluation. For example, maybe some participatory evaluation techniques involve stakeholders in the evaluation process in ways that aren't common in traditional research. But even then, traditional research can also involve participatory methods, like action research.\n\nI think the key difference isn't so much about the methods themselves but about how they're applied and for what purpose. So, perhaps it's more accurate to say that both can use similar methods but apply them differently based on their objectives.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to suggest that program evaluation uses methods that are distinct from traditional research, which isn't necessarily the case. So, I would say that option B is not true.\n\nJust to summarize:\n\n- Option A: Differences in how questions are identified \u2013 seems accurate.\n\n- Option B: Unique methodologies in program evaluation \u2013 not necessarily true, as methods can be similar to traditional research.\n\n- Option C: Different aims \u2013 correct.\n\n- Option D: Both use rigorous data collection \u2013 accurate.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
