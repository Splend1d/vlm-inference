The options are social plan, social strategy, social audit, and social account. Hmm, let's see which one fits best.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what each term means in the context of organizations.\n\nStarting with a social plan: I think a social plan is more about setting goals and actions to achieve certain social objectives. It's like a roadmap for how an organization intends to make a positive impact socially. But the question is about assessing and demonstrating benefits and limitations, which sounds more like evaluation rather than planning.\n\nNext, social strategy. This seems similar to a social plan. Strategy is about deciding what to do and how to do it to achieve specific outcomes. Again, this is more about decision-making and implementation rather than evaluation.\n\nThen there's social account. This sounds a bit vague. In accounting, there's something called social accounting, which involves measuring and reporting the social and environmental impacts of an organization's activities. But \"social account\" isn't a term I'm familiar with in this context. Maybe it's not the right choice here.\n\nLastly, social audit. This rings a bell. An audit is generally a formal examination of something to check its validity, accuracy, or performance. A social audit would involve evaluating an organization's social, economic, and environmental impacts to understand and report on its benefits and limitations.\n\nLet me double-check this. If a social audit is a process where an organization systematically assesses its own social performance, that would align perfectly with the description in the question. It's a way for them to measure and demonstrate their impact in various areas, including social, economic, and environmental spheres.\n\nComparing it back to the other options:\n\n- Social plan: More about planning and less about evaluation.\n\n- Social strategy: Also about planning and decision-making.\n\n- Social account: Not a standard term for this purpose.\n\n- Social audit: Exactly matches the description of assessing and demonstrating impacts.\n\nI think the answer is clear. The term is social audit.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other context that might make another option more suitable. For example, maybe in certain industries, one of the other terms is used for evaluation purposes. But generally speaking, audit is the standard term for evaluation and reporting of impacts.\n\nAdditionally, social accounting is a related concept but it's more about the process of collecting and reporting social and environmental data. An audit, on the other hand, involves verifying the accuracy and completeness of these data and assessing the organization's performance based on them.\n\nSo, even if social accounting is about measuring impacts, the audit goes a step further by evaluating the effectiveness and providing a formal report.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate term for the process described in the question is social audit.\n\nI believe the correct answer is C. Social audit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
