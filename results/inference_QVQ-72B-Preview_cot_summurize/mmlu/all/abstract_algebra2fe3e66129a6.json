                    "text": "So I have this problem here. There's a set A with elements {1, 2, 3, 4}, and there's a relation ~ defined on this set, which includes the pairs (1,2), (1,3), and (4,2). The question is asking which properties this relation has from the options: not anti-symmetric, transitive, reflexive, or symmetric.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these terms means in the context of relations.\n\n1. **Reflexive**: A relation is reflexive if every element is related to itself. That means for all a in A, (a, a) is in the relation.\n\n2. **Symmetric**: A relation is symmetric if whenever (a, b) is in the relation, then (b, a) is also in the relation.\n\n3. **Anti-symmetric**: A relation is anti-symmetric if whenever (a, b) and (b, a) are in the relation, then a must be equal to b.\n\n4. **Transitive**: A relation is transitive if whenever (a, b) and (b, c) are in the relation, then (a, c) is also in the relation.\n\nGiven the relation ~ = {(1,2), (1,3), (4,2)}, I need to check each property.\n\n**Checking Reflexivity:**\n\nFor ~ to be reflexive, every element in A must be related to itself. That means (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), and (4,4) should be in ~. But looking at ~, we only have (1,2), (1,3), and (4,2). None of the pairs are of the form (a,a). Therefore, ~ is not reflexive.\n\n**Checking Symmetry:**\n\nFor ~ to be symmetric, if (a,b) is in ~, then (b,a) must also be in ~.\n\n- (1,2) is in ~, but (2,1) is not present.\n\n- (1,3) is in ~, but (3,1) is not present.\n\n- (4,2) is in ~, but (2,4) is not present.\n\nSince none of the reverse pairs are present, ~ is not symmetric.\n\n**Checking Anti-symmetry:**\n\nFor ~ to be anti-symmetric, if both (a,b) and (b,a) are in ~, then a must equal b.\n\nLooking at ~ = {(1,2), (1,3), (4,2)}:\n\n- There are no pairs where both (a,b) and (b,a) are present. For example:\n\n- (1,2) is in ~, but (2,1) is not.\n\n- (1,3) is in ~, but (3,1) is not.\n\n- (4,2) is in ~, but (2,4) is not.\n\nSince there are no cases where both (a,b) and (b,a) are present, the condition for anti-symmetry is vacuously true. Therefore, ~ is anti-symmetric, which means it's not \"not anti-symmetric.\"\n\n**Checking Transitivity:**\n\nFor ~ to be transitive, if (a,b) and (b,c) are in ~, then (a,c) must also be in ~.\n\nLooking at ~ = {(1,2), (1,3), (4,2)}:\n\n- Look for sequences like (a,b) and (b,c):\n\n- (1,2) and (4,2): are (1,2) and (4,2) in ~? Yes, but there's no (1,4) or anything like that.\n\n- (1,3) and ... there's no other pair that starts with 3.\n\n- (4,2) and (1,2): (4,2) and (1,2) are in ~, but there's no (4,1).\n\n- Also, check if there are any indirect relations.\n\n- Wait, let's list all possible pairs:\n\n- From (1,2) and (1,3): no common element.\n\n- From (1,2) and (4,2): no common element in the way that would lead to transitivity.\n\n- From (1,3) and (4,2): no common element.\n\n- So, there are no cases where (a,b) and (b,c) are both in ~ for some a, b, c in A.\n\n- Therefore, the condition for transitivity is vacuously true, meaning ~ is transitive.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Not reflexive.\n\n- Not symmetric.\n\n- Anti-symmetric.\n\n- Transitive.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. not anti-symmetric\n\nB. transitive\n\nC. reflexive\n\nD. symmetric\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct choice is B. transitive. However, the question seems to suggest selecting multiple options, but since it's phrased as \"then ~ is\", it might expect selecting all that apply. But given that only transitive applies, B is the answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider if there are any other properties that apply. Let's double-check.\n\n- Reflexivity: No, because no (a,a) pairs are present.\n\n- Symmetry: No, because (1,2) exists but not (2,1), etc.\n\n- Anti-symmetry: Yes, because there are no conflicting pairs.\n\n- Transitivity: Yes, because there are no counterexamples.\n\nTherefore, the relation is transitive, and the correct option is B.\n\nBut the question is phrased a bit strangely, as it includes \"not anti-symmetric\" as option A, but in this case, since ~ is anti-symmetric, it's not \"not anti-symmetric.\"\n\nOption D is symmetric, which we determined is not the case.\n\nOption C is reflexive, which is not true.\n\nOption A is \"not anti-symmetric,\" but since ~ is anti-symmetric, it shouldn't be selected.\n\nTherefore, the only correct option is B. transitive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
