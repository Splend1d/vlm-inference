                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to write 4 and 4 over 5 as an improper fraction. Okay, so first things first, I need to understand what an improper fraction is. It's a fraction where the numerator is larger than the denominator, right? So, something like 5/3 or 7/4, stuff like that.\n\nNow, 4 and 4 over 5 looks like a mixed number. That means there's a whole number part and a fractional part. So, it's 4 wholes and then another 4/5. I need to combine these into a single improper fraction.\n\nTo do that, I think I need to convert the whole number into fractions that have the same denominator as the fractional part. So, since the fractional part is 4/5, the denominator is 5, and the whole number is 4.\n\nLet me try to express 4 as a fraction with a denominator of 5. To do that, I need to find out what 4 wholes would be in terms of fifths. Since one whole is equal to 5/5, then 4 wholes would be 4 times 5/5, which is 20/5.\n\nSo, 4 is the same as 20/5. Now, I have both parts as fractions with the same denominator: 20/5 and 4/5.\n\nTo combine them, I just add the numerators together, keeping the denominator the same. So, 20 plus 4 is 24, and the denominator remains 5. Therefore, 4 and 4 over 5 as an improper fraction is 24 over 5.\n\nLet me double-check that. Starting with 4 and 4/5, converting 4 to 20/5, adding 4/5 to it, which gives 24/5. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to do this? Maybe by using multiplication or something else? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as 4 plus 4/5. So, 4 plus 4/5. To write this as a single fraction, I can express 4 as 4/1, and then add 4/5. But I think the first way is simpler because it directly converts the whole number to the same denominator as the fraction.\n\nAnother way might be to consider the mixed number as a sum and then find a common denominator, but that seems a bit more complicated for this problem.\n\nSo, based on my calculation, the answer should be 24 over 5.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 28 over 5\n\nB. 4 over 5\n\nC. 24 over 5\n\nD. 20 over 5\n\nSo, option C is 24 over 5, which matches my answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation. For example, could \"4 and 4 over 5\" be interpreted differently in some contexts?\n\nWell, in standard mathematical notation, \"and\" typically means addition, so 4 and 4/5 should be interpreted as 4 plus 4/5, which is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes in verbal descriptions, people might say \"4 and 4 over 5\" to mean \"four and four-fifths,\" which is still 4 + 4/5. So, I don't think there's another common interpretation.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 24 over 5.\n\nJust to make sure, perhaps I can visualize it. If I have 4 whole units and I divide each into 5 equal parts, then 4 wholes would be 20 parts, and adding another 4 parts would make it 24 parts in total, which is indeed 24/5.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. So, final answer is 24 over 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{24}{5}} \\]"
