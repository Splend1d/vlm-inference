The homeowner agreed to pay $25,000 for the contractor to renovate her kitchen, and the work was supposed to be done \"subject to the homeowner's complete personal satisfaction.\" That sounds like a pretty strong condition, right? It means the homeowner has to be totally happy with the work before she has to pay the full amount.\n\nThe contractor did the work: replaced the cabinets, flooring, and countertops. Then, when it came time to pay, the homeowner gave only $20,000 instead of the full $25,000. She said she didn't like the finish on the cabinets and wasn't satisfied. Now, the contractor is thinking about suing the homeowner for the remaining $5,000. The question is, will the contractor likely win this lawsuit?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. No, because a condition to the homeowner's obligation to pay was not satisfied.\n\nB. No, because the contractor breached his duty of good faith and fair dealing by supplying unsatisfactory materials.\n\nC. Yes, because the homeowner breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by rejecting the cabinets without justification.\n\nD. Yes, because the homeowner was the first party to breach the contract.\n\nHmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the contract says the work is subject to the homeowner's complete personal satisfaction. That seems like the homeowner has a lot of power here because her personal satisfaction is key. But, in contract law, there's a concept called the \"satisfaction clause.\" If the clause is subjective, meaning it's based on personal taste or feeling, then the homeowner can decide whether she's satisfied or not. However, this can't be used arbitrarily or in bad faith.\n\nThe homeowner paid $20,000 but withheld $5,000 because she didn't like the finish on the cabinets. She was truthful in her reason, saying she wasn't satisfied with the finish. So, on the surface, it seems like she's exercising her right under the contract to withhold payment if she's not satisfied.\n\nBut, there's more to it. The concept of \"complete personal satisfaction\" is very broad. It could cover anything from the actual quality of work to personal taste. However, courts often look at whether the dissatisfaction is reasonable or if it's being used to leverage a better deal or to avoid payment unfairly.\n\nOption A says no, because the condition wasn't satisfied. But is that the whole story? Maybe not. There might be limits to how the homeowner can interpret \"complete personal satisfaction.\" Maybe the contractor can argue that the finish on the cabinets is acceptable and that the homeowner's dissatisfaction isn't justified.\n\nOption B says no, because the contractor breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing by supplying unsatisfactory materials. But wait, the homeowner is the one who's dissatisfied, not necessarily because the materials are objectively bad, but because she doesn't like the finish. So, it's not clear that the contractor breached good faith by supplying unsatisfactory materials. The materials might be perfectly fine; it's just that the homeowner doesn't like the finish.\n\nOption C says yes, because the homeowner breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by rejecting the cabinets without justification. This seems interesting. If the homeowner's dissatisfaction isn't based on a legitimate issue with the workmanship or materials, but rather on a trivial or capricious reason, then the contractor might argue that the homeowner is acting in bad faith.\n\nOption D says yes, because the homeowner was the first to breach the contract. But was there a breach? The homeowner paid $20,000, which is part of the contract price, but not the full amount. Is that a breach, or is it an attempt to withhold payment for unsatisfactory work?\n\nI think the key here is whether the homeowner's dissatisfaction is justified. If the finish on the cabinets is genuinely poor or not as agreed, then her withholding of payment might be justified. However, if the finish is fine but she just doesn't like it personally, that might not be enough to withhold payment, especially if the contract was clear about the scope of work and the materials to be used.\n\nMaybe there's an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the contract, which would require both parties to act reasonably. If the homeowner is using her personal satisfaction in an unreasonable manner, the contractor could argue that she's breaching this covenant.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose the contractor did everything correctly according to the contract, used the agreed materials, and the workmanship is of standard quality. If the homeowner still isn't satisfied just because she doesn't like the finish, is that enough to withhold payment? Probably not, because her dissatisfaction isn't based on a legitimate issue with the contractor's performance.\n\nOn the other hand, if there's something genuinely wrong with the finish, like it's chipping off or not what was agreed upon, then her dissatisfaction would be justified.\n\nIn this scenario, it says the homeowner \"truthfully\" said she didn't like the finish. So, it seems like she's being honest about her feelings, but those feelings might not be based on an objective defect in the work.\n\nPerhaps the contractor can argue that the finish meets industry standards or was agreed upon beforehand, and that the homeowner's dislike is subjective and not a valid reason to withhold payment.\n\nAnother angle: maybe there's a clause in the contract that specifies what \"complete personal satisfaction\" means or how disputes over satisfaction are to be resolved. For example, maybe there's a mediation process or a mechanism for an independent inspector to evaluate the work.\n\nIf such clauses don't exist, the contractor might have to prove that the work was done to the standards agreed upon and that the homeowner's dissatisfaction is not reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, the homeowner might have to show that the work was substandard or didn't meet the contract specifications.\n\nGiven that, I'm leaning towards option C: yes, because the homeowner breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by rejecting the cabinets without justification. If the finish is acceptable and meets the contract terms, then her withholding of payment based on personal taste could be seen as acting in bad faith.\n\nOption A might be too simplistic because it assumes that the homeowner's satisfaction is absolute and cannot be challenged. In reality, courts often look at whether the satisfaction is being applied reasonably.\n\nOption B seems off because the contractor isn't the one supplying unsatisfactory materials; it's the homeowner who is dissatisfied with the materials provided.\n\nOption D suggests that the homeowner was the first to breach the contract by not paying the full amount. But is that necessarily a breach if she has a legitimate reason to withhold payment based on her dissatisfaction?\n\nI think the answer is C. The contractor is likely to prevail because the homeowner's rejection of the cabinets without a justified reason breaches the covenant of good faith and fair dealing inherent in the contract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
