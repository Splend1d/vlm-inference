                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a police search and consent given by a wife while her husband is out of town. The police are investigating the husband for drug trafficking and found evidence in their mutual bedroom. Now, the husband wants to suppress all that evidence, but the wife consented to the search. I need to figure out if the court will likely deny his motion because of that consent.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the concept of consent searches in criminal law. Generally, if someone has authority over a place or property, they can consent to a search of that place. But in this case, it's a shared space\u2014their mutual bedroom. So, both the husband and wife have some level of authority over it, right?\n\nLet me think about the legal principles involved. There's a idea called \"joint authority\" or \"common authority\" where if two people share control over a space, either one can consent to a search of that space, even if the other person isn't present or doesn't agree.\n\nWait, but I think there are limits to that. For example, if one person has exclusive control over certain areas within a shared space, maybe the other person can't consent to those areas. But in this case, it's a mutual bedroom, so presumably both have access to all parts of it.\n\nLet me consider a specific case that might be relevant. I recall a case called United States v. Matlock, where the Supreme Court held that one co-occupant can consent to a search of a shared space without the other co-occupant's consent, as long as the consenting person has common authority over the premises.\n\nSo, applying that to this scenario, the wife has common authority over the bedroom, and she gave consent to search it. Therefore, the search was valid, and the evidence should not be suppressed.\n\nBut let's think deeper. What if the husband had something in the bedroom that was solely his and not accessible to the wife? For example, if he had a locked drawer or a safe that only he could open, would the wife's consent extend to those areas?\n\nI think not. In such cases, the wife's consent wouldn't allow the police to access those private areas because she doesn't have authority over them. But in this scenario, the evidence was found in a dresser drawer that was presumably accessible to both of them since it's a mutual bedroom.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether the husband had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the bedroom even when he was out of town. Since it's a shared space, and the wife is living there, does his absence affect her ability to consent?\n\nI think the key here is that both have equal rights and authority over the space. So, even if the husband is out of town, the wife can still consent to a search of their mutual bedroom.\n\nLet me also consider the notes that were found\u2014names and phone numbers of co-conspirators. These might be written documents or electronic data. Does the consent to search the physical space also encompass the contents of documents found within?\n\nI believe so, because consent to search a particular area generally includes the items found within that area. So, if the police have consent to search the bedroom, they can look through papers and other items in that space.\n\nNow, about the kilo of cocaine found in the dresser drawer. Assuming that the dresser is a shared piece of furniture, both have access to its drawers, so the wife's consent should cover that.\n\nWait, but what if the husband had told the wife not to go into certain drawers or had some understanding that those drawers were private to him? Could that affect the scope of the wife's consent?\n\nPossibly. If there was an understanding between them that certain drawers were off-limits to each other, then the wife's consent might not extend to those specific areas. However, without evidence of such an agreement, it's probably assumed that both have access to all drawers in their mutual bedroom.\n\nIn practice, courts look at whether the consenting person had the practical ability to authorize the search. Since the wife had access to the bedroom and presumably to the dresser drawers, her consent should be valid.\n\nLet me also consider the timing. The husband is out of town, so he's not there to object to the search. Does that make a difference?\n\nIn Matlock, the Supreme Court said that one co-occupant can consent even if the other is absent. So, the fact that the husband is out of town shouldn't affect the validity of the wife's consent.\n\nWhat if the police knew that the husband was out of town and specifically chose to come when he wasn't home? Does that matter?\n\nWell, if the police intentionally waited for the husband to be absent to avoid his potential objection, that might be relevant. But as long as the wife had the authority to consent, her consent stands.\n\nUnless there's some overreaching or coercion by the police, which isn't mentioned here, the consent seems voluntary.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, it seems that the court would likely deny the motion to suppress the evidence because the wife's consent was valid.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. No, the search was unconstitutional because a wife cannot give consent for her husband.\n\nThis seems incorrect based on Matlock. Wives can consent if they have common authority over the space.\n\nB. No, the search was unconstitutional because the items were under the husband's control and the wife therefore had no authority to give consent.\n\nBut in this case, the bedroom is mutual, and the dresser drawers are presumably accessible to both. So, she does have authority to consent to their search.\n\nC. Yes, the search was proper because one who possesses joint authority over property can validly consent on behalf of the absent occupant.\n\nThis aligns with Matlock and seems correct.\n\nD. The search was unconstitutional because the police did not have a search warrant.\n\nActually, in this scenario, the police didn't need a warrant because they had voluntary consent from someone with authority over the space.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. Yes, the search was proper because one who possesses joint authority over property can validly consent on behalf of the absent occupant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
