                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Congress, and I need to figure out which one of these statements isn't true. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, option A says that only Congress can pass laws. Hmm, I thought that Congress makes the laws, but doesn't the President have to sign them? Wait, but even if the President vetoes a bill, Congress can override the veto with a two-thirds majority, right? So, in that case, they can still make it into a law without the President's final signature. So, maybe A is true because ultimately, it's Congress that passes the laws, even if the President tries to stop them.\n\nNext, option B says that a proposed amendment must be approved by two-thirds of the delegates in both houses of Congress. I remember that amending the Constitution is a pretty strict process. Yeah, I think it does require a two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate to propose an amendment. Then it has to be ratified by the states, but this part is about Congress. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption C says that Congress can override a presidential veto if two-thirds of the House and Senate agree to do so. I think that's right. It's called a veto override, and it does take a two-thirds majority in both chambers to override the President's veto. So, this should be true as well.\n\nNow, option D says that congressional power over the bureaucracy is less than that of the president. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about this one. The bureaucracy is part of the executive branch, which is headed by the President. So, the President has direct authority over the bureaucracy. But Congress does have oversight powers; they can investigate executive actions and pass laws that guide the bureaucracy. However, in terms of day-to-day management, that's more the President's role. But does Congress have less power overall over the bureaucracy? Maybe not, because they can influence it through legislation and funding. Wait, but the President can veto laws, so even if Congress wants to pass something to control the bureaucracy, the President can stop it. But Congress can also cut funding, which affects the bureaucracy. This is getting a bit confusing.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider that while the President manages the bureaucracy, Congress has the power of the purse strings\u2014they control spending through appropriations bills. Without funding, the bureaucracy can't operate. Also, Congress can pass laws that regulate how the bureaucracy operates. So, in that sense, Congress has significant power over the bureaucracy.\n\nOn the other hand, the President appoints many top officials in the bureaucracy, subject to Senate confirmation, and can issue executive orders that guide administrative actions. So, there's a balance of power here.\n\nBut the statement says that congressional power over the bureaucracy is less than that of the president. Is that necessarily true? Maybe it depends on the specific context or the particular Congress and President in office at the time.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option D isn't always true. Maybe in some cases, Congress has more power over the bureaucracy, especially through its legislative and funding abilities.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the statement that's not true. So, if D is sometimes false, then it's the correct answer.\n\nLet me double-check. A, B, and C seem to be accurate based on what I know about Congress's powers and the amendment process. So, D might be the exception here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all of these are true, and I'm missing something. But that seems unlikely.\n\nNo, I think D is the one that isn't always true. Congressional power over the bureaucracy isn't necessarily less than that of the president, depending on the situation.\n\nSo, my answer would be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
