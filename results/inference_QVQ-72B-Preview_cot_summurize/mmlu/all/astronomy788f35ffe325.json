                    "text": "So I've got this question about the solar nebula and its ingredients. It's asking me to list the components from the highest to the lowest percentage of mass in the nebula. The options are:\n\nA. hydrogen compounds (H2O, CH4, NH3), light gases (H, He), metals, rocks\n\nB. hydrogen compounds (H2O, CH4, NH3), light gases (H, He), rocks, metals\n\nC. light gases (H, He), hydrogen compounds (H2O, CH4, NH3), metals, rocks\n\nD. light gases (H, He), hydrogen compounds (H2O, CH4, NH3), rocks, metals\n\nI need to figure out which one is correct. Let me start by understanding what the solar nebula is. From what I remember, the solar nebula was a disk of gas and dust that surrounded the young Sun. This nebula eventually formed the planets and other celestial bodies in our solar system.\n\nNow, I need to think about the composition of this nebula. I know that the universe is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, especially in the early stages after the Big Bang. So, it makes sense that the solar nebula would be rich in these elements.\n\nLooking at the options, both C and D list light gases (H, He) first, followed by hydrogen compounds, and then either metals and rocks or rocks and metals. Options A and B start with hydrogen compounds, which seems less likely because hydrogen compounds like H2O, CH4, and NH3 are more complex and probably less abundant than the basic hydrogen and helium gases.\n\nSo, between C and D, one of them is likely correct. Now, I need to decide the order between metals and rocks. I need to understand what is considered a metal and what is considered a rock in this context.\n\nIn astronomy, \"metals\" typically refer to elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, which can include a wide range of elements like carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, and so on. \"Rocks\" would probably refer to silicate materials, which are common in terrestrial planets.\n\nGiven that, metals would include a broader range of elements, some of which are more abundant than others. Rocks, specifically silicates, are also common, but in terms of mass percentage, I need to recall the abundances.\n\nLet me try to recall the relative abundances of elements in the solar nebula. Hydrogen is by far the most abundant element, followed by helium. Then come elements like oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and so on, which are considered metals in astronomical terms.\n\nHydrogen compounds like H2O, CH4, and NH3 would be next in abundance, but still less than the pure hydrogen and helium gases.\n\nAs for rocks, which are primarily silicate materials, they are composed of elements like oxygen, silicon, magnesium, iron, etc. These elements are also considered metals in astronomical terminology.\n\nGiven that, I think the order should be:\n\n1. Light gases (H, He)\n\n2. Hydrogen compounds (H2O, CH4, NH3)\n\n3. Metals (heavier elements)\n\n4. Rocks (silicates)\n\nSo, option C seems correct: light gases (H, He), hydrogen compounds (H2O, CH4, NH3), metals, rocks.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure about the classification of rocks within metals. In astronomy, metals include all elements heavier than helium, which would include both rocky materials and metals in the common sense.\n\nHowever, in planetary science, rocks are specifically referred to as silicate-rich materials, while metals can refer to elements like iron and nickel.\n\nGiven that, perhaps rocks are a subset of metals, but I'm a bit confused now. Maybe I need to look at it differently.\n\nLet me consider the mass fractions of these components in the solar nebula.\n\nI know that hydrogen makes up about 70-75% of the mass of the Sun, and helium about 25-27%. The remaining 1-2% is all the other elements combined, which are considered metals in astronomy.\n\nBut in the solar nebula, there was a higher proportion of heavier elements compared to the Sun because of the incorporation of interstellar dust.\n\nStill, hydrogen and helium should dominate the nebula's mass.\n\nNow, hydrogen compounds like water (H2O), methane (CH4), and ammonia (NH3) would be present in the nebula, but their abundances are much lower than those of hydrogen and helium.\n\nSimilarly, metals and rocks would be even less abundant.\n\nWait a minute, but rocks are primarily made up of oxygen, silicon, magnesium, iron, etc., which are all metals in astronomical terms.\n\nSo, perhaps the order is light gases, hydrogen compounds, and then metals, with rocks being a subset of metals.\n\nBut that doesn't match any of the options directly.\n\nMaybe I need to think in terms of condensation temperatures.\n\nIn the solar nebula, different materials condensed at different distances from the Sun based on temperature.\n\nClose to the Sun, only materials with high condensation temperatures could form solids, like metals and silicates, which became the terrestrial planets.\n\nFarther out, where it was colder, volatile compounds like water, methane, and ammonia could condense, forming the icy giants.\n\nEven farther out, where it was even colder, hydrogen and helium could condense, forming the gas giants.\n\nBut in terms of mass percentage, I think hydrogen and helium were still the dominant components even in the outer regions.\n\nSo, perhaps the question is trying to list the ingredients based on their mass fractions, not on their condensation sequences.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's considering the composition of the nebula as a whole, including both the gaseous and solid components.\n\nI need to recall some specific numbers to make a better judgment.\n\nI know that in the present-day solar system, the Sun is composed of about 73% hydrogen and 25% helium by mass, with the remaining 2% being heavier elements.\n\nThe protosun and the solar nebula likely had similar compositions, although there might have been some fractionation during the formation process.\n\nNow, in the solar nebula, the heavier elements were present as both gases and solids.\n\nThe solids included dust particles composed primarily of silicates and metals, while the gases included not only hydrogen and helium but also other volatile compounds.\n\nSo, perhaps the light gases (H, He) made up the majority, followed by hydrogen compounds, and then the metals and rocks.\n\nBut I'm still unsure about the order between metals and rocks.\n\nMaybe I should look at the bulk composition of the solar system.\n\nConsidering that the terrestrial planets are primarily rocky with some metallic cores, and the gas giants have more hydrogen and helium with some ices and rocks, but still, hydrogen and helium dominate.\n\nPerhaps the best estimate is that light gases (H, He) are the most abundant, followed by hydrogen compounds, then metals, and finally rocks.\n\nThat would correspond to option C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe rocks are included under metals, making option C still valid.\n\nWait, but option D lists rocks before metals, which might also be possible if rocks are primarily silicates, which are considered metals in astronomical terms.\n\nBut I think in astronomical terminology, metals include all elements heavier than helium, which would encompass both metals in the common sense and rocks (silicates).\n\nTherefore, option C seems more accurate because rocks are a subset of metals.\n\nSo, the correct order should be light gases (H, He), hydrogen compounds (H2O, CH4, NH3), metals, rocks.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
