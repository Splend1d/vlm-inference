                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this equation to solve: -6x = -36. I need to find the value of x, and then check my answer to make sure it's correct. Okay, let's start by looking at the options provided:\n\nA. 1 over 6\n\nB. 6\n\nC. 1 over 216\n\nD. 216\n\nHmm, these seem pretty different, so I should carefully solve the equation to avoid any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the equation is -6x = -36. I need to solve for x. To do that, I should isolate x by dividing both sides of the equation by -6. Let's do that step by step.\n\nSo, starting with:\n\n-6x = -36\n\nI'll divide both sides by -6:\n\nx = -36 / -6\n\nNow, dividing -36 by -6. I remember that dividing two negative numbers gives a positive result because the negatives cancel each other out.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n-36 \u00f7 -6 = 6\n\nSo, x = 6\n\nAlright, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nIs there another way to approach this equation? Maybe I can try to check my answer by plugging it back into the original equation.\n\nSo, if x = 6, then:\n\n-6*(6) = -36\n\n-36 = -36\n\nYes, that checks out. It seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there are any other steps or if I'm missing something. The equation looks simple, and the operation seems clear. But just to be thorough, I'll consider if there are any fractions or more complex operations involved, but in this case, it's a straightforward algebraic equation.\n\nLet me also consider if the options might be trying to trick me in some way. For example, option A is 1 over 6, which is 1/6. That might be the result if I misdivide or something, but I don't think so. Option C is 1 over 216, which seems unrelated to the equation, and option D is 216, which is just the right-hand side without division.\n\nSo, based on my calculations and the check, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. 6.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's go through the steps again:\n\n1. Start with the equation: -6x = -36\n\n2. Divide both sides by -6: x = -36 / -6\n\n3. Calculate: -36 \u00f7 -6 = 6\n\n4. Verify by plugging back in: -6*6 = -36\n\nYes, everything matches up.\n\nI don't think there's anything else I need to consider here. It's a simple equation to solve for x, and the answer is indeed 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
