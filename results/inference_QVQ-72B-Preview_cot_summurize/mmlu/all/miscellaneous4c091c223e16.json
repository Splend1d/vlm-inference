Hmm, I need to pick the correct answer from these choices.\n\nFirst off, I know that New Zealand is a country, and it's somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. I think it's made up of two main islands, the North Island and the South Island. But where is the capital located?\n\nLet me think about this. I remember that Auckland is a big city in New Zealand, famous for its harbor and bridges. It's on the North Island, I believe. But is it the capital? I think it's more of a commercial center, but I'm not sure if it's the actual capital.\n\nThen there's Wellington. I've heard of Wellington too; it's also on the North Island, isn't it? I think it's smaller than Auckland, but maybe it's the capital. Wait, I have a vague memory of learning that Wellington is indeed the capital of New Zealand.\n\nSydney and Melbourne are both in Australia, not New Zealand. Sydney is the capital of New South Wales and a major city, but it's definitely in Australia. Similarly, Melbourne is the capital of Victoria, also in Australia. So, those seem like distractors here.\n\nSo, between Auckland and Wellington, Wellington seems more likely to be the capital. Let me try to confirm this. I recall that many capitals are centrally located or have historical significance. Wellington is located at the southern tip of the North Island, and it's known for its parliament buildings and being the seat of government.\n\nAuckland, while larger and more well-known perhaps, is more of a financial and cultural hub. So, that suggests that Wellington is the actual capital.\n\nAlternatively, maybe New Zealand has multiple capitals for different functions, but I don't think that's the case. I think Wellington is the main capital.\n\nJust to make sure, I can think about the flag of New Zealand. It has stars and a union jack, similar to Australia's flag, but that doesn't help me here.\n\nMaybe I should consider the time zone. New Zealand is further east than Australia, so it would be ahead in time, but again, that doesn't directly answer the question.\n\nAnother thought: the Maori culture is prominent in New Zealand, and perhaps the capital has significance in Maori history or governance, but I don't know enough about that to make a connection here.\n\nI think I've narrowed it down pretty well. The options are Sydney, Wellington, Auckland, and Melbourne. Sydney and Melbourne are definitely in Australia, so they can be eliminated. Between Auckland and Wellington, Wellington is the capital.\n\nTo wrap it up, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. Wellington.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. Wellington}} \\]"
