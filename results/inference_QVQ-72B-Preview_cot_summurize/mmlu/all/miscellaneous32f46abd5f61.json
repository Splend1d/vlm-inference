Ms. Espinosa is writing a thank-you letter with her students, and she's focusing on some early literacy skills while doing so. The question is asking which of the given options is the most appropriate focus for 3-year-old students. The options are:\n\nA. Paraphrasing ideas\n\nB. Spelling words correctly\n\nC. Expressing speech in print\n\nD. Capitalizing proper nouns\n\nAlright, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the typical developmental stage of 3-year-olds. At this age, children are just beginning to explore language and literacy. They're learning how to communicate effectively, and their understanding of written language is still developing.\n\nLet me recall what I know about early literacy milestones for 3-year-olds:\n\n- They are starting to recognize that print carries meaning.\n\n- They may be able to write a few letters, often their own name.\n\n- They enjoy listening to stories and can retell simple stories in their own words.\n\n- They are learning to distinguish between letters and words.\n\n- They are beginning to understand that words are made up of sounds.\n\nGiven this background, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A: Paraphrasing ideas**\n\nParaphrasing involves restating someone else's ideas in your own words. For 3-year-olds, who are still developing their language skills, paraphrasing might be challenging. They are still learning the structure of language and may not have the verbal agility to rephrase complex ideas accurately. While they might be able to retell a simple story in their own words, paraphrasing in a more academic sense is probably beyond their current capabilities.\n\n**Option B: Spelling words correctly**\n\nAt 3 years old, children are just beginning to experiment with writing. Their spelling is often phonetic, meaning they write words based on how they sound. For example, they might write \"lov\" for \"love\" or \"hous\" for \"house.\" While it's important for them to explore writing and understand that letters represent sounds, expecting them to spell words correctly at this stage is not realistic. Emphasizing correct spelling at this young age might actually discourage them from writing due to fear of making mistakes.\n\n**Option C: Expressing speech in print**\n\nThis seems like a very broad category. It essentially means turning spoken words into written ones. For 3-year-olds, this could involve dictating what they want to say and having an adult write it down for them, or attempting to write simple words themselves using their emerging writing skills. This aligns well with the activity described in the scenario, where Ms. Espinosa is recording the students' responses on chart paper.\n\n**Option D: Capitalizing proper nouns**\n\nProper nouns are specific names of people, places, or things, and they require capitalization in written English. For example, \"Ms. Espinosa,\" \"rescue squad,\" or \"thank-you letter\" would require capital letters in standard written English. However, 3-year-olds are still learning the basics of language and writing. They might not yet understand the concept of nouns, let alone proper nouns. Expecting them to capitalize these correctly would be premature at this age.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that **Option C: Expressing speech in print** is the most appropriate focus for 3-year-old students in this context. This is because it aligns with their current developmental stage and literacy skills. By focusing on expressing speech in print, Ms. Espinosa is supporting their emerging understanding of how spoken language translates into written form, which is a fundamental aspect of early literacy development.\n\nMoreover, this approach encourages children to see themselves as writers and communicators, even at a young age. It validates their ideas and helps build their confidence in using language, both spoken and written.\n\nIn summary, for 3-year-old students, the most appropriate focus in this scenario is expressing speech in print, as it supports their current literacy development and fosters a positive attitude towards writing and communication.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
