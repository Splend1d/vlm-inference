                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out these two statements about group homomorphisms. The first one says that a homomorphism may have an empty kernel, and the second one says that it's not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group. I need to determine whether each statement is true or false.\n\nLet me start with the first statement. I know that a homomorphism between two groups is a function that preserves the group operation. The kernel of a homomorphism is the set of elements in the domain that map to the identity element in the codomain. So, for a homomorphism \u03c6: G \u2192 H, the kernel is {g \u2208 G | \u03c6(g) = e_H}, where e_H is the identity element in H.\n\nNow, is it possible for this kernel to be empty? Well, I recall that the kernel of any homomorphism always contains at least the identity element of the domain group G, because \u03c6(e_G) = e_H by definition. So, the kernel can never be empty; it always has at least one element. Therefore, statement 1 is false.\n\nMoving on to statement 2: it claims that it's not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group. A nontrivial homomorphism means a homomorphism that is not the trivial homomorphism, which is the one that maps every element of G to the identity of H.\n\nSo, the question is whether there always exists a homomorphism from a finite group G to an infinite group H that is not just the trivial homomorphism. I need to see if this is necessarily true or if there are cases where it's possible.\n\nFirst, let's consider what a homomorphism does. It maps elements of G to elements of H in a way that preserves the group operation. The image of G under \u03c6, which is \u03c6(G), is a subgroup of H. So, \u03c6(G) is a subgroup of H that is isomorphic to G if \u03c6 is injective.\n\nNow, since G is finite and H is infinite, \u03c6(G) must be finite because it's isomorphic to a finite group. But H is infinite, so \u03c6(G) is a finite subgroup of an infinite group.\n\nIs there anything that prevents such a homomorphism from existing? Not really. For example, consider the finite group Z_2 (integers modulo 2 under addition) and the infinite group Z (integers under addition). We can define a homomorphism \u03c6: Z_2 \u2192 Z by \u03c6(0) = 0 and \u03c6(1) = 1. This is a nontrivial homomorphism because it maps elements non-trivially.\n\nWait, but Z is infinite, and Z_2 is finite, and this homomorphism is well-defined and nontrivial. So, in this case, statement 2 is false because such a homomorphism does exist.\n\nBut let's think deeper. Is there any general reason why such a homomorphism couldn't exist for any finite group G and any infinite group H? I don't think so. As long as H has at least as many elements as G, which it does since it's infinite, there should be a way to embed G into H or at least map G into H non-trivially.\n\nMoreover, for any group G, including finite ones, and any infinite group H, we can always find a nontrivial homomorphism. For instance, if H contains a subgroup that is isomorphic to G, then we can embed G into H via that subgroup. Even if H doesn't contain such a subgroup, we can still map G to a finite quotient of H, or find some other mapping that isn't trivial.\n\nTherefore, statement 2 is false because it is possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism from a finite group to an infinite group.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Statement 1: False, because the kernel of a homomorphism cannot be empty; it always contains at least the identity element of the domain group.\n\n- Statement 2: False, because it is possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism from a finite group to an infinite group.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct answer should be B. False, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
