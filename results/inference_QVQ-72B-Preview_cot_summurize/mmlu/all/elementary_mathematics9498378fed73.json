Okay, mental math means I should try to figure this out in my head without writing anything down or using a calculator.\n\nSo, I need to find a number that, when multiplied by 8, gives me 56. Let me think about that. I know that 8 times 7 is 56. Yeah, that's right because 7 times 8 is 56.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe there's another way to think about it. Maybe I can divide 56 by 8 to find y. Yeah, that makes sense too. 56 divided by 8 is 7.\n\nHmm, another way\u2014maybe using addition. Like, if 8 times something is 56, and I know that 8 times 7 is 56, then y must be 7. Or, I could think in terms of doubles. Like, 8 times 4 is 32, and 8 times 3 is 24, so 8 times 7 is 56.\n\nAlso, I could use the fact that 56 divided by 8 is the same as 56 \u00f7 8, which is 7. So, that confirms it.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Is there a possibility of negative numbers here? Well, since the question is about solving 8y = 56, and y is likely a positive integer, I think y = 7 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check if y = 7 satisfies the equation:\n\n8 * 7 = 56\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. 6\n\nB. 7\n\nC. 8\n\nD. 9\n\nSo, among these, option B is 7, which is the correct answer.\n\nI should also consider if there's any trick here. Is there a chance that y could be something else? For example, maybe the equation is not straightforward, but I think it's pretty clear: 8 times y equals 56, so y must be 7.\n\nAlright, I feel confident about this. The answer is B. 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 7} \\]"
