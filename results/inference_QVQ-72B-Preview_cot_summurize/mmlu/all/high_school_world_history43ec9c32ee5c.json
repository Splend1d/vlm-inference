Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potos\u00ed have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potos\u00ed, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.\nHeinrich von F\u00fcch, \"On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,\" 1744\nAccording to the second passage, which of the following contributed most to the burden faced by native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question. It seems like we've got two historical passages here, one about mining in South America in the 17th century and another about the treatment of natives in Siberia in the 18th century. The question is focusing on the second passage and asking what contributed most to the burden faced by native Siberians in fulfilling their tribute obligations.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being said in the second passage. It's from Heinrich von F\u00fcch in 1744, talking about the Yakut and Tungus natives in Northeast Siberia. These natives were under Russian control and were required to pay a tribute called yasak, which could be in the form of furs or cash.\n\nThe passage says that initially, there were plenty of furbearing animals like sables and foxes, but by the time of the report, there weren't many left. It also mentions that many natives couldn't hunt because they no longer had horses, which had been pawned to the yasak collectors.\n\nSo, the natives were supposed to pay their tribute in furs, but the furs were depleted, and without horses, they couldn't hunt effectively anyway. That must have put them in a tough spot.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Interference by Russian Orthodox missionaries\n\nB. Native inexperience in hunting deep into the subarctic tundra\n\nC. Competition from Russian hunters and trappers\n\nD. Overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals\n\nI need to determine which of these was the primary contributor to the natives' burden in fulfilling their tribute obligations.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Interference by Russian Orthodox missionaries.\n\nThe passage doesn't mention anything about missionaries or religious interference affecting the natives' ability to pay their tribute. It focuses on the yasak system and the depletion of fur resources. So, this seems unlikely to be the main contributor based on the information provided.\n\nOption B: Native inexperience in hunting deep into the subarctic tundra.\n\nThe passage suggests that the natives were hunters; they just couldn't hunt effectively anymore because of the depletion of furbearing animals and the loss of their horses. It doesn't mention any inexperience in hunting in the subarctic tundra. In fact, since they were required to pay tribute in furs, it implies that they had some level of experience in hunting for furs. So, this option doesn't seem to align with the information given.\n\nOption C: Competition from Russian hunters and trappers.\n\nThis is a possible factor. If Russian hunters and trappers were also hunting in the same areas, they could be depleting the fur resources faster, making it harder for the natives to find enough furs to pay their tribute. However, the passage doesn't explicitly mention competition from Russian hunters. It does say that furbearing animals are depleted, but it doesn't specify the reason for depletion.\n\nOption D: Overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals.\n\nThis seems directly relevant. The passage clearly states that there are no longer many furbearing animals in the region. This suggests that overhunting has led to a significant reduction in the animal populations, making it difficult for the natives to collect enough furs to pay their tribute.\n\nNow, between options C and D, which one is more directly supported by the passage?\n\nOption C suggests competition from Russian hunters, but the passage doesn't mention Russian hunters being present in the area. It talks about the natives being required to pay tribute and the depletion of fur resources, but doesn't specify who caused the depletion.\n\nOption D, on the other hand, directly states that furbearing animals are depleted, which directly impacts the natives' ability to pay their tribute.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the passage, option D seems to be the most accurate answer.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nThe passage says that initially, there were plenty of furbearing animals, but by the time of the report, they were depleted. It also mentions that many natives couldn't hunt because they no longer had horses, which had been pawned to the yasak collectors.\n\nSo, the natives were caught in a cycle where they had to pay tribute in furs, but the furs were being overhunted, leading to depletion, and without horses, they couldn't hunt effectively to find the remaining animals.\n\nThis seems to point towards overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals as the main contributor to their burden.\n\nPerhaps there's a broader context here. If the furbearing animals were being overhunted, it could be due to increased demand for furs, possibly driven by European markets, leading to intensified hunting by both natives and Russians.\n\nHowever, again, the passage doesn't specify the involvement of Russian hunters; it only mentions the natives being required to pay tribute in furs and the depletion of those resources.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the passage, the most straightforward answer is that overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals contributed most to the burden faced by native Siberians in fulfilling their tribute obligations.\n\nI think the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
