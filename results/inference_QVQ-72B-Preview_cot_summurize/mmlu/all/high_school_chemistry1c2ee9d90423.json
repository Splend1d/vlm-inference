                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about writing a net ionic equation for the reaction between NH4Br and AgNO3 in solution. I need to figure out what happens when these two solutions mix. Let's start by understanding what these compounds are and how they behave in solution.\n\nFirst, NH4Br is ammonium bromide. Ammonium is NH4+, and bromide is Br-. So in solution, NH4Br dissociates into NH4+ and Br- ions.\n\nNext, AgNO3 is silver nitrate, which dissociates into Ag+ and NO3- ions in solution.\n\nNow, when I mix these two solutions, I have NH4+, Br-, Ag+, and NO3- present. The problem is asking for the net ionic equation, which means I need to find out which ions react with each other to form a precipitate or undergo some kind of chemical change.\n\nI should recall that some ionic compounds are insoluble in water and can precipitate out of solution. According to solubility rules, silver bromide (AgBr) is insoluble in water, while ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) is soluble.\n\nSo, if Ag+ and Br- ions combine, they could form AgBr(s), which is a solid precipitate. On the other hand, NH4+ and NO3- are both soluble, so they would remain in solution.\n\nTherefore, the net ionic equation should show the formation of AgBr precipitate from Ag+ and Br- ions.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Ag+(aq) + Br-(aq) \u2192 AgBr(s)\n\nThis seems to match what I just thought. Ag+ and Br- combine to form AgBr(s), which is the precipitate.\n\nB. NH4+(aq) + Ag+(aq) \u2192 Ag(NH4)3+2(aq)\n\nHmm, this suggests that NH4+ and Ag+ react to form some complex ion. But based on my knowledge, NH4+ and Ag+ don't typically react in this way under these conditions. Maybe this is not the main reaction happening here.\n\nC. Br-(aq) + NO3-(aq) \u2192 NO3Br(aq)\n\nWait, NO3Br isn't something I'm familiar with. I think bromine and nitrogen oxides can form compounds, but in this context, it's unlikely. Br- and NO3- don't usually react to form a covalent compound directly.\n\nD. NH4Br(aq) + NO3-(aq) \u2192 NH4NO3(aq) + Br-(aq)\n\nThis seems like a molecular equation rather than a net ionic equation. In a net ionic equation, only the ions that are directly involved in the reaction are shown. Here, it's showing the reaction between NH4Br and NO3-, but based on my earlier reasoning, NH4+ and NO3- are both soluble and remain in solution, so this doesn't seem right.\n\nTherefore, option A seems to be the correct net ionic equation for this reaction.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider the complete ionic equation first and then derive the net ionic equation.\n\nThe complete ionic equation would be:\n\nNH4+(aq) + Br-(aq) + Ag+(aq) + NO3-(aq) \u2192 NH4+(aq) + NO3-(aq) + AgBr(s)\n\nSimplifying this by removing the spectator ions, which are NH4+ and NO3-, we get:\n\nAg+(aq) + Br-(aq) \u2192 AgBr(s)\n\nYes, that matches option A.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. Ag+(aq) + Br-(aq) \u2192 AgBr(s)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
