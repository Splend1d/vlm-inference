Month; The Bureau of Economic Analysis\n\nC. Month; The Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nD. Quarter; The Bureau of Economic Analysis\n\nFirst, I need to remember what CPI stands for. I think it's the Consumer Price Index, which measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. So, it's an important economic indicator to understand inflation.\n\nNow, I need to recall how frequently the CPI is released. I think it's usually reported on a monthly basis. Let me confirm that. Yes, I believe the CPI is typically calculated and released each month, providing data on price changes from the previous month and over the year.\n\nNext, I need to know which agency calculates the CPI. Is it the Bureau of Economic Analysis or the Bureau of Labor Statistics? Hmm, I think the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is responsible for collecting and analyzing data on employment, unemployment, and prices. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), on the other hand, focuses more on national economic accounts, like GDP.\n\nSo, given that, it seems logical that the Bureau of Labor Statistics would be the one calculating the Consumer Price Index, since it's related to prices paid by consumers.\n\nLet me double-check that. I recall that the BLS is part of the U.S. Department of Labor, and one of its main functions is to measure price changes through the CPI and the Producer Price Index (PPI). The BEA, part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, is more involved with measuring the overall economic performance of the country, like GDP and personal income.\n\nTherefore, the CPI is calculated monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Week; The Bureau of Economic Analysis\n\nB. Month; The Bureau of Economic Analysis\n\nC. Month; The Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nD. Quarter; The Bureau of Economic Analysis\n\nThe correct choice is C. Month; The Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nI should make sure there isn't any confusion with other economic indicators. For example, the BEA does release quarterly economic data like GDP, but CPI is indeed a monthly release by the BLS.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can think about the recent CPI reports I've heard about. They are usually released early in the month, providing data from the previous month. For example, the January CPI report comes out in February, and so on.\n\nAlso, I know that the CPI is used to adjust many economic series for inflation, and having it on a monthly basis helps economists and policymakers monitor price trends closely.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the CPI is calculated monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
