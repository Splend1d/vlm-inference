                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem about walking the dog. In the morning, I walked the dog 7/9 miles, and in the afternoon, I walked 5/12 miles. I need to find out how much farther I walked in the morning than in the afternoon. So, basically, I need to subtract the afternoon distance from the morning distance. That would be 7/9 minus 5/12.\n\nOkay, first things first, when I subtract fractions, they need to have the same denominator. So, I need to find a common denominator for 9 and 12. Let me think about the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12.\n\nThe factors of 9 are 3 and 3, and the factors of 12 are 2, 2, and 3. So, the LCM would be the highest power of each prime number: 2^2 times 3^2, which is 4 times 9, equal to 36. So, the common denominator is 36.\n\nNow, I need to convert both fractions to have the denominator of 36.\n\nFor 7/9, to get the denominator to 36, I need to multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 4 because 9 times 4 is 36. So, 7 times 4 is 28. So, 7/9 is equal to 28/36.\n\nFor 5/12, to get the denominator to 36, I need to multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 3 because 12 times 3 is 36. So, 5 times 3 is 15. So, 5/12 is equal to 15/36.\n\nNow, I can subtract the two fractions: 28/36 minus 15/36 is equal to 13/36.\n\nSo, I walked 13/36 miles farther in the morning than in the afternoon.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 13 over 36\n\nB. 12 over 21\n\nC. 2 over 3\n\nD. 35 over 108\n\nSo, option A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I found the common denominator correctly by finding the LCM of 9 and 12, which is 36.\n\nThen, I converted 7/9 to 28/36 by multiplying numerator and denominator by 4.\n\nNext, I converted 5/12 to 15/36 by multiplying by 3.\n\nSubtracting 15/36 from 28/36 gives 13/36, which seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if 13/36 is simplified properly. Let's see, 13 is a prime number, so it can't be reduced further with 36. So, 13/36 is the simplest form.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also check the other options to see if they could possibly be the answer.\n\nOption B is 12 over 21. Well, 12 divided by 21 is 4/7, which doesn't match our answer of 13/36.\n\nOption C is 2 over 3. That's 2 divided by 3, which is approximately 0.666, and 13/36 is approximately 0.3611, so that doesn't match.\n\nOption D is 35 over 108. Let's see, 35 divided by 108 is approximately 0.324, which is different from our 13/36 of about 0.3611.\n\nTherefore, the only correct option is A. 13 over 36.\n\nI think that's it. I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 13 \\text{ over } 36} \\]"
