                    "text": "Let's tackle this logic problem. So, the statement is \"Some animals are neglected by cruel people.\" And we have these predicates:\n\n- Ax: x is an animal\n\n- Cx: x is cruel\n\n- Px: x is a person\n\n- Nxy: x neglects y\n\nFirst, I need to translate this English sentence into predicate logic. The key here is to capture that there are some animals that are being neglected by people who are cruel.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- \"Some animals\" means there exists at least one animal (x), so that's (\u2203x).\n\n- That animal is neglected by a cruel person. So, there exists a person (y) who is cruel and neglects that animal, which is (\u2203y)(Py \u2022 Cx \u2022 Nxy).\n\nWait, no. Actually, the way I wrote it, I have Cx, but Cx is \"x is cruel,\" but in this case, it's the person y who should be cruel, not the animal x. So, I need to be careful with the variables.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nThe statement is \"some animals are neglected by cruel people.\" So, there exists an animal x, and there exists a person y who is cruel, and y neglects x.\n\nSo, in logic terms, that would be:\n\n(\u2203x)(Ax \u2022 (\u2203y)(Py \u2022 Cy \u2022 Nxy))\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them exactly match this. Maybe I need to rearrange it to match the format of the given options.\n\nLet's look at option B: (\u2203x)[(Cx \u2022 Px) \u2022 (\u2203y)(Ay \u2022 Nxy)]\n\nWait, that says there exists an x that is cruel and a person, and there exists a y that is an animal and x neglects y. That seems different from what I have.\n\nOption A: (\u2203x)[(Ax \u2022 Cx) \u2022 (\u2203y)(Py \u2022 Nyx)]\n\nThat says there exists an x that is an animal and cruel, and there exists a y that is a person and neglects x. Hmm, but the original statement is about animals being neglected by cruel people, not cruel animals being neglected by people.\n\nOption C: (\u2203x)[(Ax \u2022 Px) \u2022 (\u2203y)(Cy \u2022 Nxy)]\n\nThat says there exists an x that is an animal and a person, and there exists a y that is cruel and x neglects y. That seems mixed up too.\n\nOption D: (\u2203x)(\u2203y){[(Ax \u2022 Cy) \u2022 Py] \u2022 Nxy)]}\n\nWait, this one has (\u2203x)(\u2203y), but the grouping is tricky. It seems like it's saying there exists an x and a y such that x is an animal and y is cruel and y is a person, and x is neglected by y. So, x is the animal being neglected by y, who is a cruel person.\n\nWait, but in D, it's [(Ax \u2022 Cy) \u2022 Py] \u2022 Nxy. So, x is an animal, y is cruel, y is a person, and x is neglected by y. So, yes, that seems to capture \"some animals are neglected by cruel people.\"\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOriginal statement: some animals are neglected by cruel people.\n\nIn logic: there exists an x, x is an animal, and there exists a y, y is a cruel person, and y neglects x.\n\nSo, in symbols: (\u2203x)(Ax \u2022 (\u2203y)(Py \u2022 Cy \u2022 Nxy))\n\nOption D: (\u2203x)(\u2203y){[(Ax \u2022 Cy) \u2022 Py] \u2022 Nxy)}\n\nWait, in option D, it's written as (\u2203x)(\u2203y){[(Ax \u2022 Cy) \u2022 Py] \u2022 Nxy)}\n\nBut actually, the standard way to write this would be (\u2203x)(\u2203y)(Ax \u2022 Cy \u2022 Py \u2022 Nxy)\n\nBecause all conditions apply to the same x and y.\n\nBut in option D, it's grouped as [(Ax \u2022 Cy) \u2022 Py] \u2022 Nxy, which is logically equivalent to Ax \u2022 Cy \u2022 Py \u2022 Nxy, because conjunction is associative.\n\nSo, option D seems correct.\n\nBut let's check the other options again to make sure.\n\nOption A: (\u2203x)[(Ax \u2022 Cx) \u2022 (\u2203y)(Py \u2022 Nyx)]\n\nThis says there exists an x that is an animal and cruel, and there exists a y that is a person and neglects x. So, this is about cruel animals being neglected by people, which is not what the original statement says. The original statement is about animals being neglected by cruel people.\n\nOption B: (\u2203x)[(Cx \u2022 Px) \u2022 (\u2203y)(Ay \u2022 Nxy)]\n\nThis says there exists an x that is cruel and a person, and there exists a y that is an animal and x neglects y. So, cruel people neglect animals. That's similar to the original, but not exactly the same. The original says \"some animals are neglected by cruel people,\" which implies that there are animals that are being neglected by people who are cruel. This option seems close but not quite.\n\nOption C: (\u2203x)[(Ax \u2022 Px) \u2022 (\u2203y)(Cy \u2022 Nxy)]\n\nThis says there exists an x that is an animal and a person, and there exists a y that is cruel and x neglects y. This is confusing because an entity can't be both an animal and a person unless specified otherwise. So, this seems invalid.\n\nOption D: (\u2203x)(\u2203y){[(Ax \u2022 Cy) \u2022 Py] \u2022 Nxy)}\n\nThis seems to correctly capture the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the best translation is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
