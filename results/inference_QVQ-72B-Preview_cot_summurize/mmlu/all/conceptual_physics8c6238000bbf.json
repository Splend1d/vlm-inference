                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a string that's been plucked and it's producing four loops, which are called antinodes. The total length of the string is 12.00 meters, and I need to find the wavelength of the wave. The options are A. 48.0 m, B. 24.0 m, C. 6.00 m, and D. 3.00 m.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. When you pluck a string, it vibrates and produces standing waves. These standing waves have points that don't move, called nodes, and points that move a lot, called antinodes or loops. The distance between two adjacent nodes or two adjacent antinodes is half of the wavelength.\n\nSo, if there are four loops (antinodes), I can visualize the string having four places where it's moving a lot, separated by nodes in between.\n\nLet me sketch this out mentally:\n\n- Node, Antinode, Node, Antinode, Node, Antinode, Node, Antinode, Node.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let's think again.\n\nIn a standing wave on a string fixed at both ends, the pattern starts and ends with a node, and the antinodes are in between.\n\nFor four loops (antinodes), the pattern would be:\n\n- Node, Antinode, Node, Antinode, Node, Antinode, Node, Antinode, Node.\n\nSo, that's nine segments in total, with four antinodes.\n\nNow, the distance between two adjacent nodes is one wavelength because that's the basic pattern of a standing wave.\n\nBut here, with four antinodes, it's a bit more complex.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the number of half-wavelengths in the string.\n\nEach loop (antinode) corresponds to a half-wavelength.\n\nSo, four loops would mean four half-wavelengths.\n\nTherefore, the total length of the string is four times the half-wavelength.\n\nSo, L = 4 * (\u03bb/2)\n\nGiven that L is 12.00 m, then:\n\n12.00 m = 4 * (\u03bb/2)\n\nSimplify that:\n\n12.00 m = 2\u03bb\n\nTherefore, \u03bb = 6.00 m\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 6.00 m seems to be the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that in a standing wave on a string fixed at both ends, the relationship between the wavelength and the length of the string for the fundamental frequency (n=1) is \u03bb = 2L.\n\nBut in this case, we have four loops, which might correspond to a higher harmonic.\n\nFor the nth harmonic, the wavelength is \u03bb_n = 2L/n.\n\nHere, n is the number of antinodes, which is 4.\n\nSo, \u03bb_4 = 2L/4 = L/2 = 12.00 m / 2 = 6.00 m.\n\nAgain, this points to option C. 6.00 m.\n\nWait a minute, but is this correct?\n\nI recall that in a standing wave on a string fixed at both ends, the fundamental frequency has one antinode, and each successive harmonic adds another antinode.\n\nSo, for n=1: one antinode (loop)\n\nn=2: two antinodes\n\nn=3: three antinodes\n\n...\n\nn=4: four antinodes\n\nSo, if n=4, then \u03bb_4 = 2L/4 = L/2 = 6.00 m.\n\nBut actually, for the nth harmonic, the wavelength is \u03bb_n = 2L/n.\n\nSo, \u03bb_4 = 2*12.00 m / 4 = 6.00 m / 2 = 3.00 m.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Which method is correct?\n\nLet me check again.\n\nIn the first approach, I considered that four loops correspond to four half-wavelengths, so total length L = 2\u03bb.\n\nThus, \u03bb = L/2 = 6.00 m.\n\nIn the second approach, using the formula for the nth harmonic, \u03bb_n = 2L/n, where n is the number of antinodes.\n\nFor n=4, \u03bb_4 = 2*12.00 m / 4 = 6.00 m / 2 = 3.00 m.\n\nThis is giving me two different answers: 6.00 m and 3.00 m.\n\nI need to resolve this discrepancy.\n\nLet me look up the formula for the wavelength in the nth harmonic of a standing wave on a string fixed at both ends.\n\nI recall that for a string fixed at both ends, the wavelengths for the harmonics are given by:\n\n\u03bb_n = 2L/n, where n is the harmonic number (1,2,3,...)\n\nBut in this context, n also corresponds to the number of antinodes.\n\nSo, for n=1: \u03bb_1 = 2L/1 = 2L\n\nn=2: \u03bb_2 = 2L/2 = L\n\nn=3: \u03bb_3 = 2L/3\n\nn=4: \u03bb_4 = 2L/4 = L/2\n\nSo, for n=4, \u03bb = L/2 = 6.00 m.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that each loop corresponds to a half-wavelength, so four loops would be four half-wavelengths, totaling two wavelengths, meaning L = 2\u03bb, so \u03bb = L/2 = 6.00 m.\n\nBut according to the formula \u03bb_n = 2L/n, for n=4, \u03bb = 2L/4 = L/2 = 6.00 m.\n\nWait, both methods now agree on \u03bb = 6.00 m.\n\nEarlier, I must have made a mistake in applying the formula.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\nFor n=4, \u03bb_4 = 2L/4 = L/2 = 6.00 m.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 6.00 m.\n\nI think I was confused earlier by misapplying the formula.\n\nSo, the wavelength is indeed 6.00 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
