Undocumented residents. Hmm, I need to think about this carefully.\n\nFirst off, I know that Medicaid is a jointly funded federal and state program that provides health coverage for low-income individuals, people with disabilities, and other vulnerable populations. It's been around since the 1960s and has evolved over the years with various expansions and changes.\n\nNow, considering who primarily benefits from Medicaid, I should look at the demographics that are most commonly eligible for the program. I recall that Medicaid covers a significant portion of pregnant women and children in the United States. In fact, a large majority of Medicaid recipients are women and children.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Single men. While single men can certainly qualify for Medicaid if they meet the income requirements, I don't think they make up the largest group of beneficiaries. There might be specific circumstances, like being disabled or elderly, that could increase their eligibility, but generally, I don't see them as the primary beneficiary group.\n\nOption B: The elderly. Medicaid does provide coverage for elderly individuals, especially those who are low-income or have high healthcare needs. However, I think that the elderly might not be the largest group benefiting from Medicaid, especially when compared to women and children.\n\nOption C: Women and children. This seems like a likely answer. I remember reading statistics that a significant majority of Medicaid recipients are mothers and their children. Medicaid covers a large portion of births in the United States and provides ongoing health coverage for families. Plus, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which is often linked with Medicaid, specifically targets low-income children.\n\nOption D: Undocumented residents. This is a tricky one. While some states may provide Medicaid coverage to undocumented residents under certain circumstances, like for pregnant women or children, generally, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid or CHIP unless they qualify under limited circumstances, such as emergency medical care. So, I don't think undocumented residents are the major beneficiary group.\n\nConsidering all this, I'm leaning towards C. Women and children. It just makes sense given the structure of Medicaid and the populations it's designed to serve. Plus, the numbers support this: according to data, a majority of Medicaid recipients are indeed women and children.\n\nJust to double-check, let's think about some key points:\n\n1. Medicaid is a safety net for low-income individuals and families.\n\n2. It provides coverage for pregnant women, which is a significant group.\n\n3. It covers a large portion of childbirths in the U.S.\n\n4. Children from low-income families are major beneficiaries due to CHIP and other Medicaid expansions.\n\n5. While the elderly and disabled are covered, their numbers might not be as high as women and children.\n\n6. Undocumented residents generally do not qualify for full Medicaid benefits.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. Women and children.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
