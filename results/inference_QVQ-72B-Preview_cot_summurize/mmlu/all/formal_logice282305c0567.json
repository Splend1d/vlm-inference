The symbols are:\n\n- j: Jos\u00e9\n\n- k: Kevin\n\n- w: Wilma\n\n- Ixyz: x introduces y to z\n\nSo, the predicate Ixyz means that x is the one doing the introducing, y is being introduced to z.\n\nFirst, I need to identify who is introducing whom. The statement says that Kevin is introduced to Jos\u00e9 by Wilma.\n\nSo, Wilma is the one doing the introducing. Therefore, x should be Wilma.\n\nThen, Kevin is the one being introduced, so y should be Kevin.\n\nAnd Jos\u00e9 is the one he's being introduced to, so z should be Jos\u00e9.\n\nWait, but let's double-check that. The way it's phrased is \"Kevin is introduced to Jos\u00e9 by Wilma.\"\n\nSo, in the predicate Ixyz, x is the introducer, y is the one being introduced, and z is the one he's being introduced to.\n\nSo, introducer is Wilma (w), the one being introduced is Kevin (k), and the one he's being introduced to is Jos\u00e9 (j).\n\nSo, it should be Iw j k\n\nWait, but in the options, it's Ixyz, so it's I w j k, which is Iwjk.\n\nBut let's see the options again:\n\nA. Iwjk\n\nB. Ijkw\n\nC. Ikjw\n\nD. Iwkj\n\nOption A is Iwjk, which seems to match what I just thought.\n\nBut let's consider if there could be any confusion.\n\nOption B is Ijkw, which would mean Jos\u00e9 introduces Kevin to Wilma. That's not what the statement says.\n\nOption C is Ikjw, which would mean Kevin introduces Jos\u00e9 to Wilma. Also not matching.\n\nOption D is Iwkj, which would mean Wilma introduces Wilma to Kevin. That doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, clearly, option A, Iwjk, is the correct translation.\n\nI think I've got it right. Just to be sure, maybe I should consider if there's any other way to interpret \"Kevin is introduced to Jos\u00e9 by Wilma.\"\n\nIs there any chance that Wilma is not the introducer? Maybe in some contexts, but based on the straightforward reading, it's Wilma introducing Kevin to Jos\u00e9.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that option A is the correct translation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
