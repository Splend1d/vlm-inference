                    "text": "Let's see. Sanjay watched 3 television shows, and each one was 30 minutes long. So, if I add up the time for those shows, it should be 3 times 30, right? Let me calculate that: 3 multiplied by 30 is 90 minutes.\n\nThen, he also watched 1 movie that was 90 minutes long. So, adding that to the time he spent on the shows would be 90 plus 90. Let me add those together: 90 plus 90 is 180 minutes.\n\nWait a second, the options are from 100 to 180, and 180 seems to be the total. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nHe watched 3 shows, each 30 minutes, and 1 movie of 90 minutes. So, 3 times 30 is indeed 90, and adding 90 from the movie gives 180 minutes in total.\n\nHmm, is there any other way to look at it? Maybe breaking it down differently. For example, considering the shows and the movie separately.\n\nSo, total time for shows: 3 shows \u00d7 30 minutes/show = 90 minutes.\n\nTotal time for the movie: 1 movie \u00d7 90 minutes/movie = 90 minutes.\n\nAdding them up again: 90 + 90 = 180 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the total number of minutes and seeing if there's any overlap or something, but no, the problem seems straightforward.\n\nLet me consider if there's any trick here. Maybe checking if the movie is included in the shows or something like that, but no, it says he watched 3 television shows and 1 movie, so they are separate.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the units. Each show is 30 minutes, and there are 3 of them, so 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 minutes. The movie is 90 minutes, so total time is 90 + 90 = 180 minutes.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nA. 100\n\nB. 120\n\nC. 150\n\nD. 180\n\nGiven that, 180 seems to be the correct total.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the movie might have been longer or shorter, but according to the problem, it's 90 minutes.\n\nAlso, perhaps checking if the shows are all the same length, which they are, so no issue there.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The calculation is straightforward: 3 shows at 30 minutes each plus 1 movie at 90 minutes equals 180 minutes in total.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 180.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation.\n\nCould there be any subtraction involved? For example, if some time was spent changing channels or something, but no, the problem doesn't mention any breaks or interruptions.\n\nIt's simply the sum of the durations of the shows and the movie watched.\n\nTherefore, the total number of minutes Sanjay watched television last weekend is 180 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
