                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about Newton's laws and why the acceleration due to free fall is the same for all masses. I need to pick which of Newton's laws explains this. There are four options: the first law, the second law, the third law, and the law of action-reaction. Hmm, the law of action-reaction is actually Newton's third law, right? So maybe that's just a different way of saying the third law.\n\nFirst, I should recall what each law states. Newton's first law, also known as the law of inertia, says that an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. So, it's about how objects resist changes to their state of motion.\n\nNewton's second law relates force, mass, and acceleration. It says that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. So, F = ma. This law connects the concepts of force and acceleration.\n\nNewton's third law, or the law of action and reaction, states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Meaning, when two objects interact, they apply forces to each other that are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.\n\nNow, the question is about why the acceleration due to free fall is the same for all masses. I know that on Earth, regardless of the mass of an object, if it's in free fall, it will accelerate towards the ground at approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2, assuming no air resistance.\n\nSo, let's think about this. If I have two objects of different masses, say a feather and a bowling ball, and I drop them from the same height in a vacuum, they will hit the ground at the same time. That's because the heavier object has a greater gravitational force acting on it, but it also has more mass, which resists acceleration. According to Newton's second law, F = ma, so if the force is larger for the heavier object, but its mass is also larger, the acceleration ends up being the same.\n\nWait, but that's kind of explaining it with the second law. But is there another way to look at it? Maybe using the third law? Let's see.\n\nNewton's third law talks about action and reaction forces. When an object falls towards the Earth, the Earth is actually being pulled up towards the object as well, but since the Earth is so massive, its acceleration is negligible. But this seems more about the mutual attraction rather than the acceleration of the object towards the Earth.\n\nMaybe I should consider the gravitational force. The gravitational force between two masses is given by F = G*(m1*m2)/r\u00b2, where G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses, and r is the distance between their centers.\n\nIf I consider an object of mass m falling towards the Earth of mass M, the force on the object is F = G*m*M/r\u00b2, and the acceleration of the object is a = F/m = G*M/r\u00b2. So, the acceleration doesn't depend on the mass m of the object, which is why all objects fall at the same rate.\n\nThis seems to be derived from Newton's second law, because I used F = ma to find a = F/m.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of energy, the potential energy lost as the object falls is converted into kinetic energy, and since the acceleration due to gravity is constant near the Earth's surface, the acceleration is the same for all masses.\n\nBut the question is specifically about which law explains this fact. Is it the first law, second law, third law, or the law of action-reaction?\n\nGiven that I used the second law to derive the expression for acceleration, it seems like the second law is directly involved here. The first law talks about inertia, but doesn't directly relate force and acceleration. The third law explains the mutual forces between two masses, but again, doesn't directly explain why acceleration is the same for all masses.\n\nMoreover, the law of action-reaction is just another way of stating the third law, so it's essentially the same concept.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is Newton's second law, because it directly relates force, mass, and acceleration, allowing us to see that a = F/m, and since gravitational force is proportional to mass, the mass cancels out, resulting in the same acceleration for all objects.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. second law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ second law}} \\]"
