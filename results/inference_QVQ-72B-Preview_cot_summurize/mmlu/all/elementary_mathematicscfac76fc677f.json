                    "text": "Let's see here. Maria spends $9 on lunch each day she's at work. So, for a 5-day workweek, she multiplies 5 times 9 to find out how much she spends in total. Okay, I need to calculate 5 multiplied by 9.\n\nHmm, I know that multiplication is just repeated addition. So, if she spends $9 each day, for 5 days, I can add $9 five times. Let me do that: 9 plus 9 is 18, plus 9 is 27, plus 9 is 36, plus 9 is 45. So, that would be $45 in total for the week.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a better way to think about it. I remember learning multiplication tables in school. Let me recall: 5 times 9. Yeah, 5 times 9 is 45. That matches what I got from adding 9 five times.\n\nLet me double-check if there's any other way this could be approached. Maybe using some other method or formula, but no, this seems straightforward. It's a simple multiplication problem without any tricks.\n\nI should look at the options provided to make sure. The options are:\n\nA. $40\n\nB. $45\n\nC. $50\n\nD. $59\n\nSo, according to my calculation, the answer should be B. $45.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any other factor involved. For example, does she spend the same amount every day, or could there be variations? But the problem says she spends $9 each day she's at work, and it's a 5-day workweek. It doesn't mention any changes in spending from day to day.\n\nAlso, I should confirm if there are any costs subtracted or added, like maybe discounts or something, but no, the problem is pretty straightforward.\n\nLet me think about the units. She spends $9 per day, and there are 5 days in the workweek. So, multiplying the daily spending by the number of days should give the total weekly spending on lunch.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to express it in terms of dollars per day times the number of days. That is, $9/day \u00d7 5 days = $45.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. It's a simple multiplication problem, and the answer should indeed be $45.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check the other options. $40 would be 5 times 8, which is less than 5 times 9. $50 would be 5 times 10, which is more than 5 times 9. And $59 doesn't make sense because that would be almost 6 times 10, which is way off.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. $45.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ \\$45} \\]"
