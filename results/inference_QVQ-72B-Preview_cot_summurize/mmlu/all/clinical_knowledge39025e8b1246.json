                    "text": "So I have this question about rheumatoid arthritis, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that rheumatoid factor is present in 25% of rheumatoid cases. Hmm, I thought rheumatoid factor was pretty common in rheumatoid arthritis. Let me recall: Rheumatoid factor (RF) is an antibody that's often detected in people with rheumatoid arthritis. I think the percentage is higher than 25%. I believe it's present in about 80% of people with rheumatoid arthritis, especially those with more advanced disease. So, if that's the case, this option is probably false.\n\nOption B says that rheumatoid arthritis is an example of an oligoarthropathy. Oligoarthropathy refers to arthritis that affects a few joints, typically fewer than five. Rheumatoid arthritis, from what I remember, is usually a polyarticular disease, meaning it affects multiple joints across the body. It's common for it to start in smaller joints like the hands and feet and then spread to other areas. So, it's generally considered a polyarthropathy, not an oligoarthropathy. Therefore, this option is likely false.\n\nOption C states that anaemia is a common finding in rheumatoid arthritis. Anaemia is a reduction in the number of red blood cells or the amount of haemoglobin in the blood. In rheumatoid arthritis, chronic inflammation can lead to anaemia of chronic disease, which is quite common. In fact, it's one of the extrarticular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis. Many patients, especially those with long-standing disease, develop anaemia. So, this seems like a true statement.\n\nOption D mentions that Heberden's nodes are a feature of rheumatoid arthritis. Heberden's nodes are bony enlargements that occur at the distal interphalangeal joints of the fingers. I think these are more commonly associated with osteoarthritis, not rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease, whereas rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory condition. So, Heberden's nodes are typically seen in osteoarthritis, not in rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, this option is probably false.\n\nSo, after reviewing all the options, it seems that Option C, \"Anaemia is a common finding,\" is the correct statement about rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
