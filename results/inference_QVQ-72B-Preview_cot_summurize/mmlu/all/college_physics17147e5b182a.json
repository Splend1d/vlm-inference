                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a collision between two particles. One particle has a mass of 2m and it's colliding with another particle that has a mass of m, and this one is at rest. After the collision, they stick together, which sounds like a completely inelastic collision. I need to find out what fraction of the initial kinetic energy is lost in this collision.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall the formulas for kinetic energy and momentum, since collisions involve both of these concepts. Kinetic energy is given by (1/2)mv\u00b2, and momentum is mv. In a collision, momentum is conserved, meaning the total momentum before the collision equals the total momentum after the collision.\n\nSo, let's define the initial and final states.\n\nInitial state:\n- Particle 1: mass 2m, moving with some velocity v_i.\n- Particle 2: mass m, at rest, so its velocity is 0.\n\nFinal state:\n- After collision, the two particles stick together, forming a single object with mass (2m + m) = 3m, moving with some velocity v_f.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the initial kinetic energy (KE_i) and the final kinetic energy (KE_f), and then find the difference to see how much is lost.\n\nKE_i = (1/2)(2m)(v_i)^2 + (1/2)(m)(0)^2 = (1/2)(2m)(v_i)^2 = m v_i\u00b2\n\nKE_f = (1/2)(3m)(v_f)^2 = (3/2)m v_f\u00b2\n\nNow, the energy lost is KE_i - KE_f.\n\nBut to find the fraction lost, I need to divide the energy lost by the initial kinetic energy:\n\nFraction lost = (KE_i - KE_f) / KE_i\n\nBefore I plug in the expressions, maybe I can find v_f in terms of v_i using conservation of momentum.\n\nMomentum before collision:\n\nTotal momentum = (2m)(v_i) + (m)(0) = 2m v_i\n\nMomentum after collision:\n\n(3m)(v_f)\n\nSince momentum is conserved:\n\n2m v_i = 3m v_f\n\nI can solve for v_f:\n\nv_f = (2/3) v_i\n\nNow, plug this into KE_f:\n\nKE_f = (3/2) m (v_f)^2 = (3/2) m ( (2/3) v_i )^2 = (3/2) m (4/9) v_i\u00b2 = (6/9) m v_i\u00b2 = (2/3) m v_i\u00b2\n\nNow, KE_i is m v_i\u00b2\n\nSo, fraction lost = (m v_i\u00b2 - (2/3) m v_i\u00b2) / (m v_i\u00b2) = (1 - 2/3) = 1/3\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people get confused with the masses and velocities, so maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nLet me think about the coefficients.\n\nInitial kinetic energy is indeed (1/2)(2m)(v_i)^2 = m v_i\u00b2\n\nFinal kinetic energy is (1/2)(3m)(v_f)^2\n\nFrom momentum conservation:\n\n2m v_i = 3m v_f => v_f = (2/3) v_i\n\nSo, KE_f = (1/2)(3m)((2/3) v_i)^2 = (3/2)m * (4/9) v_i\u00b2 = (12/18)m v_i\u00b2 = (2/3)m v_i\u00b2\n\nTherefore, energy lost is m v_i\u00b2 - (2/3)m v_i\u00b2 = (1/3)m v_i\u00b2\n\nSo, fraction lost is (1/3)m v_i\u00b2 / m v_i\u00b2 = 1/3\n\nHmm, seems consistent.\n\nWait, but the options include 0, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2. So, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the coefficients more carefully.\n\nLet me see if there's another way.\n\nMaybe using the formula for completely inelastic collision.\n\nIn a completely inelastic collision, the maximum possible kinetic energy is lost because the objects stick together.\n\nThere's a formula for the fraction of kinetic energy lost in such a collision.\n\nI think it's (1 / (1 + (m2 / m1)) ), where m1 is the mass of the moving object and m2 is the mass of the stationary object.\n\nWait, in this problem, m1 = 2m and m2 = m.\n\nSo, fraction lost = 1 / (1 + (m / 2m)) = 1 / (1 + 0.5) = 1 / 1.5 = 2/3\n\nWait, that's different from what I got earlier.\n\nHmm, maybe I messed up the formula.\n\nLet me look it up in my notes.\n\nOkay, for a completely inelastic collision, the fraction of kinetic energy lost is given by:\n\nfraction lost = (m2 / (m1 + m2))\n\nIn this case, m1 = 2m, m2 = m.\n\nSo, fraction lost = m / (2m + m) = m / 3m = 1/3\n\nAh, so my initial calculation was correct.\n\nI must have misremembered the formula earlier.\n\nSo, the correct fraction lost is 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 1/3\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the velocities again.\n\nInitial velocity of the system: since it's at rest, total momentum is 2m v_i\n\nAfter collision, combined mass is 3m, moving with v_f = (2/3) v_i\n\nSo, KE_f = (1/2)(3m)(v_f)^2 = (3/2)m (4/9)v_i\u00b2 = (12/18)m v_i\u00b2 = (2/3)m v_i\u00b2\n\nInitial KE = (1/2)(2m)(v_i)^2 = m v_i\u00b2\n\nDifference: m v_i\u00b2 - (2/3)m v_i\u00b2 = (1/3)m v_i\u00b2\n\nFraction lost: (1/3)m v_i\u00b2 / m v_i\u00b2 = 1/3\n\nYes, consistent again.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 1/3\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
