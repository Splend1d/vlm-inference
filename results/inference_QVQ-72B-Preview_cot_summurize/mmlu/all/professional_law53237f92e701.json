The rental agreement provided that the land was to be used as farmland. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the tract of land, he built thereon, at his own expense, a barn made of lumber, which was 15 feet wide, 20 feet long, and set on loose bricks. The barn increased the appraised market value of the tract of land from $250,000 to $275,000. The tenant then began farming operations on the land. Toward the end of the lease period, the owner informed the tenant that he was going to put the tract of land up for sale. The next month, when the lease expired, the parties settled a dispute over the tenant's right, if any, to compensation for the improvements by the following written agreement:\"On the sale of the tract of land, the owner hereby agrees to pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds in excess of $250,000, provided that tenant may remain on the farm for the next year, rent-free, while the owner tries to sell it. After that time, the tenant may remain on the land until closing of the sale, at a monthly rental of $1,000. \"The owner initially set the asking price at $300,000. After receiving scant interest, the owner decided to reduce the price to $260,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the farm to all of the prospective buyers. Finally, 14 months after the agreement between the owner and the tenant was executed, and after rejecting offers for $240,000 and $250,000, the owner sold the tract of land for $256,000 to a buyer who visited the land while the tenant was away on vacation. Thereupon, the tenant, who had failed to pay the last two months rent as per the agreement, moved out. After closing, the owner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds, and the tenant brought suit to recover damages for breach of contract. Which of the following is the owner's most persuasive argument in defense of the tenant's suit?\n\nA. The tenant committed an uncured material breach of an implied promise to cooperate in the owner's efforts to sell the property, or at least not to hinder the proposed sale.\nB. The tenant's negative comments about the farm to prospective buyers amounted to an anticipatory repudiation of the agreement between the owner and the tenant.\nC. The tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract that discharged the owner's remaining duties of performance.\nD. The agreement between the owner and the tenant was voidable because it was a restraint on alienation, since it conditioned a promise to pay for a conveyance of land upon an otherwise invalid leasehold contract.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario to analyze. It's about a land lease and some improvements made by the tenant, followed by a dispute over the sale of the land. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a landowner who leases a large unimproved tract of land to a tenant for five years at $1,500 per month. The lease specifies that the land is to be used as farmland. Shortly after taking possession, the tenant builds a barn at their own expense. This barn increases the land's appraised market value from $250,000 to $275,000. So, the tenant has added value to the property through this improvement.\n\nNear the end of the lease period, the owner decides to sell the land and informs the tenant of this plan. When the lease expires, they settle a dispute over compensation for the improvements with a written agreement. The agreement states that upon sale of the land, the owner will pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds exceeding $250,000. Additionally, the tenant can stay on the farm rent-free for the next year while the owner tries to sell it. After that, the tenant can remain until closing at a monthly rent of $1,000.\n\nThe owner initially lists the land for $300,000 but later drops the price to $260,000 due to lack of interest. This price reduction angers the tenant, who then makes negative comments about the farm to prospective buyers. As a result, the owner receives offers of $240,000 and $250,000 but eventually sells the land for $256,000 to a buyer who saw the land while the tenant was away on vacation.\n\nAfter the sale, the tenant, who hadn't paid rent for the last two months, moves out. The owner refuses to pay the tenant any portion of the sale proceeds and is sued by the tenant for breach of contract.\n\nNow, I need to consider the owner's most persuasive defense against the tenant's lawsuit.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. The tenant committed an uncured material breach of an implied promise to cooperate in the owner's efforts to sell the property, or at least not to hinder the proposed sale.\n\nThis seems plausible. The tenant made negative comments to prospective buyers, which likely hindered the sale process. There might be an implied covenant in the agreement that the tenant won't interfere with the sale. By making negative comments, the tenant may have breached this implied promise.\n\nB. The tenant's negative comments about the farm to prospective buyers amounted to an anticipatory repudiation of the agreement between the owner and the tenant.\n\nAnticipatory repudiation occurs when one party indicates they will not perform their contractual obligations before they are due to perform. In this case, the tenant's negative comments might suggest they intend not to fulfill their part of the agreement, especially if the agreement requires them to cooperate with the sale process.\n\nC. The tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract that discharged the owner's remaining duties of performance.\n\nThis is also a strong point. The tenant agreed to pay $1,000 per month after the initial rent-free year. If they failed to pay rent for the last two months, that could be considered a breach of contract. However, the agreement might specify that the rent payments are separate from the sale proceeds sharing arrangement.\n\nD. The agreement between the owner and the tenant was voidable because it was a restraint on alienation, since it conditioned a promise to pay for a conveyance of land upon an otherwise invalid leasehold contract.\n\nThis seems a bit more complex. A restraint on alienation refers to a restriction on the owner's ability to sell or transfer property. However, in this case, the owner is trying to sell the land, and the agreement with the tenant is about sharing proceeds from the sale. It's not immediately clear if this constitutes an invalid restraint on alienation.\n\nNow, I need to think about which of these defenses is the most persuasive.\n\nOption A suggests that the tenant breached an implied promise not to hinder the sale. While this may be true, it might not directly affect the owner's obligation to share the sale proceeds, unless the agreement specifies that cooperation is a condition precedent to the tenant's right to a share of the proceeds.\n\nOption B proposes that the tenant's actions amount to anticipatory repudiation. If proven, this could relieve the owner of their obligations under the agreement. However, it's not entirely clear if the tenant's negative comments rise to the level of repudiation of the entire agreement.\n\nOption C points out that the tenant failed to pay rent for two months, which is a breach of the agreement. If this breach is material, it could discharge the owner's duties under the agreement. The question is whether this breach is material enough to justify the owner's refusal to pay the tenant any portion of the sale proceeds.\n\nOption D argues that the agreement is voidable due to being a restraint on alienation. This seems less likely, as the agreement doesn't prevent the owner from selling the land; it just conditions the sharing of proceeds based on the sale price.\n\nConsidering all this, I think Option C is the most persuasive defense. The tenant's failure to pay rent for two months is a clear breach of the agreement. Depending on the terms of the agreement, this breach could excuse the owner from paying the tenant any portion of the sale proceeds. In contract law, if one party breaches a contract, the other party may be relieved of their obligations.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether the agreement specifies that the rent payments and the sale proceeds sharing are independent obligations. If they are separate and do not depend on each other, then the tenant's failure to pay rent might not affect the owner's obligation to share the sale proceeds.\n\nBut, in many contracts, rent payments and other obligations are interconnected, and a breach in one area can affect the entire agreement.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the agreement includes any provisions for offsets or set-offs, allowing the owner to deduct the unpaid rent from the amount owed to the tenant.\n\nBut since the question is about the owner's most persuasive argument in defense of the tenant's suit, and assuming that the agreement doesn't separate the rent obligations from the sale proceeds sharing, the tenant's breach by not paying rent could be a strong defense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the owner could argue that the tenant's negative comments to prospective buyers caused a decrease in the sale price, thereby reducing the amount over $250,000, which would affect the tenant's share.\n\nBut again, that might be more of a counterclaim for damages rather than a defense against the tenant's claim for the agreed-upon share of the sale proceeds.\n\nOverall, I think the owner's best defense is that the tenant breached the agreement by failing to pay rent, thereby excusing the owner from performing their part of the agreement.\n\nSo, my answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
