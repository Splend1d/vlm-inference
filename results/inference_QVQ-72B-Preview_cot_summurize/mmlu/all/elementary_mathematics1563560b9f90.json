                    "text": "So I need to figure out how many packages of balloons I should buy. Each package contains 8 balloons, and I need a total of 42 balloons. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I should probably divide the total number of balloons I need by the number of balloons in each package. So, 42 divided by 8. Let me do that calculation.\n\n42 \u00f7 8 = 5.25.\n\nOkay, so that means I need 5.25 packages. But I can't buy a fraction of a package, right? I have to buy whole packages. So, should I round up or round down?\n\nIf I round down to 5 packages, let's see how many balloons that would give me. 5 packages times 8 balloons each is 40 balloons. But I need 42 balloons, so that's 2 balloons short. That's not enough.\n\nIf I round up to 6 packages, that would be 6 times 8, which is 48 balloons. That's more than I need, but at least I have all 42 balloons covered.\n\nWait a minute, there's an option for 8 packages. That would be 8 times 8, which is 64 balloons. That's a lot more than I need, and I don't think that's necessary.\n\nThere's also an option for 42 packages. Well, that seems excessive because 42 packages would give me 42 times 8, which is 336 balloons, and I only need 42. That doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, between 5 and 6 packages, 5 gives me 40 balloons, which is not enough, and 6 gives me 48, which is more than enough. But I need at least 42.\n\nWait, maybe there's another way to look at it. Maybe I can buy 5 packages and get 40 balloons, and then find some other way to get the remaining 2 balloons. But the question is asking how many packages to buy to have 42 balloons. So, probably, I need to buy enough packages to cover the total needed.\n\nIn that case, I need to make sure I have at least 42 balloons. Since 5 packages give me 40, which is less than 42, I need to buy 6 packages to have 48 balloons, which is more than enough.\n\nBut, is there a better way? Maybe I can buy 5 packages and see if there's a way to get the remaining 2 balloons from somewhere else, but the question seems to suggest that I'm only considering buying full packages.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to buy partial packages, but the problem says packages of 8, so I think I have to buy whole packages.\n\nSo, based on that, I need to buy 6 packages to have at least 42 balloons.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. If I buy 6 packages, 6 times 8 is 48, which is more than 42. That covers it.\n\nIf I buy 5 packages, 5 times 8 is 40, which is less than 42, so I don't have enough balloons.\n\nTherefore, I need to buy 6 packages.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 5\n\nB. 6\n\nC. 8\n\nD. 42\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. 6.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe there's something I'm missing. Is there any possibility of buying balloons individually or something? No, the problem specifies that balloons come in packages of 8, so I have to buy whole packages.\n\nAlright, I think I'm confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
