                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one of each. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst scenario: I saw my brother's empty Coca Cola bottle, which is made of plastic, and I recycled it without being asked. So, someone else's bottle, but I recycled it. Recycling is generally a good thing, right? It helps the environment by reusing materials instead of sending them to landfills. So, in that sense, recycling is positive.\n\nBut, it was my brother's bottle, and I did it without asking. Maybe he wanted to keep it for some reason? Like, perhaps he collects bottles or something. But, unless he had a specific reason to keep it, recycling seems like a responsible action.\n\nWait, but the question says \"my brother's empty Coca Cola bottle.\" It's empty, so he's already consumed it. Maybe he just hasn't gotten around to recycling it yet. Or maybe he planned to recycle it himself. If that's the case, then perhaps I was being helpful by taking care of it.\n\nOn the other hand, if he wanted to keep it for some reason, like for a school project or something, then recycling it without asking might be intrusive or disrespectful. But, unless I know his intentions, it's hard to say.\n\nLet me think about this differently. In general, recycling is encouraged. It's a proactive step towards environmental conservation. So, if I recycle something that's just sitting around, especially if it's empty and presumably waste, it seems like a good deed.\n\nMoreover, family members often help each other out with small tasks like recycling without necessarily asking first. It's part of living together or being close. Unless there's a specific reason not to, I think recycling the bottle is morally acceptable.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: My husband can't wait to watch the mystery movie with the twist ending tonight, and I tell him the twist. So, here, my husband is excited about watching a mystery movie, presumably because he doesn't know the twist, and I spoil it for him by telling him what the twist is.\n\nFirst off, spoilers are generally considered bad manners, especially when it comes to movies, books, or TV shows that rely on surprises for their impact. Telling someone the ending or a major plot point can ruin their enjoyment of the story.\n\nIn this case, it's my husband, and he's clearly looking forward to the movie. By telling him the twist, I'm taking away the element of surprise and potentially diminishing his experience. That seems inconsiderate.\n\nEven if I think the twist isn't that great or if I'm just excited to share the news, it's not fair to spoil it for him without his consent. He has the right to experience the movie as intended, with all the surprises intact.\n\nMoreover, respect for someone else's experience is an important aspect of relationships. By spoiling the movie, I'm showing a lack of consideration for his feelings and desires.\n\nSo, in this scenario, it seems pretty clear that telling him the twist is morally wrong, at least from the perspective of respecting his wishes and not spoiling his enjoyment.\n\nNow, comparing the two scenarios:\n\nIn scenario 1, recycling my brother's empty Coca Cola bottle without asking seems morally acceptable, as it's a positive environmental action and unless there's a specific reason not to, it's a helpful gesture.\n\nIn scenario 2, telling my husband the twist to a movie he's looking forward to watching is morally wrong because it disrespects his desire to experience the movie without knowing the ending.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at this.\n\nPerhaps in scenario 1, if my brother specifically said he wanted to keep all his own bottles for some reason, and I recycled it anyway, that would be wrong. But the scenario doesn't specify that. It just says it was his bottle and it was empty. So, without that context, I think recycling is fine.\n\nIn scenario 2, unless my husband had said it's okay to discuss the movie's plot with him, telling him the twist seems clearly wrong.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
