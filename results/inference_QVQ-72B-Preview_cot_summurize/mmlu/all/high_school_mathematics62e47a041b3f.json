                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a person who went on a walk in different directions. Let me see if I can figure out how far they are from where they started.\n\nFirst, they walked 3 miles to the east. So, that means they moved horizontally to the right on a map, right? Then they turned north and walked 10 miles, which would be upwards on the map. After that, they turned west and walked 6 miles, so that's to the left, and finally, they turned south and walked 16 miles, which is downwards.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to visualize it or maybe draw a diagram. Let me try that.\n\nStarting point: let's call that (0,0).\n\nFirst walk: 3 miles east \u2192 (3,0)\n\nThen 10 miles north \u2191 \u2192 (3,10)\n\nThen 6 miles west \u2190 \u2192 (3-6,10) = (-3,10)\n\nFinally, 16 miles south \u2193 \u2192 (-3,10-16) = (-3,-6)\n\nSo, their final position is at (-3, -6).\n\nNow, to find the distance from the starting point (0,0) to (-3,-6), I can use the distance formula.\n\nDistance = \u221a[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]\n\nPlugging in the coordinates:\n\n\u221a[(-3 - 0)^2 + (-6 - 0)^2] = \u221a[(-3)^2 + (-6)^2] = \u221a[9 + 36] = \u221a45\n\nNow, \u221a45 isn't a whole number. Let me see, \u221a36 is 6, \u221a49 is 7, so \u221a45 is between 6 and 7.\n\nBut the options are in decimal form, so maybe I should convert \u221a45 to decimal.\n\nI know that \u221a45 is the same as \u221a(9*5) = 3\u221a5.\n\nBut that doesn't help much. Maybe I can approximate \u221a5.\n\nI recall that \u221a5 is approximately 2.236.\n\nSo, 3 times 2.236 is about 6.708.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 3.4\n\nB. 6.7\n\nC. 9.2\n\nD. 12.8\n\n6.7 matches option B.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting point: (0,0)\n\nAfter 3 miles east: (3,0)\n\n10 miles north: (3,10)\n\n6 miles west: (3-6,10) = (-3,10)\n\n16 miles south: (-3,10-16) = (-3,-6)\n\nDistance from (0,0) to (-3,-6):\n\n\u221a[(-3-0)^2 + (-6-0)^2] = \u221a[9 + 36] = \u221a45\n\n\u221a45 = \u221a(9*5) = 3\u221a5\n\n\u221a5 \u2248 2.236\n\n3 * 2.236 = 6.708\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the net displacement in east-west and north-south directions.\n\nEast-west: they walked 3 miles east and then 6 miles west.\n\nNet east-west displacement: 3 - 6 = -3 miles (west)\n\nNorth-south: 10 miles north and then 16 miles south.\n\nNet north-south displacement: 10 - 16 = -6 miles (south)\n\nSo, again, final position is (-3, -6)\n\nDistance from starting point: \u221a[(-3)^2 + (-6)^2] = \u221a(9 + 36) = \u221a45 \u2248 6.708 miles\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 6.7 miles.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 3.4\n\nB. 6.7\n\nC. 9.2\n\nD. 12.8\n\nSo, the correct choice is B. 6.7 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6.7} \\]"
