                    "text": "So I have this question about Mayan city-states, and I need to figure out which statement is NOT true about them. The options are:\n\nA. Ruled by autonomous dynasties.\n\nB. Similar in their political organization to Egyptian communities.\n\nC. Supported by large agricultural hinterlands.\n\nD. Much smaller in population than Mohenjo-daro.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what I know about Mayan city-states. The Maya were an ancient civilization known for their advanced cities in Mesoamerica, especially from about 2000 BC to AD 1500. They had a complex social structure and were famous for their architecture, like pyramids and temples.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Ruled by autonomous dynasties.\n\nI remember that Mayan city-states were each governed by their own royal families or dynasties. These dynasties had a lot of power and were somewhat independent, but there might have been alliances or conflicts between different city-states. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption B: Similar in their political organization to Egyptian communities.\n\nEgyptian communities were centralized around pharaohs, with a highly organized bureaucracy and a complex system of gods and religion influencing politics. Mayan city-states also had a theocratic element, with rulers often seen as divine or semi-divine. However, the Mayan political structure was more decentralized compared to the Egyptian empire, which was highly centralized under the pharaoh. So, while there might be some similarities, they weren't entirely similar in political organization.\n\nOption C: Supported by large agricultural hinterlands.\n\nThe Maya relied heavily on agriculture, particularly maize (corn), beans, and squash. Their cities were supported by extensive agricultural systems, including irrigated farming and terrace agriculture in some areas. So, yes, they had large agricultural bases to support their populations.\n\nOption D: Much smaller in population than Mohenjo-daro.\n\nMohenjo-daro was an ancient city in the Indus Valley Civilization, which flourished around 2600-1900 BC. It was a large urban center with advanced planning and infrastructure. Estimates suggest its population was around 40,000 to 60,000 people.\n\nFor Mayan city-states, the sizes varied. Some major centers like Tikal and Calakmul had populations in the tens of thousands during their peaks. But were they smaller than Mohenjo-daro? Well, estimates for Tikal suggest a peak population of around 90,000, which might be larger than Mohenjo-daro. Other Mayan cities might have been smaller, but certainly, some were comparable or even larger.\n\nWait, but the statement says \"much smaller in population than Mohenjo-daro.\" If some Mayan cities had larger populations, then this statement would be incorrect.\n\nSo, based on this, option D seems to be the one that's not true, because some Mayan city-states were comparable or even larger in population than Mohenjo-daro.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe not all Mayan cities were as big as Tikal. For example, smaller Mayan cities might have had populations in the thousands. But the question is about Mayan city-states in general, not just specific cities. City-states imply a broader political entity that includes the city and its surrounding areas.\n\nMoreover, the Indus Valley Civilization had larger populations in total, but individual cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa were among the largest of their time. However, Mayan civilization had multiple large cities that could rival Mohenjo-daro in size.\n\nTherefore, it's not accurate to say that all Mayan city-states were smaller than Mohenjo-daro in population. At least some were comparable or larger.\n\nSo, my final answer is D. Much smaller in population than Mohenjo-daro.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
