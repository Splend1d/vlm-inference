                    "text": "So I have this question here that's asking me to identify a characteristic that distinguishes angiosperms from gymnosperms. The options are perennial growth, true roots, apical growth, and seeds enclosed in ovaries. Hmm, I need to recall what angiosperms and gymnosperms are, and how they differ.\n\nFirst off, I know that angiosperms and gymnosperms are both types of seed plants, but they have some key differences. Angiosperms are flowering plants, and gymnosperms are non-flowering plants that produce seeds in cones or similar structures.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one to see which one is the best answer.\n\nOption A: Perennial growth. Perennial means that the plant lives for more than two years. While some angiosperms are perennial, like trees and shrubs, many are annuals, like most vegetables and flowers, which complete their life cycle in one year. Gymnosperms, on the other hand, are mostly perennial, including evergreen trees like pines and firs. So, perennial growth isn't unique to angiosperms or gymnosperms; both have perennial representatives. Maybe this isn't the best choice.\n\nOption B: True roots. Both angiosperms and gymnosperms have true roots. In fact, true roots are a characteristic of vascular plants, which include both groups. So, having true roots doesn't distinguish angiosperms from gymnosperms. Maybe I should look for something else.\n\nOption C: Apical growth. Apical growth refers to the growth at the tips of stems and roots, which is a feature of vascular plants. Again, both angiosperms and gymnosperms exhibit apical growth. This seems to be a shared characteristic rather than a distinguishing feature. Perhaps I need to consider another option.\n\nOption D: Seeds enclosed in ovaries. This sounds promising. I remember that angiosperms are known for having their seeds enclosed within ovaries, which eventually become fruits. In contrast, gymnosperms have their seeds exposed on the scales of cones or similar structures. So, this seems like a key difference between the two groups.\n\nLet me double-check. Angiosperms produce flowers, and within those flowers, ovaries contain the ovules that develop into seeds after fertilization. The ovary then develops into a fruit, protecting the seeds inside. Gymnosperms, like conifers, have naked seeds that are not enclosed in any protective structure like an ovary or fruit.\n\nSo, based on this, seeds enclosed in ovaries is indeed a characteristic that distinguishes angiosperms from gymnosperms.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that some gymnosperms might have seeds that are partially enclosed or something like that? I think not; gymnosperms are defined by having naked seeds. The name itself comes from Greek words meaning \"naked\" and \"seed.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D: seeds enclosed in ovaries.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other option that could possibly be correct. Perennial growth isn't exclusive to either group, as there are annual angiosperms and perennial gymnosperms. True roots are present in both, and apical growth is a general feature of vascular plants.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that option D is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
