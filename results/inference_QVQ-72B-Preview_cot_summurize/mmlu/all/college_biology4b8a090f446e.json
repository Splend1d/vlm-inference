Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says it's a DNA sequence that can move from one site in the genome to another without replicating. Hmm, that sounds a bit like a transposon, but I remember that transposons do move around the genome, but they can also replicate sometimes. Wait, no, actually, transposons typically move by cutting and pasting themselves to new locations, which might involve replication, but retrotransposons are different because they use an RNA intermediate. So, this option doesn't mention replication via an RNA intermediate, so maybe it's not the best choice.\n\nOption B says it's a DNA sequence that can be deleted from the genome without consequence. Well, that seems too simplistic and not directly related to the nature of retrotransposons. Retrotransposons are known for their ability to move and replicate, not for being deleted without consequence. Plus, being able to delete without consequence doesn't really capture what retrotransposons do, so I think this is incorrect.\n\nOption C says it's a DNA sequence that replicates via an RNA intermediate. This sounds familiar. I think retrotransposons replicate by first being transcribed into RNA, and then that RNA is reverse-transcribed back into DNA, which can then be inserted into the genome at a new location. So, yes, that fits the description of replicating via an RNA intermediate. This seems like a good candidate.\n\nOption D says it's a DNA sequence that replicates via a protein intermediate. Hmm, I'm not sure about this one. I don't recall any process where DNA replicates through a protein intermediate. Proteins are involved in replication, but they're not intermediates in the sense that the genetic material passes through a protein form. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nLet me double-check my understanding. Retrotransposons are elements in the genome that can move to new positions and replicate using an RNA intermediate. This process is similar to what happens in retroviruses, where RNA is reverse-transcribed into DNA and then integrated into the host genome. So, option C seems to align perfectly with this description.\n\nOption A is close but doesn't capture the essence of the replication mechanism involving an RNA intermediate. Option B is not related to the concept of retrotransposition, and option D is misleading because replication via a protein intermediate isn't a known biological process for DNA sequences.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of a retrotransposon is option C: a DNA sequence that replicates via an RNA intermediate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
