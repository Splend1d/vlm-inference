                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about an ideal gas going through an isothermal expansion. It says that the gas does 150 joules of work against its surroundings, and I need to figure out what happens to the heat transfer during this process. The options are:\n\nA. 150 J of heat was added to the gas.\n\nB. 150 J of heat was removed from the gas.\n\nC. 300 J of heat was added to the gas.\n\nD. 300 J of heat was removed from the gas.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall some basic thermodynamics principles. Isothermal means constant temperature, right? So, for an ideal gas, if the temperature remains constant, its internal energy should also remain constant because internal energy depends only on temperature for ideal gases.\n\nSo, \u0394U = 0 for an isothermal process in an ideal gas.\n\nNow, I remember the first law of thermodynamics, which states that:\n\n\u0394U = Q + W\n\nWhere \u0394U is the change in internal energy, Q is the heat transferred to the system, and W is the work done by the system.\n\nGiven that \u0394U = 0, this equation simplifies to:\n\n0 = Q + W\n\nWhich means that Q = -W.\n\nThis implies that the heat transfer is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the work done.\n\nIn this problem, the gas does 150 J of work against the surroundings. So, W = 150 J.\n\nTherefore, Q = -150 J.\n\nThis negative sign indicates that heat is being removed from the gas.\n\nWait a minute, but looking at the options, option B says 150 J of heat was removed from the gas, and option A says 150 J of heat was added to the gas.\n\nAccording to this calculation, Q = -150 J, which means heat is removed from the gas.\n\nSo, option B seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIs there any other factor that could affect the internal energy in this scenario?\n\nWell, for an ideal gas at constant temperature, as I said, \u0394U should be zero. So, Q should indeed be equal to -W.\n\nBut maybe I should consider the type of process or any other properties.\n\nLet me think about the work done. It's given that the gas does 150 J of work against its surroundings. That means the gas is expanding and pushing against the external pressure, doing mechanical work.\n\nIn thermodynamics, work done by the system is considered positive, and work done on the system is negative.\n\nSo, W > 0 indicates work done by the gas.\n\nCorrespondingly, to keep the temperature constant while the gas expands, heat must be removed from the gas to prevent its internal energy from increasing.\n\nBecause if heat were added to the gas while it's expanding, its temperature would tend to increase, which is not the case here.\n\nWait, no. Actually, if heat were added to the gas while it's doing work, that could potentially keep the internal energy constant, but let's think carefully.\n\nLet me recall the first law again: \u0394U = Q + W.\n\nGiven \u0394U = 0, then Q = -W.\n\nSo, if W = 150 J (work done by the gas, which is positive), then Q = -150 J, meaning heat is removed from the gas.\n\nTherefore, option B seems correct.\n\nBut let's see if there's any other consideration, maybe related to the specific heat capacities or anything like that.\n\nFor an isothermal process in an ideal gas, the heat transferred can also be expressed as Q = nRT * ln(Vf/Vi), where n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and Vf and Vi are the final and initial volumes, respectively.\n\nBut since the process is isothermal, and we don't have information about the number of moles or the volumes, maybe that's not the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of specific heat capacities. For an ideal gas, at constant volume, specific heat is Cv, and at constant pressure, it's Cp.\n\nBut in an isothermal process, neither volume nor pressure is constant; it's the temperature that's constant.\n\nWait, but for an ideal gas, Cv and Cp are constants, and we can relate Q to them.\n\nBut in an isothermal process, since \u0394U = 0, and for an ideal gas, \u0394U = nCv\u0394T, and since \u0394T = 0, \u0394U = 0, which confirms our earlier conclusion.\n\nSo, no, I don't think there's any need to involve Cv or Cp here.\n\nMaybe another approach: considering the efficiency of the process.\n\nBut this is a single process, not a cycle, so efficiency might not apply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps thinking about the direction of heat flow.\n\nSince the gas is doing work, it must be expanding, and to maintain constant temperature, heat must be removed to compensate for the work done.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, in this case, heat is removed from the gas.\n\nTherefore, the correct option should be B: 150 J of heat was removed from the gas.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of heat being added.\n\nSuppose heat was added to the gas: Q > 0.\n\nThen, according to \u0394U = Q + W, if Q is positive and W is positive (work done by the gas), their sum could be positive or negative depending on their magnitudes.\n\nBut in an isothermal process, \u0394U must be zero.\n\nSo, if Q > 0 and W > 0, the only way \u0394U can be zero is if Q = -W.\n\nBut in our case, W is given as 150 J, so Q must be -150 J, meaning heat is removed.\n\nTherefore, option B is correct.\n\nWait, but option C says 300 J of heat was added to the gas, and option D says 300 J was removed.\n\nWhere does the 300 J come from? Maybe there's a misunderstanding.\n\nPerhaps the problem involves some other considerations, like surroundings or something, but based on the information given, it seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a factor of 2 involved, like in calculating Q for an isothermal process, but I don't think so.\n\nNo, I think the answer is indeed option B: 150 J of heat was removed from the gas.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
