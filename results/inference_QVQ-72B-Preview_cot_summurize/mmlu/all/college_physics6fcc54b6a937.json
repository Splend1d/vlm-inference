                    "text": "So I have this problem here about two identical satellites, A and B, orbiting the Earth in circular orbits. The orbital radius of A is twice that of B, and I need to find the ratio of their angular momenta. The options are 4, 2, sqrt(2), and 1/sqrt(2). Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that angular momentum L is given by the formula L = m * v * r, where m is the mass, v is the velocity, and r is the radius of the orbit. Since both satellites are identical, their masses are the same, so the mass factor should cancel out when taking the ratio.\n\nSo, the ratio L_A / L_B would be (m * v_A * r_A) / (m * v_B * r_B) = v_A * r_A / v_B * r_B.\n\nBut I don't know the velocities of A and B. However, I do know that they are in circular orbits around the Earth, so I can relate their velocities using the laws of orbital mechanics.\n\nI recall that for a satellite in a circular orbit, the centripetal force is provided by the gravitational force. So, m * v^2 / r = G * m * M / r^2, where G is the gravitational constant, and M is the mass of the Earth.\n\nFrom this, I can solve for v: v = sqrt(G * M / r).\n\nSo, v is inversely proportional to the square root of r.\n\nTherefore, v_A = sqrt(G * M / r_A) and v_B = sqrt(G * M / r_B).\n\nGiven that r_A = 2 * r_B, I can substitute:\n\nv_A = sqrt(G * M / (2 * r_B)) and v_B = sqrt(G * M / r_B).\n\nNow, let's compute the ratio L_A / L_B:\n\nL_A / L_B = (v_A * r_A) / (v_B * r_B) = (sqrt(G * M / (2 * r_B)) * 2 * r_B) / (sqrt(G * M / r_B) * r_B).\n\nSimplify the numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: sqrt(G * M / (2 * r_B)) * 2 * r_B = 2 * r_B * (G * M / (2 * r_B))^(1/2) = 2 * r_B * sqrt(G * M) / sqrt(2 * r_B) = 2 * sqrt(G * M) * sqrt(r_B) / sqrt(2).\n\nDenominator: sqrt(G * M / r_B) * r_B = r_B * sqrt(G * M) / sqrt(r_B) = sqrt(G * M) * sqrt(r_B).\n\nSo, the ratio becomes:\n\n[2 * sqrt(G * M) * sqrt(r_B) / sqrt(2)] / [sqrt(G * M) * sqrt(r_B)] = 2 / sqrt(2).\n\nSimplify 2 / sqrt(2):\n\n2 / sqrt(2) = sqrt(4) / sqrt(2) = sqrt(4 / 2) = sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the angular momentum of A to that of B is sqrt(2).\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I know that angular momentum can also be expressed in terms of the orbital radius and the angular velocity, \u03c9. So, L = m * r^2 * \u03c9.\n\nAnd for circular orbits, \u03c9 = sqrt(G * M / r^3).\n\nSo, L = m * r^2 * sqrt(G * M / r^3) = m * r * sqrt(G * M * r) = m * r * sqrt(G * M / r).\n\nWait, that seems similar to what I had before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for circular orbits, L is also related to the total mechanical energy.\n\nBut that might be complicating things.\n\nLet me think about the relationship between angular momentum and orbital radius.\n\nAnother approach: since L = m * v * r, and v is proportional to 1/sqrt(r), then L is proportional to 1/sqrt(r).\n\nWait, no: v = sqrt(G * M / r), so L = m * sqrt(G * M / r) * r = m * sqrt(G * M * r).\n\nSo, L is proportional to sqrt(r).\n\nGiven that, if r_A = 2 * r_B, then L_A / L_B = sqrt(2 * r_B) / sqrt(r_B) = sqrt(2).\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the ratio is sqrt(2).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 4\n\nB. 2\n\nC. sqrt(2)\n\nD. 1/sqrt(2)\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. sqrt(2).\n\nI think that's solid. No further confusions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\sqrt{2}} \\]"
