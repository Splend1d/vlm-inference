                    "text": "So I have this logic problem here, and I need to construct a truth table for the argument and then determine if it's valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I have to pick a counterexample from the options provided. The argument is:\n\n~X \u2283 Y\n\nY \u2283 Z\n\n~Z / ~X\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this argument is saying. It's a conditional argument with two premises and a conclusion. The premises are:\n\n1. If not X, then Y (~X \u2283 Y)\n\n2. If Y, then Z (Y \u2283 Z)\n\nAnd the conclusion is: If not Z, then not X (~Z / ~X)\n\nWait, the conclusion is written as ~Z / ~X, which seems like it's ~Z leading to ~X. In logic, the slash might indicate a separation between premises and conclusion, but I think it's meant to be read as ~Z implies ~X.\n\nSo, the argument is:\n\nPremise 1: ~X \u2283 Y\n\nPremise 2: Y \u2283 Z\n\nConclusion: ~Z \u2283 ~X\n\nThis looks like a form of contraposition, but I need to verify it.\n\nTo construct a truth table for this argument, I need to consider all possible truth values for X, Y, and Z. Since there are three variables, there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations of truth values.\n\nLet me list all possible truth value assignments for X, Y, and Z:\n\n1. X is true, Y is true, Z is true\n\n2. X is true, Y is true, Z is false\n\n3. X is true, Y is false, Z is true\n\n4. X is true, Y is false, Z is false\n\n5. X is false, Y is true, Z is true\n\n6. X is false, Y is true, Z is false\n\n7. X is false, Y is false, Z is true\n\n8. X is false, Y is false, Z is false\n\nNow, for each of these combinations, I need to evaluate the truth values of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nLet's start with combination 1: X=T, Y=T, Z=T\n\n- Premise 1: ~X \u2283 Y \u2192 False \u2283 T \u2192 T (since ~X is F, and F \u2283 T is T)\n\n- Premise 2: Y \u2283 Z \u2192 T \u2283 T \u2192 T\n\n- Conclusion: ~Z \u2283 ~X \u2192 F \u2283 F \u2192 T (since ~Z is F and ~X is F)\n\nSo, both premises are true, and the conclusion is true.\n\nCombination 2: X=T, Y=T, Z=F\n\n- Premise 1: ~X \u2283 Y \u2192 F \u2283 T \u2192 T\n\n- Premise 2: Y \u2283 Z \u2192 T \u2283 F \u2192 F\n\n- Conclusion: ~Z \u2283 ~X \u2192 T \u2283 F \u2192 F\n\nHere, Premise 2 is false, so the argument is not applicable in this row because if a premise is false, the entire argument can't proceed. But since it's a counterexample where the premises don't hold, it's not directly relevant for validity.\n\nCombination 3: X=T, Y=F, Z=T\n\n- Premise 1: ~X \u2283 Y \u2192 F \u2283 F \u2192 T\n\n- Premise 2: Y \u2283 Z \u2192 F \u2283 T \u2192 T\n\n- Conclusion: ~Z \u2283 ~X \u2192 F \u2283 F \u2192 T\n\nAll true.\n\nCombination 4: X=T, Y=F, Z=F\n\n- Premise 1: ~X \u2283 Y \u2192 F \u2283 F \u2192 T\n\n- Premise 2: Y \u2283 Z \u2192 F \u2283 F \u2192 T\n\n- Conclusion: ~Z \u2283 ~X \u2192 T \u2283 F \u2192 F\n\nHere, Premise 1 and Premise 2 are true, but the conclusion is false. This suggests that the argument is invalid because there is a row where all premises are true and the conclusion is false.\n\nWait, but let's check the other rows to be sure.\n\nCombination 5: X=F, Y=T, Z=T\n\n- Premise 1: ~X \u2283 Y \u2192 T \u2283 T \u2192 T\n\n- Premise 2: Y \u2283 Z \u2192 T \u2283 T \u2192 T\n\n- Conclusion: ~Z \u2283 ~X \u2192 F \u2283 T \u2192 T\n\nAll true.\n\nCombination 6: X=F, Y=T, Z=F\n\n- Premise 1: ~X \u2283 Y \u2192 T \u2283 T \u2192 T\n\n- Premise 2: Y \u2283 Z \u2192 T \u2283 F \u2192 F\n\n- Conclusion: ~Z \u2283 ~X \u2192 T \u2283 T \u2192 T\n\nHere, Premise 2 is false, so again, the argument doesn't hold in this row.\n\nCombination 7: X=F, Y=F, Z=T\n\n- Premise 1: ~X \u2283 Y \u2192 T \u2283 F \u2192 F\n\n- Premise 2: Y \u2283 Z \u2192 F \u2283 T \u2192 T\n\n- Conclusion: ~Z \u2283 ~X \u2192 F \u2283 T \u2192 T\n\nIn this row, Premise 1 is false, so the argument doesn't hold.\n\nCombination 8: X=F, Y=F, Z=F\n\n- Premise 1: ~X \u2283 Y \u2192 T \u2283 F \u2192 F\n\n- Premise 2: Y \u2283 Z \u2192 F \u2283 F \u2192 T\n\n- Conclusion: ~Z \u2283 ~X \u2192 T \u2283 T \u2192 T\n\nAgain, Premise 1 is false.\n\nSo, only in combination 4 do we have all premises true and the conclusion false. Therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nNow, I need to choose which option presents a counterexample. The options are:\n\nB. Invalid. Counterexample when X, Y, and Z are true\n\nC. Invalid. Counterexample when Y and Z are true and Z is false\n\nD. Invalid. Counterexample when X is true and Y and Z are false\n\nFirst, let's look at option B: X, Y, and Z are true.\n\nFrom combination 1: X=T, Y=T, Z=T\n\nIn this case, both premises are true, and the conclusion is true. So, this is not a counterexample because the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nOption C: Y and Z are true and Z is false.\n\nWait, it says Y and Z are true and Z is false. That's confusing. If Y and Z are true, then Z is true, not false. Maybe there's a typo here.\n\nOption D: X is true and Y and Z are false.\n\nThis corresponds to combination 4: X=T, Y=F, Z=F\n\nIn this row, Premise 1 and Premise 2 are true, and the conclusion is false. This matches our earlier finding of a counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is option D: Invalid. Counterexample when X is true and Y and Z are false.\n\nBut the problem says \"choose an option which presents a counterexample.\" Since option B is not a counterexample because in that case, the conclusion is true, and option C seems to have conflicting information about Z, option D is the correct one.\n\nWait, but in combination 4, X is true, Y is false, and Z is false, which matches option D.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\nBut the question is to determine whether the argument is valid or invalid, and if invalid, choose a counterexample from the options.\n\nGiven that, and since combination 4 provides a counterexample where premises are true and conclusion is false, the argument is invalid, and the correct counterexample is option D.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
