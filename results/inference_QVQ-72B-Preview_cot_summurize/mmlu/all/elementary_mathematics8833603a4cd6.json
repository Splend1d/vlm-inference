                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a music showcase. Let's see what it's asking. There are 3 sets that are each 20 minutes long and one set that's 40 minutes long. And there's a 10-minute break between each set. The total length of the showcase is given as 3 times (20 plus 10) plus 40 minutes. I need to find out what that total is. The options are 73 minutes, 110 minutes, 130 minutes, and 210 minutes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the showcase. There are 3 sets of 20 minutes each and one set of 40 minutes. So, the performance times are:\n\nSet 1: 20 minutes\n\nSet 2: 20 minutes\n\nSet 3: 20 minutes\n\nSet 4: 40 minutes\n\nNow, there's a 10-minute break between each set. So, between Set 1 and Set 2, there's a 10-minute break; between Set 2 and Set 3, another 10-minute break; and between Set 3 and Set 4, another 10-minute break.\n\nSo, total breaks would be 3 breaks times 10 minutes each, which is 30 minutes.\n\nThe total performance time would be the sum of the set times plus the break times.\n\nSo, total time = (Set 1 + break) + (Set 2 + break) + (Set 3 + break) + Set 4.\n\nWait, actually, the breaks are between the sets, so the structure would be:\n\nSet 1 (20 min) + break (10 min) + Set 2 (20 min) + break (10 min) + Set 3 (20 min) + break (10 min) + Set 4 (40 min).\n\nSo, the total time is 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 40.\n\nLet me add those up: 20 + 10 = 30; 30 + 20 = 50; 50 + 10 = 60; 60 + 20 = 80; 80 + 10 = 90; 90 + 40 = 130 minutes.\n\nSo, the total length of the music showcase is 130 minutes.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 73 minutes\n\nB. 110 minutes\n\nC. 130 minutes\n\nD. 210 minutes\n\nSo, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The formula given is 3 times (20 + 10) plus 40 minutes.\n\nSo, 3(20 + 10) + 40 = 3(30) + 40 = 90 + 40 = 130 minutes. Yeah, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nI think the answer is 130 minutes, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{130 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
