                    "text": "So I have this question here about a 4-month-old baby playing with a rattle that gets hidden under a blanket. The baby looks at her mother instead of searching for the rattle. The question is, what concept has this child not yet developed? The options are conservation, egocentrism, hand-eye coordination, or object permanence.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means in the context of child development.\n\nStarting with conservation: I think this is related to understanding that certain properties of objects remain the same despite changes in their form or appearance. For example, if you have a ball of clay and you roll it into a long snake shape, a child who understands conservation would know that the amount of clay hasn't changed, even though the shape has. So, this seems more related to quantitative understanding and less about hiding objects under blankets.\n\nNext, egocentrism: I recall this is a concept from Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development, where children are unable to see things from another person's perspective. They think that everyone sees things the same way they do. Again, this doesn't seem directly related to the scenario of hiding a rattle under a blanket.\n\nHand-eye coordination: This refers to the ability to use your hands and eyes together in a coordinated way. For example, reaching for an object and grasping it accurately. While important, especially in infants, this doesn't directly explain why the baby looks at her mother instead of searching for the rattle.\n\nObject permanence: This is another concept from Piaget's theory, and it refers to the understanding that objects continue to exist even when they're not visible. So, if you hide a toy under a blanket, a child with object permanence would know that the toy still exists and might try to find it.\n\nGiven the scenario, the baby is playing with a rattle that's hidden under a blanket and then looks at her mother instead of searching for it. This suggests that the baby doesn't understand that the rattle still exists even though it's hidden. So, it seems like the baby hasn't developed object permanence yet.\n\nLet me double-check this. If the baby had object permanence, she might try to lift the blanket to find the rattle or show some indication that she knows it's still there. Instead, she looks at her mother, possibly expecting help or attention. This behavior indicates that she may not realize the rattle is still present under the blanket.\n\nNow, considering the age of the child\u20144 months old\u2014this makes sense. According to Piaget's stages of cognitive development, object permanence typically develops between 8 and 12 months of age. So, a 4-month-old wouldn't be expected to have fully developed object permanence.\n\nLet me consider if any of the other options could also apply to this scenario.\n\nConservation: As I thought earlier, this is more about understanding that quantities remain the same despite changes in shape or form. Hiding an object under a blanket doesn't involve changing its quantity or form, so this doesn't seem directly relevant here.\n\nEgocentrism: This is more about perspective-taking, which develops later in childhood, around the preschool years. So, a 4-month-old wouldn't have developed egocentrism yet, but the scenario doesn't involve understanding another person's perspective.\n\nHand-eye coordination: While important for motor skills, this doesn't explain the baby's reaction to the hidden object.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is that the child has not yet developed object permanence.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if hand-eye coordination could be a factor here. If the baby doesn't have the motor skills to reach under the blanket, perhaps that's why she doesn't search for the rattle. However, looking back at the question, it says she looks at her mother instead of searching for it. It doesn't specify that she tries to search but can't due to motor skill limitations. Moreover, object permanence is a cognitive concept, while hand-eye coordination is more motor-related. So, even if the baby has the cognitive understanding that the rattle is there, she might not have the motor skills to reach for it effectively. But in this case, since she looks at her mother instead of attempting to search, it suggests that she doesn't understand the rattle is still present.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the baby is surprised or confused when the rattle disappears under the blanket, and looking at her mother is a way of seeking clarification or comfort due to this confusion. This would again point towards a lack of understanding that objects continue to exist even when out of sight.\n\nI should also consider if there's any possibility that the baby has some object permanence but hasn't fully developed it yet. At 4 months, some babies might be starting to develop early signs of object permanence, but it's generally not fully formed until around 8 to 12 months.\n\nGiven all this, I still believe that object permanence is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another angle. Suppose the baby is looking at her mother because she expects her mother to produce the rattle again. In this case, the baby might have some understanding that the rattle still exists but doesn't know how to retrieve it herself. However, this still implies that the baby doesn't fully grasp object permanence, as she's relying on her mother to make the rattle reappear rather than attempting to find it herself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the baby is looking at her mother because she's learned that her mother can provide new stimuli or interactions when something disappears. But again, this doesn't necessarily indicate a lack of hand-eye coordination or conservation; it's more about object permanence.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and object permanence remains the most fitting answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D.
