                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this fraction, 27 over 36, and I need to write it in its simplest form. The options are A. 3 over 4, B. 2 over 3, C. 3 over 5, and D. 1 over 5. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on fractions, but I remember that to simplify a fraction, I need to divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, or GCD.\n\nFirst, I need to find the GCD of 27 and 36. Let's list the factors of each number.\n\nFactors of 27: 1, 3, 9, 27.\n\nFactors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.\n\nLooking at these, the common factors are 1, 3, and 9. So the greatest common divisor is 9.\n\nNow, I'll divide both the numerator and the denominator by 9.\n\n27 \u00f7 9 = 3\n\n36 \u00f7 9 = 4\n\nSo, 27 over 36 simplifies to 3 over 4.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Is there any number that can divide both 3 and 4? Well, 3 and 4 are both divisible by 1, and that's it, so 3 over 4 is indeed in its simplest form.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to simplify fractions? Maybe by canceling out common factors step by step. Let's try that approach to confirm.\n\nStarting with 27 over 36.\n\nI know that both 27 and 36 are divisible by 3.\n\n27 \u00f7 3 = 9\n\n36 \u00f7 3 = 12\n\nSo, 27 over 36 becomes 9 over 12.\n\nNow, 9 and 12 are both divisible by 3 again.\n\n9 \u00f7 3 = 3\n\n12 \u00f7 3 = 4\n\nSo, 9 over 12 simplifies to 3 over 4.\n\nAgain, 3 and 4 have no common factors other than 1, so this confirms that 3 over 4 is the simplest form.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other number that can divide both 27 and 36 besides 9. As I listed earlier, the common factors are 1, 3, and 9, so no, 9 is the largest one.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the method where I divide both numbers by the smallest prime number that divides both, which is 3, and then continue until there are no more common factors. That's essentially what I did in the step-by-step approach.\n\nAnother way is to find the GCD of 27 and 36 directly and then divide both by that number, which is what I did first.\n\nI think I've covered a couple of methods here, and both lead me to the same conclusion that 27 over 36 simplifies to 3 over 4.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 3 over 4\n\nB. 2 over 3\n\nC. 3 over 5\n\nD. 1 over 5\n\nSo, the correct answer should be A. 3 over 4.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can cross-verify using another method. Perhaps converting the fraction to a decimal or seeing if it matches any known fractions.\n\n27 over 36: if I divide 27 by 36, that's the same as 0.75. And 3 over 4 is also 0.75, so that matches perfectly.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider 2 over 3, that's approximately 0.666..., which is not equal to 0.75.\n\n3 over 5 is 0.6, which is also not 0.75.\n\n1 over 5 is 0.2, which is way off.\n\nSo, again, this confirms that A. 3 over 4 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've covered multiple ways to confirm that 27 over 36 simplifies to 3 over 4. I feel confident about this now.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\dfrac{3}{4}} \\]"
