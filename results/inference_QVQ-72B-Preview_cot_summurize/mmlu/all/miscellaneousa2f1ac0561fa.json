Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that a knish is a type of food, usually a pastry or dough that's stuffed with something and then baked or fried. It's often associated with Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, especially in New York City, where you see knish bakeries and stalls selling them.\n\nBut what's the traditional filling? Let me think about this. I recall that potato knishes are pretty common. In fact, when I think of knishes, potato is one of the first fillings that comes to mind. But is it the traditional one?\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Potato: As I said, potato knishes are widespread and seem very traditional. They're often made with mashed potato filling, sometimes with herbs or other seasonings added for flavor.\n\nB. Creamed corn: This sounds interesting, but I don't recall corn being a typical knish filling. It might be a variation, but not the traditional one.\n\nC. Lemon custard: This seems more like a dessert filling. Knishes are usually savory, not sweet, so this might not be the traditional choice.\n\nD. Raspberry jelly: Again, this is a sweet filling, and knishes are generally savory. While there might be sweet knishes, especially in some modern bakeries, I don't think raspberry jelly is the traditional filling.\n\nSo, based on this, option A. potato seems the most plausible. But just to be sure, let's think about the history of knishes.\n\nKnishes originated in Eastern Europe among Ashkenazi Jews. They were brought to the United States by immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In their traditional form, they were often filled with potato, meat, or cheese.\n\nWait a minute, so meat and cheese are also traditional fillings. But among the options given, only potato and creamed corn are listed as savory fillings, while lemon custard and raspberry jelly are sweet.\n\nGiven that knishes are primarily savory pastries, the sweet options are less likely to be traditional fillings.\n\nMoreover, cheese knishes are definitely a thing, but cheese isn't one of the options here. Meat knishes can be made with ground beef or other meats, but again, meat isn't listed.\n\nSo, by process of elimination, potato seems to be the most fitting answer.\n\nBut to double-check, I can recall that in many knish recipes and in knish shops, potato is a standard and traditional filling. It's a staple ingredient in knishes, and it's been used for generations.\n\nIn contrast, creamed corn, while it might be used in some modern variations, isn't a traditional filling that I'm aware of.\n\nAs for lemon custard and raspberry jelly, those sound more like fillings for pastries or desserts, not for knishes, which are typically savory.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is A. potato.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ potato}} \\]"
