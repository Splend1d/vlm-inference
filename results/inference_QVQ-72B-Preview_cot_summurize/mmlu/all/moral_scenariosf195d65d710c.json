                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I brought home two new kittens for my family.\"\n\nHmm, bringing home kittens. Well, kittens are cute and all, but is there anything morally wrong with bringing home new pets? I don't think so, but maybe there are some considerations here.\n\nPerhaps the person didn't ask for permission from other family members, which could cause problems if someone is allergic or doesn't want pets. Or maybe they didn't consider the responsibility of taking care of animals. But unless there's some specific context that makes it wrong, like the family can't afford to feed them or something, I think bringing home kittens is generally a nice thing, not morally wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: \"When the security guard left his post, I queried his whereabouts.\"\n\nOkay, so the security guard left his post, and someone asked where he went. Is asking about someone's whereabouts wrong? Well, it depends on the context. If the person is just curious, maybe not. But if they're trying to harm the security guard or exploit the situation for their own benefit, then yes, that could be wrong.\n\nBut assuming that the person is just asking out of concern or curiosity, I don't think that's inherently morally wrong. Maybe they're worried about the security guard's safety or just want to know where he went. Without more information, it seems like a neutral action.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Bringing home kittens \u2013 seems okay unless there's specific context that makes it wrong.\n\nScenario 2: Asking about the security guard's whereabouts \u2013 seems okay unless there's malicious intent behind the question.\n\nGiven that, I think both actions are not clearly morally wrong based on the information provided.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\" Maybe there are some cultural or legal aspects I'm missing.\n\nLet me think about the first scenario again. Bringing home pets without discussing it with the family could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if it causes inconvenience or stress to other family members. For example, if someone in the family is allergic to cats, bringing home kittens could be harmful. Or if the family wasn't ready for the responsibility of pets, it could lead to neglect or financial strain.\n\nBut again, without knowing the full context, it's hard to judge. Maybe the person discussed it with the family beforehand and everyone agreed. Or perhaps they adopted the kittens from a shelter, which is a good deed.\n\nMoving on to the second scenario. Querying the security guard's whereabouts \u2013 is there something wrong with that? If the person is asking out of concern for the guard's safety, that's commendable. If they're asking because they need assistance and can't find the guard, that's understandable.\n\nHowever, if the person is asking with the intent to commit a crime or take advantage of the situation, that's a different story. But the scenario doesn't provide any indication of malicious intent, so I can't assume that.\n\nMaybe the person is just curious, or perhaps they're checking if everything is okay since the guard left his post. In any case, asking a question doesn't seem like a morally wrong act in itself.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nIn scenario 1, bringing home kittens could be seen as irresponsible if the person didn't think through the consequences, but again, without that context, it's not clearly wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, asking about the security guard's whereabouts seems innocuous unless there's more to the story.\n\nSo, my final choice is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
