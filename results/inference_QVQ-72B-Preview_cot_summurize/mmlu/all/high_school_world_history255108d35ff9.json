                    "text": "So I've got this passage from Maximilien Robespierre, a key figure in the French Revolution, and I need to match it with one of the political principles listed. Let me read the passage again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\n\"Great purity of the French Revolution is precisely what causes both our strength and our weakness. Our strength, because it gives to us rights of the public interest over private interests; our weakness, because it rallies all vicious men against us. We must smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic or perish with it; now in this situation, the first maxim of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people's enemies by terror. Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible; it is therefore an emanation of virtue; it is not so much a special principle as it is a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to our country's most urgent needs.\"\n\nAlright, so Robespierre is talking about the purity of the French Revolution being a double-edged sword. On one hand, it empowers the public interest over private ones, which is good. On the other hand, this purity makes enemies rally against the revolution. He emphasizes the need to suppress both internal and external enemies to save the Republic.\n\nHe mentions that policy should lead the people by reason but confront enemies with terror. He defines terror as a form of justice that is quick, severe, and unwavering, and sees it as an expression of virtue, necessary for democracy in France's current crisis.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs \u2013 This sounds like a socialist or communist principle, where people contribute based on what they can and receive based on what they need. Robespierre does mention the public interest over private interests, but his focus here seems more on suppressing enemies and maintaining the revolution through terror, not on the distribution of resources.\n\nB. Might makes right \u2013 This is the idea that power or strength justifies whatever actions are taken. Robespierre is talking about terror as a form of justice and virtue, not necessarily asserting that might makes right. He believes in the righteousness of the revolution and the need for strong measures to protect it, but it's not clear if he's saying that power alone justifies the means.\n\nC. The end justifies the means \u2013 This principle suggests that the goals or outcomes of an action are more important than the methods used to achieve them. Robespierre is advocating for harsh measures like terror to protect the revolution and the Republic. He sees terror as a necessary evil, or perhaps as a virtue in the context of saving the nation. This seems plausible.\n\nD. The government is best that governs least \u2013 This is a libertarian or classical liberal idea, advocating for minimal government intervention. Robespierre, on the contrary, is advocating for strong governmental actions, like suppressing enemies through terror. This doesn't align with his views expressed in the passage.\n\nSo, between the options, C. The end justifies the means seems to be the most fitting. Robespierre is willing to use extreme measures (terror) to achieve the goal of protecting the revolution and the Republic, suggesting that the ends justify the means.\n\nBut let me think deeper. Is there another way to interpret this? For instance, could his reference to leading the people by reason align with another principle? Not really, because he specifically mentions using terror against enemies, which suggests that the methods are justified by the goal of saving the Republic.\n\nOption A is about resource distribution, which isn't the main focus here. Option B is about power justifying actions, but Robespierre seems to be grounding his actions in the idea of virtue and justice, not just power. Option D is clearly opposite to his advocacy for strong governmental actions.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. The end justifies the means.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
