The grammar is ambiguous.\n\nII. The grammar is suitable for top-down parsing.\n\nIII. The grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing.\n\nI need to determine which of these statements are true.\n\nFirst, let's understand what ambiguity means in the context of context-free grammars. A grammar is ambiguous if there exists at least one string that can be derived in more than one way, meaning it has multiple parse trees.\n\nLet me consider some strings that can be derived from this grammar and see if they have multiple parse trees.\n\nStarting with the simplest string: x.\n\nS \u2192 x\n\nThat's straightforward; only one way to derive x.\n\nNext, (x).\n\nS \u2192 ( S ) \u2192 ( x )\n\nAgain, only one way.\n\nLet's try a slightly more complex string: (x).\n\nWait, that's the same as above. Maybe I should try a string that can be derived in multiple ways.\n\nHow about (x)x? Let's see:\n\nS \u2192 ( S ) S \u2192 ( x ) S \u2192 (x) x\n\nAlternatively:\n\nS \u2192 S S \u2192 ( S ) S \u2192 (x) x\n\nHmm, that looks like the same derivation.\n\nWait, maybe I need a longer string. Let's try ((x)).\n\nS \u2192 ( S ) \u2192 ( ( S ) ) \u2192 ( ( x ) )\n\nIs there another way to derive ((x))?\n\nAlternatively:\n\nS \u2192 ( S ) \u2192 ( x )\n\nNo, that's just (x), which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I need a string with multiple symbols.\n\nLet's consider (x)(x).\n\nS \u2192 ( S ) S \u2192 ( x ) S \u2192 (x)(x)\n\nAlternatively:\n\nS \u2192 S S \u2192 ( S ) S \u2192 (x)(x)\n\nStill only one way.\n\nMaybe this grammar isn't ambiguous. I can't find a string with multiple derivations.\n\nLet me check the definition of ambiguity. A grammar is ambiguous if there exists at least one string that has more than one leftmost or rightmost derivation.\n\nFrom what I can see, all strings I've tried have only one derivation. Maybe statement I is false.\n\nMoving on to statement II: The grammar is suitable for top-down parsing.\n\nTop-down parsing typically involves leftmost derivations and works by starting with the start symbol and expanding it step by step to match the input string.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 ( S )\n\nS \u2192 x\n\nIf I try to parse (x), for example:\n\nStart with S, and S can be either ( S ) or x.\n\nLooking at the input (x), the first symbol is (, which matches the first production S \u2192 ( S ).\n\nSo, expand S to ( S ), and now compare with the input (x).\n\nNext, S should match x, since the input is x.\n\nSo, S \u2192 x matches, and the parse succeeds.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any conflict in choosing which production to use at any step, as the choice is determined by the next input symbol.\n\nTherefore, this grammar should be suitable for top-down parsing.\n\nNow, statement III: The grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing.\n\nBottom-up parsing involves reducing the input string to the start symbol by applying the reverse of the production rules, typically using rightmost derivations in reverse.\n\nLet's consider the string (x).\n\nRightmost derivation:\n\nS \u2192 ( S )\n\nS \u2192 ( x )\n\nSo, the derivation is S \u2192 ( S ) \u2192 ( x )\n\nIn bottom-up parsing, we would start from (x) and try to reduce it to S.\n\n(x) can be reduced to ( S ), using S \u2192 x, and then to S, using S \u2192 ( S ).\n\nThis seems straightforward.\n\nAnother string: ((x))\n\nRightmost derivation:\n\nS \u2192 ( S )\n\nS \u2192 ( ( S ) )\n\nS \u2192 ( ( x ) )\n\nBottom-up parsing from ((x)):\n\n((x)) can be reduced to ( ( x ) ), then to ( S ), then to S.\n\nAgain, no conflicts.\n\nSo, based on these examples, it seems this grammar is also suitable for bottom-up parsing.\n\nBut wait, I recall that for a grammar to be suitable for top-down parsing, it should be LL(k), and for bottom-up parsing, it should be LR(k). Maybe I need to check if this grammar is LL(k) or LR(k).\n\nFirst, let's recall what LL(k) and LR(k) mean.\n\nLL(k) means that for any input, by looking ahead k symbols, the parser can decide which production to use without backtracking.\n\nLR(k) is a class of grammars that can be parsed using a deterministic finite automaton that reads the input from left to right and reduces by leftmost derivations.\n\nGiven that, let's analyze the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 ( S )\n\nS \u2192 x\n\nLet's see if it's LL(1). That is, whether we can decide which production to use based on the next input symbol.\n\nIf the next input is (, then use S \u2192 ( S )\n\nIf the next input is x, then use S \u2192 x\n\nThis seems straightforward; there's no ambiguity in production choice based on the next input symbol.\n\nTherefore, it should be LL(1), and hence suitable for top-down parsing.\n\nSimilarly, for LR parsing, which is bottom-up, let's see.\n\nIn LR parsing, we look for handles in the string to reduce.\n\nFor example, parsing (x):\n\nThe string is (x)\n\nWe look for substrings that match the reverse of productions.\n\nFirst, x can be reduced to S (since S \u2192 x)\n\nThen, ( S ) can be reduced to S (since S \u2192 ( S ))\n\nSo, the reductions are unambiguous.\n\nSimilarly, for ((x)):\n\n((x)) can be reduced to ( S ), then to S.\n\nNo conflicts.\n\nTherefore, it should also be suitable for bottom-up parsing.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, statements II and III are true, and statement I is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. II and III only.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs the grammar ambiguous? From my earlier attempts, I couldn't find any string with multiple derivations. So, probably not ambiguous.\n\nIs it suitable for top-down parsing? Yes, as it's LL(1).\n\nIs it suitable for bottom-up parsing? Yes, as the reductions are deterministic.\n\nHence, the answer is D. II and III only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
