                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out how many rooms the palace at Knossos had at its peak. The options are 100, 500, 1,000, or 5,000 rooms. Hmm, that's a pretty wide range. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst off, I know that Knossos is an ancient palace on the island of Crete, and it's associated with the Minoan civilization. I remember learning about it in history class. It's famous for its intricate layout, and there's even a myth about it being connected to the Minotaur and the labyrinth.\n\nBut seriously, how many rooms would such a palace have? I mean, it was a significant center of civilization, so it must have been pretty substantial. Let's see if I can recall any specific numbers from my studies.\n\nI think I read somewhere that the palace at Knossos was quite extensive, with many interconnected rooms and courtyards. It was designed for both residential purposes and ceremonial events, so that would require a lot of space.\n\nLet me consider the size of similar ancient palaces. For example, Versailles in France had about 2,100 rooms, but that's from a much later period. What about the Pyramids? Wait, the Pyramids are tombs, not palaces. Maybe I should look at other ancient palaces like Babylon or Egyptian palaces, but I don't recall their exact room counts.\n\nPerhaps I should think in terms of the population it supported. If Knossos was the capital of the Minoan civilization, it probably housed the royal family, administrators, priests, and possibly parts of the population. But estimating the population back then is tricky.\n\nAnother angle: the palace at Knossos is known for its advanced engineering, like ventilation systems and water management. Maybe the complexity of the building could hint at the number of rooms.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can think about the palace's layout. I recall that it had a central court surrounded by various wings and buildings, with multiple floors and light wells. This kind of design might suggest a large number of rooms.\n\nLet me try to visualize it. If each room is, say, 20 square meters, then a palace with 100 rooms would be 2,000 square meters, which seems small for such an important site. 500 rooms would be 10,000 square meters, which is larger but still maybe not big enough. 1,000 rooms would be 20,000 square meters, and 5,000 rooms would be 100,000 square meters, which seems enormous.\n\nBut I need to consider that ancient palaces often included storage rooms, workshops, and other functional spaces, not just living quarters. So maybe the number of rooms was higher than I initially thought.\n\nAlso, considering that the palace underwent several periods of expansion and renovation, it might have accumulated a large number of rooms over time.\n\nI think I need to make an educated guess here. Between 100 and 5,000 rooms is a big range. Let me see if I can eliminate some options.\n\n100 rooms seems too few for a palace of such significance. 500 might be possible, but I have a feeling it's higher. 1,000 seems plausible, and 5,000 seems maybe too much.\n\nWait, maybe I can look up some references. Oh, right, I'm doing this as if I'm taking the test, so I can't use external sources. Okay, back to thinking.\n\nLet me consider the fact that the palace at Knossos is one of the largest Bronze Age sites in Crete, and it's often referred to as a labyrinth due to its complexity. That might imply a very large number of rooms.\n\nBut is it possible that it had as many as 5,000 rooms? That seems excessive even for a major palace. I think I'll rule out the 5,000 option.\n\nBetween 100 and 1,000, I need to choose. Maybe I should split the difference and go with 500. But I have a nagging feeling that it's higher than that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the palace's function. If it was a center of administration and ceremony, it might have had numerous rooms for officials, storage of goods, and perhaps even housing for the elite.\n\nAlso, considering that the palace had multiple levels and was built over a significant area, it's possible that it contained a thousand or more rooms.\n\nI think I'll go with option C, 1,000 rooms. It seems like a reasonable estimate based on what I know about the palace at Knossos and its importance in Minoan civilization.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1000} \\]"
