                    "text": "So I have this problem here about helium atoms and their ionization energies. It says that the energy required to remove both electrons from a helium atom in its ground state is 79.0 eV, and it's asking how much energy is required to ionize helium, which means removing just one electron. The options are A. 24.6 eV, B. 39.5 eV, C. 51.8 eV, and D. 54.4 eV.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked here. Ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom, right? So, if helium has two electrons, and we remove one, that should be less energy than removing both. Makes sense. But it's not just half, I don't think.\n\nLet me recall some basic atomic structure. Helium is a noble gas, and in its ground state, it has two electrons in the 1s orbital. The energy to remove the first electron should be less than the energy to remove the second one because once one electron is removed, the remaining electron is closer to the nucleus and feels a stronger nuclear charge, so it's held more tightly.\n\nSo, the energy to remove the first electron is the first ionization energy, and the energy to remove the second electron is the second ionization energy. The total energy to remove both electrons is the sum of the first and second ionization energies.\n\nGiven that, the total energy to remove both electrons is 79.0 eV. So, I need to find the first ionization energy, which is just for removing one electron.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nI1 = first ionization energy\n\nI2 = second ionization energy\n\nI1 + I2 = 79.0 eV\n\nI need to find I1.\n\nBut I don't have I2. Maybe I can find a relationship between I1 and I2 or look up some standard values.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the Bohr model or some other atomic theory to relate I1 and I2.\n\nLet me think about the Bohr model for hydrogen. For hydrogen, the ionization energy is given by:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n\u00b2\n\nWhere n is the principal quantum number.\n\nBut helium has two electrons, so it's not exactly like hydrogen.\n\nWait, but once one electron is removed, the remaining electron feels an effective nuclear charge of +1, similar to hydrogen.\n\nSo, the first electron is in helium, which has atomic number Z = 2, so its energy is:\n\nE1 = -13.6 eV * (Z / n)\u00b2 = -13.6 eV * (2 / 1)\u00b2 = -13.6 eV * 4 = -54.4 eV\n\nSo, the energy to remove the first electron would be 54.4 eV.\n\nBut that's not matching with any of the options directly.\n\nWait, option D is 54.4 eV, but that seems too straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the second electron has a different energy.\n\nWait, but according to the Bohr model, for a one-electron system, like He+, the energy levels are scaled by Z\u00b2.\n\nSo, for He+, Z = 2, so the ionization energy should be:\n\nI2 = 13.6 eV * (2)\u00b2 = 13.6 eV * 4 = 54.4 eV\n\nWait, but that would mean I2 is also 54.4 eV.\n\nBut the total energy to remove both electrons is 79.0 eV.\n\nSo, if I1 + I2 = 79.0 eV, and I2 is 54.4 eV, then I1 would be 79.0 - 54.4 = 24.6 eV.\n\nWait, but option A is 24.6 eV.\n\nBut that seems contradictory because according to the Bohr model, both electrons should have the same ionization energy, which is not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nLet me check the ionization energies of helium.\n\nI recall that the first ionization energy of helium is around 24.6 eV, and the second is around 54.4 eV, totaling about 79.0 eV.\n\nWait, that seems to align with the options.\n\nSo, if I1 is 24.6 eV and I2 is 54.4 eV, their sum is indeed 79.0 eV.\n\nBut according to the Bohr model, shouldn't both electrons have the same ionization energy?\n\nWait, no. The Bohr model is for hydrogen-like atoms, where there's only one electron. Helium has two electrons, so they interact with each other, and the energy levels are different.\n\nSo, perhaps the Bohr model isn't directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of electrostatic potential energy.\n\nThe energy to remove the first electron is the energy required to overcome the attraction between the electron and the nucleus, considering the other electron's shielding.\n\nSimilarly, once one electron is removed, the remaining electron feels a full +2 nuclear charge without shielding from another electron, so it's held more tightly.\n\nTherefore, I2 should be higher than I1.\n\nGiven that, and knowing that the total is 79.0 eV, if I assume I2 is 54.4 eV, then I1 would be 24.6 eV, which matches option A.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because earlier I thought that the first ionization energy should be lower, but according to the Bohr model for hydrogen-like atoms, it seems higher.\n\nWait, for hydrogen, the ionization energy is 13.6 eV, but for helium, it's higher due to the higher nuclear charge.\n\nBut in reality, the first ionization energy of helium is indeed around 24.6 eV, and the second is around 54.4 eV.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is A. 24.6 eV.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the first electron is in a higher energy state due to electron-electron repulsion, so its ionization energy is less than that of the second electron.\n\nWait, but in the ground state, both electrons are in the 1s orbital, but due to the Pauli exclusion principle, they have opposite spins, which minimizes repulsion somewhat.\n\nBut still, the first electron is easier to remove because the second electron is shielded by the first one from the full nuclear charge.\n\nTherefore, I1 should be less than I2, which aligns with the values I mentioned earlier.\n\nSo, if I1 is 24.6 eV and I2 is 54.4 eV, their sum is 79.0 eV, which matches the given information.\n\nTherefore, the energy required to ionize helium, i.e., to remove one electron, is 24.6 eV.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 24.6 eV.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there a formula or a way to calculate the first ionization energy of helium without relying on memorized values?\n\nWell, perhaps using the hydrogenic model, where for a multi-electron atom, the energy levels can be approximated by considering the effective nuclear charge, Z_eff.\n\nFor helium, the effective nuclear charge for the first electron is Z_eff = 2 - 0.3, approximately, due to shielding by the other electron.\n\nSo, Z_eff \u2248 1.7\n\nThen, the ionization energy would be:\n\nI1 \u2248 13.6 eV * (Z_eff)^2 / n^2\n\nFor the first electron in the 1s orbital, n = 1.\n\nSo, I1 \u2248 13.6 eV * (1.7)^2 = 13.6 eV * 2.89 \u2248 39.3 eV\n\nWait, that's close to option B. 39.5 eV.\n\nBut earlier, using known ionization energies, I got 24.6 eV.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nI think the shielding approximation isn't very accurate for such a small atom like helium.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to consider the actual ionization energies.\n\nLooking up standard ionization energies for helium:\n\nFirst ionization energy (I1) = 24.587 eV\n\nSecond ionization energy (I2) = 54.417 eV\n\nTotal to remove both electrons: 24.587 + 54.417 = 79.004 eV\n\nWhich matches the given total of 79.0 eV.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is indeed A. 24.6 eV.\n\nI must have made a mistake in my earlier calculation using the effective nuclear charge.\n\nPerhaps the shielding constant for helium is different, but in any case, the actual value is around 24.6 eV.\n\nSo, the energy required to ionize helium is 24.6 eV.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 24.6\\ \\text{eV}} \\]"
