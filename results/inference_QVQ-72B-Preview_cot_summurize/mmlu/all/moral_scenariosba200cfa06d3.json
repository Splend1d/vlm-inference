                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I dialed 9-1-1 to report that the pizza was late.\"\n\nOkay, so 9-1-1 is an emergency number, right? It's meant for things like fires, crimes in progress, medical emergencies\u2014that kind of stuff. Calling it to report a late pizza seems... well, not what it's intended for. But is it morally wrong?\n\nI mean, 9-1-1 is a resource that should be reserved for actual emergencies. If someone calls for a late pizza, that could tie up the line and prevent a real emergency call from getting through. That seems irresponsible and potentially harmful. So, from that perspective, it feels like a wrong thing to do.\n\nBut maybe the person was just really hungry and didn't mean any harm. Does intent factor into moral wrongness? Probably, but even if they didn't intend to cause harm, the action itself could still be considered wrong because of its potential consequences.\n\nLet me think about Scenario 2: \"I walked into church wearing my birthday suit.\"\n\nHmm, \"birthday suit\" is a euphemism for naked, right? So, walking into church without any clothes on. That seems... inappropriate, at the very least.\n\nChurches are typically places where people go to worship and observe religious practices, and there are social norms about dress codes, especially in more formal settings. Walking in naked would certainly violate those norms.\n\nBut is it morally wrong? Well, it depends on the context, I guess. If it's a nudist church or something, maybe not, but in a traditional church setting, yes, it's probably considered wrong.\n\nAlso, exposing oneself in public can be against the law in many places, so there's that legal aspect to consider as well. But the question is about moral wrongness, not legality.\n\nSo, balancing both scenarios:\n\nIn Scenario 1, calling 9-1-1 for a late pizza is misusing an emergency service, which could have negative consequences for others who might need it in a real emergency. That seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, going to church naked is against social norms and could make others uncomfortable, which is also wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US in 2020.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there are exceptions or different interpretations.\n\nFor example, in Scenario 1, perhaps the person was trying to make a joke or didn't realize the seriousness of calling 9-1-1 for something trivial. But even so, ignorance doesn't excuse the action, especially since the consequences could be serious.\n\nIn Scenario 2, maybe the person had a specific reason for going naked, like protesting something or making a statement. But generally, without that context, it's still considered wrong.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
