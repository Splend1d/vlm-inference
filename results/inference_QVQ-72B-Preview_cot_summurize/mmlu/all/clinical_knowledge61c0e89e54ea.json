                    "text": "So I have this question about Addison's Disease, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let me see, Addison's Disease is something related to the adrenal glands, right? I think it's when the adrenal cortex doesn't produce enough hormones. But let me make sure.\n\nOption A says it's due to a deficiency of prolactin hormone. Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland, and I think it's involved in milk production in women. But Addison's Disease is about the adrenal cortex, so that doesn't seem directly related. Maybe this is a distractor.\n\nOption B says it leads to generalized pigmentation. I recall that people with Addison's Disease often have increased skin darkness, like tanning, even if they haven't been in the sun. Is that because of increased melanin production? Maybe the body tries to produce more hormones and ends up stimulating melanin as well. That sounds plausible.\n\nOption C says it's a recognized cause of hypertension. Hypertension is high blood pressure. In Addison's Disease, I think blood pressure can be low because of mineralocorticoid deficiency, like aldosterone, which helps regulate blood pressure. So, if anything, Addison's might be associated with low blood pressure, not high.\n\nOption D says diabetes is a complication. Diabetes is usually type 1 or type 2, related to insulin and glucose metabolism. Addison's Disease is about adrenal hormones, like cortisol, which affects glucose too, but I think having too little cortisol might actually make it harder to regulate blood sugar, but I don't think it directly causes diabetes.\n\nHmm, let me think again. Addison's Disease is characterized by insufficient production of cortisol and aldosterone by the adrenal glands. Cortisol is important for regulating blood sugar levels, metabolism, and responding to stress, while aldosterone helps regulate sodium and potassium levels in the body, which affects blood pressure.\n\nSo, if there's a deficiency in aldosterone, blood pressure might drop, which contradicts option C about hypertension. So, option C is probably false.\n\nOption A mentions prolactin deficiency. Prolactin is from the pituitary gland, not the adrenals, so that seems unrelated to Addison's Disease. Therefore, option A is likely incorrect.\n\nOption B mentions generalized pigmentation. I remember that in Addison's Disease, there can be increased pigmentation because the body produces more melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) in response to low cortisol levels. This increased MSH leads to darker skin pigmentation. So, this seems to be a true statement.\n\nOption D says diabetes is a complication. While it's true that both conditions can affect glucose metabolism, Addison's Disease is more about cortisol deficiency, which can affect glucose regulation, but it's not the same as type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In fact, people with Addison's Disease might have low blood sugar levels because cortisol helps raise blood sugar during stress or fasting. So, it's unlikely that Addison's Disease directly causes diabetes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: leads to generalized pigmentation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
