                    "text": "So I have this question: \"What city is known as 'the rubber capital of the world'?\" and the options are Omaha, Nebraska; Rockford, Illinois; Grand Rapids, Michigan; and Akron, Ohio. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these cities is famous for rubber production.\n\nFirst off, I know that the rubber industry was really important in the early 20th century, especially with the rise of the automobile industry. Companies like Goodyear and Firestone were big players back then, and they were based in certain cities that became hubs for rubber manufacturing.\n\nLet me think about Goodyear. I believe Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company was founded in Akron, Ohio, right? If that's the case, maybe Akron has a claim to being the rubber capital. But I should check about the other cities too, just to be sure.\n\nOmaha, Nebraska, is more known for being a transportation hub, isn't it? I think there's a big railroad presence there, and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is headquartered there. But I don't recall any significant rubber manufacturing in Omaha.\n\nRockford, Illinois, is a city in northern Illinois, not too far from Chicago. I know it's got some manufacturing, but again, I don't specifically remember anything about rubber production there.\n\nGrand Rapids, Michigan, is often associated with furniture making and design. It's called the \"furniture capital of the world\" or something like that. So, again, probably not the rubber capital.\n\nThat brings me back to Akron, Ohio. I did some quick research earlier, and I found out that Akron was indeed a major center for rubber production in the United States. In fact, during the early 1900s, Akron was home to four of the top tire and rubber companies: Goodyear, Firestone, General Tire, and B.F. Goodrich.\n\nBecause of this concentration of rubber-related industries, Akron became known as the \"Rubber Capital of the World.\" The city's economy was heavily tied to the rubber industry, and it played a crucial role in the development of automotive tires and other rubber products.\n\nOver time, the rubber industry in Akron has evolved. Some companies have moved their headquarters or manufacturing facilities elsewhere, but the legacy of the rubber industry is still felt in the city. There are museums and historical sites that celebrate this part of Akron's history.\n\nSo, based on this information, it seems pretty clear that Akron, Ohio, is the city known as the rubber capital of the world. The other options\u2014Omaha, Rockford, and Grand Rapids\u2014don't have the same level of historical significance in the rubber industry.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll see if there's any possibility that one of the other cities also had a prominent role in rubber production. For example, maybe Grand Rapids had some rubber factories at one point, but from what I know, its main industry was furniture making.\n\nSimilarly, Rockford seems to have been involved in various manufacturing sectors, but nothing specifically related to rubber. And Omaha, while a major transportation hub, doesn't have a reputation for rubber production.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is Akron, Ohio. It's the city that was at the heart of the rubber industry in the United States and earned the title of \"the rubber capital of the world.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D.
