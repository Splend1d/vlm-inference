                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about urban U.S. settings and where you'd expect to find planned communities. The options are ghettos, suburbs, CBDs, and transition zones. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a planned community is. From what I recall, a planned community is a type of residential development where the layout and design are carefully thought out and controlled by a developer or a community association. These places often have specific rules and regulations to maintain a certain look and feel, like uniform housing styles, shared amenities, and maybe even restrictions on things like fence colors or satellite dishes.\n\nSo, with that in mind, I need to think about which of these urban settings is most likely to have such organized and planned residential areas.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with ghettos. I know that ghettos are areas where a particular group, often defined by race or ethnicity, is concentrated due to social, economic, or sometimes legal factors. These areas aren't typically planned in the sense of having a unified design or set of regulations imposed by a developer. Instead, they develop organically over time as people move in and out, and properties are bought and sold. So, I don't think ghettos are where you'd find planned communities.\n\nNext, suburbs. Suburbs are residential areas on the outskirts of a city, often characterized by single-family homes, more space, and a quieter lifestyle compared to the city center. Many suburbs were developed in the post-World War II era when there was a surge in housing demand. Developers would purchase large tracts of land and build hundreds of homes at once, sometimes with similar designs to keep costs down. This sounds a bit like planned communities, doesn't it?\n\nMoreover, some suburbs have homeowners' associations (HOAs) that enforce rules about property maintenance, exterior changes, and sometimes even behavior. These HOAs help maintain the consistency and appeal of the neighborhood, which aligns with the concept of a planned community.\n\nSo, suburbs seem like a strong candidate for where planned communities are found.\n\nNow, CBDs, which stand for Central Business Districts. These are the commercial hubs of cities, where you find tall buildings, offices, retailers, and maybe some apartment buildings mixed in. CBDs are primarily focused on business and commerce, not residential living. While there might be some residential areas nearby or even within the CBD, they're not typically planned communities in the sense described. So, probably not the answer.\n\nLastly, transition zones. I think of transition zones as areas that are in flux, perhaps changing from residential to commercial use or vice versa. These areas can be diverse and less organized, with a mix of building types and land uses. They might not have the same level of planning and regulation as a planned community.\n\nPutting it all together, suburbs seem to be the most likely place to find planned communities. They often have master plans, homeowners' associations, and a unified aesthetic that fits the definition of a planned community.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think of an example. Take Levittown, New York, which was one of the first large-scale planned communities in the U.S. It was built after World War II and consisted of thousands of similar-looking houses, all designed and constructed under a single plan. That sounds very much like a suburb.\n\nAnother example is planned unit developments (PUDs), which are commonly found in suburban areas. PUDs are communities where the development is planned holistically, including both residential and possibly commercial elements, with an emphasis on open spaces and community amenities.\n\nSo, based on this, I'm confident that suburbs are the correct choice here.\n\nTo sum it up, in the urban U.S. setting, planned communities are most commonly found in suburbs. This is because suburbs often have a history of being developed according to comprehensive plans by developers, and they frequently have homeowners' associations that enforce regulations to maintain the neighborhood's character.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B.
