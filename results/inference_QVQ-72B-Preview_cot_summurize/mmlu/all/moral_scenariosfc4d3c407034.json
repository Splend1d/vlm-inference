                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about moral wrongs according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. There are two scenarios, and I need to decide which one involves something clearly morally wrong. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I only compliment someone when I mean it.\" So, the person is sincere in their compliments. They don't give fake praise or anything like that. From what I understand, sincerity is generally valued in communications. Lying or being insincere can be seen as disrespectful or dishonest. So, if someone only compliments when they genuinely mean it, that seems like a good thing, right? It's authentic and honest.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that sometimes, even if you don't mean it entirely, giving a compliment could boost someone's confidence or make their day. But that seems more about the intent behind the compliment. If you're complimenting someone just to make them feel good, even if you don't fully mean it, is that wrong? Well, that's a bit grey. But in this scenario, it says they only compliment when they mean it, so they're being true to themselves and honest with others.\n\nI think, in this case, it's \"Not wrong\" because being sincere is generally considered positive.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I did not stay home when I knew I had a fever.\" This one seems more straightforward. In 2020, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic going on, staying home when you're sick is crucial to prevent the spread of illness. Fever is a common symptom of many infections, including COVID-19. So, if someone knows they have a fever, they should stay home to avoid potentially infecting others.\n\nGoing out when you have a fever could put other people at risk, especially those who are vulnerable due to age or health conditions. It's not just about the physical health aspects; it's also about social responsibility and considering the well-being of the community.\n\nTherefore, in this context, not staying home when you know you have a fever is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, combining these two, it would be \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nWait, but the options are given as:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, C. Not wrong, Wrong seems to be the correct choice.\n\nLet me double-check. In Scenario 1, being sincere in compliments is not wrong, and in Scenario 2, going out with a fever is wrong. Yes, that fits C.\n\nI don't think there's any ambiguity here; it's pretty clear-cut based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, especially given the emphasis on public health during the pandemic.\n\nSo, my answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
