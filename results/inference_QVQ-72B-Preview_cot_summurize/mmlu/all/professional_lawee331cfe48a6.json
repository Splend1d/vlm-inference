The university contacted a coach who had a strong reputation as a person who cottld \"turn around\" a program and produce winning teams. The university offered the coach an annual salary of $250,000 to coach its basketball team, but the coach declined the offer, hoping to find another institution that would pay him a higher salary. Thereafter, a wealthy booster, who was interested in enhancing the university's basketball program, contacted the coach and told him that if he would sign a coaching contract with the university, the booster would pay him $50,000 a year as an unpublished supplement to his salary. Furthermore, the booster promised to contribute $5,000 to the university athletic fund every time the basketball team won a game under the coach's tutelage. The coach thereupon signed a three-year contract as the head basketball coach at the university at an annual salary of $250,000. During the coach's first year as coach, the university basketball team compiled a record of 18 wins and 12 losses. The booster, however, refused to pay anything to either the coach or the university athletic fund. Assume that the agreement between the coach and the booster does not violate any rule of the university or of any intercollegiate athletic association. The university brought suit against the booster to recover $90,000 for breach of his promise to pay $5,000 into the athletic fund for each game won by the basketball team. Is it likely that the university will prevail in this contract action?\n\nA. Yes, because the university is an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract between the coach and the booster.\nB. Yes, because the university detrimentally relied on the booster's promise by hiring the coach.\nC. No, because the booster's promise was, in essence, an illegal form of procurement and void as against public policy.\nD. No, because the booster's promise was made to the coach rather than to the university and, therefore, was not a charitable subscription.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a university, a basketball coach, and a wealthy booster. Let me try to wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst off, the university fires their basketball coach because they've had a string of losing seasons. They offer a new coach $250,000 a year, but he turns it down, hoping for a better deal elsewhere. Then, this booster\u2014who wants to improve the basketball program\u2014contacts the coach and says, \"If you sign with the university, I'll give you an extra $50,000 a year, and I'll also give $5,000 to the university's athletic fund for every game the team wins under your coaching.\"\n\nSo, the coach signs a three-year contract for $250,000 a year. During the first year, the team wins 18 games and loses 12. But then, the booster refuses to pay anything to either the coach or the university. Now, the university is suing the booster for $90,000, which is $5,000 times 18 wins.\n\nThe question is, will the university likely prevail in this contract action? And there are four options:\n\nA. Yes, because the university is an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract between the coach and the booster.\n\nB. Yes, because the university detrimentally relied on the booster's promise by hiring the coach.\n\nC. No, because the booster's promise was, in essence, an illegal form of procurement and void as against public policy.\n\nD. No, because the booster's promise was made to the coach rather than to the university and, therefore, was not a charitable subscription.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the parties. The booster made a promise to the coach: extra money to the coach and contributions to the university athletic fund based on the number of wins.\n\nThe coach signs the contract with the university based on this promise from the booster. Now, the booster is refusing to pay up, and the university is trying to collect the $90,000 he promised for the 18 wins.\n\nOption A says the university is an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract between the coach and the booster.\n\nHmm, third-party beneficiary contracts are when a contract is made for the benefit of someone who isn't a party to the contract. So, if the booster and the coach had a contract that included a promise to pay money to the university, the university could be considered a third-party beneficiary.\n\nBut wait, the booster's promise was directly to the coach, not to the university. The coach was the one who was supposed to benefit directly from the booster's promise of extra money and the contributions to the athletic fund.\n\nHowever, the university might argue that the booster's promise was intended to benefit them, since the contributions were specifically to the athletic fund for each win. So, maybe they are an intended beneficiary.\n\nBut, typically, in third-party beneficiary contracts, there needs to be clear intent that the third party was to benefit from the contract. Here, the booster's promise was to the coach, and the contributions to the athletic fund were tied to the team's performance under the coach's tutelage.\n\nMaybe the university can argue that the booster's promise included them as a beneficiary, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nOption B says yes, because the university detrimentally relied on the booster's promise by hiring the coach.\n\nDetrimental reliance, or promissory estoppel, occurs when someone reasonably relies on a promise to their detriment.\n\nIn this case, did the university rely on the booster's promise to hire the coach? The booster made the promise to the coach, not directly to the university. The university offered the coach $250,000, and he accepted, knowing he'd get an extra $50,000 from the booster.\n\nDid the university know about the booster's promise? The problem doesn't specify. If the university was aware of the booster's promise, then maybe they relied on the additional funding when hiring the coach.\n\nBut, if they didn't know, then it's harder to argue that they detrimentally relied on the booster's promise.\n\nOption C says no, because the booster's promise was illegal and against public policy.\n\nHmm, the problem mentions that the agreement doesn't violate any university or intercollegiate athletic association rules. So, unless there's some other law being violated, it seems like the agreement is lawful.\n\nBut, perhaps there's an issue with the booster paying extra money to the coach on top of his salary from the university. Could that be considered an improper inducement or some kind of unethical practice?\n\nThe problem states that the agreement doesn't violate any rules, so maybe not. Unless there's some unwritten rule or public policy against such arrangements, this option might not hold.\n\nOption D says no, because the promise was made to the coach, not to the university, and therefore it's not a charitable subscription.\n\nCharitable subscriptions typically involve promises to give money to a charity or nonprofit organization.\n\nHere, the university is a nonprofit educational institution, and the athletic fund is likely part of its broader funding.\n\nBut, the booster's promise was to pay $5,000 to the athletic fund for each win, which seems like a charitable contribution tied to a specific condition.\n\nHowever, the issue is whether the university can enforce the booster's promise since it was made to the coach, not directly to the university.\n\nSo, perhaps the university isn't in a position to enforce the promise because it wasn't a direct party to the agreement between the booster and the coach.\n\nBut, if the booster had made the promise directly to the university, then it would be enforceable.\n\nWait, but the booster did promise to pay $5,000 to the athletic fund for each win. So, even if the promise was made through the coach, maybe the university can step in and enforce it.\n\nBut, generally, contracts are between the parties who made them, and third parties can't enforce them unless they're intended beneficiaries.\n\nGoing back to option A, if the university is an intended third-party beneficiary, then they can enforce the promise.\n\nBut, I need to see if that's the case here.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose the booster had said to the coach, \"I'll pay $5,000 to the athletic fund for each win,\" and the coach agreed to that. Then, when the booster didn't pay, the university steps in to enforce the promise.\n\nIs the university in a position to enforce this promise?\n\nWell, in contract law, if a promise is made for the benefit of a third party, that third party can sometimes enforce it.\n\nBut, typically, the third party needs to be an intended beneficiary, not just an incidental beneficiary.\n\nAn intended beneficiary is someone whom the parties to the contract intended to benefit, while an incidental beneficiary is someone who just happens to benefit from the contract.\n\nIn this case, the booster promised to pay $5,000 to the athletic fund for each win under the coach's tutelage. So, the university's athletic fund was directly targeted to receive the money.\n\nTherefore, it seems like the university was an intended beneficiary of this promise.\n\nSo, option A might be correct.\n\nOption B, detrimental reliance, might also be a possibility if the university knew about the promise and relied on it when hiring the coach.\n\nBut, without knowing whether the university was aware of the booster's promise, it's hard to say.\n\nOption C suggests that the promise is against public policy, but the problem states that the agreement doesn't violate any rules of the university or intercollegiate athletic association. Unless there's some other public policy consideration, this option seems unlikely.\n\nOption D argues that the promise was made to the coach, not to the university, and therefore it's not a charitable subscription. But, since the promise was to pay money to the university's athletic fund, which is a charitable organization, it could be considered a charitable subscription.\n\nHowever, the main issue is whether the university can enforce the promise, given that it was made through the coach.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the university was intended to receive the money directly for each win, it seems that the university is an intended third-party beneficiary.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A: yes, because the university is an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract between the coach and the booster.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
