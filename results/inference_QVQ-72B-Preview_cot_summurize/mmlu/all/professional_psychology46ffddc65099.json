                    "text": "Let's see here. I'm trying to understand this question about changing the cutoff score for a selection test in hiring. So, the personnel director decides to raise the cutoff score. I need to figure out why she might be doing that, based on the options given.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives mean in this context.\n\nA true positive would be someone who scores above the cutoff and is indeed qualified for the job.\n\nA false positive would be someone who scores above the cutoff but is actually not qualified.\n\nA false negative would be someone who scores below the cutoff but is actually qualified.\n\nA true negative would be someone who scores below the cutoff and is indeed not qualified.\n\nNow, if the personnel director raises the cutoff score, what's likely to happen to these categories?\n\nRaising the cutoff means that only applicants who score higher will be considered for hiring. This should reduce the number of people who are being considered but aren't actually qualified, right? So, that sounds like decreasing false positives.\n\nBut let's think about each option:\n\nA. Increase the number of true positives.\n\nIf we raise the cutoff, might we be increasing the number of true positives? Well, if the test is valid, raising the cutoff might include more highly qualified candidates, thus increasing true positives. But I'm a bit unsure because it could also exclude some true positives who just miss the higher cutoff.\n\nB. Decrease the number of false positives.\n\nThis seems plausible. By raising the cutoff, we're making it harder to pass, so fewer unqualified candidates might slip through. So, fewer false positives.\n\nC. Increase the number of false negatives.\n\nIf we raise the cutoff, some qualified candidates might now score below it and be incorrectly rejected. So, this could increase false negatives.\n\nD. Decrease the number of true negatives.\n\nIf we raise the cutoff, more unqualified candidates will be correctly rejected, so true negatives might decrease because fewer candidates are scoring below the new higher cutoff.\n\nWait, that seems counterintuitive. If we raise the cutoff, more candidates will score below it, including unqualified ones, so true negatives might actually increase, not decrease.\n\nHmm, I think I might have misinterpreted option D.\n\nLet me try to rephrase:\n\n- True positives: qualified candidates scoring above cutoff.\n\n- False positives: unqualified candidates scoring above cutoff.\n\n- False negatives: qualified candidates scoring below cutoff.\n\n- True negatives: unqualified candidates scoring below cutoff.\n\nIf the cutoff is raised, assuming the test is valid:\n\n- Fewer candidates will score above the cutoff, including both true positives and false positives.\n\n- More candidates will score below the cutoff, including both false negatives and true negatives.\n\nSo, raising the cutoff would likely decrease both true positives and false positives, while increasing both false negatives and true negatives.\n\nGiven that, option A (increase true positives) seems unlikely.\n\nOption B (decrease false positives) seems possible because fewer unqualified candidates are passing the higher cutoff.\n\nOption C (increase false negatives) seems likely because some qualified candidates are now scoring below the higher cutoff.\n\nOption D (decrease true negatives) seems unlikely based on the above reasoning.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"most likely the personnel director has made this decision in order to...\" and then gives the options. It's asking for the director's intention, not necessarily the direct consequence.\n\nSo, perhaps the director wants to decrease false positives\u2014meaning they want to reduce hiring unqualified candidates by making sure only the top scorers are considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want to increase true positives\u2014hire more highly qualified candidates.\n\nBut if they raise the cutoff too high, they might exclude some qualified candidates who just miss the higher cutoff, thus potentially decreasing true positives.\n\nI think the primary intention of raising the cutoff is to decrease false positives\u2014meaning to reduce the chance of hiring unqualified candidates by setting a higher bar.\n\nIncreasing false negatives might be an unintended consequence, as some qualified candidates might be excluded.\n\nSo, between the options, B. decrease the number of false positives seems the most plausible reason for raising the cutoff.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nSuppose the director wants to increase true positives. Would raising the cutoff achieve that? Possibly, but it might also exclude some qualified candidates who don't meet the higher cutoff. So, it's not guaranteed to increase true positives; it might actually decrease them if too many qualified candidates are being excluded.\n\nSimilarly, increasing false negatives would mean more qualified candidates are being rejected, which is generally not desirable.\n\nDecreasing true negatives doesn't seem directly relevant to the decision to raise the cutoff, as true negatives are unqualified candidates correctly rejected, and we want to maximize that.\n\nTherefore, the most logical reason for raising the cutoff is to decrease false positives\u2014hiring unqualified candidates.\n\nSo, my answer is B. decrease the number of false positives.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
