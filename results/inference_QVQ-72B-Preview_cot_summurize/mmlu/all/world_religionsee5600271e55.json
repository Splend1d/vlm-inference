                    "text": "So I'm trying to answer this question: \"What does the term 'Qur'an' literally mean?\" And the options are A. The Holy Book, B. The Narrative, C. The Recitation, D. The Pillars. Hmm, I think I have some knowledge about this, but I want to make sure I get it right.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Qur'an is a central religious text in Islam, believed to be revealed by God to the Prophet Muhammad. It's kind of like the Bible in Christianity or the Torah in Judaism, but it's specific to Islam. Now, the term \"Qur'an\" itself, I believe, comes from the Arabic language, and Arabic is the original language of the Qur'an.\n\nLet me think about the meaning of \"Qur'an.\" I recall that in Arabic, the word \u0642\u064f\u0631\u0652\u0622\u0646 (Qur'an) is derived from the verb \u0642\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0623\u064e (qara'a), which means \"to read\" or \"to recite.\" So, literally, it would relate to something being recited or read. That makes sense because the Qur'an is a text that is meant to be recited aloud, not just read silently. Recitation is a big part of Islamic practice, especially during prayers and other religious observances.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nA. The Holy Book \u2013 Well, yes, the Qur'an is considered a holy book in Islam, but that doesn't directly translate to its literal meaning. \"Holy Book\" is more of a descriptive term rather than a literal translation of \"Qur'an.\"\n\nB. The Narrative \u2013 Hmm, the Qur'an does contain stories and narratives, including accounts of prophets and historical events, but again, that's more about its content rather than the literal meaning of the term.\n\nC. The Recitation \u2013 This seems to align with what I know about the origin of the word \"Qur'an.\" As I mentioned earlier, it's related to the act of reciting or reading aloud, which is a fundamental aspect of how the Qur'an is engaged with in Islamic practice.\n\nD. The Pillars \u2013 This doesn't seem right. The Five Pillars of Islam are the basic acts that define the religious practice of Muslims, such as Shahadah (faith), Salat (prayer), Zakat (charity), Sawm (fasting), and Hajj (pilgrimage). The Qur'an is separate from these, although it does prescribe and explain these practices.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option C. The Recitation seems to be the correct literal translation of the term \"Qur'an.\" It's important to note that while the Qur'an is indeed a holy book, its literal meaning is more specifically related to the act of recitation, which is a key element of its use in Islamic worship and daily life.\n\nJust to double-check, I can recall that in Arabic, the root of the word \"Qur'an\" is \u0642 \u0631 \u0623 (q-r-\u02bf), which corresponds to the verb \u0642\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0623\u064e (qara'a), meaning \"to read\" or \"to recite.\" Therefore, the term \"Qur'an\" literally means \"the recitation,\" referring to the words that are recited in the act of worship and learning.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. Choosing C. The Recitation as the literal meaning of \"Qur'an\" makes the most sense, given the etymology and the cultural context in which the Qur'an is used and revered in Islam.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
