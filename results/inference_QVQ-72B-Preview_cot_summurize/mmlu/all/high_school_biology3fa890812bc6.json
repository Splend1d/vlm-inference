                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem about chicken feather colors. So, we have a rooster and a hen, both with gray feathers, and they produce chicks that end up having gray, black, or white feathers in the ratio of 17 gray, 7 black, and 8 white. The question is asking for the simplest explanation of how these colors are inherited.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what's being asked here. It seems like we're dealing with chicken feather color inheritance, and there are options provided that talk about different genetic concepts like epistasis, incomplete dominance, and codominance. So, I need to recall what these terms mean and see which one fits the observed phenotype ratios.\n\nLet me start by defining these terms to make sure I understand them correctly:\n\n- **Epistasis:** This is when one gene masks the expression of another gene. So, if one trait is epistatic over another, it means that the presence of a certain allele in the first gene affects how the second gene's allele is expressed.\n\n- **Incomplete dominance:** This is when neither allele is dominant over the other, and the heterozygote shows an intermediate phenotype.\n\n- **Codominance:** This is similar to incomplete dominance but differs in that both alleles are fully expressed simultaneously, leading to a phenotype that is a combination of both.\n\nGiven that both parents are gray, but their offspring show three different phenotypes: gray, black, and white, it suggests that gray is not completely dominant or recessive, or perhaps there's another mechanism at play.\n\nLet me consider the options one by one.\n\n**Option A: The trait for gray is epistatic over the trait for black.**\n\nIf gray is epistatic over black, that means the presence of certain alleles for gray masks the expression of black. But in this case, both parents are gray, and they're producing black chicks. This suggests that the black trait isn't being masked in the offspring, even if gray is epistatic over black. Wait, that doesn't seem to make sense. If gray is epistatic over black, then any chick that inherits alleles that would otherwise express black would still show gray because of the epistatic effect. But in this case, we're seeing black chicks, which means that the epistatic effect isn't masking the black phenotype in all cases.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently. Perhaps there are multiple genes involved. Let's consider that.\n\n**Option B: The trait for gray is epistatic over the trait for white.**\n\nSimilar to option A, if gray is epistatic over white, then the presence of certain gray alleles would mask the expression of white. Again, both parents are gray, and they're producing white chicks, which suggests that the epistatic effect isn't preventing the expression of white entirely.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe epistasis isn't the right model here, and incomplete dominance or codominance would be more appropriate.\n\n**Option C: The traits for black and white color demonstrate incomplete dominance.**\n\nIncomplete dominance means that the heterozygote shows an intermediate phenotype. In this context, if black and white are incompletely dominant, then the heterozygote should have an intermediate color, which is gray. That makes sense. So, if black and white are the two extreme phenotypes, and gray is the intermediate, then the parents are both heterozygotes, and their offspring should show a 1:2:1 ratio of black:gray:white.\n\nLet's check the observed numbers: 7 black, 17 gray, and 8 white. That's roughly 7:17:8, which isn't exactly 1:2:1 but could be close, considering small sample sizes.\n\n**Option D: The traits for black and white color demonstrate codominance.**\n\nCodominance means that both alleles are fully expressed in the heterozygote. In terms of color, this might mean that the chick would show a mixture of black and white feathers, perhaps resulting in a patterned appearance rather than a uniform gray. But in this case, the parents are gray, and the offspring are gray, black, or white, suggesting that the gray isn't a mixture but a uniform color.\n\nWait, maybe the gray is a result of blending, which could be codominance. But the description says \"gray feathers,\" which sounds uniform, not patterned. So, perhaps incomplete dominance is a better fit here.\n\nLet me think about this again. If black and white are incompletely dominant, then:\n\n- Homozygous dominant: black\n\n- Heterozygous: gray\n\n- Homozygous recessive: white\n\nBoth parents are gray, so heterozygous. Their gametes would each carry one allele for black and one for white. The possible combinations for offspring would be:\n\n- Black/black: black\n\n- Black/white: gray\n\n- White/white: white\n\nSo, the expected ratio is 1:2:1 for black:gray:white.\n\nLooking back at the observed numbers: 7 black, 17 gray, and 8 white. This is close to the expected 1:2:1 ratio, considering that small sample sizes can lead to variations.\n\nAlternatively, if epistasis is involved, the ratios might be different. For example, if there's a separate gene affecting the expression of color, but that seems more complicated.\n\nGiven that option C suggests incomplete dominance between black and white, leading to gray being the heterozygote, and the observed ratios match this model reasonably well, I think option C is the simplest explanation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if codominance could also explain the observed phenotypes.\n\nIn codominance, the heterozygote expresses both alleles simultaneously. So, if black and white are codominant, the heterozygote should have both colors expressed, perhaps in a speckled pattern or something similar, not a uniform gray. But in this problem, the gray is described as a uniform color, not a patterned one. Therefore, codominance doesn't seem to fit the description as well as incomplete dominance does.\n\nAdditionally, if codominance were at play, we might expect to see chicks with mixed black and white feathers, but the problem states that the parents are gray, which suggests a uniform color. Unless gray is a separate allele, but that seems more complicated.\n\nTherefore, the simplest explanation is that black and white color traits demonstrate incomplete dominance, with gray being the intermediate phenotype expressed in heterozygous individuals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
