                    "text": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, the question is about the probability of an accident on Highway 48 today, given some information about the weather and how that affects the accident rates. Let me try to rephrase it to make sure I understand.\n\nWe have two possible scenarios for today's weather: it's either dry or wet. If it's dry, there's a 0.2% chance of an accident on Highway 48. If it's wet, there's a 1.0% chance of an accident. Additionally, the weather station says there's a 20% chance that the weather will be wet today. We need to find the overall probability of an accident on Highway 48 today.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic probability rules. Since there are only two possible weather conditions, dry or wet, and no other options are mentioned, the probability of the weather being dry is 1 minus the probability of it being wet. So, if there's a 20% chance of it being wet, then there's an 80% chance of it being dry.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nP(dry) = 80% = 0.8\n\nP(wet) = 20% = 0.2\n\nNow, given the weather, we have conditional probabilities for accidents:\n\nP(accident | dry) = 0.2%\n\nP(accident | wet) = 1.0%\n\nI need to find the overall probability of an accident today, regardless of the weather. This sounds like a case where I need to use the law of total probability. That is, P(accident) = P(accident | dry) * P(dry) + P(accident | wet) * P(wet).\n\nLet me plug in the values:\n\nP(accident) = (0.2% * 0.8) + (1.0% * 0.2)\n\nFirst, convert the percentages to decimals for easier calculation:\n\n0.2% = 0.002\n\n1.0% = 0.01\n\nSo,\n\nP(accident) = (0.002 * 0.8) + (0.01 * 0.2)\n\nNow, calculate each term:\n\n0.002 * 0.8 = 0.0016\n\n0.01 * 0.2 = 0.002\n\nAdd them together:\n\n0.0016 + 0.002 = 0.0036\n\nSo, the probability of an accident on Highway 48 today is 0.0036, which is 0.36%.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 0.0004\n\nB. 0.0016\n\nC. 0.002\n\nD. 0.0036\n\nIt seems like the answer should be D. 0.0036.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirm the probabilities:\n\nP(dry) = 80% = 0.8\n\nP(wet) = 20% = 0.2\n\nP(accident | dry) = 0.2% = 0.002\n\nP(accident | wet) = 1.0% = 0.01\n\nUsing the law of total probability:\n\nP(accident) = P(accident | dry) * P(dry) + P(accident | wet) * P(wet)\n\n= 0.002 * 0.8 + 0.01 * 0.2\n\n= 0.0016 + 0.002\n\n= 0.0036\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might misinterpret the percentages, so let's consider if there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose I think in terms of a tree diagram. First branch: weather is dry or wet. Then, from each weather condition, branches to accident or no accident.\n\nGiven the probabilities:\n\n- If dry (80%), 0.2% chance of accident.\n\n- If wet (20%), 1.0% chance of accident.\n\nSo, the probability of an accident is indeed the sum of the probabilities of the two branches leading to an accident.\n\nThat is, P(accident) = P(dry) * P(accident | dry) + P(wet) * P(accident | wet)\n\nWhich is what I calculated earlier: 0.8 * 0.002 + 0.2 * 0.01 = 0.0036\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 0.0036\n\nI think that's it. No further confusion here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 0.0036} \\]"
