                    "text": "So I've got this question here about positive statements in economics. Positive statements are basically facts or assertions about the way the world is, without making judgments about what ought to be. They're empirical and can be tested against reality. On the other hand, normative statements are about what should be, involving value judgments and opinions.\n\nSo, looking at the options:\n\nA. An economy that produces more butter than guns is better off than an economy that produces more guns than butter.\n\nThis seems like a normative statement because it's making a judgment about what's better. The terms \"better off\" imply a value judgment about what's preferable, which isn't a factual claim that can be tested empirically.\n\nB. Nations should concentrate their resources on producing wholesome consumer goods as opposed to the weapons of war.\n\nThis is clearly normative. The use of \"should\" indicates a prescription about what nations ought to do, reflecting a value judgment about the desirability of certain choices.\n\nC. The production possibilities frontier is concave to the origin because of the law of increasing costs.\n\nThis sounds like a positive statement. It's describing a characteristic of the production possibilities frontier (PPF) and explaining it based on the law of increasing costs. This is a theoretical construct in economics that can be illustrated graphically and explained through economic principles, without involving value judgments.\n\nD. Nations ought to devote at least some of their resources to national defense.\n\nAgain, this is normative. The use of \"ought to\" suggests a prescription about what nations should do, implying a value judgment about the importance of national defense.\n\nSo, based on this, the only positive statement is C. It's describing a factual relationship in economics, specifically about the shape of the production possibilities frontier and the reason behind it, without making any judgments about what should be done.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In economics, the production possibilities frontier is indeed concave to the origin due to the law of increasing costs. This is because as a society produces more of one good and less of another, the opportunity cost increases, leading to a concave shape. This is a fundamental economic concept, and stating it is a positive statement because it's describing how things are, not how they should be.\n\nOption A, even though it's comparing two scenarios, is still making a value judgment about which scenario is better. It's not just describing the trade-offs; it's judging one to be preferable to the other.\n\nOption B is straightforwardly normative because it's telling nations what they should do\u2014concentrate on consumer goods rather than weapons.\n\nOption D is also normative because it's prescribing that nations should allocate some resources to defense.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. It's a positive statement because it's describing an economic phenomenon without involving value judgments.\n\nI think that's solid. If I were to teach this, I'd explain that positive statements are about facts, while normative statements are about values and prescriptions. In this case, only option C fits the bill as a positive statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
