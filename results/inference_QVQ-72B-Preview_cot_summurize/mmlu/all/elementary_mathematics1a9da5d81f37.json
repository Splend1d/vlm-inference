Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that adding negative numbers is like subtracting positive numbers. So, -16 means I'm moving 16 units to the left on the number line. Then, adding 13 means I move 13 units to the right, and adding -33 means another move of 33 units to the left. Maybe visualizing it like that will help me keep track.\n\nLet me try step by step.\n\nStarting at zero:\n\n1. Add -16: 0 - 16 = -16\n\n2. Then add 13: -16 + 13\n\nTo calculate -16 + 13, I can think of it as subtracting 13 from -16. Since 16 - 13 is 3, but since the larger number is negative, the result should be negative. So, -16 + 13 = -3.\n\n3. Finally, add -33: -3 - 33\n\nAgain, subtracting 33 from -3: -3 - 33 = -36.\n\nSo, the final result is -36.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can group the numbers differently to confirm.\n\nLet's try adding all the numbers together directly:\n\n-16 + 13 + (-33) = -16 + 13 - 33\n\nFirst, -16 + 13 is -3, as I said before.\n\nThen, -3 - 33 is indeed -36.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can rearrange the numbers to make it easier:\n\n-16 + 13 + (-33) = 13 - 16 + (-33)\n\nFirst, 13 - 16 is -3, then -3 + (-33) is -36.\n\nSame result. It looks consistent.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can use the commutative property and add them in a different order:\n\n-16 + 13 + (-33) = -16 + (-33) + 13\n\nFirst, -16 - 33 is -49, then -49 + 13 is -36.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think it's clear that the expression equals -36.\n\nBut wait, let's consider if there's any trick here. Is there a possibility of misinterpreting the operations?\n\nLooking back at the expression: -16 + 13 + (-33)\n\nIt's straightforward: just adding the numbers as they are, keeping in mind the signs.\n\nNo exponents or parentheses to complicate things, besides the negative inside the last term.\n\nI should also consider if there are any units or anything, but since it's just an expression without context, I assume it's just about the numerical value.\n\nSo, based on all my calculations and checks, the correct answer should be -36.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 4\n\nB. 62\n\nC. 36\n\nD. -36\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. -36.\n\nI think that's it. No further confusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-36} \\]"
