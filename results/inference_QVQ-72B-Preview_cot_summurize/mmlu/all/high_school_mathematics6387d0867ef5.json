                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find out how many of the 401 integers from -200 to 200 are congruent to 5 modulo 13. The options are 30, 31, 60, and 45. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a number to be congruent to 5 modulo 13. It means that when you divide the number by 13, the remainder is 5. So, numbers in this form are of the type 13k + 5, where k is an integer.\n\nBut wait, we're dealing with integers from -200 to 200, inclusive. That's a total of 401 integers. I need to find how many of these satisfy the condition of being congruent to 5 mod 13.\n\nLet me start by finding the smallest and largest numbers in this range that fit the form 13k + 5.\n\nFirst, let's find the smallest number greater than or equal to -200 that is congruent to 5 mod 13.\n\nSo, I need to solve for k in 13k + 5 >= -200.\n\nLet's solve for k:\n\n13k + 5 >= -200\n\n13k >= -205\n\nk >= -205 / 13\n\nCalculating -205 divided by 13:\n\n13 * 15 = 195, so 13*16 = 208, which is too big. 13*(-16) = -208, which is less than -205. Let's check k = -16:\n\n13*(-16) + 5 = -208 + 5 = -203.\n\nIs -203 >= -200? No, -203 is less than -200.\n\nSo, try k = -15:\n\n13*(-15) + 5 = -195 + 5 = -190.\n\n-190 is still less than -200.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If k = -15, then 13*(-15) + 5 = -195 + 5 = -190, which is greater than -200. Wait, I think I messed up the inequality direction.\n\nWait, let's recast this.\n\nWe have 13k + 5 >= -200.\n\nSo, 13k >= -205\n\nk >= -205 / 13\n\n-205 / 13 is approximately -15.769.\n\nSince k must be an integer, the smallest integer k that satisfies this is k = -15.\n\nLet's check:\n\n13*(-15) + 5 = -195 + 5 = -190.\n\nIs -190 within -200 to 200? Yes.\n\nNow, check k = -16:\n\n13*(-16) + 5 = -208 + 5 = -203.\n\n-203 is less than -200, so it's not included.\n\nTherefore, the smallest k is -15.\n\nNow, let's find the largest k such that 13k + 5 <= 200.\n\nSo, 13k + 5 <= 200\n\n13k <= 195\n\nk <= 195 / 13\n\nk <= 15\n\nSo, the largest k is 15.\n\nTherefore, k ranges from -15 to 15, inclusive.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of integers from -15 to 15, inclusive.\n\nThat's 15 - (-15) + 1 = 31.\n\nWait, but let's double-check that.\n\nFrom k = -15 to k = 15, inclusive, how many integers are there?\n\nFrom -15 to 15, inclusive, the total number is 15 - (-15) + 1 = 31.\n\nSo, the answer should be 31.\n\nBut let's verify with some examples.\n\nLet's list them:\n\nk = -15: -190\n\nk = -14: -177\n\nk = -13: -164\n\nk = -12: -151\n\nk = -11: -138\n\nk = -10: -125\n\nk = -9: -112\n\nk = -8: -99\n\nk = -7: -86\n\nk = -6: -73\n\nk = -5: -60\n\nk = -4: -47\n\nk = -3: -34\n\nk = -2: -21\n\nk = -1: -8\n\nk = 0: 5\n\nk = 1: 18\n\nk = 2: 31\n\nk = 3: 44\n\nk = 4: 57\n\nk = 5: 70\n\nk = 6: 83\n\nk = 7: 96\n\nk = 8: 109\n\nk = 9: 122\n\nk = 10: 135\n\nk = 11: 148\n\nk = 12: 161\n\nk = 13: 174\n\nk = 14: 187\n\nk = 15: 200\n\nThat's a total of 31 numbers.\n\nSo, the answer should be 31.\n\nWait, but option C is 60. Why would someone think it's 60?\n\nMaybe they considered both positive and negative sides separately or miscalculated the range.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they thought to count numbers congruent to 5 mod 13 and 5 mod -13, but that's unnecessary since 13 is the modulus, regardless of sign.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they tried to find the number of periods of 13 in the range from -200 to 200.\n\nThe total range is from -200 to 200, which is 401 numbers.\n\nThe step is 13, so the number of steps is floor(401/13) = 30 with some remainder.\n\nBut that doesn't account for the starting point.\n\nWait, perhaps they did 401 / 13 = 30 with a remainder, but that doesn't directly apply here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they considered the number of complete cycles of 13 in the range.\n\nBut in this case, since we're dealing with a specific residue (5), and we've already found 31 numbers, I think 31 is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. 31.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{31} \\]"
