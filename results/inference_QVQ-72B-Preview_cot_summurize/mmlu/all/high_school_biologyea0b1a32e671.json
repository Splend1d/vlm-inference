                    "text": "So I have this genetics problem here. It says that in a population of guinea pigs, 4 percent are black, which is the recessive trait, and 96 percent are brown. I need to find the frequency of the heterozygous condition. The options are A. 16 percent, B. 32 percent, C. 40 percent, and D. 48 percent.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall some basic genetics concepts. I know that in genetics, traits can be dominant or recessive. In this case, brown is dominant over black, which is recessive. The frequencies given are for the phenotypes, which are the expressed traits.\n\nSo, the population has 96% brown and 4% black guinea pigs. Assuming this population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, I can use the Hardy-Weinberg principle to find the allele frequencies and then determine the frequency of heterozygous individuals.\n\nThe Hardy-Weinberg equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele, q is the frequency of the recessive allele, p\u00b2 is the frequency of homozygous dominant individuals, 2pq is the frequency of heterozygous individuals, and q\u00b2 is the frequency of homozygous recessive individuals.\n\nIn this scenario, the recessive trait is black, which is 4%, so that should be q\u00b2 = 0.04.\n\nTo find q, I can take the square root of q\u00b2: q = sqrt(0.04) = 0.2 or 20%.\n\nThen, p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 or 80%.\n\nNow, the frequency of heterozygous individuals is 2pq, which is 2 * 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.32, or 32%.\n\nWait a minute, that's option B. But let me double-check if there's any other way to approach this or if I missed something.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the brown phenotype. Since brown is dominant, it includes both homozygous dominant (p\u00b2) and heterozygous (2pq) individuals. So, p\u00b2 + 2pq = 96%, which is the frequency of brown guinea pigs.\n\nI already have p = 0.8 and q = 0.2, so p\u00b2 = (0.8)^2 = 0.64 or 64%. Then, 2pq = 0.32 or 32%.\n\nAdding them up: 64% + 32% = 96%, which matches the given frequency of brown guinea pigs. So, this seems consistent.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that the recessive phenotype frequency is q\u00b2 = 4%, and since q = sqrt(4%) = 20%, then p = 80%, and 2pq = 2 * 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.32 or 32%.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, it looks like the answer should be 32%, which is option B.\n\nBut let's see if there's any trick here or if I need to consider something else.\n\nIs the population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium? The problem doesn't specify, but often these problems assume that it is, unless stated otherwise.\n\nAlso, the options are given in percentages, so I need to make sure I'm converting my calculations accordingly.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe using the Hardy-Weinberg formula in terms of allele frequencies.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- p = frequency of the dominant allele (brown)\n\n- q = frequency of the recessive allele (black)\n\nGiven that black is recessive and its frequency is 4%, that should be q\u00b2 = 0.04.\n\nSo, q = sqrt(0.04) = 0.2\n\nThen, p = 1 - q = 0.8\n\nFrequency of heterozygous individuals = 2pq = 2 * 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.32 or 32%.\n\nYes, this seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the brown phenotype includes both homozygous dominant and heterozygous individuals, which together make up 96% of the population.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + 2pq = 96%\n\nPlugging in p = 0.8, 2pq = 0.32, and p\u00b2 = 0.64.\n\nAdding them up: 0.64 + 0.32 = 0.96, which is 96%, matching the given percentage.\n\nTherefore, the frequency of heterozygous individuals is indeed 0.32 or 32%.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently. So, the answer should be B. 32 percent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
