                    "text": "So I have this question about simple linear regression between stock and market returns. I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let's see, in simple linear regression, we're trying to model the relationship between two variables, right? Here, it's stock returns and market returns. The equation is usually something like:\n\nStock return = \u03b1 + \u03b2 * Market return + \u03b5\n\nWhere \u03b1 is the intercept, \u03b2 is the slope, and \u03b5 is the error term.\n\nOption A says that it fits the errors to obtain a more precise estimate of the stock's beta. Hmm, in regression, the errors are the residuals, which are the differences between the observed and predicted values. The goal of ordinary least squares regression is to minimize the sum of these squared errors to find the best estimates of \u03b1 and \u03b2. So, in a way, yes, by minimizing the errors, we get better estimates of beta. But the way it's phrased seems a bit off. Maybe it's not the best choice.\n\nOption B says it minimizes the stock's alpha, which is its idiosyncratic component. Alpha represents the excess return of the stock compared to what the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) predicts. In regression, minimizing the error terms would indirectly affect alpha, but alpha isn't the primary focus. The primary goal is to estimate alpha and beta, not to minimize alpha. So, this seems confusing.\n\nOption C says it estimates the alpha of stock returns and their dependence on market returns. That sounds reasonable. Regression does estimate alpha and beta, which represent the intercept and the sensitivity of the stock's return to the market return, respectively. So, this seems like a good candidate.\n\nOption D says it models market returns as a function of stock returns and its beta. Wait a minute, in standard regression, we usually model stock returns as a function of market returns, not the other way around. If we switch the dependent and independent variables, that changes things. In finance, the CAPM assumes that stock returns depend on market returns, not vice versa. So, modeling market returns based on stock returns seems counterintuitive.\n\nLet me think again. The question is about simple linear regression between stock and market returns. In finance, typically, we use regression to estimate the beta of a stock, which measures its volatility relative to the market. The regression equation is stock return = \u03b1 + \u03b2 * market return + \u03b5.\n\nGiven that, option A mentions fitting errors to get a better beta estimate. While minimizing errors does lead to better estimates, the phrasing seems unclear.\n\nOption B talks about minimizing alpha, which is the idiosyncratic component. Alpha is the residual return not explained by the market, so minimizing it might imply a better fit of the model, but that's not the primary objective.\n\nOption C says it estimates alpha and the dependence on market returns. That sounds accurate because that's exactly what regression does\u2014it gives you estimates of alpha and beta, which quantify the relationship between stock and market returns.\n\nOption D suggests modeling market returns as a function of stock returns and its beta. This seems backwards from the standard approach, where stock returns are modeled as a function of market returns.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is option C: it estimates the alpha of stock returns and their dependence on market returns.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
