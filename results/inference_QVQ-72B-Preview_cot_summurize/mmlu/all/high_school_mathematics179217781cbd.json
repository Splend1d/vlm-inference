                    "text": "So I have this problem here: I need to find the sum of the squares from 21\u00b2 to 40\u00b2. The formula given is for the sum of squares from 1\u00b2 to n\u00b2, which is n(n+1)(2n+1)/6. I need to find a way to use this formula to calculate the sum from 21\u00b2 to 40\u00b2.\n\nFirst, I should think about how to adjust the formula to start from 21 instead of 1. Maybe I can find the sum from 1 to 40 and subtract the sum from 1 to 20. That way, I'll be left with the sum from 21 to 40.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nSum from 21 to 40 = Sum from 1 to 40 - Sum from 1 to 20\n\nI know the formula for the sum of squares from 1 to n, so I can plug that in.\n\nSum from 21 to 40 = [40(40+1)(2*40+1)]/6 - [20(20+1)(2*20+1)]/6\n\nNow, I need to calculate these two parts separately.\n\nFirst, calculate [40(41)(81)]/6.\n\nLet me compute 40*41 first:\n\n40*40 = 1600\n\n40*1 = 40\n\nSo, 40*41 = 1640\n\nNow, 1640 * 81.\n\nThis seems a bit tricky, but maybe I can break it down.\n\n80*1640 = 131,200\n\n1*1640 = 1,640\n\nSo, 81*1640 = 131,200 + 1,640 = 132,840\n\nNow, divide that by 6.\n\n132,840 \u00f7 6 = ?\n\nWell, 132,840 \u00f7 6 = 22,140\n\nOkay, so that's the sum from 1 to 40.\n\nNow, calculate [20(21)(41)]/6 for the sum from 1 to 20.\n\nFirst, 20*21 = 420\n\nThen, 420*41.\n\nAgain, breaking it down:\n\n400*41 = 16,400\n\n20*41 = 820\n\nSo, 16,400 + 820 = 17,220\n\nNow, divide by 6:\n\n17,220 \u00f7 6 = 2,870\n\nTherefore, the sum from 21 to 40 is 22,140 - 2,870 = ?\n\nLet me subtract:\n\n22,140\n\n-  2,870\n\n= 19,270\n\nSo, the sum from 21\u00b2 to 40\u00b2 is 19,270.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 41\n\nB. 22,140\n\nC. 19,270\n\nD. 2,870\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 19,270.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the sum of squares directly for the range from 21 to 40, but I'm not sure if there's a standard formula for that. The standard formula is for 1 to n.\n\nWait, actually, there is a formula for the sum of squares from m to n, which is the sum from 1 to n minus the sum from 1 to (m-1). Which is exactly what I did earlier.\n\nSo, I think that's the right approach.\n\nAnother way could be to list out the squares from 21\u00b2 to 40\u00b2 and sum them up, but that would be time-consuming and prone to error, especially since there are 20 terms.\n\nGiven that, I think the method I used is efficient and correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 19,270.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{19270} \\]"
