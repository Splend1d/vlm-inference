                    "text": "Let's tackle this genetics problem. So, it's about an X-linked recessive disorder, and we're told that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The incidence in males is 1 in 100, and we need to find the expected incidence of affected homozygous females. The options are 1 in 1000, 1 in 4000, 1 in 10,000, or 1 in 40,000.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basics about X-linked recessive disorders. In such disorders, males are hemizygous because they have only one X chromosome. That means if a male has the recessive allele on his X chromosome, he will express the disorder because there's no corresponding gene on the Y chromosome to mask it.\n\nFor females to be affected, they need to have two copies of the recessive allele, since they have two X chromosomes. So, they need to be homozygous recessive.\n\nThe Hardy-Weinberg principle applies to populations that are not evolving and allows us to calculate genotype frequencies based on allele frequencies.\n\nLet's denote the frequency of the recessive allele as q. Since it's X-linked, males have one X chromosome, and females have two.\n\nGiven that the incidence in males is 1 in 100, that means the frequency of the recessive allele in the population is q = 1/100 = 0.01.\n\nWait, but in X-linked recessive inheritance, the frequency of the recessive allele in males is q, because males only have one X chromosome.\n\nSo, q = 1/100 = 0.01.\n\nNow, for females to be affected, they need to be homozygous recessive, which means they have two copies of the recessive allele. So, their genotype would be q\u00b2.\n\nIn a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium population, the frequency of homozygous recessive females would be q\u00b2.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 = (0.01)\u00b2 = 0.0001.\n\nThat means 0.01% of females would be affected.\n\nBut the question is asking for the incidence in terms of 1 in what number.\n\nSo, if q\u00b2 = 0.0001, that means 1 in 10,000 females are affected.\n\nWait, but let's double-check that.\n\nThe frequency of the recessive allele q = 0.01.\n\nThen, the frequency of homozygous recessive females should indeed be q\u00b2 = (0.01)\u00b2 = 0.0001.\n\nSo, 0.01% or 1 in 10,000.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing something about X-linked inheritance.\n\nIn X-linked recessive disorders, males only need one X chromosome with the recessive allele to be affected, whereas females need two.\n\nSo, the frequency of affected males should be equal to q, and affected females should be q\u00b2.\n\nGiven that, and q = 1/100, then q\u00b2 = 1/10,000.\n\nSo, the expected incidence of affected homozygous females would be 1 in 10,000.\n\nWait, but let's consider the actual genotype frequencies in the population.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- p = frequency of the dominant allele\n\n- q = frequency of the recessive allele\n\nIn males (hemizygous):\n\n- Frequency of affected males = q = 0.01\n\nIn females:\n\n- Frequency of homozygous dominant (normal) = (p)^2\n\n- Frequency of heterozygous carriers = 2pq\n\n- Frequency of homozygous recessive (affected) = (q)^2\n\nGiven that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, these frequencies should hold.\n\nTherefore, the incidence of affected homozygous females should indeed be q\u00b2 = (0.01)^2 = 0.0001, or 1 in 10,000.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the options again:\n\nA. 1 in 1000\n\nB. 1 in 4000\n\nC. 1 in 10,000\n\nD. 1 in 40,000\n\nGiven that q = 0.01, and q\u00b2 = 0.0001, which is 1 in 10,000, option C seems correct.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a different way to approach this, considering the sex-linked nature more carefully.\n\nLet\u2019s recall that in X-linked recessive inheritance, the frequency of affected males is q, and the frequency of affected females is q\u00b2, as I previously thought.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it, considering the different numbers of X chromosomes in males and females.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for X-linked recessive disorders in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the population frequencies more carefully.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Males: X^A Y (normal) and X^a Y (affected)\n\n- Females: X^A X^A (normal), X^A X^a (carrier), X^a X^a (affected)\n\nGiven that males are hemizygous, the frequency of affected males is q.\n\nFor females, frequency of affected is q\u00b2.\n\nGiven that, and q = 1/100, q\u00b2 should indeed be 1/10,000.\n\nBut let's verify this with actual allele frequencies.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the population has equal numbers of males and females.\n\nLet\u2019s say there are M males and F females.\n\nSince it's X-linked, the total number of X chromosomes is:\n\n- In males: M (each male has one X)\n\n- In females: 2F (each female has two X)\n\nTotal X chromosomes in the population: M + 2F\n\nAssuming M = F for simplicity, total X chromosomes = M + 2M = 3M\n\nThen, the frequency of the recessive allele q = (number of recessive alleles)/(total X chromosomes) = (number of recessive alleles)/(3M)\n\nGiven that the incidence in males is 1 in 100, which are all males with X^a Y, so the number of recessive alleles in males is M/100.\n\nIn females, the number of recessive alleles is 2*(F proportion with X^a X^a) + (F proportion with X^a X^A)\n\nBut in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the proportions are:\n\n- Males: q = frequency of X^a = 1/100 = 0.01\n\n- Females: frequency of X^a X^a = q\u00b2 = (0.01)^2 = 0.0001\n\nSo, the frequency of affected females is 0.01%, or 1 in 10,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 1 in 10,000.\n\nBut let's see if there's any other factor to consider.\n\nPerhaps the ratio of males to females in the population could affect the frequency.\n\nBut assuming a 1:1 sex ratio, the calculation holds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a correction factor due to the different number of X chromosomes in males and females.\n\nBut in standard Hardy-Weinberg calculations for X-linked traits, q is determined from the male frequency directly, and q\u00b2 gives the female homozygous recessive frequency.\n\nTherefore, the expected incidence of affected homozygous females is 1 in 10,000.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 1 in 10,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
