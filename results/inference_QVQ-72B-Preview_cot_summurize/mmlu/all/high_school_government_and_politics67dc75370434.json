                    "text": "So I have this question here about \"ticket splitting.\" I need to figure out which option best describes this practice. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, what does \"ticket splitting\" mean? I think it has something to do with voting, maybe where a voter doesn't just vote straight down one party line but mixes and matches candidates from different parties. Like, maybe voting for one party's presidential candidate but another party's candidates for Congress or something like that.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. A presidential nominee selects a running mate who can appeal to voter groups whose support of the nominee is weak.\n\nThis seems like it's about how a presidential candidate chooses their vice-presidential pick to balance the ticket and appeal to different demographics or regions. That sounds more like ticket balancing rather than splitting. So, probably not the right choice.\n\nB. A voter chooses the presidential nominee of one major party, but chooses congressional nominees of the other major party.\n\nThis seems to align with my initial thought about ticket splitting. It's when a voter doesn't vote strictly along party lines but instead picks candidates from different parties for different offices. So, in this case, voting for one party's president and another party's Congress members. That sounds like splitting your choices across different tickets or parties.\n\nC. A mayor orders the local police force to hand out fewer parking violations in the weeks leading up to the general election.\n\nThis option seems completely unrelated to ticket splitting. It's about a mayor influencing police behavior before an election, which might be related to electioneering or some other electoral strategy, but it doesn't involve splitting votes between different parties or tickets. So, probably not the answer.\n\nD. A delegate to a national party convention supports the front-runner but remains uncommitted on the party platform.\n\nThis seems to be about a delegate's position within a party convention. Supporting a front-runner for the nomination but not committing to the party's platform suggests some disagreement or strategic positioning within the party. But again, this doesn't directly relate to splitting votes between different parties or tickets. It's more about internal party dynamics.\n\nSo, based on the definitions and the options provided, option B seems to be the best description of ticket splitting. It directly refers to a voter choosing candidates from different major parties for different offices, which aligns with the concept of splitting one's vote across multiple tickets.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check. Ticket splitting is indeed when voters cast their ballots for candidates from multiple parties across different races or offices. So, in this case, choosing a presidential nominee from one party and congressional nominees from another party is a classic example of ticket splitting.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. A voter chooses the presidential nominee of one major party, but chooses congressional nominees of the other major party.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
