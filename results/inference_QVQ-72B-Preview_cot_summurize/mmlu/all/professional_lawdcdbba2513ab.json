                    "text": "So Mort bought a property that has a small rental home on it, and there's a concrete driveway that runs between his house and Tony's house next door. The thing is, this driveway is entirely on Mort's side of the property line, but Tony has been using it for the past 25 years. During those 25 years, there have been three different owners of Mort's house before he bought it. Now, when Mort applied to refinance his loan, his appraiser found an old survey that shows the accurate property boundaries, and this has caused some upset. As a result, Mort filed a suit against Tony for trespass. We need to figure out what the likely result of this lawsuit will be.\n\nFirst, let's understand what trespass is. Trespass is the unauthorized entry onto someone else's property. In this case, Mort is claiming that Tony has been using his driveway without permission, which is trespassing. However, there are several factors that could affect this claim.\n\nOne important concept here is adverse possession. Adverse possession is a legal doctrine where someone who doesn't own a property can acquire legal ownership by continuously and openly using the property for a certain period, defined by state law. In this scenario, Tony has been using the driveway for 25 years, which is a significant period. If the state where they live has a statutory period for adverse possession that is less than or equal to 25 years, Tony might have a claim to the driveway through adverse possession.\n\nBut adverse possession typically requires that the use be hostile, actual, open and notorious, continuous, and exclusive. \"Hostile\" means that the use is without the permission of the true owner. However, in some jurisdictions, the hostility requirement can be met if the user acts as if they own the property, even if they believe in good faith that they have a right to use it.\n\nOption A says that Mort will prevail in an action for trespass because Tony's use wasn't \"hostile.\" But if Tony has been using the driveway for 25 years without permission, it might be considered hostile use. However, if Tony had permission from previous owners to use the driveway, then it wouldn't be hostile. But the problem states that the driveway is entirely on Mort's property, and Tony has been using it for 25 years, but doesn't specify whether he had permission from previous owners. It's possible that previous owners allowed Tony to use the driveway, which would make the use not hostile. If that's the case, then Mort might not prevail on the trespass claim based on hostility.\n\nOption B says that Mort will prevail because Tony's use wasn't \"open and notorious.\" Open and notorious means that the use is obvious to anyone who looks, and it's being done without attempting to hide it. In this case, Tony has been using the driveway for 25 years, which is a long time, and it's between two houses, so it's likely that the use was open and obvious to anyone, including Mort and previous owners. Therefore, it's unlikely that Mort would prevail on the grounds that the use wasn't open and notorious.\n\nOption C says that Tony will prevail if he used the driveway for the statutory period. This refers to the period required by state law for adverse possession. If the statutory period is less than or equal to 25 years, and Tony has been using the driveway continuously and openly during that time, then Tony might have a valid adverse possession claim to the driveway. However, adverse possession typically results in ownership of the property, not just an easement. An easement is a right to use someone else's property for a specific purpose, like driving over a driveway, without owning it.\n\nOption D says that Tony will prevail because the easement was due to necessity. Easement by necessity arises when a property is landlocked and has no access to a public road, making an easement necessary for reasonable use of the property. However, in this scenario, it's not specified that Tony's property is landlocked or that he has no other means of access. If Tony has other ways to access his property, such as his own driveway or a different easement, then an easement by necessity wouldn't apply.\n\nGiven the information provided, it seems that Tony has been using the driveway for 25 years, and during that time, there have been multiple owners of Mort's property. It's possible that previous owners granted Tony permission to use the driveway, which would make the use not hostile, meaning that adverse possession might not apply, or at least the hostility requirement might not be met.\n\nHowever, even if Tony doesn't have adverse possession, he might have an easement by prescription. An easement by prescription is similar to adverse possession but typically requires use that is open, notorious, continuous, and without permission for a specified period. The key difference is that an easement by prescription results in a right to use the property, not ownership of it.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, the period required for an easement by prescription is shorter than that for adverse possession. For example, in some states, adverse possession requires 20 years of use, while an easement by prescription requires only 10 years. Therefore, even if the statutory period for adverse possession hasn't been met, an easement by prescription might still be recognized.\n\nGiven that Tony has been using the driveway for 25 years, which is more than sufficient for most statutory periods for easements by prescription, it's likely that Tony has an easement by prescription to continue using the driveway.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Mort will prevail in an action for trespass, because Tony's use wasn't \"hostile.\" \u2013 This might not be the case if Tony was using the driveway without permission.\n\nB. Mort will prevail because Tony's use wasn't \"open and notorious.\" \u2013 This seems unlikely, as the use has been ongoing for 25 years.\n\nC. Tony will prevail if he used the driveway for the statutory period. \u2013 This could be possible if the statutory period for adverse possession or easement by prescription has been met.\n\nD. Tony will prevail because the easement was due to necessity. \u2013 There's no information to suggest that Tony's property is landlocked or that the easement is necessary for access.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is likely C: Tony will prevail if he used the driveway for the statutory period, assuming that the statutory period for easement by prescription or adverse possession is less than or equal to 25 years.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that adverse possession typically results in ownership, whereas an easement by prescription grants a right to use the property. Since the driveway is entirely on Mort's property, and Tony is seeking to use it, an easement by prescription seems more applicable here than adverse possession.\n\nIn conclusion, the likely result is that Tony will be granted an easement by prescription to continue using the driveway, provided that he meets the requirements of open, notorious, continuous use without permission for the required statutory period, which in this case is 25 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
