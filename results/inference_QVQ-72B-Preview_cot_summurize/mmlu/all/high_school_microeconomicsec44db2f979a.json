                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of the following indicates that two goods are complements?\" And the options are:\n\nA. A positive income elasticity\n\nB. A horizontal demand curve\n\nC. A negative cross-price elasticity\n\nD. A demand elasticity greater than one\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what complements are in economics. Complements are goods that are used together, right? So, like peanut butter and jelly, or cars and gasoline. When the price of one goes up, the demand for the other goes down, because they're paired.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of these options indicates that two goods are complements. Let's go through each one.\n\nOption A: A positive income elasticity.\n\nIncome elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in consumers' income. If income elasticity is positive, it means that as income increases, people buy more of that good. This is typical for normal goods. But this doesn't directly relate to whether two goods are complements or not. So, probably not the answer.\n\nOption B: A horizontal demand curve.\n\nA horizontal demand curve suggests that the quantity demanded remains constant regardless of changes in price. This implies perfectly elastic demand, meaning even a tiny increase in price will cause an infinite decrease in quantity demanded. This seems more related to individual good's price elasticity rather than the relationship between two goods. So, maybe not this one.\n\nOption C: A negative cross-price elasticity.\n\nCross-price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price of another good. If the cross-price elasticity is negative, it means that when the price of one good increases, the demand for the other good decreases. This sounds exactly like what we'd expect for complements. So, this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOption D: A demand elasticity greater than one.\n\nI think this refers to price elasticity of demand being greater than one, which means the good is price elastic. That is, a small change in price leads to a proportionally larger change in quantity demanded. Again, this seems to be about the individual good's response to its own price changes, not about its relationship with another good.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems to be the correct answer because a negative cross-price elasticity indicates that two goods are complements.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In the case of complements, when the price of one good increases, the demand for the other good decreases, which indeed corresponds to a negative cross-price elasticity. For example, if the price of gasoline goes up, people might drive less, so the demand for cars might decrease, assuming cars and gasoline are complements.\n\nOn the other hand, for substitutes, like tea and coffee, if the price of coffee goes up, people might switch to tea, increasing the demand for tea. So, in that case, the cross-price elasticity would be positive.\n\nTherefore, a negative cross-price elasticity is indicative of complements, while a positive cross-price elasticity suggests substitutes.\n\nSo, yes, option C is the correct choice.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's quickly consider why the other options aren't correct:\n\nOption A: Positive income elasticity relates to normal goods and doesn't directly involve the relationship between two goods.\n\nOption B: A horizontal demand curve indicates perfect elasticity, which is about a single good's response to its own price, not about its relationship with another good.\n\nOption D: Demand elasticity greater than one refers to price elasticity of demand, which again is about a single good's response to its own price changes.\n\nTherefore, none of these other options directly address the relationship between two goods being complements.\n\nSo, the final answer is C. A negative cross-price elasticity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
