                    "text": " Okay, I've come across this question about Dershowitz and his views on torture. I have to be honest; I'm not entirely familiar with who Dershowitz is or his specific stance on torture. But the question seems to suggest that he believes some forms of torture are acceptable in certain cases. That's pretty heavy stuff. Let me try to wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand who Dershowitz is. A quick search in my mind tells me that he's a law professor, maybe from Harvard or somewhere, known for his work in legal theory and criminal law. But I could be wrong. Anyway, the question is focusing on his views regarding torture, particularly in situations where he thinks torture might be permissible.\n\nThe options provided are:\n\nA. having a sterilized needle shoved under the victim's fingernails\n\nB. electrocution at nonlethal levels\n\nC. submerging the victim in water so he or she feels as if he or she is drowning\n\nD. none of the above; Dershowitz thinks torture is wrong in all cases.\n\nAlright, so the question is asking which of these methods Dershowitz would consider appropriate in those cases where torture is permissible. The way it's phrased suggests that Dershowitz does believe there are cases where torture is acceptable, but I need to confirm that.\n\nI recall that Dershowitz has been controversial for his views on torture, particularly his argument that in some extreme circumstances, torture might be necessary to prevent greater harm, like saving many lives from an imminent threat. He's famous for proposing the idea of a \"torture warrant\" where a judge could authorize torture in such extreme situations.\n\nGiven that, it seems that Dershowitz does believe that torture can be permissible under certain conditions. So, option D, which says \"none of the above; Dershowitz thinks torture is wrong in all cases,\" is likely incorrect.\n\nNow, I need to figure out which of the methods A, B, or C he might consider appropriate in those permissible cases.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. having a sterilized needle shoved under the victim's fingernails\n\nThis sounds extremely painful and invasive. It's a form of torture that targets the fingers, which are very sensitive. The fact that it's sterilized might be an attempt to minimize infection risks, but it's still a brutal method. I can't imagine Dershowitz endorsing this as appropriate.\n\nB. electrocution at nonlethal levels\n\nThis involves using electricity to cause pain without intending to kill the person. It's another form of severe physical pain. While it's nonlethal, it's still torture. I'm not sure if Dershowitz would consider this acceptable.\n\nC. submerging the victim in water so he or she feels as if he or she is drowning\n\nThis sounds a lot like waterboarding, which has been a topic of debate in recent years. It's a form of simulated drowning, intended to cause the sensation of suffocating or drowning. It's considered by many to be a form of torture, but some argue that it's less severe than other methods.\n\nGiven Dershowitz's positions on torture, I recall that he has distinguished between different levels of torture and has suggested that some methods might be more acceptable than others in extreme situations. He might view certain methods as less severe or more justifiable if they can elicit information quickly to prevent imminent threats.\n\nBetween the options given, submerging in water to simulate drowning might be seen as less severe than having needles under the fingernails or being electrocuted. It's still torture, but perhaps Dershowitz considers it a lesser evil in certain scenarios.\n\nHowever, I should consider that all of these methods are forms of torture, and Dershowitz has been criticized for his views on torture. Maybe he doesn't endorse any specific method, but rather the idea that in extreme circumstances, some form of torture might be necessary.\n\nBut the question specifically asks which method he believes is appropriate in those cases where torture is permissible. So, it's likely that among these options, one is more aligned with his thoughts.\n\nLet me think differently. If Dershowitz believes that torture can be permissible in certain extreme cases, he might prefer methods that are highly effective in extracting information quickly while minimizing long-term physical damage. Submerging in water to simulate drowning might fit that criterion, as it can be very effective in eliciting information due to the intense fear of drowning, yet it may not cause permanent physical harm if done correctly.\n\nIn contrast, shoving needles under the fingernails or electrocution at nonlethal levels could cause severe and lasting physical damage, which Dershowitz might seek to avoid.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, I would guess that Dershowitz would consider option C, submerging the victim in water so he or she feels as if he or she is drowning, as the most appropriate method in those cases where torture is permissible.\n\nBut again, I want to emphasize that all of these methods are forms of torture and are morally reprehensible. Dershowitz's arguments about the permissibility of torture in extreme cases are highly controversial and go against international human rights laws and standards.\n\nSo, to answer the question:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
