                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"A decrease in the price of a particular product will result in...\" and the options are:\n\nA. an increase in demand.\n\nB. a decrease in demand.\n\nC. an increase in the quantity demanded.\n\nD. a decrease in the quantity demanded.\n\nHmm, I need to be careful here because I think there's a difference between \"demand\" and \"quantity demanded.\" I remember from economics class that demand refers to the entire relationship between price and the quantities that buyers are willing to buy, usually shown as a demand curve. On the other hand, quantity demanded is the specific amount of a good that consumers are willing to buy at a particular price.\n\nSo, if the price decreases, what happens to the quantity demanded? I think that when the price goes down, people are willing to buy more of that good. Like, if apples are cheaper, I might buy more apples instead of other fruits. So, that would mean that the quantity demanded increases when the price decreases. That sounds logical.\n\nBut what about demand? Is demand the same as quantity demanded? No, I don't think so. Demand is the whole curve, and quantity demanded is a point on that curve. So, if the price decreases, we move along the demand curve to a higher quantity demanded, right?\n\nWait, but sometimes people say that a change in price causes a \"change in quantity demanded,\" not a \"change in demand.\" So, option C seems correct: an increase in the quantity demanded.\n\nOption A says an increase in demand. I think that would require a shift in the demand curve, which happens due to factors other than price, like changes in consumers' incomes or preferences. So, if the price decreases, but nothing else changes, I don't think demand itself increases; it's just that the quantity demanded increases at the new lower price.\n\nLet me double-check this. Suppose there's a decrease in the price of smartphones. As a result, more people are willing to buy smartphones at that lower price, so the quantity demanded increases. But if there's no change in consumers' preferences or incomes, the demand curve itself shouldn't shift. So, it's not a change in demand, but a change in quantity demanded.\n\nI recall that in economics, this is called a \"movement along the demand curve\" versus a \"shift in the demand curve.\" A change in price causes a movement along the demand curve, while other factors cause the demand curve to shift.\n\nSo, in this case, since only the price is changing, it's a movement along the demand curve to a higher quantity demanded.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. an increase in the quantity demanded.\n\nWait, but option A says \"an increase in demand.\" Would that ever happen? Well, if something else changes, like if smartphones become more fashionable, then demand might increase, but in this scenario, only the price is changing.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the law of demand. It states that, all else being equal, as the price of a good decreases, the quantity demanded increases. So, that aligns with what I just said.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. an increase in the quantity demanded.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
