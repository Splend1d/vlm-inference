                    "text": "So I have this question about fungi, and I need to figure out which statement is not true. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says, \"They all are eukaryotic.\" I know that eukaryotes are organisms whose cells have a nucleus enclosed within a nuclear membrane. Fungi are definitely eukaryotes. In fact, they're more closely related to animals than to plants in terms of cellular structure and genetics. So, this should be true.\n\nOption B says, \"They all have rigid cell walls.\" Fungi do have cell walls, which provide structural support and protection. Unlike plant cell walls, which contain cellulose, fungal cell walls are made of chitin, the same material found in the exoskeletons of insects and crustaceans. Chitin is very strong, so it gives the cell wall a rigid structure. So, this also seems to be true.\n\nOption C says, \"Most are filamentous.\" Filamentous fungi are those that grow as long, thread-like structures called hyphae. These hyphae branch out and form a network called a mycelium. This is common in many fungi, like mushrooms and molds. However, not all fungi are filamentous. Some fungi, called yeasts, grow as single, oval-shaped cells, similar to bacteria. So, while many fungi are filamentous, not all are. Maybe this is the one that's not always true, but let's check the last option.\n\nOption D says, \"Some are photosynthetic.\" Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water. Now, fungi are known for their ability to decompose organic matter and absorb nutrients, but I don't recall any fungi that perform photosynthesis. Let me think about this. If some fungi are photosynthetic, that would be an exception to the general understanding of fungal nutrition.\n\nWait a minute, I think there might be some confusion here. While most fungi obtain nutrients by breaking down organic matter, there are some species that have developed symbiotic relationships with photosynthetic organisms, like in lichens, where fungi partner with algae or cyanobacteria that perform photosynthesis. But the fungi themselves don't perform photosynthesis; it's their symbiotic partners that do.\n\nSo, in that case, the fungi are benefiting indirectly from photosynthesis through their partnership, but they aren't photosynthetic themselves. Therefore, it's not accurate to say that some fungi are photosynthetic.\n\nGiven that, option D seems to be the statement that's not true about fungi.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's double-check. If I look up whether fungi can perform photosynthesis, I should find that they generally lack the necessary organelles, like chloroplasts, which are found in plants and some protists that carry out photosynthesis.\n\nYes, that's correct. Fungi do not have chloroplasts and cannot perform photosynthesis on their own. Any photosynthetic ability they might seem to have is due to symbiotic relationships with other organisms that can perform photosynthesis.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"some are photosynthetic\" is not true about fungi.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
