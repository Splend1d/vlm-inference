                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a parabola given by the equation \\(x^2 = y + 4\\), and we're looking at several circles of the form \\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\\) with different radii. We need to determine which of these circles has the greatest number of points of intersection with the parabola.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for two curves to intersect. At points of intersection, the coordinates \\((x, y)\\) must satisfy both the equation of the parabola and the equation of the circle simultaneously.\n\nSo, for each circle, I'll substitute the expression for \\(y\\) from the parabola into the circle's equation and see what kind of equation I get in terms of \\(x\\) and \\(r\\). Then, I can determine how many real solutions there are for \\(x\\), which will correspond to the number of intersection points.\n\nLet's start by expressing \\(y\\) from the parabola:\n\n\\[y = x^2 - 4\\]\n\nNow, substitute this into the circle's equation:\n\n\\[x^2 + (x^2 - 4)^2 = r^2\\]\n\nLet's expand this:\n\n\\[x^2 + (x^4 - 8x^2 + 16) = r^2\\]\n\n\\[x^4 - 7x^2 + 16 = r^2\\]\n\nHmm, this is a quartic equation in terms of \\(x\\). Solving this directly might be complicated, but perhaps I can make a substitution to simplify it. Let's set \\(u = x^2\\), so the equation becomes:\n\n\\[u^2 - 7u + 16 = r^2\\]\n\nNow, this is a quadratic in terms of \\(u\\):\n\n\\[u^2 - 7u + (16 - r^2) = 0\\]\n\nTo find the number of real solutions for \\(u\\), I can look at the discriminant of this quadratic equation. The discriminant \\(D\\) is:\n\n\\[D = b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(16 - r^2) = 49 - 64 + 4r^2 = 4r^2 - 15\\]\n\nFor real solutions, \\(D \\geq 0\\):\n\n\\[4r^2 - 15 \\geq 0\\]\n\n\\[4r^2 \\geq 15\\]\n\n\\[r^2 \\geq \\frac{15}{4}\\]\n\n\\[r \\geq \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} \\text{ or } r \\leq -\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\]\n\nBut since radius \\(r\\) is positive, we have \\(r \\geq \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\).\n\nNow, for the number of solutions:\n\n- If \\(D > 0\\), there are two distinct real values of \\(u\\), each corresponding to two values of \\(x\\) (since \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{u}\\)), totaling four points of intersection.\n\n- If \\(D = 0\\), there is one real value of \\(u\\), corresponding to two values of \\(x\\), totaling two points of intersection.\n\n- If \\(D < 0\\), there are no real solutions, meaning no intersection points.\n\nGiven the options for \\(r\\):\n\nA. \\(r = 1\\)\n\nB. \\(r = \\sqrt{2}\\)\n\nC. \\(r = 3\\)\n\nD. \\(r = 4\\)\n\nLet's calculate \\(D\\) for each:\n\nA. \\(r = 1\\):\n\n\\[D = 4(1)^2 - 15 = 4 - 15 = -11 < 0\\] \u2192 no real solutions\n\nB. \\(r = \\sqrt{2}\\):\n\n\\[D = 4(\\sqrt{2})^2 - 15 = 4(2) - 15 = 8 - 15 = -7 < 0\\] \u2192 no real solutions\n\nC. \\(r = 3\\):\n\n\\[D = 4(3)^2 - 15 = 4(9) - 15 = 36 - 15 = 21 > 0\\] \u2192 four real solutions for \\(x\\)\n\nD. \\(r = 4\\):\n\n\\[D = 4(4)^2 - 15 = 4(16) - 15 = 64 - 15 = 49 > 0\\] \u2192 four real solutions for \\(x\\)\n\nWait a minute, both C and D seem to have four points of intersection. But the question asks for the greatest number of points of intersection among the given options. Both C and D have four points, but perhaps there's more to it.\n\nMaybe I need to consider if there could be more than four points of intersection. Since it's a quartic equation in \\(x\\), the maximum number of real roots is four, which corresponds to four points of intersection. However, perhaps in some cases, there are tangent points or something, but from the discriminant analysis, it seems both C and D have four points.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if for \\(r = 3\\) and \\(r = 4\\), the number of intersection points is indeed four by solving the equations completely.\n\nLet me try solving for \\(u\\) in both cases.\n\nFirst, for \\(r = 3\\):\n\n\\[u^2 - 7u + (16 - 9) = u^2 - 7u + 7 = 0\\]\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\n\\[u = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 - 28}}{2} = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{21}}{2}\\]\n\nBoth roots are positive, so each corresponds to two points (\\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{u}\\)).\n\nThus, four points of intersection.\n\nSimilarly, for \\(r = 4\\):\n\n\\[u^2 - 7u + (16 - 16) = u^2 - 7u = 0\\]\n\n\\[u(u - 7) = 0\\]\n\nSo, \\(u = 0\\) or \\(u = 7\\)\n\n\\(u = 0\\) gives \\(x = 0\\), one point.\n\n\\(u = 7\\) gives \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{7}\\), two points.\n\nThus, three points of intersection in total.\n\nWait, that's interesting. For \\(r = 4\\), it seems there are three points of intersection, not four, because one of the roots \\(u = 0\\) corresponds to a single point, and \\(u = 7\\) corresponds to two points.\n\nBut earlier, based on the discriminant, I thought there would be four points. Maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nLet me double-check for \\(r = 4\\):\n\nFrom \\(u^2 - 7u + (16 - 16) = u^2 - 7u = 0\\), which factors to \\(u(u - 7) = 0\\).\n\nSo, \\(u = 0\\) or \\(u = 7\\).\n\n- \\(u = 0\\): \\(x^2 = 0\\), so \\(x = 0\\), one point.\n\n- \\(u = 7\\): \\(x^2 = 7\\), so \\(x = \\sqrt{7}\\) and \\(x = -\\sqrt{7}\\), two points.\n\nThus, total of three points of intersection.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought both C and D have four points, but now it seems D has three points.\n\nMaybe I need to check for \\(r = 3\\) again.\n\nFor \\(r = 3\\):\n\n\\[u^2 - 7u + 7 = 0\\]\n\n\\[u = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 - 28}}{2} = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{21}}{2}\\]\n\nBoth roots are positive, so \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{7 + \\sqrt{21}}{2}}\\) and \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{7 - \\sqrt{21}}{2}}\\), which gives four distinct real points.\n\nSo, for \\(r = 3\\), four points, and for \\(r = 4\\), three points.\n\nTherefore, the circle with \\(r = 3\\) has the greatest number of points of intersection among the given options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a geometric interpretation that can confirm this.\n\nLet me visualize the parabola \\(x^2 = y + 4\\), which opens upwards with its vertex at \\((0, -4)\\), and the circles centered at the origin with radii 1, \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), 3, and 4.\n\nFor \\(r = 1\\), the circle is small and doesn't intersect the parabola.\n\nFor \\(r = \\sqrt{2}\\), still no intersection.\n\nFor \\(r = 3\\), the circle is larger and intersects the parabola at four points.\n\nFor \\(r = 4\\), the circle is even larger and might intersect the parabola at three points, as one point could be a tangent point.\n\nWait, but in the algebraic solution, for \\(r = 4\\), we got three real points of intersection, while for \\(r = 3\\), we got four.\n\nTherefore, the circle with \\(r = 3\\) has the greatest number of points of intersection among the given options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a specific reason why \\(r = 3\\) gives four points and \\(r = 4\\) gives three points.\n\nLet me consider the possibility of tangent points.\n\nIf the circle is tangent to the parabola at one point, that point would correspond to a repeated root in the equation, meaning two points coincide into one.\n\nBut in our earlier calculation for \\(r = 4\\), we have \\(u = 0\\) and \\(u = 7\\), both giving distinct points, so no tangency is occurring.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if any of these points correspond to tangent points.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the possibility that for certain radii, the circle could be tangent to the parabola, resulting in fewer intersection points.\n\nBut based on the algebraic solutions, it seems that \\(r = 3\\) gives four distinct points, while \\(r = 4\\) gives three points.\n\nTherefore, the circle with \\(r = 3\\) has the greatest number of points of intersection among the given options.\n\nThus, the answer is C. \\(x^2 + y^2 = 9\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
