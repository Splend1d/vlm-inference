                    "text": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.\"\nMao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955\nWhich of the following later developments would most undermine the hopes expressed by Mao in the second-to-last line of the passage?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question about Mao Zedong's thoughts on agricultural cooperation in China. The passage is from his speech \"On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation\" in 1955, where he talks about the need to transform agriculture socially to prevent a widening gap between rich and poor peasants. He emphasizes the importance of co-operation and the elimination of the rich-peasant economy and individual economy in the countryside to ensure that all rural people become increasingly well off together. The question is asking which later development would most undermine the hopes expressed by Mao in the second-to-last line of the passage, which is about consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.\n\nSo, first, I need to understand what Mao is hoping for in this passage. He wants to see a socialist transformation of agriculture, where co-operation among peasants can help eliminate the differences between rich and poor, and ultimately strengthen the alliance between workers and peasants. Now, the question is, which of the provided options would most undermine these hopes?\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that the development of Special Economic Zones along the Chinese coast brought economic growth to China. Special Economic Zones (SEZs) were areas where market-oriented reforms were implemented, attracting foreign investment and promoting exports. These zones did indeed bring economic growth, but the question is whether this undermines Mao's hopes expressed in the passage.\n\nWell, Mao was advocating for a socialist transformation and co-operation in agriculture. The SEZs were more about market reforms and economic openness, which might not directly undermine his hopes for agricultural co-operation. In fact, they might be seen as complementary if the growth from the SEZs benefited the countryside indirectly. So, maybe not the best choice.\n\nOption B mentions political friction with the Soviet Union pushing China into the orbit of the United States during the Cold War. This is more about international relations and geopolitical shifts. While it's true that China's relations with the Soviet Union deteriorated in the 1960s, leading to China seeking better relations with the West, including the United States, this doesn't directly relate to the hopes Mao expressed about agricultural co-operation and the worker-peasant alliance. So, probably not the answer.\n\nOption C refers to the cooperatives of peasants on the farmland and an emphasis on countryside steel production bringing famine and poverty to the Chinese peasantry. This sounds a lot like the Great Leap Forward, which was a campaign from 1958 to 1962 aimed at rapidly transforming China from an agrarian economy into a socialist society through rapid industrialization and collectivization. During this period, large-scale agricultural communes were established, and there was a push for increased steel production, even in the countryside.\n\nHowever, the Great Leap Forward is widely regarded as having led to severe economic difficulties and a major famine, known as the Great Chinese Famine, which resulted in millions of deaths. So, if this option is referring to the Great Leap Forward, it would indeed undermine Mao's hopes for making all rural people well off together, as it led to widespread suffering and poverty among the peasantry.\n\nOption D talks about opposition voices in the Communist Party, led by men such as Deng Xiaoping, being rooted out and silenced during the Cultural Revolution. The Cultural Revolution was a period from 1966 to 1976 when Mao attempted to regain control over the party and society, leading to political purges and social upheaval. While this did silence opposition, it doesn't directly relate to the hopes expressed in the passage about agricultural co-operation and the well-being of the peasantry.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, option C seems to be the most directly relevant to Mao's hopes about agricultural co-operation and the well-being of the peasantry. The Great Leap Forward, which this option refers to, was an attempt to implement some of the ideas Mao had about agricultural co-operation and socialist transformation, but it resulted in disastrous consequences for the Chinese peasantry.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is option C: the cooperatives of peasants on the farmland and an emphasis on countryside steel production brought famine and poverty to the Chinese peasantry.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it again. Mao's hopes in the passage were about consolidating the worker-peasant alliance through agricultural co-operation and eliminating the rich-peasant economy to make all rural people well off together. The Great Leap Forward was an attempt to do just that, but it went horribly wrong, leading to famine and poverty, which directly contradicts Mao's hopes of making the peasantry well off.\n\nOption A, the Special Economic Zones, while important for economic growth, doesn't directly impact the agricultural co-operation or the well-being of the peasantry in the way described in the passage.\n\nOption B, about geopolitical shifts, doesn't relate to the agricultural sector or the worker-peasant alliance.\n\nOption D, the Cultural Revolution, was more about political purges and ideological campaigns, which again don't directly address the agricultural co-operation or the economic well-being of the peasantry.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
