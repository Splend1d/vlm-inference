                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: a worker on an assembly line takes 7 hours to produce 22 parts. I need to find out how many parts she can produce in 35 hours at the same rate. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rate at which the worker produces parts. If she takes 7 hours to make 22 parts, then her rate is 22 parts per 7 hours. So, her production rate is 22/7 parts per hour. That makes sense because rate is parts divided by time.\n\nNow, I want to know how many parts she can make in 35 hours at this same rate. So, if she produces 22 parts in 7 hours, how many parts in 35 hours? One way to think about this is to find out how many times 7 hours go into 35 hours. 35 divided by 7 is 5, right? So, it's 5 times as long.\n\nIf 7 hours give me 22 parts, then 35 hours should give me 5 times as many parts, which is 5 times 22. Let me calculate that: 5 times 22 is 110 parts.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check. Her rate is 22 parts per 7 hours, so in 35 hours, which is 5 times longer, she should produce 5 times as many parts. Yeah, that seems logical.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up a proportion: parts over hours equals constant. So, 22 parts over 7 hours equals x parts over 35 hours. Cross-multiplying gives me 22 times 35 equals 7 times x.\n\nLet me calculate 22 times 35. 20 times 35 is 700, and 2 times 35 is 70, so total 770. So, 22 times 35 is 770. Now, set that equal to 7 times x. So, 7x = 770.\n\nTo solve for x, I divide both sides by 7. 770 divided by 7 is... 7 times 110 is 770, so x equals 110. Okay, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option A is 220 parts, B is 770 parts, C is 4 parts, and D is 110 parts. So, according to my calculations, the answer should be 110 parts, which is option D.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Perhaps using the rate I found earlier, 22/7 parts per hour.\n\nSo, rate is 22/7 parts per hour. To find parts in 35 hours, I can multiply rate by time: (22/7) * 35.\n\nThat's (22/7) * 35 = (22 * 35) / 7. 22 times 35 is 770, divided by 7 is 110 again. Same result.\n\nI think I'm consistent in getting 110 parts. Let me consider if there's any other factor I should account for. Is the rate constant? The problem says \"at that rate,\" so I assume it's constant, no efficiency changes or anything like that.\n\nAlso, are there any units I need to watch out for? No, it's all in parts and hours, so that should be straightforward.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to see if there's a formula that fits this scenario. It's basically a direct variation problem: parts are proportional to time at a constant rate.\n\nSo, parts \u221d time\n\nOr parts = rate * time\n\nGiven that rate is constant, parts = (22/7) * 35 = 110, which matches what I got before.\n\nWait, but option B is 770 parts. Where does that come from? Oh, that's probably the total parts if I didn't divide by 7. Yeah, 22 * 5 = 110, but if I forgot to divide by 7, I'd get 770. So, it's a trap option.\n\nOption A is 220 parts. Maybe someone thinks 22 parts in 7 hours is the same as 220 parts in 70 hours, but that doesn't make sense here.\n\nOption C is 4 parts, which seems too low. Maybe someone divides 22 by 7 and gets approximately 3.14, but that doesn't fit.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is D. 110 parts.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the units. Parts per hour times hours should give parts. So, (22/7) parts/hour * 35 hours = 110 parts. Yes, that checks out.\n\nI don't think there's more to it. It seems straightforward once I break it down like this.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 110 \\text{ parts}} \\]"
