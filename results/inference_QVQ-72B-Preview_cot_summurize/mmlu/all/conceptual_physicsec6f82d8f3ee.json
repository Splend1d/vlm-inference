                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about gases: hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are mixed together at a certain temperature, and I need to figure out which type of molecule has the greatest average speed. The options are hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, or that all have the same speed on average.\n\nHmm, I remember from physics class that the speed of gas molecules depends on a few things, like temperature and the mass of the molecules. Since the temperature is the same for all gases in the mixture, that should mean that the average kinetic energy is the same for all of them, right? But wait, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen have different molecular masses, so maybe that affects their speeds.\n\nLet me recall the formula that relates the average speed of gas molecules to their mass and temperature. I think it's the root-mean-square speed formula, which is vrms = sqrt(3kT/m), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature in Kelvin, and m is the mass of the molecule.\n\nSo, if temperature T is constant, the speed is inversely proportional to the square root of the molecular mass. That means lighter molecules move faster on average at the same temperature.\n\nLet's check the molecular masses:\n\n- Hydrogen (H\u2082): each molecule consists of two hydrogen atoms, so its molecular weight is approximately 2 g/mol.\n\n- Oxygen (O\u2082): two oxygen atoms, molecular weight about 32 g/mol.\n\n- Nitrogen (N\u2082): two nitrogen atoms, molecular weight about 28 g/mol.\n\nSo, hydrogen has the lowest molecular mass among these.\n\nGiven that, according to the formula, the lighter the molecule, the higher its average speed at the same temperature, it seems like hydrogen molecules would have the greatest average speed.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something else I need to consider, like the specific heat capacities or something.\n\nI recall that at constant temperature, the average kinetic energy (KE) per molecule is the same for all gases. KE is (1/2)mv\u00b2, and since KE is the same, higher mass means lower velocity, and vice versa.\n\nSo, again, hydrogen being the lightest should have the highest average speed.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor that could influence this? Like the specific heat or the degrees of freedom of the molecules? I don't think so, because at constant temperature, it's primarily the mass that affects the speed.\n\nLet me consider the root-mean-square speed formula again: vrms = sqrt(3kT/m). Since k and T are the same for all, m is the variable here.\n\nSo, hydrogen with m = 2 g/mol would have the highest vrms, followed by nitrogen (28 g/mol) and then oxygen (32 g/mol).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. hydrogen.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about real gases versus ideal gases. Does the behavior change in real-world conditions?\n\nIn real gases, especially at high pressures or low temperatures, deviations from ideal gas behavior can occur due to intermolecular forces and finite molecular volumes. However, since the question specifies a mixture at a given temperature without specifying pressure, and considering that typical conditions for gases are close to ideal behavior, I think it's safe to assume ideal gas behavior here.\n\nMoreover, intermolecular forces in hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are mostly due to van der Waals forces, which are weak and shouldn't significantly affect the average speeds under standard conditions.\n\nTherefore, based on the ideal gas law and the root-mean-square speed formula, hydrogen molecules should have the greatest average speed in this mixture.\n\nI don't think the answer is B. oxygen or C. nitrogen, because their molecules are heavier than hydrogen's.\n\nOption D says all have the same speed on average, but that's not correct because, as we've seen, lighter molecules move faster on average at the same temperature.\n\nSo, my final answer is A. hydrogen.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ hydrogen}} \\]"
