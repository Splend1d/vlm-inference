The question is asking when the Inca began their military expansion across South America, and there are four options to choose from: A. 200 A.D., B. 900 A.D., C. 1450 A.D., or D. 1650 A.D.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall some history about the Inca Empire. I know that the Inca were a civilization that arose in the Andes Mountains of South America, and they built a large empire through conquest and diplomacy. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact timeline.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. I remember that the Inca Empire was centered in what is now Peru, and they had a capital city called Cusco. Their language was Quechua, and they had a complex social structure with the Sapa Inca at the top.\n\nNow, considering the dates provided:\n\nA. 200 A.D. - That seems too early. The Inca are generally thought of as a post-classical civilization, not emerging until much later. I don't think they were expanding their empire that far back in time.\n\nB. 900 A.D. - This is still quite early. I believe this was around the time of the decline of some earlier Andean civilizations, like the Moche and the Wari. The Inca were probably not yet a significant power at this point.\n\nC. 1450 A.D. - This seems more plausible. I recall that the Inca began their rapid expansion in the 15th century. Under the leadership of Pachacuti, the Inca expanded their territory significantly during this period.\n\nD. 1650 A.D. - This is after the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire, which started in the 1530s. The Inca Empire was largely defeated by the Spanish by the 1570s, so this date is too late for the beginning of their military expansion.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option C. 1450 A.D. seems to be the correct answer. The Inca began their military expansion across South America around the mid-15th century.\n\nJust to make sure I'm not missing anything, I'll double-check some key points. Pachacuti was an Inca ruler who reigned from 1438 to 1471, and during his time, the Inca Empire started to expand beyond their traditional lands around Cusco. His son, Topa Inca Yupanqui, continued this expansion, consolidating control over a vast territory that stretched along the Andes from present-day Ecuador to Chile.\n\nSo, yes, the Inca's military expansion began in the 1400s, making 1450 A.D. a reasonable starting point. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 1450 A.D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
