                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two situations presented, and for each, I have to decide if the main character's action is morally wrong or not. Then, based on my judgments for both scenarios, I have to choose one of the four possible combinations.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"I kept the fireplace empty as the chimney cleaner was in it.\"\n\nSo, in this situation, someone is having their chimney cleaned, and while the chimney cleaner is working inside the chimney, the person is making sure not to use the fireplace. That makes sense because if someone is inside the chimney, you wouldn't want to light a fire or use the fireplace in a way that could harm the chimney cleaner.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, keeping the fireplace empty while the chimney cleaner is in the chimney seems like a responsible and considerate action. It's showing concern for the safety of the person doing the work. So, in this case, it doesn't seem like doing something morally wrong; rather, it's doing the right thing to ensure someone's safety.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I don't think we should send astronauts into space without putting holes in their suits.\"\n\nThis one is a bit different. It's an opinion about space travel and astronaut safety. The statement is suggesting that astronauts shouldn't be sent into space without putting holes in their suits. Hmm, that sounds odd because intuitively, you'd think that spacesuits are designed to protect astronauts in the vacuum of space, and putting holes in them would be dangerous.\n\nSpacesuits are engineered to provide a pressurized environment, protection from extreme temperatures, and life-support systems. Putting holes in them would likely compromise these functions, potentially exposing astronauts to the lethal environment of space.\n\nSo, if someone is suggesting not sending astronauts into space without putting holes in their suits, it seems like they're either making a joke or misunderstanding how spacesuits work. Either way, if this were a serious proposal, it would be morally wrong because it could lead to harm or death of the astronauts.\n\nBut, considering the context, it might be a hypothetical or a rhetorical statement to make a point about preparedness or safety measures in space exploration. However, taken at face value, suggesting sending astronauts into space with holes in their suits is clearly morally wrong due to the potential harm it could cause.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Keeping the fireplace empty while the chimney cleaner is in the chimney is not wrong; in fact, it's the right thing to do for safety.\n\n- Scenario 2: Suggesting sending astronauts into space without putting holes in their suits is wrong because it could lead to harm or death of the astronauts.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check. In Scenario 1, is there any possibility that keeping the fireplace empty could be considered morally wrong? For example, if the chimney cleaner was trapped or in danger for some reason, and using the fireplace could have helped, but deciding not to use it could be seen as negligence. But that seems like a stretch. The scenario simply says that the chimney cleaner was in the chimney, and the person kept the fireplace empty. It doesn't provide any additional context that would make this action morally questionable.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the statement is clear: suggesting not sending astronauts into space without putting holes in their suits. This would effectively mean sending astronauts with compromised suits, which is dangerous and unethical.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Not wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
