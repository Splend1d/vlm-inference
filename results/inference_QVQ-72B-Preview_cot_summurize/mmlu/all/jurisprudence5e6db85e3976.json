                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Adherence to precedent is called the doctrine of ________.\" And the options are A. nolo contendere, B. stare decisis, C. substantial performance, D. commercial impracticability. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these terms refers to the idea of following previous court decisions.\n\nFirst off, I know that precedent is important in law because it provides consistency and predictability. Judges often look to past decisions to guide them in deciding current cases. So, the doctrine that describes this practice should be about sticking to established case law.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A is nolo contendere. I think I've heard that term before. It sounds like it might be related to a plea in court. Let me recall... Yes, a nolo contendere plea is when a defendant doesn't admit to the crime but doesn't dispute the charges either. It's sort of like saying, \"I won't fight this.\" But that doesn't seem to relate to adhering to precedent. So, probably not the right answer.\n\nOption B is stare decisis. This rings a bell. I think it's a Latin phrase that means \"to stand by things decided.\" Yeah, that sounds exactly like the concept of following precedents. Courts use previous rulings as a basis for deciding new cases. So, this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOption C is substantial performance. I'm not as familiar with this term, but I believe it relates to contract law. When a party performs most of their obligations under a contract, even if not perfectly, they might be said to have substantially performed. But that doesn't directly relate to the idea of precedent and following past decisions.\n\nOption D is commercial impracticability. I think this has to do with situations where performing a contract becomes too difficult or impossible due to unforeseen events. Again, that seems unrelated to the doctrine of precedent.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, stare decisis is the doctrine that refers to adhering to precedent. Let me just double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nI remember that in common law systems, precedent is a fundamental principle. The idea is that cases with similar facts should be decided in a similar manner. This ensures fairness and stability in the legal system. Stare decisis is the Latin phrase that encapsulates this concept.\n\nNolo contendere is indeed a plea in criminal law, where the defendant neither admits nor denies the allegations but agrees to be punished as if guilty. Substantial performance is a doctrine in contract law that allows for some deviation from perfect performance as long as the essential terms are met. Commercial impracticability is a defense in contract law that excuses performance when circumstances make it unreasonably difficult to fulfill the contract terms.\n\nNone of these terms directly relate to the concept of following precedents in judicial decisions. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. stare decisis.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility that another option could also fit. For example, could substantial performance somehow be related to precedent? Well, in a way, courts might look at past cases to determine what constitutes substantial performance, but that's more about applying the doctrine of precedent to a specific legal concept. It doesn't change the fact that the doctrine itself is stare decisis.\n\nSimilarly, commercial impracticability might be subject to precedent, but again, it's not the doctrine that governs the use of precedent.\n\nNolo contendere is completely unrelated to precedent in this context.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. stare decisis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. stare decisis}} \\]"
