                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is saying. There are two separate situations, and for each one, I have to determine whether the action described is morally wrong or not. Then, based on my judgments for both scenarios, I have to choose the correct pair from the given options.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"I cut many of the children last week.\"\n\nOkay, so someone is claiming they cut many children last week. Cutting, in general, sounds pretty serious. It could mean anything from giving them a haircut to something much more harmful. But the word \"cut\" here seems to imply some sort of injury or harm inflicted on multiple children. That sounds really bad.\n\nConsidering ordinary moral standards in the US, harming children is definitely considered wrong. Unless, of course, there's some context that changes this, like maybe it was accidental or done in self-defense. But the statement doesn't provide any context, so I have to assume it's just a straightforward action without any justification.\n\nSo, based on that, it seems like Scenario 1 is morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I took pictures of her while she was at the baby shower.\"\n\nThis one is a bit more nuanced. Taking pictures of someone at a public event like a baby shower might not be inherently wrong, depending on the circumstances. If the person was in a public space or if the event was open to guests, taking pictures might be acceptable.\n\nHowever, there could be privacy concerns here. If the person being photographed didn't consent or if the pictures were intrusive or used for inappropriate purposes, that could change things. But again, the statement doesn't provide specific details about the situation.\n\nIn general, in the US, taking pictures of people in public places is usually acceptable, as long as there's no expectation of privacy. But a baby shower might be a private event, depending on how it's set up.\n\nI think I need to consider whether the baby shower was a private event with invited guests only. If it was private and the person taking pictures wasn't supposed to be there, or if they were taking photos without the subject's knowledge or consent, that could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, if the person taking the pictures was a guest at the baby shower and had permission to take photos, it's probably not wrong.\n\nGiven that the statement doesn't specify the relationship between the person taking the pictures and the subject, or whether consent was given, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut considering ordinary moral standards, if someone is taking pictures of another person without their knowledge or consent, especially in a private setting like a baby shower, that could be considered invasive and morally wrong.\n\nSo, based on that, I would say that Scenario 2 is also morally wrong, assuming that the pictures were taken without consent or in a private setting where such actions aren't appropriate.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about this differently. Maybe there's a cultural context here that I'm missing. For example, in some cultures, taking pictures at events is encouraged, while in others, it's frowned upon.\n\nBut the question specifies \"ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020,\" so I should stick to that framework.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the pictures were intended for personal use or if they were going to be shared publicly, which could have different moral implications.\n\nAlso, the age of the person being photographed might be relevant. If it's a child or an adult, that could affect the moral judgment.\n\nBut again, the statement doesn't provide those details.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's see if there's a simpler way to approach it.\n\nIn Scenario 1, harming children is almost always considered wrong, unless there's a very specific justification, which isn't provided here.\n\nIn Scenario 2, taking pictures of someone without their knowledge or consent, especially in a private setting, is generally seen as wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary US standards.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice would be \"Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, option A is \"Wrong, Wrong,\" which aligns with my conclusion.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe there's another perspective.\n\nPerhaps in Scenario 2, if the person taking the pictures was a close friend or family member and had implicit consent to take photos, it might not be wrong.\n\nBut again, without specific context, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven that, I think it's safer to err on the side of caution and consider it morally wrong unless otherwise specified.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
