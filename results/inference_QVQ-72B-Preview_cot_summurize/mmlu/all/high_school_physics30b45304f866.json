                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about two carts colliding. There's a 1.5-kg cart moving, and it hits a 0.5-kg cart that's just sitting there, not moving. After they collide, they stick together and move off as one big chunk. The question is asking what properties these carts have immediately after the collision that are the same.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Velocity\n\nB. Kinetic energy\n\nC. Mass\n\nD. Linear momentum\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that when two objects collide and stick together, it's called a perfectly inelastic collision. In such collisions, momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy usually isn't.\n\nSo, momentum is conserved in this scenario. That means the total momentum before the collision equals the total momentum after the collision.\n\nLet me recall the formula for momentum: p = mv, where m is mass and v is velocity.\n\nBefore the collision:\n\n- The 1.5-kg cart is moving with some initial velocity, let's say v_i.\n\n- The 0.5-kg cart is at rest, so its velocity is 0.\n\nAfter the collision:\n\n- They stick together, so they move with a common final velocity, v_f.\n\n- The combined mass is 1.5 kg + 0.5 kg = 2.0 kg.\n\nSo, the momentum before the collision is (1.5 kg)(v_i), and after the collision, it's (2.0 kg)(v_f).\n\nAccording to the conservation of momentum:\n\n1.5 kg * v_i = 2.0 kg * v_f\n\nFrom this equation, I can solve for v_f:\n\nv_f = (1.5 / 2.0) * v_i = 0.75 v_i\n\nSo, the final velocity is 0.75 times the initial velocity of the first cart.\n\nNow, let's look at each option to see which one makes sense.\n\nA. Velocity\n\nFrom above, the final velocity is 0.75 v_i. But the question is whether immediately after the collision, the carts each have the same velocity as each other.\n\nWait a minute, since they stick together, they must have the same velocity after the collision. So, yes, their velocities are the same.\n\nBut let's check the other options to be sure.\n\nB. Kinetic energy\n\nKinetic energy is given by ke = 0.5 mv\u00b2.\n\nBefore the collision:\n\n- ke_1 = 0.5 * 1.5 kg * (v_i)\u00b2 = 0.75 (v_i)\u00b2\n\n- ke_2 = 0.5 * 0.5 kg * (0)\u00b2 = 0\n\nTotal ke before = 0.75 (v_i)\u00b2\n\nAfter the collision:\n\n- Combined mass = 2.0 kg\n\n- Final velocity = 0.75 v_i\n\n- ke_after = 0.5 * 2.0 kg * (0.75 v_i)\u00b2 = 0.5 * 2 * (0.5625 v_i\u00b2) = 0.5625 v_i\u00b2\n\nWait, is that right?\n\nLet me calculate it again.\n\nke_after = 0.5 * 2.0 * (0.75 v_i)\u00b2 = 1.0 * (0.5625 v_i\u00b2) = 0.5625 v_i\u00b2\n\nSo, ke_before = 0.75 v_i\u00b2, ke_after = 0.5625 v_i\u00b2\n\nClearly, ke is not the same before and after the collision.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for what properties are the same immediately after the collision as each other.\n\nIs the kinetic energy of the combined carts the same as what? Oh, I think I misread it.\n\nThe question says: \"Immediately after the collision, the carts each have the same ______ as each other.\"\n\nIt's asking which of these properties are the same for both carts after the collision.\n\nSo, for velocity, since they stick together, their velocities are the same.\n\nFor kinetic energy, since they move together with the same velocity, their kinetic energies are also the same, because they have the same velocity and their masses are combined.\n\nWait, but kinetic energy is related to the whole system, not individual carts. Since they're stuck together, they have a combined kinetic energy.\n\nBut the question is phrased to ask if they have the same something as each other.\n\nSo, if both carts are moving together as one entity, their velocities are the same, and their kinetic energies are combined into one value, but individually, their kinetic energies are different.\n\nWait, no. If they're stuck together, they don't have individual kinetic energies; it's the system that has a single kinetic energy.\n\nBut the question is a bit vague. It says \"the carts each have the same ______ as each other.\"\n\nIf we consider that after collision, they are one entity, then their combined velocity is the same for both masses, and their combined kinetic energy is also the same for both masses.\n\nBut perhaps the question is trying to ask if each cart individually has the same something as the other cart.\n\nIn that case, since they are stuck together, their individual velocities are the same, and their individual masses remain the same, but their individual kinetic energies are not the same as each other because their masses are different.\n\nWait, no. If they are stuck together, they don't have individual velocities; they have a combined velocity.\n\nAnd their combined kinetic energy is based on that combined velocity and mass.\n\nBut the question might be implying that each cart has the same something relative to the other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the properties of the system after collision.\n\nLet me consider linear momentum.\n\nBefore the collision:\n\n- Momentum of cart 1: 1.5 kg * v_i\n\n- Momentum of cart 2: 0\n\nTotal momentum before: 1.5 v_i\n\nAfter the collision:\n\n- Combined mass: 2.0 kg\n\n- Combined velocity: v_f = 0.75 v_i\n\n- Total momentum after: 2.0 kg * 0.75 v_i = 1.5 v_i\n\nSo, momentum is conserved, as expected.\n\nBut the question is about what properties each cart has immediately after the collision that are the same as each other.\n\nIf we look at each cart's momentum after collision:\n\n- The 1.5-kg cart now part of a combined 2.0-kg cart moving at 0.75 v_i\n\n- The 0.5-kg cart is also part of the combined cart moving at 0.75 v_i\n\nBut individually, their momenta are not separate; they are part of the combined system.\n\nSo, perhaps linear momentum isn't the right choice here, because it's the system's total momentum that's conserved, not each cart's individual momentum.\n\nSimilarly, for mass:\n\nBefore collision:\n\n- Cart 1: 1.5 kg\n\n- Cart 2: 0.5 kg\n\nAfter collision:\n\n- Combined mass: 2.0 kg\n\nSo, individually, their masses haven't changed, but since they are stuck together, their individual masses aren't separate anymore.\n\nBut the question is about what each cart has immediately after the collision that is the same as each other.\n\nIf we consider their individual masses, they still have different masses: one is 1.5 kg and the other is 0.5 kg.\n\nBut since they are stuck together, perhaps their individual masses aren't relevant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about their combined properties.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider that after the collision, the carts are moving together with a single velocity.\n\nTherefore, their combined velocity is the same for both masses.\n\nSo, in that case, their velocities are the same.\n\nSimilarly, their combined linear momentum is the same as it was before the collision.\n\nBut the question is about what each cart has that is the same as each other after the collision.\n\nIf I consider that both carts are now moving with the same velocity, then their velocities are the same.\n\nTheir masses are different, so their individual momenta are different.\n\nTheir kinetic energies, if considered individually, would be different because of their different masses, but since they are stuck together, perhaps individual kinetic energies aren't meaningful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to say that the system has the same something after the collision.\n\nBut the wording is a bit ambiguous.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best answer is A. Velocity, because both carts have the same velocity after collision.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nOption A: Velocity\n\nAfter collision, both carts have the same velocity, v_f.\n\nOption B: Kinetic energy\n\nIf we consider the system's kinetic energy, it's the same for the combined carts, but individually, their kinetic energies aren't separate.\n\nOption C: Mass\n\nTheir masses are different: 1.5 kg and 0.5 kg.\n\nOption D: Linear momentum\n\nAgain, the system's total linear momentum is conserved, but individually, their momenta are combined into one.\n\nTherefore, the property that both carts have the same immediately after collision is their velocity.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Velocity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
