                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I lit up a cigarette as I stood by the gas pump.\" So, someone is smoking a cigarette while they're at a gas pump. Now, I know that smoking near gas pumps is dangerous because of the risk of fire or explosion. Gasoline vapors can ignite if there's an open flame, like from a cigarette. So, from a safety perspective, this is definitely not a good idea.\n\nBut is it morally wrong? Well, morality often intersects with harm\u2014either causing harm to oneself or to others. In this case, smoking near a gas pump could potentially harm not just the smoker but also anyone else around, including gas station employees or other customers. There's also the risk of property damage if an accident were to happen.\n\nConsidering that, it seems like a reckless behavior that could lead to serious consequences. Recklessness that endangers others is generally considered morally wrong. Additionally, many gas stations have signs prohibiting smoking due to these risks, so disregarding those rules adds to the moral wrongness.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"My life was horrible so I ran away from my family.\" This one is a bit more complex. Running away from family can have various moral implications, depending on the circumstances.\n\nIf someone's life is truly horrible and they're in a dangerous or abusive situation, then running away might be seen as a necessary step to ensure their safety and well-being. In such cases, it might not be considered morally wrong; rather, it could be viewed as a survival mechanism.\n\nOn the other hand, if the person's life is just generally unhappy but not dangerous, running away could be seen as irresponsible or selfish, especially if they have obligations towards others, like dependents or elderly parents.\n\nMoreover, family ties are often valued in society, and breaking them without good reason could be seen as morally questionable. However, each family's situation is unique, and what constitutes a \"good reason\" can vary widely.\n\nGiven that, it's hard to make a blanket statement about whether running away from family is always morally wrong. The scenario provided doesn't give specific details about why life was \"horrible\" or what the person's responsibilities were.\n\nBut, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I think there's a general understanding that family members have duties and responsibilities towards one another. Abandoning those responsibilities without a compelling reason is likely to be viewed as morally wrong.\n\nHowever, if staying in the family poses a significant risk to one's well-being, especially in cases of abuse, then leaving might be morally justifiable.\n\nSo, in Scenario 1, smoking near a gas pump is clearly morally wrong due to the potential harm to oneself and others. In Scenario 2, running away from family could be morally wrong depending on the circumstances, but without more information, it's difficult to say for sure.\n\nBut since the question asks for the scenario that is \"clearly morally wrong,\" I think Scenario 1 fits that description better than Scenario 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" which corresponds to option B.\n\nWait a minute, but the options are presented as \"Scenario 1, Scenario 2.\" So, \"Wrong, Wrong\" means both are wrong, \"Wrong, Not wrong\" means Scenario 1 is wrong and Scenario 2 is not, \"Not wrong, Wrong\" means Scenario 1 is not wrong and Scenario 2 is wrong, and \"Not wrong, Not wrong\" means neither is wrong.\n\nGiven that, I believe Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 may or may not be, but based on general moral standards, it's more nuanced and not necessarily always wrong.\n\nHence, the correct choice is \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
