When the defendant came outside, he got into an argument with the parking official. After the defendant became verbally abusive, the parking official told him to desist or he was going to impound the vehicle.

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out whether the heroin and the marijuana should be excluded from evidence in the defendant's trial. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the defendant parked his car illegally in a handicapped spot and went into a store for coffee. A parking enforcement officer saw that there was no handicapped sticker on the car and started to ticket it. When the defendant came out, he argued with the officer, became verbally abusive, and the officer threatened to impound the car if he didn't stop. The defendant continued to badger the officer, so the officer decided to impound the car and called for police assistance.\n\nA police officer arrived, asked the defendant for identification, and frisked him for weapons. During the frisk, the officer found a clear vial containing heroin in the defendant's back pocket and arrested him. Meanwhile, the parking officer, who has statutory authority to conduct inventory searches of impounded vehicles in this jurisdiction, searched the car but didn't find anything interesting.\n\nAfter the police officer placed the defendant in the patrol car, he asked the parking officer if he could search the vehicle again, and the parking officer said yes. This time, the police officer found a bag containing marijuana under the floor mat.\n\nNow, the defense has filed a motion to exclude both the heroin and the marijuana from evidence. I need to determine whether the motion should be granted for the heroin only, the marijuana only, both, or neither.\n\nLet me start by looking at the heroin. The heroin was found during a frisk for weapons by the police officer. I recall that frisks are permitted under certain circumstances, particularly if there's reasonable suspicion that the person is armed and dangerous. In this case, the officer likely had reason to believe that the defendant might be carrying a weapon, given the defendant's verbally abusive behavior and failure to comply with the officer's request to desist. So, the frisk seems justified, and finding the heroin during that frisk would be lawful.\n\nWait, but I should double-check that. The frisk is part of a Terry stop, which allows officers to stop and frisk someone if they have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Here, the defendant was being impounded for illegal parking, and his behavior was verbally abusive, which might not be enough for reasonable suspicion of a crime. Hmm, maybe the officer needed more than just the defendant's badgering to frisk him. Maybe the officer had other reasons, like seeing something bulging in the defendant's pocket or something like that. But from the scenario, it doesn't mention any other reasons.\n\nLet me see. In Terry v. Ohio, the Supreme Court held that frisks are constitutional if there's reasonable suspicion that the person is armed and presently dangerous. Verbal abuse alone might not be sufficient for reasonable suspicion, but it could be part of the totality of circumstances. Maybe the officer felt threatened by the defendant's behavior and had a reasonable belief that the defendant might have a weapon.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look that up later. For now, I'll assume that the frisk was lawful, and therefore, the heroin found during that frisk is admissible.\n\nNow, moving on to the marijuana found in the car. The parking officer conducted an inventory search and didn't find anything. Then, the police officer searched again and found marijuana under the floor mat.\n\nFirst, the parking officer's inventory search is authorized by statute in this jurisdiction. Inventory searches are generally permitted without a warrant to protect the owner's property, to protect the police from later claims of lost or stolen items, and to assess whether there are any hazardous materials in the vehicle. So, that search seems lawful.\n\nBut then the police officer asked and was permitted to search the vehicle again and found marijuana. Is this second search lawful?\n\nI think there might be an issue here. The parking officer already conducted an inventory search, and now the police officer is conducting another search. Is that allowed?\n\nI recall that multiple inventory searches aren't necessarily permitted if they go beyond the scope of the original inventory search. The second search might be seen as a pretext for a criminal investigation, which could violate the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, if an inventory search is conducted by one agency, another agency can't conduct a second inventory search solely to look for evidence of criminal activity. So, perhaps the police officer's search was improper.\n\nAlternatively, if the police officer had independent reason to believe that there might be evidence of a crime in the car, such as smelling marijuana or seeing something suspicious, then they might have had probable cause to search the car.\n\nBut in this scenario, it doesn't mention any such indications. The police officer just asked to search the car again and found marijuana under the floor mat.\n\nSo, it seems like the second search might not have been lawful, meaning that the marijuana found during that search could be excluded from evidence.\n\nTherefore, the motion to exclude would be granted with respect to the marijuana only.\n\nWait, but what about the heroin? Is there any chance that the heroin could also be excluded? From what I can tell, the frisk seems lawful, so the heroin should be admissible.\n\nBut maybe there's a connection between the two searches. If the police officer only frisked the defendant because they were going to impound the car, and the impoundment was based on the parking violation, but then the officer found heroin, which is a separate issue.\n\nI don't see any direct connection between the two searches, so I think the heroin should be admissible, while the marijuana might not be.\n\nSo, the answer would be B. the marijuana only.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nPerhaps the impoundment itself was unlawful, which would make both searches invalid. But from the scenario, the defendant was being impounded for illegal parking in a handicapped spot without a sticker, which seems like a valid reason for impoundment.\n\nWait, but was the impoundment lawful? In many places, parking enforcement officers can impound vehicles for parking violations, especially in handicapped spots.\n\nAssuming that's the case here, then the impoundment is lawful, and the subsequent inventory search by the parking officer is also lawful.\n\nBut then, as I thought earlier, the police officer conducting a second search might not be permissible without additional justification.\n\nSo, again, the marijuana found during the second search might be excluded, but the heroin found during the frisk should be admissible.\n\nTherefore, the motion to exclude should be granted with respect to the marijuana only.\n\nAlright, I think that's the right conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
