                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which sampling method an auditor would use to estimate the dollar value of inventory. The options are variable sampling, discovery sampling, attribute sampling, and random-number sampling. I need to pick the one that's best suited for estimating a numerical measurement like the dollar value of inventory.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these sampling methods is used for.\n\nStarting with variable sampling: from what I recall, this type of sampling is used when the auditor wants to estimate a numerical value of a population. So, it sounds like it could be relevant for estimating the dollar value of inventory. But I should check the others to make sure.\n\nDiscovery sampling: I think this is a type of sampling used when the auditor is looking for rare incidents or exceptions. It's not really about estimating a value but more about finding out if certain errors or irregularities exist in the population. So, it doesn't seem to fit the bill for estimating the dollar value of inventory.\n\nAttribute sampling: This one is about testing whether items in the population have a certain attribute or not. It's often used to test controls in internal control systems. For example, checking if purchase orders are approved by authorized personnel. Again, not directly about estimating a numerical value.\n\nRandom-number sampling: This sounds like a method for selecting items from the population using random numbers, probably for any of the above sampling methods. It's more of a technique for selection rather than a type of sampling method that would provide an estimate of a numerical value.\n\nGiven these understandings, variable sampling seems to be the most appropriate method for estimating the dollar value of inventory. But just to be sure, maybe I should think about it differently.\n\nLet me consider the purpose of each method again:\n\n- Variable sampling: Estimates a numerical value based on the sample.\n\n- Discovery sampling: Designed to find rare occurrences, not to estimate values.\n\n- Attribute sampling: Determines the rate of occurrence of certain attributes, not for numerical estimation.\n\n- Random-number sampling: A selection method, not a sampling method per se.\n\nSo, again, variable sampling appears to be the correct choice.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about the characteristics of variable sampling. I remember that it includes techniques like mean per unit estimation, difference estimation, ratio estimation, and so on. These all sound like they could be used to estimate the total dollar value of inventory.\n\nOn the other hand, attribute sampling is more about yes-or-no type attributes, like whether an item is defective or not, which doesn't help in estimating the total value.\n\nDiscovery sampling is used when the auditor expects very few errors and wants to find them, which isn't relevant here.\n\nAnd random-number sampling is just a way to select items, it doesn't provide the estimation itself.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be variable sampling.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nSuppose the auditor wants to estimate the dollar value of inventory. They would need to select a sample of inventory items, perhaps using random-number sampling, and then use variable sampling techniques to estimate the total value based on the sample results.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the sampling method to estimate the numerical measurement, not the selection method. So, random-number sampling is a selection method, while variable sampling is an estimation method.\n\nSo, to rephrase: the auditor would use random-number sampling to select the items, and then use variable sampling to estimate the dollar value.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the sampling method for estimation, so variable sampling is the right choice.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if attribute sampling could somehow be used to estimate the dollar value. Suppose the auditor classifies inventory items as overvalued or not, but that would only give a percentage of overvalued items, not an actual dollar estimate.\n\nSimilarly, discovery sampling might help find significantly overvalued items, but it doesn't provide an estimate of the total dollar value.\n\nTherefore, variable sampling is indeed the most appropriate method for estimating the dollar value of inventory.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer is A. Variable sampling.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
