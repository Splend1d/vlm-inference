                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand how to correct for a negative externality. Let's see, a negative externality occurs when the production or consumption of a good imposes costs on unrelated third parties. Like, if a factory pollutes the air, that's a negative externality because it affects people who aren't directly involved in the production process.\n\nNow, the question is asking which option would internalize or correct this externality: a government subsidy, a government tax, a lower price, or a higher level of output.\n\nFirst, let's think about what it means to internalize an externality. Essentially, it means making the producer or consumer bear the cost of the externality, so that their decision accounts for the social impact of their actions.\n\nOption A is a government subsidy. A subsidy is when the government provides financial support to encourage production or consumption of a good. But if there's a negative externality, like pollution, subsidizing production might actually make it worse because it encourages more production, which could lead to more pollution. So, I don't think a subsidy would correct a negative externality; it might even exacerbate it.\n\nOption B is a government tax. This seems more plausible. If the government imposes a tax on the producer equivalent to the external cost caused by the production, it would increase the cost of production. As a result, the producer might reduce output or invest in less polluting technologies to minimize the tax they have to pay. This could help reduce the negative externality. So, a tax seems like a way to internalize the externality.\n\nOption C is a lower price. If the price of the good is lowered, it might lead to increased consumption, which could worsen the negative externality if consumption is causing the externality. For example, if the good is something that consumes a lot of energy, lowering its price might lead people to use more of it, leading to more pollution. So, a lower price doesn't seem like a correction for a negative externality.\n\nOption D is a higher level of output. If there's a negative externality associated with production, increasing output would likely increase the externality as well. More production means more pollution, generally. So, this also doesn't seem like a way to correct the externality.\n\nBased on this reasoning, option B, a government tax, seems to be the correct answer. By imposing a tax equal to the external cost, the government can internalize the externality, encouraging producers to account for the social costs of their production decisions.\n\nWait a minute, I should make sure about this. There's a concept called the Pigovian tax, named after economist Arthur Pigou, which suggests that a tax equal to the marginal external cost can help align private and social costs. So, yes, that reinforces my thought that a government tax is an appropriate way to internalize a negative externality.\n\nLet me consider if there's any scenario where a subsidy could internalize a negative externality. For example, maybe subsidizing the adoption of cleaner technologies that reduce pollution. But the question is about subsidizing the production itself, not necessarily the adoption of cleaner technologies. So, in that case, subsidizing production would likely increase the negative externality, not decrease it.\n\nSimilarly, with a lower price or higher output, both would likely lead to increased consumption and, consequently, increased negative externalities, assuming the consumption causes the externality.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. A government tax.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
