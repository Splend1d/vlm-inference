                    "text": "Alright, I've got this problem about a deed conveyance with some conditions attached to it. Let's try to unpack this step by step because it seems a bit complicated at first glance.\n\nSo, the homeowner conveyed his home and surrounding property to his daughter for life, then to his aunt for life, but with a condition: if the aunt moves to another state, then to the homeowner's sister for the life of the aunt, and then various provisions depending on whether the aunt moves or not, finally ending with the heirs of the aunt or the sister based on the aunt's residence.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand the different types of future interests because that's what this is all about. There are two main types of future interests: remainders and executory interests.\n\nA remainder is an interest that follows a life estate and is certain to vest, unless something happens to prevent it. It can be vested (where the person is already determined) or contingent (where it depends on some condition).\n\nAn executory interest is an interest that will take effect in the future if a certain condition is met, cutting short the preceding interest.\n\nNow, the problem is asking about the aunt's interest during the daughter's lifetime. So, let's map out the sequence of interests as per the deed:\n\n1. Daughter's life estate.\n\n2. Then, aunt's life estate, but with a condition that if she moves to another state, something else happens.\n\n3. If aunt moves to another state, then sister gets an interest for the life of the aunt.\n\n4. Depending on whether aunt moves or not, the property goes to different heirs after that.\n\nOkay, so the daughter has a life estate first. After her death, it's supposed to go to the aunt for her life, but with a condition that if the aunt moves to another state, then it goes to the sister for the life of the aunt.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Let's read it again carefully:\n\n\"then to my aunt for life, but if my aunt moves to another state, to my sister for the life of my aunt, then to the heirs of my aunt if my aunt does not move to another state, and to the heirs of my sister if my aunt does move to another state.\"\n\nSo, it's like:\n\n- Daughter's life estate.\n\n- Then, aunt's life estate, BUT with a condition: if aunt moves to another state, then sister gets an interest for the life of the aunt.\n\n- After that, depending on whether aunt moved or not:\n\n- If aunt did not move, property goes to aunt's heirs.\n\n- If aunt did move, property goes to sister's heirs.\n\nOkay, so the aunt has a life estate after the daughter, but it's qualified by the condition about moving to another state.\n\nNow, what is the aunt's interest during the daughter's lifetime?\n\nDuring the daughter's life, the aunt hasn't yet taken any interest because it's a life estate in the daughter first.\n\nBut the question is asking about the aunt's interest during the daughter's lifetime.\n\nI think what they mean is what is the nature of the aunt's future interest while the daughter is still alive.\n\nSo, the aunt is getting a life estate after the daughter dies, subject to the condition about moving to another state.\n\nBut is that a remainder or an executory interest?\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nThe daughter has a life estate, and then the aunt has a life estate, unless the aunt moves to another state, in which case the sister gets an interest for the life of the aunt.\n\nSo, the aunt's interest is a type of future interest that depends on her not moving to another state.\n\nIf she moves, her interest is cut off, and the sister gets the interest instead.\n\nThis sounds like an executory interest because her interest is dependent on her not moving.\n\nBut let's think more carefully.\n\nAn executory interest is one that will take effect in the future if a specified condition occurs, and it cuts short a preceding interest.\n\nIn this case, the aunt's life estate is subject to the condition that if she moves to another state, her interest is cut short, and the sister gets the interest instead.\n\nSo, the aunt has a life estate determinable upon her moving to another state, and the sister has an executory interest that will take effect if the aunt moves.\n\nBut the question is about the aunt's interest during the daughter's lifetime.\n\nDuring the daughter's lifetime, the aunt hasn't taken her life estate yet, so she doesn't have a present possessory interest.\n\nBut she has a future interest in the property, which is her life estate after the daughter's death, subject to the condition about moving.\n\nSo, what is that future interest?\n\nIs it a remainder or an executory interest?\n\nWait, perhaps it's a contingent remainder.\n\nA contingent remainder is a future interest that will vest upon the occurrence of a specified event, but it's not certain to vest.\n\nIn this case, the aunt's life estate after the daughter's death is not certain because it depends on her not moving to another state.\n\nSo, her interest is contingent upon her not moving to another state.\n\nTherefore, her interest could be considered a contingent remainder.\n\nBut let's see the options again:\n\nA. contingent remainder.\n\nB. shifting executory interest.\n\nC. vested remainder subject to complete divestiture.\n\nD. vested remainder subject to partial divestiture.\n\nOption A seems plausible because her interest is contingent on her not moving.\n\nBut let's consider option C: vested remainder subject to complete divestiture.\n\nA vested remainder is one where the interest is certain to vest in someone, but it may be divested under certain conditions.\n\nIn this case, the aunt's interest is not certain to vest because if she moves to another state, her interest is divested in favor of the sister.\n\nSo, it's a vested remainder subject to complete divestiture.\n\nOption D says vested remainder subject to partial divestiture, but in this case, it's all or nothing\u2014if she moves, her interest is completely divested.\n\nOption B is shifting executory interest.\n\nAn executory interest is one that will take effect in the future if a specified condition occurs, and it cuts short a preceding interest.\n\nIn this scenario, the aunt has a life estate subject to the condition that if she moves, her interest is cut short in favor of the sister.\n\nSo, the sister has an executory interest that will take effect if the aunt moves.\n\nBut the question is about the aunt's interest, not the sister's.\n\nSo, the aunt's interest is a life estate subject to complete divestiture if she moves.\n\nTherefore, her interest is a vested remainder subject to complete divestiture.\n\nWait, but is it a remainder or an estate in fee simple determinable?\n\nActually, it's a life estate determinable upon the aunt moving to another state, with an executory interest in the sister to take if the aunt moves.\n\nBut in terms of the aunt's interest, it's a life estate subject to complete divestiture.\n\nSo, perhaps option C is correct.\n\nBut option A, contingent remainder, is also tempting because her interest is contingent on her not moving.\n\nBut in reality, it's more accurate to say it's a vested remainder subject to complete divestiture because her interest is already vested (she has a right to it upon the daughter's death), but it can be completely divested if she moves to another state.\n\nOption B, shifting executory interest, refers to an executory interest that shifts the interest to another party if a condition is met.\n\nIn this case, the executory interest is the sister's interest if the aunt moves.\n\nBut again, the question is about the aunt's interest, not the sister's.\n\nSo, perhaps the best answer is option C: vested remainder subject to complete divestiture.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nVested remainder: the aunt has a remainder interest that is vested because she is alive and identified, but it's subject to complete divestiture if she moves to another state.\n\nYes, that seems accurate.\n\nOption D, vested remainder subject to partial divestiture, would imply that only part of her interest could be divested, but in this case, it's all or nothing\u2014if she moves, her entire interest is divested.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
