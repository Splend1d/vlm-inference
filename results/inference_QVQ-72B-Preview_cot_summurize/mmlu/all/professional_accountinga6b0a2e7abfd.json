They've given me four options: Theory of constraints, Economic order quantity, Balanced scorecard, and Cost-variance analysis. I need to figure out which one is the most useful in this situation.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with the Theory of Constraints (TOC), I recall that it's a management philosophy that focuses on identifying and improving the weakest link in a process. It suggests that every system has at least one constraint that limits its performance, and to improve overall performance, you need to identify and optimize that constraint. In manufacturing, this often refers to a bottleneck machine or process that limits production capacity.\n\nEconomic Order Quantity (EOQ) is a model used in inventory management to determine the optimal quantity of inventory to order at a time. It aims to minimize the costs associated with ordering and holding inventory. It's all about finding the sweet spot where ordering costs and holding costs are balanced.\n\nThe Balanced Scorecard is a strategic planning and management system that helps organizations align business activities to the vision and strategy of the company. It uses a combination of financial and non-financial measures to evaluate performance. It's more about ensuring that various aspects of the business are in harmony and supporting the overall strategy.\n\nCost-Variance Analysis is a method used to evaluate the difference between planned or budgeted costs and actual costs. It helps managers understand where costs deviate from expectations and make adjustments accordingly. It's primarily a tool for controlling costs and improving efficiency.\n\nNow, considering the scenario: the manager wants to increase profitability but is constrained by limited capacity of a critical machine. So, the main issue here is a bottleneck in production capacity.\n\nLet's see which of these techniques is most relevant to addressing this specific problem.\n\nTheory of Constraints is directly about identifying and optimizing constraints, which in this case is the critical machine with limited capacity. By focusing on improving the efficiency or capacity of this machine, the manager can potentially increase overall production and, consequently, profitability.\n\nEconomic Order Quantity is about optimizing inventory levels, which might help in managing costs and avoiding stockouts, but it doesn't directly address the capacity issue of the machine.\n\nBalanced Scorecard is a broad management tool that helps align activities with strategy. While it could indirectly influence profitability, it doesn't specifically target the limited capacity of the critical machine.\n\nCost-Variance Analysis is useful for controlling costs by comparing planned and actual costs. Again, this doesn't directly tackle the capacity constraint of the machine.\n\nGiven this, it seems that the Theory of Constraints is the most directly applicable technique to address the manager's problem. By applying TOC, the manager can focus on optimizing the bottleneck machine, which is the limiting factor in increasing profitability due to limited capacity.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other techniques could also be helpful, perhaps in a supporting role.\n\nEconomic Order Quantity could be relevant in ensuring that the manager has the right amount of raw materials available when needed, without overstocking, which could free up resources and reduce holding costs. However, if the main issue is the machine's capacity, improving inventory ordering isn't going to directly increase the machine's output.\n\nBalanced Scorecard might help in ensuring that all departments are working towards the common goal of increasing profitability, but it doesn't provide a specific solution to the capacity constraint of the machine.\n\nCost-Variance Analysis could help in identifying areas where costs are exceeding expectations, which might include the operation of the critical machine. However, it's more of a reactive tool for cost control rather than a proactive approach to increasing capacity or efficiency of the bottleneck.\n\nTherefore, after considering all the options, I believe that the Theory of Constraints is the most useful decision-making technique for the manager to apply in this situation. By focusing on the critical machine, the manager can implement strategies to optimize its use, such as reducing setup times, improving maintenance schedules, or finding ways to increase its capacity, thereby potentially increasing overall profitability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
