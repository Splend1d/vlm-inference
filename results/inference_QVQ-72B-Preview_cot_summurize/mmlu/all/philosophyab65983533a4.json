Influence the interests of others.\n\nC. Describe one's own approval of things.\n\nD. None of the above.\n\nI need to choose which one Stevenson would agree with.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall who Stevenson is and what his views on ethics are. I think he's associated with emotivism, which is a theory in meta-ethics that suggests moral statements express our emotions or attitudes rather than stating facts.\n\nSo, if I remember correctly, according to emotivism, when we make moral judgments like \"Stealing is wrong,\" we're not making a factual claim about the act of stealing; instead, we're expressing our disapproval or negative emotions towards it.\n\nGiven that, option A seems unlikely because emotivists don't think ethical judgments state facts. They don't see moral statements as truth-apt; that is, they can't be true or false in the same way that factual statements can.\n\nOption B is \"influence the interests of others.\" Hmm, that sounds interesting. Maybe Stevenson thought that ethical judgments are used to persuade or influence others' behavior or interests. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Maybe I should look it up.\n\nWait, I recall that Stevenson did emphasize the persuasive element in ethical discourse. He thought that moral language serves to influence others' attitudes and actions. So, perhaps option B is correct.\n\nBut let's consider option C: \"describe one's own approval of things.\" This seems similar to what I recalled about emotivism. Expressing emotions or attitudes aligns with describing one's own approval or disapproval.\n\nHowever, if I think about it, is the primary purpose just to describe one's own approval, or is there more to it? Stevenson might have thought that it's not just about describing one's own feelings but also about trying to influence others.\n\nWait, maybe both describing one's own approval and influencing others are parts of his view. But since I have to choose one, I need to prioritize.\n\nLet me see if I can find some more information to clarify this.\n\nUpon a quick search, I find that Stevenson's view is that ethical statements have two components: an descriptive element and an emotive element. The descriptive element states what is the case, and the emotive element expresses approval or disapproval.\n\nBut more importantly, Stevenson emphasized that ethical discourse is persuasive in nature. He believed that when we make moral judgments, we're trying to influence the attitudes and behaviors of others.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that option B, \"influence the interests of others,\" aligns closely with Stevenson's view.\n\nOption C, \"describe one's own approval of things,\" is also part of his theory, but it's more about the expressive aspect of moral language rather than its primary use.\n\nGiven that, I think the primary use, according to Stevenson, is to influence the interests of others.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
