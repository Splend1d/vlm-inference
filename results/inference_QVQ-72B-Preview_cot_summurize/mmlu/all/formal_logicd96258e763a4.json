                    "text": "Let's tackle this logic problem. So, the statement is: \"Cecilia breaks my heart if, and only if, Maria is either a problem or a girl.\" I need to translate this into predicate logic from the given options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"if, and only if\" means. In logic, \"if, and only if\" is a biconditional statement, which means that both conditions imply each other. So, Cecilia breaking my heart is equivalent to Maria being either a problem or a girl.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Bc \u2261 (Pm \u2228 Gm)\n\nB. Bc \u2261 (Pm \u2022 Gm)\n\nC. Bc \u2283 (Pm \u2228 Gm)\n\nD. Cb \u2283 (Pm \u2022 Gm)\n\nHere, \u2261 stands for logical equivalence, \u2228 for \"or,\" \u2022 for \"and,\" and \u2283 for \"implies.\"\n\nOption A says that Bc is equivalent to Pm or Gm.\n\nOption B says that Bc is equivalent to Pm and Gm.\n\nOption C says that Bc implies Pm or Gm.\n\nOption D says that Cb implies Pm and Gm.\n\nWait a minute, the problem uses \"Bc\" which likely stands for \"Cecilia breaks my heart,\" \"Pm\" for \"Maria is a problem,\" and \"Gm\" for \"Maria is a girl.\" The symbols make sense, but I need to ensure I'm interpreting them correctly.\n\nGiven that, the original statement is: Bc if and only if (Pm or Gm).\n\nSo, in logical terms, that's Bc \u2261 (Pm \u2228 Gm).\n\nThat matches option A.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption A: Bc \u2261 (Pm \u2228 Gm)\n\nThis means that Cecilia breaking my heart is equivalent to Maria being a problem or a girl. That aligns perfectly with the original statement.\n\nOption B: Bc \u2261 (Pm \u2022 Gm)\n\nThis means that Cecilia breaking my heart is equivalent to Maria being both a problem and a girl. But the original statement says \"either a problem or a girl,\" not both. So, this doesn't match.\n\nOption C: Bc \u2283 (Pm \u2228 Gm)\n\nThis means that if Cecilia breaks my heart, then Maria is either a problem or a girl. But this is only the \"if\" part, not the \"only if.\" So, it's incomplete.\n\nOption D: Cb \u2283 (Pm \u2022 Gm)\n\nThis one is different; it says that if Cecilia breaks my heart, then Maria is both a problem and a girl. But again, the original statement is about \"either...or,\" not \"both.\"\n\nWait, but \"Cb\" here might be a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be \"Bc.\" But assuming it's a typo, even if we correct it to \"Bc \u2283 (Pm \u2022 Gm),\" it still doesn't match the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the best translation is option A: Bc \u2261 (Pm \u2228 Gm).\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the statement.\n\n\" Cecilia breaks my heart if, and only if, Maria is either a problem or a girl.\"\n\nThis clearly states a biconditional relationship: Bc is true if and only if Pm or Gm is true.\n\nSo, yes, option A is the correct translation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
