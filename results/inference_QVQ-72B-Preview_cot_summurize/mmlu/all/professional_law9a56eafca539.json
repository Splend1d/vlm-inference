                    "text": "So I've got this contract situation here between a homeowner and a contractor. They agreed that the contractor would remodel the homeowner's garage for $5,000. But before they signed the contract, which was just one page, they realized that there was no completion date specified in the written agreement. They orally agreed that the work would be done in 60 days, but they didn't write that into the contract. They both signed it anyway. Now, the contractor didn't finish the work in 60 days, and the homeowner is suing for breach of contract. The question is whether the court will allow evidence of their oral agreement about the 60-day completion time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. There's a written contract that doesn't include a completion date, but there's an oral agreement that specifies 60 days. The contract doesn't have a merger clause, which I believe is important because a merger clause typically states that the written contract contains the entire agreement between the parties and that no oral agreements outside the contract are binding.\n\nSince there's no merger clause, maybe the oral agreement can still be considered. But I need to think about the parol evidence rule. I recall that the parol evidence rule generally prevents parties from introducing oral evidence to contradict the terms of a written contract. However, there are exceptions to this rule.\n\nLet me consider the options given:\n\nA. No, because the court must ascertain the meaning of the agreement from the terms of the written contract.\n\nWell, that seems to suggest that the written contract is the final and complete expression of the agreement, and therefore, no oral evidence can be introduced to change or contradict it. But in this case, the written contract doesn't have a completion date, and they did have an oral agreement on that point. So, it's not exactly contradicting the written terms because the written terms don't address the completion date at all.\n\nB. No, because the oral agreement was merely part of the parties' negotiations.\n\nHmm, negotiations typically happen before the contract is finalized. But in this scenario, the oral agreement was made just before signing the contract, and both parties were aware of it. So, it seems like more than just negotiation; it was a specific agreement they reached.\n\nC. Yes, because the contract is ambiguous.\n\nI need to think about whether the contract is ambiguous. The contract doesn't specify a completion date, which could be considered ambiguous in terms of when the work is supposed to be finished. But ambiguity usually refers to unclear or multiple possible interpretations of the contract terms. Here, it's more of a missing term rather than an ambiguous one.\n\nD. Yes, because the time limit is an additional term that does not contradict the partially integrated written contract.\n\nThis option suggests that the written contract is partially integrated, meaning that not all terms of the agreement are included in the written document. Since there's no merger clause, maybe the written contract doesn't intend to include all the terms, and thus, oral evidence can be admitted to\u8865\u5145 the written agreement with additional terms that don't contradict what's already in writing.\n\nLet me think about integration. A fully integrated contract includes all the terms of the agreement, and the parol evidence rule bars introduction of external evidence to add to or contradict the written terms. A partially integrated contract, on the other hand, includes some but not all of the terms, and oral evidence may be admissible to\u8865\u5145 the written agreement with additional terms.\n\nIn this case, since there's no merger clause, it might be considered partially integrated, allowing for oral evidence of additional terms like the completion date.\n\nAlternatively, there's the concept of consistent additional terms. Even if the contract is fully integrated, oral evidence may be admissible to explain or supplement the written agreement with additional terms that are consistent with it.\n\nWait, but without a merger clause, it's less likely that the written contract was intended to be the complete agreement.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the oral agreement is being used to enforce a term that was agreed upon but not included in the written contract. In some jurisdictions, if both parties acted on the oral agreement, the court might enforce it as part of the contract.\n\nAlso, considering that both parties signed the contract knowing there was an oral agreement about the completion date, it suggests that they both intended to be bound by that term, even if it wasn't written down.\n\nI should also consider the Statute of Frauds, which requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable. However, in this case, the main contract was in writing, even if the completion date wasn't specified. So, perhaps the oral agreement is enforceable as a modification of the written contract.\n\nWait, but modifications typically require additional consideration to be enforceable, unless there's a specific clause in the original contract that allows modifications without new consideration.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to summarize:\n\n- There's a written contract for $5,000 to remodel a garage.\n\n- Before signing, they orally agree to complete the work in 60 days.\n\n- The written contract doesn't include a completion date.\n\n- There's no merger clause in the contract.\n\n- The contractor didn't finish in 60 days, and now the homeowner is suing.\n\nThe homeowner wants to introduce evidence of the oral agreement about the 60-day completion time.\n\nQuestion is, will the court allow this evidence?\n\nOption A says no, because the court must interpret the written contract as is.\n\nBut in this case, the written contract doesn't have a completion date, so interpreting it as is wouldn't provide any information about when the work should be completed.\n\nOption B says no, because the oral agreement was just part of the negotiations.\n\nBut it seems like more than just negotiation; it was a specific agreement they both acknowledged before signing.\n\nOption C says yes, because the contract is ambiguous.\n\nBut I'm not sure if ambiguity is the right term here since it's more about missing terms than unclear terms.\n\nOption D says yes, because the time limit is an additional term that doesn't contradict the partially integrated written contract.\n\nThis seems plausible. Since the contract is partially integrated (i.e., not all terms are in writing), oral evidence can be admitted to\u8865\u5145 the written agreement with additional terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the contract is fully integrated, and the parol evidence rule would prevent introducing the oral agreement.\n\nBut given that there's no merger clause, it's less likely that the contract was intended to be fully integrated.\n\nMaybe the lack of a merger clause suggests that the parties didn't intend for the written contract to be the complete and exclusive statement of their agreement.\n\nTherefore, oral evidence of additional terms can be admitted.\n\nAnother thought: in some legal systems, if both parties act on an oral agreement, it can be enforced even if not in writing.\n\nIn this case, the contractor presumably started work with the understanding that they had 60 days to complete it.\n\nSo, their actions align with the oral agreement.\n\nGiven all this, I think the court is likely to admit evidence of the oral agreement about the 60-day completion time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: Yes, because the time limit is an additional term that does not contradict the partially integrated written contract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
