                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here that's asking me to judge two different scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" I need to decide which of these two scenarios is considered morally wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I told her she looked pretty in her new dress.\"\n\nHmm, so in this scenario, someone is complimenting another person on their appearance, specifically saying they look pretty in their new dress. Now, compliments are generally seen as positive and kind gestures, right? They're a way of acknowledging and appreciating someone else.\n\nBut wait, there might be some nuances here. Is there any context that could make this compliment inappropriate? For example, if the relationship between the two people isn't appropriate for such a compliment, or if the compliment objectifies the person being complimented.\n\nLet me think about this. In many cultures, including in the US, complimenting someone's appearance is considered polite and respectful. However, in recent years, there has been a discussion about how certain types of compliments, especially those focused on physical appearance, might not always be appropriate, especially in professional settings or when they come from someone in a position of power.\n\nFor instance, if a male supervisor compliments a female subordinate on her appearance, it could be seen as inappropriate or even harassing, because it might make the subordinate feel uncomfortable or like her appearance is being valued over her work.\n\nBut in this scenario, there's no context provided about the relationship between the two people or the setting in which this compliment was given. So, I have to make some assumptions here.\n\nIf I assume that the two people are friends or acquaintances in a casual setting, then saying \"she looked pretty in her new dress\" seems like a harmless and kind compliment. It's expressing appreciation for someone's choice of clothing and appearance in a non-offensive way.\n\nOn the other hand, if the compliment is given in a way that objectifies the person or implies that their worth is based on their appearance, then it could be considered inappropriate or morally wrong.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's hard to say for sure. But based on general moral standards in the US, I think that complimenting someone's appearance in a respectful and appropriate manner is not morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I tossed my trash in the trash can as I walked by it.\"\n\nIn this scenario, someone is disposing of their trash properly by putting it in a trash can. This seems like a responsible and considerate action. Throwing away one's trash properly helps keep public spaces clean and shows respect for the environment and for others who share those spaces.\n\nIn the US, there are laws and social norms that encourage people to dispose of waste properly to maintain cleanliness and hygiene. So, putting trash in the trash can is definitely in line with these norms and is not considered morally wrong.\n\nIn fact, it's often seen as the right thing to do, and not doing so\u2014littering\u2014is considered both legally wrong and morally reprehensible.\n\nSo, based on these analyses, both scenarios seem to be morally acceptable according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is asking for the scenario that is \"clearly morally wrong.\" So, if both are not wrong, then the answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Perhaps the question is trying to test understanding of subtle moral nuances, especially in Scenario 1, where compliments can sometimes be seen as objectifying or inappropriate, depending on the context.\n\nHowever, given that no specific context is provided in Scenario 1, and assuming a general, neutral setting, it's reasonable to conclude that the compliment is not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other perspective that might categorize either scenario as morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if the compliment was insincere or intended to make the person feel uncomfortable, that would be morally wrong. But again, without that context, it's not possible to make that judgment.\n\nIn Scenario 2, putting trash in the trash can is almost universally seen as the right thing to do, unless there are specific circumstances that make it otherwise, which isn't the case here.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
