                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 40-year-old woman who's been experiencing increased facial hair growth for the past six months. Her last menstrual period was four months ago, which seems off. She's 165 cm tall and weighs 70 kg, with a BMI of 26 kg/m\u00b2. Her vital signs are within normal limits: pulse at 80/min and blood pressure at 130/82 mm Hg. On physical examination, she shows temporal balding and has coarse, dark hair on her upper lip and chin. Additionally, during the pelvic exam, her clitoris appears enlarged. Her serum testosterone level is elevated, but her androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are all within normal ranges. An ultrasound of her pelvis reveals a 12-cm ovarian mass.\n\nAlright, so the first thing that jumps out is the increased facial hair growth, which is hirsutism, and the temporal balding, which might suggest androgenetic alopecia. The clitoral enlargement also points towards excess androgens. Her last menstrual period was four months ago, which could indicate oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, possibly due to hormonal imbalances.\n\nGiven that her serum testosterone is elevated, but other androgens like androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone are normal, it suggests that the source of the excess testosterone might be ovarian rather than adrenal. The presence of a 12-cm ovarian mass on ultrasound further supports this idea.\n\nNow, I need to consider the possible types of ovarian tumors that can produce testosterone. The options provided are:\n\nA. Granulosa tumor\n\nB. Ovarian carcinoid\n\nC. Sertoli-Leydig tumor\n\nD. Teratoma\n\nLet's go through each one.\n\nFirst, granulosa cell tumors. I recall that these are sex cord-stromal tumors that can produce estrogen, which might lead to symptoms like endometrial hyperplasia or even endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women. But in this case, the patient is showing signs of androgen excess, not estrogen excess. So, granulosa cell tumors typically don't produce testosterone, at least not primarily. Maybe sometimes they can have mixed features, but generally, they're more associated with estrogen production.\n\nNext, ovarian carcinoid tumors. These are neuroendocrine tumors that can produce a variety of hormones, including serotonin, which can lead to carcinoid syndrome. However, they're not typically associated with producing sex hormones like testosterone. So, it seems unlikely that a carcinoid tumor would be causing the androgen excess seen in this patient.\n\nThen, there's the Sertoli-Leydig tumor. This is another type of sex cord-stromal tumor, and I believe Sertoli-Leydig cells can produce androgens. In fact, Leydig cells are known for producing testosterone. So, this seems like a plausible option. These tumors can present with virilizing symptoms, which match the patient's presentation of hirsutism, temporal balding, and clitoral enlargement.\n\nLastly, teratomas. These are germ cell tumors that can contain multiple tissue types from different germ layers. They can sometimes produce hormones, but I don't recall them specifically producing testosterone in a way that would cause significant androgen excess leading to virilization. So, again, seems less likely compared to the Sertoli-Leydig tumor.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms of androgen excess, the elevated serum testosterone levels, and the presence of a large ovarian mass, the most likely diagnosis is a Sertoli-Leydig tumor. This type of tumor is known for its ability to produce androgens, which aligns perfectly with the patient's presentation.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider if there's any other information that might point towards another option. For example, if the patient had symptoms of estrogen excess, like abnormal uterine bleeding or endometrial hyperplasia, that might make a granulosa cell tumor more likely. But in this case, the symptoms are clearly androgenic.\n\nAlso, the size of the mass is noteworthy\u201412 cm. That's quite large, which could explain why it's producing enough testosterone to cause significant virilizing effects.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I'm confident that the best answer is C. Sertoli-Leydig tumor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
