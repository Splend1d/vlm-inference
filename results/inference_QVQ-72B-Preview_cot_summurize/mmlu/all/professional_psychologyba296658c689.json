                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question about whether a selection test discriminates against a particular racial group. There are four options, and I need to pick the one that would make it safe to assume there's no discrimination. Hmm, discrimination in testing can be tricky, so I need to think carefully.\n\nOption A says, \"No one from the group has applied for a position with the organization using the test.\" That seems weird. If no one from a particular group has applied, how can we know if the test discriminates against them? Maybe the test is biased, but since no one from that group has taken it, we don't have any data. So, this doesn't seem like a good reason to assume no discrimination.\n\nOption B says, \"The test manual demonstrates that the test is valid for a wide variety of jobs.\" Validity is important; it means the test measures what it's supposed to measure. But just because a test is valid for various jobs doesn't necessarily mean it's fair or non-discriminatory for all groups. Maybe the validity studies didn't include diverse populations. So, while validity is crucial, it's not sufficient on its own to ensure no discrimination.\n\nOption C says, \"The test rejects applicants from different racial groups in the same proportion.\" This sounds interesting. If a test rejects similar proportions of applicants from different racial groups, that might suggest that it's not biased against any particular group. For example, if 30% of all applicants are rejected, and within each racial group, about 30% are rejected, that could indicate fairness. On the other hand, if one group has a much higher rejection rate, that could indicate bias.\n\nOption D says, \"It is not feasible to conduct separate validity studies on male and female employees.\" This seems unrelated to racial groups. The question is about racial discrimination, not gender discrimination. Maybe the test doesn't discriminate based on gender, but that doesn't tell us anything about racial groups. So, this option doesn't address the issue at hand.\n\nSo, between the options, C seems the most relevant. If a test rejects similar proportions of applicants from different racial groups, that's a sign that it's treating everyone similarly, at least statistically. But I should think about this more deeply.\n\nI recall something about adverse impact in employment testing. The Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures suggest that adverse impact occurs when the selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group is less than four-fifths (or 80%) of the rate for the group with the highest rate. So, if the selection rates are proportional across groups, that would align with option C.\n\nBut wait, option C talks about rejection rates being the same across groups, while the 80% rule looks at selection rates. Are these the same thing?\n\nLet's consider an example. Suppose that in a group of 100 applicants, 60 are hired and 40 are rejected. For another group of 100, 70 are hired and 30 are rejected. The rejection rate is 40% for the first group and 30% for the second group. That's not the same, so there might be an issue.\n\nBut according to the 80% rule, we look at selection rates. In the first group, 60% are selected, and in the second group, 70% are selected. The ratio is 60/70 = approximately 85%, which is greater than 80%, so no adverse impact. Wait, but in this scenario, the rejection rates are different (40% vs. 30%), but according to the 80% rule, there's no adverse impact.\n\nSo, perhaps having similar rejection rates isn't the same as having no adverse impact. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is to ensure that the test doesn't disproportionately reject members of one racial group. So, if rejection rates are similar across groups, that could indicate fairness.\n\nBut in my example above, even though rejection rates differ (40% vs. 30%), the selection rates still satisfy the 80% rule. So, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nLet me recast this. If rejection rates are the same across groups, does that imply no adverse impact? Probably, because if fewer are rejected in one group, more are selected, which would satisfy the 80% rule.\n\nWait, in statistics, if rejection rates are equal across groups, then selection rates would also be equal, assuming equal group sizes. But in reality, group sizes differ, but the principle holds: equal rejection rates imply equal selection rates.\n\nHold on, let's do some math. Suppose there are two groups, A and B, each with 100 applicants. If the rejection rate is 20% for both, then 20 from each group are rejected, and 80 are selected from each. That's equal selection rates.\n\nIf rejection rates differ, say 20% for A and 30% for B, then selection rates are 80% for A and 70% for B. The ratio is 70/80 = 87.5%, which is above 80%, so no adverse impact.\n\nWait, but in this case, rejection rates differ, but selection rates are still within the 80% rule. So, perhaps having identical rejection rates isn't necessary; as long as selection rates comply with the 80% rule, there's no adverse impact.\n\nBut the option says \"in the same proportion,\" which suggests identical rejection rates. Maybe that's too strict, and in practice, as long as selection rates comply with the 80% rule, that's sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the test manual should demonstrate that selection rates are comparable across groups, not necessarily identical.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The question is trying to identify which condition would make it safe to assume no discrimination. Option C suggests that rejection rates are the same across racial groups. If that's the case, it's a strong indicator of fairness.\n\nOption C seems to be the best answer among the choices provided. It directly addresses the issue of fairness across racial groups by ensuring similar rejection rates.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any flaws in this approach. Suppose a test has the same rejection rate across groups, but the reasons for rejection differ based on group membership. For example, one group might be rejected more often on a particular item, even if overall rejection rates are the same. This could still indicate some form of bias.\n\nHowever, from a statistical standpoint, if overall rejection rates are the same, it's a good starting point. More detailed analysis might be needed to fully assess fairness, but for the purposes of this question, option C seems appropriate.\n\nSo, my answer is C. The test rejects applicants from different racial groups in the same proportion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
