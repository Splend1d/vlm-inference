                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about calculating depreciation using the double-declining balance method. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it.\n\nFirst, the company bought a computer on May 1 for $12,000. The estimated salvage value is $1,500, and it has a 3-year life. The question is asking for the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31 using the double-declining method.\n\nOkay, so the first thing I need to understand is how the double-declining balance method works. I know that in this method, depreciation is calculated at twice the straight-line depreciation rate, and it's applied to the book value of the asset at the beginning of each period.\n\nSo, first, what's the straight-line depreciation rate? For a 3-year asset, the straight-line rate would be 1/3 per year, right? Because you're spreading the cost evenly over three years. So, double that would be 2/3 per year.\n\nBut wait, standard declining balance method applies the straight-line rate doubled to the book value each year. So, for the first full year, I'd apply 2/3 of the book value.\n\nHowever, there's a complication here. The asset was purchased on May 1, so it's not a full year we're dealing with. The fiscal year ends on December 31, which means there are only 8 months left in the first year after purchase.\n\nSo, I need to calculate the depreciation for 8 months in the first year and then proceed with the remaining years accordingly.\n\nFirst, let's find the annual depreciation rate. Straight-line rate is 1/3 per year, so double-declining is 2/3 per year.\n\nNow, since the asset was purchased on May 1, and the fiscal year ends on December 31, that's 8 months in the first period.\n\nI need to find out how to apply the depreciation rate for 8 months.\n\nOne way to handle partial periods is to prorate the annual depreciation rate based on the number of months the asset was in service.\n\nSo, if the annual rate is 2/3, then for 8 months, it would be (8/12) * (2/3).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n8/12 is 2/3, wait, no, 8/12 is actually 2/3, but let me make sure.\n\n8 divided by 12 is approximately 0.666..., which is 2/3.\n\nWait, so 8 months is 2/3 of a year.\n\nSo, the depreciation for the first 8 months would be 2/3 of the book value at the beginning of the period, which is the cost of the asset, $12,000.\n\nSo, depreciation for the first 8 months: (2/3) * $12,000 = $8,000.\n\nWait a minute, but that's one of the options. But I think there's more to it because it's not just a straight 2/3 for the partial period.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the double-declining rate is applied annually, and I need to adjust for the partial period.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should calculate the annual depreciation and then prorate it for 8 months.\n\nSo, annual depreciation rate is 2/3.\n\nThen, 8 months depreciation would be (8/12) * (2/3) * $12,000.\n\nFirst, calculate the annual depreciation: (2/3) * $12,000 = $8,000.\n\nThen, for 8 months: (8/12) * $8,000 = (2/3) * $8,000 = $5,333.33.\n\nWait, that's another option. $5,333.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that 8 months is 2/3 of a year, so $8,000.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right. If 12 months is $8,000, then 8 months should be (8/12)*$8,000 = $5,333.33.\n\nSo, option C is $5,333.\n\nBut let me confirm if this is the correct approach.\n\nIn the double-declining balance method, the depreciation is calculated on the remaining book value at the end of each period.\n\nGiven that the asset was purchased on May 1, and the year ends on December 31, I need to calculate the depreciation for 8 months on the initial cost of $12,000.\n\nThe formula for double-declining balance is:\n\nDepreciation = Book Value * (2 * Straight-line depreciation rate)\n\nThe straight-line rate is 1/3 per year, so double is 2/3 per year.\n\nFor the first year, since it's only 8 months, I need to adjust the annual rate to reflect the partial period.\n\nOne common way is to apply the annual rate proportionally to the time in service.\n\nSo, Depreciation for 8 months = (2/3) * (8/12) * $12,000 = (2/3 * 8/12) * $12,000\n\nFirst, (2/3)*(8/12) = 16/36 = 4/9\n\nThen, 4/9 * $12,000 = $5,333.33\n\nSo, $5,333.\n\nBut I see that $8,000 is the annual rate, and $5,333 is the prorated amount for 8 months.\n\nBut I recall that in some declining balance methods, the partial period is handled differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the depreciation is calculated based on the number of months in service.\n\nLet me check the total months in the first year.\n\nThe asset was purchased on May 1, so from May 1 to December 31 is exactly 8 months.\n\nSo, perhaps the depreciation for the first period is based on 8 months.\n\nIn that case, the annual depreciation would be 2/3 * $12,000 = $8,000.\n\nThen, for 8 months, it would be $8,000 * (8/12) = $5,333.33.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the depreciation for the first partial period is calculated differently.\n\nLet me consider the monthly depreciation rate.\n\nIf the annual rate is 2/3, then the monthly rate would be (2/3)/12 = 2/36 = 1/18 per month.\n\nThen, for 8 months, depreciation would be 8 * (1/18) * $12,000 = (8/18) * $12,000 = (4/9) * $12,000 = $5,333.33\n\nAgain, that brings me back to $5,333.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because option A is $8,000, which is the annual rate, and option C is $5,333, which is the prorated amount.\n\nGiven that it's only 8 months in the first year, I think $5,333 is the correct amount for the first partial period.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that in the double-declining balance method, the depreciation is higher in the earlier years, which aligns with the name \"declining balance.\"\n\nSo, applying 2/3 of the book value for 8 months seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the depreciation expense for the first 8 months would be $5,333.\n\nThen, for subsequent years, I would use the remaining book value and apply the same rate, but since the question only asks for the first year ended December 31, I don't need to go further.\n\nSo, my answer is $5,333.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
