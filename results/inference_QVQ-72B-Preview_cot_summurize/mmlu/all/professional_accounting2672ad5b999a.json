Emerging Issues Task Force Releases.\n\nC. Statements of Financial Accounting Standards.\n\nD. Staff Technical Bulletins.\n\nHmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that the FASB is the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and they're responsible for setting accounting standards in the United States. The Accounting Standards Codification is like their master guide for all generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nNow, I need to know how they update or change this codification. Let's think about each option:\n\nA. Accounting Standards Updates: I've heard of these. I think they're the primary way the FASB makes changes to the codification. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the only way or if there are other methods.\n\nB. Emerging Issues Task Force Releases: I recall that the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) is a group that the FASB oversees. They deal with new accounting issues that haven't been addressed yet. Maybe their releases can influence the codification, but I'm not sure if they directly change it.\n\nC. Statements of Financial Accounting Standards: These were like the main outputs of the FASB before the codification was implemented. They used to issue these statements to set accounting standards. But I think that since the codification was introduced in 2009, they might not use these statements anymore for updates.\n\nD. Staff Technical Bulletins: These sound like guidance from the FASB staff, but I don't remember if these have the authority to change the codification itself.\n\nLet me consider the timeline. The codification was introduced in 2009 to simplify and organize all the existing accounting standards. So, anything before that, like the Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, would have been incorporated into the codification.\n\nTherefore, after 2009, the FASB would need a way to update the codification when new standards are issued or existing ones are amended. That's probably where Accounting Standards Updates come in.\n\nI should check when Emerging Issues Task Force Releases happen. I think the EITF discusses and resolves emerging accounting issues, and their consensus positions are often incorporated into the codification through Accounting Standards Updates.\n\nStaff Technical Bulletins seem more like interpretative guidance, perhaps providing explanations or examples, but I don't think they directly change the codification.\n\nSo, my best guess is that Accounting Standards Updates are the primary vehicle for making changes to the Accounting Standards Codification.\n\nBut to be sure, maybe I should look up some resources or recall if there's any official information about this process.\n\nWait, I think that Accounting Standards Updates are officially recognized as the mechanism for amending the codification. They can add new sections, remove old ones, or modify existing standards.\n\nAlso, I recall that the codification is structured in such a way that it should be the single source of authoritative GAAP, and updates ensure that it remains current and relevant.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems logical that Accounting Standards Updates are the way the FASB makes changes to the codification.\n\nI should also consider if there are any exceptions or other methods that could be used alongside updates.\n\nFor example, sometimes the FASB might issue interpretations or implementation guidance, but I think even that is typically incorporated into the codification through updates.\n\nEmerging Issues Task Force Releases, as I mentioned earlier, are likely to be reflected in the codification through updates, but they don't directly change it on their own.\n\nSimilarly, Staff Technical Bulletins might provide additional clarification, but they wouldn't have the authority to amend the codification.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that Accounting Standards Updates are the correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider the definition of each option:\n\nA. Accounting Standards Updates: These are official releases by the FASB that amend the codification.\n\nB. Emerging Issues Task Force Releases: These are consensus positions reached by the EITF on emerging accounting issues, which are then often formalized through Accounting Standards Updates.\n\nC. Statements of Financial Accounting Standards: These were the primary means of issuing new accounting standards before the codification was implemented in 2009.\n\nD. Staff Technical Bulletins: These are likely to be guidance provided by the FASB staff, which may not have the same authoritative weight as updates.\n\nGiven this, option A seems to be the most appropriate choice.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about whether there are multiple ways to change the codification.\n\nBut based on my understanding, Accounting Standards Updates are indeed the primary and perhaps the only direct way to amend the codification.\n\nSo, my final answer is A. Accounting Standards Updates.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
