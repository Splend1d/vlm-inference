                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about asteroids and comets based on the Solar Nebular theory. I need to choose which statement best describes them. The options are:\n\nA. They are the shattered remains of collisions between planets.\n\nB. They are chunks of rock or ice that condensed long after the planets and moons had formed.\n\nC. They are chunks of rock or ice that were expelled from planets by volcanoes.\n\nD. They are leftover planetesimals that never accreted into planets.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what the Solar Nebular theory is. From what I remember, it's the leading explanation for the formation of our solar system. It suggests that the solar system formed from a rotating disk of gas and dust called the solar nebula. At the center of this nebula, the sun formed, and around it, planets and other smaller bodies took shape.\n\nNow, specifically about asteroids and comets. These are typically referred to as minor planets or small solar system bodies. They're much smaller than the major planets and can be found throughout the solar system, but mostly in certain regions like the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and the Kuiper belt beyond Neptune.\n\nAccording to the Solar Nebular theory, these bodies didn't quite make it into full-fledged planets. So, option D seems plausible: they are leftover planetesimals that never accreted into planets.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one to make sure.\n\nOption A says they are the shattered remains of collisions between planets. Hmm, while it's true that collisions can occur in space, and sometimes planets might have collided or near-collided with each other, the current understanding is that asteroids and comets are primarily left over from the planet-forming process, not the result of collisions afterward. So, this seems less likely.\n\nOption B suggests they condensed long after the planets and moons had formed. But according to the Solar Nebular theory, the formation of the solar system was a more or less simultaneous process, with the sun forming first and then the planets condensing from the remaining material in the nebula. Asteroids and comets are thought to have formed alongside the planets, not after. So, this option doesn't seem to align with the theory.\n\nOption C proposes that they were expelled from planets by volcanoes. While it's possible that some material could be ejected from a planet's surface by volcanic activity, this isn't the primary source of asteroids and comets. Moreover, the Solar Nebular theory focuses on the initial formation of the solar system, not on processes that occurred after the planets had formed.\n\nOption D again: leftover planetesimals that never accreted into planets. This seems to fit well with the Solar Nebular theory. Planetesimals were the building blocks of the planets, and not all of them collided and merged to form larger planets. Some were left behind, becoming the asteroids and comets we see today.\n\nJust to double-check, I recall that the asteroid belt is a region where many asteroids are found, located between Mars and Jupiter. It's thought that these asteroids are remnants from the early solar system that couldn't form into a planet due to the gravitational influence of Jupiter.\n\nSimilarly, comets are icy bodies that originate from the outer parts of the solar system, like the Oort cloud or the Kuiper belt. They are also believed to be leftover material from the early solar system, preserved in the cold outer regions.\n\nSo, based on this, option D seems to be the correct answer: asteroids and comets are leftover planetesimals that never accreted into planets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
