                    "text": "Let's tackle this statistics problem step by step. So, we're dealing with a normal distribution since it's assumed that the LSAT scores are normally distributed. Here's what we know:\n\n- The mean (\u03bc) of the LSAT scores is 650.\n\n- The standard deviation (\u03c3) is 45.\n\n- We're interested in applicants who have scores above 700.\n\n- Among these, we need to find the percentage who have scores below 740.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says that only applicants with scores above 700 are considered, and then among these, we need to find the percentage who have scores below 740.\n\nSo, first, I need to understand the scenario properly. It seems like the law school only considers applicants who score above 700, and among those considered, we need to find what percentage have scores below 740.\n\nAlright, to approach this, I think I should first find the proportion of applicants who are considered, i.e., those above 700, and then find the proportion of those considered applicants who are below 740.\n\nBut since it's a normal distribution, I can use z-scores to find these proportions.\n\nFirst, let's find the z-score for 700.\n\nThe formula for z-score is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(x - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( x \\) is the value (700 in this case)\n\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean (650)\n\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation (45)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(700 - 650)}{45} = \\frac{50}{45} \\approx 1.111 \\]\n\nSo, z \u2248 1.111.\n\nNow, the proportion of applicants who score above 700 is:\n\n\\[ p(X > 700) = 1 - p(X \\leq 700) = 1 - \\Phi(1.111) \\]\n\nWhere \\( \\Phi \\) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.\n\nLooking up the standard normal table, \\( \\Phi(1.11) \\approx 0.8665 \\), so:\n\n\\[ p(X > 700) = 1 - 0.8665 = 0.1335 \\]\n\nSo, approximately 13.35% of applicants are considered (have scores above 700).\n\nNow, among these considered applicants, we need to find the percentage who have scores below 740.\n\nIn other words, we need to find:\n\n\\[ p(X < 740 | X > 700) \\]\n\nThis is a conditional probability. We can use the definition of conditional probability for continuous distributions.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of the truncated normal distribution, where we're only considering the part of the distribution above 700.\n\nBut maybe there's a simpler way to approach this using z-scores and the properties of normal distributions.\n\nLet's find the z-score for 740.\n\nAgain, using the z-score formula:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(740 - 650)}{45} = \\frac{90}{45} = 2 \\]\n\nSo, z = 2.\n\nNow, we need to find the proportion below 740, given that we're already above 700.\n\nSo, \\( p(700 < X < 740) \\) divided by \\( p(X > 700) \\).\n\nWait, no. Actually, \\( p(700 < X < 740) \\) divided by \\( p(X > 700) \\) would give the conditional probability \\( p(700 < X < 740 | X > 700) \\).\n\nBut we need \\( p(X < 740 | X > 700) \\), which includes both \\( p(700 < X < 740) \\) and \\( p(X = 700 \\text{ and } X < 740) \\), but since it's a continuous distribution, \\( p(X = 700) = 0 \\), so it's effectively \\( p(700 < X < 740) \\) divided by \\( p(X > 700) \\).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, first, find \\( p(700 < X < 740) \\), and then divide it by \\( p(X > 700) \\).\n\nLet's find \\( p(700 < X < 740) \\).\n\nWe already have z-scores for 700 and 740.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\n\\( z_{700} \\approx 1.111 \\)\n\n\\( z_{740} = 2 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ p(700 < X < 740) = \\Phi(2) - \\Phi(1.111) \\]\n\nLooking up the standard normal table:\n\n\\( \\Phi(2) \\approx 0.9772 \\)\n\n\\( \\Phi(1.11) \\approx 0.8665 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ p(700 < X < 740) \\approx 0.9772 - 0.8665 = 0.1107 \\]\n\nNow, we already have \\( p(X > 700) \\approx 0.1335 \\)\n\nSo, the conditional probability is:\n\n\\[ p(X < 740 | X > 700) = \\frac{p(700 < X < 740)}{p(X > 700)} \\approx \\frac{0.1107}{0.1335} \\approx 0.829 \\]\n\nSo, approximately 82.9%.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options:\n\nA. 13.3%\n\nB. 17.1%\n\nC. 82.9%\n\nD. 86.7%\n\nSo, 82.9% matches option C.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, z-score for 700:\n\n\\( z = \\frac{700 - 650}{45} = \\frac{50}{45} \\approx 1.111 \\)\n\n\\( \\Phi(1.11) \\approx 0.8665 \\)\n\n\\( p(X > 700) = 1 - 0.8665 = 0.1335 \\)\n\nZ-score for 740:\n\n\\( z = \\frac{740 - 650}{45} = \\frac{90}{45} = 2 \\)\n\n\\( \\Phi(2) \\approx 0.9772 \\)\n\n\\( p(700 < X < 740) = 0.9772 - 0.8665 = 0.1107 \\)\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ p(X < 740 | X > 700) = \\frac{0.1107}{0.1335} \\approx 0.829 \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the truncated normal distribution, where the distribution is conditioned on being above 700.\n\nIn that case, the mean and standard deviation of the truncated distribution would be different, but calculating that might be more complicated, and I think the approach I took is sufficient for this problem.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 82.9%, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
