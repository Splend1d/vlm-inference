It says that people who believe their political views are important, that the government will respect these views, and that their views can influence political affairs are said to have a strong sense of... and then there are four options: A. political partisanship, B. political alienation, C. political allegiance, D. political efficacy.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. The question is talking about people who feel their opinions matter and can make a difference in politics. So, it's about feeling effective or having an impact through one's political views.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: political partisanship. I know that partisanship refers to supporting a particular political party or group. So, it's more about alignment with a specific political entity rather than feeling that one's views can influence political affairs directly. Maybe not the best fit.\n\nOption B: political alienation. Alienation sounds like the opposite of what's being described. Alienation is when people feel disconnected or excluded from the political process. But the question is about people who feel their views are important and can influence politics. That seems like the opposite of alienation. So, probably not this one.\n\nOption C: political allegiance. Allegiance means loyalty or support for a particular cause or group. Again, this seems more about supporting something rather than feeling that one's views can actively influence political affairs. Maybe not quite there.\n\nOption D: political efficacy. Now, this sounds promising. Efficacy means the ability to produce a desired or intended result. Political efficacy would refer to the belief that one can influence or bring about change in the political sphere. That seems to match perfectly with the description in the question.\n\nLet me double-check. The question says: believing that your political views are important, that the government will respect them, and that they can influence political affairs. That sounds a lot like feeling efficacious in the political realm.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, D. political efficacy seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, just to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any confusion.\n\nPolitical partisanship is about aligning with a party, which isn't directly about feeling that your views can influence politics.\n\nPolitical alienation is the feeling of being outsiders, which again, doesn't match the description.\n\nPolitical allegiance is about loyalty, which isn't specifically about influencing political affairs.\n\nPolitical efficacy is exactly about believing that you can make a difference in politics, which fits perfectly with the question.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. political efficacy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
