                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which defense mechanism Max is using in this situation. Let me first understand what's happening. Suzy decided to go to the prom with Dylan instead of Max, and Max is feeling really upset about it. He's so angry that he's putting all his energy into his artwork. Okay, so he's directing his feelings towards creating art instead of expressing his anger directly.\n\nNow, I need to match this behavior with one of the defense mechanisms listed: displacement, sublimation, rationalization, or repression. Let me recall what each of these means.\n\nStarting with displacement: I think it's when someone feels angry or upset about something and then takes it out on someone or something else that's safer or easier to target. Like, if you're mad at your boss, you might come home and yell at your dog. So, in this case, Max is upset about Suzy choosing Dylan, but instead of being angry at Suzy or Dylan, he's putting his energy into his artwork. Hmm, that sounds a bit like displacement because he's redirecting his emotions into a different activity.\n\nBut wait, let's look at sublimation. I remember that sublimation is when uncomfortable feelings or impulses are channeled into something more productive or socially acceptable. For example, if someone has aggressive tendencies, they might become a surgeon where precision and control are needed, or an athlete who channels their energy into sports. So, in Max's case, his anger and frustration are being channeled into his artwork. That sounds a lot like sublimation because he's transforming his negative emotions into a creative outlet.\n\nLet me consider rationalization next. Rationalization is when someone justifies their behavior or feelings with logical reasons, even if those reasons aren't truly valid. For example, if someone doesn't get a job they wanted, they might say, \"Well, I didn't really want that job anyway,\" to make themselves feel better. In Max's situation, he's not trying to justify why Suzy chose Dylan or anything like that. He's just focusing on his artwork, so rationalization doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nLastly, there's repression. Repression is when unpleasant thoughts, feelings, or memories are pushed out of conscious awareness. It's like burying something deep inside so you don't have to deal with it. For example, if someone experiences a traumatic event and can't remember it because it's too painful, that's repression. In Max's case, he's not ignoring or forgetting his feelings; he's actively channeling them into his art. So, repression doesn't seem to apply here either.\n\nNow, between displacement and sublimation, there's a bit of overlap because both involve redirecting emotions. But I think there's a key difference. Displacement is more about redirecting emotions to a safer target, possibly without much control, while sublimation is about channeling those emotions into something constructive and socially acceptable.\n\nIn Max's situation, he's not just displacing his anger into random activities; he's specifically channeling it into his artwork, which is a creative and productive outlet. So, it seems like he's using sublimation to handle his upset feelings.\n\nLet me double-check this. If he was just displacing his anger, he might be doing things like working out excessively or lashing out at insignificant things. But he's not; he's focusing on his art, which is a positive expression of his emotions.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate defense mechanism that Max is using in this scenario is sublimation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. sublimation}} \\]"
