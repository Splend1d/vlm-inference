                    "text": "So I have this problem here about work done by a constant force on a moving particle. The force F is a constant unit force parallel to the vector (-1, 0, 1), and the particle moves along the path given by (t, t\u00b2, t\u00b3) between time t=0 and t=1. I need to find the work done by F on the particle during this motion.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what work is in the context of vector calculus. Work done by a force on a particle moving along a curve is given by the line integral of the force along the path. Mathematically, it's \u222b F \u00b7 dr, where F is the force vector and dr is the differential displacement vector along the path.\n\nSince F is a constant force, the work done can be simplified to F \u00b7 \u222b dr, where \u222b dr is the displacement vector from the starting point to the ending point.\n\nBut wait, this is only true if the force is constant, which it is in this case. So, yes, work W = F \u00b7 \u0394r, where \u0394r is the displacement vector from t=0 to t=1.\n\nFirst, let's find the displacement vector \u0394r.\n\nThe path is given by r(t) = (t, t\u00b2, t\u00b3).\n\nAt t=0: r(0) = (0, 0, 0)\n\nAt t=1: r(1) = (1, 1, 1)\n\nSo, \u0394r = r(1) - r(0) = (1 - 0, 1 - 0, 1 - 0) = (1, 1, 1)\n\nNext, I need the force vector F, which is a unit vector parallel to (-1, 0, 1).\n\nFirst, find the unit vector in the direction of (-1, 0, 1).\n\nTo find a unit vector in the direction of a given vector, I need to divide the vector by its magnitude.\n\nThe magnitude of (-1, 0, 1) is sqrt((-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(2)\n\nTherefore, the unit vector F is (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2))\n\nNow, compute the work W = F \u00b7 \u0394r\n\nW = (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)) \u00b7 (1, 1, 1)\n\nW = (-1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*1\n\nW = -1/sqrt(2) + 0 + 1/sqrt(2)\n\nW = 0\n\nSo, according to this calculation, the work done is zero.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. -1/4\n\nB. -1/(4sqrt(2))\n\nC. 0\n\nD. sqrt(2)\n\nMy answer matches with option C. 0\n\nBut wait a minute, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the path is r(t) = (t, t\u00b2, t\u00b3) from t=0 to t=1.\n\nAt t=0: (0, 0, 0)\n\nAt t=1: (1, 1, 1)\n\nSo, \u0394r = (1, 1, 1) - (0, 0, 0) = (1, 1, 1)\n\nForce F is a unit vector parallel to (-1, 0, 1)\n\nMagnitude of (-1, 0, 1) is sqrt(1 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(2), correct.\n\nUnit vector F = (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), correct.\n\nDot product F \u00b7 \u0394r = (-1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*1 = -1/sqrt(2) + 0 + 1/sqrt(2) = 0, correct.\n\nHmm, but maybe there's another way to look at it, perhaps by parameterizing the path and integrating the force along it.\n\nSince F is constant, the work done is indeed just F \u00b7 \u0394r, as I calculated.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up the integral \u222b F \u00b7 dr from t=0 to t=1.\n\nGiven r(t) = (t, t\u00b2, t\u00b3), dr = (1, 2t, 3t\u00b2) dt\n\nSo, W = \u222b from 0 to 1 F \u00b7 (1, 2t, 3t\u00b2) dt\n\nSince F is (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), the integral becomes:\n\nW = \u222b from 0 to 1 [(-1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*(2t) + (1/sqrt(2))*(3t\u00b2)] dt\n\nW = \u222b from 0 to 1 [ -1/sqrt(2) + 0 + 3t\u00b2/sqrt(2) ] dt\n\nW = \u222b from 0 to 1 [ (3t\u00b2 - 1)/sqrt(2) ] dt\n\nNow, integrate term by term:\n\n\u222b (3t\u00b2 - 1)/sqrt(2) dt = (1/sqrt(2)) \u222b (3t\u00b2 - 1) dt\n\n= (1/sqrt(2)) [ t\u00b3 - t ] from 0 to 1\n\n= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1\u00b3 - 1) - (0\u00b3 - 0) ]\n\n= (1/sqrt(2)) [ 0 - 0 ]\n\n= 0\n\nSo, the integral confirms the earlier result that W = 0.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 0\n\nBut let's see if there's any possibility of misinterpretation in the problem.\n\nThe problem says F is a constant unit force parallel to (-1, 0, 1).\n\nI assumed it was in the same direction as (-1, 0, 1), but maybe it's in the opposite direction.\n\nWait, \"parallel\" could mean in the same direction or the opposite direction.\n\nBut since it's a unit force, the direction is well-defined by the unit vector.\n\nSo, F = (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), as I calculated.\n\nAlternatively, if it were in the opposite direction, it would be (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nBut the problem specifies that F is parallel to (-1, 0, 1), so it should be in the same direction.\n\nAssuming that, the work done is still zero, as calculated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the path equation.\n\nThe path is given by (t, t\u00b2, t\u00b3).\n\nLet me verify the displacement vector.\n\nAt t=0: (0, 0, 0)\n\nAt t=1: (1, 1, 1)\n\nSo, \u0394r = (1, 1, 1), which seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the force is not correctly aligned.\n\nWait, maybe I need to parameterize the force in terms of t.\n\nBut since F is constant, it shouldn't change with t.\n\nTherefore, the work should indeed be F \u00b7 \u0394r.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the force is not aligned correctly with the path.\n\nBut no, the calculation seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 0\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
