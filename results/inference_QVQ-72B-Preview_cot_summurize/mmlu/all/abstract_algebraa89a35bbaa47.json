                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"Using Fermat's theorem, find the remainder of \\(3^{47}\\) when it is divided by 23.\" And the options are A. 1, B. 2, C. 3, D. 4. Alright, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that Fermat's Little Theorem is a useful tool in modular arithmetic, especially when dealing with exponents and prime numbers. The theorem states that if \\(p\\) is a prime number and \\(a\\) is an integer not divisible by \\(p\\), then \\(a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\\). In other words, \\(a^{p-1} - 1\\) is divisible by \\(p\\).\n\nIn this problem, \\(p = 23\\), which is a prime number, and \\(a = 3\\), which is not divisible by 23. So, according to Fermat's Little Theorem, \\(3^{22} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}\\).\n\nNow, I need to find \\(3^{47} \\pmod{23}\\). Since \\(3^{22} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}\\), maybe I can express \\(3^{47}\\) in terms of \\(3^{22}\\).\n\nLet's see: \\(47\\) divided by \\(22\\) is \\(2\\) with a remainder of \\(3\\), because \\(22 \\times 2 = 44\\), and \\(47 - 44 = 3\\). So, \\(3^{47} = 3^{22 \\times 2 + 3} = (3^{22})^2 \\times 3^3\\).\n\nFrom Fermat's Little Theorem, \\(3^{22} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}\\), so \\((3^{22})^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}\\). Therefore, \\(3^{47} \\equiv 1 \\times 3^3 \\equiv 3^3 \\pmod{23}\\).\n\nNow, I just need to compute \\(3^3 = 27\\), and find \\(27 \\pmod{23}\\). \\(27\\) divided by \\(23\\) is \\(1\\) with a remainder of \\(4\\), so \\(27 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{23}\\).\n\nTherefore, the remainder when \\(3^{47}\\) is divided by \\(23\\) is \\(4\\).\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the options: A. 1, B. 2, C. 3, D. 4. So, the answer should be D. 4.\n\nBut, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, confirming that 23 is a prime number \u2013 yes, it is. Next, verifying that \\(3^{22} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}\\) per Fermat's Little Theorem \u2013 that seems correct.\n\nThen, expressing 47 as \\(22 \\times 2 + 3\\) \u2013 that's right. And calculating \\(3^{47} = (3^{22})^2 \\times 3^3\\), and since \\(3^{22} \\equiv 1\\), then \\((3^{22})^2 \\equiv 1\\), so \\(3^{47} \\equiv 1 \\times 3^3 = 27\\).\n\nNow, \\(27 \\div 23 = 1\\) with a remainder of \\(4\\), so indeed, \\(27 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{23}\\).\n\nI think that's solid. Maybe just to be extra sure, I can consider calculating \\(3^{47} \\pmod{23}\\) using a different approach, like repeated squaring, to confirm the result.\n\nAlright, let's try that. Starting with \\(3^1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{23}\\).\n\nThen, \\(3^2 = 9\\), and \\(9 \\pmod{23} = 9\\).\n\nNext, \\(3^4 = (3^2)^2 = 9^2 = 81\\), and \\(81 \\div 23 = 3\\) with a remainder of \\(12\\), so \\(81 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{23}\\).\n\nThen, \\(3^8 = (3^4)^2 \\equiv 12^2 = 144 \\pmod{23}\\). \\(144 \\div 23 = 6\\) with a remainder of \\(6\\), so \\(144 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{23}\\).\n\nNext, \\(3^{16} = (3^8)^2 \\equiv 6^2 = 36 \\pmod{23}\\). \\(36 \\div 23 = 1\\) with a remainder of \\(13\\), so \\(36 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{23}\\).\n\nNow, to get \\(3^{47}\\), I can write \\(47\\) as \\(32 + 15\\), but that doesn't seem helpful. Wait, maybe binary exponentiation is a better way.\n\nLet's convert 47 to binary: \\(47_{10} = 101111_2\\), which is \\(32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 63_{10}\\), wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, no, \\(32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 63\\), but 47 is less than that. Let me try again.\n\nActually, \\(47_{10} = 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 57\\), still more than 47. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nLet me list the binary digits: 47 is 101111 in binary, which is \\(1 \\times 32 + 0 \\times 16 + 1 \\times 8 + 1 \\times 4 + 1 \\times 2 + 1 \\times 1 = 32 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 47\\). So, \\(47 = 32 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(3^{47} = 3^{32 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1} = 3^{32} \\times 3^{8} \\times 3^{4} \\times 3^{2} \\times 3^{1}\\).\n\nFrom earlier calculations:\n\n- \\(3^{1} \\equiv 3 \\pmod{23}\\)\n\n- \\(3^{2} \\equiv 9 \\pmod{23}\\)\n\n- \\(3^{4} \\equiv 12 \\pmod{23}\\)\n\n- \\(3^{8} \\equiv 6 \\pmod{23}\\)\n\n- \\(3^{16} \\equiv 13 \\pmod{23}\\)\n\n- \\(3^{32} = (3^{16})^2 \\equiv 13^2 = 169 \\pmod{23}\\). \\(169 \\div 23 = 7\\) with a remainder of \\(8\\), so \\(169 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{23}\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(3^{47} \\equiv 3 \\times 9 \\times 12 \\times 6 \\times 8 \\pmod{23}\\).\n\nLet's compute that step by step:\n\nFirst, \\(3 \\times 9 = 27 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{23}\\)\n\nThen, \\(4 \\times 12 = 48 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{23}\\) (since \\(48 - 2 \\times 23 = 48 - 46 = 2\\), but I think I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, \\(48 \\div 23 = 2\\) with a remainder of \\(2\\), so \\(48 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{23}\\).\n\nThen, \\(2 \\times 6 = 12 \\pmod{23}\\)\n\nFinally, \\(12 \\times 8 = 96 \\pmod{23}\\). \\(96 \\div 23 = 4\\) with a remainder of \\(4\\), so \\(96 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{23}\\).\n\nSo, this method also gives me \\(3^{47} \\equiv 4 \\pmod{23}\\), which confirms my earlier result.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can try another approach, like using Euler's theorem, but since 23 is prime, Fermat's Little Theorem is sufficient and more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I could compute \\(3^{47} \\pmod{23}\\) directly, but that would be impractical due to the large exponent. However, since I've already used two different methods and both lead to the same conclusion, I feel confident that the remainder is indeed 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
