                    "text": "Let's see here. The question is about the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the global defense trade. There are four options, and I need to pick the correct one based on the information provided.\n\nOption A says that NGOs are the primary actors in modern arms control measures. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. I thought that governments and international organizations like the United Nations play a big role in arms control. NGOs might be important, but are they the primary actors? Maybe not.\n\nOption B says that NGOs are unable to access the resources and information needed to develop effective policy or action on arms control. That seems a bit strong. I know that some NGOs are quite involved in advocacy and research related to arms control. They might not have the same resources as governments, but they can still be effective.\n\nOption C states that NGOs have played a significant and effective role in developing arms control measures in recent years. This sounds plausible. I recall that NGOs have been involved in campaigns against landmines and cluster munitions, which led to international treaties banning their use. So, they seem to have had an impact.\n\nOption D mentions that there is a serious lack of involvement by non-governmental actors in controlling the global defense trade. This contradicts what I know about NGOs' involvement in arms control issues. As I mentioned earlier, NGOs have been quite active in this area.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think Option C is the most accurate statement. NGOs have indeed played a significant role in developing arms control measures, as evidenced by their involvement in various successful campaigns and international treaties related to weapons.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about it again. Is there any chance that NGOs are the primary actors? No, I don't think so. Governments and international bodies still hold the main reins in arms control negotiations and implementations. So, Option A is probably incorrect.\n\nOption B seems to underestimate the capabilities and influence of NGOs. Many NGOs specialize in arms control and have access to expertise and networks that allow them to influence policy and public opinion. So, I don't think they're unable to access necessary resources and information.\n\nOption D suggests that there's a lack of NGO involvement, but as I said before, NGOs have been actively engaged in controlling the global defense trade. Their efforts might not be sufficient, but there is definitely involvement.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that Option C is the correct answer. Non-governmental groups have played a significant and effective role in developing arms control measures in recent years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
