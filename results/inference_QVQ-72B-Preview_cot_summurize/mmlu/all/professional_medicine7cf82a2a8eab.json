                    "text": "So I'm looking at this case about a 3-week-old baby with white lesions in the mouth that have been there for two days. The mom is bringing him in, and from what I can tell, the baby's been doing okay otherwise. He was born at term, had a normal delivery, and he's been breastfeeding well. He's also been peeing and pooping normally, which is good. His weight at birth was 3289 grams, which is around the 30th percentile, and now he's at 3629 kilograms\u2014that doesn't seem right. Wait, kilograms? That can't be. Let me check that again. At birth, he was 3289 g, which is 3.289 kg, and now he's at 3629 kg. That would mean he's gained over 3000 kg, which is impossible for a baby in three weeks. Maybe it's a typo, and it should be 3629 grams, which would be 3.629 kg. That makes more sense. So, if he was 3.289 kg at birth and now 3.629 kg, that's about a 0.34 kg increase in three weeks, which seems reasonable for a breastfeeding baby.\n\nAnyway, moving on. The vital signs are normal, and the baby appears well-hydrated. The main concern is these white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa. The doctor tried scraping them with a tongue blade, and they didn't come off. That's an important detail because sometimes, you get white patches that can be scraped off, like in thrush, which is caused by Candida albicans, or you might have something else that doesn't scrape off as easily.\n\nGiven that they didn't come off when scraped, it suggests that these lesions are more firmly attached to the mucosa. Now, in infants, one common cause of white oral lesions is thrush, which is a fungal infection caused by Candida. Thrush typically presents with white patches that can be scraped off, revealing a reddish underlying surface. But in this case, the patches didn't come off when scraped, which might make you think twice about whether it's thrush.\n\nHowever, sometimes, thrush lesions can be quite adherent, especially in infants, and might not scrape off easily. So, maybe it's still a possibility. Another consideration could be milk residue or something related to breastfeeding, but that seems less likely since it's been going on for two days and is causing concern.\n\nLet me think about other possible causes. Could it be a viral infection? Something like herpetic gingivostomatitis can cause ulcers and vesicles in the mouth, but that usually presents with painful lesions, and the baby seems to be doing well otherwise, without any signs of distress.\n\nHand, foot, and mouth disease is another viral infection that can cause oral lesions, but again, those are typically vesicular and might not present as white patches.\n\nBacterial infections are less common in the oral cavity of infants, but something like diphtheria comes to mind, which causes a grayish membrane in the throat, but that's more in older children and adults, and it's not typically something you'd see in a 3-week-old.\n\nSo, leaning back towards thrush, especially since it's common in infants, especially those who are breastfeeding, and it can present with white patches that may or may not scrape off easily.\n\nNow, the question is about pharmacotherapy. The options are acyclovir, fluconazole, nystatin, and valacyclovir.\n\nAcyclovir and valacyclovir are antiviral medications used primarily for herpesviruses. Since I'm considering thrush, which is fungal, these wouldn't be the first choice unless there's a specific indication for antivirals.\n\nFluconazole is an antifungal medication that's often used to treat thrush in infants. It's given orally and is generally well-tolerated.\n\nNystatin is another antifungal medication, commonly used in the form of oral suspension for treating thrush in infants. It works locally in the mouth and is less systemically absorbed.\n\nGiven that, both fluconazole and nystatin are appropriate choices for thrush. However, nystatin is topical and needs to be applied several times a day, while fluconazole is oral and once a week. But in infants, especially young ones, fluconazole might not be the first choice due to potential side effects, although it's generally safe.\n\nWait, actually, according to pediatric guidelines, fluconazole can be used for thrush in infants, but nystatin is often the first-line treatment because it has fewer side effects and is easy to administer.\n\nLet me double-check that. In infants, especially those who are breastfeeding, nystatin oral suspension is commonly prescribed. It's applied to the inside of the mouth several times a day. Fluconazole is also used, but typically for more severe or refractory cases, or in cases where compliance with nystatin is an issue.\n\nGiven that this is a young infant, and it's a straightforward case of suspected thrush, I would lean towards nystatin as the most appropriate first-line pharmacotherapy.\n\nSo, my answer would be C. Nystatin.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
