                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a coat with a list price of $325.00. In November, it didn't sell, so the merchant marked it down by 20%. Then, in December, there was another markdown of 10%. We need to find out what a Christmas shopper would pay for the coat in December.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"marked down\" means. I think it means that the price is reduced by a certain percentage. So, in November, the price was reduced by 20%, and then in December, it was reduced by an additional 10%.\n\nLet me start by calculating the price after the November markdown. If the original price is $325.00 and it's marked down by 20%, I need to find 20% of $325.00 and then subtract that from the original price.\n\nTo calculate 20% of $325.00:\n\n20% of $325.00 = (20/100) * $325.00 = 0.20 * $325.00 = $65.00\n\nSo, the markdown in November is $65.00. Therefore, the new price after the November markdown should be:\n\n$325.00 - $65.00 = $260.00\n\nNow, in December, there's an additional markdown of 10%. So, I need to find 10% of the new price ($260.00) and subtract that from $260.00 to get the final price.\n\n10% of $260.00 = (10/100) * $260.00 = 0.10 * $260.00 = $26.00\n\nSubtracting this from $260.00:\n\n$260.00 - $26.00 = $234.00\n\nSo, the final price should be $234.00.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the combined markdown. First, a 20% markdown in November, then an additional 10% markdown in December. But the 10% is off the already discounted price, not off the original price.\n\nI think I did it correctly by calculating each markdown sequentially based on the current price.\n\nLet me see if there's another approach, maybe using multipliers.\n\nFor November, a 20% markdown means the coat is sold at 80% of the original price.\n\nSo, $325.00 * 0.80 = $260.00\n\nThen, in December, a 10% markdown means it's sold at 90% of the November price.\n\nSo, $260.00 * 0.90 = $234.00\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nLet me check if maybe the 10% is off the original price or off the November discounted price.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"in December, she marked it down an additional 10 percent.\"\n\nI think this means an additional 10% off the price after the first markdown, not off the original price.\n\nSo, yes, applying the December markdown to the November price is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final price is $234.00.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $227.50\n\nB. $234.00\n\nC. $286.00\n\nD. $290.00\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. $234.00.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any errors in my calculations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{234.00} \\]"
