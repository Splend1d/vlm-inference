From what I recall, it's a type of argument that tries to persuade by relying on popular opinion or widespread beliefs rather than on facts or evidence. So, it's basically saying that something must be true or good because a lot of people think so.\n\nNow, let's look at each option to see which one matches this description.\n\nOption A: argument by consensus. This sounds like it's about agreeing with the majority view. In science and academia, consensus is important, but in everyday arguments, appealing to consensus without considering evidence can be a fallacy. So, this seems related.\n\nOption B: appeal to beliefs. This could be broad. We all have beliefs, and sometimes arguments are based on what people believe to be true. But this seems a bit too vague. Beliefs can be based on evidence or not, so not all appeals to beliefs are fallacious.\n\nOption C: no true Scotsman. This one I've heard before. It's when someone defines something in a way that excludes counterexamples. For example, saying \"no true Scotsman would ever eat haggis with anything but whisky sauce\" to avoid dealing with the fact that some Scots might eat it differently. This seems different from appealing to popular opinion.\n\nOption D: overlooked evidence. This sounds like it's about ignoring relevant information that doesn't support your argument. While this can be a mistake in reasoning, it's not specifically about appealing to the popularity of an idea.\n\nComparing all these, option A, argument by consensus, seems the closest to the concept of appealing to the people. It directly refers to basing an argument on the agreement or opinion of a group, which aligns with relying on popular opinion rather than factual evidence.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check. Appeal to the people, or ad populum in Latin, is indeed a type of fallacy where the argument's validity is based on the number of people who hold that view. Argument by consensus also suggests that the truth is determined by how many people agree with it, which is similar.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is A. argument by consensus.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
