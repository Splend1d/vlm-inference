                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about lithic technology in the Arctic. It mentions wedge-shaped cores, micro-blades, bifacial knives, and burins. And the options are Clovis Complex, Denali Complex, Folsom Complex, and Nenana Complex. I need to match the technology with the correct name.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these terms means. Lithic technology refers to the tools made from stone, especially those used by prehistoric peoples. The Arctic region has a rich history of such tools, adapted to the harsh environment.\n\nLet me break down the tools mentioned:\n\n1. Wedge-shaped cores: These are likely the starting point for making other tools. Cores are pieces of stone from which smaller flakes are struck to create tools like blades.\n\n2. Micro-blades: These are very small, thin blades, often used in composite tools or for detailed work.\n\n3. Bifacial knives: These are knives that have been worked on both sides to achieve a sharp edge, making them effective for cutting and slicing.\n\n4. Burins: These are tools with a pointed end, used for engraving or working hard materials like bone or antler.\n\nNow, I need to see which of these complexes is associated with this particular set of tools.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Clovis Complex: I recall that the Clovis Complex is a well-known early Paleo-Indian culture in North America, dated to around 13,000 years ago. They are famous for their distinctive Clovis points, which are fluted spear points. However, I don't remember if they specifically used wedge-shaped cores or micro-blades. Maybe they did use some similar technologies, but I'm not sure about the exact match.\n\nB. Denali Complex: This one sounds familiar. I think it's another Paleo-Indian culture, possibly older than Clovis. It might have been present in Alaska and northwestern Canada. I believe they used different types of tools, including some that resemble the ones listed here. But again, I need to confirm if they specifically used wedge-shaped cores and micro-blades.\n\nC. Folsom Complex: This is another Paleo-Indian culture, slightly younger than Clovis, dating to around 11,000 years ago. They are known for their Folsom points, which are similar to Clovis points but with some differences in design. Again, I'm not sure if they used micro-blades or burins extensively.\n\nD. Nenana Complex: This is another early Paleo-Indian culture, possibly contemporaneous with or preceding Clovis. It's named after the Nenana site in Alaska and is known for its distinctive tool kit. I think they used a variety of stone tools, including some that might match the description provided.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. All of these complexes seem to be related to early Paleo-Indian cultures in North America, particularly in the Arctic or sub-Arctic regions. They all used stone tools, but each had their own characteristics.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I should look at the specific tools mentioned and see which complex is known for using them.\n\nStarting with wedge-shaped cores: These are likely used to produce micro-blades. Micro-blades are small, thin blades that can be assembled into larger tools or used individually. They are a common feature in many Arctic and Subarctic tool kits, especially in more recent periods, but also in some Paleo-Indian cultures.\n\nBifacial knives: These are knives that have been worked on both sides to create a sharp edge. This is a pretty common technique in stone tool\u5236\u4f5c across many cultures, so it might not be specific to one complex.\n\nBurins: These are tools with a pointed end, often used for engraving or working hard materials. Again, these are found in various tool kits.\n\nSo, considering all this, I need to find which complex is particularly known for this combination of tools in the Arctic region.\n\nI think the Denali Complex is known for its advanced lithic technology, including the use of micro-blades and specialized core forms like wedge-shaped cores. It's also been dated to around 14,500 to 13,500 years ago, which makes it one of the earliest complexes in the region.\n\nThe Clovis Complex is slightly younger, around 13,000 years ago, and is more famous for its fluted points, which aren't specifically mentioned here.\n\nThe Folsom Complex, being even younger at around 11,000 years ago, also focuses on fluted points and may not fit the description as closely.\n\nThe Nenana Complex is another early complex, similar in age to Denali, and is known for its diverse tool kit, but I'm not sure if it includes wedge-shaped cores and micro-blades as prominently as the Denali Complex.\n\nTherefore, based on my knowledge, the Denali Complex seems to be the most fitting answer for the description provided.\n\nBut to make sure, let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something about one of the other complexes.\n\nFor example, the Nenana Complex is known for its early presence in Alaska and has been associated with a variety of tools, including some that could be considered micro-blades. However, I think the Denali Complex is better known for its micro-blade technology.\n\nThe Clovis Complex, while significant, is more associated with large game hunting and fluted points, which aren't directly mentioned in the tools list.\n\nThe Folsom Complex similarly focuses on fluted points and large game hunting, again not matching the specific tools listed.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is the Denali Complex.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. Denali Complex}} \\]"
