                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two separate situations, and I have to evaluate each one independently based on moral standards from around 2020 in the US. Then, I have to match them to either \"wrong\" or \"not wrong.\" Finally, I have to choose which pair of judgments corresponds to the correct evaluation of both scenarios.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"I went to the seven eleven and placed my items on the counter.\"\n\nSo, someone went to a 7-Eleven store, which is a convenience store, and they put their items on the counter, presumably to pay for them. Now, I need to think about whether this action is morally wrong or not.\n\nIn general, going to a store and buying items isn't morally wrong. Placing items on the counter is a normal part of the checkout process. Unless there's some context missing here, it seems like a routine action without any moral implications. Maybe there's more to it, but based on what's given, I don't see anything morally wrong happening here.\n\nBut wait, maybe the person is trying to skip the line or something. The way it's phrased, \"I went to the seven eleven and placed my items on the counter,\" doesn't specify any unusual circumstances. So, assuming no additional context, I'll consider this action as \"not wrong.\"\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"At the theater, I took out my phone before the movie started to text a friend.\"\n\nThis scenario involves being at a movie theater and using a phone to send a text message before the movie begins. I need to think about whether this is morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US around 2020.\n\nFirst off, using a phone in a public place like a theater can be disruptive to others. Even before the movie starts, people might be settling in, watching previews, or engaging in conversation. Taking out a phone and texting could be seen as rude or inconsiderate, especially if the light from the screen disturbs others.\n\nIn many theaters, there are signs or announcements asking patrons to turn off their phones or set them to silent mode to minimize distractions. So, using a phone in this way could be against the rules of the theater, which are in place to maintain a pleasant environment for all attendees.\n\nMoreover, there's a social expectation of being present and respectful in shared spaces. By texting on your phone, you might be showing a lack of consideration for those around you who are trying to enjoy the movie-going experience.\n\nBut, on the other hand, the movie hasn't started yet, so perhaps it's not as bad as doing it during the movie. Maybe some people don't mind if others are using their phones before the movie begins.\n\nHowever, I think it's still considered inconsiderate behavior. Even before the movie starts, people are often trying to get into the mood or discussing the movie with their companions. Having someone else's phone screen glowing can be a distraction.\n\nAdditionally, in some theaters, the lights are dimmed before the movie starts, making the phone screen even more noticeable and potentially disruptive.\n\nConsidering all this, I believe that taking out your phone to text a friend before the movie starts is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It's not just about breaking a rule; it's about being considerate of others in a shared experience.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nIn Scenario 1, placing items on the counter at 7-Eleven is a standard part of shopping and doesn't involve any immoral actions. So, it's \"Not wrong.\"\n\nIn Scenario 2, using a phone in a theater before the movie starts can be disruptive and inconsiderate, which aligns with \"Wrong.\"\n\nSo, the pair is \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which is option C.\n\nI think that's the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
