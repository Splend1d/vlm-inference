                    "text": "So I've got this matrix A, and I need to find the dimensionality of its null space. The matrix is:\n\nA = [[3, 2, -9], [-6, -4, 18], [12, 8, -36]]\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember what the null space is. The null space of a matrix is the set of all vectors that, when multiplied by the matrix, give the zero vector. So, for matrix A, it's the set of all vectors X such that AX = 0.\n\nThe dimension of the null space is also known as the nullity of the matrix. I recall that there's a relationship between the rank of the matrix and its nullity, which is called the rank-nullity theorem. It states that for any m x n matrix, rank(A) + nullity(A) = n.\n\nSo, if I can find the rank of matrix A, I can find the nullity by subtracting the rank from the number of columns.\n\nAlright, let's find the rank of A. The rank is the number of linearly independent rows or columns.\n\nFirst, I'll check if the rows are linearly independent.\n\nThe first row is [3, 2, -9]\n\nThe second row is [-6, -4, 18]\n\nThe third row is [12, 8, -36]\n\nHmm, let's see if one of these rows can be expressed as a linear combination of the others.\n\nI notice that the second row is (-2) times the first row:\n\n[-6] = (-2) * [3\n\n-4] = (-2) * [2\n\n18] = (-2) * [-9]\n\nSimilarly, the third row is (4) times the first row:\n\n[12] = (4) * [3\n\n8] = (4) * [2\n\n-36] = (4) * [-9]\n\nSo, all three rows are scalar multiples of the first row. That means they are linearly dependent, and the rank of the matrix is 1.\n\nWait, but is there only one linearly independent row?\n\nLet me confirm by checking the columns.\n\nThe first column is [3, -6, 12], which is [3, -6, 12]\n\nThe second column is [2, -4, 8], which is [2, -4, 8]\n\nThe third column is [-9, 18, -36], which is [-9, 18, -36]\n\nAgain, I can see that the second column is (-2) times the first column:\n\n[2] = (-2) * [3\n\n-4] = (-2) * [-6\n\n8] = (-2) * [12]\n\nAnd the third column is (-3) times the first column:\n\n[-9] = (-3) * [3\n\n18] = (-3) * [-6\n\n-36] = (-3) * [12]\n\nSo, all three columns are scalar multiples of the first column, meaning they are linearly dependent.\n\nTherefore, the rank of the matrix is 1.\n\nNow, applying the rank-nullity theorem: rank(A) + nullity(A) = n\n\nHere, n is the number of columns, which is 3.\n\nSo, 1 + nullity(A) = 3\n\nTherefore, nullity(A) = 3 - 1 = 2\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option B is 1, which would be incorrect based on this calculation.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the rank is 1.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nMatrix A is:\n\nA = [[3, 2, -9], [-6, -4, 18], [12, 8, -36]]\n\nI saw that the second row is (-2) times the first row, and the third row is (4) times the first row.\n\nSimilarly, the columns are also scalar multiples of each other.\n\nSo, indeed, the rows are all linearly dependent, and the columns are all linearly dependent.\n\nTherefore, the rank is 1, and nullity is 2.\n\nBut the answer options are:\n\nA. 0\n\nB. 1\n\nC. 2\n\nD. 3\n\nSo, according to my calculation, the answer should be C. 2.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to row reduce the matrix to echelon form and see how many pivot columns there are.\n\nLet's attempt row reduction.\n\nStarting matrix:\n\n[ 3  2  -9 ]\n\n[-6 -4   18]\n\n[12  8  -36]\n\nFirst, I can swap row 1 and row 2 to make the first pivot easier.\n\n[ -6  -4   18 ]\n\n[  3   2   -9 ]\n\n[ 12   8  -36 ]\n\nNow, express row 2 in terms of row 1.\n\nRow 2 is currently [3, 2, -9]\n\nRow 1 is [-6, -4, 18]\n\nRow 2 can be obtained by multiplying row 1 by -0.5:\n\n[-6]*(-0.5) = [3\n\n-4]*(-0.5) = [2\n\n18]*(-0.5) = [-9]\n\nSo, row 2 is just row 1 multiplied by -0.5.\n\nSimilarly, row 3 is [12, 8, -36]\n\nRow 3 is row 1 multiplied by -2:\n\n[-6]*(-2) = [12\n\n-4]*(-2) = [8\n\n18]*(-2) = [-36]\n\nSo, all three rows are scalar multiples of each other.\n\nTherefore, in row echelon form, only one row will be non-zero.\n\nThus, rank is 1, and nullity is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 2.\n\nBut why is there an option D. 3? Maybe to test if I mistakenly think the matrix has full nullity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to find the nullity.\n\nLet me try solving AX = 0 directly.\n\nMatrix A is:\n\nA = [[3, 2, -9], [-6, -4, 18], [12, 8, -36]]\n\nSo, the system of equations is:\n\n3x + 2y - 9z = 0\n\n-6x - 4y + 18z = 0\n\n12x + 8y - 36z = 0\n\nBut since we've already established that all rows are multiples of each other, these equations are dependent, and we can reduce them.\n\nFrom the first equation: 3x + 2y - 9z = 0\n\nWe can solve for one variable in terms of the others.\n\nLet's solve for y:\n\n2y = -3x + 9z\n\ny = (-3/2)x + (9/2)z\n\nSo, y is expressed in terms of x and z.\n\nThis suggests that the null space is two-dimensional, since we have two free variables (x and z).\n\nTherefore, the nullity is 2.\n\nAlternatively, if I parameterize the solution, let's set z = s and x = t, where s and t are parameters.\n\nFrom y = (-3/2)x + (9/2)z\n\nSo, y = (-3/2)t + (9/2)s\n\nThen, a general solution in vector form would be:\n\nX = [x, y, z] = [t, (-3/2)t + (9/2)s, s]\n\n= t*[1, -3/2, 0] + s*[0, 9/2, 1]\n\nThis shows that the null space is spanned by two linearly independent vectors, confirming that the nullity is 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 2.\n\nI think this is solid. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of a different answer.\n\nSuppose I consider the determinant of the matrix. If the determinant is zero, the matrix is singular, and the null space is non-trivial.\n\nBut for a non-square matrix, like this 3x3 matrix, if the determinant is zero, it means the matrix doesn't have full rank.\n\nHowever, since it's a square matrix, and we've determined its rank is 1, the determinant should be zero, confirming that it's not full rank.\n\nBut in this case, it's a 3x3 matrix with rank 1, so determinant is zero, which aligns with our earlier conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the eigenvalues, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nNo, I think the approach using rank-nullity theorem is sufficient and straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
