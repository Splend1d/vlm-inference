                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that \\(f(x)\\) is an invertible function, and that \\(f(2) = f^{-1}(2) = 4\\). I need to find the value of \\(f(f(2))\\). Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I know that \\(f(x)\\) is invertible, which means it has an inverse function \\(f^{-1}(x)\\). The properties of inverse functions tell me that \\(f(f^{-1}(x)) = x\\) and \\(f^{-1}(f(x)) = x\\). That makes sense.\n\nGiven that \\(f(2) = 4\\), I can plug that into the inverse property. So, \\(f^{-1}(f(2)) = f^{-1}(4)\\). But since \\(f(2) = 4\\), then \\(f^{-1}(4) = 2\\). Wait, but it's already given that \\(f^{-1}(2) = 4\\), but here I'm finding \\(f^{-1}(4)\\). So, \\(f^{-1}(4) = 2\\). That seems consistent because if \\(f(2) = 4\\), then swapping them for the inverse function gives \\(f^{-1}(4) = 2\\). So that checks out.\n\nNow, I need to find \\(f(f(2))\\). I know that \\(f(2) = 4\\), so \\(f(f(2)) = f(4)\\). But I don't know what \\(f(4)\\) is directly. Hmm.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can use the given \\(f^{-1}(2) = 4\\) to find more information. So, \\(f^{-1}(2) = 4\\) implies that \\(f(4) = 2\\), because the inverse function swaps the inputs and outputs.\n\nSo, if \\(f(4) = 2\\), then going back to \\(f(f(2)) = f(4) = 2\\). That seems straightforward.\n\nLet me double-check this reasoning.\n\nWe have:\n\n1. \\(f(2) = 4\\)\n\n2. \\(f^{-1}(2) = 4\\), which implies \\(f(4) = 2\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(f(f(2)) = f(4) = 2\\).\n\nThat seems logical. But let me see if there's another way to look at it to confirm.\n\nConsidering the properties of invertible functions, I know that the function and its inverse are bijections, meaning they are both one-to-one and onto.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the composition of the functions. Since \\(f\\) and \\(f^{-1}\\) are inverses, their compositions cancel each other.\n\nBut in this problem, I'm dealing with \\(f(f(2))\\), which is \\(f(4)\\), and as I deduced earlier, \\(f(4) = 2\\).\n\nWait, but the problem also gave \\(f^{-1}(2) = 4\\), which again confirms that \\(f(4) = 2\\).\n\nI think I'm reinforcing the same conclusion repeatedly. Maybe I should consider if there's any trick or additional complexity here.\n\nIs there any possibility of multiple values or something like that? Well, the problem states that \\(f(x)\\) is invertible, so it must be one-to-one, meaning each input corresponds to exactly one output, and each output corresponds to exactly one input via the inverse.\n\nTherefore, no, there shouldn't be any ambiguity.\n\nLet me try to visualize this with a table of values.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\( x \\) | \\( f(x) \\)\n\n-------|--------\n\n2 | 4\n\nAnd since \\( f^{-1}(2) = 4 \\), that means:\n\n\\( x \\) | \\( f^{-1}(x) \\)\n\n--------|---------\n\n2 | 4\n\nFrom this, \\( f(4) = 2 \\), because \\( f^{-1}(2) = 4 \\) implies \\( f(4) = 2 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( f(f(2)) = f(4) = 2 \\).\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all possible angles here, and each time I end up with the same answer: \\( f(f(2)) = 2 \\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1\n\nB. 2\n\nC. 4\n\nD. 0\n\nSo, the correct choice should be B. 2.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other information I could use or if perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nSuppose I try to find another pair of values. For example, if \\( f(2) = 4 \\), and \\( f^{-1}(2) = 4 \\), maybe I can find another value for \\( f(x) \\).\n\nLet me think: since \\( f^{-1}(2) = 4 \\), and \\( f(4) = 2 \\), that's consistent.\n\nWhat about \\( f^{-1}(4) \\)? Well, since \\( f(2) = 4 \\), then \\( f^{-1}(4) = 2 \\).\n\nBut I don't need that for this particular calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the composition \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \\).\n\nPlugging in \\( x = 2 \\), I get \\( f(f^{-1}(2)) = 2 \\), which simplifies to \\( f(4) = 2 \\), again confirming my earlier finding.\n\nOkay, I think that's pretty much it. I can't see any flaw in this reasoning, and multiple approaches lead me to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\( 2 \\), which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
