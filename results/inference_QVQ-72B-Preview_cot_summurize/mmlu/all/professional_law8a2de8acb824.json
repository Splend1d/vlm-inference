                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have an employee who's been working at a hotel as a window cleaner for eight years. The hotel gives him and other employees a certificate that says, \"In appreciation of the faithful service hitherto rendered by you as an employee of this hotel, there will be paid in the event of your death, if still an employee of this hotel, to the party designated by you below as your beneficiary, the sum of $5,000. The issuance of this certificate is understood to be purely gratuitous.\"\n\nThe employee designates his wife as the beneficiary, signs it, and sends it back to the hotel. Then, one year later, while still working at the hotel, he passes away. His widow sues the hotel to get the $5,000. The question is, among the options provided, which one is the strongest argument against enforcing this certificate agreement?\n\nOkay, let's look at each option:\n\nA. The widow was unaware of the certificate agreement until after the employee died.\n\nSo, does it matter if the widow knew about it or not? Well, she's the beneficiary, and she was designated by her husband. But in terms of the agreement between the employee and the hotel, does her knowledge play a role? Hmm, probably not directly. The agreement seems to be between the employee and the hotel. So, maybe this isn't the strongest argument.\n\nB. There was no privity of contract between the widow and the hotel.\n\nPrivity of contract means there's a direct contractual relationship between two parties. Here, the contract is between the employee and the hotel. The widow is a third party, even though she's the designated beneficiary. So, maybe the hotel can argue that since she wasn't a party to the contract, she can't enforce it. But wait, in many jurisdictions, beneficiaries under insurance policies or similar arrangements can enforce the contract because they're intended third-party beneficiaries. So, maybe this isn't a slam-dunk argument either.\n\nC. The widow in no way relied on the hotel's promise to pay the $5,000.\n\nAgain, similar to option A, her reliance might not be directly relevant because her status as a beneficiary is based on the agreement between her husband and the hotel. If the hotel promised to pay $5,000 upon his death, and he designated her as the beneficiary, her reliance on that promise might not be necessary for enforcement. Maybe not the strongest argument.\n\nD. There was insufficient consideration to support the certificate agreement.\n\nNow, consideration is a big deal in contract law. For a contract to be enforceable, there must be consideration from both parties. Consideration is something of value exchanged between the parties, which makes the promise enforceable.\n\nLet's see: The hotel is promising to pay $5,000 upon the employee's death, provided he's still employed there. What are they getting in return? The employee designated his wife as the beneficiary and signed the certificate. Is that sufficient consideration?\n\nWell, designating a beneficiary and signing the certificate might not be seen as substantial consideration. Maybe the employee's continued employment could be considered consideration, but the certificate says the payment is only if he's still employed at the time of death.\n\nWait, but the employee had already been working there for eight years when he received the certificate. So, perhaps his past service could be considered consideration for the certificate, but the certificate mentions that it's in appreciation of the faithful service hitherto rendered. So, maybe his past service was the consideration for the certificate.\n\nBut, if that's the case, then the consideration has already been provided before the promise was made. In some cases, past consideration isn't sufficient for a new promise. Maybe the hotel can argue that since the employee's past service was already compensated, there's no new consideration for this additional promise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the employee's continued employment can be seen as consideration for the hotel's promise. But, if the employee is already obligated to continue working unless he quits, is continued employment sufficient consideration for the additional promise of the $5,000?\n\nThis seems a bit tricky. Maybe the hotel can argue that there's insufficient consideration because the employee didn't provide anything new or additional in exchange for the $5,000 promise.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose the hotel said, \"In recognition of your eight years of service, we will give you $5,000 upon your death if you're still employed here, and you need to designate a beneficiary.\" Here, the past service might be the consideration for the promise, but as I recall, past consideration is generally not considered valid consideration for a new promise.\n\nHowever, there's a concept called \"executed consideration,\" where the consideration has already been provided before the promise is made. In some cases, especially if the consideration was at the request of the promisor or was part of a pre-existing duty, it might be sufficient.\n\nBut, generally, past acts are not good consideration for new promises. So, if the employee's past service was already compensated, promising $5,000 based on that past service might lack consideration.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the employee's agreement to designate a beneficiary and perhaps his continued employment could be seen as consideration. But if his continued employment is something he's already contractually obligated to do (unless he chooses to quit), it's unclear if that counts as new consideration.\n\nThis seems like a strong argument for the hotel. If they can show that there was insufficient consideration to support the certificate agreement, then the agreement might not be enforceable.\n\nComparing this to the other options:\n\n- Option A: Widow's unawareness \u2013 probably not relevant.\n\n- Option B: No privity of contract \u2013 Beneficiaries can often enforce such promises.\n\n- Option C: Widow didn't rely on the promise \u2013 Again, probably not relevant to the enforceability of the agreement between the employee and the hotel.\n\nOption D seems to be the most solid legal argument against enforcing the certificate agreement.\n\nBut wait, let's consider if there's any other angle here. Maybe the certificate is a gratuity, as it says \"purely gratuitous,\" which might imply that it's a gift rather than a contractual promise. Gifts are generally not enforceable contracts unless there's consideration.\n\nSo, combining that with the consideration issue, it reinforces the idea that the certificate might not be enforceable due to lack of consideration.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the certificate is part of an employee benefit plan or something similar, and there are other legal doctrines that apply to such plans, but that might be beyond the scope here.\n\nGiven the options, I think D is the strongest argument against enforcement of the certificate agreement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
