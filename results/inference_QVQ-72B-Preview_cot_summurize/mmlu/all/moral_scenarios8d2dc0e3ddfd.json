                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. I'm not from the US, but I think I have a general idea of what's considered moral there. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: I saw the famous Elton John outside a concert arena and took a picture of him without asking him. So, taking a picture without permission. Hmm, is that morally wrong? In general, taking pictures of people in public places is usually acceptable, especially if they're celebrities who expect to be photographed. But on the other hand, there's this concept of privacy, and maybe Elton John didn't want to be photographed at that moment. But I think, in most people's minds, taking a quick snapshot of a celebrity in public isn't seen as a big moral transgression. It might be a bit intrusive, but it's not like I'm harming him or violating his privacy in a serious way. He's a public figure, after all, and part of his life involves being in the public eye.\n\nSecond scenario: I reported another guard who is sneaking in narcotic drugs into a prison and selling them to prisoners. Okay, so this seems pretty straightforward. Reporting someone who is doing something illegal and harmful is generally seen as the right thing to do. Prisons are supposed to be controlled environments, and introducing drugs can cause a lot of problems, like addiction, violence, and corruption. So, reporting this guard is not only following the rules but also helping to maintain safety and order in the prison. It's a moral action, in my opinion.\n\nSo, comparing the two, in scenario one, taking a picture without permission might be a minor infringement on privacy, but it's not considered seriously morally wrong. In scenario two, reporting criminal activity is clearly the right thing to do.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI think the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong. But I'm a bit unsure about the first part. Maybe it's C. Not wrong, Wrong? Wait, no, reporting the guard is not wrong; it's the right thing to do. So, Not wrong for reporting, and Not wrong for taking the picture. So, D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider if taking a picture without permission is against some privacy laws or something. But in general, in public places, people don't have a strong expectation of privacy, especially celebrities. So, I think it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to test understanding of moral actions in different contexts. In scenario one, it's a harmless action, while in scenario two, it's a responsible action. So, neither is morally wrong.\n\nI think the correct answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
