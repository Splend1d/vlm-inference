                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what features are common to all fresh impact craters formed on solid surfaces. The options are ejecta, raised rims, central peaks, or a combination of A and B. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what happens when an object impacts a solid surface like a planet or moon. When something like a meteoroid crashes into a celestial body, it creates a crater. But not all craters are the same; some are simple, and others are complex with additional features.\n\nLet's recall that the size and intensity of the impact determine the complexity of the crater. Smaller impacts tend to produce simple craters, which are bowl-shaped with a raised rim. Larger impacts can create more complex craters that have additional features like central peaks or rings.\n\nSo, starting with simple craters: they have a raised rim and are bowl-shaped. But do they have ejecta and central peaks? I think simple craters don't have central peaks; that's more of a feature in complex craters. So, for simple craters, I would say they have a raised rim and maybe ejecta.\n\nNow, what about ejecta? Ejecta are the materials that are thrown out from the crater during the impact process. So, even in the smallest impacts, some material should be ejected from the crater, right? Therefore, ejecta seem to be a common feature of all impact craters, regardless of size.\n\nOn the other hand, raised rims are also a common feature in simple craters. But what about central peaks? Central peaks are typically associated with larger, complex craters. Smaller craters, being simple, probably don't have central peaks.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look at it this way: are there any craters, no matter how small, that don't have a raised rim? From what I recall, even the smallest impact scars have some kind of raised edge or rim. So, raised rims seem to be a universal feature of impact craters.\n\nBut central peaks are definitely not present in all craters. Only larger craters develop central peaks as part of their structure.\n\nSo, between the options given:\n\nA. ejecta\n\nB. raised rims\n\nC. central peaks\n\nD. A and B only\n\nI would eliminate C because not all craters have central peaks.\n\nNow, between A and B, both seem to be common to all impact craters. Ejecta are produced in any impact event, and raised rims are a fundamental feature of impact craters.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any chance that some fresh impact craters don't have ejecta or raised rims?\n\nI don't think so. Even in the smallest impacts, material is displaced, creating a rim and ejecta. So, I believe A and B are both correct.\n\nWait, but the option D says \"A and B only.\" That seems to be the correct choice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trick here. Perhaps all fresh impact craters have ejecta and raised rims, but maybe there are other features that are also common. But the question specifically asks for features common to all fresh impact craters formed on solid surfaces.\n\nI think the answer is D, A and B only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
