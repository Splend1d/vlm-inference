                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a grocery store that bought a big mirror, and they hired a carpenter to hang it. The mirror fell because of a defect in the brackets, and it hit a shopper, causing serious injuries. Now, the shopper wants to sue the carpenter based on strict liability in tort. I need to figure out whether the plaintiff will prevail in this claim.\n\nFirst, I should understand what strict liability in tort means. Strict liability is when someone is held responsible for damages or injuries caused by their actions, even if they weren't negligent or didn't intend for the harm to occur. In tort law, strict liability can apply to certain activities that are inherently dangerous or to defects in products.\n\nIn this case, the carpenter was hired to install the mirror using brackets and bolts provided by the manufacturer. The brackets had a defect, which caused the mirror to fall and injure the shopper. So, the question is whether the carpenter can be held strictly liable for this incident.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Prevail, because the brackets were defective when installed.\n\nB. Prevail, because it would be abnormally dangerous to maintain such a large mirror on the wall of a retail outlet.\n\nC. Not prevail, because the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.\n\nD. Not prevail, because the carpenter had no relationship of privily with the plaintiff.\n\nOkay, let's analyze each one.\n\nStarting with option A: Prevail, because the brackets were defective when installed.\n\nWell, the brackets were defective, but does that automatically mean the carpenter is strictly liable? The carpenter was hired to install the mirror, and he used the provided brackets. If the brackets were defective, and that defect caused the mirror to fall, it might not be the carpenter's fault directly. He was just following the manufacturer's instructions. So, maybe strict liability doesn't apply here because the carpenter wasn't responsible for the defect in the brackets.\n\nMoving on to option B: Prevail, because maintaining a large mirror on the wall of a retail outlet is abnormally dangerous.\n\nHmm, abnormally dangerous activities typically involve activities that are inherently risky, like blasting with explosives or keeping wild animals. Hanging a large mirror in a grocery store might be unusual, but is it abnormally dangerous? I don't think so. It's not like it's common knowledge that large mirrors are prone to falling and injuring people. So, I doubt that this activity qualifies as abnormally dangerous, which means strict liability based on that ground is unlikely.\n\nNow, option C: Not prevail, because the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.\n\nStrict liability in tort often applies to manufacturers or sellers of products who put defective products into the stream of commerce. Here, the carpenter was not selling the mirror; he was providing a service\u2014installing the mirror. So, if strict liability is being considered based on a defective product, it would more likely apply to the manufacturer of the brackets, not the carpenter. Therefore, the plaintiff might not prevail against the carpenter on this ground.\n\nLastly, option D: Not prevail, because the carpenter had no relationship of privily with the plaintiff.\n\nI'm not sure about the term \"privily.\" I think it might be a typo, and it should be \"privity.\" Privity usually refers to a direct relationship between two parties, often in contract law. In tort law, privity isn't as relevant because tort claims can be brought by anyone who suffers harm, regardless of a direct relationship with the defendant.\n\nBut in this case, since the carpenter was hired by the grocery store and the plaintiff is a shopper who was injured, there's no direct contractual relationship between them. However, in tort law, especially strict liability, privity isn't required. So, the lack of a direct relationship shouldn't bar the plaintiff from suing the carpenter in tort.\n\nGiven all this, I think the correct answer is option C: Not prevail, because the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n- Option A suggests that the defect in the brackets automatically makes the carpenter strictly liable, but that doesn't seem right because the carpenter didn't cause the defect; he just used the provided brackets.\n\n- Option B tries to classify hanging a large mirror as an abnormally dangerous activity, which doesn't seem to fit the typical understanding of abnormally dangerous activities.\n\n- Option D mentions privity, which isn't a barrier in tort law, especially in strict liability claims.\n\n- Option C points out that the carpenter wasn't involved in selling the mirror, which is relevant because strict liability in tort is usually imposed on manufacturers or sellers of defective products, not on service providers like carpenters who install them.\n\nTherefore, the plaintiff is unlikely to prevail against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort because the carpenter was providing a service, not selling a product, and wasn't responsible for the defect in the brackets.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the plaintiff might have other claims against the carpenter, such as negligence if the carpenter installed the mirror incorrectly or didn't check the brackets for defects, but based on the information given, it seems like the carpenter followed the manufacturer's instructions and used the provided brackets and bolts.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the plaintiff will not prevail based on strict liability in tort against the carpenter because the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
