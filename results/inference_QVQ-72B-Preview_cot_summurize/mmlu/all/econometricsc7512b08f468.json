                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about R-squared being zero in a regression model, and I need to figure out which statements are true. I'm not super confident with regression yet, so I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, what does R-squared represent? I remember that R-squared, or the coefficient of determination, measures how well the regression line fits the data. It's basically the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (y) that's explained by the independent variables (x's). So, if R-squared is zero, that means the model doesn't explain any of the variability of y around its mean. That sounds like statement iii) is true.\n\nNow, for statement i), it says that all coefficient estimates on the slopes will be zero. Hmm, if R-squared is zero, does that necessarily mean that the slope coefficients are zero? I think that in a simple linear regression, if the slope coefficient is zero, R-squared would be zero because there's no relationship between x and y. But in multiple regression, could some slope coefficients be non-zero even if R-squared is zero? I'm a bit confused here.\n\nLet me think about statement ii). It says the fitted line will be horizontal with respect to all of the explanatory variables. If the slope coefficients are zero, then yes, the line would be horizontal for each variable. But again, in multiple regression, could there be interactions or other variables that affect this? I need to be careful here.\n\nStatement iv) says that the intercept coefficient estimate must be zero. Does R-squared being zero imply anything about the intercept? I don't think so. The intercept is just the expected value of y when all x's are zero. Even if there's no relationship between x's and y (i.e., R-squared is zero), the intercept could still be any value, right?\n\nWait, maybe I should look at an extreme case to understand this better. Suppose I have a dataset where y is completely random, and none of the x's have any relationship with y. In that case, the regression model wouldn't explain any variance, so R-squared would be zero. The slope coefficients should all be zero, and the intercept would be the mean of y. So, statement i) would be true, but statement iv) wouldn't necessarily be true unless the mean of y is zero.\n\nThat makes sense. So, for statement i), if R-squared is zero, in a simple or multiple regression, the slope coefficients should all be zero because they don't explain any variance in y. For statement ii), if the slopes are zero, the lines are horizontal for each variable. So, both i) and ii) seem true.\n\nBut wait, in multiple regression, could there be cases where R-squared is zero but some slope coefficients are not zero? I think not, because if some slopes are non-zero, they should explain some variance, which would make R-squared positive. So, probably, if R-squared is zero, all slope coefficients are zero.\n\nStatement iii) seems straightforward. If R-squared is zero, the model hasn't explained any of the variability of y about its mean value. That aligns with the definition of R-squared.\n\nStatement iv) is about the intercept being zero. As I thought earlier, the intercept is just the expected value of y when all x's are zero. Even if R-squared is zero, the intercept could be any value depending on the data. So, this statement is false.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, statements i), ii), and iii) are true, while iv) is false.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. (ii) and (iv) only\n\nB. (i) and (iii) only\n\nC. (i), (ii), and (iii) only\n\nD. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\n\nI think the correct answer is C. (i), (ii), and (iii) only.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider a simple example. Suppose I have a dataset with y and x, and there's no relationship between them. The regression would yield a slope coefficient of zero, and the line would be horizontal (i.e., y doesn't change with x). The intercept would be the mean of y, which could be any value, not necessarily zero. So, statement iv) is indeed false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. (i), (ii), and (iii) only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
