The options are A, B, C, and D, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me read them again to make sure I understand.\n\nOption A says that women didn't actively engage in warfare as combatants, so questions about gender or their role weren't important in security considerations.\n\nOption B says that the roles women played in violence, whether as victims, perpetrators, or otherwise, were framed in terms of how they affected the state, rather than focusing on them as individuals or as women.\n\nOption C says that the role of women was given appropriate consideration; they've filled many vital roles in supporting the dominant security system.\n\nOption D says that women are generally unsupportive of warfare and prefer to be in anti-war or opposition movements, making their contribution to the study of warfare marginal.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about which of these reasons best explains why the role of women in war wasn't a major concern in security studies before the late 20th century.\n\nFirst, let's consider Option A. It claims that women didn't actively engage in warfare as combatants, so their gender roles weren't seen as important in security studies. Hmm, that seems plausible at first glance because traditionally, warfare has been dominated by men, especially in combat roles. But I remember learning that women have always played some roles in warfare, not just as nurses or support staff, but sometimes even as fighters. So, is it entirely accurate to say they didn't actively engage in warfare?\n\nLet me think about history. In ancient times, there were female warriors like the Amazons in Greek mythology, though that's more legend than fact. But there are real historical examples too, like Joan of Arc in the 15th century, who led armies in battle. And during World War II, there were female combatants in various resistance movements. So, it's not like women never fought in wars; it's just that their participation might have been less common or perhaps not as widely recognized or documented as that of men.\n\nMaybe the key point in Option A is that because women weren't the primary combatants, their roles weren't seen as crucial to security studies, which were mostly concerned with military strategy and combat operations. That could make sense. But I'm a bit unsure because security studies also deal with other aspects like intelligence, logistics, and home front support, where women have had significant roles.\n\nMoving on to Option B: it says that women's roles in violence were framed in terms of their impact on the state, rather than on them as individuals or as women. This seems interesting. Maybe in the past, when women were harmed in war, like in cases of rape or other violence, it was seen more as a failure of state protection or as a way to demoralize the enemy population, rather than as an issue of gender-specific violence.\n\nSimilarly, if women were perpetrators of violence, perhaps their actions were attributed to exceptional circumstances rather than being seen as part of a larger pattern related to their gender. This option suggests that the focus was on the state and its security, rather than on individual experiences or gender dynamics.\n\nOption C claims that the role of women was already given appropriate consideration because they filled vital support roles in the security system. This seems a bit contradictory. If their roles were considered vital, why weren't they a focus in security studies? Shouldn't important roles be studied?\n\nMaybe the idea is that since women were seen as supporting the existing security system, their roles weren't problematized or seen as needing special attention in academic or policy circles. But that feels a bit like overlooking their contributions or the unique challenges they faced in those roles.\n\nLastly, Option D suggests that women are generally unsupportive of warfare and prefer to be in anti-war movements, making their role in warfare studies marginal. This seems like a broad generalization. While it's true that many women have been involved in peace movements, there are also many examples of women supporting wars, whether as soldiers, nurses, factory workers, or in other capacities.\n\nFor instance, during World Wars I and II, women in many countries actively supported the war effort, both on the home front and directly in the conflict zones. So, to say that women are generally unsupportive of warfare doesn't seem accurate.\n\nConsidering all this, I think Option B is the most plausible answer. It suggests that women's roles in violence were considered in terms of their impact on the state rather than as issues related to their gender. This aligns with the historical tendency to view security studies through a state-centric lens, where individual experiences, especially along lines of gender, were often overlooked.\n\nIn summary, prior to the late 20th century, the role of women in war was neglected in security studies because their experiences and contributions were primarily seen in terms of their implications for the state's security, rather than as significant in their own right or as gender-specific issues.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
