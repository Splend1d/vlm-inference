                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out if the appellate court will affirm the trial judge's order that the married couple has to pay their share of paving a road that abuts their property. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a partnership that sold a vacant parcel of land to a purchaser using a general warranty deed. In this deed, there's a covenant that requires the grantee and her assigns to share proportionately in the paving of a road that borders the property. So, the original buyer is bound by this covenant, and it's supposed to pass on to future owners through the term \"assigns.\"\n\nThen, the original buyer sells the property to a married couple using a special warranty deed, and this new deed doesn't include any of the conditions about paving the road. The married couple didn't have a lawyer or do a title search, so maybe they didn't know about this covenant.\n\nWhen the road is finished, the married couple refuses to pay their share of the paving costs. The original sellers sue them in equity without a jury, and the judge rules that the couple has to pay their share. Now, the couple is appealing, and I need to see if the appellate court will uphold this decision.\n\nOkay, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, this is a covenant running with the land because it was intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and \"assigns.\"\n\nB. Yes, because a landowner is in any event responsible for her share of improvements to any abutting private roads.\n\nC. No, because the general warranty of the original sellers did not apply beyond the first purchaser.\n\nD. No, because the paving requirement had to be placed in the deed to the married couple and it wasn't.\n\nAlright, let's analyze each option.\n\nStarting with option A: It says that this is a covenant running with the land because it was intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and \"assigns.\" So, the term \"assigns\" is key here. In property law, when a deed includes a covenant that binds the grantee and her \"assigns,\" it typically means that the covenant is intended to run with the land and bind future owners who take the property with knowledge of the covenant.\n\nBut wait, for a covenant to run with the land, there are generally certain requirements that need to be met. One of them is that the covenant must touch and concern the land, meaning it affects the use or enjoyment of the property. Also, there needs to be privity of estate, meaning there must be a successive relationship in title between the original parties and their successors.\n\nIn this case, the original covenant was between the partnership and the first purchaser, and it was passed on to the married couple through the term \"assigns.\" However, the married couple didn't receive the covenant directly in their deed; it was in the previous deed to the first purchaser.\n\nSo, the question is whether this covenant runs with the land and binds the married couple, even though it wasn't explicitly included in their deed.\n\nOption B says yes, because a landowner is in any event responsible for her share of improvements to any abutting private roads. This seems like a different argument. It suggests that, regardless of the covenant, the married couple is responsible for their share of the road improvements because it's a general principle of law that landowners must contribute to the maintenance of private roads that abut their property.\n\nI need to check if this is indeed a general principle of law. In many jurisdictions, property owners are responsible for maintaining boundaries and abutting ways, but whether they are required to contribute to improvements like paving might depend on specific local regulations or agreements.\n\nOption C says no, because the general warranty of the original sellers did not apply beyond the first purchaser. Hmm, this seems a bit confusing. A general warranty deed typically provides certain guarantees from the grantor to the grantee about the title, such as that the grantor has the right to convey the property and that there are no liens or encumbrances on it. But in this case, the covenant is about the grantee's obligations regarding road paving, not about the clear title.\n\nSo, I'm not sure how the general warranty deed relates directly to the covenant. Maybe this option is trying to say that the warranty deed's guarantees don't extend to binding future owners to covenants unless specifically included in subsequent deeds.\n\nOption D says no, because the paving requirement had to be placed in the deed to the married couple and it wasn't. This seems like a straightforward argument. The married couple didn't receive any covenant in their deed, so they shouldn't be bound by it. Generally, for a covenant to bind a subsequent purchaser, it needs to be included in their deed or they must have constructive notice of it.\n\nSince the married couple didn't have a lawyer or do a title search, they might not have had actual knowledge of the covenant. If the covenant wasn't recorded or wasn't included in their deed, they might not be bound by it.\n\nBut wait, the original covenant said it binds the grantee and her \"assigns.\" Does that mean it binds all future owners, even if it's not in their deeds? In some jurisdictions, covenants that run with the land can bind subsequent owners even if they weren't included in their deeds, provided certain conditions are met, such as recording the covenant.\n\nI need to consider if this covenant was recorded somehow or if it's part of the chain of title that would give constructive notice to subsequent purchasers.\n\nAlso, the term \"assigns\" is important. It generally refers to successors in title, which could include future owners. So, the covenant was intended to bind not just the original grantee but also those who take the property from her.\n\nBut again, for the covenant to be enforceable against the married couple, they would need to have had notice of it, either actual or constructive.\n\nLet me think about the equities involved here. The married couple bought the property without a lawyer and without doing a title search, which might be seen as negligent or reckless. Maybe they should have known about the covenant, and therefore should be bound by it.\n\nOn the other hand, if they truly didn't know about it and the covenant wasn't properly recorded or included in their deed, it might be unfair to hold them responsible for it.\n\nThe trial judge ruled that they have to pay their share, so the judge must have found that the covenant binds them despite not being in their deed.\n\nPerhaps the judge relied on the fact that the covenant was part of the public record or that it ran with the land, binding all subsequent owners.\n\nBut from the information given, it's not clear if the covenant was recorded or if it was part of the public record.\n\nWait, the problem says that the original sellers sued in equity without a jury, and the judge ruled in their favor. So, it's an equitable ruling.\n\nIn equity, courts can consider fairness and may impose obligations even if there are technical defects in the conveyancing.\n\nMaybe the judge felt that it was fair to hold the married couple responsible for their share of the paving, regardless of whether they had actual knowledge of the covenant.\n\nOption B suggests that there's a general principle that landowners must contribute to abutting private road improvements, which might support the judge's decision on equitable grounds.\n\nBut I need to see if that's a\u666e\u904d\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u539f\u5219.\n\nOption A seems to be based on the covenant running with the land, which might be another ground for the appellate court to affirm the decision.\n\nOption C seems to be arguing that the general warranty deed's guarantees don't extend to binding future owners to covenants, which might not directly relate to the issue at hand.\n\nOption D is a straightforward argument that since the covenant wasn't in their deed, they shouldn't be bound by it.\n\nGiven that, I need to decide which option is correct.\n\nLet me consider the general principles of property law regarding covenants running with the land.\n\nFor a covenant to run with the land, it must meet several tests:\n\n1. It must touch and concern the land.\n\n2. There must be privity of estate.\n\n3. The covenant must be intended to bind successors.\n\n4. It must be recorded or part of the chain of title to give constructive notice.\n\nIn this case, the covenant touches and concerns the land because it relates to the use and enjoyment of the property (paving the abutting road).\n\nPrivity of estate requires that the parties have a successive relationship in title. Since the married couple is a subsequent owner, they would be in privity with the original grantee.\n\nThe covenant was intended to bind \"assigns,\" which suggests it was meant to bind future owners.\n\nHowever, whether it was recorded or part of the chain of title to give constructive notice is unclear.\n\nIf the covenant was recorded, then the married couple would have constructive notice of it, even if they didn't do a title search.\n\nIf it wasn't recorded, and they didn't have actual knowledge of it, then they might not be bound by it.\n\nGiven that they didn't have a lawyer or do a title search, they might not have actual knowledge, but courts often hold that it's the buyer's responsibility to check the title and be aware of any recorded covenants or restrictions.\n\nSo, if the covenant was recorded, the married couple would be bound by it, whether they knew about it or not.\n\nIf it wasn't recorded, then they might not be bound unless there's some other way they should have known about it.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify whether the covenant was recorded or not, so I have to make an assumption based on typical property law practices.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, covenants affecting real property are required to be recorded to be enforceable against subsequent purchasers.\n\nAssuming that's the case here, and if the covenant was recorded, then the married couple would have constructive notice of it, even without doing a title search.\n\nTherefore, they would be bound by it, and the appellate court would likely affirm the trial judge's order.\n\nOption A seems to align with this reasoning, stating that it's a covenant running with the land because it was intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and \"assigns.\"\n\nOption B suggests another ground for affirming the decision, based on a general principle that landowners must contribute to abutting road improvements.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if that's a universal principle; it might vary by jurisdiction.\n\nOption C seems off-track because the general warranty deed's guarantees are separate from the covenant obligations.\n\nOption D argues against affirming the decision, saying that since the covenant wasn't in their deed, they shouldn't be bound by it.\n\nBut as we've reasoned, if the covenant runs with the land and they had constructive notice of it, they should be bound by it.\n\nTherefore, I think the appellate court would affirm the trial judge's order, and the correct answer is A: Yes, this is a covenant running with the land because it was intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and \"assigns.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
