                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the folk saying \"opposites attract,\" especially in the context of attitudes causing liking. The question is asking how current research views this idea, particularly in relation to different groups like heterosexuals, homosexuals, men, and women. The options are:\n\nA. It does not seem to be true.\n\nB. It seems to be true for heterosexuals but not for homosexuals.\n\nC. It seems to be true for homosexuals but not for heterosexuals.\n\nD. It seems to be true for women but not for men.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First off, the folk saying \"opposites attract\" is a common belief that people with different traits or characteristics are drawn to each other. In the context of attitudes, this would mean that dissimilar attitudes lead to liking or attraction between individuals.\n\nNow, the question is about current research on this topic. I need to recall what contemporary studies say about whether opposites really do attract, and if this varies based on sexual orientation or gender.\n\nLet me start by considering the general idea of whether opposites attract or not. From what I remember, there's a lot of research in social psychology that looks at attraction and relationships. One key concept is similarity attraction, which suggests that people are more attracted to others who are similar to them in various ways, including attitudes, values, and personality traits.\n\nIn fact, numerous studies have found that similarity in attitudes is positively correlated with attraction. For example, Byrne's reciprocal liking theory proposes that we like those who like us, and we assume that similar others will like us more. So, this would suggest that similarity, not opposites, leads to attraction.\n\nBut wait, there's also the idea that complementarity can play a role in attraction. Some theories suggest that people might be attracted to others who complement their own personality traits, perhaps because they balance each other out. For instance, someone who is very organized might be attracted to someone who is more spontaneous.\n\nHowever, when it comes to attitudes, the evidence seems to lean more towards similarity being important for attraction, rather than differences.\n\nLet me think about this in terms of sexual orientation. The question mentions heterosexuals and homosexuals specifically. Does the idea of opposites attracting hold differently for these groups?\n\nI need to be careful here, as sexual orientation is a complex aspect of identity, and research on this specific topic might be limited or have varying findings.\n\nFrom what I can recall, in heterosexual relationships, there might be some expectations about gender roles that could influence perceptions of compatibility. For example, traditional gender roles might suggest that men and women have different traits or roles in a relationship, which could be seen as complementary.\n\nHowever, in terms of attitudes, even in heterosexual relationships, similarity seems to be more important for attraction and relationship satisfaction.\n\nIn homosexual relationships, where both partners identify similarly in terms of gender and attraction, the idea of opposites attracting might manifest differently, if at all.\n\nSome research suggests that in same-sex relationships, partners tend to be more similar in terms of personality traits and attitudes compared to opposite-sex couples. This could be because shared experiences and cultural factors lead to greater similarity.\n\nBut again, this points towards similarity being important, rather than opposites attracting.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems plausible: it does not seem to be true that opposites attract, at least in terms of attitudes.\n\nBut let's consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B says it seems to be true for heterosexuals but not for homosexuals. Given that traditional gender roles might suggest some complementarity in heterosexual relationships, there might be a case for believing that opposites attract in heterosexual couples. However, empirical evidence generally shows that similarity in attitudes is important across all types of relationships, including both heterosexual and homosexual ones.\n\nOption C suggests it's true for homosexuals but not for heterosexuals. This seems less likely, as the idea of opposites attracting might be more aligned with traditional views of heterosexual relationships. Moreover, research indicates that similarity in attitudes is a common factor in attraction across different groups.\n\nOption D proposes that it's true for women but not for men. This seems like a stretch without specific evidence. Generally, both men and women seem to prefer partners who are similar to them in attitudes and values.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the best answer is A: it does not seem to be true.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's any research that specifically supports the idea that opposites attract in certain contexts or groups.\n\nFor example, perhaps in some cultural contexts, the idea of complementarity is stronger, leading to a belief that opposites attract. However, even in those cases, empirical research often finds that similarity is more predictive of attraction.\n\nAnother angle could be that in some personality dimensions, opposites do attract. For instance, some studies have suggested that extroverts and introverts might be attracted to each other, perhaps because they balance each other out.\n\nBut again, when it comes to attitudes, the evidence points towards similarity being more important.\n\nI should also consider the difference between initial attraction and long-term compatibility. It's possible that in the early stages of a relationship, opposites might be attracted to each other due to curiosity or the excitement of differences. However, over time, similarity in attitudes and values becomes more crucial for relationship satisfaction and longevity.\n\nGiven this, even if there is some initial attraction between opposites, long-term compatibility still favors similarity.\n\nTherefore, overall, the folk saying \"opposites attract\" doesn't seem to hold true, especially in terms of attitudes leading to liking.\n\nSo, my final answer is A: it does not seem to be true.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
