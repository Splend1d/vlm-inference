                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about how a large city should report the expense related to new roads in its statement of activities for the current year. The city spent $800,000 on new roads, and these roads have a 20-year useful life. But it mentions that the city doesn't use the modified approach to account for roads. Hmm, I need to figure out what that means and how to calculate the expense for the current year.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall how expenses are typically recognized in governmental accounting, especially for capital assets like roads. In general, expenses can be recognized either on a straight-line basis over the asset's useful life or upfront when the asset is purchased. But the question mentions that the modified approach isn't being used, so maybe there's another way they're handling it.\n\nWait, perhaps the modified approach refers to the modified approach to accounting for infrastructure assets, where expenses are recognized based on consumption or depletion. If that's the case, and they're not using that approach, maybe they're using a different method, like capitalizing the roads and depreciating them over their useful life.\n\nLet me assume that the city is capitalizing the roads as infrastructure assets and depreciating them over their useful life. If they spent $800,000 on new roads and the useful life is 20 years, then the annual depreciation expense would be $800,000 divided by 20 years, which is $40,000 per year. So, the expense for the current year would be $40,000.\n\nBut wait, the options are $0, $20,000, $40,000, and $800,000. So, if I'm right, the answer should be C. $40,000. But let me double-check.\n\nMaybe the city is expensing the entire amount upfront, which would be $800,000, option D. But that seems unlikely in accounting practices, as roads are typically considered capital assets and should be depreciated over their useful lives.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they're using some form of accelerated depreciation, but the question doesn't specify that. Assuming straight-line depreciation is probably the safest bet here.\n\nAnother possibility is that the city is using the consumption approach, where expenses are recognized based on how much the road is being used or degraded each year. But since the modified approach isn't being used, maybe they're sticking to straight-line depreciation.\n\nWait, maybe the \"modified approach\" refers to the modified approach for infrastructure assets as per GASB (Governmental Accounting Standards Board) standards, which allow for recognizing expenses based on consumption. If the city isn't using that approach, perhaps they're still following the old method of capitalizing the roads and depreciating them straight-line over their useful life.\n\nI think my initial calculation is correct. $800,000 divided by 20 years equals $40,000 per year. So, the expense for the current year should be $40,000.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other factor that could affect this. For example, if the roads were purchased partway through the year, maybe the expense would be prorated for the portion of the year they were in service. However, the question doesn't provide any information about when during the year the roads were purchased, so I'll assume it's for the full year.\n\nAlso, if the city is using some sort of pay-as-you-go method, they might not be recognizing any expense in the current year, which would make the answer A. $0. But that seems unlikely, as it would go against generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for governments.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're recognizing half the annual depreciation in the first year, which would be $20,000, option B. But again, without specific information about the depreciation method, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven that, I think the most straightforward and logical answer is C. $40,000, based on straight-line depreciation over the useful life of the roads.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check the other options quickly:\n\nA. $0: This would only make sense if the city isn't recognizing any expense, which isn't typical for capital assets.\n\nB. $20,000: This might be if they're using some form of reduced depreciation in the first year, but there's no indication of that in the question.\n\nD. $800,000: This would be expensing the entire cost upfront, which, as I thought earlier, isn't standard practice for capital assets.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. $40,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
