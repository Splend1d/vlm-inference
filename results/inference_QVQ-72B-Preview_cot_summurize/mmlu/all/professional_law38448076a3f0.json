The intersection is controlled by traffic lights. A businessman was driving his car east on Figueroa Street and did not see the traffic light. He entered the intersection at a time when the light was red for eastbound traffic and green for northbound traffic. A woman, in violation of statute, was proceeding south on Wilshire Street, and she entered the intersection without looking for any cross traffic and struck the businessman's car. The businessman suffered damages in the amount of $5,000. The woman, on the other hand, suffered damages in the amount of $1,000. The businessman brought suit against the woman to recover his damages. The woman denied liability and filed a counterclaim against the businessman for her damages. Both drivers were negligent with 30 percent of the negligence attributable to the woman and 70 percent of the negligence attributable to the businessman. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"A failure to exercise ordinary care, which contributes to personal injury or property damage, shall not bar recovery of damages by the injured party, but damages shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person injured. There shall be no set-off of damages between the respective parties. \" Which of the following is the appropriate judgment in the case?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit involved, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, we have a car accident at the intersection of Wilshire and Figueroa Streets. A businessman is driving east on Figueroa and enters the intersection when the light is red for him and green for northbound traffic on Wilshire. A woman is driving south on Wilshire, which is a one-way street for northbound traffic, so her driving south is against the law. She enters the intersection without looking and hits the businessman's car.\n\nThe businessman has $5,000 in damages, and the woman has $1,000 in damages. The businessman sues the woman for his damages, and she countersues him for her damages. Both drivers are found to be negligent: the woman is 30% at fault, and the businessman is 70% at fault.\n\nThere's also a statute that says:\n\n- If someone's negligence contributes to their own injury or damage, they can still recover damages, but their recovery is reduced in proportion to their own negligence.\n\n- There's no set-off of damages between the parties.\n\nSo, this seems like a case of comparative negligence without any set-off.\n\nLet me recall what comparative negligence is. It's a system where the damages awarded to an injured party are reduced by the percentage of fault that party had in causing the injury. Some states use pure comparative negligence, where the plaintiff can recover even if they're more at fault than the defendant, just with a reduced award. Others use modified comparative negligence, where if the plaintiff is more at fault than the defendant, they can't recover anything.\n\nIn this case, the statute seems to indicate that as long as the plaintiff's negligence contributed to the injury, they can still recover, but their damages are diminished based on their percentage of fault. It also says there's no set-off between the parties. Set-off typically means that if one party owes the other, that amount can be\u62b5\u6d88against what they owe.\n\nSo, given that, I need to figure out how to calculate the damages for both parties considering their respective percentages of fault and the no set-off rule.\n\nLet's start with the businessman:\n\n- His damages are $5,000.\n\n- He is 70% at fault.\n\n- So, his recovery should be reduced by 70%.\n\nSo, his recoverable amount from the woman would be $5,000 minus 70% of $5,000.\n\nCalculate 70% of $5,000:\n\n0.70 * $5,000 = $3,500\n\nSo, his recovery is $5,000 - $3,500 = $1,500 from the woman.\n\nWait, but option C says the businessman recovers $1,500 from the woman, which seems to align with this calculation.\n\nNow, for the woman:\n\n- Her damages are $1,000.\n\n- She is 30% at fault.\n\n- So, her recovery should be reduced by 30%.\n\nSo, her recoverable amount from the businessman would be $1,000 minus 30% of $1,000.\n\nCalculate 30% of $1,000:\n\n0.30 * $1,000 = $300\n\nSo, her recovery is $1,000 - $300 = $700 from the businessman.\n\nAgain, option C shows the businessman recovering $1,500 from the woman and the woman recovering $700 from the businessman.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's any other consideration.\n\nThe statute says there's no set-off between the parties. So, even though the businessman is recovering $1,500 and the woman is recovering $700, they shouldn't offset each other. Each party should receive their respective amounts separately.\n\nOption A suggests the businessman recovers $5,000 and the woman recovers $1,000, which doesn't account for their comparative negligence.\n\nOption B has the businessman recovering $3,500 and the woman $300.\n\nWait, $3,500 for the businessman would be 70% of $5,000, which aligns with the businessman's fault percentage. But according to the statute, damages are diminished in proportion to the plaintiff's negligence, not the defendant's. Wait, I might have misapplied the rule.\n\nLet me read the statute again:\n\n\"A failure to exercise ordinary care, which contributes to personal injury or property damage, shall not bar recovery of damages by the injured party, but damages shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person injured. There shall be no set-off of damages between the respective parties.\"\n\nSo, it's clear that the plaintiff's recovery is reduced by their own percentage of fault.\n\nIn this case, the businessman is the plaintiff in his suit against the woman, and he is 70% at fault. So, his recovery should be reduced by 70%.\n\nSimilarly, the woman is the plaintiff in her counterclaim against the businessman, and she is 30% at fault. So, her recovery should be reduced by 30%.\n\nSo, my initial calculation seems correct: businessman recovers $1,500 (5,000 - 70% of 5,000), and woman recovers $700 (1,000 - 30% of 1,000).\n\nOption C reflects this.\n\nHowever, let's see if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the total damages and apportion them based on fault percentages.\n\nTotal damages are $5,000 + $1,000 = $6,000.\n\nThe woman is 30% at fault, so she should pay 30% of the total damages, which is 0.30 * $6,000 = $1,800.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent with the statute, which specifies that each plaintiff's recovery is reduced based on their own negligence, without any set-off.\n\nSo, perhaps sticking with the initial approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the concept of joint and several liability, but the statute doesn't mention that.\n\nOr perhaps contributory negligence, but the statute explicitly says comparative negligence.\n\nWait, no, it says \"failure to exercise ordinary care... shall not bar recovery... but damages shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person injured.\"\n\nThis sounds like comparative negligence.\n\nMoreover, the problem states that both drivers were negligent with specific percentages attributed to each.\n\nSo, applying comparative negligence:\n\n- Businessman's recovery is $5,000 reduced by his 70% fault: $5,000 - (0.70 * $5,000) = $5,000 - $3,500 = $1,500.\n\n- Woman's recovery is $1,000 reduced by her 30% fault: $1,000 - (0.30 * $1,000) = $1,000 - $300 = $700.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate judgment is:\n\n- Businessman recovers $1,500 from the woman.\n\n- Woman recovers $700 from the businessman.\n\nWhich corresponds to option C.\n\nBut let's check option B: businessman recovers $3,500 and woman $300.\n\nWait, $3,500 for the businessman would be the amount he is reduced by, not what he recovers.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify.\n\nThe businessman's damages are $5,000, and he is 70% at fault, so his recovery is $5,000 minus 70% of $5,000, which is $1,500.\n\nOption B says he recovers $3,500, which would be 70% of his damages, but that doesn't make sense because that would imply he's recovering the amount corresponding to the defendant's fault, which is not how comparative negligence typically works.\n\nSimilarly, the woman's damages are $1,000, and she is 30% at fault, so her recovery should be $1,000 minus 30% of $1,000, which is $700, as in option C.\n\nOption D says the businessman recovers $800 and the woman nothing.\n\nThat doesn't align with the calculations.\n\nOption A suggests the businessman recovers $5,000 and the woman $1,000, ignoring comparative negligence.\n\nSo, option C seems to be the correct one.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor at play.\n\nThe problem mentions that the woman was driving south on a one-way street designated for northbound traffic, which is a violation of the statute. This might imply gross negligence or willful misconduct, but the problem frames it as ordinary negligence.\n\nAlso, the businessman entered the intersection on a red light, which is also a clear violation.\n\nSo, both parties were negligent, with assigned percentages.\n\nGiven that, and the statute's clear instruction on how to handle comparative negligence without set-off, option C seems appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C."
