                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Nagel's view on absolutism, and I need to figure out what he thinks is the core of the absolutist position. The options are:\n\nA. Human persons have a right to life.\n\nB. It is permissible to harm as a foreseen but unintended consequence of action.\n\nC. The ends justify the means.\n\nD. The hostility should be directed at its true object.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who Nagel is and what his views are. Thomas Nagel is a philosopher known for his work in moral philosophy, especially on issues related to morality and mortality. He's written about the nature of moral luck, the experience of death, and the limits of objectivity in ethics.\n\nNow, the term \"absolutist position\" in this context probably refers to some form of moral absolutism, which holds that there are absolute moral rules that must be followed regardless of the consequences or situation. Moral absolutists believe in universal moral principles that apply to all people in all situations.\n\nGiven that, I need to identify which of these options best captures the essence of moral absolutism according to Nagel.\n\nOption A: Human persons have a right to life.\n\nThis seems like a strong statement about the value of human life and suggests that there are inherent rights that should not be violated. This could be seen as an absolutist position, especially if it's held that this right is inviolable under any circumstances.\n\nOption B: It is permissible to harm as a foreseen but unintended consequence of action.\n\nThis sounds like it's related to the doctrine of double effect, which is a principle in ethics that allows for certain actions that cause harm as a side effect, as long as the harm is not intended. This might be compatible with some forms of absolutism, but it's more of a principle about when certain actions are permissible rather than a core tenet of absolutism itself.\n\nOption C: The ends justify the means.\n\nThis phrase is often associated with consequentialism, particularly utilitarianism, which holds that the morality of an action is determined by its outcomes. Consequentialism is typically opposed to moral absolutism, which emphasizes the importance of following moral rules regardless of the consequences.\n\nOption D: The hostility should be directed at its true object.\n\nThis one is a bit unclear. It seems like it might be referring to some idea that blame or criticism should be aimed at the correct target, but without more context, it's hard to see how this directly relates to moral absolutism.\n\nGiven these considerations, option A seems the most straightforward choice. Nagel has written about the value of human life and the moral importance of individual rights. It makes sense that he would view the right to life as a central aspect of moral absolutism.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether Nagel actually holds this position. I recall that in his famous paper \"War and Massacre,\" Nagel discusses the moral issues surrounding war and the killing of innocents. He argues that there are moral constraints on killing, even in war, and that innocent civilians should not be targeted.\n\nThis seems to align with the idea that human life has intrinsic value and that there are absolute moral rules against taking innocent life. So, option A seems plausible.\n\nBut let me think about option B again. The doctrine of double effect is often invoked to justify actions that have both good and bad consequences, provided that the bad consequences are not intended. This is sometimes used to reconcile absolutist moral principles with difficult real-world situations.\n\nFor example, in war, it might be permissible to bomb a military target knowing that some civilians will die incidentally, as long as the primary intention is to hit the military target, not to harm civilians.\n\nThis does seem like a principle that an absolutist might accept, but it's more of a tool for applying absolutist principles in complex situations rather than the core of the absolutist position itself.\n\nOption C, \"the ends justify the means,\" is clearly at odds with moral absolutism. Consequentialism holds that the morality of an action is determined by its outcomes, which directly contradicts the absolutist view that some actions are always wrong, regardless of the consequences.\n\nOption D remains the least clear. Without specific context from Nagel's work, it's difficult to see how this relates to moral absolutism.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the best answer is A: human persons have a right to life. This seems to capture the essence of moral absolutism as Nagel discusses it, emphasizing the intrinsic value of human life and the importance of upholding that value in all circumstances.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
