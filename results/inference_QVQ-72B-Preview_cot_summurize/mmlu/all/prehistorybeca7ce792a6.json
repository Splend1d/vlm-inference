                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about how Pizarro was able to subdue the entire Inca empire. There are four options, and I need to pick the one that best explains why he succeeded. Let me think through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that his horses and guns frightened the Incas into submission. Hmm, that sounds plausible. I remember that the Incas hadn't seen horses or firearms before, so these would have been totally new and maybe intimidating to them. But did they really frighten the Incas into submission? I think the Incas were pretty advanced and had a large population, so I'm not sure if fear alone would make them submit entirely.\n\nOption B says that Pizarro was such a brilliant military strategist. Well, Pizarro was definitely a skilled leader, and he knew how to exploit weaknesses in the Inca empire. But was he that much better than the Incas in terms of military strategy? The Incas had their own military organization, and they must have had some strategies in place. Maybe his tactics were superior, but I'm not entirely convinced that this was the main reason for his success.\n\nOption C suggests that the empire had never won the allegiance of the peoples it had conquered. This is interesting. I recall that the Inca empire was made up of many different ethnic groups and tribes that the Incas had conquered over time. Some of these groups might not have been fully integrated or loyal to the Inca ruler, Atahualpa. If that's the case, then perhaps Pizarro was able to exploit this lack of loyalty and get support from these discontented groups. That could have been a significant factor in his success.\n\nOption D states that he arrived with a superior force of more than 80,000 soldiers. Wait a minute, that seems off. From what I remember, Pizarro initially arrived with a relatively small force. In fact, when he first landed in South America, he had only a few hundred soldiers. It was only later that more Spanish forces arrived. But even then, I don't think they ever mustered anywhere near 80,000 soldiers. Maybe this number is exaggerated, or perhaps it's referring to the combined forces including native allies, but I'm skeptical about this option.\n\nLet me summarize what I've thought about so far. Option A suggests that horses and guns frightened the Incas into submission, but I'm not sure if fear alone would be enough. Option B proposes that Pizarro was a brilliant military strategist, which may be true to some extent, but probably not the main reason. Option C points out that the empire lacked the allegiance of its conquered peoples, which seems plausible and could have been a significant factor. Option D claims that Pizarro had a massive army of over 80,000 soldiers, which I doubt is accurate.\n\nI think I need to do a bit more research to confirm some of these points. Let me look up some information about the Spanish conquest of the Inca empire.\n\nFirst, regarding the size of Pizarro's force: When Pizarro first arrived in Peru in 1532, he had only about 180 men, 27 horses, and a few cannons. This was a very small force compared to the size of the Inca empire, which had a population in the millions. Even later expeditions didn't increase the Spanish numbers by much; the total Spanish forces in South America at that time were still in the low thousands, not tens of thousands.\n\nSo, Option D is definitely incorrect. Pizarro did not arrive with over 80,000 soldiers. That settles that.\n\nNext, Option A: Did the horses and guns really frighten the Incas into submission? While it's true that the Incas had never seen horses or firearms before, and these did initially shock and confuse them, it's unlikely that this fear led to the entire empire's submission. The Incas were experienced warriors themselves and had a well-organized army.\n\nHowever, the psychological impact of the Spanish technology cannot be ignored. The Incas may have seen the Spanish as almost superhuman because of their horses and guns, which gave the Spanish a tactical advantage in battle.\n\nBut, considering that the Incas put up significant resistance in some battles, such as the Battle of Cajamarca and later uprisings, it seems that fear alone wasn't enough to subdue them entirely.\n\nMoving on to Option B: Was Pizarro a brilliant military strategist? While Pizarro was certainly a capable leader and made some smart decisions, such as capturing Atahualpa, the Inca ruler, he wasn't infallible. He also relied heavily on luck and the internal divisions within the Inca empire.\n\nIn fact, one of the key factors in Pizarro's success was exploiting the civil war between Atahualpa and his brother Hu\u00e1scar for the throne. This internal conflict weakened the Inca empire and made it more vulnerable to Spanish invasion.\n\nSo, while Pizarro had some strategic prowess, it was more his ability to take advantage of existing situations rather than devising entirely new military strategies.\n\nFinally, Option C: The empire had never won the allegiance of the peoples it had conquered. This seems particularly relevant. The Inca empire was composed of many different ethnic groups and tribes that had been conquered and incorporated into the empire over centuries. While the Incas imposed their culture, language, and religion on these peoples, there was still resentment and resistance among some of these subject nations.\n\nPizarro and the Spanish were able to form alliances with some of these discontented groups, such as the Chim\u00fa and the Ca\u00f1ari, who provided valuable support and intelligence about Inca tactics and weaknesses.\n\nMoreover, the capture and eventual execution of Atahualpa created a leadership vacuum in the Inca empire, leading to further divisions and confusion among the Inca nobility and the subject peoples.\n\nTherefore, the lack of loyalty and unity within the Inca empire was a significant factor that Pizarro was able to exploit to his advantage.\n\nIn conclusion, while factors like the shock of Spanish technology and Pizarro's leadership played a role, the primary reason for Pizarro's success was the internal divisions and lack of allegiance from the conquered peoples within the Inca empire. So, I believe the correct answer is Option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
