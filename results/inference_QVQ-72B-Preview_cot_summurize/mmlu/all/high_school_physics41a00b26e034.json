                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a car going up an incline. The car is moving with speed \\(v\\) when it reaches the bottom of the incline, and then it coasts up the incline without using the engine. We're supposed to neglect friction and air resistance, and we need to figure out what's happening with the car's horizontal and vertical accelerations, \\(a_x\\) and \\(a_y\\), respectively.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The car is moving up an incline at an angle \\(\\theta\\) from the horizontal. Since it's coasting without the engine and there's no friction or air resistance, the only forces acting on the car are its weight (due to gravity) and possibly some normal force from the incline.\n\nI remember that when an object moves up an incline, gravity pulls it downward, and the incline pushes back with a normal force that's perpendicular to the surface of the incline. Since there's no friction or air resistance, these are the only forces acting on the car.\n\nNow, acceleration is related to the net force acting on the object. So, I need to find the components of the net force in the horizontal and vertical directions to determine \\(a_x\\) and \\(a_y\\).\n\nLet me start by resolving the weight of the car into components that are parallel and perpendicular to the incline. The weight \\(mg\\) can be broken down into:\n\n- A component down the incline: \\(mg \\sin \\theta\\)\n\n- A component perpendicular to the incline: \\(mg \\cos \\theta\\)\n\nSince the car is moving up the incline without the engine, and there's no friction, the only force along the incline is the component of gravity pulling it back down. So, the net force along the incline is \\( -mg \\sin \\theta \\) (negative because it's downward).\n\nThe normal force from the incline should balance the perpendicular component of the weight to prevent the car from sinking into the incline. So, the normal force \\(N = mg \\cos \\theta\\).\n\nNow, to find the acceleration along the incline, I can use Newton's second law:\n\n\\[F_{\\text{net}} = ma\\]\n\n\\[ -mg \\sin \\theta = m a\\]\n\n\\[a = -g \\sin \\theta\\]\n\nThis means the acceleration along the incline is \\( -g \\sin \\theta \\), which is directed downward along the incline.\n\nBut the question is asking for the horizontal and vertical accelerations, not the acceleration along the incline. So, I need to find the components of this acceleration in the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) directions.\n\nFirst, let's define the coordinate system. Assume the horizontal direction is the x-axis, and the vertical direction is the y-axis. The incline makes an angle \\(\\theta\\) with the horizontal.\n\nThe acceleration along the incline is \\( -g \\sin \\theta \\), and this incline is at an angle \\(\\theta\\) from the horizontal.\n\nTo find the horizontal component of this acceleration, I can use:\n\n\\[a_x = (-g \\sin \\theta) \\cos \\theta\\]\n\nAnd the vertical component is:\n\n\\[a_y = (-g \\sin \\theta) \\sin \\theta\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[a_x = -g \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta\\]\n\n\\[a_y = -g \\sin \\theta \\sin \\theta = -g \\sin^2 \\theta\\]\n\nNow, I need to compare these expressions to the options given.\n\nOption A says \\(a_x = 0\\); \\(a_y < g\\)\n\nOption B says \\(a_x = 0\\); \\(a_y = g\\)\n\nOption C says \\(a_x < g\\); \\(a_y < g\\)\n\nOption D says \\(a_x < g\\); \\(a_y = g\\)\n\nLooking at \\(a_x\\):\n\n\\[a_x = -g \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta\\]\n\nSince \\(\\sin \\theta\\) and \\(\\cos \\theta\\) are both positive for \\(\\theta\\) between 0 and 90 degrees, \\(a_x\\) is negative, meaning it's in the opposite direction to the horizontal component of the velocity (if we consider the initial velocity up the incline as positive).\n\nBut the options don't directly mention the direction, they just say \\(a_x < g\\) or \\(a_x = 0\\). So, in terms of magnitude, \\(|a_x| = g \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta\\).\n\nSimilarly, for \\(a_y\\):\n\n\\[a_y = -g \\sin^2 \\theta\\]\n\nAgain, \\(\\sin^2 \\theta\\) is positive, so \\(a_y\\) is negative, meaning downward, but in terms of magnitude, \\(|a_y| = g \\sin^2 \\theta\\).\n\nNow, I need to see how these magnitudes compare to \\(g\\).\n\nFirst, consider \\(a_x\\):\n\n\\[|a_x| = g \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta\\]\n\nUsing the double-angle identity, \\(\\sin 2\\theta = 2 \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta\\), so:\n\n\\[|a_x| = \\frac{1}{2} g \\sin 2\\theta\\]\n\nSince \\(\\sin 2\\theta\\) ranges from 0 to 1 (for \\(\\theta\\) from 0 to 90 degrees), \\(|a_x|\\) ranges from 0 to \\(\\frac{1}{2} g\\), which is always less than \\(g\\).\n\nSo, \\(a_x < g\\).\n\nNext, \\(a_y\\):\n\n\\[|a_y| = g \\sin^2 \\theta\\]\n\nNow, \\(\\sin^2 \\theta\\) ranges from 0 to 1, so \\(|a_y|\\) ranges from 0 to \\(g\\). However, since \\(\\sin^2 \\theta\\) is less than 1 (unless \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\)), \\(|a_y| < g\\) for all \\(\\theta\\) except when \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\), in which case \\(a_y = -g\\).\n\nBut since the problem mentions an incline, I assume \\(\\theta\\) is less than 90 degrees, so \\(a_y < g\\).\n\nTherefore, both \\(a_x < g\\) and \\(a_y < g\\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \\(a_x = 0\\); \\(a_y < g\\)\n\nB. \\(a_x = 0\\); \\(a_y = g\\)\n\nC. \\(a_x < g\\); \\(a_y < g\\)\n\nD. \\(a_x < g\\); \\(a_y = g\\)\n\nOption C matches our findings: \\(a_x < g\\) and \\(a_y < g\\).\n\nBut wait a minute, in option C, it's written as \\(a_x < g\\); \\(a_y < g\\), which seems to indicate that both accelerations are less than \\(g\\), which aligns with our calculations.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any possibility that \\(a_x = 0\\) or \\(a_y = g\\) in certain conditions.\n\nLet's consider \\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\):\n\n- \\(a_x = -g \\sin 0^\\circ \\cos 0^\\circ = 0\\)\n\n- \\(a_y = -g \\sin^2 0^\\circ = 0\\)\n\nSo, both \\(a_x = 0\\) and \\(a_y = 0\\), which doesn't match option A or B, but option C allows for \\(a_x < g\\) and \\(a_y < g\\), which would include \\(a_x = 0\\) and \\(a_y = 0\\).\n\nAt \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\):\n\n- \\(a_x = -g \\sin 90^\\circ \\cos 90^\\circ = -g (1)(0) = 0\\)\n\n- \\(a_y = -g \\sin^2 90^\\circ = -g (1)^2 = -g\\)\n\nSo, \\(a_x = 0\\) and \\(a_y = -g\\), meaning \\(a_y = g\\) in magnitude, but since the problem specifies \"the magnitude of the car's horizontal acceleration \\(a_x\\) and vertical acceleration \\(a_y\\)\", and \\(a_y = g\\) only at \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\), but in that case, the incline is vertical, which might not be typical for an incline in this context.\n\nHowever, according to our earlier analysis, \\(a_y < g\\) for \\(\\theta < 90^\\circ\\), and \\(a_y = g\\) only at \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption C: \\(a_x < g\\); \\(a_y < g\\)\n\nOption D: \\(a_x < g\\); \\(a_y = g\\)\n\nGiven that \\(a_y < g\\) for \\(\\theta < 90^\\circ\\) and \\(a_y = g\\) only at \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\), option C seems more general and covers all angles \\(\\theta\\) except \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\), where \\(a_y = g\\), but since \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) is a special case, and the problem likely considers \\(\\theta < 90^\\circ\\), option C is the best choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the general case where \\(\\theta\\) is not specified, and to choose the option that correctly describes \\(a_x\\) and \\(a_y\\) in terms of their relationship to \\(g\\).\n\nGiven that, and since for all \\(\\theta < 90^\\circ\\), \\(a_y < g\\), and for \\(\\theta < 90^\\circ\\), \\(a_x < g\\), option C seems correct.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any scenario where \\(a_x = 0\\) or \\(a_y = g\\).\n\nIf \\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\):\n\n- \\(a_x = 0\\)\n\n- \\(a_y = 0\\)\n\nWhich satisfies \\(a_x < g\\) and \\(a_y < g\\).\n\nIf \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\):\n\n- \\(a_x = 0\\)\n\n- \\(a_y = -g\\), so magnitude \\(g\\)\n\nWhich would mean \\(a_x < g\\) but \\(a_y = g\\), matching option D.\n\nHowever, if the problem considers \\(\\theta < 90^\\circ\\), then \\(a_y < g\\), matching option C.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects us to consider only \\(\\theta < 90^\\circ\\), in which case \\(a_y < g\\), making option C correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is C for general \\(\\theta\\), and D only applies when \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\), but since \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) is a specific case, and the problem likely considers \\(\\theta < 90^\\circ\\), option C is the best choice.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \\(a_x < g\\); \\(a_y < g\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
