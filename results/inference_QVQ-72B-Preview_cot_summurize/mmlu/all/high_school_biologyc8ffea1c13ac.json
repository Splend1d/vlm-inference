                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question about cells and how their structure shows that all life is unified. So, basically, it's asking which aspect of cell structure proves that everything alive is connected or similar in some fundamental way. Okay, let's look at each option.\n\nFirst, option A says that all cells are surrounded by a plasma membrane. That sounds right. I remember from biology class that one of the defining features of a cell is that it's enclosed by a plasma membrane, which regulates what comes in and out. So, if all cells have this, it suggests a commonality among all forms of life, right?\n\nOption B says that all cells have at least one nucleus. Hmm, I know that in prokaryotes, like bacteria, they don't have a membrane-bound nucleus. So, they're lacking that structure. But eukaryotes do have a nucleus. So, if all cells have a nucleus, that wouldn't be correct because bacteria don't. Therefore, this can't be the answer.\n\nOption C says that all cells carry out cellular respiration in mitochondria. Again, thinking back to prokaryotes, they don't have mitochondria. Mitochondria are only found in eukaryotic cells. So, bacteria and archaea perform cellular respiration differently, if they do at all. So, this can't be a universal aspect of all cells.\n\nOption D says that the surface-to-volume ratio of all cells is the same. I know that smaller cells have higher surface-to-volume ratios, which is important for diffusion and getting nutrients and oxygen. Larger cells have lower ratios, which can be a problem for getting enough resources to their interior. But I don't think that all cells have the same surface-to-volume ratio. There's a lot of variation in cell sizes, from tiny bacteria to large plant cells.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems to be the correct answer because all cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic, have a plasma membrane. It's a universal feature of life as we know it. The other options either don't apply to all cells or aren't universal in their presence or function.\n\nWait a minute, just to be thorough, is there any exception to cells having a plasma membrane? I can't think of any. Even the smallest bacteria have a plasma membrane, and eukaryotes definitely do. So, yeah, I think A is the best answer here.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I should consider if there are any cellular structures that are even more fundamental or universal than the plasma membrane. For example, all cells have cytoplasm, but that's more of a contents inside the membrane. The plasma membrane itself seems to be the boundary that defines the cell.\n\nAnother thought: in viruses, which are sometimes considered on the edge of life, they don't have a plasma membrane, but they're not considered cells anyway. So, for cellular life, the plasma membrane is indeed universal.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. Option A is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
