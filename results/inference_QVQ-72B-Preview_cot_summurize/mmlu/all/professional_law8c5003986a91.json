A stream is a non-navigable watercourse that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into a valley. Both the ranch and the estate are within the watershed of the stream. When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate. The millionaire then brings an appropriate action in 1996 to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the millionaire moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the common law of riparian rights, but does not follow the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom?\n\nA. The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.\nB. The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use.\nC. The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.\nD. The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this water rights case here, and I need to figure out who has the superior right to the stream water: the rancher or the millionaire. The state follows the common law of riparian rights but doesn't follow the doctrine of prior appropriation. The period of prescription is 15 years, and it's 1996 now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what riparian rights are. Riparian rights generally mean that landowners whose property borders a watercourse have the right to reasonable use of the water. The key here is \"reasonable use.\" So, both the rancher and the millionaire have riparian rights because their properties are within the watershed of the stream.\n\nBut there's a hierarchy or priority among these rights, and that's where things get tricky. The question mentions that the state doesn't follow the doctrine of prior appropriation, which is a water rights principle used in some places, especially in the western United States, where the first to put water to beneficial use has priority. Since this state doesn't follow that, I need to look elsewhere for guidance.\n\nIn common law riparian rights, typically, upstream landowners have the right to use water as long as they don't unreasonably harm downstream users. Downstream users have similar rights but must consider the effects on those further downstream. However, in some jurisdictions, downstream users might have priority because they are closer to the source of the water.\n\nWait a minute, the rancher is upstream, and the millionaire is downstream. If riparian rights give upstream landowners the right to use water as long as they don't harm downstream users, does that mean the rancher has priority?\n\nBut option A says the rancher has superior rights because he's upstream. Option B says the rancher has superior rights because domestic use is superior to agricultural use. Option C says the millionaire has an easement by prescription, and option D says the millionaire has superior rights because he put the water to beneficial use first and has continuously used it.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, establish the timeline:\n\n- 1956: Millionaire buys the estate and starts using stream water to irrigate the southern half of his property for farming.\n\n- 1986: Rancher builds a home on the ranch and starts taking water from the stream for domestic purposes.\n\n- 1996: Millionaire sues to declare his water rights are superior to the rancher's and seeks to have all the stream water directed to him, even if it affects the rancher.\n\nSo, the millionaire started using the water in 1956, and the rancher in 1986.\n\nNow, under riparian rights, since both are riparian owners, they both have rights to the water. But there might be a priority based on when they started using the water or the type of use.\n\nOption A claims that the rancher has superior rights because he's upstream. But is that always the case? In some legal systems, downstream users have priority because they're closer to the source and might have better access to the water. In others, upstream users have priority because they can control the flow. I need to find out which one applies here.\n\nOption B says that domestic use is superior to agricultural use. That makes sense because domestic use is necessary for human consumption and health, whereas agricultural use is more related to economic activities. So, in times of scarcity, domestic needs might take precedence over agricultural needs.\n\nOption C mentions an easement by prescription. An easement by prescription is when someone uses another person's property in a certain way over a period of time, and under certain conditions, they can acquire a legal right to continue that use. The prescription period here is 15 years.\n\nThe millionaire started using the water in 1956, and it's now 1996. That's 40 years of continuous use. If the prescription period is 15 years, then after 15 years of continuous and open use, the millionaire would have acquired a prescriptive easement to use the water. So, by 1971, he would have had that easement.\n\nBut does that easement give him superior water rights? Or does it just give him the right to continue using the water in the same manner?\n\nOption D says the millionaire has superior rights because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used it. This sounds similar to the doctrine of prior appropriation, which the state doesn't follow. So, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nBut perhaps there's a common law principle that recognizes the priority of prior beneficial use even without following the doctrine of prior appropriation strictly.\n\nLet me consider the concept of \"prior appropriation\" versus \"riparian rights.\" Prior appropriation is a system where the first to put water to beneficial use has priority, regardless of location along the watercourse. Riparian rights, on the other hand, are based on ownership of land adjacent to the watercourse and grant reasonable use of the water.\n\nSince the state doesn't follow prior appropriation, riparian rights should govern. But within riparian rights, there might be rules about priority based on the type of use or the sequence of use.\n\nIn many riparian rights jurisdictions, downstream users have priority over upstream users because they are closer to the natural flow of the water. The reasoning is that upstream users should not use so much water that it deprives downstream users of their reasonable share.\n\nIn this case, the rancher is upstream, and the millionaire is downstream. So, under this principle, the millionaire might have priority.\n\nAdditionally, the millionaire has been using the water since 1956, which is much earlier than the rancher's use in 1986. So, even within riparian rights, perhaps there's a first-in-time, first-in-right principle applied.\n\nWait, but the state doesn't follow the doctrine of prior appropriation, which is where first-in-time, first-in-right applies. So, maybe not.\n\nBut perhaps there's a similar principle in riparian rights law that gives some priority to earlier users, especially if their use is reasonable and established.\n\nAlso, considering the prescriptive easement, since the millionaire has been using the water continuously for 40 years, which is well beyond the 15-year prescription period, he likely has a valid prescriptive easement to continue using the water in the manner he has been.\n\nSo, even if riparian rights were to be equally divided, the prescriptive easement would give the millionaire additional rights to use the water as he has been.\n\nNow, the question is whether this prescriptive easement gives him the right to all the water he has been using, or just the right to continue using it in the same manner as before.\n\nIf it's the latter, then he can continue using the water as he has been, but the rancher might still have some rights to use the water for domestic purposes.\n\nBut the millionaire is seeking to have all the water directed to him, which would leave the rancher without water.\n\nGiven that domestic use is generally considered a higher priority than agricultural use, perhaps the rancher's domestic use should take precedence over the millionaire's agricultural use.\n\nHowever, the millionaire has a prescriptive easement, which might override that.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nIn riparian rights, each landowner has the right to make reasonable use of the water, considering the rights of others.\n\nWhen water is scarce, as it is in this scenario, the uses have to be balanced.\n\nGiven that domestic use is essential for human health and welfare, it's often given priority over agricultural uses, which are more related to economic activities.\n\nSo, in this case, the rancher's domestic use might be considered more important than the millionaire's irrigation use.\n\nTherefore, the rancher should have the right to use the water for domestic purposes, even if that means the millionaire doesn't get all the water he wants.\n\nBut the millionaire has been using the water for a long time and has a prescriptive easement.\n\nDoes the prescriptive easement give him the right to all the water he has been using, or just the right to continue using it in the same manner?\n\nI think it's the latter. A prescriptive easement typically allows the user to continue using the property (in this case, the water) in the same way they have been using it, but it doesn't necessarily give them exclusive rights to the entire water supply.\n\nSo, the millionaire has the right to continue using the water for irrigation as he has been, but the rancher also has the right to use the water for domestic purposes.\n\nIn times of scarcity, the domestic use should take precedence over agricultural use.\n\nTherefore, the rancher's domestic use should be satisfied first, and then any remaining water can be used by the millionaire for irrigation.\n\nBut the millionaire is seeking a judgment declaring his rights superior and wants all the water directed to him, regardless of the impact on the rancher.\n\nGiven the principles I've considered, that doesn't seem reasonable.\n\nSo, perhaps the judgment should be in favor of the rancher, at least in part, to protect his domestic water use.\n\nBut option A just says the rancher has superior rights because he's upstream, which may not be entirely accurate.\n\nOption B says the rancher has superior rights because domestic use is superior to agricultural use, which seems more on point.\n\nOption C says the millionaire has an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need, but I don't think that's accurate. The prescriptive easement likely allows him to continue using the water in the manner he has been, not to take as much as he wants.\n\nOption D says the millionaire has superior rights because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher and has continuously used it. But again, since the state doesn't follow prior appropriation, this might not apply.\n\nGiven all that, I think the best answer is B: the rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use.\n\nHowever, I have some doubts. Maybe the millionaire's long-term use and prescriptive easement give him some advantage.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nThe prescriptive easement would give the millionaire the right to continue using the water for irrigation as he has been, but it doesn't necessarily make his rights superior to the rancher's domestic use.\n\nIn riparian rights jurisdictions, domestic use is generally given higher priority than agricultural use, especially in times of scarcity.\n\nSo, even though the millionaire has been using the water longer and has a prescriptive easement, the rancher's domestic use should take precedence.\n\nTherefore, the judgment should be for the rancher, with the understanding that his domestic use is protected and should be satisfied before the millionaire's irrigation use.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
