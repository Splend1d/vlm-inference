                    "text": "So Jerry read a 200-page book in 10 hours. I need to find out how long it will take him to read a 320-page book at the same rate. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out his reading rate. If he read 200 pages in 10 hours, then his rate is 200 pages per 10 hours. To make it easier, maybe I should find out how many pages he reads per hour. Let's divide 200 by 10 to get his reading speed.\n\n200 pages \u00f7 10 hours = 20 pages per hour.\n\nSo, Jerry reads 20 pages every hour.\n\nNow, if I have a 320-page book, I need to find out how many hours it will take to read 320 pages at a rate of 20 pages per hour.\n\nLet me set up an equation for this. Let\u2019s say time = pages \u00f7 rate.\n\nSo, time = 320 pages \u00f7 20 pages per hour.\n\n320 \u00f7 20 = 16 hours.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check if there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could use proportions. If 200 pages take 10 hours, then 320 pages should take (10 hours \u00d7 320 pages) \u00f7 200 pages.\n\nLet me calculate that: 10 \u00d7 320 \u00f7 200.\n\nFirst, 10 \u00d7 320 = 3200.\n\nThen, 3200 \u00f7 200 = 16 hours.\n\nYeah, that matches my previous result. So, it should be 16 hours.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for. Is there any assumption here that might not hold? For example, maybe his reading speed isn't constant throughout the book, but the problem says \"at that rate,\" so I think it's safe to assume a constant rate.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find out how many times 200 goes into 320. So, 320 \u00f7 200 = 1.6 times. Since 200 pages take 10 hours, 1.6 times that would be 1.6 \u00d7 10 hours = 16 hours.\n\nAgain, that points to 16 hours being the correct answer.\n\nLet me see if I can approach it using fractions. If 200 pages = 10 hours, then 1 page would take 10 \u00f7 200 = 0.05 hours, which is 3 minutes per page. For 320 pages, it would be 320 \u00d7 0.05 hours = 16 hours.\n\nWait, that's another way that also leads to 16 hours.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of direct variation: time is directly proportional to the number of pages, assuming the reading speed is constant.\n\nSo, time (t) is proportional to pages (p), or t = k \u00d7 p, where k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nFrom the first scenario, t = 10 when p = 200, so k = 10 \u00f7 200 = 0.05 hours per page.\n\nThen, for p = 320, t = 0.05 \u00d7 320 = 16 hours.\n\nSame as before.\n\nLet me consider if perhaps the reading speed decreases over time due to fatigue, but the problem assumes a constant rate, so I don't think that's necessary here.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can use a ratio. Pages to hours is 200:10, and 320:x. Setting up the proportion: 200/10 = 320/x.\n\nSolving for x: 200/10 = 320/x \u21d2 20 = 320/x \u21d2 x = 320/20 \u21d2 x = 16 hours.\n\nAgain, 16 hours.\n\nI think by now I'm confident that the answer is 16 hours. Let's check the options:\n\nA. 16 hours\n\nB. 18 hours\n\nC. 24 hours\n\nD. 32 hours\n\nSo, the correct choice is A. 16 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 16 \\ \\text{hours}} \\]"
