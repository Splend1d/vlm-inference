                    "text": "Let's see what this problem is asking. So, Conor made 9 shapes with straws, and each shape had 5 straws. Then, he used 15 more straws to make more shapes. The question is asking for the total number of straws Conor used to make all the shapes. Okay, I need to find the total straws used in all shapes.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many straws he used initially for the 9 shapes. Since each shape has 5 straws, I should multiply 9 by 5. Let's do that: 9 times 5 is 45. So, he used 45 straws for the first 9 shapes.\n\nThen, he used 15 more straws to make additional shapes. So, I need to add those 15 straws to the initial 45 straws to find the total straws used. Let's add 45 plus 15. That should be straightforward: 45 + 15 equals 60.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can visualize it differently to confirm. He made 9 shapes, each with 5 straws, so 9 times 5 is indeed 45. Then, he used 15 more straws for more shapes, so adding 45 and 15 gives 60. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of total straws used for all shapes combined. So, initial straws plus additional straws equals total straws used. That would be 45 plus 15, which is still 60.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. Is there any possibility of overlapping straws or reused straws? The problem doesn't specify any reuse of straws, so I think each straw is used only once. So, no need to account for overlapping.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the total number of shapes made after using the additional straws. He initially made 9 shapes, and then used 15 more straws. If each new shape requires 5 straws, then 15 divided by 5 is 3 additional shapes. So, total shapes would be 9 plus 3, which is 12 shapes. But the question is asking for the total number of straws used, not the total number of shapes.\n\nWait, maybe I should check that. Total shapes are 12, and each shape has 5 straws. So, 12 times 5 would be 60 straws. That matches my earlier calculation of 45 plus 15 equals 60.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, I'm confident that the total number of straws used is 60.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 20\n\nB. 29\n\nC. 45\n\nD. 60\n\nSo, option D. 60 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider why the other options might be wrong. Option C is 45, which is the initial number of straws used for the first 9 shapes, but that doesn't account for the additional 15 straws used for more shapes. Option B is 29, which doesn't seem to relate directly to the problem's numbers. Option A is 20, which is even lower than the initial straws used, so that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 60.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
