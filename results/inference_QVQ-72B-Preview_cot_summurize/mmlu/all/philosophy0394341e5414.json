The statement is: \"According to Sartre, there is at least one being in whom existence precedes essence, and this being is _____.\" The options are God, man, primitive man, or future man.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Sartre means by \"existence precedes essence.\" I recall that Sartre was a existentialist philosopher, and one of his central ideas is that for certain beings, especially humans, they exist first, and then they define their essence through their choices and actions. This is in contrast to other entities where their essence or nature is predetermined.\n\nSo, in Sartre's view, for humans, existence comes before essence. That means we are born, we exist, and then we shape who we are through the choices we make in life. It's about freedom and responsibility in creating our own nature.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. God\n\nBut wait, Sartre was an atheist, so he didn't believe in God. So, it doesn't make sense that he would say God's existence precedes essence. Moreover, in many religious traditions, God is considered to have necessary being, so essence might be seen as preceding existence, but Sartre would likely not hold that view.\n\nB. man\n\nThis seems plausible. Sartre famously said, \"Existence precedes essence,\" in his work \"Existentialism Is a Humanism.\" He was referring to human beings. So, \"man\" here probably stands for human beings in general, not just males.\n\nC. primitive man\n\nThis seems similar to \"man,\" but maybe there's a distinction. \"Primitive man\" could refer to early humans or less developed societies. However, Sartre's philosophy applies to all human beings, not just a specific type. So, it's likely that \"primitive man\" is a subset of \"man,\" and thus less comprehensive.\n\nD. future man\n\nThis seems to suggest humans in the future. But again, Sartre's idea applies to all humans, present and future. So, it's not exclusive to future humans.\n\nGiven this, I think the best answer is B. man, meaning human beings in general. Sartre believed that for humans, existence comes before essence, and this applies to all humans, not just primitive or future ones.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something specific about primitive or future humans that Sartre might have emphasized differently. For example, perhaps he thought that in primitive societies, existence more strongly precedes essence due to less societal constraints. But I don't recall any specific statements to that effect.\n\nSimilarly, for future humans, maybe he thought that with technological advancements or changes in society, existence would still precede essence. But again, nothing suggests that future humans would have a different relationship between existence and essence.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward and accurate answer is B. man, referring to human beings in general.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
