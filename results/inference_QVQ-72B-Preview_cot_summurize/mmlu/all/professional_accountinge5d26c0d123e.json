                    "text": "So I have this question about the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that an employee who resigns regardless of cause is eligible for unemployment benefits. Hmm, I thought that to qualify for unemployment benefits, you had to lose your job through no fault of your own, like being laid off or fired without cause. If someone quits voluntarily, especially without good reason, they might not be eligible. But maybe there are exceptions? I should look into that.\n\nOption B states that the federal unemployment system is funded by both employer and employee taxes. I recall that unemployment taxes are primarily paid by employers under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA). Employees don't usually pay into this system directly. So, is this statement accurate?\n\nOption C says that the Act is intended to assist workers who are permanently out of work and need assistance in supporting themselves. Wait, I thought unemployment benefits were designed to provide temporary financial assistance to people who are unemployed through no fault of their own, not necessarily permanently out of work. Permanent unemployment might be a different situation. Maybe this isn't correct.\n\nOption D mentions that the unemployment insurance system is administered by the states through their employment laws. I know that while the federal government sets certain standards through the FUTA, the actual administration and determination of unemployment benefits are handled by each state's employment agencies. So, this seems plausible.\n\nLet me summarize what I think:\n\n- A: Probably not always true, as quitting a job might disqualify you from unemployment benefits unless there's a good reason.\n\n- B: Unemployment taxes are mainly paid by employers, not employees, under FUTA.\n\n- C: Unemployment benefits are for temporary support, not necessarily permanent unemployment.\n\n- D: States administer the unemployment insurance systems based on their own laws and regulations.\n\nSo, based on this, option D seems to be the correct statement: The unemployment insurance system is administered by the states through their employment laws.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me double-check a few points.\n\nFirst, regarding option A: In general, if you quit your job voluntarily without good cause, you're unlikely to be eligible for unemployment benefits. However, if you had a valid reason for quitting, such as unsafe working conditions or a significant pay cut, you might still qualify. But the statement says \"regardless of cause,\" which would suggest that even if you quit for no particular reason, you'd still be eligible, which isn't usually the case. So, I think A is incorrect.\n\nFor option B: The Federal Unemployment Tax Act does indeed impose a tax on employers to fund unemployment benefits. Employees don't contribute to this tax; it's solely the responsibility of the employer. Therefore, B is incorrect because it suggests that both employers and employees pay into the system.\n\nOption C: Unemployment insurance is indeed intended to provide temporary financial assistance to workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, such as layoffs or reductions in force. It's not designed for permanent unemployment; that might be covered by other social safety net programs. So, C is likely incorrect.\n\nOption D: This is accurate. The unemployment insurance program is administered by each state according to its own laws and regulations, although they must meet certain federal guidelines to receive funding under FUTA.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
