Kantian theory.\n\nC. version of utilitarianism.\n\nD. version of virtue ethics.\n\nHmm, I need to recall what Locke's views on morality were. I know that John Locke was an English philosopher from the 17th century, and he's famous for his ideas on government, property, and personal identity. But what about his moral philosophy?\n\nLet me think about natural law. Natural law theory suggests that there are moral principles that are inherent in nature and can be discovered through reason. It's often associated with thinkers like Thomas Aquinas. Did Locke subscribe to natural law? I think he did mention natural law in some of his works, especially in his Second Treatise of Government. He talks about the state of nature and natural rights like life, liberty, and property. So, maybe option A is a possibility.\n\nBut what about Kantian theory? Immanuel Kant was a German philosopher who lived a bit later, in the 18th century. His moral theory is based on the categorical imperative and the idea that moral actions are those done out of duty, not for any particular outcome. Since Kant came after Locke, it's unlikely that Locke would have been influenced by him or accepted his theory. So, option B seems unlikely.\n\nNext, utilitarianism. This is a moral theory that evaluates the morality of actions based on their consequences, specifically whether they maximize happiness or utility for the greatest number of people. Utilitarianism was developed by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill in the 19th century, which is after Locke's time. So, again, it's improbable that Locke would have accepted utilitarianism. Option C is probably not correct.\n\nLastly, virtue ethics. This approach focuses on the character and virtues of the moral agent rather than on the rules or consequences of actions. It has roots in ancient Greek philosophy, particularly in the works of Aristotle. Locke was familiar with classical philosophy, so he might have been influenced by virtue ethics. However, I don't recall him developing a specific version of virtue ethics in his writings.\n\nGiven this, I'm leaning towards option A: natural law conception of morality. Locke did discuss natural law in his political philosophy, and it seems consistent with his ideas on rights and government. Plus, the other options are from philosophers who came after him, so it wouldn't make sense for him to accept theories that hadn't been proposed yet.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should check if there's any evidence that Locke had a different view. For example, did he ever explicitly reject natural law? I don't think so. In fact, in his Second Treatise, he talks about how in the state of nature, people are governed by natural law, which dictates that they should not harm one another and should respect each other's rights.\n\nAlso, regarding virtue ethics, while Locke might have appreciated the idea of virtues, his political philosophy seems more focused on individual rights and the social contract rather than on cultivating moral character traits. So, option D seems less likely than option A.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the best answer is A. natural law conception of morality.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
