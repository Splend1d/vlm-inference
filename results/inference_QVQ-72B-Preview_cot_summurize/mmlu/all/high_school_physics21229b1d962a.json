                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about a string attached to a vibrating speaker. It says that at a frequency of 60 Hz, standing waves are not produced in the string. I need to figure out why that is, and choose the correct explanation from the options provided.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basics about standing waves on a string. Standing waves occur when an incident wave and its reflection interfere constructively. For a string fixed at both ends, the possible wavelengths that can produce standing waves are those where an integer number of half-wavelengths fit into the length of the string. So, the condition is:\n\nL = n * (\u03bb/2)\n\nwhere L is the length of the string, n is an integer (1, 2, 3, ...), and \u03bb is the wavelength.\n\nThe frequency of the standing wave is related to the wavelength by:\n\nf = v / \u03bb\n\nwhere v is the wave speed on the string.\n\nSo, combining these, we can express the frequency in terms of n, v, and L:\n\nf = v / (2L/n) = (n v)/(2L)\n\nThis means that for standing waves to occur, the frequency must be an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency, which is v/(2L).\n\nNow, the problem states that at 60 Hz, standing waves are not produced. That means that 60 Hz is not one of the possible resonant frequencies of the string for the given length and wave speed.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. The string length is not a multiple of half the wavelength of the wave.\n\nWell, according to the condition L = n * (\u03bb/2), the string length must be an integer multiple of half the wavelength for standing waves to occur. So, if 60 Hz doesn't produce standing waves, it could be because the wavelength corresponding to 60 Hz doesn't satisfy this condition for the given string length.\n\nBut wait, the wavelength depends on the wave speed and the frequency: \u03bb = v / f. So, if f = 60 Hz, and v is fixed (since the tension and linear mass density are constant), then \u03bb is determined. If L is not equal to n * (\u03bb/2) for any integer n, then standing waves won't form. So, this option seems plausible.\n\nB. The wave speed on the string is fixed.\n\nThis is actually a given in the problem. The string has fixed tension and linear mass density, so the wave speed v is constant. The wave speed is determined by:\n\nv = sqrt(T/\u03bc)\n\nwhere T is the tension and \u03bc is the linear mass density. Since both are constant, v is fixed. So, this option is stating a fact but doesn't directly explain why standing waves aren't formed at 60 Hz.\n\nC. 60 Hz is in the lowest range of audible sound.\n\nThis seems irrelevant to the situation. The audible range for humans is generally considered to be from about 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz, so 60 Hz is well within that range. Moreover, whether the frequency is audible or not shouldn't affect the formation of standing waves in the string. So, this option doesn't seem correct.\n\nD. The wavelength of the wave produced by the speaker is equal to the speed of waves on the string divided by 60 Hz.\n\nThis option is essentially restating the definition of wavelength: \u03bb = v / f. So, if f = 60 Hz and v is constant, then \u03bb = v / 60. But this doesn't explain why standing waves aren't formed; it's just a restatement of the relationship between wavelength, wave speed, and frequency.\n\nSo, considering all options, A seems to be the most relevant explanation. If the string length isn't a multiple of half the wavelength, standing waves won't form at that frequency.\n\nBut let me double-check. Suppose the string length L is such that L = n * (\u03bb/2) for some integer n when f = 60 Hz. Then standing waves should form. If not, then standing waves shouldn't form, which matches the given scenario.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any other factor that could prevent standing waves from forming at 60 Hz. For example, if the speaker doesn't produce enough amplitude or if there's damping, but the problem doesn't mention any of that. It only says that standing waves are not produced at 60 Hz, and asks for the explanation.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward explanation is that the string length isn't a multiple of half the wavelength corresponding to 60 Hz, hence option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
