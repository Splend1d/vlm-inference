The excerpt is from the Progressive Party Platform in 1912, which talks a lot about justice, equality, and protecting the people's interests. It seems like it's aligned with progressive values, right?\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Theodore Roosevelt's \"Square Deal\" was all about. I remember that Roosevelt was a Republican president before the Progressive Party came about, but he had some progressive tendencies. His \"Square Deal\" was his approach to governing, focusing on three main areas: conservation of natural resources, control of corporations through antitrust litigation, and consumer protection.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Conservation, trust-busting, consumer protection\n\nB. Protective tariffs, centralized banking, conservation\n\nC. Equal opportunity, women's suffrage, laissez-faire economics\n\nD. Laissez-faire economics, support of labor unions, conservation\n\nOption A seems to align closely with what I recall about the \"Square Deal.\" Conservation was a big part of Roosevelt's presidency; he established several national parks and protected a lot of land. Trust-busting refers to breaking up large monopolies, which Roosevelt did with cases like the Northern Securities Company. Consumer protection also fits, as his administration passed the Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act to ensure safer products.\n\nOption B mentions protective tariffs and centralized banking. I know that Roosevelt was involved in tariff issues, but I don't recall protective tariffs being a central part of his \"Square Deal.\" Centralized banking wasn't established until after his presidency, with the Federal Reserve Act in 1913. Conservation is there again, but since it's already covered in option A, and the other parts don't seem to fit, I'll set this one aside.\n\nOption C includes equal opportunity, women's suffrage, and laissez-faire economics. While Roosevelt was known for promoting conservation and trust-busting, I don't remember him being a strong advocate for women's suffrage. Also, laissez-faire economics suggests a hands-off approach, but Roosevelt was quite active in regulating industries. So, this seems inconsistent with his policies.\n\nOption D has laissez-faire economics again, support of labor unions, and conservation. Similar to option C, laissez-faire doesn't align with Roosevelt's active regulatory approach. However, he did have some support for labor unions, like in the case of the Anthracite Coal Strike in 1902, where he intervened to help resolve the dispute. But overall, his approach wasn't purely laissez-faire.\n\nGiven these considerations, option A seems to be the most accurate characterization of Theodore Roosevelt's \"Square Deal.\" It covers his key areas of focus: conservation, trust-busting (antitrust actions), and consumer protection.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. I recall that the \"Square Deal\" was summarized by Roosevelt as a fair deal for both businesses and consumers, with the government intervening when necessary to prevent unfair practices. So, trust-busting was a part of that, as was ensuring safe products for consumers. Conservation was indeed a major part of his presidency, so that fits as well.\n\nNone of the other options capture the essence of the \"Square Deal\" as accurately as option A. Option B introduces protective tariffs and centralized banking, which weren't central to his program. Options C and D include laissez-faire economics, which contradicts Roosevelt's active regulatory policies.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option A: conservation, trust-busting, consumer protection.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
