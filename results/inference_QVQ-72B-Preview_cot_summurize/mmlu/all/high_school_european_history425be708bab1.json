It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nA follower of Marx and Engels's view of history would argue that an all-out war between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat classes was\n\nA. a destructive development that could be avoided through the study of philosophy\nB. a possibility which should be encouraged in order to foster progress\nC. an inevitable result of fundamental economic change\nD. an example of history repeating itself\n"

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about Marx and Engels and their view of history, specifically relating to their famous work, The Communist Manifesto. The question is asking what a follower of their view would argue about an all-out war between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat classes. The options are:\n\nA. A destructive development that could be avoided through the study of philosophy\n\nB. A possibility which should be encouraged in order to foster progress\n\nC. An inevitable result of fundamental economic change\n\nD. An example of history repeating itself\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Marx and Engels believed about history and class struggles. The excerpt mentions that history is the history of class struggles and that society is splitting into two main classes: the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. These are, respectively, the owners of the means of production and the working class who sell their labor.\n\nMarx and Engels argued that these class struggles are inherent in capitalist societies and that they lead to social change. They believed that the contradictions within capitalism would eventually lead to its downfall and the rise of a classless society through revolution.\n\nSo, considering that, how would a follower of their view see an all-out war between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat?\n\nOption A suggests that it's a destructive development that could be avoided through philosophy. But Marx and Engels actually saw the class struggle as a driving force of historical progress. They didn't necessarily see it as something to be avoided; rather, they saw it as inevitable and necessary for the advancement to a communist society.\n\nOption B says it's a possibility that should be encouraged to foster progress. While Marx and Engels did believe that the class struggle would lead to progress, they weren't necessarily advocating for actively starting a war. They more so predicted that the tensions inherent in the system would naturally lead to revolution.\n\nOption C posits that it's an inevitable result of fundamental economic change. This seems quite aligned with Marx and Engels's views. They believed that the economic base of society determines its superstructure, including its class relations. As capitalism develops, they argued, the divide between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat sharpens, leading inevitably to conflict.\n\nOption D claims it's an example of history repeating itself. While Marx and Engels did believe that history had patterns and that class struggles had occurred repeatedly, their view was more that history was moving towards a specific end point\u2014the establishment of a classless society\u2014rather than endlessly repeating itself.\n\nBetween these options, C seems the most accurate. Marx and Engels viewed the conflict between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat as inevitable due to the economic changes brought about by capitalism. They believed that the proletariat would rise up against the bourgeoisie in a revolution that would overthrow the capitalist system and lead to a communist society.\n\nSo, a follower of Marx and Engels would likely argue that such a war is an inevitable result of fundamental economic change.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
