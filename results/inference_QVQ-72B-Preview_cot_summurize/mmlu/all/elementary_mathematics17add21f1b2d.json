I need to find out which number from options A to D she would not count in this sequence.\n\nFirst, I should understand what it means to count by 2s. It means she's adding 2 each time, starting from 2. So, the sequence is 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and so on, up to 50. All these numbers are even because counting by 2s from 2 will only give even numbers.\n\nSo, all the numbers she counts are even. Now, looking at the options:\n\nA. 11\n\nB. 22\n\nC. 34\n\nD. 48\n\nI need to see which one of these is not an even number, because that would be the one she doesn't count.\n\nWait, but all the options except A are even numbers. Let me check:\n\nA. 11 \u2013 That's an odd number. So, it's not even.\n\nB. 22 \u2013 Even\n\nC. 34 \u2013 Even\n\nD. 48 \u2013 Even\n\nSo, 11 is the only odd number among the options. Since Lucy is counting only even numbers in her sequence, 11 would not be counted.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure. The question says she starts at 2 and stops at 50, counting by 2s. So, she's counting even numbers from 2 to 50 inclusive.\n\n11 is an odd number, so it's not in this sequence. Therefore, the answer should be A. 11.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's a trick here.\n\nIs there any possibility that 11 could be counted in some other way? For example, if she was counting by 2s and somehow reached 11, but no, 11 is odd, and she's counting only even numbers.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to say that 11 is the number she would not count.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 11} \\]"
