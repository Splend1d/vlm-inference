                    "text": "So I have this question: \"Who was the WNBA's Most Valuable Player of 1999?\" and the options are Rebecca Lobo, Sheryl Swoopes, Lisa Leslie, and Yolanda Griffith. I need to figure out who won the MVP title that year.\n\nFirst off, I know that the WNBA is the Women's National Basketball Association, and the MVP is the Most Valuable Player award given at the end of the season. But I don't remember off the top of my head who won it in 1999.\n\nLet me think about each player:\n\nRebecca Lobo: She was a famous player, especially known for her college career at UConn and playing for the New York Liberty. I think she was really good, but I'm not sure about her stats in 1999.\n\nSheryl Swoopes: She played for the Houston Comets, I believe. She was known for her scoring abilities and was a prominent figure in the WNBA. Maybe she had a strong season in 1999.\n\nLisa Leslie: She was with the Los Angeles Sparks, right? She's another legendary player, known for her dominance in the paint and being the first woman to dunk in a WNBA game. Could she have won the MVP in 1999?\n\nYolanda Griffith: She played for the Sacramento Monarchs, I think. She was a tough defender and a rebounding machine. Maybe she had an outstanding season that year.\n\nI need to recall or find out who actually won the MVP in 1999. Let me try to think of some ways to figure this out.\n\nI remember that the WNBA started in 1997, so 1999 would be its third season. Maybe I can think about which of these players had their peak during that time.\n\nRebecca Lobo was already well-established by then, but I think her best years were earlier in her career.\n\nSheryl Swoopes was part of the Houston Comets, who were very successful in the late 90s, winning multiple championships. Maybe she was the MVP in 1999.\n\nLisa Leslie started her WNBA career in 1997 and quickly became a star. She was known for her all-around skills and leadership on the court.\n\nYolanda Griffith was also a key player for the Sacramento Monarchs, contributing with her defensive skills and rebounding.\n\nI think I should look up the actual MVP for 1999 to make sure I get this right.\n\nWait a minute, I think I have an idea. I recall that Lisa Leslie won the MVP award in 2001 and 2006, and Sheryl Swoopes won it in 2000 and 2002. That might help narrow it down.\n\nIf Lisa Leslie won in 2001 and 2006, and Sheryl Swoopes in 2000 and 2002, then who won in 1999?\n\nLet me see... I think Yolanda Griffith won the MVP in 1999.\n\nTo confirm, I can try to recall if any of these players were particularly noted for their performance in the 1999 season.\n\nYolanda Griffith was indeed a standout player for the Sacramento Monarchs, and I believe she had a fantastic season in 1999, leading her team and being recognized with the MVP award.\n\nRebecca Lobo, while a great player, might have been past her prime by 1999, or perhaps didn't have the same level of impact that season.\n\nSheryl Swoopes and Lisa Leslie both won MVP awards in subsequent years, but for 1999, I think it was Yolanda Griffith who took home the trophy.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider some statistics. In 1999, Yolanda Griffith averaged around 18 points and 10 rebounds per game, which was excellent for that time. She was also known for her defensive contributions, which might have made her a strong candidate for the MVP.\n\nSheryl Swoopes, while a great scorer, might not have had her best season in 1999 compared to other years when she won the MVP.\n\nLisa Leslie was also a top player, but I believe her peak MVP years were later on, in 2001 and 2006.\n\nTherefore, based on my recollection of their careers and the specific season in question, I'm fairly confident that Yolanda Griffith was the WNBA's Most Valuable Player in 1999.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Yolanda Griffith.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\text{ Yolanda Griffith}} \\]"
