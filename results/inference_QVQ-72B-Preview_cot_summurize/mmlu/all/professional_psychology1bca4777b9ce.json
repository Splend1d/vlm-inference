                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about brief crisis-oriented therapy. The options are:\n\nA. Explore early childhood experiences related to the problem\n\nB. Try to ensure that the client becomes calm and relaxed\n\nC. Agree upon clear-cut goals and keep the sessions focused on these goals\n\nD. Be open and nondirective, allowing the client the greatest latitude in exploring all aspects of the crisis situation\n\nI need to pick which one is characteristic of brief crisis-oriented therapy.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what brief crisis-oriented therapy is all about. The name suggests that it's a type of therapy that's short-term and focused on crises. So, it's likely designed to help people deal with immediate problems or crises rather than long-term issues.\n\nOption A talks about exploring early childhood experiences. That sounds more like something you'd do in long-term therapy, like psychoanalysis, where they look deep into a person's past to understand their current problems. But in brief crisis-oriented therapy, since it's crisis-focused, I doubt they'd have time to delve into early childhood. Crises are usually urgent and require quick intervention, so focusing on the here and now seems more appropriate.\n\nOption B says try to ensure the client becomes calm and relaxed. That sounds like a general goal in many therapies, especially those that deal with anxiety and stress. In a crisis situation, helping someone calm down is probably important, but is it the main characteristic of brief crisis-oriented therapy? Maybe it's a part of it, but I don't think it's the primary focus.\n\nOption C mentions agreeing upon clear-cut goals and keeping sessions focused on these goals. This sounds very structured and goal-oriented. In crisis situations, having clear objectives and focusing on specific issues makes sense because time is limited, and quick solutions or coping mechanisms might be necessary. This seems plausible.\n\nOption D suggests being open and nondirective, allowing the client the greatest latitude in exploring all aspects of the crisis situation. This sounds more like client-centered therapy, where the therapist takes a non-directive approach and follows the client's lead. However, in a crisis-oriented therapy that's brief, I wonder if a more directive approach is necessary to address the crisis effectively and efficiently.\n\nLet me think about this again. Brief crisis-oriented therapy is likely to be time-limited and focused on resolving specific crises. So, it probably involves setting specific goals and working towards them in a structured way. That points towards option C.\n\nOption A, exploring early childhood experiences, seems more relevant for long-term therapies where there's time to look back into a person's history. In a crisis situation, there might not be enough time for that, and the focus would be more on the present issue.\n\nOption B, ensuring the client is calm and relaxed, is important, but it's more of a byproduct or a necessary step rather than the main characteristic of the therapy.\n\nOption D, being open and nondirective, might not be the best approach in a crisis where quick and targeted interventions are needed.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I think the correct answer is option C: agree upon clear-cut goals and keep the sessions focused on these goals.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me do a quick search to confirm.\n\nOkay, I found that brief crisis-oriented therapy is indeed focused on immediate problems and aims to provide rapid relief from distress. It emphasizes setting specific, achievable goals and using techniques that are\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5f3a\u7684 to the crisis at hand. So, that aligns with option C.\n\nExploring early childhood experiences is more common in psychodynamic or psychoanalytic therapies, which are long-term and not crisis-oriented. So, option A is probably incorrect.\n\nEnsuring the client is calm and relaxed is a component of many therapies, but it's not the defining characteristic of brief crisis-oriented therapy. So, option B is likely incorrect.\n\nBeing open and nondirective is characteristic of client-centered therapy, which is more about providing a supportive environment where the client can explore their feelings. While this might be useful in some crisis situations, brief crisis-oriented therapy tends to be more structured and directive to address the crisis quickly. So, option D is probably incorrect.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
