                    "text": "So I've got this problem here with two statements about group theory, and I need to determine whether each statement is true or false. I'm a bit rusty on group theory, but I'll try to work through this step by step.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: \"If a group has an element of order 10, then it has elements of orders 1, 2, and 5.\"\n\nOkay, so first off, I need to recall what it means for an element to have a certain order in a group. The order of an element \\( g \\) in a group \\( G \\) is the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( g^n = e \\), where \\( e \\) is the identity element of the group. So, if there's an element of order 10, that means repeating the group operation 10 times brings us back to the identity.\n\nNow, the statement claims that if there's an element of order 10, then there must be elements of orders 1, 2, and 5. Let me think about this.\n\nI remember that in group theory, there are theorems related to the orders of elements and subgroups. For instance, Lagrange's Theorem states that the order of any subgroup of a finite group \\( G \\) divides the order of \\( G \\). But here, we're dealing with the orders of elements, not subgroups directly.\n\nWait, but the order of an element \\( g \\) is the same as the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by \\( g \\), which is \\( \\langle g \\rangle \\). So, if \\( g \\) has order 10, then \\( |\\langle g \\rangle| = 10 \\).\n\nBy Lagrange's Theorem, the order of any subgroup divides the order of the group. So, the possible orders of subgroups of \\( \\langle g \\rangle \\) are divisors of 10, which are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n\nBut the statement is saying that there are elements of orders 1, 2, and 5 in the group \\( G \\), given that there's an element of order 10.\n\nI think I need to consider the cyclic subgroup generated by the element of order 10. In a cyclic group of order 10, there are elements of orders dividing 10. Specifically, there should be elements of orders 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n\nLet me recall that in a cyclic group \\( \\langle g \\rangle \\) of order \\( n \\), for each divisor \\( d \\) of \\( n \\), there is exactly one subgroup of order \\( d \\), and it is generated by \\( g^{n/d} \\).\n\nSo, in this case, \\( n = 10 \\), and its divisors are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n\n- For order 1: \\( g^{10} = e \\), which is the identity element.\n\n- For order 2: \\( g^{5} \\), because \\( (g^5)^2 = g^{10} = e \\), and \\( g^5 \\neq e \\).\n\n- For order 5: \\( g^2 \\) and \\( g^8 \\), since \\( (g^2)^5 = g^{10} = e \\), and similarly for \\( g^8 \\).\n\n- For order 10: \\( g \\) itself.\n\nSo, within the cyclic subgroup \\( \\langle g \\rangle \\), there are elements of orders 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n\nBut the statement is about the group \\( G \\), not necessarily \\( \\langle g \\rangle \\). So, if \\( G \\) has an element of order 10, then \\( G \\) contains the cyclic subgroup \\( \\langle g \\rangle \\) of order 10, which in turn contains elements of orders 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n\nTherefore, \\( G \\) does indeed have elements of orders 1, 2, and 5, as those elements exist in \\( \\langle g \\rangle \\), which is a subgroup of \\( G \\).\n\nSo, Statement 1 is true.\n\nNow, moving on to Statement 2: \"If a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it has an element of order 6.\"\n\nAlright, so here we have a group \\( G \\) with an element \\( a \\) of order 2 and an element \\( b \\) of order 3. We need to determine if there must be an element of order 6 in \\( G \\).\n\nFirst, I should recall that the order of a product of two elements in a group can be determined under certain conditions.\n\nIn general, if \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) commute (i.e., \\( ab = ba \\)), then the order of the product \\( ab \\) can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[ |ab| = \\frac{|a| \\cdot |b|}{\\gcd(|a|, |b|)} \\]\n\nwhere \\( |a| \\) is the order of \\( a \\), \\( |b| \\) is the order of \\( b \\), and \\( \\gcd \\) is the greatest common divisor.\n\nGiven that \\( |a| = 2 \\) and \\( |b| = 3 \\), and since \\( \\gcd(2, 3) = 1 \\), then:\n\n\\[ |ab| = \\frac{2 \\cdot 3}{1} = 6 \\]\n\nSo, if \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) commute, then \\( ab \\) has order 6.\n\nHowever, the statement doesn't specify that \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) commute. So, this reasoning only applies if \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) do commute.\n\nWhat if \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) do not commute? Can we still conclude that there is an element of order 6 in \\( G \\)?\n\nI need to consider whether it's always the case that there exists an element of order 6, regardless of whether \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) commute.\n\nLet me think of an example where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) do not commute.\n\nConsider the symmetric group \\( S_3 \\), which has order 6. It's a non-abelian group, so elements do not necessarily commute.\n\nIn \\( S_3 \\), there is an element of order 2, which is a transposition, say \\( (1\\ 2) \\), and an element of order 3, which is a 3-cycle, say \\( (1\\ 2\\ 3) \\).\n\nLet's check if their product has order 6.\n\nCompute \\( (1\\ 2)(1\\ 2\\ 3) \\):\n\nFirst, apply \\( (1\\ 2\\ 3) \\): 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 3, 3 goes to 1.\n\nThen apply \\( (1\\ 2) \\): 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 1, 3 remains 3.\n\nSo, the product is \\( (1\\ 2)(1\\ 2\\ 3) = (1\\ 3\\ 2) \\), which is another 3-cycle, and thus has order 3.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Even though \\( (1\\ 2) \\) has order 2 and \\( (1\\ 2\\ 3) \\) has order 3, their product is \\( (1\\ 3\\ 2) \\), which has order 3, not 6.\n\nSo, in this case, \\( ab \\) does not have order 6 because \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) do not commute.\n\nBut does this mean that there is no element of order 6 in \\( S_3 \\)?\n\nActually, in \\( S_3 \\), the elements of order 6 are the 3-cycles, but wait\u20143-cycles have order 3, not 6.\n\nWait, no: in \\( S_3 \\), the only elements of order 6 would be those whose order is 6, but in \\( S_3 \\), the possible orders are 1, 2, 3, and there is no element of order 6.\n\nSo, in this case, even though there are elements of orders 2 and 3, there is no element of order 6.\n\nBut does this contradict the general statement?\n\nWait, the statement says: \"If a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it has an element of order 6.\"\n\nBut in \\( S_3 \\), which has elements of orders 2 and 3, there is no element of order 6.\n\nTherefore, the statement cannot be true in general, because we've found a counterexample where it fails.\n\nSo, Statement 2 is false.\n\nWait a minute, but earlier I thought that if \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) commute, then \\( ab \\) has order 6.\n\nSo, perhaps in abelian groups, the statement holds, but in non-abelian groups, it may not hold.\n\nBut the statement doesn't specify the type of group, so it's supposed to hold for any group.\n\nGiven that we've found a counterexample where it doesn't hold (\\( S_3 \\)), then the statement is false.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct answer should be C. True, False.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's see if there's any other perspective that might change this conclusion.\n\nConsidering that in some groups, the product of elements of orders 2 and 3 could generate an element of order 6, but as we've seen, it's not always the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to Statement 2.\n\nLet me consider the orders of elements in a group where there are elements of orders 2 and 3.\n\nIf the group is abelian, then indeed, the product \\( ab \\) would have order 6, as shown earlier.\n\nBut if the group is non-abelian, like \\( S_3 \\), then it's possible to have elements of orders 2 and 3 without having an element of order 6.\n\nTherefore, the statement is not universally true, as there are groups where it doesn't hold.\n\nHence, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, the final answer is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
