                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about an abelian group (G, o). It says that G is abelian, and I need to figure out which one of these options is necessarily true for G.\n\nFirst off, let's make sure I understand what an abelian group is. An abelian group is a group where the group operation is commutative. That means for any two elements g and h in G, g o h = h o g. That's pretty straightforward.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. g = g\u207b\u00b9 for every g in G.\n\nHmm, this would mean that every element is its own inverse. While there are groups where this is true, like the Klein four-group, it's not a general property of all abelian groups. For example, in the integers under addition, the inverse of 1 is -1, which is not equal to 1. So, this can't be true for all abelian groups.\n\nB. g = g\u00b2 for every g in G.\n\nWait, g\u00b2 usually means g o g. So, this would mean that every element is equal to its square. That seems even more restrictive than option A. Again, in the integers under addition, 1 + 1 \u2260 1. So, this also doesn't hold for all abelian groups.\n\nC. (g o h)\u00b2 = g\u00b2 o h\u00b2 for every g, h in G.\n\nLet's see what this means. (g o h)\u00b2 = (g o h) o (g o h). Since the group is abelian, we can rearrange the terms: (g o h) o (g o h) = g o h o g o h. Because of commutativity, this is equal to g o g o h o h, which is g\u00b2 o h\u00b2. So, (g o h)\u00b2 = g\u00b2 o h\u00b2. This seems to hold for all abelian groups because of the commutative property.\n\nD. G is of finite order.\n\nThis would mean that G has a finite number of elements. But abelian groups can be infinite, like the integers under addition. So, this isn't necessarily true for all abelian groups.\n\nBased on this reasoning, option C seems to be the correct choice. Let me double-check.\n\nIn option C, we have (g o h)\u00b2 = g\u00b2 o h\u00b2. In an abelian group, since g o h = h o g, we can confirm that (g o h) o (g o h) = g o h o g o h. Because of commutativity, we can rearrange this to g o g o h o h, which is g\u00b2 o h\u00b2. So, yes, this identity holds for all abelian groups.\n\nOption A is not true for all abelian groups, as seen with the integers under addition, where 1 \u2260 -1.\n\nOption B is also not true for the same reason; 1 + 1 \u2260 1 in the integers under addition.\n\nOption D is not necessarily true because there are infinite abelian groups.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
