                    "text": "So I have this question about natural polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils. It's asking how many carbon atoms they have and what kind of double bonds they feature. The options are a bit confusing, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a polyunsaturated fatty acid is. I remember from biology class that fatty acids have a long chain of carbon atoms, and the number of double bonds between these carbons determines whether they're saturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated. Saturated fats have no double bonds, monounsaturated have one, and polyunsaturated have two or more double bonds.\n\nSo, polyunsaturated means multiple double bonds. Now, the question specifies \"natural\" polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils. Vegetable oils are typically rich in polyunsaturated fats, which are considered healthier options compared to saturated fats.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 18 carbon atoms with one carbon-carbon double bond in the cis configuration.\n\nThis sounds like a monounsaturated fatty acid since there's only one double bond. But the question is about polyunsaturated fatty acids, which should have at least two double bonds. So, this can't be right.\n\nB. 20 carbon atoms with at least two carbon-carbon double bonds in the cis configuration.\n\nThis suggests that these fatty acids have 20 carbons and multiple double bonds in the cis configuration. However, I thought that most polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils have 18 carbons, like linoleic acid, which is a common polyunsaturated fatty acid in many vegetable oils.\n\nC. 18 carbon atoms with at least two carbon-carbon double bonds in the trans configuration.\n\nThis option mentions trans configuration. I know that trans fats are generally considered unhealthy and are often found in processed foods. But the question specifies \"natural\" polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils, which are usually in the cis configuration, not trans.\n\nD. 18 carbon atoms with at least two carbon-carbon double bonds in the cis configuration.\n\nThis seems to align with what I know about polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils. They typically have 18 carbons and multiple double bonds in the cis configuration.\n\nLet me double-check this. Linoleic acid, for example, which is a polyunsaturated fatty acid with 18 carbons and two double bonds, is found in many vegetable oils like corn oil and soybean oil. Another one is alpha-linolenic acid, also with 18 carbons but three double bonds, found in flaxseed oil.\n\nSo, according to this, option D seems correct. But let's make sure about the trans configuration in option C. Trans fats are indeed found in some vegetable oils, but they are usually the result of hydrogenation processes used in food manufacturing, not naturally occurring in significant amounts in most vegetable oils.\n\nSome vegetable oils, like palm oil, can contain small amounts of trans fats naturally, but they are minimal. Generally, the polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils are in the cis configuration.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most accurate answer: 18 carbon atoms with at least two carbon-carbon double bonds in the cis configuration.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there are any natural polyunsaturated fatty acids with 20 carbons in vegetable oils. Yes, arachidonic acid has 20 carbons and four double bonds, and it can be found in some vegetable oils, like evening primrose oil and borage oil. However, it's less common than the 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the majority of polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils have 18 carbons and multiple double bonds in the cis configuration, I believe option D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
