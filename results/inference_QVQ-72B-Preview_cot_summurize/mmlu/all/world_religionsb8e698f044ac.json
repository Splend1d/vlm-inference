Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means in the context of Sikhism.\n\nStarting with Sangat: I believe Sangat refers to the congregation or the assembly of Sikh devotees who come together to pray and sing hymns from the Guru Granth Sahib, which is the holy scripture of Sikhism. So, it's more about the gathering of people rather than the meal itself.\n\nNext, Langar: I've heard of Langar before. I think it's the community kitchen where free meals are served to everyone, regardless of their background or social status. This seems promising because it involves a communal meal, which is what the question is asking about.\n\nThen, Gurdwara: This is the term used for a Sikh place of worship. So, it's the building or the temple where Sikhs go to pray and participate in religious activities. While it's where the communal meal might be offered, it's not directly referring to the meal itself.\n\nLastly, Panth: I'm less familiar with this term. I believe Panth refers to the Sikh community as a whole or the collective body of Sikhs. It's more about the community structure rather than a specific practice like a communal meal.\n\nSo, based on this understanding, Langar seems to be the most fitting answer. It's specifically related to the communal meal served at the place of worship, which aligns with the question being asked.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. In Sikhism, one of the key principles is equality and community service. Langar is a manifestation of this principle, where everyone sits together on the floor and shares a meal, demonstrating that all are equal in the eyes of God.\n\nAlso, I recall that before partaking in the Langar, people often volunteer to help with cooking and serving the food, which further emphasizes the importance of community service and cooperation.\n\nGiven this additional context, it reinforces my initial thought that Langar is the correct term for the communal meal offered at the place of worship in Sikhism.\n\nSo, to sum it up, among the given options\u2014Sangat, Langar, Gurdwara, and Panth\u2014the term that specifically refers to the communal meal in Sikhism is Langar.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B.
