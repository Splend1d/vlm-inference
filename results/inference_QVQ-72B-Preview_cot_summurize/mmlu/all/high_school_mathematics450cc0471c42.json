                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to find the value of this expression: \\((2^{20} + 2^{20} + 2^{20} + 2^{21}) \\div 2^{17}\\). Hmm, at first glance, it looks like there are a lot of terms involving powers of 2, which can be a bit tricky, but I think I can simplify it.\n\nFirst, I notice that \\(2^{20}\\) appears three times in the numerator. So, that means it's \\(3 \\times 2^{20}\\) plus \\(2^{21}\\). Maybe I can factor out a common power of 2 to make this easier.\n\nWait a minute, \\(2^{21}\\) can also be expressed in terms of \\(2^{20}\\). Since \\(2^{21} = 2 \\times 2^{20}\\), that might make it simpler to combine like terms.\n\nSo, rewriting the numerator:\n\n\\(2^{20} + 2^{20} + 2^{20} + 2^{21} = 3 \\times 2^{20} + 2^{21}\\)\n\nAnd since \\(2^{21} = 2 \\times 2^{20}\\), I can write:\n\n\\(3 \\times 2^{20} + 2 \\times 2^{20} = 5 \\times 2^{20}\\)\n\nSo now, the expression becomes:\n\n\\((5 \\times 2^{20}) \\div 2^{17}\\)\n\nNow, I recall that when dividing powers with the same base, I can subtract the exponents. So, \\(2^{20} \\div 2^{17} = 2^{20-17} = 2^{3} = 8\\).\n\nTherefore, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\(5 \\times 8 = 40\\)\n\nWait, but let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. Let's see, I combined the \\(2^{20}\\) terms into \\(3 \\times 2^{20}\\), and then added \\(2^{21}\\), which is \\(2 \\times 2^{20}\\), making it \\(5 \\times 2^{20}\\). Then, dividing by \\(2^{17}\\), which is equivalent to multiplying by \\(2^{3}\\), giving 8, and finally, \\(5 \\times 8 = 40\\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach it differently to confirm. Let's try breaking it down again.\n\nStarting with the original expression:\n\n\\((2^{20} + 2^{20} + 2^{20} + 2^{21}) \\div 2^{17}\\)\n\nI can factor out \\(2^{17}\\) from the numerator to make it easier. So, let's write each term as a multiple of \\(2^{17}\\).\n\nFirst, \\(2^{20} = 2^{17} \\times 2^{3}\\), since \\(2^{20} = 2^{17+3} = 2^{17} \\times 2^{3}\\).\n\nSimilarly, \\(2^{21} = 2^{17} \\times 2^{4}\\).\n\nSo, plugging these back into the expression:\n\n\\((2^{17} \\times 2^{3} + 2^{17} \\times 2^{3} + 2^{17} \\times 2^{3} + 2^{17} \\times 2^{4}) \\div 2^{17}\\)\n\nNow, factor out \\(2^{17}\\) from the numerator:\n\n\\(2^{17}(2^{3} + 2^{3} + 2^{3} + 2^{4}) \\div 2^{17}\\)\n\nThe \\(2^{17}\\) in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving:\n\n\\(2^{3} + 2^{3} + 2^{3} + 2^{4}\\)\n\nNow, calculate each term:\n\n\\(2^{3} = 8\\), so three of those are \\(3 \\times 8 = 24\\)\n\n\\(2^{4} = 16\\)\n\nAdding them up: \\(24 + 16 = 40\\)\n\nOkay, this matches my previous result of 40. So, I'm pretty confident now that the answer is 40.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using logarithms or other properties, but that might be overkill for this problem. The way I did it seems straightforward and consistent.\n\nI should also consider if there's any trick or potential mistake in the problem. For example, if the exponents were different or if there were negative exponents, but in this case, all exponents are positive and follow standard rules.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the operations are being performed in the correct order. The expression has addition and division, and according to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), division should be done before addition. However, in this case, since division is the last operation, it's applied to the entire sum.\n\nSo, yeah, I think I've confirmed it sufficiently. The answer should be 40.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 20\n\nB. 40\n\nC. 0\n\nD. 10\n\nSo, the correct choice is B. 40.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
