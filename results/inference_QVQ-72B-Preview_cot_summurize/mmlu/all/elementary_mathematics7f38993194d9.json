                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to find the product of 0.07 and 5.8. So, that means I have to multiply these two numbers together. I'm a bit rusty on multiplying decimals, but I think I can figure it out.\n\nFirst, I'll ignore the decimals and just multiply 7 and 58. 7 times 58 is the same as 7 times 50 and 7 times 8. 7 times 50 is 350, and 7 times 8 is 56. So, added together, that's 350 plus 56, which is 406. So, 7 times 58 is 406.\n\nNow, I need to place the decimal point in the right place. I started with 0.07 and 5.8. Let's see, 0.07 is seven hundredths, and 5.8 is five and eight tenths.\n\nTo multiply decimals, I think you add the number of decimal places from both numbers. 0.07 has two decimal places, and 5.8 has one decimal place. So, altogether, that's three decimal places.\n\nTherefore, the answer should have three digits after the decimal point. So, taking the 406 we got from multiplying 7 and 58, I need to place the decimal point three places to the left.\n\nLet's try that: 406 becomes 4.06 if I move the decimal point two places to the left, but wait, that's only two places. I need three places. So, moving it three places to the left from 406 would be 0.406.\n\nLet me double-check that. Starting with 406, moving the decimal one place makes it 40.6, two places makes it 4.06, and three places makes it 0.406.\n\nSo, the product of 0.07 and 5.8 should be 0.406.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 0.406\n\nB. 0.0406\n\nC. 4.06\n\nD. 40.6\n\nMy calculation leads me to choose option A. 0.406.\n\nWait a minute, let me see if there's another way to think about this. Maybe I can use the fact that 0.07 is the same as 7/100, and 5.8 is the same as 58/10.\n\nSo, multiplying fractions: (7/100) times (58/10). Multiplying the numerators: 7 times 58 is 406, and multiplying the denominators: 100 times 10 is 1000.\n\nSo, the product is 406/1000. Simplifying that, I can divide both numerator and denominator by 2, which gives me 203/500. But wait, that doesn't seem to match my earlier result of 0.406.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me check. 406 divided by 1000 is indeed 0.406, which matches my earlier answer. So, perhaps 203/500 is equivalent to 0.406, but it seems like an unnecessary complication.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the position of the decimal point in 406 divided by 1000. Since 1000 is the same as moving the decimal point three places to the left, which again confirms that 406/1000 is 0.406.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 0.406, which is option A.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other approach or potential mistake I might have made. For example, maybe I should have considered the placement of the decimal differently.\n\nLet me try multiplying 0.07 by 5.8 step by step. First, 0.07 times 5 is 0.35, and 0.07 times 0.8 is 0.056. Then, adding those together: 0.35 plus 0.056 is 0.406. Again, this leads me to the same answer, 0.406.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of powers of ten. Since 0.07 is 7 \u00d7 10^{-2} and 5.8 is 5.8 \u00d7 10^{0}, multiplying them would give 7 \u00d7 5.8 \u00d7 10^{-2} \u00d7 10^{0} = 40.6 \u00d7 10^{-2} = 0.406.\n\nAnother way is to consider estimating the product. 0.07 is approximately 7/100, and 5.8 is almost 6. So, 7/100 times 6 is 42/100, which is 0.42. But wait, that's different from my previous results.\n\nHold on, where did that come from? Oh, I see. I used 6 instead of 5.8. Let's correct that. If I use 5.8 instead of 6, it would be 7/100 times 5.8. 7 times 5 is 35, and 7 times 0.8 is 5.6, so total 35 + 5.6 = 40.6, divided by 100 is 0.406. Again, confirming the same answer.\n\nI think I've approached this problem from multiple angles and consistently arrived at the same conclusion. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is option A. 0.406.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check the other options quickly. Option B is 0.0406, which seems too small compared to the original numbers. Option C is 4.06, which might be tempting, but based on my calculations, that would require moving the decimal point only two places instead of three, which doesn't align with the number of decimal places in the factors.\n\nOption D is 40.6, which seems too large, as multiplying two numbers less than one should result in a product that's smaller than both original numbers.\n\nTherefore, the only logical and mathematically consistent answer is option A. 0.406.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 0.406} \\]"
