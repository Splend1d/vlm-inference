                    "text": "So I have this question about when Mohenjo-daro developed into a complex urban center. The options are given in terms of different dynasties and time periods, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Mohenjo-daro is. I know that it's an ancient city that's part of the Indus Valley Civilization. I think it's located in present-day Pakistan. But when exactly did it become a complex urban center?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. During the Early Shang Dynasty, from 1,000 to 400 B.P.\n\nB. During the Qin Dynasty, from 3,500 to 3,000 B.P.\n\nC. During the Mature Harappan period, from 4,500 to 4,000 B.P.\n\nD. During the Early Harappan period, from 8,500 to 6,000 B.P.\n\nHmm, B.P. stands for \"before present,\" which is a way to measure time before the present time, with the present being defined as 1950 A.D. So, for example, 1,000 B.P. would be around 950 A.D.\n\nNow, I need to think about the timeline of the Indus Valley Civilization. I remember that it had several phases:\n\n1. Early Harappan phase (about 3300-2600 BCE)\n\n2. Mature Harappan phase (about 2600-1900 BCE)\n\n3. Late Harappan phase (about 1900-1300 BCE)\n\nWait, but the options are given in B.P. So, 1,000 B.P. is around 950 A.D., which is way after the Indus Valley Civilization existed.\n\nLet me convert the B.P. dates to approximate years BCE/CE to see which period corresponds to the development of Mohenjo-daro.\n\nOption A: 1,000 to 400 B.P. would be around 950 A.D. to 1550 A.D. But the Indus Valley Civilization was long gone by then.\n\nOption B: 3,500 to 3,000 B.P. would be around 1550 B.C.E. to 1050 B.C.E. The Indus Valley Civilization was declining around that time, but Mohenjo-daro was already a developed city before that.\n\nOption C: 4,500 to 4,000 B.P. would be around 2550 B.C.E. to 1950 B.C.E. This seems closer to the Mature Harappan period.\n\nOption D: 8,500 to 6,000 B.P. would be around 6550 B.C.E. to 4950 B.C.E. That's way before the Indus Valley Civilization existed.\n\nSo, between options C and D, D is too early, and A and B are too late. So, C seems the most plausible.\n\nBut let me double-check. Mohenjo-daro was at its peak during the Mature Harappan period, which was from around 2600 BCE to 1900 BCE. Option C gives 4,500 to 4,000 B.P., which is around 2550 B.C.E. to 1950 B.C.E., which overlaps with the Mature Harappan period.\n\nOption C also mentions the Mature Harappan period, which aligns with what I recall about Mohenjo-daro's development.\n\nOption D is during the Early Harappan period, which was a precursor to the Mature Harappan period. Mohenjo-daro didn't reach its complexity and urbanization until the Mature Harappan period.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. During the Mature Harappan period, from 4,500 to 4,000 B.P.\n\nI think that's the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
