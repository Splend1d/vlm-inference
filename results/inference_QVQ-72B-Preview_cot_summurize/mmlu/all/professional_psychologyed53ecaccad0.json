                    "text": "So I have this question here about PKU, which I believe stands for Phenylketonuria. It's a genetic disorder, right? The question says that the mental retardation associated with PKU is preventable with... and then there are four options: A. removal of environmental toxins, B. blood transfusions, C. a special diet, D. antibiotics.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what PKU is and how it causes mental retardation. I think it's a metabolic disorder where the body can't break down phenylalanine properly because of a defect in the enzyme that converts it to tyrosine. So, phenylalanine builds up in the body, and that can be toxic to the brain, leading to mental retardation.\n\nNow, the question is about preventing this mental retardation. Since it's a genetic disorder, I don't think there's a cure, but maybe it can be managed to prevent the complications.\n\nOption A is removal of environmental toxins. While it's generally healthy to avoid environmental toxins, I don't think that specifically addresses the issue in PKU. The problem is with the metabolism of phenylalanine, which is found in food, not necessarily in environmental toxins.\n\nOption B is blood transfusions. Hmm, blood transfusions are typically used to treat anemia or other blood disorders. I don't see how they would help with PKU or prevent mental retardation in this context.\n\nOption C is a special diet. This sounds plausible. If the issue is that the body can't process phenylalanine, maybe restricting its intake in the diet could prevent the buildup that causes problems.\n\nOption D is antibiotics. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections. Unless there's some connection between bacterial infections and PKU that I'm not aware of, I don't think antibiotics would prevent the mental retardation associated with PKU.\n\nLet me think more about the special diet option. I recall that in some metabolic disorders, managing the diet can help control the levels of the substances that build up. For example, in PKU, a diet low in phenylalanine might help prevent its accumulation.\n\nI should also consider if there are any medications or other treatments that could help, but the options provided don't include medication.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up some information about PKU to confirm my understanding.\n\nOkay, I found that PKU is indeed a genetic disorder that affects the metabolism of phenylalanine. People with PKU lack the enzyme needed to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine, so phenylalanine builds up in the blood and can be toxic to the brain, leading to intellectual disability and other health problems.\n\nTreatment for PKU typically involves a special diet that is low in phenylalanine. This diet is usually started soon after birth to prevent the buildup of phenylalanine and to protect the brain from damage.\n\nSo, based on this information, option C, a special diet, seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other options could also be part of the treatment or prevention.\n\nOption A, removal of environmental toxins: While maintaining a healthy environment is important for overall health, it doesn't specifically address the metabolic issue in PKU.\n\nOption B, blood transfusions: These are not relevant to the metabolic process of phenylalanine and wouldn't help in preventing the mental retardation caused by PKU.\n\nOption D, antibiotics: These are used to treat infections, which are not directly related to the metabolic defect in PKU.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate and effective way to prevent the mental retardation associated with PKU is through a special diet that restricts phenylalanine intake.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
