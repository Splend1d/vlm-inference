Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that exponents mean repeated multiplication. So, 5\u00b3 means 5 multiplied by itself three times. That is, 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5. I think I can do this mentally.\n\nLet me calculate 5 \u00d7 5. That's 25. Then, multiply that by another 5. So, 25 \u00d7 5. Hmm, 25 times 5 is 125.\n\nWait, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using properties of exponents or something, but no, it's pretty straightforward. It's just 5 cubed.\n\nLet me double-check. I know that 5\u00b2 is 25, and 5\u00b3 is 125. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I'll use a calculator to confirm. Yep, typing in 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 gives me 125.\n\nAlright, so the answer should be 125. Looking at the options:\n\nA. 15\n\nB. 125\n\nC. 8\n\nD. 53\n\nSo, clearly, option B is 125. But just to make sure, let's consider if there's any other interpretation of the question.\n\n\"Simplify 5\u00b3.\" That should just be straightforward calculation. No tricks here, I think.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if it's asking for something else, but no, it's pretty clear.\n\nOkay, I'm confident that the answer is 125.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{125} \\]"
