                    "text": "So I need to figure out how many different possible committees of 5 people can be chosen from a group of 15 people. The options are 75, 120, 225, and 3,003. Hmm, I think this is a combination problem because the order in which the people are chosen doesn't matter.\n\nI remember that combinations are used when you have a group of items and you want to choose a smaller group from them, and the order doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n is 15 and k is 5. So, C(15, 5) = 15! / (5!(15 - 5)! ) = 15! / (5!10!).\n\nBut calculating 15! directly seems messy. Let me see if I can simplify this. I know that 15! is 15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10!, so C(15, 5) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10!) / (5! \u00d7 10!).\n\nThe 10! cancels out, so it's (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11) / (5!).\n\nNow, 5! is 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, which is 120.\n\nSo, C(15, 5) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11) / 120.\n\nLet me calculate the numerator first: 15 \u00d7 14 is 210, times 13 is 2730, times 12 is 32760, and times 11 is 360360.\n\nThen, divide that by 120: 360360 / 120.\n\nLet me see, 120 times 3000 is 360000, and 360000 + 360 is 360360, so 3003.\n\nSo, C(15, 5) = 3,003.\n\nLooking back at the options, 3,003 is one of them.\n\nWait a minute, is there a simpler way to compute this? Maybe using smaller combinations or properties of binomial coefficients?\n\nI know that C(n, k) = C(n, n - k), so C(15, 5) = C(15, 10). But I'm not sure if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, I could use Pascal's triangle, but that would be time-consuming for larger values like 15.\n\nAnother way is to use the formula C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k). For example, C(15, 5) = C(14, 4) + C(14, 5).\n\nBut I don't know C(14, 4) or C(14, 5) off the top of my head, so that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula C(n, k) = n / k \u00d7 C(n-1, k-1).\n\nSo, C(15, 5) = (15 / 5) \u00d7 C(14, 4).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The correct formula is C(n, k) = (n / k) \u00d7 C(n-1, k-1) only if C(n-1, k-1) is known.\n\nActually, I think the correct recursive formula is C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k).\n\nBut again, without knowing those smaller combinations, it might not be helpful.\n\nGiven that, maybe sticking with the initial calculation is best.\n\nAlternatively, I could look up the combination formula in a table or use a calculator, but since this is a thought process exercise, I should try to compute it manually.\n\nLet me double-check my initial calculation.\n\nC(15, 5) = 15! / (5!10!) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10!) / (120 \u00d7 10!) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11) / 120.\n\nCalculating numerator: 15 \u00d7 14 = 210.\n\n210 \u00d7 13 = 2730.\n\n2730 \u00d7 12 = 32760.\n\n32760 \u00d7 11 = 360360.\n\nDivide by 120: 360360 / 120 = 3,003.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible committees is 3,003.\n\nSo, the answer is D. 3,003.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3003} \\]"
