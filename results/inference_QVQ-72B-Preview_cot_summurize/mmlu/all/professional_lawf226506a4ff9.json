During that period of time, it had been his regular practice to stay at a hotel in the state's capital while the legislature was in session (namely from September through March). As a general rule, the senator stayed at the hotel each and every night during that seven-month period. When the senator checked into the hotel on September 1, 2007 for the 2007 \u0080\u00942008 term, the hotel manager quoted the senator his usual senatorial discount rate of $50 per night. Although nothing was said regarding payment terms, the senator customarily paid the bill in weekly installments. During the months of September and October, he paid the hotel at the end of each week $350 plus tax and other accumulated expenses. On the last day of October, the senator made his usual weekly payment covering the rental period from October 25 to October 31. Then, on the morning of November 4 (before checkout time for that day), the senator decided to suddenly move out of the hotel and register at a new motel located two blocks away. He notified the manager at the hotel of his intent to check out and tendered a check for $150 plus tax and other incidental charges incurred from November 1 through November 3. When the manager noticed that the senator was paying only for three days, she remarked, \"You still owe us $200 plus tax for the rest of the week and $350 plus taxes for an additional week because you didn't give us a week's notice that you planned to vacate. \" The senator refused to pay the additional charges.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got a senator who's been staying at a hotel in the state capital during the legislative sessions, which run from September through March, for three years. He stays there every night during those seven months and pays $50 per night, usually in weekly installments of $350 plus tax and other expenses. This year, he checked in on September 1, 2007, and paid as usual until November 4, when he decided to switch to another motel.\n\nThe hotel manager is claiming that the senator owes them an additional $200 plus tax for the rest of the week and another $350 plus taxes because he didn't give a week's notice that he was planning to vacate. The senator refuses to pay these charges, and now the hotel is suing him for the unpaid balance.\n\nThe question is, how many additional days of lodging will the senator be required to pay for if the hotel brings suit?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the payment structure and any possible agreements or implications of the senator's sudden departure.\n\nHe pays $50 per night, and customarily pays in weekly installments of $350. That seems like $50 times 7 nights, which makes sense. He pays this amount at the end of each week, covering the past week's stay.\n\nOn October 31, he made his usual weekly payment covering October 25 to October 31. Then, on November 4, he decided to check out and move to another motel. He paid for November 1 through November 3, which is three days, but the hotel is claiming he owes for the rest of the week plus an additional week because he didn't give a week's notice.\n\nSo, let's look at the timeline:\n\n- September 1, 2007: checks in.\n\n- Pays weekly installments of $350 plus tax and other expenses, typically at the end of each week.\n\n- October 31: pays for October 25 to October 31 ($350 plus tax).\n\n- November 4: decides to check out and pays for November 1 to November 3 ($150 plus tax).\n\n- The hotel claims he owes for the rest of the week (November 4 to November 10) and an additional week because he didn't give a week's notice.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the senator is obligated to pay for the entire week of November 4 to November 10 and possibly an extra week due to the lack of notice.\n\nFirst, let's consider the payment terms. He pays at the end of each week for the previous week's stay. So, his payment on October 31 covered October 25 to October 31. Then, on November 4, he paid for November 1 to November 3, intending to check out that day.\n\nBut the hotel seems to expect payment for the entire week of November 4 to November 10, even though he checked out on November 4.\n\nIs there an implied contract or understanding that he is committed to paying for full weeks at a time, especially if he doesn't give notice to vacate?\n\nLet's think about it.\n\nHe has been staying there for three years, always paying weekly installments. It's likely that there's an understanding or an implicit contract that he will continue to stay and pay weekly unless he gives notice to vacate.\n\nHowever, there's no mention of a formal lease or contract that requires him to give a week's notice before checking out.\n\nIn many hotels, especially for long-term stays, there might be agreements in place that require guests to give notice before checking out, often to allow the hotel to prepare for new guests or to manage their occupancy better.\n\nAssuming there was no explicit agreement regarding notice for checkout, the hotel might still argue that based on past practice, the senator was expected to stay and pay weekly unless he gave notice.\n\nBut in legal terms, without a written agreement, it might be hard to enforce such expectations.\n\nHowever, considering that he has been staying there for three years with a consistent payment pattern, the hotel might argue that there is an implied contract based on past behavior.\n\nLet's consider that.\n\nIf there's an established pattern where the senator pays weekly and stays for the entire legislative session, and he suddenly decides to check out without giving notice, the hotel might argue that he is still obligated to pay for the remaining days of the week he was expected to stay.\n\nSo, from November 4 to November 10, that's seven days. He paid for three days (November 1 to 3), so the hotel is claiming he owes for the remaining four days of that week (November 4 to 7, since he checked out on November 4) plus the entire next week (November 8 to November 14), totaling 11 days.\n\nWait, but November 4 is the day he checked out, so he didn't stay from November 4 onwards.\n\nBut he paid for November 1 to 3, which is three days.\n\nIf the week runs from, say, Sunday to Saturday, and November 4 was a Monday, then the week of November 4 to November 10 would be seven days, but he paid for November 1 to 3, which might overlap depending on the hotel's checkout day.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing.\n\nLet's assume that the hotel's billing week runs from Thursday to Wednesday, which is a common practice in some places.\n\nSo, October 25 to October 31 is one week, and November 1 to November 7 is the next week.\n\nIf the senator checked out on November 4, which is within the November 1 to 7 week, and he paid for November 1 to 3, then he owes for November 4 to 7, which is four days.\n\nBut the hotel is claiming he owes for the rest of that week and an additional week because he didn't give a week's notice.\n\nSo, from November 4 to November 7 (four days) plus November 8 to November 14 (seven days), totaling 11 days.\n\nBut is this fair?\n\nWell, if there was an agreement that he needed to give a week's notice before checking out, then yes, he would owe for the remaining days of the current week and the next full week.\n\nHowever, there's no mention of such an agreement.\n\nThe hotel manager mentioned that he didn't give a week's notice, but that might just be her assumption based on past practice.\n\nPerhaps there is an implied contract due to his past behavior.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hotel operates on a policy where guests are expected to pay weekly and give notice if they plan to vacate early.\n\nBut without a written agreement, it's unclear.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, for long-term stays, there might be implied terms in the contract based on customary practices or previous dealings.\n\nGiven that the senator has been staying there for three years with a consistent pattern, the hotel might argue that there is an implied term that he will continue to stay and pay weekly unless he gives notice.\n\nTherefore, by not giving notice, he is still obligated to pay for the remaining days of the week he was expected to stay plus an additional week.\n\nSo, in this case, that would be four days from November 4 to 7 plus seven days from November 8 to 14, totaling 11 days.\n\nAlternatively, if the hotel's billing week starts on a different day, say Sunday, then the week might be from Sunday to Saturday.\n\nLet's consider that.\n\nIf the week runs from Sunday to Saturday, then:\n\n- October 28 to November 3 is one week ($350 plus tax).\n\n- November 4 to November 10 is the next week.\n\nIf the senator checked out on November 4, which is the start of the new week, and he paid for November 1 to 3, which might be part of the previous week, then he would owe for November 4 to 10, which is seven days.\n\nBut the hotel is claiming he owes $200 plus tax for the rest of the week and $350 plus taxes for an additional week because he didn't give a week's notice.\n\nSo, $200 plus tax for the rest of the week and $350 plus tax for the next week.\n\nAssuming $50 per night, $200 would be four nights, which aligns with November 4 to 7 being four days.\n\nSo, the hotel is claiming he owes for four days plus an additional week (seven days), totaling 11 days.\n\nBut is this justified?\n\nWell, if there was an understanding that he would stay for the entire legislative session or pay weekly unless he gave notice, then yes, he might owe for the remaining days of the week and the next week.\n\nHowever, without a formal agreement, it's unclear.\n\nPerhaps the court would look at the past practice and imply a term in the contract that requires him to give a week's notice before checking out.\n\nAlternatively, the court might rule that since he paid for the days he stayed and didn't give notice, he owes only for the days he didn't pay for in the current week, but not for the next week.\n\nIn that case, he might only owe for the four days from November 4 to 7.\n\nBut the hotel is claiming he owes for the rest of the week and an additional week, totaling 11 days.\n\nGiven that, and considering the past practice, it seems likely that the court would rule in favor of the hotel's claim for 11 days.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Eleven.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
