                    "text": "So I've got this question here about religious movements that were opposed to the use of holy images, based on some passages from early Christian texts. The sources are from John of Damascus around 730 C.E. and the Second Council of Nicaea in 787 C.E., both of which seem to be supporting the use of images in religious practice. The question is asking which of the given religious movements\u2014Sunni Islam, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, or Jainism\u2014was ideologically opposed to these sentiments about using holy images.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these passages are saying. John of Damascus is talking about proclaiming God through senses, especially sight, and says that images are like memorials, similar to how words are to the ear or books are to the literate. He seems to be justifying the use of images for worship and education, particularly for those who can't read.\n\nThe Second Council of Nicaea reinforces this idea, saying that they keep all ecclesiastical traditions, including making pictorial representations. They argue that these images help show that the incarnation of Jesus was real and not just a fantasy, emphasizing the physical reality of God becoming human.\n\nSo, both sources are in favor of using images in religious contexts, particularly in Christianity, to convey divine truths and stories.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of these four religious movements was ideologically opposed to these sentiments. That means I need to look at each one and see if their core beliefs or practices reject the use of images in religion.\n\nLet's start with Sunni Islam.\n\nSunni Islam is one of the main branches of Islam, and I know that Islam in general has had a complex relationship with imagery, especially anthropomorphic representations. There's a strong principle in Islam called Aniconism, which discourages the creation of images of divine beings or prophets to prevent idolatry. This is based on the Quranic verses that prohibit worship of idols and emphasize the uniqueness of God.\n\nHowever, interpretations vary within Islam. Some schools of thought are more permissive about using images in art, as long as they don't depict God or the prophets. But generally, Sunni Islam tends to be cautious about representational images, especially those that could be mistaken for divine figures.\n\nGiven that, it seems that Sunni Islam would be opposed to the use of holy images as described in the Christian passages, because it might lead to idolatry or misrepresentation of the divine.\n\nNext, Buddhism.\n\nBuddhism is another major world religion that has varying practices regarding images. In many Buddhist traditions, especially in East Asia and South Asia, there are numerous statues and images of the Buddha and other bodhisattvas. These images are used as focal points for meditation and reverence, but they are not worshipped in the same way that Christian icons might be.\n\nHowever, early Buddhist teachings emphasize the importance of avoiding attachment to forms and icons, and some schools, like Theravada Buddhism, place less emphasis on imagery. But overall, Buddhism has a rich tradition of iconography, and images are an integral part of its cultural and religious expression.\n\nGiven that, it seems that Buddhism is not ideologically opposed to the use of holy images; in fact, it embraces them in many of its forms.\n\nMoving on to Zoroastrianism.\n\nZoroastrianism is an ancient Persian religion founded by the prophet Zoroaster. It is based on the worship of Ahura Mazda, the God of Wisdom, and emphasizes dualistic principles between good and evil.\n\nIn Zoroastrianism, there is a tradition of using symbols and icons to represent spiritual concepts, such as the Faravahar, which is a prominent symbol representing good thoughts, good words, and good deeds. However, there isn't a strong tradition of using images of deities in worship.\n\nThat being said, Zoroastrianism doesn't have a strict prohibition against images like some other religions do. While they don't use images of deities in worship, they do use symbolic representations.\n\nSo, while Zoroastrianism doesn't use images of gods in the same way that Christianity does, it's not necessarily ideologically opposed to images per se, just to their use in worship.\n\nLastly, Jainism.\n\nJainism is an Indian religion that emphasizes non-violence and asceticism. It reveres Tirthankaras, who are spiritual teachers that have achieved enlightenment. In Jainism, idols of Tirthankaras are commonly used in temples and are objects of veneration.\n\nThese idols are not worshipped as gods but are seen as inspirations and reminders of the path to enlightenment. So, unlike some other religions that shun images, Jainism has a well-developed iconography and tradition of using statues and images in their religious practices.\n\nGiven that, Jainism clearly accepts and uses holy images in their religious life.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Sunni Islam: Generally opposed to images of divine beings to prevent idolatry.\n\n- Buddhism: Uses images extensively in many traditions.\n\n- Zoroastrianism: Uses symbols but not images of deities in worship.\n\n- Jainism: Uses images of Tirthankaras as objects of veneration.\n\nComparing these, Sunni Islam is the one that aligns most closely with being ideologically opposed to the use of holy images, as described in the Christian passages.\n\nMoreover, considering the historical context, around the 8th century C.E., when these Christian texts were written, Islam was a rising power in the Middle East and North Africa, and there was significant interaction and conflict between Christian and Muslim rulers. This context might make the comparison between Christianity and Islam particularly relevant.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Sunni Islam.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
