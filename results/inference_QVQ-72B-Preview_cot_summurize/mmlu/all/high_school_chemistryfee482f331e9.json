                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about diluting a stock solution of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) to make a smaller concentration. The starting solution is 18.0 M H2SO4, and I need to end up with 1.00 L of 3.0 M H2SO4 using a volumetric flask. There are four options provided, and I need to figure out which one is the correct procedure.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. Dilution is a common process in chemistry where we reduce the concentration of a solution by adding more solvent. The relationship between the initial and final concentrations and volumes is given by the dilution formula:\n\n\\[c_1 v_1 = c_2 v_2\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(c_1\\) is the initial concentration (18.0 M)\n\n- \\(v_1\\) is the initial volume (what we need to find)\n\n- \\(c_2\\) is the final concentration (3.0 M)\n\n- \\(v_2\\) is the final volume (1.00 L)\n\nI can use this formula to calculate the volume of the stock solution needed.\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n\\[18.0 \\, \\text{M} \\times v_1 = 3.0 \\, \\text{M} \\times 1.00 \\, \\text{L}\\]\n\nSolving for \\(v_1\\):\n\n\\[v_1 = \\frac{3.0 \\, \\text{M} \\times 1.00 \\, \\text{L}}{18.0 \\, \\text{M}} = \\frac{3.0}{18.0} \\, \\text{L} = 0.1667 \\, \\text{L}\\]\n\nConverting liters to milliliters:\n\n\\[0.1667 \\, \\text{L} \\times 1000 \\, \\text{mL/L} = 166.7 \\, \\text{mL}\\]\n\nSo, I need 166.7 mL of the 18.0 M H2SO4 solution to make 1.00 L of 3.0 M solution.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Add 167 mL of the stock solution to the flask, then fill the flask the rest of the way with distilled water while swirling the solution.\n\nB. Add 600 mL of the stock solution to the flask, then fill the flask the rest of the way with distilled water while swirling the solution.\n\nC. Fill the flask partway with water, then add 167 mL of the stock solution, swirling to mix it. Last, fill the flask the rest of the way with distilled water.\n\nD. Fill the flask partway with water, then add 600 mL of the stock solution, swirling to mix it. Last, fill the flask the rest of the way with distilled water.\n\nFrom the calculation, I know that 166.7 mL (which rounds to 167 mL) of the stock solution is needed, so options A and C suggest the correct volume, while B and D suggest 600 mL, which is incorrect.\n\nNow, between options A and C, what's the difference?\n\nOption A suggests adding the stock solution first and then adding water to the flask.\n\nOption C suggests filling the flask partway with water first, then adding the stock solution, and finally adding more water to reach the final volume.\n\nI need to recall the proper technique for using a volumetric flask.\n\nVolumetric flasks are designed to hold a precise volume when filled to the calibration mark. When preparing a solution of a specific concentration, it's important to ensure that the solvent and solute are thoroughly mixed and that the final volume is accurately measured.\n\nIn option A, adding the stock solution first and then filling with water might lead to issues if the stock solution doesn't mix completely before reaching the final volume. However, given that the flask is being swirled during the filling process, this might help mix the solution.\n\nIn option C, filling the flask partway with water first helps to dissipate the heat of dilution and ensures that the stock solution is mixed with water from the start, which is especially important if the stock solution is concentrated and could affect the flask's integrity or the accuracy of the final volume.\n\nGiven that H2SO4 is a strong acid and its concentrated forms can generate a lot of heat when diluted with water, it's crucial to dilute it carefully to avoid splattering or boiling. The standard procedure for diluting concentrated acids involves adding the acid to water, not vice versa, to minimize the risk of splashes due to the exothermic reaction.\n\nTherefore, option C seems safer and more accurate because it involves adding the stock solution to water, ensuring better mixing and heat dissipation.\n\nOption D suggests adding 600 mL of the stock solution, which is incorrect based on the calculation.\n\nOption B suggests adding 600 mL of the stock solution, which is also incorrect.\n\nSo, between A and C, C seems preferable due to the initial addition of water, which helps in safely diluting the concentrated acid.\n\nHowever, in practice, when using a volumetric flask, it's important to avoid adding too much water before adding the stock solution because the flask has a specific calibration mark for the final volume. Adding too much water initially could lead to overflow or difficulty in accurately reaching the final volume.\n\nIn option C, it says to fill the flask partway with water, but doesn't specify how much. If \"partway\" means filling up to, say, 70-80% of the flask's capacity, that might be too much for accurate final volume adjustment.\n\nIn contrast, option A suggests adding the stock solution first and then filling the flask with water to the calibration mark, which is a common procedure in laboratories for preparing dilute solutions from concentrated ones.\n\nGiven that, option A seems equally valid, provided that the stock solution is mixed thoroughly with water during the filling process to ensure even dilution.\n\nBut considering the exothermic nature of diluting sulfuric acid, it might be safer to add the acid to water, as in option C, to better manage the heat generated during the dilution process.\n\nHowever, in the context of using a volumetric flask, which is typically not very large, adding a significant amount of water before the stock solution could make it challenging to measure the final volume accurately, especially if \"partway\" involves adding a substantial portion of the final volume.\n\nTo reconcile these considerations, perhaps the best approach is to add a small amount of water to the volumetric flask first, say 100-200 mL, then add the stock solution (167 mL), and then add more water to reach the 1.00 L mark, ensuring that the solution is swirled to mix properly throughout the process.\n\nThis would combine the safety of diluting the concentrated acid with water and the accuracy of measuring the final volume in the flask.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C describes filling the flask partway with water, adding the stock solution, and then filling the rest of the way with water, which aligns with this approach.\n\nOption A suggests adding the stock solution first and then filling with water, which might be less safe due to the heat of dilution if the stock solution is added to a dry flask.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the most appropriate and safe procedure.\n\nTo summarize, the correct procedure is:\n\n- Fill the flask partway with distilled water (e.g., 200 mL)\n\n- Add 167 mL of the 18.0 M H2SO4 stock solution\n\n- Swirl to mix\n\n- Add more distilled water to reach the 1.00 L mark\n\n- Invert the flask several times to ensure thorough mixing\n\nThis ensures both safety and accuracy in preparing the desired 3.0 M H2SO4 solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
