Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what the range of a function is. The range is all the possible output values of the function, right? So, in other words, it's all the possible y-values that the function can take for any real x, except where the function is undefined.\n\nLooking at the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 - x} \\), I see that it's a rational function, which means it's a fraction with x in the denominator. I know that the denominator can't be zero because that would make the function undefined. So, I should find out for which x-values the denominator is zero and exclude those from the domain.\n\nLet's set the denominator equal to zero:\n\n\\( 1 - x = 0 \\)\n\n\\( x = 1 \\)\n\nSo, the function is undefined when x = 1. That means x can be any real number except 1. But wait, I'm supposed to find the range, not the domain. So, I need to find all possible y-values.\n\nMaybe I can try to express this differently. Let's solve for x in terms of y. If I set y = f(x), then:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{1}{1 - x} \\)\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n\\( y(1 - x) = 1 \\)\n\n\\( y - yx = 1 \\)\n\n\\( y - 1 = yx \\)\n\n\\( x = \\frac{y - 1}{y} \\)\n\nHmm, so for every y except y = 0, this should give a real x. Wait, if y = 0, then x would be undefined because you can't divide by zero. So, y cannot be zero.\n\nBut let's think about this. If y is any real number except zero, then x is defined. So, does that mean that y can be any real number except zero?\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option B is (-\u221e, 0) \u222a (0, \u221e), which would be all real numbers except zero. That seems to align with what I just found.\n\nBut let's double-check. Suppose y is a very large positive number. Then, x would be close to 1, but not exactly 1. Similarly, if y is a very large negative number, x would be close to 1 from the other side. Wait, no, actually, as y approaches zero from the positive side, x would approach infinity or negative infinity, depending on the sign.\n\nMaybe I should think about the behavior of the function as x approaches certain values.\n\nLet's consider the behavior as x approaches 1 from the left and from the right.\n\nAs \\( x \\to 1^- \\), \\( f(x) \\to +\\infty \\)\n\nAs \\( x \\to 1^+ \\), \\( f(x) \\to -\\infty \\)\n\nSo, the function has a vertical asymptote at x = 1, and as x approaches 1 from the left, y goes to positive infinity, and from the right, y goes to negative infinity.\n\nAlso, what happens when x approaches positive or negative infinity?\n\nAs \\( x \\to +\\infty \\), \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 - x} \\to 0 \\) from below, since the denominator becomes negative and large in magnitude.\n\nAs \\( x \\to -\\infty \\), \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 - x} \\to 0 \\) from above, since the denominator becomes positive and large in magnitude.\n\nSo, y approaches zero but never actually reaches it.\n\nTherefore, y can be any real number except zero.\n\nSo, the range should be all real numbers except zero, which is option B: (-\u221e, 0) \u222a (0, \u221e).\n\nLet me see if there's another way to think about this. Maybe by graphing the function.\n\nI know that the graph of \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\) is a hyperbola with horizontal and vertical asymptotes at y = 0 and x = 0, respectively.\n\nMy function is \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 - x} = -\\frac{1}{x - 1} \\). So, it's like shifting the graph of \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\ ) to the right by 1 unit and reflecting it over the x-axis.\n\nSo, the vertical asymptote moves to x = 1, and the horizontal asymptote remains at y = 0.\n\nTherefore, the function approaches positive infinity as x approaches 1 from the left, negative infinity as x approaches 1 from the right, and approaches zero as x goes to positive or negative infinity.\n\nSo, again, y can be any real number except zero.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the inverse function. If I solve for x in terms of y, as I did earlier:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{y - 1}{y} = 1 - \\frac{1}{y} \\)\n\nThis expression is defined for all y except y = 0, since division by zero is undefined.\n\nTherefore, for every y \u2260 0, there is a corresponding x that satisfies the equation, and for y = 0, there is no such x.\n\nHence, the range of f(x) is all real numbers except zero.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. (-\u221e, -1) \u222a (1, \u221e)\n\nB. (-\u221e, 0) \u222a (0, \u221e)\n\nC. [-1, 1]\n\nD. (-1, 1)\n\nOption B matches our conclusion.\n\nLet's quickly check why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A: (-\u221e, -1) \u222a (1, \u221e). This suggests that y cannot be between -1 and 1, which is not the case, as we've seen that y can approach zero arbitrarily closely.\n\nOption C: [-1, 1]. This would mean y is bounded between -1 and 1, inclusive. But we've seen that y can be any real number except zero, so this is incorrect.\n\nOption D: (-1, 1). Similar to option C, this would restrict y to be between -1 and 1, exclusive, which doesn't align with our findings.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: (-\u221e, 0) \u222a (0, \u221e).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
