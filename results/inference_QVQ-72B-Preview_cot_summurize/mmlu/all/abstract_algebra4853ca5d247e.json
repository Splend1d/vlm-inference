                    "text": "So I've got this problem here with two statements about group theory. I'm not super confident with groups yet, but I'll try to work through this step by step.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: \"If a and b are elements of a group and a is not equal to b, then a\u00b2 is not equal to b\u00b2.\"\n\nHmm, that seems a bit tricky. So, in a group, we have elements and an operation that combines them. The operation is associative, there's an identity element, and every element has an inverse. But here, we're dealing with squares of elements.\n\nLet me think about this. If a and b are different elements, does that necessarily mean that a squared is different from b squared? I don't think so. Maybe I can find a counterexample where two different elements square to the same thing.\n\nConsider the group of integers modulo 4 under addition. Let's see, elements are 0, 1, 2, 3. Squaring here would mean adding an element to itself. So, 1 + 1 = 2, 2 + 2 = 0, 3 + 3 = 2. Wait, 1 + 1 = 2 and 3 + 3 = 2. So, 1 and 3 are different elements, but their squares are both 2. Does that count?\n\nWait, but the operation in additive groups is usually written as addition, not exponentiation. Maybe I should think in terms of multiplicative groups.\n\nLet's try the multiplicative group modulo 5, which consists of {1, 2, 3, 4}. Squaring each element: 1\u00b2 = 1, 2\u00b2 = 4, 3\u00b2 = 9 \u2261 4 mod 5, 4\u00b2 = 16 \u2261 1 mod 5. So, 1 and 4 square to the same thing, as do 2 and 3. So, here, 1 \u2260 4 but 1\u00b2 = 4\u00b2 = 1.\n\nAnother example: the symmetric group S3. Let's pick two different elements and see if their squares are equal.\n\nIn S3, elements are the identity e, (12), (13), (23), (123), and (132). Let's take (12) and (13). (12)\u00b2 = (12)(12) = e, and (13)\u00b2 = (13)(13) = e. So, (12) \u2260 (13), but (12)\u00b2 = (13)\u00b2 = e.\n\nWait a minute, in all these examples, I'm finding pairs of different elements that square to the same thing. Does that mean Statement 1 is false? It seems like it might be false, because in these groups, there are cases where a \u2260 b but a\u00b2 = b\u00b2.\n\nBut maybe there are groups where this doesn't happen. For example, in the group of integers under addition, if a \u2260 b, then a + a \u2260 b + b, because addition is just doubling. So, in that case, a\u00b2 \u2260 b\u00b2 if a \u2260 b. But in other groups, like modulo groups or permutation groups, it's possible to have different elements squaring to the same thing.\n\nSo, based on these examples, Statement 1 seems to be false. But to be sure, maybe I should recall some group theory properties.\n\nI remember that in group theory, the order of an element is important. Also, in abelian groups, the operation commutes, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2: \"The set of rotations in a dihedral group form a cyclic subgroup.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a dihedral group is. The dihedral group D_n (sometimes denoted D_{2n}) consists of the symmetries of a regular n-gon, which include rotations and reflections.\n\nSo, for D_n, the elements are rotations and reflections. Rotations are given by powers of a rotation by 2\u03c0/n radians, and reflections are across axes through vertices or midpoints.\n\nThe set of rotations in D_n is {r^k | k = 0, 1, ..., n-1}, where r is the rotation by 2\u03c0/n radians.\n\nNow, is this set of rotations a cyclic subgroup? A cyclic group is generated by a single element, and a subgroup is cyclic if it's generated by one of its elements.\n\nIn this case, the rotations are generated by r, since any rotation can be obtained by some power of r. So, the set of rotations is indeed cyclic, generated by r.\n\nWait, but is this always true? Let's think about D_3, the symmetries of an equilateral triangle. The rotations are the identity and rotations by 120 and 240 degrees. The identity is r^0, 120 is r^1, and 240 is r^2. So, all rotations are powers of r, hence it's cyclic.\n\nSimilarly, in D_4, rotations are 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees, which are r^0, r^1, r^2, r^3, generated by r = rotation by 90 degrees.\n\nIt seems like this holds for any n. So, Statement 2 is true.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is true. So, the answer should be D. False, True.\n\nBut to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nFor Statement 1, I found counterexamples in several groups where a \u2260 b but a\u00b2 = b\u00b2, so it's not always true.\n\nFor Statement 2, in dihedral groups, the set of rotations is indeed a cyclic subgroup, generated by a single rotation.\n\nYes, I think my conclusion is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
