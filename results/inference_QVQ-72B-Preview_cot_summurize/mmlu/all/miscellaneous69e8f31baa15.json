Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that 'Spinning' is a type of indoor cycling class. It's pretty popular in gyms and fitness centers. So, based on that, I'm thinking that the main equipment used in these classes is probably a stationary bicycle. But just to be sure, I should consider each option.\n\nLet's start with the stationary bicycle. These are bikes that you pedal without going anywhere, right? They're great for cardio workouts and can be adjusted for different resistance levels. 'Spinning' classes often involve varying intensities, like sprints and climbs, which would make sense with a stationary bike.\n\nNext, there's the treadmill. Treadmills are for walking or running in place. While they're also good for cardio, I don't think they're typically used in 'Spinning' classes. 'Spinning' is more associated with cycling, not running.\n\nThen there's the rowing machine. This piece of equipment is used for simulating the motion of rowing a boat. It works both the arms and legs, which is different from 'Spinning,' which primarily focuses on the legs. So, I don't think rowing machines are used in 'Spinning' classes.\n\nLastly, there are barbells. Barbells are weights with bars on either end, commonly used for strength training exercises like lifts and presses. 'Spinning' classes are more about cardiovascular exercise and less about weightlifting, so barbells probably aren't the main apparatus used in these classes.\n\nPutting it all together, it seems pretty clear that the stationary bicycle is the exercise apparatus used in 'Spinning' classes. The other options\u2014treadmill, rowing machine, and barbells\u2014don't align with the type of activity that 'Spinning' involves.\n\nJust to double-check, I recall that 'Spinning' classes often incorporate techniques from outdoor cycling, like standing while pedaling or simulating hills by increasing resistance. All of these techniques are specific to cycling and would require a stationary bicycle as the primary equipment.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is A. stationary bicycle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ stationary bicycle}} \\]"
