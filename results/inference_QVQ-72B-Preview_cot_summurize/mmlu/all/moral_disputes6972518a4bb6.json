                    "text": " So I'm trying to understand this question about Carruthers and his views on moral standing for nonhuman animals from a contractualist perspective. The options are direct, indirect, quasi-, or none of the above. I need to figure out which one Carruthers would support.\n\nFirst off, I should probably know what contractualism is. From what I recall, contractualism is a moral theory that emphasizes agreements or contracts between rational beings to determine moral principles. It's about what kind of social contracts we would agree to under certain ideal conditions.\n\nNow, Carruthers is known for his work in animal ethics. He has arguments about whether animals have moral standing or not. Moral standing refers to the idea that something is worthy of moral consideration and can be a bearer of rights or duties.\n\nThe question is specifically about nonhuman animals, so we're dealing with animals other than humans.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. direct\n\nB. indirect\n\nC. quasi-\n\nD. none of the above\n\nI think in this context, \"direct\" moral standing would mean that animals have moral worth in their own right, independent of any benefits they might provide to humans. \"Indirect\" moral standing might imply that animals have moral significance only because of their relationship to humans or because of how treating them affects humans. \"Quasi-\" might suggest some partial or limited form of moral standing, not fully equal to that of humans. And \"none of the above\" would mean that according to Carruthers, animals don't have any moral standing at all from a contractualist standpoint.\n\nI remember that Carruthers has been criticized for his views on animal consciousness and moral status. He might be someone who doesn't grant animals full moral standing, but perhaps he allows for some form of indirect or quasi-moral standing.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully.\n\nContractualism often involves considering the interests of all affected parties, including animals if they are considered to have interests. So, if animals have interests, they might have some moral standing in the contractualist framework.\n\nBut what does Carruthers say about this? I need to recall his specific arguments.\n\nI think Carruthers argues that only beings capable of rationality and self-reflection can be parties to a social contract. Since nonhuman animals lack these capacities, they can't be full participants in the contractual agreement.\n\nGiven that, it seems like he might not grant animals direct moral standing. But perhaps they still have some moral consideration based on their ability to feel pain or something like that.\n\nWait, maybe he thinks that while animals don't have direct moral standing, their welfare is still something that rational contractors would care about, hence indirect moral standing.\n\nThat sounds plausible. So, in that case, the answer would be B. indirect.\n\nBut let's see if there's more to it. Maybe he has a more nuanced view.\n\nI recall that some philosophers argue that animals have quasi-moral standing, meaning they have some moral significance but not full moral rights. If Carruthers holds this view, then C. quasi- might be the correct answer.\n\nHowever, I think his position is more aligned with indirect moral standing. He might argue that while animals don't have intrinsic value or direct moral standing, their treatment affects the well-being of rational beings (humans), who do have moral standing.\n\nLet me consider this example: if harming animals causes suffering to humans who care about animals, then protecting animals indirectly serves the interests of humans. Thus, from a contractualist perspective, rational contractors would include animal welfare in their moral considerations, not for the animals' sake directly, but because it affects human well-being.\n\nThat seems consistent with indirect moral standing.\n\nOn the other hand, if Carruthers believed that animals have their own intrinsic interests that deserve moral consideration regardless of human interests, that would be direct moral standing, which I don't think is his view.\n\nQuasi-moral standing seems like a middle ground, but I'm not sure about the specifics of Carruthers' position there.\n\nPerhaps I should look up some of his quotes or key arguments to confirm.\n\nI found that Carruthers argues that only beings who can endorse or criticize moral principles can be full moral agents with direct moral standing. Since animals lack the capacity for such rational reflection, they cannot be moral agents and thus don't have direct moral standing.\n\nHowever, he might still grant that animals have interests based on their ability to feel pain and pleasure, and that these interests should be considered indirectly through the impact on human moral agents.\n\nSo, again, this points towards indirect moral standing.\n\nAlternatively, he might argue that animals have quasi-moral standing, meaning they have some moral consideration but not full moral rights. But I think his position is more towards indirect moral standing.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose that in a contractualist framework, the rational contractors are only humans, and they agree to consider the welfare of animals not for the animals' sake directly, but because it aligns with human values or because it's in humans' long-term interests.\n\nThat would be a case of indirect moral standing for animals.\n\nAlternatively, if the contractors grant animals moral consideration because they can suffer, that might be seen as direct moral standing.\n\nBut again, given Carruthers' emphasis on rationality and self-reflection as criteria for moral agency, it's unlikely that he would grant animals direct moral standing.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is B. indirect.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check if there's any mention of Carruthers supporting quasi-moral standing or some other view.\n\nFrom what I can find, Carruthers does recognize that animals can feel pain and have interests, but he doesn't grant them full moral standing because they lack rationality and self-awareness.\n\nSo, he likely supports indirect moral standing for animals in a contractualist framework.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. indirect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
