                    "text": "So I have this question about Harlow's study on baby monkeys reared by artificial mothers, and it's asking about the implications of this study for humans. There are three statements labeled I, II, and III, and I need to pick which ones are correct based on the study's findings.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Harlow's study was about. I remember that Harry Harlow conducted experiments in the 1950s and 1960s where he raised baby rhesus monkeys with surrogate mothers made of wire and cloth to study attachment and emotional development.\n\nIn his famous \"mothering\" experiment, he presented baby monkeys with two artificial mothers: one was just a wire frame with a wooden head and a feeding bottle, and the other was the same wire frame but covered with terry cloth, making it softer and more cuddly.\n\nHarlow observed that the babies spent most of their time with the cloth mother, even when they were fed by the wire mother. This suggested that comfort and contact comfort were more important for attachment than just providing food.\n\nNow, let's look at the three statements:\n\nI. Human infants form attachments based primarily on the provision of food.\n\nBut Harlow's study showed that in monkeys, attachment was more about contact comfort than about food. So, if monkeys prefer the cloth mother for comfort over the wire mother that provides food, it suggests that for humans, who are similarly social creatures, attachment might not be primarily based on food provision either. Maybe this implies that human infants also form attachments based on comfort and emotional bonding rather than just feeding.\n\nWait, but I know that in human infants, feeding is often associated with cuddling and bonding, so perhaps it's a combination. But according to Harlow's monkey studies, comfort seems more important than food.\n\nII. Human infants require physical comfort and contact to develop healthy attachments.\n\nThis seems directly aligned with Harlow's findings. Since the baby monkeys preferred the cloth mother for comfort, it suggests that physical comfort and contact are crucial for healthy attachment. Humans are also social beings, so it makes sense that we would have similar needs for physical comfort and contact to form healthy attachments.\n\nIII. Lack of physical comfort and contact can lead to developmental issues in human infants.\n\nAgain, based on Harlow's studies, baby monkeys that lacked a comforting mother figure showed various developmental problems, including difficulties in forming social bonds, anxiety, and sometimes aggression. So, extrapolating to humans, it's reasonable to think that lack of physical comfort and contact could lead to similar developmental issues.\n\nBut, I should consider that monkeys and humans are different, and direct extrapolation might not be entirely accurate. However, since both are primates and share many social behaviors, the implications are likely similar.\n\nSo, considering these points, it seems that all three statements I, II, and III could be implied from Harlow's study of baby monkeys.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is asking for the implications for humans from this study. Maybe there's a trick here, and not all three are necessarily supported directly by the study.\n\nLet me think again. Harlow's study showed that in monkeys, attachment is more about comfort than food. It didn't directly study humans, but his work had a significant impact on understanding human attachment, especially in the context of orphanages and institutional care, where children might lack physical comfort and contact.\n\nIn fact, his research contributed to the understanding that children need nurturing and physical contact for healthy emotional development, which aligns with statement II.\n\nFurthermore, studies have shown that children who lack physical comfort and contact, such as those in overcrowded orphanages, can experience developmental delays and attachment disorders, which supports statement III.\n\nAs for statement I, Harlow's work suggests that attachment isn't primarily about food, but about comfort and emotional bonding, which would contradict the idea that human infants form attachments based primarily on food provision.\n\nHowever, in reality, human infants do associate feeding with comfort and bonding because caregivers often provide both food and affection during feedings. So, perhaps in humans, attachment is based on a combination of factors, including comfort and feeding.\n\nBut based on Harlow's monkey studies, which emphasized the importance of contact comfort over food, it would imply that comfort is more important than food in forming attachments.\n\nSo, if I consider only what can be implied directly from Harlow's monkey studies to humans, I would say that statements II and III are supported by his findings.\n\nStatement I, on the other hand, seems contradicted by Harlow's findings, since the monkeys preferred the cloth mother for comfort over the wire mother that provided food.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer might be D. I and II only, but actually, if I think about it, I should only select the ones that are directly implied from the study.\n\nWait, but D. I and II only \u2013 if I select that, but I think that I is not directly implied from the study because the study suggests that comfort is more important than food, which would contradict I.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is B. II only.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right either, because III is also supported by the study's implications.\n\nWait, maybe C. III only.\n\nBut both II and III seem supported.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all three are supported, but maybe the question is testing whether I recognize that human attachment is more complex than just monkeys', and that while II and III are supported, I is not, because in humans, attachment is based on both comfort and feeding, not just one or the other.\n\nBut Harlow's study suggests that comfort is more important than feeding, so perhaps in humans, it's similar, meaning that attachment is based more on comfort than feeding, but feeding is still a part of the bonding process.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should look for a standard answer or see how this question is typically interpreted.\n\nUpon checking, I find that Harlow's work indeed emphasized the importance of contact comfort over nourishment in the formation of attachments in infants. His studies led to a greater understanding of the emotional needs of children and influenced changes in childcare practices, such as allowing parents more contact with their babies in hospitals and improving conditions in orphanages.\n\nGiven this context, it's clear that Harlow's work implies that human infants require physical comfort and contact to develop healthy attachments (II), and that lack of such comfort and contact can lead to developmental issues (III).\n\nAs for statement I, Harlow's findings suggest that attachment is not primarily based on the provision of food, at least in monkeys, and by extension, possibly in humans as well. Therefore, statement I seems to contradict Harlow's main findings.\n\nThus, the correct answer should be D. I and II only \u2013 wait, no. If statement I is not supported by Harlow's study, then I shouldn't select it.\n\nSo, the correct choice is B. II only, but that seems incomplete because III is also a valid implication from the study.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is C. III only, but that seems too narrow.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is D. I and II only, but I'm still unsure because I think III is also supported.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The question is asking for implications of Harlow's study for humans, and based on his findings in monkeys, it's reasonable to infer that human infants require physical comfort and contact for healthy attachment (II), and that lack of it can lead to developmental issues (III).\n\nStatement I, however, seems to be contradicted by Harlow's findings, as his study showed that attachment is more about comfort than food.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be statements II and III, but looking back at the options, there is no option for II and III only.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. II only\n\nC. III only\n\nD. I and II only\n\nGiven this, perhaps the answer is D. I and II only, but I'm not entirely sure because I think III is also a valid implication.\n\nWait, maybe the question has a typo, and there should be an option for II and III only.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects that only II is directly implied, and III is a stretch, or that I is partially true but not fully aligned with Harlow's findings.\n\nConsidering that, maybe B. II only is the correct answer.\n\nBut I still think that III is a valid implication, as Harlow's studies showed negative outcomes in monkeys deprived of comfort, and similar effects are seen in humans.\n\nPerhaps I need to choose the most directly supported implications, which would be II, and possibly III, but since III isn't an option in combination with II, maybe I have to settle for B. II only.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is C. III only, but that seems incomplete.\n\nI think the best answer is B. II only, acknowledging that physical comfort and contact are essential for healthy attachment in human infants, which is directly supported by Harlow's findings in monkeys.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nB. II only"
