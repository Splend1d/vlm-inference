The principles that govern inheritance traits were described less than 150 years ago. Furthermore, around the turn of the twentieth century, the laws of inheritance were rediscovered. But even then, the importance of DNA was not really understood until the 1950s.\"\n\nAlright, so it's talking about the history of genetics. It says genetics is a young science, and it gives some milestones: principles of inheritance traits were described less than 150 years ago, laws of inheritance were rediscovered around the turn of the twentieth century, and the importance of DNA wasn't really understood until the 1950s.\n\nNow, the options are:\n\nA. But even then, the importance of DNA was not really understood until the 1950s.\n\nB. The importance of DNA was not really understood until the 1950s.\n\nC. From a historical point of view, genetics is a young science.\n\nD. The principles that govern inheritance traits were described less than 150 years ago.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which one of these is the conclusion. Let me think about what a conclusion is. In an argument, the conclusion is the main point the author is trying to prove or the final assertion they are making based on the premises provided.\n\nSo, in this passage, the author is discussing the history of genetics and highlighting key events that shaped our understanding of genetics. The first sentence says genetics is a young science from a historical perspective. Then it provides specifics: the principles of inheritance were described less than 150 years ago, the laws were rediscovered around the turn of the twentieth century, and finally, the significance of DNA wasn't understood until the 1950s.\n\nNow, is the conclusion that genetics is a young science, or is it about the understanding of DNA?\n\nOption C says genetics is a young science, which is the first sentence and could be the main point, but let's see.\n\nOption D is about the principles of inheritance being described less than 150 years ago, which is a premise supporting the idea that genetics is a young field.\n\nOption A is \"But even then, the importance of DNA was not really understood until the 1950s.\" This seems to be adding another layer to the argument, emphasizing that even after the laws of inheritance were known, the role of DNA wasn't fully grasped until much later.\n\nOption B is similar to option A but without the introductory \"But even then.\" It directly states that the importance of DNA wasn't understood until the 1950s.\n\nI think the conclusion is option B: The importance of DNA was not really understood until the 1950s.\n\nWait, but option A includes \"But even then,\" which seems to provide context, but the main assertion is still about the understanding of DNA in the 1950s.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the argument:\n\n- Premise 1: Genetics is a young science.\n\n- Premise 2: Principles of inheritance were described less than 150 years ago.\n\n- Premise 3: Laws of inheritance were rediscovered around the turn of the twentieth century.\n\n- Premise 4: The importance of DNA was not really understood until the 1950s.\n\nSo, all these points together build up to the idea that our understanding of genetics has developed over time, with key realizations happening relatively recently, especially regarding DNA.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion could be that the understanding of DNA was not really until the 1950s, which is option B.\n\nOption A is similar but includes \"But even then,\" which might be adding emphasis, but the core statement is the same as in option B.\n\nOption C is the initial statement that genetics is a young science, which could be a premise or a general introduction to the topic.\n\nOption D is another specific point about when the principles of inheritance were described.\n\nSo, between options B and A, option B seems more straightforward as it directly states the main point without the introductory phrase.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the conclusion is option C, that genetics is a young science, and the subsequent points are supporting that conclusion.\n\nBut, considering the flow of the argument, it seems like the author is building up to the point about DNA understanding in the 1950s, which is a specific and significant advancement in the field of genetics.\n\nTherefore, I think option B is the conclusion: The importance of DNA was not really understood until the 1950s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
