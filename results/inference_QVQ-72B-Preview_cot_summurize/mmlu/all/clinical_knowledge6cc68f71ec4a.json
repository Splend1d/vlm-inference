                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question about why women's world record performances have improved so much recently. The options are:\n\nA. Women have evolved a greater muscle mass.\n\nB. Women can now run faster than men.\n\nC. Women have started training at an earlier age.\n\nD. More women are now engaged in sport.\n\nHmm, I need to think about this carefully.\n\nFirst, option A says women have evolved a greater muscle mass. Evolution is a slow process, right? It happens over many generations. I don't think significant evolutionary changes could happen in just a few years. Plus, muscle mass is something that can be developed through training and nutrition, but not necessarily through rapid evolution. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nOption B says women can now run faster than men. Well, generally, men still hold faster records in many sports. While women's performances are improving, I don't think they've surpassed men's records yet in most events. So, this might not be accurate.\n\nOption C suggests that women have started training at an earlier age. That makes sense because starting training younger can lead to better development of skills and physical abilities. Early training can help athletes reach their potential sooner and perform at higher levels at a younger age. This could contribute to improved world records.\n\nOption D says more women are now engaged in sport. This is definitely true. There's been a significant increase in female participation in sports over the years. More participants mean a larger pool of talent, which can lead to higher competition and improved performances.\n\nNow, between options C and D, which one is more directly responsible for the rapid improvement in world records?\n\nWell, having more women engaged in sports (D) certainly increases the chances of finding exceptionally talented athletes. Higher participation leads to more competition, which can drive improvements in performance.\n\nOn the other hand, starting training at an earlier age (C) allows for longer development times and potentially higher achievements.\n\nI think both factors are important, but if I had to choose one that's more impactful in recent years, I'd go with D: more women are now engaged in sport.\n\nHere's why: With increased participation, there's a broader base of athletes competing, which can lead to higher standards and faster improvement rates. Additionally, greater participation often leads to more investment in women's sports, better coaching, and improved training facilities, all of which contribute to better performances.\n\nWhile starting training early is beneficial for individual athletes, the overall improvement in world records is likely driven by a larger and more competitive participant base.\n\nSo, my answer is D. More women are now engaged in sport.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
