                    "text": "Let's see here. So, the price of beef goes up by 10%, and as a result, the quantity demanded falls by 20%. I need to figure out what this tells me about the demand for beef and what happens to consumer spending.\n\nFirst off, I remember that the price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded responds to a change in price. The formula for price elasticity is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. So, in this case, it would be -20% divided by 10%, which is -2. Since elasticity is usually talked about in absolute terms, it's 2.\n\nNow, I recall that if the elasticity is greater than 1, demand is considered price elastic. If it's less than 1, it's price inelastic. So, since 2 is greater than 1, demand for beef is price elastic. That means consumers are very responsive to price changes; when the price goes up, they buy a lot less.\n\nOkay, so options A and B say demand is price elastic, while C and D say it's price inelastic. So, based on that, A and B are possible candidates.\n\nNext, I need to figure out what happens to consumer spending on beef. Consumer spending is basically the total amount of money consumers spend on beef, which is the product of the price and the quantity demanded: spending = price \u00d7 quantity.\n\nGiven that both price and quantity have changed, I need to see how the percentage change in spending is affected by these changes.\n\nI know that the percentage change in spending can be found by adding the percentage change in price and the percentage change in quantity, but wait, that's not quite right. Actually, the percentage change in spending is the sum of the percentage change in price times the elasticity and the percentage change in quantity.\n\nLet me think again. If I have a percentage change in price and a percentage change in quantity, the percentage change in spending would be the percentage change in price multiplied by the quantity after the change plus the percentage change in quantity multiplied by the price after the change. But that seems too complicated.\n\nMaybe there's a simpler way. I know that if demand is elastic, total revenue (which is similar to spending) decreases when price increases. Conversely, if demand is inelastic, total revenue increases when price increases.\n\nGiven that demand is elastic (since elasticity is 2, which is greater than 1), increasing the price should lead to a decrease in total revenue or spending.\n\nSo, in this case, since price went up by 10% and quantity demanded fell by 20%, and elasticity is 2, which is elastic, spending should decrease.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. If elasticity is 2, that means quantity changes by 2% for every 1% change in price. So, if price increases by 10%, quantity decreases by 20%. Therefore, spending changes by the product of price and quantity.\n\nInitial spending: let's say price is $1 per unit and quantity is 100 units, so spending is $100.\n\nAfter the change, price is $1.10 and quantity is 80 units (since it decreased by 20%), so spending is $88.\n\nSo, spending decreased by $12, which is a 12% decrease.\n\nTherefore, consumer spending on beef is falling.\n\nSo, between options A and B, A says demand is price elastic and consumer spending is falling, which matches what I just calculated.\n\nOption B says demand is price elastic and consumer spending is rising, which doesn't match my calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A.\n\nWait a minute, but let me see if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using the elasticity formula again.\n\nThe elasticity is -2, which is elastic, and we know that when demand is elastic, total revenue decreases when price increases.\n\nSimilarly, when demand is inelastic, total revenue increases when price increases.\n\nSo, in this case, since demand is elastic, total revenue (or spending) decreases.\n\nTherefore, option A is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider option C: demand is price inelastic and consumer spending is falling.\n\nBut since demand is elastic, this option is incorrect.\n\nOption D: demand is price inelastic and consumer spending is rising.\n\nAgain, demand is elastic, so this is also incorrect.\n\nSo, the best answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
