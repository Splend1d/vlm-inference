                    "text": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about discontinuous change over the adult years. The options are personality, working memory, female hormone levels, and male sexuality. I need to pick which one of these experiences a discontinuous change as people age.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"discontinuous change\" means. I think it refers to changes that happen suddenly or in distinct stages, rather than gradual and continuous adjustments. So, something that has clear breakpoints or shifts at certain points in life.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with personality. I've heard that personality tends to stabilize as people get older. Like, the \"big five\" personality traits\u2014openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism\u2014show some stability over time, but there can be changes, especially in early adulthood. But I'm not sure if these changes are discontinuous. Maybe personality develops in a more continuous way, with gradual shifts rather than sudden jumps.\n\nNext, working memory. I know that working memory is important for things like problem-solving and learning new information. It's part of our short-term memory system. As people age, I think working memory capacity can decline, but again, is this decline sudden or in distinct stages, or is it more of a gradual process? I suspect it's more gradual, so maybe not a discontinuous change.\n\nNow, female hormone levels. This interests me. I know that women go through menopause typically in their late forties to mid-fifties, which is a significant change in hormone levels, especially estrogen. Before menopause, estrogen levels fluctuate with menstrual cycles, but after menopause, they drop significantly. This sounds like a pretty discontinuous change, doesn't it? A sudden shift in hormone levels rather than a smooth, gradual decline.\n\nLastly, male sexuality. I'm not as familiar with changes in male sexuality over time. I know that testosterone levels in men can decrease with age, but I think this decline is gradual, starting around age 30 and continuing slowly over time. So, similar to working memory, it seems more continuous than discontinuous.\n\nBased on this thinking, the option that stands out for discontinuous change is female hormone levels, particularly due to menopause. That seems like a clear, sudden shift in hormone levels, which fits the definition of discontinuous change.\n\nLet me double-check. Are there any other options that might also involve discontinuous changes? For personality, it seems mostly continuous with some stabilization over time. Working memory declines gradually with age, and male sexuality also appears to change continuously.\n\nSo, my best answer is C. Female hormone levels.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
