                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about heating oxygen gas from 50 \u00b0C to 100 \u00b0C, and I need to figure out which statement best describes how the gas molecules behave. The options are about changes in velocity and kinetic energy, with different factors involved. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that temperature is related to the kinetic energy of molecules. In gases, higher temperatures mean the molecules are moving faster on average. So, if we increase the temperature, the molecules should move faster, right? But by how much exactly?\n\nLet me recall the relationship between temperature and kinetic energy for ideal gases. There's a formula that connects average kinetic energy per molecule to temperature. I think it's something like \\( \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{3}{2}k_bT \\), where \\( m \\) is the mass of the molecule, \\( v \\) is its velocity, and \\( T \\) is the temperature in Kelvin. \\( k_b \\) is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nWait, but the problem is in degrees Celsius, not Kelvin. Maybe I should convert those temperatures to Kelvin first to make sure I'm using the right units. Let's do that.\n\nSo, 50 \u00b0C is \\( 50 + 273.15 = 323.15 \\) K, and 100 \u00b0C is \\( 100 + 273.15 = 373.15 \\) K. Okay, now I have temperatures in Kelvin.\n\nNow, the question is about how the velocity and kinetic energy change when the temperature increases from 323.15 K to 373.15 K.\n\nLooking at option A: their velocity increases by a factor of two. Does that make sense? If temperature is proportional to kinetic energy, and kinetic energy depends on velocity squared, then doubling velocity would quadruple kinetic energy, right? But temperature is proportional to kinetic energy, so if kinetic energy quadruples, temperature should quadruple too. But in this problem, the temperature is increasing from 323.15 K to 373.15 K, which is not quadrupling.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to think in terms of the ratio of temperatures. The ratio of the final to initial temperature is \\( \\frac{373.15}{323.15} \\), which is approximately 1.154. So, if temperature increases by a factor of 1.154, what happens to the velocity and kinetic energy?\n\nOption B says velocity increases by a factor of four. Again, if velocity increases by four, kinetic energy would increase by \\( 4^2 = 16 \\) times, which doesn't match the temperature ratio of 1.154.\n\nOption C says kinetic energy increases by a factor of 2. But the temperature ratio is about 1.154, which is less than 2. So, that doesn't seem right either.\n\nOption D says kinetic energy increases by a factor of less than 2. Hmm, since the temperature ratio is about 1.154, which is less than 2, maybe this is the correct choice.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure. Let's think about the relationship again. For an ideal gas, the average kinetic energy is proportional to the absolute temperature: \\( \\langle E_k \\rangle \\propto T \\). So, if temperature increases by a factor of 1.154, kinetic energy should also increase by the same factor, which is less than 2.\n\nBut option C says kinetic energy increases by a factor of 2, which is more than the actual factor of 1.154, and option D says less than 2, which matches the actual factor.\n\nSo, option D seems correct for kinetic energy.\n\nBut what about velocity? The problem mentions velocity increases by a factor of two or four in options A and B. Since kinetic energy depends on velocity squared, a change in kinetic energy corresponds to a change in velocity squared.\n\nSpecifically, \\( \\langle E_k \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\propto T \\), so \\( v^2 \\propto T \\), which means \\( v \\propto \\sqrt{T} \\).\n\nTherefore, if temperature increases by a factor of 1.154, velocity should increase by \\( \\sqrt{1.154} \\), which is approximately 1.074. So, velocity increases by a factor of about 1.074, which is less than 2 and less than 4.\n\nSo, neither option A nor B seems correct regarding velocity, because they suggest larger increases.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is trying to trick me by mixing up statements about velocity and kinetic energy.\n\nLet me read the question again: \"Which statement best describes the behavior of the gas molecules?\"\n\nOptions are:\n\nA. Their velocity increases by a factor of two.\n\nB. Their velocity increases by a factor of four.\n\nC. Their kinetic energy increases by a factor of 2.\n\nD. Their kinetic energy increases by a factor of less than 2.\n\nFrom my calculations, the temperature increases by a factor of \\( \\frac{373.15}{323.15} \\approx 1.154 \\), so:\n\n- Kinetic energy should increase by the same factor, 1.154, since \\( \\langle E_k \\rangle \\propto T \\).\n\n- Velocity should increase by the square root of that factor, \\( \\sqrt{1.154} \\approx 1.074 \\).\n\nTherefore, kinetic energy increases by approximately 1.154 times, which is less than 2, so option D is correct.\n\nVelocity increases by approximately 1.074 times, which is also less than 2, but the options for velocity suggest larger increases (factor of 2 or 4), which don't match.\n\nSo, the correct choice is option D: their kinetic energy increases by a factor of less than 2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"which statement best describes the behavior of the gas molecules\", and it's a multiple-choice question with four options. I need to pick the one that accurately describes the behavior based on the temperature change.\n\nGiven that kinetic energy increases by a factor of about 1.154, which is indeed less than 2, option D is correct.\n\nOption C is incorrect because kinetic energy does not increase by a factor of 2; it's less than that.\n\nSimilarly, options A and B suggest large increases in velocity, which, based on the square root relationship, should be only about 7.4%, not 100% or 300%.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option D.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the relationship again: \\( \\langle E_k \\rangle \\propto T \\), so \\( \\frac{\\langle E_k \\rangle_{\\text{final}}}{\\langle E_k \\rangle_{\\text{initial}}} = \\frac{T_{\\text{final}}}{T_{\\text{initial}}} = \\frac{373.15}{323.15} \\approx 1.154 \\), which is indeed less than 2.\n\nThus, option D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
