                    "text": "Alright, so I have this question about DNA pairing. It says that in DNA, adenine normally pairs with which of the following: A. cytosine, B. guanine, C. thymine, or D. uracil. Hmm, I think I remember something about DNA having base pairs, and there are specific ones that go together. Let me see.\n\nFirst off, I know that DNA is made up of four nucleotide bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). These bases pair up in a specific way when DNA strands come together to form a double helix. I recall that adenine always pairs with thymine, and cytosine always pairs with guanine. This is like a rule, right?\n\nSo, looking at the options:\n\nA. cytosine.\n\nB. guanine.\n\nC. thymine.\n\nD. uracil.\n\nBased on what I remember, adenine should pair with thymine. So, the correct answer should be C. thymine.\n\nWait a minute, what's uracil? Is that part of DNA? I think uracil is found in RNA, not DNA. In RNA, uracil replaces thymine and pairs with adenine. So, in RNA, adenine pairs with uracil, but in DNA, it's thymine.\n\nThe question specifies that it's about DNA, so uracil shouldn't be considered here. Maybe the option D is a distractor to test if I know the difference between DNA and RNA base pairing.\n\nLet me double-check this. In DNA, the base pairs are A-T and C-G. In RNA, they are A-U and C-G. So, since this question is about DNA, adenine should indeed pair with thymine.\n\nI don't think it's cytosine or guanine because they typically pair with guanine and adenine, respectively. So, options A and B seem incorrect.\n\nOption C, thymine, seems correct, and option D, uracil, is not part of DNA.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. thymine.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any exception or special case where adenine might pair with something else in DNA. For example, in certain mutations or under unusual conditions, mispairing can occur, but that's not the normal pairing.\n\nThe question specifies \"normally pairs with,\" so I think it's safe to assume standard base pairing rules apply here.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The answer is C. thymine.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
