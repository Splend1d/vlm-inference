                    "text": "So I've got this question about dietary calcium, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that typical calcium intake in most adults is between 0.5mg and 2.0mg per day. Hmm, that seems really low. I remember that the recommended daily intake of calcium for adults is around 1000 to 1200 milligrams per day. Wait, is that milligrams or micrograms? No, it's definitely milligrams. Let me double-check that. Yes, the Dietary Reference Intakes from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommend that adults aged 19-50 should aim for 1000mg of calcium per day, and those over 50 should have 1200mg per day. So, option A is saying typical intake is between 0.5mg and 2.0mg, which seems way below the recommended amounts. Maybe it's a typo, or perhaps it's referring to something else. For now, I'll note that this seems incorrect.\n\nOption B states that activated Vitamin D decreases absorption of dietary calcium. I thought the opposite was true. Vitamin D is known to help with calcium absorption in the gut. In fact, when Vitamin D is activated, it promotes the absorption of calcium from food. So, this statement seems contrary to what I know. Maybe I should look this up to be sure, but based on my knowledge, this seems false.\n\nOption C says there is clear evidence that people who consume more than the average amount of calcium have a lower risk of bone fractures. This sounds plausible. High calcium intake is often associated with stronger bones and a reduced risk of osteoporosis, which could lead to fewer fractures. However, I should consider if there's any research that directly supports this claim. I recall that while increasing calcium intake can benefit bone health up to a point, excessive consumption might not necessarily provide additional benefits and could even have health risks. So, while there might be some evidence supporting this, I'm not sure if it's \"clear\" evidence or if there are limitations to this statement.\n\nOption D mentions that absorption efficiency is inversely related to calcium intake, so that a higher proportion is absorbed when calcium intake is low. This makes sense because the body regulates calcium absorption based on its needs. When intake is low, the body becomes more efficient at absorbing calcium to maintain adequate levels, and when intake is high, absorption efficiency decreases to prevent excessive calcium buildup in the body. This is part of the body's homeostatic mechanisms to keep calcium levels stable.\n\nSo, based on my understanding:\n\n- Option A seems incorrect because typical calcium intake is generally higher than what's stated.\n\n- Option B is likely false because activated Vitamin D actually increases calcium absorption.\n\n- Option C might be somewhat true, but perhaps not entirely accurate due to potential limitations or variations in research.\n\n- Option D appears to be true based on the body's regulatory processes for calcium absorption.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement among these options seems to be Option D: Absorption efficiency is inversely related to calcium intake, so that a higher proportion is absorbed when calcium intake is low.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
