Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the statement is saying. \"No artifacts are people\" means that none of the artifacts are considered to be people. So, in logical terms, for every x that is an artifact, x is not a person.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. ~Pa\n\nI think here that \"P\" stands for people and \"A\" for artifacts, but I'm not sure about the notation. Maybe \"Pa\" means \"P of a,\" like people of a certain type? But this seems unclear. I need something that expresses that no artifacts are people, not just that people are not artifacts.\n\nB. (\u2200x)(Ax \u2283 ~Px)\n\nThis looks like it says \"for all x, if x is an artifact, then x is not a person.\" That seems to match my initial understanding of the statement. So this could be the correct translation.\n\nC. ~Ap\n\nAgain, similar to option A, this seems to be saying that artifacts are not people, but it's not clear if it's covering all artifacts or just one. Maybe it's trying to say that artifacts are not people in general, but the notation is a bit ambiguous.\n\nD. (\u2200x)(Ax \u2022 ~Px)\n\nThis option says \"for all x, x is an artifact and x is not a person.\" This seems different from the original statement. The original says that no artifacts are people, which is a universal negative statement. This option seems to be saying that everything is an artifact and not a person, which is not what the original statement intended.\n\nSo, comparing these options, option B seems to be the most accurate translation of \"No artifacts are people.\" It uses the implication to express that whenever something is an artifact, it is not a person.\n\nLet me double-check. In predicate logic, \"no S are P\" translates to \"(\u2200x)(Sx \u2283 ~Px),\" which is exactly what option B says: (\u2200x)(Ax \u2283 ~Px).\n\nOption D, on the other hand, is saying that everything is an artifact and not a person, which is too strong and not what the statement is trying to convey.\n\nOption A and C seem to be missing the universal quantifier, which is necessary to make the statement about all artifacts, not just some or one.\n\nTherefore, the best translation into predicate logic for \"No artifacts are people\" is option B: (\u2200x)(Ax \u2283 ~Px).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
