                    "text": "So I have this logic problem to solve. I need to construct a truth table for the given argument and then determine if it's valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I have to pick one of the counterexample options provided. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the argument. There are three propositions here: S, T, and U. The argument has three premises and a conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: ~S \u2228 T\n\n2. Premise 2: ~S \u00b7 U\n\n3. Premise 3: ~T \u2228 U\n\n4. Conclusion: T \u00b7 U\n\nI need to see if whenever all three premises are true, the conclusion is also true. If there's at least one case where the premises are true and the conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid, and that case is a counterexample.\n\nAlright, to do this systematically, I should make a truth table with all possible combinations of truth values for S, T, and U. Since there are three variables, there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. S is true, T is true, U is true\n\n2. S is true, T is true, U is false\n\n3. S is true, T is false, U is true\n\n4. S is true, T is false, U is false\n\n5. S is false, T is true, U is true\n\n6. S is false, T is true, U is false\n\n7. S is false, T is false, U is true\n\n8. S is false, T is false, U is false\n\nNow, for each of these combinations, I need to evaluate the truth values of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nLet's start with the first combination: S is true, T is true, U is true.\n\n1. Premise 1: ~S \u2228 T = false \u2228 true = true\n\n2. Premise 2: ~S \u00b7 U = false \u00b7 true = false\n\n3. Premise 3: ~T \u2228 U = false \u2228 true = true\n\n4. Conclusion: T \u00b7 U = true \u00b7 true = true\n\nSo, in this case, the premises are not all true (since premise 2 is false), so this doesn't count as a counterexample. The conclusion is true, but since not all premises are true, it doesn't affect the validity of the argument.\n\nNext, combination 2: S is true, T is true, U is false.\n\n1. Premise 1: ~S \u2228 T = false \u2228 true = true\n\n2. Premise 2: ~S \u00b7 U = false \u00b7 false = false\n\n3. Premise 3: ~T \u2228 U = false \u2228 false = false\n\n4. Conclusion: T \u00b7 U = true \u00b7 false = false\n\nAgain, not all premises are true (premises 2 and 3 are false), so no counterexample here.\n\nCombination 3: S is true, T is false, U is true.\n\n1. Premise 1: ~S \u2228 T = false \u2228 false = false\n\n2. Premise 2: ~S \u00b7 U = false \u00b7 true = false\n\n3. Premise 3: ~T \u2228 U = true \u2228 true = true\n\n4. Conclusion: T \u00b7 U = false \u00b7 true = false\n\nHere, not all premises are true (premises 1 and 2 are false), so no counterexample.\n\nCombination 4: S is true, T is false, U is false.\n\n1. Premise 1: ~S \u2228 T = false \u2228 false = false\n\n2. Premise 2: ~S \u00b7 U = false \u00b7 false = false\n\n3. Premise 3: ~T \u2228 U = true \u2228 false = true\n\n4. Conclusion: T \u00b7 U = false \u00b7 false = false\n\nAgain, premises 1 and 2 are false, so no counterexample.\n\nCombination 5: S is false, T is true, U is true.\n\n1. Premise 1: ~S \u2228 T = true \u2228 true = true\n\n2. Premise 2: ~S \u00b7 U = true \u00b7 true = true\n\n3. Premise 3: ~T \u2228 U = false \u2228 true = true\n\n4. Conclusion: T \u00b7 U = true \u00b7 true = true\n\nNow, all premises are true, and the conclusion is also true. So, this is a valid case for the argument.\n\nCombination 6: S is false, T is true, U is false.\n\n1. Premise 1: ~S \u2228 T = true \u2228 true = true\n\n2. Premise 2: ~S \u00b7 U = true \u00b7 false = false\n\n3. Premise 3: ~T \u2228 U = false \u2228 false = false\n\n4. Conclusion: T \u00b7 U = true \u00b7 false = false\n\nHere, premises 2 and 3 are false, so no counterexample.\n\nCombination 7: S is false, T is false, U is true.\n\n1. Premise 1: ~S \u2228 T = true \u2228 false = true\n\n2. Premise 2: ~S \u00b7 U = true \u00b7 true = true\n\n3. Premise 3: ~T \u2228 U = true \u2228 true = true\n\n4. Conclusion: T \u00b7 U = false \u00b7 true = false\n\nWait a minute, in this case, all three premises are true, but the conclusion is false. So, this is a counterexample. The argument is invalid because there exists at least one case where the premises are true and the conclusion is false.\n\nJust to check the last combination: S is false, T is false, U is false.\n\n1. Premise 1: ~S \u2228 T = true \u2228 false = true\n\n2. Premise 2: ~S \u00b7 U = true \u00b7 false = false\n\n3. Premise 3: ~T \u2228 U = true \u2228 false = true\n\n4. Conclusion: T \u00b7 U = false \u00b7 false = false\n\nAgain, premises 1 and 3 are true, but premise 2 is false, so no counterexample here.\n\nSo, the argument is invalid, and one counterexample is combination 7: S is false, T is false, U is true.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. Valid\n\nB. Invalid. Counterexample when S, T, and U are true\n\nC. Invalid. Counterexample when S and U are true and T is false\n\nD. Invalid. Counterexample when U is true and S and T are false\n\nFrom my analysis, the correct choice is D: Invalid. Counterexample when U is true and S and T are false. This corresponds to combination 7, where S is false, T is false, U is true, and the conclusion is false, even though all premises are true.\n\nJust to double-check, let's look at the other options:\n\nB. Invalid. Counterexample when S, T, and U are true.\n\nIn this case, from combination 1: S true, T true, U true.\n\nBut in this case, not all premises are true (premise 2 is false), so it's not a valid counterexample.\n\nC. Invalid. Counterexample when S and U are true and T is false.\n\nThis is combination 3: S true, T false, U true.\n\nAgain, not all premises are true (premises 1 and 2 are false), so not a counterexample.\n\nD. Invalid. Counterexample when U is true and S and T are false.\n\nThis is combination 7: S false, T false, U true.\n\nHere, all premises are true, but the conclusion is false, which is indeed a counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
