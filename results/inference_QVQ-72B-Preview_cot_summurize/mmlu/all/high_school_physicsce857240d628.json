                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about an ideal gas in a rigid container, which means the volume is constant. Initially, it has volume V1, temperature T1, and pressure P1. Then the temperature is increased in an isochoric process. Now, I need to figure out which statement is not true among the options provided.\n\nFirst off, let's make sure I understand what an isochoric process is. Isochoric means that the volume remains constant. So, in this case, since the container is rigid and solid, the volume can't change. That means V1 is the same before and after the temperature increase.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that the average speed of the molecules increases. I remember that for ideal gases, the average kinetic energy of the molecules is proportional to the absolute temperature. The formula is something like KE_avg = (3/2)kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. So, if the temperature increases, the average kinetic energy increases, which means the average speed of the molecules should also increase. So, this seems to be true.\n\nOption B says that the pressure increases. For an ideal gas, there's a relationship between pressure, volume, and temperature given by the equation PV = nRT, where n is the number of moles and R is the ideal gas constant. Since the volume is constant in this process, if the temperature increases, what happens to the pressure?\n\nLet me rearrange the equation to solve for pressure: P = nR * T / V. Since n and V are constant, if T increases, P should increase proportionally. So, this seems to be true as well.\n\nOption C says that the kinetic energy of the system increases. Well, for an ideal gas, the internal energy is entirely kinetic energy of the molecules. And as we saw in option A, if the temperature increases, the average kinetic energy per molecule increases. Therefore, the total kinetic energy of the system should increase because there are more molecules moving faster. So, this also seems to be true.\n\nOption D says that the volume increases. But wait, this is a rigid container with constant volume. That means the volume can't change. So, even if the temperature increases, the volume should remain the same. Therefore, this statement seems to be false.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something. In an isochoric process, by definition, the volume is held constant. So, increasing the temperature while keeping the volume constant should lead to an increase in pressure and temperature, but the volume should stay the same. The kinetic energy and the average speed of the molecules should still increase because of the temperature increase.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is not true is option D: the volume increases. The volume should remain constant in this process.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's think about the behavior of the gas molecules. When the temperature increases, the molecules move faster, colliding more frequently with the walls of the container. Since the container is rigid and volume is constant, these increased collisions will lead to higher pressure. The kinetic energy of the molecules increases with temperature, and the average speed increases as well. But the volume doesn't change; it's fixed by the container.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that option D is not true in this scenario.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
