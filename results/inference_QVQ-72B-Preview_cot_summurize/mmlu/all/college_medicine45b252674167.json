                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. It's about the Doppler effect, which happens when there's relative motion between the source of a wave and the observer. In this case, the source is the gunshot from an actor in a moving car, and the observer is a camera on a moving platform.\n\nFirst, let's summarize the given information:\n\n- The car is moving at 108 km/h.\n\n- The camera platform is moving at 72 km/h in the same direction.\n\n- The distance between the car and the camera is 200 meters.\n\n- The original frequency of the gunshot is 800 Hz.\n\nWe need to find the perceived frequency at the camera.\n\nSince both the source and the observer are moving, we need to use the general Doppler effect formula for moving source and moving observer.\n\nThe formula for the perceived frequency \\( f \\) is:\n\n\\[ f = \\left( \\frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s} \\right) \\times f_0 \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( f \\) is the perceived frequency.\n\n- \\( v \\) is the speed of sound in the medium (usually air).\n\n- \\( v_o \\) is the speed of the observer towards the source.\n\n- \\( v_s \\) is the speed of the source towards the observer.\n\n- \\( f_0 \\) is the emitted frequency.\n\nBut wait, both the source and the observer are moving in the same direction. I need to be careful with the signs here.\n\nLet's convert all speeds to the same unit. Since the distance is in meters, I'll convert km/h to m/s.\n\n1 km/h = \\( \\frac{1000}{3600} \\) m/s = \\( \\frac{5}{18} \\) m/s.\n\nSo,\n\n- Speed of the car: 108 km/h = \\( 108 \\times \\frac{5}{18} = 30 \\) m/s.\n\n- Speed of the camera platform: 72 km/h = \\( 72 \\times \\frac{5}{18} = 20 \\) m/s.\n\nThe speed of sound in air is approximately 343 m/s.\n\nNow, since both the source and the observer are moving in the same direction, with the source moving faster than the observer (30 m/s vs. 20 m/s), the relative speed between them is \\( 30 - 20 = 10 \\) m/s, with the source moving away from the observer.\n\nWait a minute, if the source is moving away from the observer, that means the perceived frequency should be lower than the emitted frequency.\n\nBut let's confirm this with the formula.\n\nIn the standard Doppler effect formula, \\( v_o \\) is positive if the observer is moving towards the source, and \\( v_s \\) is positive if the source is moving away from the observer.\n\nGiven that both are moving in the same direction, with the source moving faster than the observer, the observer is moving towards the source at 10 m/s (since 20 m/s - 30 m/s = -10 m/s, but in the formula, relative motion towards the source would be positive).\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's recall the formula more carefully.\n\nThe formula for the observed frequency when both the source and the observer are moving is:\n\n\\[ f = \\left( \\frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s} \\right) \\times f_0 \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( v \\) is the speed of sound.\n\n- \\( v_o \\) is the speed of the observer relative to the medium (positive if moving towards the source).\n\n- \\( v_s \\) is the speed of the source relative to the medium (positive if moving away from the observer).\n\nGiven that both are moving in the same direction, with the source moving faster than the observer, the source is moving away from the observer.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- \\( v_o = 20 \\) m/s (observer moving towards the source).\n\n- \\( v_s = 30 \\) m/s (source moving away from the observer).\n\nPlugging these into the formula:\n\n\\[ f = \\left( \\frac{343 + 20}{343 - 30} \\right) \\times 800 \\]\n\n\\[ f = \\left( \\frac{363}{313} \\right) \\times 800 \\]\n\nNow, calculate \\( \\frac{363}{313} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{363}{313} \\approx 1.1597 \\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ f \\approx 1.1597 \\times 800 \\]\n\n\\[ f \\approx 927.76 \\) Hz\n\nBut this is not matching with any of the options provided: A. 941 Hz, B. 787 Hz, C. 924 Hz, D. 912 Hz.\n\nHmm, maybe I've made a mistake in setting up the formula.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nSince both the source and observer are moving in the same direction, with the source moving faster, the relative speed between them is \\( 30 - 20 = 10 \\) m/s, with the source moving away from the observer.\n\nIn the Doppler effect formula, \\( v_o \\) is the observer's speed towards the source, and \\( v_s \\) is the source's speed away from the observer.\n\nSo, \\( v_o = 20 \\) m/s (since the observer is moving towards the source), and \\( v_s = 30 \\) m/s (since the source is moving away from the observer).\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\n\\[ f = \\left( \\frac{343 + 20}{343 - 30} \\right) \\times 800 \\]\n\n\\[ f = \\left( \\frac{363}{313} \\right) \\times 800 \\]\n\n\\[ f \\approx 1.1597 \\times 800 \\]\n\n\\[ f \\approx 927.76 \\) Hz\n\nBut this doesn't match the options. Maybe I need to consider the direction more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the more general formula for moving source and observer:\n\n\\[ f = f_0 \\times \\left( \\frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s} \\right) \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( v \\) is the speed of sound.\n\n- \\( v_o \\) is the component of the observer's velocity towards the source.\n\n- \\( v_s \\) is the component of the source's velocity away from the observer.\n\nI think I might have misinterpreted the signs.\n\nLet me try redefining the signs:\n\n- \\( v_o \\) is positive if the observer is moving towards the source.\n\n- \\( v_s \\) is positive if the source is moving away from the observer.\n\nGiven that the source is moving away from the observer at 10 m/s, \\( v_s = 30 \\) m/s.\n\nThe observer is moving towards the source at 20 m/s, so \\( v_o = 20 \\) m/s.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\n\\[ f = \\left( \\frac{343 + 20}{343 - 30} \\right) \\times 800 \\]\n\n\\[ f = \\left( \\frac{363}{313} \\right) \\times 800 \\]\n\n\\[ f \\approx 1.1597 \\times 800 \\]\n\n\\[ f \\approx 927.76 \\) Hz\n\nStill getting the same result, which isn't matching the options.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the relative speed differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for moving source and moving observer in terms of relative speed.\n\nLet me recall that the perceived frequency can also be calculated using:\n\n\\[ f = f_0 \\times \\left( \\frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s} \\right) \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( v \\) is the speed of sound.\n\n- \\( v_o \\) is the observer's speed towards the source.\n\n- \\( v_s \\) is the source's speed away from the observer.\n\nGiven that, \\( v_o = 20 \\) m/s (towards the source), and \\( v_s = 30 \\) m/s (away from the observer).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ f = 800 \\times \\left( \\frac{343 + 20}{343 - 30} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ f = 800 \\times \\left( \\frac{363}{313} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ f \\approx 800 \\times 1.1597 \\]\n\n\\[ f \\approx 927.76 \\) Hz\n\nStill the same result.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that both source and observer are moving in the same direction, and calculate the relative speed based on that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different formula when both are moving.\n\nLet me try using the formula for the general case of both source and observer moving:\n\n\\[ f' = f_0 \\times \\left( \\frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s} \\right) \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( f' \\) is the frequency received by the observer.\n\n- \\( f_0 \\) is the emitted frequency.\n\n- \\( v \\) is the speed of sound.\n\n- \\( v_o \\) is the observer's speed towards the source.\n\n- \\( v_s \\) is the source's speed away from the observer.\n\nGiven that, \\( v_o = 20 \\) m/s (towards the source), and \\( v_s = 30 \\) m/s (away from the observer).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ f' = 800 \\times \\left( \\frac{343 + 20}{343 - 30} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ f' = 800 \\times \\left( \\frac{363}{313} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ f' \\approx 800 \\times 1.1597 \\]\n\n\\[ f' \\approx 927.76 \\) Hz\n\nThis is still not matching the options. Maybe there's a mistake in the formula I'm using.\n\nLet me look up the Doppler effect formula for both source and observer moving.\n\nUpon checking, the formula I've been using seems correct:\n\n\\[ f' = f_0 \\times \\left( \\frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s} \\right) \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( v_o \\) is the observer's speed towards the source.\n\n- \\( v_s \\) is the source's speed away from the observer.\n\nGiven that, and plugging in the values, I keep getting approximately 927.76 Hz, which is closest to option C. 924 Hz.\n\nBut the exact calculation gives approximately 927.76 Hz, which isn't exactly 924 Hz.\n\nMaybe the options have some rounding differences, or perhaps there's a different approach to this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the distance between the car and the camera.\n\nThe problem mentions that the camera is 200 meters away from the car, but since both are moving in the same direction, the distance isn't changing (assuming they are moving parallel to each other).\n\nWait, actually, since both are moving in the same direction with different speeds, the distance between them is changing over time.\n\nBut in the context of the Doppler effect for sound, the frequency shift depends on the relative velocity, not the distance.\n\nSo, perhaps the distance is just additional information and isn't relevant for calculating the frequency shift.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the distance affects the time it takes for the sound to reach the camera, but that shouldn't affect the frequency.\n\nI think the main point here is the relative motion between the source and the observer.\n\nGiven that, and using the formula I've applied, I arrive at approximately 927.76 Hz, which is closest to option C. 924 Hz.\n\nPerhaps the exact calculation with more decimal places would give exactly 924 Hz, but with my calculation, it's approximately 927.76 Hz.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different formula or consideration I'm missing.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nSuppose I consider the relative velocity between the source and the observer.\n\nThe relative velocity \\( v_{rel} \\) is:\n\n\\[ v_{rel} = v_s - v_o = 30 m/s - 20 m/s = 10 m/s \\]\n\nSince the source is moving away from the observer, the perceived frequency should be lower.\n\nUsing the simplified Doppler formula for moving source and stationary observer:\n\n\\[ f' = f_0 \\times \\left( \\frac{v}{v - v_s} \\right) \\]\n\nBut in this case, the observer is not stationary, so this might not apply directly.\n\nAlternatively, for both source and observer moving, the general formula is:\n\n\\[ f' = f_0 \\times \\left( \\frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s} \\right) \\]\n\nWhich is what I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the medium's speed relative to the source and observer.\n\nAssuming the medium (air) is stationary, which is a standard assumption, my earlier approach should be correct.\n\nGiven that, and my calculation leading to approximately 927.76 Hz, which is closest to option C. 924 Hz, I'll go with that.\n\nMaybe the options have some rounding differences, or perhaps the exact calculation with more decimal places would give exactly 924 Hz.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different formula or consideration I'm missing, but based on standard Doppler effect formulas, option C seems the closest.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
