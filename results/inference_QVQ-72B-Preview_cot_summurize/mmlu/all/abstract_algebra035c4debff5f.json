                    "text": "So I need to find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q. That means I need to find the degree of the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) over the rational numbers Q. The options are 0, 4, 2, and 6. Hmm, 0 doesn't make much sense for a degree, so I can probably eliminate that option right away.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a field extension degree represents. It's the dimension of the larger field as a vector space over the smaller field. So, if I can find a basis for Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q, the number of elements in that basis will give me the degree.\n\nI know that both sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are irrational, and their minimal polynomials over Q are x^2 - 2 and x^2 - 3, respectively, both of degree 2. So, the extension Q(sqrt(2)) over Q has degree 2, and Q(sqrt(3)) over Q has degree 2 as well.\n\nNow, sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) is the element we're extending Q by. I need to find its minimal polynomial over Q. Maybe I can express sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) in terms of a basis and find its minimal polynomial that way.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that the degree of Q(a) over Q is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial of a over Q. So, if I can find the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) over Q, its degree will give me the extension degree.\n\nLet me try to find the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) + sqrt(3). Let's set a = sqrt(2) + sqrt(3). Then, I need to find the smallest polynomial with rational coefficients that a satisfies.\n\nLet me compute a^2: a^2 = (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))^2 = 2 + 2*sqrt(6) + 3 = 5 + 2*sqrt(6). So, a^2 - 5 = 2*sqrt(6), which means sqrt(6) = (a^2 - 5)/2.\n\nNow, sqrt(6) is also irrational, so maybe I can express higher powers of a in terms of lower powers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q, which has degree 4 because [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)):Q] = [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)):Q(sqrt(2))][Q(sqrt(2)):Q] = 2*2 = 4.\n\nNow, Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) is a subfield of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), since sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) is in Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)). So, the degree of Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q must divide the degree of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q, which is 4. So, possible degrees are 1, 2, 4.\n\nBut option D is 6, which doesn't divide 4, so I can eliminate that option.\n\nNow, between 1, 2, and 4, which one is correct?\n\nIf the degree is 1, that would mean Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) = Q, which implies that sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) is rational. But sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) is not rational, because sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are both irrational and their sum is not rational (since sqrt(2) is not rational, and sqrt(3) is not rational, and they are not negatives of each other). So, degree 1 is out.\n\nNow, between 2 and 4, which one is correct?\n\nLet me try to find the minimal polynomial of a = sqrt(2) + sqrt(3). If it's degree 2, then there exists a quadratic polynomial with rational coefficients that a satisfies, and that polynomial is irreducible over Q.\n\nBut from earlier, a^2 = 5 + 2*sqrt(6), so a^2 - 5 = 2*sqrt(6). Then, (a^2 - 5)^2 = (2*sqrt(6))^2, which simplifies to a^4 - 10a^2 + 25 = 24. So, a^4 - 10a^2 + 1 = 0.\n\nWait, so a satisfies a^4 - 10a^2 + 1 = 0. Is this polynomial irreducible over Q?\n\nLet me check if this polynomial can be factored into quadratics with rational coefficients.\n\nSuppose it factors as (a^2 + p a + q)(a^2 + r a + s) = a^4 + (p + r)a^3 + (q + s + p r)a^2 + (p s + q r)a + q s.\n\nComparing coefficients:\n\n1. Coefficient of a^3: p + r = 0 (since there's no a^3 term in the original polynomial)\n\n2. Coefficient of a^2: q + s + p r = -10\n\n3. Coefficient of a: p s + q r = 0\n\n4. Constant term: q s = 1\n\nFrom p + r = 0, so r = -p.\n\nThen, from p s + q r = 0, substituting r = -p, we get p s - p q = 0, which simplifies to p(s - q) = 0. So, either p = 0 or s = q.\n\nCase 1: p = 0.\n\nThen r = 0.\n\nFrom q + s + p r = q + s = -10.\n\nAnd q s = 1.\n\nSo, s = 1/q.\n\nThen q + 1/q = -10.\n\nMultiply both sides by q: q^2 + 1 = -10 q.\n\nSo, q^2 + 10 q + 1 = 0.\n\nSolving for q: q = [-10 \u00b1 sqrt(100 - 4)]/2 = [-10 \u00b1 sqrt(96)]/2 = [-10 \u00b1 4 sqrt(6)]/2 = -5 \u00b1 2 sqrt(6).\n\nThese are not rational, so no rational solutions for q. Therefore, no factorization into quadratics with rational coefficients.\n\nTherefore, the minimal polynomial of a over Q is a^4 - 10a^2 + 1, which is irreducible over Q.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q is 4.\n\nAlternatively, since [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)):Q] = 4, and Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) is a subfield of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), and we've shown that its degree over Q is 4, so the answer is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
