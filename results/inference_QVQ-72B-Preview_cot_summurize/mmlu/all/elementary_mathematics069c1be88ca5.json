                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Ron's garden. It says that Ron's garden has 42 plants, and each row has 7 plants. I need to find out how many rows there are in Ron's garden. The options are given as expressions: 42 \u00f7 7, 42 \u2013 7, 42 + 7, and 42 \u00d7 7. I need to pick the one that will give me the number of rows.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. I have a total of 42 plants, and they are arranged in rows where each row contains 7 plants. I need to find out how many such rows there are.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. If each row has 7 plants, then the number of rows would be the total number of plants divided by the number of plants per row. So, that would be 42 divided by 7. Let me check if that's one of the options. Yes, option A is 42 \u00f7 7.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's consider why the other options might not be correct.\n\nOption B is 42 \u2013 7. If I subtract 7 from 42, that would give me 35. But that doesn't make sense in the context of finding the number of rows. It seems like it's just reducing the total number of plants by one row, but it doesn't give me the count of rows.\n\nOption C is 42 + 7. Adding 7 to 42 gives me 49. Again, this doesn't help me find the number of rows. It seems unrelated to the problem.\n\nOption D is 42 \u00d7 7. Multiplying 42 by 7 would give me 294. This would be the total number of plants if there were 42 plants in each of 7 rows, but that's not what the problem is asking. Here, we already have 42 plants and need to find the number of rows with 7 plants each.\n\nSo, clearly, the correct expression is 42 \u00f7 7, which is option A.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check this. Suppose there are 7 plants in each row and there are, say, 6 rows. Then, total plants would be 7 \u00d7 6 = 42. So, to find the number of rows, I would take the total plants and divide by the number of plants per row: 42 \u00f7 7 = 6 rows. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of multiplication, if r is the number of rows, then 7 \u00d7 r = 42. Solving for r, r = 42 \u00f7 7.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to see how many times 7 fits into 42. Seven times six is 42, so 6 rows.\n\nI don't think subtraction or addition makes sense here because subtraction would reduce the total plants, and addition would increase it, but neither helps in counting the number of rows.\n\nMultiplication, as in option D, would be used if we were trying to find the total number of plants given the number of rows and plants per row, but that's not what the problem is asking.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression to find the number of rows is 42 \u00f7 7.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. Maybe if the rows aren't complete, but the problem says each row has 7 plants, so presumably, all rows have exactly 7 plants, and there are no leftover plants.\n\nSo, no, there's no need to consider incomplete rows. The expression remains 42 \u00f7 7.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The answer is option A: 42 \u00f7 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
