                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, John noticed that the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock was 110 degrees when he left home after 6 p.m., and also 110 degrees when he returned after 6 p.m. but before 7 p.m. the same night. He was away for more than five minutes, and we need to find out how many minutes he was away. The options are 36, 40, 38, or 43 minutes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the angles between the hour and minute hands change over time on a 12-hour clock. I recall that the hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, which is 0.5 degrees per minute (since 360 degrees / 12 hours * 60 minutes = 0.5 degrees/minute). The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, which is 6 degrees per minute.\n\nLet's denote the time John left home as 6:00 p.m. plus some minutes, say 6:M1 minutes, and the time he returned as 6:M2 minutes, where M1 and M2 are minutes past 6 p.m.\n\nAt 6:00 p.m., the hour hand is at 180 degrees (since each hour represents 30 degrees: 360 degrees / 12 hours = 30 degrees/hour, and at 6, it's 6*30 = 180 degrees).\n\nNow, at 6:M1 minutes, the hour hand would have moved an additional (M1 * 0.5) degrees from the 180-degree mark, so its position is 180 + 0.5*M1 degrees.\n\nThe minute hand at M1 minutes is at (M1 * 6) degrees.\n\nThe angle between the hour and minute hands is given by the absolute difference between their positions: |180 + 0.5*M1 - 6*M1| = |180 - 5.5*M1| degrees. This angle is given as 110 degrees when he left.\n\nSo, |180 - 5.5*M1| = 110.\n\nSimilarly, when he returned at 6:M2 minutes, the hour hand is at 180 + 0.5*M2 degrees, and the minute hand is at 6*M2 degrees. The angle between them is |180 + 0.5*M2 - 6*M2| = |180 - 5.5*M2| degrees, and this is also 110 degrees.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. |180 - 5.5*M1| = 110\n\n2. |180 - 5.5*M2| = 110\n\nLet's solve the first equation for M1.\n\n|180 - 5.5*M1| = 110\n\nThis absolute value equation can be split into two cases:\n\nCase 1: 180 - 5.5*M1 = 110\n\nCase 2: 180 - 5.5*M1 = -110\n\nLet's solve both.\n\nCase 1:\n\n180 - 5.5*M1 = 110\n\nSubtract 180 from both sides:\n\n-5.5*M1 = -70\n\nDivide both sides by -5.5:\n\nM1 = 70 / 5.5 = 12.727... minutes\n\nBut since time is usually measured in whole minutes, maybe it's 13 minutes.\n\nCase 2:\n\n180 - 5.5*M1 = -110\n\nAdd 180 to both sides:\n\n-5.5*M1 = -110 + 180 = 70\n\nDivide both sides by -5.5:\n\nM1 = 70 / 5.5 = 12.727... minutes\n\nHmm, both cases give the same time, which seems off. Maybe I need to consider that the absolute value equation has only one positive solution in this context.\n\nSo, M1 \u2248 12.727 minutes, which is roughly 12 minutes and 43 seconds. For simplicity, perhaps it's 13 minutes.\n\nNow, let's solve the second equation for M2.\n\n|180 - 5.5*M2| = 110\n\nAgain, split into two cases:\n\nCase 1: 180 - 5.5*M2 = 110\n\nCase 2: 180 - 5.5*M2 = -110\n\nSolving Case 1:\n\n180 - 5.5*M2 = 110\n\n-5.5*M2 = -70\n\nM2 = 70 / 5.5 \u2248 12.727 minutes\n\nSolving Case 2:\n\n180 - 5.5*M2 = -110\n\n-5.5*M2 = -290\n\nM2 = 290 / 5.5 \u2248 52.727 minutes\n\nSo, M2 could be approximately 12.727 minutes or 52.727 minutes.\n\nBut wait, if M1 is around 13 minutes and M2 is also around 13 minutes, that would mean he left and returned at the same time, which doesn't make sense. So, likely M2 should be the higher value, around 53 minutes.\n\nBut the problem states that he left and returned after 6 p.m., with the second time being after the first, and he was away for more than five minutes.\n\nSo, if M1 is around 13 minutes and M2 is around 53 minutes, then the time away is M2 - M1 \u2248 53 - 13 = 40 minutes, which matches option B.\n\nBut let's verify this more carefully.\n\nLet's set up the equations again.\n\nFirst, find M1 such that |180 - 5.5*M1| = 110.\n\nSimilarly, find M2 such that |180 - 5.5*M2| = 110, with M2 > M1.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n180 - 5.5*M1 = 110 or 180 - 5.5*M1 = -110\n\nSolving both:\n\n1. 180 - 5.5*M1 = 110 => 5.5*M1 = 70 => M1 = 70 / 5.5 \u2248 12.727 minutes\n\n2. 180 - 5.5*M1 = -110 => 5.5*M1 = 290 => M1 = 290 / 5.5 \u2248 52.727 minutes\n\nBut M1 must be less than M2, so M1 = 12.727 minutes.\n\nSimilarly, for M2:\n\n1. 180 - 5.5*M2 = 110 => M2 = 12.727 minutes\n\n2. 180 - 5.5*M2 = -110 => M2 = 52.727 minutes\n\nSince M2 must be greater than M1, M2 = 52.727 minutes.\n\nTherefore, time away = M2 - M1 \u2248 52.727 - 12.727 = 40 minutes.\n\nSo, the answer should be 40 minutes.\n\nBut let's check if this makes sense.\n\nAt 6:12.727 p.m., the angle is 110 degrees, and at 6:52.727 p.m., the angle is also 110 degrees.\n\nThe time difference is approximately 40 minutes, which is more than 5 minutes, satisfying the condition.\n\nIs there any possibility of another solution?\n\nWell, within the hour from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m., there are two times where the angle is 110 degrees, as we've found.\n\nIs there a possibility that he left and returned at different times within the hour that still give the same angle but with a different time difference?\n\nLet's consider that the angle between the hour and minute hands repeats every 65.27 minutes (which is 720 degrees / 11 minutes, but that might be overcomplicating it).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are more times within the hour where the angle is 110 degrees.\n\nLet's think about the general formula for the angle between the hour and minute hands.\n\nThe hour hand position H is:\n\nH = 0.5 * T degrees, where T is time in minutes past 6 p.m.\n\nThe minute hand position M is:\n\nM = 6 * T degrees.\n\nThe angle A between them is:\n\nA = |H - M| = |0.5*T - 6*T| = | -5.5*T | = 5.5*T degrees.\n\nWait, that can't be right, because at 6:00, H = 180 degrees, M = 0 degrees, angle = 180 degrees, but according to this formula, A = 5.5*0 = 0 degrees, which is incorrect.\n\nAh, I see the mistake. The hour hand position should be 180 degrees plus 0.5 degrees per minute, as I initially thought.\n\nSo, correcting that:\n\nH = 180 + 0.5*T\n\nM = 6*T\n\nA = |H - M| = |180 + 0.5*T - 6*T| = |180 - 5.5*T| degrees.\n\nSetting A = 110:\n\n|180 - 5.5*T| = 110\n\nWhich leads back to the same equations as before.\n\nSo, the two solutions are T \u2248 12.727 minutes and T \u2248 52.727 minutes.\n\nThus, the time away is approximately 52.727 - 12.727 = 40 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 40 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
