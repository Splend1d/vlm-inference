Administer 2 equivalent forms of a test to the same people and correlate.\n\nB. Administer the test twice to the same people and then correlate the scores.\n\nC. Correlations among individual test items.\n\nD. They are not used for an unstable trait.\n\nHmm, I remember that reliability refers to how consistent a test is in measuring whatever it's supposed to measure. There are different types of reliability, like test-retest, alternate forms, and internal consistency.\n\nOption A sounds like alternate forms reliability, where you give two different but equivalent tests to the same group of people and see how their scores correlate. That's not internal consistency.\n\nOption B sounds like test-retest reliability, where you give the same test twice at different times and correlate the scores. Again, that's not internal consistency.\n\nOption C mentions correlations among individual test items. That sounds more like internal consistency. Internal consistency looks at how closely related a set of items are as a group. So, if you have multiple questions measuring the same construct, they should be correlated with each other.\n\nOption D says \"they are not used for an unstable trait.\" Well, reliability in general is about consistency, so if a trait is unstable, it might be harder to measure reliably, but that's not directly defining internal consistency.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems the most fitting definition of internal consistency reliability.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Let me think about it differently.\n\nInternal consistency is about the coherence of the items within a test. It checks whether multiple items measuring the same concept agree with each other. So, it involves looking at the correlations between different items on the same test.\n\nOption A is about administering two equivalent forms, which is more related to split-half reliability or parallel forms reliability.\n\nOption B is test-retest reliability, which assesses stability over time.\n\nOption C is about correlations among individual test items, which aligns with internal consistency.\n\nOption D is a bit vague, but it seems to suggest that internal consistency isn't used for unstable traits, which isn't entirely accurate. Internal consistency can still be calculated for tests measuring unstable traits, but the scores might vary if the trait changes over time.\n\nTherefore, the correct definition among the options provided is C: correlations among individual test items.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should recall some common measures of internal consistency, like Cronbach's alpha, which is a statistic that measures how closely related a set of items are as a group. It's based on the average inter-item correlation, which fits with option C.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to say that option C is the correct definition of internal consistency reliability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
