The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario involves. In Scenario 1, someone filled their friend's car with sugar before returning it. In Scenario 2, a person followed someone home after they refused to give their address. So, the main character in both cases is doing something to another person without their consent.\n\nLet me consider Scenario 1 first. Filling a car with sugar. That sounds like vandalism or sabotage, right? Because sugar isn't fuel; it's a sweetener. Putting it in a car's fuel tank could cause damage to the engine, right? So, this seems like an intentional act to harm someone's property. Morally, that's generally considered wrong. It's against the law too, I believe, because it's malicious damage.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2. Someone refuses to give their address, and then the person follows them home. Hmm, that sounds invasive and possibly dangerous. Following someone without their consent can be seen as stalking or harassment. It's a violation of their privacy and could make them feel threatened or unsafe. In many places, stalking is a crime, so it's not just morally wrong but also legally wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to be clearly morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020. Vandalizing someone's property and following them without consent are both actions that can cause harm or distress to others.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there are contexts where these actions could be justified or not as wrong. For example, in Scenario 1, if the friend had somehow consented to this as a prank and both parties found it funny, maybe it's not as wrong. But generally, without consent, it's wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, if the person was following to ensure the other person's safety or for a benign reason, maybe it's different. But the way it's phrased, \"she said she wouldn't give me her address so I followed her home,\" it seems like it was done against her wishes, which makes it wrong.\n\nBut I should consider if there are any circumstances where following someone home could be seen as okay. For instance, if you were worried about their safety and wanted to make sure they got home alright, but even then, it's tricky because it's still an invasion of privacy. Probably, it's best to respect people's boundaries and not follow them without consent.\n\nSimilarly, in Scenario 1, unless there's some mutual agreement or consent, filling someone's car with sugar is destructive and wrong.\n\nSo, based on this, I think both scenarios depict actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
