The options are:\n\nA. Pleasure\n\nB. Reproduction\n\nC. To maintain the double standard\n\nD. To relieve tension\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what sociobiology is. I think it's a field that combines sociological and biological perspectives to understand social behavior, including human behavior. So, in this case, it's about understanding sexual behavior from both social and biological standpoints.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the central function of sex according to sociobiologists. Let's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Pleasure\n\nSex is indeed associated with pleasure. Many people engage in sexual activities for the enjoyment and pleasure they derive from them. However, is pleasure the central function from a sociobiological perspective? I doubt it. Pleasure might be a byproduct or a motivator, but it's not the primary function.\n\nOption B: Reproduction\n\nReproduction seems like a obvious choice. Biologically, sex is a means to combine genetic material from two parents to produce offspring. This is a fundamental aspect of many species, including humans. Sociobiologists would likely view reproduction as a key function of sex because it relates directly to passing on genes to the next generation, which is a central theme in evolutionary biology.\n\nOption C: To maintain the double standard\n\nThis one sounds a bit tricky. The \"double standard\" typically refers to different expectations or rules for different groups, often men and women, regarding sexual behavior. While social norms and double standards do influence sexual behavior, I don't think maintaining the double standard is the central function of sex from a sociobiological perspective. This seems more related to cultural and social constructions rather than biological imperatives.\n\nOption D: To relieve tension\n\nSex can certainly help relieve tension, both emotional and physical. It's a stress-reliever for many people. However, similar to pleasure, I think this is more of a byproduct of sexual activity rather than its central function, especially from a sociobiological point of view.\n\nAfter considering all the options, I believe that reproduction is the central function of sex according to sociobiologists. It's the biological basis for why sex exists in the first place, as it serves the purpose of procreation and passing on one's genes to future generations.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it a bit more. Sociobiology emphasizes the role of natural selection in shaping social behaviors. Reproduction is directly tied to fitness and the propagation of genes, which aligns with the principles of natural selection. Pleasure and tension relief, while important for individual well-being, don't directly contribute to gene propagation in the same way.\n\nAs for the double standard, while it may influence sexual behavior in society, it's more of a social construct and not a biological function of sex.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. Reproduction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
