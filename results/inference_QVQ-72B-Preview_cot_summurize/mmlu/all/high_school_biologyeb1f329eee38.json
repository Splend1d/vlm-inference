                    "text": "Let's see here. So, mosquitoes resistant to DDT first appeared in India in 1959, and this was about 15 years after DDT started being sprayed everywhere. The question is asking which statement best explains how these resistant mosquitoes came about. There are four options, and I need to pick the one that makes the most sense based on what I know about evolution and natural selection.\n\nOption A says that some mosquitoes experienced a mutation after being exposed to DDT that made them resistant, and then their population expanded because these mosquitoes had no competition. Hmm, that sounds a bit like the mutation happened in response to the DDT. But from what I remember in biology class, mutations are random and happen before the selection pressure is applied. So, it's not entirely accurate to say that the mutation occurred after exposure to DDT. Maybe this isn't the best explanation.\n\nOption B says that some mosquitoes were already resistant to DDT when DDT was first sprayed, and then their population expanded because all the susceptible mosquitoes were exterminated. This seems more in line with natural selection. Before DDT was used, there were probably some mosquitoes that had a resistance gene, maybe due to random mutations. When DDT was sprayed, it killed the mosquitoes without resistance, but the resistant ones survived and could reproduce more because their competitors were eliminated. So, their population grew. This sounds plausible.\n\nOption C suggests that DDT is generally very effective, so if resistance developed, it must have been because it was manufactured improperly. Well, DDT is known to be an effective insecticide, but resistance can develop in pest populations regardless of how it's manufactured. Resistance is a natural outcome of evolution when a population is exposed to a selective pressure like a pesticide. So, blaming improper manufacturing seems unfounded. I don't think this is the right answer.\n\nOption D says that although DDT is effective against a wide range of insects, it's not effective against mosquitoes. But that can't be right, because the question clearly states that mosquitoes resistant to DDT appeared in 1959. If DDT wasn't effective against mosquitoes, there wouldn't be resistance developing in the first place. So, this option contradicts the information given in the question.\n\nBetween options A and B, B seems to align better with the principles of natural selection. Mutations occur randomly, and when a new environment pressure is introduced, like DDT, those with favorable traits (in this case, resistance) have a better chance of surviving and reproducing. So, their population expands not because they have no competition, but because their competitors were killed off by DDT.\n\nWait a minute, in option A, it says \"they had no competition.\" That might not be entirely accurate. Even if susceptible mosquitoes were killed, there might still be competition among the resistant mosquitoes for resources. But the main point is that the resistant mosquitoes had a selective advantage because they could survive DDT, which allowed their population to grow.\n\nOption B is clearer in that it states that the resistant mosquitoes expanded because the susceptible ones were exterminated, which aligns with the concept of natural selection.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is option B.\n\nJust to make sure, let me recap what I know about natural selection:\n\n1. Variations exist within populations due to random mutations.\n\n2. Some of these variations provide an advantage in a particular environment.\n\n3. Individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce.\n\n4. Over time, the frequency of these advantageous traits increases in the population.\n\nIn this scenario, the advantageous trait is resistance to DDT. Before DDT was used, there were probably some mosquitoes with natural resistance due to random mutations. When DDT was sprayed, it acted as a selective pressure, killing the susceptible mosquitoes but allowing the resistant ones to survive and reproduce. As a result, the resistant mosquitoes became more prevalent in the population.\n\nYes, that matches option B perfectly. So, I'm confident that B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
