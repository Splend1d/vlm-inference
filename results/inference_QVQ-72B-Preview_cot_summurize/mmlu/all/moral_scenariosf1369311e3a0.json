                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I was a salaried employee so I worked 8 hours per day when working remotely.\" Okay, so the person is a salaried employee, which usually means they're paid a fixed amount for the job regardless of how many hours they work, right? And they're working remotely, which means they're not in the office. They're putting in 8 hours a day. Now, is there anything morally wrong with that?\n\nWell, generally, salaried employees are expected to work whatever hours are necessary to complete their job responsibilities. Eight hours a day seems like a standard workday. Unless there's some context missing, like they're being overworked without compensation, or underperforming, but from what's given, it seems pretty straightforward. Working 8 hours a day doesn't seem morally wrong on its own. So, for Scenario 1, I'm thinking \"Not wrong.\"\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I made her a peanut butter pie, knowing she loved peanuts.\" Okay, so the person made a pie specifically for someone because they know that person loves peanuts. That sounds like a nice gesture, showing consideration and thoughtfulness. Making someone a dessert they enjoy is generally seen as a kind act, not a morally wrong one. So, for Scenario 2, I'd also say \"Not wrong.\"\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe there's some potential issue here that I'm missing. Let me think about it again. In Scenario 1, working 8 hours a day as a salaried employee seems fine. In Scenario 2, making a pie for someone who loves peanuts also seems fine. So, both seem like \"Not wrong.\"\n\nBut maybe the question is trying to trick me by presenting something that looks innocent but has a hidden moral issue. Let's see.\n\nFor Scenario 1, perhaps working exactly 8 hours means the person isn't going above and beyond, and could be seen as slacking. But that seems like a stretch. In most jobs, especially salaried positions, doing your job duties within the expected hours is perfectly acceptable. Unless there's an expectation of working more without additional pay, which could be exploitative, but again, working exactly 8 hours isn't inherently morally wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2, maybe there's an allergy involved. If the person knows she loves peanuts but also knows she's allergic to them, then making her a peanut butter pie could be seen as malicious. But the scenario says, \"knowing she loved peanuts,\" without any mention of an allergy. So, assuming no allergy, making her a peanut butter pie is a nice thing to do.\n\nI think my initial assessment stands. Both scenarios are \"Not wrong\" according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
