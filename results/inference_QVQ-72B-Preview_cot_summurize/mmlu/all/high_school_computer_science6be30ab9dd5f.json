                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to figure out how much electronic storage is required for all the text in the university's libraries, and then determine the best unit to measure it. The options are megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes, and petabytes. I'm a bit rusty on my powers of two, but I remember that each step up in these units is a multiplication by 1024, which is approximately a factor of 1000 in the decimal system.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the given assumptions:\n\n1. Total number of books: 3 million.\n\n2. Average pages per book: 400.\n\n3. Average lines per page: 50.\n\n4. Average words per line: 10.\n\n5. Average characters per word: 5.\n\n6. Each character is represented by 1 byte.\n\nMy goal is to find the total storage required in bytes and then convert that to a more manageable unit from the options given.\n\nLet me start by calculating the total number of characters in all the books.\n\nFirst, find the total number of pages in all books:\n\n3,000,000 books \u00d7 400 pages/book = 1,200,000,000 pages.\n\nNext, the total number of lines in all pages:\n\n1,200,000,000 pages \u00d7 50 lines/page = 60,000,000,000 lines.\n\nThen, the total number of words in all lines:\n\n60,000,000,000 lines \u00d7 10 words/line = 600,000,000,000 words.\n\nAfter that, the total number of characters in all words:\n\n600,000,000,000 words \u00d7 5 characters/word = 3,000,000,000,000 characters.\n\nSince each character is 1 byte, the total storage required is 3,000,000,000,000 bytes.\n\nNow, I need to convert this to the most appropriate unit from the options provided.\n\nLet's recall the definitions:\n\n- 1 megabyte (MB) = 2^20 bytes \u2248 1,048,576 bytes.\n\n- 1 gigabyte (GB) = 2^30 bytes \u2248 1,073,741,824 bytes.\n\n- 1 terabyte (TB) = 2^40 bytes \u2248 1,099,511,627,776 bytes.\n\n- 1 petabyte (PB) = 2^50 bytes \u2248 1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes.\n\nAlternatively, in decimal terms:\n\n- 1 GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes.\n\n- 1 TB = 1,000,000,000,000 bytes.\n\n- 1 PB = 1,000,000,000,000,000 bytes.\n\nGiven that, let's use the decimal approximation for simplicity.\n\nTotal bytes: 3,000,000,000,000 bytes.\n\nLet's convert to gigabytes:\n\n3,000,000,000,000 bytes \u00f7 1,000,000,000 bytes/GB = 3,000 GB.\n\nThat's 3,000 gigabytes. But that seems quite large. Maybe terabytes would be a better unit.\n\nConvert to terabytes:\n\n3,000,000,000,000 bytes \u00f7 1,000,000,000,000 bytes/TB = 3 TB.\n\nThree terabytes seems manageable and is a common unit for storage these days.\n\nAlternatively, let's check with petabytes:\n\n3,000,000,000,000 bytes \u00f7 1,000,000,000,000,000 bytes/PB = 0.003 PB.\n\nWhile 3 TB is already a meaningful number, 0.003 PB is also correct, but it's less intuitive.\n\nConsidering the options, 3 TB is a reasonable and straightforward measurement.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting with the number of books: 3,000,000.\n\nPages per book: 400.\n\nTotal pages: 3,000,000 \u00d7 400 = 1,200,000,000 pages.\n\nLines per page: 50.\n\nTotal lines: 1,200,000,000 \u00d7 50 = 60,000,000,000 lines.\n\nWords per line: 10.\n\nTotal words: 60,000,000,000 \u00d7 10 = 600,000,000,000 words.\n\nCharacters per word: 5.\n\nTotal characters: 600,000,000,000 \u00d7 5 = 3,000,000,000,000 characters.\n\nBytes: 3,000,000,000,000 bytes.\n\nConvert to TB:\n\n3,000,000,000,000 \u00f7 1,000,000,000,000 = 3 TB.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, are there spaces between words? Punctuation marks? Normally, spaces and punctuation are also characters, but since the problem specifies \"letters/characters,\" and considering that spaces and punctuation are also part of the text, perhaps they are included in the average characters per word.\n\nHowever, to be precise, perhaps I should consider that each word is separated by a space, which is an additional character. If each word is followed by a space, that would add approximately one extra character per word.\n\nSo, total characters including spaces would be:\n\nTotal words: 600,000,000,000.\n\nEach word followed by a space: 600,000,000,000 spaces.\n\nTotal characters including spaces: 600,000,000,000 \u00d7 5 + 600,000,000,000 \u00d7 1 = 3,600,000,000,000 characters.\n\nBut wait, this seems off because in standard text, spaces are part of the total characters. However, in programming and data storage, text is often stored without considering the spaces separately, as they are just part of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider only the alphanumeric characters, excluding spaces.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, I'll stick with the initial calculation, assuming that the \"characters per word\" includes all characters within words, and spaces are additional. However, in my earlier calculation, I only considered characters within words, not the spaces.\n\nLet me correct this.\n\nIf each word is followed by a space, then for every word, there is one space character.\n\nTherefore, total characters including spaces would be:\n\nTotal word characters: 3,000,000,000,000 characters.\n\nTotal space characters: 600,000,000,000 spaces.\n\nTotal characters including spaces: 3,000,000,000,000 + 600,000,000,000 = 3,600,000,000,000 characters.\n\nThus, total bytes: 3,600,000,000,000 bytes.\n\nConvert to terabytes:\n\n3,600,000,000,000 \u00f7 1,000,000,000,000 = 3.6 TB.\n\nSo, including spaces, it would be 3.6 terabytes.\n\nNow, which is the best unit to measure this storage?\n\nOption C is terabytes, which is 10^12 bytes, and 3 TB is 3 \u00d7 10^12 bytes, which matches our calculation.\n\nOption D is petabytes, which is 10^15 bytes, and 3 TB is 0.003 PB, which is also correct but less conventional.\n\nGiven that terabytes are a commonly used unit for measuring storage capacities, especially in libraries and digital archives, 3 TB is a meaningful and understandable measure.\n\nMoreover, petabytes are typically used for much larger datasets, such as those handled by internet companies or national archives.\n\nTherefore, the best unit to measure the electronic storage required for the text in all the books of the university's libraries is terabytes.\n\nSo, the answer is C. Terabyte (2^40 or approximately 10^12 bytes).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
