                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about hydrangea flowers and their color variation based on the type of soil they're grown in. So, hydrangeas have one gene that determines their flower color, but the actual color can range from blue to pink depending on the soil. The question is asking which statement best explains this phenomenon.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's going on. Hydrangeas have a single gene for flower color, but the expression of that color is influenced by the environment, specifically the type of soil. So, genetics is playing a role, but so is the environment.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. The alleles for flower color show incomplete dominance, where neither trait is dominant; expression of the genes shows a blending of traits.\n\nHmm, incomplete dominance means that both alleles contribute to the phenotype, and the heterozygote is somewhere in between the two homozygotes. But in this case, the color isn't just blending between two options based on genetics; it's varying from blue to pink based on the soil type. So, maybe this isn't the best fit.\n\nB. The alleles for flower color are codominant; both traits show depending on the environment.\n\nCodominance is when both alleles are fully expressed in the heterozygote, leading to both traits being visible. But again, here the color is changing based on the soil, not just expressing both traits simultaneously. Maybe not the right choice.\n\nC. In this case, the environment alters the expression of a trait.\n\nThis seems plausible. The gene is there, but the environment (soil type) is influencing how that gene is expressed, leading to different flower colors. This sounds like a classic example of environmental influence on gene expression.\n\nD. The genes for flower color show polygenic inheritance.\n\nPolygenic inheritance involves multiple genes contributing to a single trait, often resulting in a continuous range of phenotypes. But the question states that there's only one gene involved in flower color determination. So, this can't be polygenic inheritance.\n\nLet me double-check. If there's only one gene for flower color, but the color varies widely based on soil type, it's clear that the environment is playing a significant role in how that gene is expressed.\n\nI think the best explanation is option C: the environment alters the expression of a trait.\n\nWait, but let's think deeper. Is there any chance that the soil could be affecting the gene expression in a way that changes the flower color?\n\nYes, because soil acidity affects the availability of aluminum ions, which in turn affects the color of hydrangea flowers. In acidic soils, more aluminum is available, which can lead to blue flowers, whereas in alkaline soils, less aluminum is available, leading to pink flowers.\n\nSo, it's not that the gene itself is changing, but the environment is influencing how the gene is expressed, resulting in different flower colors.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct choice: the environment alters the expression of a trait.\n\nI don't think it's A, B, or D, because those options are more about genetic interactions, whereas this situation is about environmental influence on gene expression.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any genetic mixing or multiple genes involved.\n\nThe problem states that plants are of the same genetic variety, meaning they have the same genotype, but their phenotype (flower color) varies based on soil type.\n\nSo, since they're the same genetic variety, any variation in phenotype must be due to environmental factors, not genetic differences.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: in this case, the environment alters the expression of a trait.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
