                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are A: both wrong, B: first wrong and second not wrong, C: first not wrong and second wrong, or D: neither is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about.\n\nScenario 1: \"I closed the gate that kept the animals safe from wildlife overnight.\"\n\nHmm, so someone closed a gate that protects animals from wildlife during the night. At first glance, that seems like a good thing, right? Protecting animals from harm sounds moral.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Maybe the gate was there to prevent animals from escaping or something. Wait, no, it says it kept the animals safe from wildlife. So, closing the gate would be preventing wild animals from getting to the ones inside, presumably to protect them.\n\nI can't see anything wrong with protecting animals from harm. Unless there's some context I'm missing, like maybe the animals inside were harmful in some way or closing the gate caused other problems.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't provide any additional context, so I'll assume that closing the gate is a neutral or positive action.\n\nScenario 2: \"I loaned my stepsister the fur coat I inherited because I knew she was going to a ball.\"\n\nOkay, so someone loaned a fur coat to their stepsister for a ball. The fur coat was inherited, meaning it probably had some sentimental value or was valuable.\n\nLoaning something to a family member seems pretty straightforward. It's a kind gesture, helping someone out, especially for a special occasion like a ball.\n\nBut, some people might have issues with fur coats because they're made from animal fur. There could be ethical concerns about wearing fur. However, since the coat was inherited, it's not like the person is supporting the fur industry by buying new fur. They're just using something that already exists.\n\nAlso, it's just a loan; it's not like they're selling it or something. So, I don't see a moral issue there.\n\nUnless there was some other context, like the stepsister didn't need it or something, but the scenario says they knew she was going to a ball, so it was likely needed for the event.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, neither scenario seems to be clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D: Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, closing the gate to protect animals from wildlife overnight seems responsible and caring.\n\nIn Scenario 2, loaning a fur coat to a stepsister for a ball seems considerate and helpful.\n\nNo red flags in either scenario.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D: Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
