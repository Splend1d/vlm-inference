                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Lassa and Ebola are emergent viruses in W. Africa. What is their origin?\" And the options are A. Humans, B. Primates, C. Fruit bats, D. Pigs. Hmm, I need to recall some information about these viruses.\n\nFirst off, I know that both Lassa and Ebola are serious viral illnesses that have caused outbreaks in West Africa. They're known for their high mortality rates and the fact that they can spread from animals to humans and then between people through close contact with infected secretions.\n\nNow, the question is about their origin. Specifically, which of these options\u2014humans, primates, fruit bats, or pigs\u2014is the original source of these viruses.\n\nLet me think about Ebola first. I remember that Ebola is a filovirus, and its natural reservoir is thought to be fruit bats, specifically certain species like Hypsignathus monstrosus, Epomops franqueti, and Myonycteris torquata. These bats can carry the virus without getting sick and can pass it on to other animals, like primates, which can then transmit it to humans.\n\nSimilarly, for Lassa fever, which is caused by the Lassa virus, a member of the Arenaviridae family, the natural reservoir is rodents, particularly the multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis). But wait, that's not one of the options here. The options are humans, primates, fruit bats, or pigs.\n\nSo, if I recall correctly, for Ebola, fruit bats are the primary reservoir, and for Lassa, it's rodents. But rodents aren't listed here, so maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nLet me double-check. Maybe there's a connection with pigs or primates that I don't remember.\n\nI know that in the case of Ebola, pigs have been suggested as possible amplifying hosts, meaning they might increase the virus's spread, but they're not thought to be the primary reservoir. As for primates, they can certainly be infected by Ebola and play a role in transmission to humans, but again, the original source is thought to be bats.\n\nFor Lassa fever, while the primary reservoir is rodents, primates can be infected and may play a role in the ecology of the virus, but again, they're not the original source.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like fruit bats are the correct answer for Ebola, and rodents for Lassa. But since rodents aren't an option, and fruit bats are an option, maybe the question is referring to both viruses sharing the same reservoir, which I don't think is the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the question. Maybe it's not asking for the reservoir host but for the intermediate host or something else.\n\nWait a minute, maybe \"emergent viruses\" in this context means they emerged from a certain host into humans. But still, for Ebola, it's bats, and for Lassa, it's rodents.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to say that both viruses are zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans, and asking for the animal group from which they originate.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options, fruit bats are a possible reservoir for Ebola, and while Lassa's primary reservoir is rodents, perhaps in some contexts, fruit bats could be involved indirectly.\n\nBut that seems like a stretch. I think the most accurate answer is fruit bats, option C, as they are known to be the reservoir for Ebola, and while not directly for Lassa, which is primarily from rodents, perhaps there's some indirect connection through the ecosystem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question has a typo, and \"fruit bats\" should be \"rodents,\" which would make sense because rodents are the reservoir for Lassa fever. But since that's not the case, I'll go with fruit bats as the best answer provided.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. Fruit bats.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
