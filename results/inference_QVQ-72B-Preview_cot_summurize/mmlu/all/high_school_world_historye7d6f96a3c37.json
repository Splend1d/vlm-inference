                    "text": "So I've got this quote here from historian Alfred Crosby, and it's about the Spanish invaders bringing over various plants from Eurasia and Africa to the Americas. It mentions things like wheat, peach trees, pears, oranges, lemons, chick-peas, grape vines, melons, onions, radishes, and more. Then it says that a Spanish nobleman in America could require his Indians to furnish his table with these fruits of his ancestors.\n\nThe question is asking what economic practice is referred to by the phrase \"his Indians\" in the quote. The options are slavery, indentured servitude, the encomienda system, or the apprentice system.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"his Indians\" means in this context. It seems like it's referring to the indigenous people in the Americas who were under the control or command of the Spanish noblemen.\n\nLet's recall some historical background. When the Spanish conquered the Americas, they implemented various systems to exploit the resources and labor of the indigenous people.\n\nOption A is slavery. Slavery was certainly practiced by the Spanish in the Americas, especially after the arrival of African slaves. However, the term \"his Indians\" seems more specific to the indigenous people rather than African slaves.\n\nOption B is indentured servitude. This was a system where people voluntarily signed contracts to work for a certain number of years in exchange for passage to the New World or other benefits. But again, this seems more related to European or African migrants rather than indigenous people.\n\nOption C is the encomienda system. Now, this rings a bell. The encomienda was a labor system instituted by the Spanish in their American colonies. It granted a colonist the right to demand taxes or labor from a group of indigenous people in return for protecting and converting them to Christianity. Essentially, it gave the encomendero (the grant holder) control over the labor and lives of the indigenous people under his encomienda.\n\nOption D is the apprentice system. This was more common in Europe, where young people learned trades by working under skilled craftsmen. It doesn't seem to fit the context of indigenous labor in the Americas.\n\nGiven this information, the encomienda system seems the most fitting answer. It was specifically designed for the control and exploitation of indigenous labor in the Spanish colonies, which aligns with the phrase \"his Indians\" in the quote.\n\nBut wait, let's think deeper. The encomienda system was supposed to involve protection and Christianization of the indigenous people, but in practice, it often led to severe exploitation and abuse. The noblemen would require the indigenous people to work in mines, on plantations, or in domestic service, often under harsh conditions.\n\nIn the quote, it says that a Spanish nobleman could require his Indians to furnish his table with the fruits of his ancestors. This suggests that the nobleman had the authority to command the labor of the indigenous people for his personal benefit, which aligns with the encomienda system where encomenderos had the right to demand labor or goods from the indigenous people under their control.\n\nSlavery, while prevalent in the Spanish colonies, particularly involving African slaves, might not be the primary interpretation here because the phrase is \"his Indians,\" which seems to specifically refer to indigenous people.\n\nIndentured servitude was more common with European migrants or, in some cases, Africans, but not typically with indigenous people, who were often subjected to different labor systems.\n\nThe apprentice system doesn't fit here, as it was more about vocational training and wasn't a primary economic practice involving indigenous labor in the Spanish colonies.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is C. The encomienda system.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider another angle. The encomienda system was established in the 16th century as a way to organize the labor of indigenous people in the Spanish colonies. It was intended to facilitate the extraction of wealth and the spread of Christianity, but it often resulted in the severe mistreatment of indigenous populations.\n\nThe quote mentions that the Spanish noblemen could require the indigenous people to provide them with fruits and other goods from their ancestors, which suggests that the noblemen had the power to demand resources from the indigenous people, which is consistent with the encomienda system.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. The encomienda system.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
