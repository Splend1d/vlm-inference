                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question about the coffee market. It says that the market is currently in equilibrium, which means that the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded at the current price. Now, the question is asking which of the given options would most likely result in an increase in the demand for coffee.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what affects demand. Demand is influenced by several factors, including consumer income, prices of related goods, consumer preferences, expectations of future prices, and the number of buyers in the market. Since coffee is described as a normal good, that means that as consumer income increases, demand for coffee also increases. Conversely, if income decreases, demand would decrease.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Consumer income falls.\n\nSince coffee is a normal good, a decrease in consumer income would lead to a decrease in demand for coffee, not an increase. So, this seems unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\nOption B: The price of tea rises.\n\nTea is a substitute for coffee. If the price of tea rises, it makes tea relatively more expensive compared to coffee. This could make consumers switch from tea to coffee, thereby increasing the demand for coffee. This seems like a possible answer.\n\nOption C: The wage of coffee plantation workers falls.\n\nThis might affect the cost of production for coffee, but the question is about demand, not supply. If wages fall, it could make production cheaper, which might increase supply, but that's not directly related to demand. So, this doesn't seem to directly affect demand for coffee.\n\nOption D: Technology in the harvesting of coffee beans improves.\n\nImproved technology in harvesting could make production more efficient, reducing costs and potentially increasing supply. Again, this is more related to supply than demand. Better technology might make coffee cheaper, which could increase demand indirectly by making it more affordable, but the question is asking for the most likely direct effect on demand.\n\nGiven these considerations, option B seems to be the most straightforward choice for increasing demand for coffee. When the price of a substitute good (tea) increases, it typically leads to an increase in demand for the substitute (coffee).\n\nJust to double-check, let's think about it in terms of the determinants of demand. The price of related goods is a key factor in determining demand. Since tea and coffee are substitutes, an increase in the price of tea would make coffee relatively cheaper and more attractive to consumers, thus increasing its demand.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a decrease in consumer income would decrease demand for a normal good like coffee. Option C and D seem to affect supply more directly than demand, although improved technology or lower wages might lead to increased supply, which could then affect price and demand indirectly, but the question is about what would most likely increase demand directly.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is Option B: The price of tea rises.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
