The options are:\n\nA. no earlier than 80,000 years ago\n\nB. soon after 60,000 years ago\n\nC. soon after 40,000 years ago\n\nD. no earlier than 20,000 years ago\n\nI need to figure out which one is correct. I'm not an expert in archaeology, but I do remember learning something about this in school.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what the current consensus is among experts. Archaeologists use various methods to date sites and artifacts, like carbon dating, to determine when humans first set foot in a region. In Australia, there have been numerous digs that have uncovered tools and remains that can give us clues about early human presence.\n\nLet me think about some of the key sites or findings that might help me here. For instance, Lake Mungo in New South Wales is famous for its ancient human remains. I think the oldest human remains found there were dated to around 40,000 years ago, but I might be mistaken.\n\nWait, I think recent dating has pushed that back. Maybe it's older than that. Let me try to recall.\n\nAlso, there are sites in northern Australia, like Nawarla Gabarnmang, which has rock art that has been dated to over 17,000 years ago, but that's more recent than some of the options here.\n\nI think the earliest occupation sites in Australia are older than that. Maybe around 60,000 years ago?\n\nLet me consider the options again:\n\nA. no earlier than 80,000 years ago\n\nB. soon after 60,000 years ago\n\nC. soon after 40,000 years ago\n\nD. no earlier than 20,000 years ago\n\nOption A is 80,000 years ago, which seems quite early. I don't think the consensus is that early. Maybe B, soon after 60,000 years ago, is more accurate.\n\nOption C, soon after 40,000 years ago, might be too recent, based on what I recall about Lake Mungo and other sites.\n\nOption D, no earlier than 20,000 years ago, seems too recent. That's towards the end of the last ice age, and I think humans were in Australia before that.\n\nLet me try to recall some specific dates. I think there's a site called Madjedbebe, which has been dated to around 65,000 years ago. That was mentioned in the news a few years back.\n\nAlso, there's a study that placed the first human arrival in Australia around 65,000 years ago, based on genetic evidence and archaeological findings.\n\nSo, that would point towards option B, soon after 60,000 years ago.\n\nBut what about option A, no earlier than 80,000 years ago? Is there any evidence to support that?\n\nI did a quick search in my mind and couldn't recall any sites in Australia that have been reliably dated to older than 60,000 years ago. Madjedbebe is around 65,000 years ago, which is consistent with option B.\n\nMaybe option A is a distractor, or perhaps there are some claims of earlier occupation, but they aren't widely accepted.\n\nI should also consider the context of human migration out of Africa. The earliest widely accepted human remains outside of Africa are around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago in places like the Middle East and India.\n\nSo, if humans left Africa around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago, and Australia is further east, it makes sense that it would be colonized shortly after that.\n\nTherefore, option B seems plausible.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider why the other options might be incorrect.\n\nOption C, soon after 40,000 years ago, is too recent. We have evidence of human presence in Australia that's much older than that.\n\nOption D, no earlier than 20,000 years ago, is even more recent, falling towards the end of the last ice age, when sea levels were much lower, which might have made it easier to reach Australia, but humans were already there by then.\n\nOption A, no earlier than 80,000 years ago, might be based on some earlier theories or limited evidence, but the current consensus seems to favor around 60,000 years ago.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. soon after 60,000 years ago.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
