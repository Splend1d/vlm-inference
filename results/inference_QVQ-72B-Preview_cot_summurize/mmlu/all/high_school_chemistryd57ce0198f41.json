                    "text": "So I have this problem here about partial pressures in a mixture of gases. There are three gases in a sealed, rigid container: nitrogen, argon, and water vapor. I'm given the masses of each gas: 28.0 g of nitrogen, 40.0 g of argon, and 36.0 g of water vapor. The total pressure inside the container is 2.0 atm, and I need to find the partial pressure of the nitrogen. The options are A. 0.33 atm, B. 0.40 atm, C. 0.50 atm, and D. 2.0 atm.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall what partial pressure is. Partial pressure is the pressure that each individual gas in a mixture would exert if it were alone in the same volume and at the same temperature. The total pressure of the mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases. That's Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures.\n\nSo, if I have three gases, their partial pressures add up to the total pressure:\n\nP_total = P_N\u2082 + P_Ar + P_H\u2082O\n\nI need to find P_N\u2082, and I know P_total is 2.0 atm.\n\nNow, to find the partial pressure of each gas, I can use the concept of mole fractions. The mole fraction of a gas is the fraction of the total moles of gas that is that particular gas. The partial pressure of a gas is equal to its mole fraction times the total pressure.\n\nSo, P_i = X_i * P_total\n\nWhere X_i is the mole fraction of gas i.\n\nTherefore, to find P_N\u2082, I need to find the mole fraction of nitrogen and multiply it by the total pressure.\n\nBut first, I need to find the mole fraction of nitrogen. To do that, I need to know the number of moles of nitrogen and the total number of moles of all gases.\n\nI know the masses of each gas, so I can find their moles by dividing the mass by their respective molar masses.\n\nFirst, let's find the molar masses:\n\n- Nitrogen (N\u2082): approximately 28 g/mol\n\n- Argon (Ar): approximately 40 g/mol\n\n- Water vapor (H\u2082O): approximately 18 g/mol\n\nWait, the problem says water vapor is 36.0 g. Let me confirm the molar mass of water. Yes, it's 18.0 g/mol.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of moles for each gas:\n\n- Moles of nitrogen (n_N\u2082) = mass / molar mass = 28.0 g / 28 g/mol = 1.0 mol\n\n- Moles of argon (n_Ar) = 40.0 g / 40 g/mol = 1.0 mol\n\n- Moles of water vapor (n_H\u2082O) = 36.0 g / 18 g/mol = 2.0 mol\n\nSo, total moles (n_total) = n_N\u2082 + n_Ar + n_H\u2082O = 1.0 + 1.0 + 2.0 = 4.0 mol\n\nNow, the mole fraction of nitrogen (X_N\u2082) is:\n\nX_N\u2082 = n_N\u2082 / n_total = 1.0 / 4.0 = 0.25\n\nTherefore, the partial pressure of nitrogen (P_N\u2082) is:\n\nP_N\u2082 = X_N\u2082 * P_total = 0.25 * 2.0 atm = 0.50 atm\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 0.50 atm seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the molar masses:\n\n- N\u2082: 28 g/mol (yes)\n\n- Ar: 40 g/mol (yes)\n\n- H\u2082O: 18 g/mol (yes)\n\nThen, moles calculation:\n\n- N\u2082: 28.0 g / 28 g/mol = 1.0 mol (correct)\n\n- Ar: 40.0 g / 40 g/mol = 1.0 mol (correct)\n\n- H\u2082O: 36.0 g / 18 g/mol = 2.0 mol (correct)\n\nTotal moles: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 mol (correct)\n\nMole fraction of N\u2082: 1 / 4 = 0.25 (correct)\n\nPartial pressure: 0.25 * 2.0 atm = 0.50 atm (correct)\n\nI think that's solid. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the ideal gas law for each gas and calculate the partial pressure that way.\n\nThe ideal gas law is P * V = n * R * T\n\nBut since the container is rigid and sealed, the volume is constant, and assuming temperature is constant as well, I can set up the equation for each gas.\n\nBut actually, since I don't have individual volumes or temperatures, that might not be helpful. Plus, I don't have values for R or T given here.\n\nAnother thought: since it's a mixture of gases, and they're all at the same temperature and volume, the partial pressure depends only on the mole fraction, as I've already used.\n\nSo, I think my initial approach is valid and correct.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider the total pressure calculation.\n\nTotal pressure is the sum of the partial pressures:\n\nP_total = P_N\u2082 + P_Ar + P_H\u2082O = 0.50 atm + P_Ar + P_H\u2082O\n\nBut since P_Ar = X_Ar * P_total and P_H\u2082O = X_H\u2082O * P_total\n\nGiven that X_Ar = 1.0 / 4 = 0.25 and X_H\u2082O = 2.0 / 4 = 0.50\n\nSo, P_Ar = 0.25 * 2.0 atm = 0.50 atm\n\nP_H\u2082O = 0.50 * 2.0 atm = 1.0 atm\n\nTherefore, P_total = 0.50 atm (N\u2082) + 0.50 atm (Ar) + 1.0 atm (H\u2082O) = 2.0 atm, which matches the given total pressure.\n\nThis consistency checks out, so I'm confident that the partial pressure of nitrogen is indeed 0.50 atm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ 0.50\\ \\text{atm}} \\]"
