                    "text": "So the CPI, which is the Consumer Price Index, has gone from 120 to 150. I need to figure out by how much the prices have changed. The options are:\n\nA. risen 20 percent.\n\nB. risen 25 percent.\n\nC. fallen 30 percent.\n\nD. risen 30 percent.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what CPI represents. The CPI measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. So, if the CPI has increased from 120 to 150, that means that the cost of this basket of goods and services has increased by that percentage.\n\nTo find out the percentage change, I can use the formula for percentage change, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage change} = \\frac{\\text{new value} - \\text{old value}}{\\text{old value}} \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage change} = \\frac{150 - 120}{120} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{30}{120} \\times 100\\% = 0.25 \\times 100\\% = 25\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, according to this calculation, the prices have risen by 25 percent. That would make the correct answer option B.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something. The question is asking for the change from 120 to 150. Another way to think about this is to find the factor by which the CPI has increased.\n\nStarting with 120, to get to 150, you multiply by 1.25 because \\(120 \\times 1.25 = 150\\). To express this as a percentage increase, \\(1.25 = 125\\%\\), but since the base was 100%, the increase is \\(125\\% - 100\\% = 25\\%\\).\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of index points. The CPI increased by 30 points (from 120 to 150). To find the percentage increase, divide the change by the original value and multiply by 100%:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{30}{120} \\times 100\\% = 25\\%\n\\]\n\nThis again confirms that the prices have risen by 25%.\n\nWait a minute, option A says risen 20 percent. Let's see what that would correspond to in terms of CPI.\n\nIf prices rose by 20%, then the new CPI would be \\(120 \\times 1.20 = 144\\), but the actual new CPI is 150, which is higher than 144. So, 20% increase is not sufficient to reach 150.\n\nOption C says fallen 30 percent. That doesn't make sense because the CPI has clearly increased from 120 to 150, so prices have risen, not fallen.\n\nOption D says risen 30 percent. Let's check if that's accurate.\n\nIf prices rose by 30%, then the new CPI would be \\(120 \\times 1.30 = 156\\), but the actual new CPI is 150, which is less than 156. So, 30% increase is too high.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. risen 25 percent.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other factor that could affect this calculation. For example, if the basket of goods and services changed, but in this problem, it's assumed that the CPI directly measures price changes, so I don't need to account for any changes in the basket.\n\nAlso, sometimes CPI is adjusted for inflation or other economic factors, but again, in this problem, it's straightforward: the CPI increased from 120 to 150, and we need to find the percentage increase.\n\nSo, after double-checking with different methods, I'm confident that the answer is B. risen 25 percent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
