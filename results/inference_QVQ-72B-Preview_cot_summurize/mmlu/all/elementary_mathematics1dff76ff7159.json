                    "text": "So I have this equation here: 24 = 2p. I need to find the value of p. Let's see, I think I should solve for p. Hmm, maybe I can start by dividing both sides of the equation by 2. That should give me p by itself on one side.\n\nSo, if I divide both sides by 2, I get:\n\n24 \u00f7 2 = 2p \u00f7 2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n12 = p\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, p equals 12. But let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could subtract 2p from both sides or something, but that might complicate things. No, I think dividing both sides by 2 is the simpler approach.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other step I should take or if maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing. The question is pretty direct: \"What is the value of p in 24 = 2p?\" And the options are p = 4, p = 8, p = 12, and p = 24.\n\nSo, according to my calculation, p should be 12. Let me just plug in the value to make sure.\n\nIf p = 12, then 2p = 2 * 12 = 24, which matches the equation. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but why is option D p = 24? That doesn't make sense because if p were 24, then 2p would be 48, which doesn't equal 24. So that's definitely not the answer.\n\nOption A is p = 4. If p = 4, then 2p = 8, which doesn't equal 24. So that's incorrect.\n\nOption B is p = 8. Then 2p = 16, which also doesn't match 24.\n\nOption C is p = 12. As I calculated, 2 * 12 = 24, which matches the equation.\n\nSo, based on this, p = 12 is the correct answer. I don't think there's any trick here; it's a straightforward equation to solve.\n\nMaybe I should consider if there's any other interpretation, like units or something, but the question doesn't provide any context beyond the equation.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. The value of p in the equation 24 = 2p is p = 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
