                    "text": "So I have this problem here about a voltmeter and its accuracy. The voltmeter has a full scale reading of 100 volts, and it's guaranteed to be accurate within 2% of that full scale. The measurement it's showing is 75 volts, and I need to find out what the limiting error is in percentage terms. The options are 3.33%, 2.66%, 2%, or 1%.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"accuracy of 2% of full scale reading\" means. Does it mean that the voltmeter can be off by up to 2% of the full scale value, which is 100 volts? Let me calculate that.\n\n2% of 100 volts is (2/100) * 100 = 2 volts. So, the voltmeter could be off by up to 2 volts in either direction. That means if it reads 75 volts, the actual voltage could be between 73 and 77 volts.\n\nBut the question is asking for the limiting error in percentage. So, I need to express this possible error as a percentage of the measured value, which is 75 volts.\n\nFirst, find the absolute error, which is 2 volts.\n\nThen, to find the relative error in percentage, I use the formula:\n\nRelative error (%) = (Absolute error / Measured value) * 100\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nRelative error (%) = (2 / 75) * 100\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n2 divided by 75 is approximately 0.02666...\n\nMultiply that by 100 to get a percentage, so 0.02666... * 100 = 2.666...\n\nSo, that would be approximately 2.66%.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 2.66% seems to match this calculation.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if I'm understanding the accuracy specification correctly. It says \"2% of full scale reading.\" Is the full scale reading 100 volts, yes? So, the error is 2% of 100 volts, which is 2 volts, as calculated.\n\nNow, to find the limiting error in percentage, I need to see how much error there could be relative to the measured value. Since the measurement is 75 volts, and the possible error is 2 volts, the relative error is indeed about 2.66%.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe I should consider if the error is proportional to the reading or to the full scale.\n\nThe problem states it's 2% of full scale, not 2% of the reading. So, regardless of the reading, the error is based on the full scale value.\n\nTherefore, the error is fixed at 2 volts, and the relative error will change depending on the reading, as shown in the calculation.\n\nSo, for a reading of 75 volts, the relative error is approximately 2.66%.\n\nLooking at the options again, B. 2.66% seems correct.\n\nWait, but option A is 3.33%. Is there any way it could be that?\n\nLet me see. If I mistakenly used the full scale reading in the denominator, like 2/100 *100, that would give 2%, but that's not matching any option directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm confusing the formula for relative error.\n\nLet me recall: Relative error is generally calculated as (Absolute error / True value) * 100%.\n\nBut in this case, the true value is unknown; we only have the measured value.\n\nHowever, given the guaranteed accuracy, we can infer the possible range of true values based on the measurement.\n\nSo, my initial approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people talk about error percentages in terms of the measurement instrument's precision.\n\nBut in this specific case, it's clearly stated as 2% of full scale.\n\nSo, sticking to that, the absolute error is 2 volts, and for a reading of 75 volts, the relative error is indeed (2/75)*100 \u2248 2.66%.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. 2.66%.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could influence this.\n\nIs the error symmetric? That is, if the voltmeter reads 75 volts, could the actual voltage be 75 + 2 = 77 volts or 75 - 2 = 73 volts?\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAnd the relative error would be the same in percentage terms, whether the error is positive or negative.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 2.66\\%} \\]"
