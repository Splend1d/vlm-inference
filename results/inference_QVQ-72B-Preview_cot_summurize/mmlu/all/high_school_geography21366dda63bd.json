The options are A. Italy, B. Russia, C. Japan, D. Brazil.\"\n\nHmm, interesting. I need to think about this. I'm not an expert on language policies in every country, but I do remember hearing about some countries being pretty strict about protecting their languages.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Italy. I know that Italian is a beautiful language with a rich history, and it's still widely spoken not just in Italy but in other parts of the world too. But is Italy particularly active in preserving the purity of its language? I'm not so sure. I know that in everyday life, Italian is full of regional dialects, and the standard language is more used in formal settings. Maybe there are efforts to maintain the standard language, but I don't recall any specific movements against borrowing words from English or other languages.\n\nNext, Russia. Russian is another major language with a strong cultural identity. I've heard that in Russia, there's been some pushback against the influence of English, especially in media and advertising. In fact, I think there are laws in Russia that require the use of Russian in certain contexts or that restrict the use of foreign words without providing a Russian translation. So, maybe Russia is taking steps to preserve its language's purity.\n\nThen, Japan. Japanese is known for incorporating a lot of loanwords from English, especially in technology and fashion. Words like \"computer\" (kompyuta), \"cool\" (kuru), and \"shock\" (shokku) are commonly used. But does Japan try to prevent this kind of linguistic borrowing? I think the Japanese Language Society and other organizations might promote the use of Japanese terms over foreign ones, but I'm not sure how enforced these efforts are. It seems like the language is continually evolving to include more English words, so maybe preservation efforts aren't as strong as in other countries.\n\nLastly, Brazil. Brazilian Portuguese is the main language spoken in Brazil, and it's the largest Portuguese-speaking country in the world. I know that there's a Brazilian Academy of Letters that oversees the language, similar to the French Academy for French. They might work on standardizing the language and suggesting Portuguese equivalents for foreign words. However, English influences are still prevalent in Brazilian Portuguese, especially in technology and business terms. So, while there might be efforts to preserve the language, I'm not sure how strictly they're enforced.\n\nComparing all these, Russia seems to have more stringent policies regarding the use of the Russian language, particularly in official contexts and media. The Russian Federation has laws that mandate the use of Russian in government and official documents, and there are regulations concerning the use of foreign words in advertising and public signage.\n\nIn Italy, while there might be some academic efforts to maintain the purity of Italian, in practice, the language is quite flexible and absorbs many anglicisms, especially in informal settings and among younger generations.\n\nIn Japan, although there are some efforts to promote Japanese terms, the language continues to borrow extensively from English, and this seems to be accepted as part of its evolution.\n\nIn Brazil, Brazilian Portuguese is influenced by English, particularly in urban areas and among younger people, despite the existence of official language guardians.\n\nTherefore, based on my knowledge, I would say that Russia is the country among the options that is most actively trying to preserve the purity of its native language from contamination by English or other languages.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
