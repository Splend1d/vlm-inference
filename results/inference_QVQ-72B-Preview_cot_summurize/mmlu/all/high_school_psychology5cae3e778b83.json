                    "text": "Let's see here. Elise is driving to school and hears about a concert ticket giveaway on the radio. She needs to be the seventh caller to win, so she pulls over to call in and repeats the phone number to herself several times. The question is asking what type of memory process she's using to remember the phone number. The options are iconic memory, elaborative rehearsal, chunking, and maintenance rehearsal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nIconic memory is a type of sensory memory that retains visual images for a very short time, usually just a fraction of a second. It's like a mental photograph that fades quickly. I don't think this is the one Elise is using because she's repeating a phone number, which sounds more auditory than visual.\n\nElaborative rehearsal involves thinking deeply about information and connecting it to existing knowledge to enhance memory. For example, if you remember a phone number by associating each digit with a fact or image. But in this scenario, Elise is just repeating the number to herself several times, not really connecting it to anything else. So, this might not be the best fit.\n\nChunking is a strategy where you group pieces of information together to make them easier to remember. For instance, breaking up a phone number into smaller, manageable parts, like area code, prefix, and last four digits. Elise might be using this technique, but the description doesn't specify that she's grouping the numbers in any particular way; she's just repeating the whole number several times.\n\nMaintenance rehearsal is when you repeat information over and over in your mind to keep it in your short-term memory. This is often just rote repetition without adding any meaning or context to the information. This seems pretty close to what Elise is doing\u2014repeating the phone number to herself several times to remember it.\n\nLet me think about this again. Elise is repeating the phone number to herself several times while pulling over. This sounds like she's engaging in rote memorization, which is characteristic of maintenance rehearsal. Iconic memory is more about visual retention, elaborative rehearsal involves deeper processing, and chunking involves grouping information, none of which seem to match the description as closely as maintenance rehearsal.\n\nMaybe I should consider if there's any other information in the scenario that could point towards another answer. The fact that she's pulling over suggests that she needs to focus on remembering the number temporarily, just long enough to make the call. Maintenance rehearsal is a common way to keep information in mind for a short period.\n\nI should also consider the context of the situation. She's trying to be the seventh caller to win tickets, so there's a sense of urgency. She might not have time to engage in more complex memory strategies like elaborative rehearsal or chunking; instead, quickly repeating the number is a straightforward way to keep it in her mind.\n\nAnother point to consider is that maintenance rehearsal is often used for its efficiency in keeping information active in short-term memory without the need for deep processing. Since Elise is likely under time pressure, this would be the most practical approach.\n\nI think I've covered all the options, and based on the description, maintenance rehearsal seems to be the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
