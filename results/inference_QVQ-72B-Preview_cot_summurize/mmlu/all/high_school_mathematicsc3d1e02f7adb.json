                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"The longest side of a triangle is 10. Which of the following could NOT be the lengths of the other two sides? A. 4,7 B. 5,5 C. 3,9 D. 9,8\"\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall the triangle inequality theorem. I think it says that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. So, if the longest side is 10, then for any other two sides, say a and b, the sum a + b needs to be greater than 10. Also, the sum of a and 10 should be greater than b, and the sum of b and 10 should be greater than a. But maybe there's a quicker way to check which combination doesn't fit.\n\nLet me list out the options again:\n\nA. 4,7\n\nB. 5,5\n\nC. 3,9\n\nD. 9,8\n\nAnd the longest side is 10.\n\nI need to check which of these sets do not form a valid triangle with the longest side being 10.\n\nSo, for each option, I'll check if the sum of the two sides is greater than 10, and also if each of the two sides is less than the sum of the other two sides.\n\nStarting with option A: 4 and 7.\n\nSum = 4 + 7 = 11, which is greater than 10.\n\nAlso, 4 < 7 + 10 = 17, and 7 < 4 + 10 = 14.\n\nSo, this should be a valid set.\n\nOption B: 5 and 5.\n\nSum = 5 + 5 = 10, which is not greater than 10. Wait, but I think the triangle inequality requires the sum to be strictly greater than the third side. So, if sum is equal to the third side, does that still form a triangle?\n\nWell, in Euclidean geometry, if two sides are equal, it would essentially collapse into a straight line, not forming a triangle. So, 5 + 5 = 10 means that it wouldn't form a valid triangle. So, this could be the answer. But let me check the others to be sure.\n\nOption C: 3 and 9.\n\nSum = 3 + 9 = 12, which is greater than 10.\n\nAlso, 3 < 9 + 10 = 19, and 9 < 3 + 10 = 13.\n\nSo, this should be valid.\n\nOption D: 9 and 8.\n\nSum = 9 + 8 = 17, which is greater than 10.\n\nAlso, 9 < 8 + 10 = 18, and 8 < 9 + 10 = 19.\n\nThis also seems valid.\n\nSo, based on this, option B: 5,5 seems to be the invalid set because the sum of the two sides equals the longest side, which wouldn't form a valid triangle.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the triangle inequality in terms of all three sides: a, b, and c, where c is the longest side, so c = 10.\n\nThe triangle inequalities are:\n\n1. a + b > c\n\n2. a + c > b\n\n3. b + c > a\n\nBut since c is the largest side, a and b are both less than c, so a < 10 and b < 10.\n\nSo, perhaps I can simplify this by just checking a + b > c.\n\nIf a + b > 10, then the other two inequalities should hold automatically because a and b are positive.\n\nSo, maybe I can just check if a + b > 10 for each option.\n\nOption A: 4 + 7 = 11 > 10\n\nOption B: 5 + 5 = 10, which is not greater than 10; it's equal.\n\nOption C: 3 + 9 = 12 > 10\n\nOption D: 9 + 8 = 17 > 10\n\nSo, according to this, option B is invalid because a + b is not greater than 10; it's equal to 10, which, as I thought earlier, would not form a valid triangle.\n\nBut wait, is there a possibility that even if a + b = c, it could still form a triangle? Like a degenerate triangle, but typically, in standard triangle definitions, sides must be strictly less than the sum of the others.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Maybe I can consider the law of cosines or something, but that seems overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the perimeter or other properties, but that doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other constraint I'm missing. The problem states that the longest side is 10, so the other two sides must be less than 10, and their sum must be greater than 10, as per the triangle inequality.\n\nOption B: 5 and 5, sum is 10, which is not greater than 10, so it doesn't satisfy the triangle inequality.\n\nTherefore, option B could not be the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nTo confirm, let's consider what would happen if we tried to form a triangle with sides 5, 5, and 10. The first inequality: 5 + 5 > 10? No, 10 is not greater than 10. So, it fails this condition.\n\nIn the other options:\n\nA: 4 + 7 > 10 \u2192 11 > 10 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nC: 3 + 9 > 10 \u2192 12 > 10 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nD: 9 + 8 > 10 \u2192 17 > 10 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHence, only option B does not satisfy the triangle inequality.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 5,5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
