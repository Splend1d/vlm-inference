                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Sarah's swimming times. She's had five attempts so far, and her times in seconds for swimming 50 meters are 86, 94, 97, 88, and 96. After her sixth attempt, her median time drops down to 92 seconds. I need to figure out what her time was for that sixth attempt.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what a median is. The median is the middle value when numbers are ordered from least to greatest. Since she has had five attempts already and the sixth one makes it six attempts in total, the median would be the average of the third and fourth values in an ordered list of six numbers.\n\nWait, actually, for an even number of observations, the median is indeed the average of the two middle numbers. So, with six attempts, the median would be the average of the third and fourth values when ordered.\n\nBut the problem says that the median time after the sixth attempt is 92 seconds. So, if the median is 92, that means the average of the third and fourth times in the ordered list is 92.\n\nLet me first order the first five times:\n\n86, 88, 94, 96, 97.\n\nSo, ordered from least to greatest, they are 86, 88, 94, 96, 97.\n\nNow, let's denote the sixth time as X.\n\nAfter including X, the ordered list will have six values. Let's assume X is inserted in its correct position in the ordered list.\n\nDepending on the value of X, it could be less than 86, between 86 and 88, between 88 and 94, between 94 and 96, between 96 and 97, or greater than 97.\n\nBut I need to find X such that the median of the six times is 92.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, for six values, the median is the average of the third and fourth values.\n\nSo, I need the average of the third and fourth values in the ordered list to be 92.\n\nLet's consider the possible positions of X in the ordered list.\n\nCase 1: X is less than 86.\n\nThen the ordered list would be X, 86, 88, 94, 96, 97.\n\nHere, the third value is 88 and the fourth is 94.\n\nThe average would be (88 + 94)/2 = 91, which is not 92.\n\nSo, this can't be the case.\n\nCase 2: X is between 86 and 88.\n\nThen the ordered list would be 86, X, 88, 94, 96, 97.\n\nThe third value is 88 and the fourth is 94.\n\nAgain, the average is 91, not 92.\n\nNot this case either.\n\nCase 3: X is between 88 and 94.\n\nThen the ordered list would be 86, 88, X, 94, 96, 97.\n\nThe third value is X and the fourth is 94.\n\nSo, the average should be (X + 94)/2 = 92.\n\nSolving for X: X + 94 = 184 => X = 184 - 94 => X = 90.\n\nIs X = 90 a possible time? Let's see.\n\n90 is between 88 and 94, so this fits.\n\nSo, X = 90 could be the answer.\n\nBut let's check the other cases to make sure.\n\nCase 4: X is between 94 and 96.\n\nOrdered list: 86, 88, 94, X, 96, 97.\n\nThird value is 94, fourth is X.\n\nAverage: (94 + X)/2 = 92.\n\nSo, 94 + X = 184 => X = 184 - 94 => X = 90.\n\nBut X is supposed to be between 94 and 96, but X = 90 is less than 94.\n\nThis contradicts the assumption that X is between 94 and 96.\n\nTherefore, this case doesn't provide a valid solution.\n\nCase 5: X is between 96 and 97.\n\nOrdered list: 86, 88, 94, 96, X, 97.\n\nThird value is 94, fourth is 96.\n\nAverage: (94 + 96)/2 = 95, which is not 92.\n\nNot this case.\n\nCase 6: X is greater than 97.\n\nOrdered list: 86, 88, 94, 96, 97, X.\n\nThird value is 94, fourth is 96.\n\nAverage: (94 + 96)/2 = 95, not 92.\n\nNot this case either.\n\nSo, the only valid case is when X is between 88 and 94, specifically X = 90.\n\nLet me just double-check if X = 90, does the median become 92?\n\nOrdered list: 86, 88, 90, 94, 96, 97.\n\nThird value is 90, fourth is 94.\n\nAverage: (90 + 94)/2 = 92.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nAlso, checking if X = 90 is within the range of swimming times.\n\n86 to 97 seconds seem reasonable for swimming 50 meters, so 90 seconds is plausible.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
