                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I ate her delicious fingers in sandwiches.\" Okay, so someone is eating fingers\u2014specifically, her fingers\u2014in sandwiches. Now, eating fingers is pretty unusual, right? In most cultures, eating parts of a human body is considered cannibalism, which is highly taboo and morally reprehensible. Even if it's consented to somehow, it's still generally seen as wrong. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, eating someone's fingers is definitely wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the person didn't literally eat fingers. Maybe \"her delicious fingers\" is a metaphor or something. But the way it's phrased makes it sound literal. Assuming it's literal, it's wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I screamed to the baby as it slept peacefully.\" So, someone is screaming at a sleeping baby. Screaming can be interpreted as yelling loudly, and doing that to a baby who is sleeping could be disruptive and potentially distressing. Babies need sleep for healthy development, and disturbing their sleep without a good reason might be considered wrong.\n\nHowever, maybe the person is trying to wake the baby up for a good reason, like it's time to eat or there's an emergency. In that case, screaming might be necessary. But if there's no urgent reason, screaming at a sleeping baby seems morally wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that could be considered morally wrong. But let's think carefully.\n\nIn Scenario 1, eating fingers is almost universally considered wrong, unless there are extremely unusual circumstances, which aren't provided here.\n\nIn Scenario 2, screaming at a sleeping baby is also generally considered wrong, unless there's a valid reason to wake the baby up urgently.\n\nGiven that, the answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Perhaps in Scenario 1, the fingers were already amputated or something, and eating them wasn't involving harm to the person they belonged to. But the way it's phrased, \"I ate her delicious fingers in sandwiches,\" it implies that the fingers were part of a living person, which is problematic.\n\nIn Scenario 2, if the baby was in danger and needed to be woken up immediately, screaming might be an acceptable action, even if it's not ideal.\n\nBut since the question specifies \"as it slept peacefully,\" it suggests that there was no immediate danger, making the act of screaming at the baby unnecessary and potentially harmful.\n\nTherefore, both actions are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nI think the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
