                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem here: Samantha has 342 baseball cards, and Perry has 184 baseball cards. I need to find out how many more baseball cards Samantha has than Perry. Okay, so basically, I need to subtract Perry's cards from Samantha's cards, right?\n\nSo, 342 minus 184. Hmm, let me think about how to do this subtraction step by step. Maybe I can break it down to make it easier.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the hundreds place. Samantha has 3 hundred, and Perry has 1 hundred. So, 300 minus 100 is 200. That seems straightforward.\n\nNext, I'll look at the tens place. Samantha has 4 tens, and Perry has 8 tens. Wait, but Perry has 184, which is 1 hundred, 8 tens, and 4 ones. So, actually, Perry has 8 tens, which is 80, and Samantha has 4 tens, which is 40. So, if I subtract Perry's 80 from Samantha's 40, that doesn't make sense because 40 is less than 80. Hmm, maybe I need to regroup or borrow from the hundreds place.\n\nLet me try regrouping. In Samantha's number, 342, the 3 is in the hundreds place, the 4 is in the tens place, and the 2 is in the ones place. If I need to borrow from the hundreds place to make the subtraction easier, I can think of 342 as 3 hundreds, 4 tens, and 2 ones.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use the standard subtraction method. Let's write it down:\n\n```\n\n  3 4 2\n\n- 1 8 4\n\n```\n\nStarting from the ones place:\n\n2 minus 4. Oh, 2 is less than 4, so I need to borrow from the tens place. The tens place has a 4, which is really 4 tens. So, if I borrow one ten from the tens place, that leaves 3 tens in the tens place. The borrowed ten becomes 10 ones, which I add to the 2 ones, making it 12 ones.\n\nNow, the ones place: 12 minus 4 equals 8 ones.\n\nMoving to the tens place: 3 tens minus 8 tens. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh, no, I borrowed from the tens place, so now it's 3 tens. So, 3 tens minus 8 tens. But 3 is less than 8, so I need to borrow again.\n\nThis time, I'll borrow from the hundreds place. The hundreds place has a 3, so I borrow one hundred, which is 100, and add it to the tens place. So, the hundreds place becomes 2 hundreds, and the tens place becomes 13 tens.\n\nNow, subtract in the tens place: 13 tens minus 8 tens equals 5 tens.\n\nFinally, in the hundreds place: 2 hundreds minus 1 hundred equals 1 hundred.\n\nSo, putting it together: 1 hundred, 5 tens, and 8 ones, which is 158.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option A is 158. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I can add up to Perry's number from Samantha's number.\n\nStarting from 184, I want to get to 342.\n\nFirst, add 100 to 184 to make it 284.\n\nThen, add another 60 to make it 344.\n\nWait, but that's 284 plus 60 is 344, which is 2 more than 342. So, I've overshot by 2.\n\nSo, I need to subtract 2 from 344 to get to 342.\n\nSo, total, I added 100 + 60 - 2 = 158.\n\nYes, that matches my previous answer of 158.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the standard subtraction algorithm again, but more carefully.\n\nSubtract 184 from 342:\n\n342\n\n-184\n\n------\n\n 158\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nLet me check another way. Maybe using a number line.\n\nPlot 342 on a number line. Then, subtract 184 by counting back 184 units from 342.\n\nBut that seems time-consuming. Maybe not the best way for this problem.\n\nAnother option: since subtraction is the same as adding the negative, so 342 + (-184) = 158.\n\nAgain, that gives me 158.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use complementary addition. Like, find how much to add to 184 to get to 342.\n\nStart at 184.\n\nAdd 100 to make it 284.\n\nThen, add 60 to make it 344.\n\nSubtract 2 to make it 342.\n\nSo, total added: 100 + 60 - 2 = 158.\n\nAgain, confirming that the difference is 158.\n\nI think I've approached this in multiple ways and consistently get 158 as the answer. So, I'm confident that's correct.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 158\n\nB. 168\n\nC. 258\n\nD. 268\n\nSo, the correct choice is A. 158.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 158} \\]"
