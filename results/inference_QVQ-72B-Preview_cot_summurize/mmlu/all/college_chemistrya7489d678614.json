                    "text": "So I have this question about oxidation-reduction reactions, and I need to figure out which one is most likely to occur based on oxidation-reduction potential. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I remember that in a redox reaction, the substance with a higher reduction potential can be reduced by the substance with a lower reduction potential.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what oxidation and reduction are. Oxidation is when a substance loses electrons, and reduction is when a substance gains electrons. In a redox reaction, these processes happen together: one substance is oxidized while another is reduced.\n\nThe question mentions \"oxidation-reduction potential,\" which I think refers to the standard reduction potential (E\u00b0), a measure of how strongly a substance tends to gain electrons and be reduced. Substances with higher E\u00b0 values are stronger oxidizing agents and can oxidize substances with lower E\u00b0 values.\n\nSo, to determine which reaction is most likely to occur, I should look for a reaction where the substance being reduced has a higher standard reduction potential than the substance being oxidized.\n\nLet's list out the standard reduction potentials for the metals involved. I'll need to find a table or recall the approximate values.\n\nStarting with aluminum (Al):\n\nAl\u00b3\u207a + 3e\u207b \u2192 Al(s) E\u00b0 \u2248 -1.66 V\n\nNext, sodium (Na):\n\nNa\u207a + e\u207b \u2192 Na(s) E\u00b0 = -2.71 V\n\nZinc (Zn):\n\nZn\u00b2\u207a + 2e\u207b \u2192 Zn(s) E\u00b0 = -0.76 V\n\nSilver (Ag):\n\nAg\u207a + e\u207b \u2192 Ag(s) E\u00b0 = +0.80 V\n\nLead (Pb):\n\nPb\u00b2\u207a + 2e\u207b \u2192 Pb(s) E\u00b0 = -0.13 V\n\nCalcium (Ca):\n\nCa\u00b2\u207a + 2e\u207b \u2192 Ca(s) E\u00b0 = -2.87 V\n\nLithium (Li):\n\nLi\u207a + e\u207b \u2192 Li(s) E\u00b0 = -3.04 V\n\nNow, let's look at each reaction option:\n\nA. Al(s) + 3 NaNO\u2083(aq) \u2192 3 Na(s) + Al(NO\u2083)\u2083(aq)\n\nHere, aluminum is being oxidized to Al\u00b3\u207a, and sodium is being reduced to Na(s). The E\u00b0 for Al is -1.66 V, and for Na is -2.71 V. Since Na has a more negative E\u00b0 than Al, it means Al is less likely to reduce Na\u207a to Na(s). In other words, Na\u207a has a higher tendency to stay oxidized than Al\u00b3\u207a does. So, this reaction may not proceed as written.\n\nB. Zn(s) + 2 Ag(NO\u2083)(aq) \u2192 2 Ag(s) + Zn(NO\u2083)\u2082(aq)\n\nHere, zinc is being oxidized to Zn\u00b2\u207a, and silver is being reduced to Ag(s). The E\u00b0 for Zn is -0.76 V, and for Ag is +0.80 V. Since Ag has a higher E\u00b0 than Zn, it means Ag\u207a is more likely to be reduced than Zn is to be oxidized. Therefore, this reaction should proceed as written.\n\nC. Pb(s) + Ca(NO\u2083)\u2082(aq) \u2192 Ca(s) + Pb(NO\u2083)\u2082(aq)\n\nHere, lead is being oxidized to Pb\u00b2\u207a, and calcium is being reduced to Ca(s). The E\u00b0 for Pb is -0.13 V, and for Ca is -2.87 V. Since Ca has a more negative E\u00b0 than Pb, it's unlikely that Pb will reduce Ca\u00b2\u207a to Ca(s). So, this reaction is not expected to occur as written.\n\nD. Pb(s) + 2 LiNO\u2083(aq) \u2192 2 Li(s) + Pb(NO\u2083)\u2082(aq)\n\nHere, lead is being oxidized to Pb\u00b2\u207a, and lithium is being reduced to Li(s). The E\u00b0 for Pb is -0.13 V, and for Li is -3.04 V. Similar to option C, Li has a more negative E\u00b0 than Pb, so Pb is not likely to reduce Li\u207a to Li(s). This reaction is also not expected to occur as written.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only reaction that is likely to occur is option B: Zn(s) + 2 Ag(NO\u2083)(aq) \u2192 2 Ag(s) + Zn(NO\u2083)\u2082(aq), because the reduction potential of silver is higher than that of zinc.\n\nI should also consider if there are any exceptions or special conditions that might affect these reactions, but under standard conditions, this should hold true.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the general principle: for a redox reaction to occur spontaneously, the reduction potential of the substance being reduced should be greater than the oxidation potential of the substance being oxidized. In other words, E\u00b0(cathode) > E\u00b0(anode).\n\nIn option B, E\u00b0(Ag\u207a/Ag) = +0.80 V and E\u00b0(Zn\u00b2\u207a/Zn) = -0.76 V. So, E\u00b0(cell) = +0.80 V - (-0.76 V) = +1.56 V, which is positive, indicating a spontaneous reaction under standard conditions.\n\nSimilarly, for option A: E\u00b0(Na\u207a/Na) = -2.71 V and E\u00b0(Al\u00b3\u207a/Al) = -1.66 V. E\u00b0(cell) = -1.66 V - (-2.71 V) = +1.05 V, which is positive, but considering the reactivities, aluminum may not reduce sodium ions effectively.\n\nHowever, according to the standard potentials, it should proceed, but in practice, sodium is highly reactive and difficult to reduce from its ions using another metal like aluminum.\n\nTherefore, option B seems the most straightforward and feasible reaction based on standard reduction potentials.\n\nSo, the answer is B. Zn(s) + 2 Ag(NO\u2083)(aq) \u2192 2 Ag(s) + Zn(NO\u2083)\u2082(aq)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
