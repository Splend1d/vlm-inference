                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question about appellate courts. Let's see what it's asking. The options are:\n\nA. Appellate judges never use the stare decisis principle.\n\nB. Appellate trials are usually jury trials.\n\nC. Appellate judges usually decide the facts of a case.\n\nD. Appellate judges review decisions of lower courts.\n\nHmm, I need to recall what appellate courts do. I think appellate courts are like the higher courts that look over the decisions made by lower courts. So, they don't usually conduct new trials with juries; they mainly check if the lower court made any mistakes in applying the law.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that appellate judges never use the stare decisis principle. Stare decisis is the principle of precedent, right? Like, following previous decisions to ensure consistency in the law. I don't think appellate judges ignore precedent. In fact, they often rely on it to make their decisions. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption B says that appellate trials are usually jury trials. I don't think that's the case. Appellate courts primarily review the record from the lower court and decide whether there were errors in the application of law or procedure. They don't typically have juries for that process. So, this probably isn't true.\n\nOption C says that appellate judges usually decide the facts of a case. I remember that appellate courts generally accept the facts as they were found by the lower court, unless there's a clear error. Their main focus is on questions of law, not facts. So, they don't usually re-decide the facts. That means this option is likely false.\n\nOption D says that appellate judges review decisions of lower courts. This seems accurate. That's their main function\u2014to review the decisions made by trial courts and ensure that the law was applied correctly.\n\nLet me double-check. Appellate courts are part of the judicial system that handles appeals from decisions of trial courts. They don't conduct new trials or have juries; instead, they examine the transcripts and evidence from the lower court to see if there were any legal mistakes.\n\nSo, based on that, option D seems to be the correct statement about appellate courts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
