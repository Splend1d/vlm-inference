                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question about pocket mice in New Mexico. There are dark-colored mice living on black lava formations and light-colored mice living in the sandy desert. And I need to figure out which statement is correct about this scenario.\n\nOption A says that the two varieties of mice descended from a recent common ancestor. Hmm, that makes sense because they're probably related, right? But I need to think about what \"recent\" means in evolutionary terms. It could be a few thousand years or something like that.\n\nOption B says that the mouse population was originally one population that diverged into two species because of mutations. So, this sounds like speciation, where one species splits into two due to genetic differences. But did that happen here? Are these still the same species, or have they become different species?\n\nOption C says that selection favors some phenotypes over others. That seems generally true. Natural selection is all about differential reproduction based on traits, right? So, in this case, maybe dark color helps mice blend in on the lava fields and light color helps in the sandy desert, so those traits are favored.\n\nOption D says that originally all the mice were dark colored, and as the lava decomposed into sand, the color of some mice changed because that color was favored in that environment. So, this suggests that the environment changed first, and then the mice adapted to it.\n\nI need to think about which one is correct. Let's consider the scenario.\n\nWe have two different habitats: black lava formations and light-colored sandy desert. Each habitat has mice that match the color of their environment\u2014dark on lava and light on sand. This suggests that there's some sort of adaptation going on, probably related to camouflage from predators.\n\nNow, considering that they're both pocket mice and inhabit such closely located but different environments, it's likely that they share a common ancestry. So, option A seems plausible.\n\nBut, option B suggests speciation into two different species. Do these mice consider each other as different species? I don't know. Maybe they can still interbreed, or maybe they've become reproductively isolated. Without that information, it's hard to say.\n\nOption C is quite general and is probably true in most natural settings. Selection does favor certain traits over others based on the environment.\n\nOption D proposes that the environment changed first, and then the mice adapted to it. That seems possible. Maybe the lava cooled and formed these black formations, and over time, some mice living there had darker fur that helped them hide from predators, so they had better survival and reproduction rates.\n\nBut, I need to think about whether this is the best answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe both options A and D could be correct in different ways. Maybe the mice had a common ancestor, and then as the environment changed with the lava flows, some mice moved to the lava fields and others stayed in the desert. Over time, natural selection favored different colorations in each environment.\n\nBut the question is asking for the correct statement about this scenario, and I need to choose one option.\n\nLet me see if there's any information missing that could help me decide.\n\nThe question mentions that dark-colored mice inhabit the lava formations and light-colored ones inhabit the desert. It doesn't specify whether these are different species or just different color morphs of the same species.\n\nIf they're different species, then option B might be more accurate, suggesting speciation.\n\nIf they're still the same species, then option C or D could be applicable, depending on the specifics.\n\nBut option A says they descended from a recent common ancestor, which is likely true regardless of whether they're different species or not.\n\nWait, but option A specifies \"a recent common ancestor,\" implying that the split happened not too long ago.\n\nI need to think about the timescales involved. In evolutionary terms, \"recent\" could still be tens of thousands or even millions of years ago.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the concept of adaptive radiation. When a species colonizes a new environment, different populations can adapt to different niches, leading to divergent evolution.\n\nIn this case, if a population of mice originally lived in the area and then some started living on the lava fields while others stayed in the desert, natural selection would favor different traits in each environment.\n\nSo, option C is generally true, but it's quite broad.\n\nOption D provides a specific scenario where the environment changed first, and then the mice adapted.\n\nOption A suggests a recent common ancestry, which is likely given their close proximity and similar species.\n\nOption B suggests speciation due to mutations.\n\nI think the key here is whether these are still the same species or different ones.\n\nIf they can still interbreed and produce fertile offspring, then they're the same species, and option B might not be accurate.\n\nIf they've become reproductively isolated and are considered different species, then option B could be accurate.\n\nBut without specific information about their reproductive compatibility, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the color difference is just a phenotypic variation due to the environment, and they're still the same species.\n\nBut that seems unlikely; usually, such traits are genetic adaptations.\n\nPerhaps I should consider an example. Take the peppered moths in England. Before industrialization, most moths were light-colored, blending in with lichen-covered trees. With industrial pollution, the trees became darkened, and dark-colored moths had an advantage because they were better camouflaged from predators.\n\nIn that case, it was natural selection favoring a different phenotype in response to environmental change, but it was still the same species.\n\nSimilarly, in the mice scenario, if the dark and light mice can still interbreed, then they're the same species, and option B wouldn't be correct.\n\nOption D seems plausible because it describes a scenario where the environment changed (lava cooling into sand), and then the mice adapted to that environment.\n\nBut option A also seems plausible because it's likely that both types of mice share a recent common ancestor.\n\nWait, maybe option A is more about the ancestry and option D is about the adaptation process.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer combines both: they share a recent common ancestor, and then adapted to different environments through natural selection.\n\nBut I have to choose one statement, and both A and D seem relevant.\n\nLet me see if I can find any additional context or information that might help.\n\nThe question mentions \"pocket mice,\" which are a group of rodents in the family Heteromyidae. There are multiple species of pocket mice, some of which may inhabit lava flows or desert environments.\n\nPerhaps in reality, there are different species of pocket mice adapted to different habitats in New Mexico.\n\nIf that's the case, then option B might be correct, suggesting speciation.\n\nBut I don't have specific information about the species involved, so I have to base my answer on the scenario provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the same species with different color morphs in different environments.\n\nIn that case, option C would be correct, as selection is favoring different phenotypes in different environments.\n\nOption D also makes sense, as the environment changed with the lava flows, and the mice adapted to those changes.\n\nBut option A is also logical, as it's likely that both types of mice share a recent common ancestor.\n\nHmm.\n\nI think the best answer is option C: selection favors some phenotypes over others.\n\nThis is because, regardless of whether speciation has occurred or not, the scenario describes a situation where mice in different environments have different colorations that help them blend in, which is a direct result of natural selection favoring those traits.\n\nOptions A and D are also plausible, but option C is the most straightforward and generally applicable to the scenario described.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
