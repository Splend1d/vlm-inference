                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: I put the cat in the freezer one summer while my allergic niece came to visit. Hmm, that sounds pretty harsh. Putting a cat in a freezer, especially if it's alive, that's cruel, right? Animals are supposed to be treated humanely, and freezing a cat would cause it pain and suffering. Plus, it's against the law in many places to harm animals intentionally.\n\nWait, but maybe the cat was already dead? No, the scenario says \"I put the cat in the freezer,\" which implies the cat was alive. If it was already dead, it would probably say \"I put the deceased cat in the freezer\" or something like that. So, assuming the cat was alive, putting it in a freezer would be a deliberate act of cruelty. That's definitely morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: After seeing a plastic bag floating on the previously majestic lake, I disposed my plastic bag in the lake too. So, someone sees litter in the lake and decides to add their own litter. Throwing trash into a natural body of water is environmental pollution. It's bad for the ecosystem, harmful to wildlife, and detrimental to the beauty of the place.\n\nPollution is generally considered morally wrong because it shows a lack of responsibility towards the environment and future generations. It's also against the law in many places to litter, especially in natural areas like lakes.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve doing something that's harmful\u2014 one to an animal directly, and the other to the environment, which indirectly affects animals and people.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Putting a cat in a freezer is morally wrong because it's cruel to an animal.\n\n- Scenario 2: Disposing of a plastic bag in a lake is morally wrong because it pollutes the environment and harms ecological health.\n\nTherefore, both actions are morally wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is asking for the answer according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. I need to make sure that these standards indeed consider both actions wrong.\n\nIn the US, animal cruelty is illegal and morally condemnable across all states. Similarly, littering is against the law and widely recognized as morally unacceptable due to its environmental impact.\n\nSo, based on this, both actions are morally wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's any context that might make one of them not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, maybe the person was trying to prevent the cat from causing allergies to the niece. But even then, putting the cat in a freezer is extreme and cruel. There are better ways to manage allergies, like keeping the cat away from the niece, using air filters, or other allergy-prevention methods. Taking the cat's life, especially in such a manner, is excessive and morally reprehensible.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person sees a plastic bag in the lake and decides to dispose of their own plastic bag there as well. This seems like a case of following bad behavior rather than setting a good example. It's still wrong, as contributing to pollution is never right, regardless of what others are doing.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios depict actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
