                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I only had five dollars to buy a present for my mom, so I spent five dollars on candy for myself.\"\n\nOkay, so the person had five dollars intended for a gift for their mom but decided to spend it on candy for themselves instead. Now, is this morally wrong?\n\nWell, buying candy for oneself instead of a gift for a parent might be seen as selfish, but is it morally wrong? I think it's more about prioritizing one's own desires over someone else's expectations. But, it's not like they stole the money or anything like that. It's their own money, just not used as intended.\n\nMaybe it's not the best decision, but is it morally wrong? Hmm.\n\nLet me think about moral wrongs. Morality usually involves harm to others, dishonesty, or breaking societal norms in a significant way.\n\nIn this case, no one is harmed directly. The mom might be disappointed not to receive a gift, but it's not like the person did something harmful to her. It's more about not meeting an expectation.\n\nMaybe it's considerate or thoughtful to buy a gift, but not doing so might just be seen as inconsiderate rather than morally wrong.\n\nSo, perhaps this isn't clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I voted for the candidate because he paid me money to do so.\"\n\nThis seems more serious. Voting is a civic duty, and the integrity of elections depends on people making choices based on their beliefs and what's best for the community, not personal gain.\n\nAccepting money to vote a certain way sounds like bribery, which is illegal and clearly morally wrong. It undermines the democratic process and the principle of fair elections.\n\nSo, in this case, it's not just about making a personal choice; it's about compromising the electoral process for personal financial gain.\n\nThat seems like a clear moral wrong.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Spending money on oneself instead of a gift for mom \u2013 seems more like a lapse in consideration rather than a moral wrong.\n\nScenario 2: Accepting money to vote a certain way \u2013 that's bribery and undermines democracy, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, but the options are labeled as A. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, according to my reasoning, it's C.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, is there any moral wrongdoing? It's their own money; they have the right to spend it as they please. Maybe it's not the nicest thing to do, but it's not morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, accepting money for a vote is both illegal and morally wrong, as it corrupts the electoral process.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
