                    "text": "Let's tackle this logic problem. So, I have this sentence to symbolize using propositional logic (PL) formulas. The sentence is:\n\n\"Either England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its component statements and identify the logical connectives.\n\nLet's define the propositional variables:\n\n- E: England imports beef.\n\n- F: France subsidizes agriculture.\n\n- C: China promotes human rights.\n\n- S: South Africa supplies diamonds.\n\nNow, the sentence has two main parts connected by \"either...or\":\n\n1. \"England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.\"\n\n2. \"China doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds.\"\n\nI need to symbolize each part and then combine them with the disjunction (or) connective.\n\nStarting with the first part:\n\n\"England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.\"\n\nIn logic, saying that \"P is a sufficient condition for Q\" translates to P \u2283 Q (if P then Q, or P implies Q). So, this part is E \u2283 F.\n\nMoving on to the second part:\n\n\"China doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds.\"\n\nThis part has the form \"P if and only when Q,\" which is a bit tricky. The phrase \"if and only when\" suggests a biconditional relationship. So, it's about the statement ~C \u2261 S, meaning that China does not promote human rights if and only if South Africa supplies diamonds.\n\nNow, combining these two parts with the \"either...or\" connective. In logic, \"either...or\" is typically represented by the disjunction operator \u2228. So, the entire sentence can be symbolized as:\n\n(E \u2283 F) \u2228 (~C \u2261 S)\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (~C \u2283 S)\n\nB. (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (S \u2283 ~C)\n\nC. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 ~(S \u2261 C)\n\nD. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (~C \u2261 S)\n\nMy symbolization matches option D. But let's double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, confirm the first part: E \u2283 F is correct for \"England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.\"\n\nSecond, the second part: \"China doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds.\" This should be ~C \u2261 S, not ~C \u2261 S? Wait, in standard logical notation, the biconditional is often represented by \u2261, but sometimes it's represented by \u2194. To be precise, I should use the symbol that represents biconditional in the given options.\n\nLooking back, option D uses \u2261, which is acceptable for biconditional, though in formal logic, \u2194 is more standard for biconditional. However, since the options use \u2261, I'll assume it's the biconditional operator.\n\nWait a minute, option D has ~C \u2261 S, which matches my symbolization.\n\nBut let's check the other options to ensure they don't also fit.\n\nOption A: (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (~C \u2283 S)\n\nThis has E implies F and ~C implies S. The second part differs from what I think is correct.\n\nOption B: (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (S \u2283 ~C)\n\nHere, F implies E, which is the reverse of the first part, and S implies ~C. Not matching the original sentence.\n\nOption C: (E \u2283 F) \u2228 ~(S \u2261 C)\n\nThis has E implies F and not (S equivalent to C). That's different from the original sentence.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the correct symbolization of the given sentence.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any ambiguity in the sentence that might make another option also correct.\n\nLooking back at the sentence:\n\n\"Either England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds.\"\n\nThe structure is clear: two alternatives connected by \"either...or,\" and each part is properly interpreted as I did.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization is option D: (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (~C \u2261 S)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
