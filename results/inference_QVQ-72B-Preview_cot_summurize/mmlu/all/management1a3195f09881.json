                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Individualism as a guiding moral philosophy was advocated by which economist?\" And the options are John Kenneth Galbraith, John Maynard Keynes, Milton Friedman, and Alfred Marshall. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these economists is known for advocating individualism as a moral philosophy.\n\nFirst off, I should probably understand what individualism means in this context. Individualism is generally the idea that the individual is the primary unit of moral concern, emphasizing personal freedom, autonomy, and responsibility. So, it's about prioritizing the interests and rights of the individual over those of society or the state.\n\nNow, let's think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with John Kenneth Galbraith. I recall that he was a Canadian American economist who was quite critical of unfettered capitalism and emphasized the role of government in regulating the economy. He seemed more inclined towards collective action and government intervention to correct market failures. That doesn't sound very individualistic in the sense of minimizing state intervention in personal affairs.\n\nNext is John Maynard Keynes. He's famous for his theories on macroeconomics and the idea that government should play an active role in managing economic fluctuations, particularly during recessions. Keynesian economics advocate for increased government spending to stimulate demand. While this approach focuses on the collective economy, it doesn't directly align with individualism as a moral philosophy. In fact, it suggests more government involvement, which might contradict the individualist emphasis on minimal state interference.\n\nThen there's Milton Friedman. He's known for his strong advocacy of free markets and minimal government intervention. Friedman believed that individual freedom was best served by allowing market forces to operate with as few restrictions as possible. He was a prominent figure in the Chicago school of economics, which emphasized free enterprise, market freedom, and the importance of individual choice. This sounds quite individualistic. He also argued against many government interventions, believing that they often did more harm than good by restricting individual liberties.\n\nLastly, Alfred Marshall. He was an English economist who made significant contributions to the development of modern economics, particularly in the areas of price theory and the concept of marginal utility. Marshall is often considered a founder of neoclassical economics. While he recognized the importance of individual choices in the economy, his work was more focused on the mechanics of the market and less on individualism as a moral philosophy.\n\nComparing all four, John Kenneth Galbraith and John Maynard Keynes seem to lean more towards collective solutions and government intervention, which may not align as closely with individualism as a guiding moral philosophy. Alfred Marshall was more about the theoretical underpinnings of economics, without particularly emphasizing individualism in a moral sense. On the other hand, Milton Friedman was a staunch advocate of individual freedom and minimal government, which directly corresponds with individualism as a moral philosophy.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, I would say that Milton Friedman is the economist who advocated individualism as a guiding moral philosophy.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any specific work or statement by Friedman that explicitly links his economic views with individualism as a moral philosophy.\n\nI remember that Friedman wrote a book called \"Capitalism and Freedom,\" where he discussed how capitalist systems promote individual freedom. He argued that free markets allow individuals to make choices based on their own preferences and that government intervention often restricts these choices in the name of collective goals.\n\nAdditionally, he was a proponent of the idea that the primary responsibility of businesses is to increase profits, as long as they stay within the rules of the game established by law. This perspective emphasizes individual and corporate autonomy rather than collective moral considerations.\n\nSo, this reinforces my initial conclusion that Milton Friedman is the economist who advocated individualism as a guiding moral philosophy.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Milton Friedman}} \\]"
