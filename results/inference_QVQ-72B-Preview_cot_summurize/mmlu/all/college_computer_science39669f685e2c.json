Hash tables are great for average-case performance, especially for operations like insertion, deletion, and searching, all of which typically have O(1) time complexity on average.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\n**Option A: Counting distinct values**\n\nGiven a set of n keys, we need to determine how many distinct key values there are. A hash table can be really useful here. You can insert each key into the hash table, and since hash tables don't allow duplicates (or more accurately, they can be set up to ignore duplicates), the number of entries in the hash table after inserting all keys would give you the count of distinct values. So, this seems efficient.\n\n**Option B: Dynamic dictionary**\n\nThis includes operations like insert, delete, and search in a dictionary. Hash tables are famously used for this purpose. They offer efficient operations for these tasks, especially when the load factor is kept low. So, this is another case where hash tables are well-suited.\n\n**Option C: Range search**\n\nHere, we need to find all records whose key values fall within a specified range, say from a to b. Hash tables, in their standard form, aren't optimized for range queries. Hash tables typically map keys to buckets based on their hash values, which don't preserve any order of the keys. Because of this, to perform a range search, we might need to check each key individually to see if it falls within the desired range. This could potentially require scanning through all the entries in the hash table, leading to O(n) time complexity in the worst case, where n is the number of keys.\n\nIn contrast, data structures like balanced binary search trees (e.g., AVL trees, red-black trees) or B-trees can handle range searches more efficiently because they maintain a sorted order of keys. In such trees, range searches can be performed in O(log n + k), where k is the number of keys in the range.\n\n**Option D: Symbol table lookup**\n\nThis involves looking up program identifiers to find their types and addresses. Hash tables are excellent for this kind of operation. By hashing the identifier, you can quickly find its associated information. This is a common use case for hash tables in compilers and interpreters.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, it seems that hash tables might not be the most efficient choice for range searches, especially when compared to ordered data structures like trees that can handle such queries more effectively.\n\n**Final answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
