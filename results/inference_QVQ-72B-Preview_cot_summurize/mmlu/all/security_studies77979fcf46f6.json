                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these statements doesn't align with the liberalist view of the international system. I'm not entirely sure about liberalist conceptions, but I think it's similar to liberalism in politics, which emphasizes things like individual rights, democracy, and free trade. In international relations, liberalism often stresses cooperation, institutions, and interdependence.\n\nLooking at option A: \"International politics is not the same everywhere; it is only 'realist' in certain places at certain times.\" Hmm, realism is a different school of thought that focuses on power and self-interest. Liberals might acknowledge that realism applies in some situations, but they would probably argue that cooperation and institutions can overcome realist tendencies. So, maybe this suggests that realism is only relevant in certain contexts, which could be seen as acknowledging that other approaches, like liberalism, hold in different contexts. Maybe this isn't entirely against liberalism.\n\nOption B: \"The nation state does not exist as a unitary actor within the international system.\" Liberals do recognize the importance of states, but they also emphasize that states can cooperate through international institutions and organizations. They might not see states as strictly unitary actors because internal politics and transnational actors can influence state behavior. So, this seems somewhat aligned with liberalism, as they might agree that states aren't always acting as single, unified entities.\n\nOption C: \"Nation states are not basically alike.\" Liberals might argue that while states have differences based on culture, economy, politics, etc., they can still work together based on common interests and values. So, acknowledging differences doesn't necessarily contradict liberalism, as it can still promote cooperation despite those differences.\n\nOption D: \"States are and should remain the sole actors to be considered in the study of International Relations.\" This sounds more like a realist position, which prioritizes states as the primary actors in international politics. Liberals, on the other hand, recognize non-state actors like international organizations, NGOs, and transnational corporations as important players in international relations. So, this seems to contradict the liberalist conception because liberals don't limit their focus solely to states.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about that. Let me think again. Liberalism in IR theory does emphasize the role of international institutions and non-state actors. For example, liberals believe that international organizations can facilitate cooperation and reduce conflicts between states. They also consider the influence of transnational corporations and civil society groups in shaping international policies and relationships.\n\nSo, if I'm to choose which statement doesn't describe the liberalist conception, it would be option D, because it excludes non-state actors from consideration, which is contrary to liberalist views that recognize and emphasize the role of such actors in international relations.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider each option again:\n\nA. Liberals might agree that realism applies in some contexts but would also acknowledge other approaches in different contexts.\n\nB. Liberals might agree that states aren't strictly unitary actors due to internal and transnational influences.\n\nC. Liberals might agree that states differ but can still cooperate.\n\nD. Liberals disagree with the idea that only states should be considered in IR, as they recognize the significance of non-state actors.\n\nTherefore, option D is the one that doesn't describe the liberalist conception of the international system.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
