                    "text": "So I have this question here about naming chemical compounds. It asks which one is incorrectly named, and gives four options: A. CaCl2 - calcium chloride, B. Fe(NO3)3 - iron(III) nitrate, C. AlBr3 - aluminum tribromide, and D. K2Cr2O7 - potassium dichromate. I need to figure out which of these names doesn't match the chemical formula properly.\n\nFirst, I should recall the rules for naming chemical compounds, especially those involving metals and polyatomic ions. Let's start with option A: CaCl2 - calcium chloride.\n\nCalcium (Ca) is an alkaline earth metal, and it typically forms a 2+ ion. Chlorine (Cl) is a halogen and forms a 1- ion. So, CaCl2 would be calcium chloride. That seems correct.\n\nNext, option B: Fe(NO3)3 - iron(III) nitrate. Iron can have multiple oxidation states, so we need to specify the charge. Iron(III) means Fe^3+, and nitrate is NO3^-. Since there are three nitrate ions, each with a 1- charge, that balances with the Fe^3+. This also seems right.\n\nOption C: AlBr3 - aluminum tribromide. Aluminum (Al) is a group 13 metal and typically forms a 3+ ion. Bromine (Br) is a halogen and forms a 1- ion. So, AlBr3 would be aluminum bromide. But the name given is aluminum tribromide. Hmm, I think that's incorrect. \"Tribromide\" suggests three bromine atoms, which is already indicated by the subscript 3 in the formula. But in systematic naming, we don't usually use prefixes like \"tri-\" in the name when it's already clear from the formula. So, the correct name should be aluminum bromide, not aluminum tribromide.\n\nLastly, option D: K2Cr2O7 - potassium dichromate. Potassium (K) is a 1+ ion, chromium (Cr) can have different oxidation states, and oxygen (O) is 2-. In dichromate, the chromium is in the +6 oxidation state, and the dichromate ion is Cr2O7^2-. So, with two potassium ions, that balances out to K2Cr2O7. That seems correct.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems to be incorrectly named. It should be aluminum bromide instead of aluminum tribromide.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Is there ever a time when we use \"tribromide\" in naming? I think in some cases, especially with coordination compounds or other complex molecules, we might use such naming, but for a simple ionic compound like AlBr3, it should just be aluminum bromide.\n\nLet me confirm the naming rules for aluminum bromide. Aluminum is Al^3+, and bromide is Br^-, so AlBr3 is indeed aluminum bromide. The prefix \"tri-\" might be used in older naming conventions or in specific contexts, but in standard IUPAC naming, it's not necessary here.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect naming is option C: AlBr3 - aluminum tribromide. It should be aluminum bromide without the \"tri-\" prefix.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
