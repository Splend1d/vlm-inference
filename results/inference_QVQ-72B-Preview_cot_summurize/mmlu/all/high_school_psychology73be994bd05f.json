                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"The study of cognitive, behavioral, and social changes across the life span are most directly studied by which of the following? A. Psychometricians, B. Occupational psychologists, C. Developmental psychologists, D. Social psychologists.\"\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which type of psychologist focuses on changes that happen from birth through old age, looking at things like how we think, act, and interact with others as we grow.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nFirst, psychometricians. I remember that psychometrics is about measuring psychological attributes, like intelligence or personality, often through tests. But does it focus on changes across the lifespan? Maybe not directly. I think it's more about assessing these traits at a particular point in time rather than studying how they change as we age.\n\nNext, occupational psychologists. This sounds like they focus on how people behave in work settings, maybe looking at job satisfaction, performance, or career development. While they might consider different stages of life in terms of career progression, I don't think their primary focus is on overall cognitive, behavioral, and social changes from childhood to old age.\n\nThen there's developmental psychologists. This seems promising. I've heard that developmental psychology studies how people change and grow over time, from babies to elderly adults. They look at things like cognitive development, social relationships, and personality changes across different life stages. So, this seems like it directly aligns with the description in the question.\n\nLastly, social psychologists. They study how people interact with and influence each other. While they might look at social behaviors and group dynamics, I don't think their main focus is on tracking these changes from one life stage to another. They might be interested in social cognition or attitudes, which can change over time, but again, it's not their primary focus to study development across the lifespan.\n\nSo, comparing all four options, developmental psychologists seem to be the ones who most directly study cognitive, behavioral, and social changes across the entire lifespan.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Is there any chance that social psychologists also study changes across the lifespan? Well, social psychology does look at social behavior and processes, but it's not specifically about development over time. Developmental psychology, on the other hand, explicitly focuses on changes that occur as people age.\n\nOccupational psychology is more specialized, focusing on work-related behaviors and experiences, so it's not as broad as the lifespan perspective.\n\nPsychometricians are involved in measuring psychological characteristics, but again, not necessarily studying how these characteristics change over time.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. Developmental psychologists.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any overlap or if another field might also study these changes. For example, gerontologists study aging, but that's specifically focused on older adults, whereas developmental psychology covers the entire lifespan from birth onwards.\n\nSimilarly, child psychologists focus on children and adolescents, but again, not the whole lifespan.\n\nSo, yes, developmental psychology is the field that encompasses studies of cognitive, behavioral, and social changes from birth through old age.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Developmental psychologists}} \\]"
