                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what the highest possible poker hand is in a game that doesn't have any wild cards. The options are a straight flush, a royal flush, a full house, or four of a kind. Hmm, I need to remember the poker hand rankings.\n\nI know that in poker, hands are ranked based on their probability of occurring, with the least likely hands being the highest ranking. So, the royal flush is the best possible hand, right? But let me make sure.\n\nFirst, let's recall what each of these hands consists of:\n\n1. **Royal Flush:** This is when you have ten, jack, queen, king, and ace of the same suit. It's basically a straight flush that starts from ten and goes up to ace.\n\n2. **Straight Flush:** This is five consecutive cards of the same suit. So, it's a straight sequence all in the same suit, but it doesn't have to start from ten like the royal flush.\n\n3. **Four of a Kind:** This is when you have four cards of the same rank and one unrelated card.\n\n4. **Full House:** This consists of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank.\n\nNow, I think the royal flush is the highest because it's the hardest to get. But wait, maybe I should consider the probabilities to be sure.\n\nLet's think about how likely each hand is:\n\n- **Royal Flush:** There are only four possible royal flushes in a standard 52-card deck (one for each suit). So, the probability is very low.\n\n- **Straight Flush:** There are more straight flushes than royal flushes because there are many possible starting cards for a straight flush. For example, you can have 2-3-4-5-6 or 3-4-5-6-7, and so on, in each suit. So, there are more combinations here.\n\n- **Four of a Kind:** There are several ways to get four of a kind. For each rank, there are 13 choices, and then you have to choose one card from the remaining 48 cards for the fifth card.\n\n- **Full House:** This is even more common because there are many combinations of three of one rank and two of another.\n\nSo, in terms of probability, royal flush is the least likely, followed by straight flush, four of a kind, and full house.\n\nWait a minute, but I thought royal flush is the highest hand, followed by straight flush. So, according to that, royal flush should be higher than straight flush.\n\nBut let me check the answer choices again:\n\nA. straight flush\n\nB. royal flush\n\nC. full house\n\nD. four of a kind\n\nGiven that, and knowing that a royal flush is higher than a straight flush, I think the correct answer is B. royal flush.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any variation in poker rules that might change this. For example, in some games, aces can be low, meaning they can be considered the lowest card in the deck, but in standard poker, aces are high.\n\nAlso, in some variations, like Texas Hold'em, the best hand wins, and the ranking is standard.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the game is being played with multiple decks or if there are any wild cards, but the question specifies that there are no wild cards.\n\nSo, based on standard poker hand rankings, the highest possible hand is the royal flush.\n\nWait, but the options include \"straight flush\" and \"royal flush\" separately, so perhaps there is a difference between them, with royal flush being higher.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in standard poker, the hand rankings from highest to lowest are:\n\n1. Royal Flush\n\n2. Straight Flush\n\n3. Four of a Kind\n\n4. Full House\n\n5. Flush\n\n6. Straight\n\n7. Three of a Kind\n\n8. Two Pairs\n\n9. One Pair\n\n10. High Card\n\nTherefore, the highest possible poker hand in a game with no wild cards is indeed the royal flush.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if there's any hand that could beat a royal flush. No, there isn't, because it's the highest ranked hand.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. royal flush.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
