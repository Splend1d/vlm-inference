To coordinate people and resources\n\nB. To organize lines of communication\n\nC. To formalize authority\n\nD. To limit workers' rights\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an organizational structure is and what its main purposes are. An organizational structure is like the framework of a company or institution. It outlines how different roles, responsibilities, and power are arranged and coordinated. It's supposed to help the organization run smoothly, right?\n\nOption A says \"to coordinate people and resources.\" That sounds logical. If you have a structure, you can assign people to specific tasks and make sure they have the resources they need to do their jobs effectively. Without coordination, things could get chaotic.\n\nOption B is \"to organize lines of communication.\" Again, this seems important. Clear communication channels ensure that information flows properly within the organization. Knowing who to report to or who to ask for help is crucial for efficiency.\n\nOption C is \"to formalize authority.\" This is also a key aspect of organizational structures. They define who has decision-making power, who reports to whom, and establish the hierarchy. This helps in making decisions quickly and maintaining order.\n\nNow, Option D is \"to limit workers' rights.\" This seems different from the other options. Organizational structures are not typically designed to limit workers' rights. In fact, many modern organizations aim to create a fair and equitable environment where workers' rights are protected.\n\nWait a minute, maybe this is the answer. But let me double-check. If I think about it, an organizational structure should provide a framework for how work is done, but it shouldn't be there to suppress employees' rights. Things like fair treatment, equal opportunities, and adherence to labor laws are important aspects that structures should support, not undermine.\n\nMoreover, organizations that respect and promote workers' rights tend to have happier, more productive employees. So, it makes sense that limiting workers' rights wouldn't be a purpose of an organizational structure.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any scenario where limiting workers' rights could be considered a purpose of an organizational structure. Maybe in some authoritarian workplaces, but that's not generally acceptable or legal in most countries.\n\nAlso, I remember learning about different types of organizational structures, like bureaucratic, matrix, flat, and so on. None of them have \"limiting workers' rights\" as their purpose. Instead, they focus on efficiency, flexibility, or other operational aspects.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I'm pretty confident that Option D is not a purpose of an organizational structure.\n\nTo sum it up:\n\n- Option A: To coordinate people and resources \u2013 YES, that's a key purpose.\n\n- Option B: To organize lines of communication \u2013 YES, essential for effective information flow.\n\n- Option C: To formalize authority \u2013 YES, establishes the decision-making process and hierarchy.\n\n- Option D: To limit workers' rights \u2013 NO, organizations should respect and support workers' rights.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. To limit workers' rights.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
