                    "text": "So I'm trying to remember this case from my psychology law and ethics class. It's called Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California, and it happened in 1974 and 1976. I recall that it's a pretty significant case in counseling and psychology because it changed the way therapists think about confidentiality.\n\nLet me see... the question is asking what principle this case established regarding confidentiality in counseling relationships. The options are:\n\nA. Duty to warn and protect\n\nB. Responsibility to maintain privacy\n\nC. Need to obtain informed consent\n\nD. Need to maintain accurate records\n\nHmm, I think the answer is A. Duty to warn and protect. But let me make sure I'm not mixing it up with something else.\n\nI remember the story: there was a student at UC Berkeley named Prosenjit Poddar who was seeing a therapist at the university's health center. He told the therapist that he was going to kill another student, Tatiana Tarasoff. The therapist didn't report this threat, thinking that confidentiality should be maintained. Unfortunately, Tarasoff was later killed by Poddar.\n\nHer family sued the university, arguing that the therapist should have warned Tarasoff about the threat. The court agreed and established that therapists have a duty to warn identifiable victims if their clients pose a serious risk of harm.\n\nSo, this case created what's known as the \"duty to warn\" or the \"Tarasoff duty.\" It means that confidentiality isn't absolute, and in certain circumstances, therapists must break confidentiality to protect potential victims.\n\nLet me just double-check if there's any confusion between the options.\n\nOption B is responsibility to maintain privacy, which is generally a core aspect of confidentiality in therapy. But that's more about keeping what's said in therapy private, not about warning third parties.\n\nOption C is need to obtain informed consent. Informed consent is about making sure clients understand and agree to the terms of therapy, including the limits of confidentiality. While important, it's not directly what the Tarasoff case established.\n\nOption D is need to maintain accurate records. That's about documentation and record-keeping in therapy, which is separate from the confidentiality duties regarding clients and third parties.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the correct answer is A. Duty to warn and protect.\n\nWait a minute, I should make sure that there aren't any other principles that also apply here. I recall that after the Tarasoff decision, some states adopted the \"duty to protect\" standard, which might involve more than just warning the potential victim; it might require therapists to take reasonable steps to protect the victim, which could include warning them, contacting law enforcement, or hospitalizing the client.\n\nBut in the context of this question, it seems like \"duty to warn and protect\" captures both aspects. So, I think A is the best answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any connection between Tarasoff and the other options.\n\nFor example, does Tarasoff relate to maintaining privacy? Well, yes, but that's a general principle in therapy that predates Tarasoff. The case actually carved out an exception to that principle, specifying circumstances under which confidentiality can be breached.\n\nInformed consent is another fundamental aspect of therapy, but again, that was already established before Tarasoff. The case might have influenced how informed consent is explained to clients, by including the limits of confidentiality, but it didn't create the need for informed consent.\n\nAs for maintaining accurate records, that's more about documentation practices and isn't directly related to the confidentiality issues addressed in Tarasoff.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the principle established by Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California is the duty to warn and protect identifiable victims when a client poses a serious risk of harm to them.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
