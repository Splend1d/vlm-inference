                    "text": "So I have this problem here: there are 230 calories in 4 ounces of a type of ice cream, and I need to find out how many calories are in 6 ounces of that same ice cream. The options are A. 232, B. 236, C. 345, and D. 460.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what's being asked. I know that 4 ounces of this ice cream have 230 calories. I need to find out how many calories are in 6 ounces of the same ice cream. It seems like it should be a straightforward proportion problem.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many calories are in one ounce of this ice cream. If 4 ounces have 230 calories, then per ounce, it would be 230 divided by 4. Let me calculate that:\n\n230 \u00f7 4 = 57.5 calories per ounce.\n\nNow, if 6 ounces have how many calories? Well, if one ounce has 57.5 calories, then 6 ounces should have 57.5 times 6.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n57.5 \u00d7 6 =\n\nWell, 60 \u00d7 6 is 360, and 57.5 is a bit less than 60, so it should be 345 calories.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Maybe I can set up a proportion.\n\nSo, 4 ounces : 230 calories = 6 ounces : x calories.\n\nTo find x, I can cross-multiply and solve:\n\n4x = 6 \u00d7 230\n\n4x = 1380\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4:\n\nx = 1380 \u00f7 4\n\nx = 345 calories.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to look at it. Maybe using decimals or fractions differently.\n\nAlternatively, I could set it up as a ratio. If 4 ounces have 230 calories, then 6 ounces would have (230 / 4) \u00d7 6 calories.\n\nAs I did before, 230 divided by 4 is 57.5 calories per ounce, times 6 is 345 calories.\n\nAnother way, perhaps using fractions. Like, the calories per ounce is 230 over 4, and for 6 ounces, it's (230/4) \u00d7 6.\n\nAgain, that's the same as before, resulting in 345 calories.\n\nI think I'm consistent in getting 345 calories for 6 ounces.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor that could affect this. For example, does the type of ice cream change its calorie content per ounce? No, the problem says it's the same type of ice cream, so the calorie per ounce should remain the same.\n\nAlso, assuming that the calorie content is uniformly distributed, so the calories per ounce are constant.\n\nWait, but in reality, ice cream might have variations, but for this problem, I think it's safe to assume a constant calorie per ounce ratio.\n\nLet me see what the options are again:\n\nA. 232\n\nB. 236\n\nC. 345\n\nD. 460\n\nMy calculation keeps leading me to C. 345, but let's see if there's a mistake somewhere.\n\nMaybe I should consider that 6 ounces is 1.5 times 4 ounces, since 4 \u00d7 1.5 = 6.\n\nSo, if 4 ounces have 230 calories, then 1.5 times that should be 230 \u00d7 1.5.\n\nWhat's 230 times 1.5?\n\nWell, 200 \u00d7 1.5 is 300, and 30 \u00d7 1.5 is 45, so total is 345 calories.\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, using decimals: 6 divided by 4 is 1.5, so 230 multiplied by 1.5 gives 345.\n\nSeems consistent across different methods.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the units. Calories are additive, so if you have more ounces, calories increase linearly with the weight, assuming constant calorie density.\n\nI don't think there's any other factor to consider here.\n\nLet me check if there's any trick in the question. The problem says \"how many calories are in 6 ounces of that ice cream?\" and provides options. It doesn't mention anything about serving sizes or partial consumption, so I think it's straightforward.\n\nAlso, confirming the initial information: 230 calories in 4 ounces. That's clear.\n\nI think I'm confident with the answer being 345 calories for 6 ounces.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider significant figures. The initial data has three significant figures: 230 calories (which has two, but in context, probably three), and 4 ounces (which is precise). So, my answer should have three significant figures, which 345 does have.\n\nOption D is 460, which would be 460 calories, but that seems too high because 4 ounces have 230, so 6 ounces should have less than double that, since 230 \u00d7 1.5 = 345, which is less than 460.\n\nOption A is 232, which seems too low compared to 230 for 4 ounces.\n\nOption B is 236, which is also lower than 230, but that doesn't make sense because 6 is greater than 4, so calories should increase.\n\nTherefore, the only logical option is C. 345.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{345} \\]"
