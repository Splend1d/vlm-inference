                    "text": "So I have this question about heterotrophs, and I need to pick which statement is correct. Let me see, what do I know about heterotrophs? Hmm, heterotrophs are organisms that can't produce their own food from inorganic substances like autotrophs do. So, they have to get their food from other sources, usually by eating other organisms or their byproducts.\n\nOption A says that heterotrophs obtain their energy from sunlight, harnessed by pigments. Wait, but I thought only autotrophs like plants use sunlight for energy through photosynthesis. They have chlorophyll and other pigments to capture sunlight. Heterotrophs don't typically have those pigments, do they? So, maybe this isn't correct.\n\nOption B says that heterotrophs obtain their energy by oxidizing organic molecules. That sounds familiar. I remember that heterotrophs break down organic materials to release energy, which is used for their life processes. So, oxidizing organic molecules seems to align with that. Maybe this is the right answer.\n\nOption C says that heterotrophs make organic molecules from CO2. No, that sounds like what autotrophs do. Plants take in carbon dioxide and use it to make glucose and other organic compounds. Heterotrophs, on the other hand, need to consume organic molecules because they can't make them themselves. So, this can't be right.\n\nOption D says that heterotrophs obtain their energy by consuming exclusively autotrophs. Well, some heterotrophs do eat autotrophs, like animals that eat plants, but not all heterotrophs consume only autotrophs. There are decomposers like bacteria and fungi that break down dead organic matter, which could be from either autotrophs or other heterotrophs. So, this seems too narrow.\n\nBetween options A, B, and C, option B seems to be the most accurate. Heterotrophs do obtain their energy by breaking down organic molecules, which involves oxidation processes. That makes sense because they can't make their own food and have to rely on consuming others for their energy needs.\n\nLet me double-check. Autotrophs make their own food using inorganic substances and an energy source like sunlight or chemicals, while heterotrophs must consume organic matter to survive. So, heterotrophs don't use sunlight directly for energy; they use the organic matter they eat, which was produced by autotrophs, possibly through several trophic levels.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct choice: heterotrophs obtain their energy by oxidizing organic molecules.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
