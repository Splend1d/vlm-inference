                    "text": "Okay, so I have this question about GDP. GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, right? It's like the total value of all the goods and services produced in a country in a specific time period. So, I need to figure out which of these options will affect GDP.\n\nOption A says, \"You lose $50 betting with a friend.\" Hmm, betting between friends is probably not something that gets counted in GDP. It's a private transaction, and GDP is about the official production and exchange of goods and services in an economy. So, I think this doesn't affect GDP.\n\nOption B: \"You fix your brother's car without buying any new parts.\" So, fixing a car is a service, but if I'm doing it for free, without any payment changing hands, it might not be counted in GDP. GDP is based on market transactions, meaning money has to change hands for something to be included in GDP. Since I'm not getting paid for this, I think it doesn't affect GDP.\n\nOption C: \"Your father's firm makes computers and exports them to China.\" Now, this sounds like it should affect GDP. Making computers is production, and exporting them means they're being sold to another country. GDP includes exports because they're part of the total production and sales of a country. So, this should increase GDP, right?\n\nOption D: \"You buy 1000 shares of stock in a corporation.\" Buying stocks is an investment in financial assets, but does it count towards GDP? I think GDP includes investments in physical assets like buildings and equipment, but buying stocks is more about ownership in a company, not necessarily contributing to the production of goods and services. So, probably not.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems to be the one that affects GDP. Wait, but the question says \"which of the following will have an effect on GDP?\" and it's multiple choice, so maybe there's more to it.\n\nLet me double-check. In option A, losing money in a bet might affect personal finances, but it doesn't contribute to the production of goods and services. In option B, fixing the car for free is a service, but since it's not paid for, it's likely not included in GDP. Option C is clear: producing and exporting computers should increase GDP because it's part of the country's output and exports are a component of GDP. Option D, buying stocks, is more about financial transactions, which don't directly add to GDP.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C. Your father's firm making computers and exporting them to China will have an effect on GDP.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that option B could be considered? Because sometimes, in national accounts, they try to account for informal economy activities, like unpaid work within families. But I think, in standard GDP calculations, unpaid services like fixing a brother's car without payment are not included. So, probably not.\n\nAnd option D, buying stocks, is indeed a financial transaction, which is different from real transactions in goods and services that GDP measures. So, no, that shouldn't affect GDP directly.\n\nAlright, I'm confident that option C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
