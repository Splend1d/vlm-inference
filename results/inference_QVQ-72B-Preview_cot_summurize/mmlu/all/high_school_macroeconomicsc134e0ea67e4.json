I think it's when the government tries to slow down the economy because it's growing too fast, maybe to control inflation. So, it usually involves reducing aggregate demand.\n\nOption A says decreasing money spent on social programs. That sounds like the government is spending less, which would be contractionary because it's taking money out of the economy. So, that seems like it would be contractionary.\n\nOption B is increasing income taxes. That means people have less disposable income, so they might spend less. That also sounds like it would slow down the economy, which is contractionary.\n\nOption C is canceling the annual cost of living adjustments to the salaries of government employees. Cost of living adjustments are like raises that keep up with inflation. If the government cancels these, government employees' salaries won't keep up with inflation, so their real income decreases. They might spend less, which again slows down the economy. So, this seems contractionary too.\n\nOption D is increasing money spent to pay for government projects. This sounds like the government is spending more on things like building roads, schools, etc. That would pump more money into the economy, which would stimulate growth, not slow it down. So, this seems like expansionary fiscal policy, not contractionary.\n\nWait, but the question is asking which one would not be an example of contractionary fiscal policy. So, if Option D is expansionary, then it wouldn't be contractionary. That makes sense.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure. Decreasing social program spending, increasing income taxes, and canceling cost of living adjustments all seem like they would reduce aggregate demand, which is contractionary. So, yeah, Option D stands out as increasing aggregate demand, which is the opposite of contractionary.\n\nI think the answer is D. Increasing money spent to pay for government projects.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
