Propane tanks were an essential component of the mobile homes produced by the builder. The representative told the owner that the company could supply propane tanks at $50 per tank, a substantial savings over what the owner currently paid for propane tanks. The owner asked if the company could supply 1,000 propane tanks by the end of the month, and the representative assured him that they could. The owner stated that he would think about it and decide what to do within a week. On June 3, the owner sent the following memo to the company headquarters at the address provided by the representative: \"I am happy to confirm my order of 1,000 propane tanks, to be delivered by June 30. I have always received a 10 percent discount for cash payment, so I will assume you will grant me the same discount. I will have $45,000 cash ready to give to your representative at the time of delivery. \"On June 30, the company delivered 1,000 propane tanks to the owner.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this contract law scenario. It's a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, on June 1, a mobile home builder is visited by a propane tank manufacturer's rep. The rep offers to supply propane tanks at $50 each, which is a better deal than the builder's current cost. The builder asks if they can supply 1,000 tanks by the end of the month, and the rep says yes. The builder says he'll think about it and decide within a week.\n\nOn June 3, the builder sends a memo confirming an order for 1,000 tanks to be delivered by June 30. He mentions that he usually gets a 10% discount for cash payments and assumes he'll get the same here, so he's prepared to pay $45,000 (1,000 tanks at $45 each) in cash upon delivery.\n\nNow, on June 30, the company delivers the 1,000 tanks, and the rep presents a bill for $50,000. The builder refuses to pay more than $45,000. The question is, what's the legal contract price: $45,000 or $50,000?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The contract price was $45,000 because the June 3 memo is an effective integration of their agreement.\n\nB. The contract price was $45,000 because the company didn't specifically object to the 10% discount in the builder's June 3 memo.\n\nC. The contract price was $50,000 if the discount term in the builder's memo materially altered the company's offer.\n\nD. The contract price was $50,000 even though the company's offer didn't expressly limit acceptance to the terms contained therein.\n\nOkay, first things first, let's understand the sequence of events and the nature of each communication.\n\nOn June 1, the rep makes an offer to sell propane tanks at $50 each and assures that they can supply 1,000 tanks by June 30. The builder says he'll think about it and decide within a week. So, this seems like an offer by the rep, and the builder is considering it.\n\nOn June 3, the builder sends a memo confirming the order for 1,000 tanks at $45 each (after applying a 10% discount). This memo is sent to the company headquarters. So, this appears to be the builder's acceptance of the offer but with an added condition of a 10% discount.\n\nNow, in contract law, when someone accepts an offer but tries to add new terms, it's generally considered a counteroffer. So, the builder's memo on June 3 is not just an acceptance but a counteroffer, including the term of a 10% discount.\n\nThe company then delivers the tanks on June 30 without any explicit acceptance of the counteroffer. They present a bill for $50,000, which suggests that they consider the original offer price to be binding.\n\nSo, the question is, did the builder's counteroffer change the terms of the agreement, or does the original offer price stand?\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nOption A says the contract price was $45,000 because the June 3 memo is an effective integration of their agreement. Integration refers to a written document that embodies the complete and final agreement between parties. However, in this case, the memo was sent by the builder unilaterally; there's no indication that the company agreed to the terms in the memo. So, unless the company accepted the counteroffer, the memo doesn't serve as an effective integration of the agreement. Therefore, this option seems incorrect.\n\nOption B says the contract price was $45,000 because the company didn't specifically object to the 10% discount in the builder's June 3 memo. This touches on the concept of implied acceptance or acquiescence. In contract law, if one party proposes additional terms and the other party doesn't object, sometimes those terms can become part of the contract. However, this is generally not the case unless there's a history of such practices between the parties or unless the additional terms are minor and don't materially alter the original offer. In this scenario, a 10% discount is a significant change to the price term, so it's unlikely that the company's silence would imply acceptance of such a substantial alteration. Therefore, this option is probably incorrect.\n\nOption C states that the contract price was $50,000 if the discount term in the builder's memo materially altered the terms of the company's offer. This is getting closer to the heart of the issue. In contract law, when a response to an offer includes additional or different terms, it's considered a counteroffer. The original offeror can then accept or reject these new terms. If the additional terms materially alter the original offer, and the offeror doesn't explicitly agree to them, the original terms may still apply. In this case, the 10% discount is a material alteration because it reduces the price by $5,000. Since the company didn't explicitly agree to the discount and instead delivered the tanks and presented a bill for the original price, it suggests that they didn't accept the counteroffer. Therefore, the contract price should be $50,000.\n\nOption D says the contract price was $50,000 even though the company's offer didn't expressly limit acceptance to the terms contained therein. This seems a bit confusing. The company's offer was to sell tanks at $50 each. The builder's response included a discount, which is a counteroffer. Unless the company accepted this counteroffer, the original offer isn't binding with the discounted price. The fact that the company's offer didn't limit acceptance to its terms doesn't necessarily mean that the counteroffer is accepted by the company's actions. However, by delivering the tanks and billing $50,000, the company is acting in accordance with the original offer price.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that Option C is the most accurate. The discount term materially altered the original offer, and since the company didn't explicitly accept the counteroffer, the original offer price of $50,000 stands.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nFirst, was there any prior course of dealing between the parties that might suggest that the company usually accepts such discounts? The scenario mentions that the builder has always received a 10% discount for cash payments. If this is a standard practice between them, perhaps the company implicitly agreed to the discount by accepting the order.\n\nHowever, the scenario specifies that \"I have always received a 10 percent discount for cash payment, so I will assume you will grant me the same discount.\" This suggests that while the builder has received discounts in the past, it's not necessarily a guaranteed term unless the company agrees to it each time. Moreover, the company in this scenario presented a bill for the full $50,000, indicating they did not agree to the discount this time.\n\nTherefore, unless there's a clear pattern that the company always grants the discount for cash payments, which isn't explicitly stated, the company's action in billing the full amount suggests they didn't accept the counteroffer containing the discount term.\n\nHence, the contract price should be $50,000, as per the original offer, and the builder's attempt to include a discount via a counteroffer wasn't accepted by the company.\n\nSo, the correct answer is Option C: The contract price was $50,000 if the discount term in the owner's June 3 memo materially altered the terms of the company's offer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
