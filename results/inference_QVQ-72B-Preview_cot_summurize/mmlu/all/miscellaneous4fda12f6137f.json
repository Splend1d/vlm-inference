                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about what shapes Earth's surface by moving rocks and soil around. The options are fire, lightning, water, and sunlight. Hmm, let's think about each one.\n\nFirst, fire. I know that fires can burn forests and change the landscape, but do they actually move bits of rock and soil from one place to another? Not really, right? Fire might cause erosion later because there's no plants to hold the soil, but it doesn't directly pick up rocks and soil and deposit them somewhere else. So, maybe not the best choice.\n\nNext, lightning. Lightning is like a giant spark from the sky to the ground. It can cause fires and heat the ground, but again, it doesn't directly transport rocks and soil from one place to another. Maybe it can move some small particles indirectly through the effects of fire, but that seems secondary. So, probably not the main agent for shaping Earth's surface in this way.\n\nThen there's water. Now, this sounds promising. Rivers and streams are always flowing, and they can carry a lot of sediment\u2014like sand, mud, and even small rocks\u2014downstream. They erode the land where they start and deposit the materials somewhere else, like in deltas where the river meets the ocean. Also, oceans can shape coastlines with waves that wear away at the shore and move sand and pebbles along the beach. So, water seems like a really good agent for gradually shaping Earth's surface by moving materials around.\n\nLastly, sunlight. Sunlight gives us energy, helps plants grow, and influences weather patterns. But does it directly pick up rocks and soil and move them to other places? Not really. Indirectly, sunlight can affect erosion processes by influencing vegetation, which can hold soil in place, but again, it's not a direct agent of moving materials from one location to another.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, water seems to be the best example of an agent that gradually shapes Earth's surface by transporting and depositing materials. I think the answer is C. Water.\n\nWait a minute, just to make sure. Is there any way that lightning could be considered an agent in this context? Maybe if lightning strikes a rock and causes it to break apart, but that's more about weathering than erosion and transportation of materials. Similarly, fire can cause rocks to crack due to extreme temperature changes, but again, that's more about breaking down the material than moving it to another location.\n\nAnd sunlight\u2014while it's essential for many processes on Earth, it doesn't directly involve in moving rock and soil particles from one place to another.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that water is the correct choice here. It's a natural agent that consistently erodes and deposits materials, shaping the Earth's surface over time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Water}} \\]"
