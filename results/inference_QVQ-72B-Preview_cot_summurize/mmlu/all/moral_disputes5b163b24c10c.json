                    "text": "So I'm reading this article titled \"Will Cloning Harm People?\" by Pence, and I'm trying to figure out what his main objective is. The options are:\n\nA. To use consequentialist arguments to show that cloning is immoral.\n\nB. To object to consequentialist arguments against cloning.\n\nC. To use Kant's humanity formulation to show that cloning is immoral.\n\nD. To use Kant's humanity formulation to show that cloning is morally acceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what consequentialist arguments are. Consequentialism is an ethical theory that judges the morality of an action based on its outcomes or consequences. So, if Pence is using consequentialist arguments to show that cloning is immoral, he would be arguing that the negative consequences of cloning outweigh the positive ones.\n\nOn the other hand, if he's objecting to consequentialist arguments against cloning, he might be arguing that the supposed harmful consequences of cloning are not as dire as some people claim, or that there are actually positive consequences that make cloning morally acceptable.\n\nThen there's Kant's humanity formulation, which is part of deontological ethics. Immanuel Kant proposed that people should always be treated as ends in themselves and never merely as means to an end. This is often summarized as the \"humanity formulation\" of the categorical imperative.\n\nSo, if Pence is using Kant's humanity formulation to argue that cloning is immoral, he would be suggesting that cloning treats people in ways that don't respect their intrinsic value or dignity.\n\nAlternatively, if he's using Kant's humanity formulation to show that cloning is morally acceptable, he would be arguing that cloning respects individuals as ends in themselves and doesn't use them merely as means to an end.\n\nNow, from the title \"Will Cloning Harm People?\", it seems like Pence is exploring whether cloning is harmful to people. The word \"harm\" suggests a focus on negative consequences, which aligns more with consequentialist concerns.\n\nBut I need to look deeper into the article to see which approach he takes.\n\nLet me recall some points from the article. Pence discusses various potential harms that cloning might cause, such as psychological harm to clones, social stigma, and identity issues. He also considers the idea that cloning could lead to a decrease in genetic diversity, which could have long-term negative consequences for the human species.\n\nHowever, Pence also presents counterarguments, suggesting that these supposed harms might not be as significant as feared. For example, he might argue that clones could have similar psychological profiles to their genetic predecessors but would still have their own unique experiences and identities.\n\nMoreover, he might point out that social stigma and identity issues could be addressed through education and cultural adaptation, much like how society has adapted to other reproductive technologies.\n\nGiven that Pence is considering both the potential harms and benefits of cloning, it seems like he's engaging with consequentialist arguments. But his main objective isn't just to use consequentialist arguments to show that cloning is immoral; rather, he's objecting to consequentialist arguments that claim cloning is inherently harmful.\n\nWait a minute, option B says \"to object to consequentialist arguments against cloning.\" That seems to align with what I just thought. Pence is responding to those who use consequentialist reasoning to argue against cloning, and he's providing counterpoints to show that cloning might not be as harmful as they claim.\n\nBut let's consider the other options again to make sure.\n\nOption C suggests that Pence is using Kant's humanity formulation to show that cloning is immoral. However, from what I recall, Pence doesn't focus much on Kantian ethics in this article. His main ethical framework seems to be consequentialist, not deontological.\n\nSimilarly, option D suggests that he's using Kant's humanity formulation to show that cloning is morally acceptable. Again, Pence doesn't seem to be relying on Kant's principles to make his case.\n\nOption A says that Pence is using consequentialist arguments to show that cloning is immoral, but based on my recollection, he's actually challenging the idea that cloning is necessarily harmful, which would mean he's not arguing that it's immoral on consequentialist grounds.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer should be B: to object to consequentialist arguments against cloning.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about the structure of the article. Pence likely begins by presenting the main consequentialist arguments against cloning, such as the potential for psychological harm to clones or the possible negative impacts on society. Then, he proceeds to critique these arguments, perhaps by pointing out flaws in the assumptions or by providing alternative perspectives that suggest cloning isn't necessarily harmful.\n\nFor instance, he might argue that concerns about psychological harm are speculative and not supported by existing evidence from animal clones or from studies on adoptees, who also have complex issues of identity but don't face insurmountable psychological challenges.\n\nHe could also discuss the ethical considerations of reproductive freedom and the right to procreate in ways that are technologically possible, as long as they don't cause significant harm to others.\n\nAdditionally, Pence might consider the potential benefits of cloning, such as advances in medical research, the ability to preserve endangered species, or the personal reasons why individuals might choose to clone themselves or their loved ones.\n\nOverall, Pence's approach seems to be one of balanced examination, where he evaluates the potential consequences of cloning and argues that the feared harms are not sufficient to deem cloning immoral. Therefore, his main objective is indeed to object to consequentialist arguments against cloning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
