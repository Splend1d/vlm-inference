The sum is between which numbers?\n\nA. 100 and 299\n\nB. 300 and 499\n\nC. 500 and 699\n\nD. 700 and 899\n\nSo I have this problem here: I need to estimate the sum of 153 and 44 and figure out between which two numbers the actual sum lies. The options are from 100 to 299, 300 to 499, 500 to 699, or 700 to 899.\n\nFirst, I need to estimate the sum of 153 and 44. Estimation usually involves rounding numbers to make them simpler to work with. Let's see, 153 is close to 150, and 44 is close to 40. So, if I add 150 and 40, that gives me 190. So, my estimate is 190.\n\nNow, I need to check which range includes 190. Looking at the options:\n\nA. 100 and 299\n\nB. 300 and 499\n\nC. 500 and 699\n\nD. 700 and 899\n\n190 falls within the range of 100 to 299. So, according to my estimation, the answer should be A. But wait, I should check if the actual sum is close to my estimate.\n\nLet me calculate the exact sum of 153 and 44. 153 plus 44: 153 plus 40 is 193, and then adding the remaining 4 would make it 197. So, the exact sum is 197.\n\nNow, does 197 fall within the range of 100 to 299? Yes, because 197 is between 100 and 299. It's not in the 300s, 500s, or 700s.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. Maybe I should see if there's another way to estimate or if I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can round 153 to 150 and 44 to 40, as I did before, which gives 190, and then see how much error I might have introduced by rounding. 153 is 3 more than 150, and 44 is 4 less than 40. So, my estimate is 190, but the actual sum is 153 + 44 = 197, which is higher than my estimate.\n\nLet me see: 150 + 40 = 190, and the actual numbers are 153 and 44, which total to 197. So, the difference is +7. But since 190 is still within the range of 100 to 299, and 197 is also within that range, the answer remains A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should have rounded differently. For example, rounding 153 to 150 and 44 to 40 gives 190, as I said, and the actual sum is 197, which is still in the 100s and 200s range.\n\nAnother way to estimate could be to round 153 up to 160 and 44 down to 40, giving 200, which is also in the 100 to 299 range. Or round 153 to 150 and 44 to 45, giving 195. Again, within the same range.\n\nSo, regardless of the estimation method, the sum is consistently within the 100 to 299 range.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that the sum could fall into another range. For example, if I had misrounded and got a sum that wasn't representative, but in this case, all estimation methods point to the 100 to 299 range.\n\nMoreover, the exact sum is 197, which is clearly between 100 and 299, so there's no ambiguity here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 100 and 299.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
