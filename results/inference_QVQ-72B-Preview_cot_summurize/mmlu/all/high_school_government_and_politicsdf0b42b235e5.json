                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question about voting patterns, and I need to identify which statement is NOT true. The options are:\n\nA. Non-whites are more likely to vote Democratic than are whites.\n\nB. Women are more likely to vote Democratic than are men.\n\nC. Low-income Americans are more likely to vote Democratic than are upper-income Americans.\n\nD. Evangelical Christians are more likely to vote Democratic than are non-religious Americans.\n\nOkay, so I need to recall some general trends in American politics. I know that political affiliation can be influenced by various factors like race, gender, income, and religion.\n\nStarting with option A: Non-whites are more likely to vote Democratic than whites. From what I've observed and read, this seems to be accurate. Historically, minority groups in the U.S. have tended to align more with the Democratic Party, which is often perceived as being more supportive of civil rights and social welfare programs. Whites, particularly in certain regions, have leaned more towards the Republican Party.\n\nMoving on to option B: Women are more likely to vote Democratic than men. This also rings true. There's something called the \"gender gap\" in voting where women tend to favor the Democratic Party more than men do. The Democratic Party is often seen as more supportive of issues like reproductive rights, equal pay, and social programs that benefit families.\n\nOption C: Low-income Americans are more likely to vote Democratic than upper-income Americans. This seems logical because the Democratic Party is generally associated with progressive taxation and social safety nets, which would benefit lower-income individuals. The Republican Party, on the other hand, tends to favor tax cuts for higher earners and may be less supportive of extensive social welfare programs.\n\nLastly, option D: Evangelical Christians are more likely to vote Democratic than non-religious Americans. Hmm, this one seems a bit counterintuitive. I know that Evangelical Christians have traditionally been a strong base for the Republican Party, particularly due to conservative stances on social issues like abortion and same-sex marriage. Non-religious Americans, or those with no religious affiliation, might be more inclined towards the Democratic Party, which is generally more liberal on social issues.\n\nWait a minute, so if Evangelical Christians are more likely to vote Republican and non-religious Americans are more likely to vote Democratic, then stating that Evangelical Christians are more likely to vote Democratic than non-religious Americans would be incorrect.\n\nLet me double-check this. According to various polls and election data, Evangelical Christians do tend to vote Republican at higher rates than the general population. For example, in recent presidential elections, a large majority of Evangelical voters cast their ballots for the Republican candidate. In contrast, non-religious voters are more likely to support Democratic candidates.\n\nSo, based on this, option D seems to be the incorrect statement. It contradicts the general trend where Evangelical Christians are more likely to vote Republican, not Democratic, compared to non-religious Americans.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Option A: Generally true.\n\n- Option B: Generally true.\n\n- Option C: Generally true.\n\n- Option D: Not true, as Evangelical Christians are more likely to vote Republican than Democratic, whereas non-religious Americans are more likely to vote Democratic.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT true is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
