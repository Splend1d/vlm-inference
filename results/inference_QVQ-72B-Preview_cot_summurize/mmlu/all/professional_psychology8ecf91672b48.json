I've heard that job satisfaction is important, but I'm not sure exactly how it relates to job performance and health. Maybe I should start by looking up some research on this topic.\n\nLet me see... I recall that there have been many studies on job satisfaction and its effects on various aspects of life. Perhaps I can look for meta-analyses or review articles that summarize multiple studies to get a better understanding.\n\nFirst, I'll search for \"job satisfaction and job performance\" in some academic databases. Oh, wait, I don't have access to databases right now. Maybe I can look for free resources or summaries online.\n\nOkay, found something. It says that several studies have found a positive relationship between job satisfaction and job performance. For example, a happy and satisfied employee is more likely to be productive and perform well at work. So, that suggests that job satisfaction can predict job performance.\n\nBut, I should check if this is consistent across different jobs and industries. Maybe some jobs require specific skills or traits that aren't directly influenced by satisfaction.\n\nAlso, I found another study that suggests that while there is a relationship, it might not be as strong as people think. Maybe there are other factors at play, like personality traits or work environment, that affect both job satisfaction and performance.\n\nHmm, so perhaps job satisfaction is correlated with job performance, but it might not be the only predictor.\n\nNow, what about health? Does job satisfaction predict health outcomes?\n\nI know that stress at work can affect physical and mental health. If someone is dissatisfied with their job, they might experience more stress, which could lead to health problems like hypertension, depression, or burnout.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone is satisfied with their job, they might have better mental well-being and fewer health issues.\n\nThere seems to be a consensus that job satisfaction is linked to mental health and, to some extent, physical health.\n\nBut again, I should consider if this relationship is causal. Does job satisfaction directly cause changes in health, or is it just correlated?\n\nProbably, it's a bit of both. Job satisfaction can influence behavior and stress levels, which in turn affect health. So, it might be an indirect effect.\n\nAlso, individual differences might play a role here. Some people might be more resilient to job dissatisfaction than others.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that job satisfaction is a significant predictor of both job performance and health.\n\nWait a minute, but one of the options says \"both job performance and health,\" which is option A.\n\nOption B says \"job performance but not health.\" But from what I've read, it seems that job satisfaction does predict health, so this can't be right.\n\nOption C says \"health but not job performance.\" Again, that contradicts what I've found about the relationship between job satisfaction and job performance.\n\nOption D says \"neither job performance nor health.\" That seems unlikely based on the research I've come across.\n\nSo, the most accurate answer should be option A: both job performance and health.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nI found another study that suggests that while job satisfaction is related to job performance, the relationship with health is more complex and moderated by factors like social support and personal resources.\n\nStill, even with these moderating factors, job satisfaction remains an important predictor.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it. Job satisfaction is an accurate predictor of both job performance and health.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
