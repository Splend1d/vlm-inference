Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these psychological approaches would emphasize the importance of spreading genes as a major motivator for human behavior.\n\nFirst, let's recall what each type of psychology focuses on. Starting with cognitive psychology (Option A), that's all about mental processes like thinking, memory, perception, problem-solving, and learning. It's more about how we process information and make decisions. Doesn't sound like it directly ties into spreading genetic material, does it? Maybe not.\n\nOption B is evolutionary psychology. I've heard of this one. It's about how evolutionary principles can be applied to understand human behavior. It often looks at behaviors that might have provided survival or reproductive advantages in the past. So, spreading genetic material sounds a lot like reproductive success, which is right up evolutionary psychology's alley. Maybe this is the answer.\n\nBut let's check the others to be sure. Option C is humanistic psychology. I remember this approach emphasizes personal growth, self-actualization, and the inherent goodness of humans. It's more about fulfilling one's potential and less about biological imperatives like spreading genes. So, probably not this one.\n\nOption D is psychodynamic psychology, which is largely influenced by Freud's theories. It focuses on unconscious processes and early childhood experiences shaping personality and behavior. While there is some emphasis on sexual drives in Freud's theory, it's more about repressed sexual desires and their impact on behavior rather than directly about spreading genetic material.\n\nComparing all these, evolutionary psychology seems to be the most fitting choice because it directly links human behaviors to evolutionary advantages, particularly reproductive success. So, I think the answer is B. evolutionary psychologist.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider a specific example. Suppose someone is attracted to certain traits in a partner that indicate health and fertility. An evolutionary psychologist would likely explain this as an innate preference evolved to maximize the chances of producing healthy offspring, thus spreading one's genes more effectively. That seems pretty on-point with the question's description.\n\nWhereas a cognitive psychologist might focus on how we perceive and evaluate potential partners, a humanistic psychologist might emphasize personal connection and growth in relationships, and a psychodynamic psychologist might look at underlying sexual motivations or early attachments. None of these directly equate to the desire to spread genetic material as a key motivation.\n\nSo, I'm confident that B. evolutionary psychologist is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
