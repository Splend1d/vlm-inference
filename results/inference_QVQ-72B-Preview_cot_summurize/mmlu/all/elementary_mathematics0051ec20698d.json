I'm supposed to round to the nearest hundredth if necessary.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a unit rate is. A unit rate is basically how much of one thing per another thing. In this case, it's kilometers per hour, which tells me how far I can travel in one hour at a constant speed.\n\nSo, if I drove 308 kilometers in 4 hours, to find out how many kilometers I drove per hour, I should divide the total distance by the total time.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nDistance = 308 km\n\nTime = 4 hours\n\nUnit rate = Distance / Time = 308 km / 4 h\n\nNow, 308 divided by 4. Let me do that calculation.\n\n308 \u00f7 4 = ...\n\nWell, 4 times 77 is 308, because 4 \u00d7 70 = 280 and 4 \u00d7 7 = 28, so 280 + 28 = 308.\n\nSo, 308 \u00f7 4 = 77 km/h\n\nTherefore, the unit rate is 77 km/h.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 82 km/h\n\nB. 74 km/h\n\nC. 72 km/h\n\nD. 77 km/h\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says to round to the nearest hundredth if necessary. But in this case, the division gave me a whole number, 77, so no need to round.\n\nI think the answer is D. 77 km/h.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps using the formula for speed.\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\nWhich is what I already did. Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of rates and proportions.\n\nIf 4 hours correspond to 308 km, then 1 hour corresponds to how many kilometers.\n\nI can set up a proportion: 4 hours / 308 km = 1 hour / x km\n\nCross-multiplying: 4 * x = 308 * 1\n\nSo, 4x = 308\n\nNow, solve for x: x = 308 / 4 = 77 km/h\n\nAgain, that confirms the unit rate is 77 km/h.\n\nMaybe I can try another approach, like using decimals or fractions, but it's unnecessary since division directly gives the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a trick in the question about rounding to the nearest hundredth, but since the answer is exactly 77, no need to round.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is D. 77 km/h.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
