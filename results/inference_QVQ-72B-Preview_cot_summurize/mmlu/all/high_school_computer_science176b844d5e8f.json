Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Python, operators have a specific order of precedence. For example, multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction. Also, there's something called the modulus operator, which is the % symbol. It returns the remainder when you divide two numbers.\n\nSo, in this expression, 1 + 3 % 3, I need to figure out the order in which these operations are performed. I think the modulus operation should be done before addition, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up the operator precedence in Python.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that in Python, the modulus operator (%) has higher precedence than addition (+). So, that means 3 % 3 will be evaluated first, and then I'll add 1 to the result of that.\n\nNow, what's 3 % 3? Well, modulus gives the remainder after division. So, 3 divided by 3 is 1 with a remainder of 0. Therefore, 3 % 3 should be 0.\n\nSo, the expression becomes 1 + 0, which is just 1.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Is there any chance that the addition could happen before the modulus? No, since modulus has higher precedence. So, yes, it's safe to evaluate it as 1 + (3 % 3), which is 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nI think the answer is B. 1.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other interpretations. For example, could the addition be happening before the modulus? No, because precedence dictates that modulus is evaluated first.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use parentheses to make it explicit. So, if I write it as 1 + (3 % 3), that clearly evaluates to 1 + 0 = 1. Alternatively, if there were no modulus, like 1 + 3 / 3, that would be different, but in this case, it's 1 + 0.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here; it's straightforward. The modulus of 3 and 3 is 0, and adding 1 to 0 gives 1.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 1} \\]"
