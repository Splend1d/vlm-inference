The question gives four options, and I need to pick the one that best represents Rawls' view. Let me think through each option carefully.\n\nOption A says that a conception of justice should be deduced from self-evident premises. Now, deducing something from self-evident premises sounds a bit like starting with axioms that are obviously true and then logically deriving principles from them. In philosophy, this approach is similar to rationalism, where reason and logical deduction are primary ways of knowing truth. But I recall that Rawls was critical of this approach. He didn't think that there were self-evident moral premises from which we could deduce a complete theory of justice. Instead, he believed that our moral concepts are complex and require a more nuanced approach. So, I don't think this is the right answer.\n\nOption B suggests direct acquaintance via moral intuition. Moral intuitionism is a theory that holds that some moral truths are self-evident and can be known directly through intuition. However, Rawls was not an intuitionist. He thought that moral intuitions could be unreliable and that they needed to be systematically reflected upon and organized into a coherent framework. So, relying solely on moral intuition isn't consistent with Rawls' approach. He wanted a more systematic and reflective equilibrium between our considered moral judgments and the principles of justice.\n\nOption C proposes that a conception of justice should be justified by the mutual support of many considerations, which fit into one coherent view. This sounds a lot like Rawls' method of reflective equilibrium. Reflective equilibrium is a process where we balance our considered moral judgments with the general principles that best fit those judgments. It's an iterative process where we adjust our principles and judgments back and forth until they reach a stable equilibrium. So, in this option, the idea is that a conception of justice should be supported by many different considerations\u2014such as our moral intuitions, our understanding of fairness, our conceptions of equality and liberty\u2014and these considerations should all fit together coherently. This seems very much in line with Rawls' approach.\n\nOption D is \"none of the above,\" which I should consider, but given that I've found option C to align with Rawls' reflective equilibrium, I don't think this is the correct choice.\n\nTo make sure I'm not missing something, let me double-check. Rawls was known for his work in political philosophy, particularly his theory of justice as fairness, which he developed through the veil of ignorance and original position thought experiments. But the method he used to justify his principles of justice was indeed reflective equilibrium. He believed that our moral principles should be consistent with our deeply held moral convictions and that any inconsistencies should lead us to revise either our principles or our judgments, striving for a coherent whole.\n\nSo, based on this understanding, option C is the best answer. It captures the essence of Rawls' approach to justifying a conception of justice through the mutual support of many considerations fitted into one coherent view.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
