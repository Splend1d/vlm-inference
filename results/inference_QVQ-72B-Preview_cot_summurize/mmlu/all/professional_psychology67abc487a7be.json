                    "text": "So I have this question here about the \"in-basket\" technique in personnel selection. It's asking for the most likely use of this technique with which type of employee, and the options are Clerical, Sales, Managerial, or Secretarial. Hmm, I need to think about this.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what an \"in-basket\" technique is. From what I recall, it's a type of assessment used in selection processes where candidates are presented with a simulated workload or a set of tasks that they would typically encounter in the job they're applying for. It's like a practical test to see how they handle day-to-day responsibilities.\n\nNow, considering that, I need to match this technique with the most appropriate type of employee from the options given.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Clerical positions. Clerical jobs usually involve a lot of administrative work, like data entry, filing, answering phones, etc. These tasks can be quite routine and detail-oriented. An in-basket exercise might be useful here because it can test how well a candidate can manage and prioritize tasks, which is crucial in clerical work. So, it seems like a possible fit.\n\nNext, Sales positions. Sales jobs are all about generating business, making deals, and meeting targets. They often require strong communication skills, negotiation abilities, and sometimes product knowledge. An in-basket exercise might not be the primary way to assess these skills. Maybe there are better assessment methods for sales positions, like role-plays or case studies. So, perhaps not the top choice.\n\nThen, Managerial positions. Management involves a wide range of responsibilities, including leading teams, making decisions, planning, and sometimes dealing with complex business issues. An in-basket exercise could be very relevant here because managers often have to handle a multitude of tasks and prioritize their time effectively. This kind of assessment could evaluate their ability to make decisions under time pressure, delegate tasks, and organize their workflow. That sounds like a great fit.\n\nLastly, Secretarial positions. Secretarial work is similar to clerical work but might involve more advanced administrative tasks, like scheduling meetings, handling correspondence, and sometimes assisting higher-level staff. While an in-basket exercise could be useful for assessing task management and prioritization, I think it might be more tailored towards the higher-level decision-making and problem-solving required in managerial roles.\n\nComparing all these, I think Managerial positions would be the most likely type of employee for which an in-basket technique would be used. It just seems to align perfectly with the nature of the tasks and responsibilities that managers have to handle.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe it's also highly used in Clerical or Secretarial positions? After all, those roles also involve a lot of task management and prioritization. However, in managerial positions, the complexity and stakes are often higher, and an in-basket exercise might provide deeper insights into a candidate's abilities in those areas.\n\nAdditionally, I recall that in-basket tests are commonly used in assessment centers for management and executive positions. They are considered an effective way to evaluate decision-making skills, time management, and the ability to handle pressure, all of which are critical for managerial roles.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I would say that the most likely use of an \"in-basket\" technique in personnel selection is with Managerial type of employees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C.
