                    "text": "So I've got this investment that's going to pay me $10 every year, forever. That sounds pretty straightforward. The question is, what's that investment worth right now if the market discount rate is 5%? The options are $100, $2, $500, or $200.\n\nHmm, I remember that when you have a perpetual payment, like something that pays out the same amount every year forever, you can use a formula to find its present value. Let's see, the formula for the present value of a perpetuity is the annual payment divided by the discount rate.\n\nSo, if I have an annual payment of $10 and the discount rate is 5%, I need to divide $10 by 5% to find the present value.\n\nWait, but 5% is the same as 0.05, right? So, $10 divided by 0.05 should be $200.\n\nLet me double-check that. If I have a perpetuity paying $10 each year and the discount rate is 5%, then the present value should indeed be $10 divided by 0.05, which equals $200.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Is this a simple perpetuity, or could there be any complications, like growth in the payment or anything like that?\n\nThe problem says it pays out $10 p.a. forever, and there's no mention of any growth in the payment. So, it should be a simple perpetuity.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the value of the investment is the sum of all future payments discounted back to today at the market discount rate.\n\nSo, the present value PV is the sum from t=1 to infinity of $10 divided by (1 + r)^t, where r is the discount rate.\n\nFor a perpetuity, this sum converges to the annual payment divided by the discount rate, which again is $10 / 0.05 = $200.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D is $200. So, that seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this.\n\nIs there any initial investment or cost associated with the investment? The problem doesn't mention any cost; it just says \"what is the investment worth.\" So, I assume there's no initial outlay, and the worth is solely based on the future payments.\n\nAlso, is the discount rate appropriately given? Yes, it's specified as 5%, so that should be fine.\n\nMaybe I should think about the concept here. The idea is that the present value of these future payments is what determines the current worth of the investment.\n\nAnother angle: if I were to buy this investment and receive $10 every year, and I require a 5% return on my investment, then paying $200 for it would give me a 5% return because $10 is 5% of $200.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the present value formula, PV = PMT / r, where PMT is the annual payment and r is the discount rate. Plugging in PMT = $10 and r = 0.05 gives PV = $200.\n\nI don't see any flaw in this calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the time value of money more carefully. The first payment is received one year from now, the second two years from now, and so on.\n\nThe present value is indeed the sum of an infinite series, where each term is $10 divided by (1 + r)^t, for t from 1 to infinity.\n\nThis is a geometric series with the first term a = $10 / (1 + r) = $10 / 1.05 \u2248 $9.5238, and the common ratio r = 1 / 1.05 \u2248 0.95238.\n\nThe sum of an infinite geometric series is a / (1 - r), which is ($10 / 1.05) / (1 - 1/1.05) = ($10 / 1.05) / (0.05 / 1.05) = $10 / 0.05 = $200.\n\nSo, even breaking it down like this, I end up with $200.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The answer should simply be $200, which corresponds to option D.\n\nJust to make sure, let's look at the other options:\n\nA. $100: That would imply a 10% return because $10 is 10% of $100, but the discount rate is 5%, so this doesn't match.\n\nB. $2: That's way too low; $10 is 5,000% of $2, which is way higher than the 5% discount rate.\n\nC. $500: $10 is 2% of $500, which is less than the 5% discount rate, so this wouldn't provide the required return.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. $200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
