                    "text": "I'm trying to understand Lyotard's dictum: \"I define postmodern as incredulity toward meta-narratives.\" I need to choose which option best explains what this means. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, what is a meta-nnarative? From what I recall, a meta-narrative is a large-scale or master narrative that constructs or guides individual narratives. These are often grand stories or theories that provide a comprehensive explanation or meaning for events, experiences, or phenomena. For example, religion, Marxism, or the idea of progress in history could be considered meta-narratives.\n\nNow, \"incredulity\" means a lack of belief or doubt. So, Lyotard is saying that postmodernism is characterized by a skepticism or disbelief towards these grand narratives.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Individual stories are suspect.\n\nDoes postmodernism doubt individual stories because of a disbelief in meta-narratives? Hmm. I think postmodernism actually emphasizes the importance of individual stories and the idea that there are multiple narratives rather than a single, overarching one. So, maybe not.\n\nB. The law is static.\n\nThis seems unrelated to the concept of meta-narratives. Postmodernism might question the absolute nature of laws and norms, but this option suggests that the law is unchanging, which doesn't directly align with Lyotard's statement.\n\nC. Universal values are meaningless.\n\nThis could be related because meta-narratives often promote universal truths or values. If postmodernism is incredulous towards meta-narratives, it might also be skeptical of universal values. However, this seems a bit too strong. Postmodernism might question the existence of universal values, but it doesn't necessarily render them meaningless.\n\nD. Literature reproduces repression.\n\nThis seems to suggest that literature perpetuates oppressive systems, which might be a critique within postmodern thought, but it doesn't directly relate to the concept of meta-narratives.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps none of these options perfectly capture Lyotard's dictum, but I have to pick the closest one.\n\nLet me consider that meta-narratives often claim universal validity and can impose a single way of understanding the world. Postmodernism, by expressing incredulity towards these, is resisting such totalizing claims and embracing plurality and diversity in narratives.\n\nGiven that, option C, \"universal values are meaningless,\" seems to align somewhat with this resistance to universal claims. However, I'm still not entirely comfortable with the word \"meaningless.\" It might be more accurate to say that postmodernism questions the existence or applicability of universal values, rather than declaring them meaningless.\n\nOption A, \"individual stories are suspect,\" seems contradictory because postmodernism often values individual and local narratives over grand narratives. So, suspecting individual stories doesn't make much sense in that context.\n\nOption B, \"the law is static,\" doesn't seem directly related to meta-narratives or postmodernism's attitude towards them. Postmodernism might view laws as constructed and subject to change, but this option suggests stasis, which doesn't fit well.\n\nOption D, \"literature reproduces repression,\" might be a critique within postmodern literary theory, but it doesn't directly follow from a disbelief in meta-narratives. It seems more specific to literature and doesn't capture the broader implications of Lyotard's statement.\n\nPerhaps the closest answer is C, but I still feel like it's not entirely accurate. Maybe I need to consider that postmodernism, by being incredulous towards meta-narratives, is rejecting the idea of universal values that meta-narratives often promote. So, in that sense, universal values are considered less valid or applicable to everyone, which could be interpreted as them being \"meaningless\" in a postmodern context.\n\nHowever, I think \"meaningless\" is too strong of a word. Postmodernism might suggest that universal values are not applicable to everyone or that they mask particular interests, but it doesn't necessarily render them completely without meaning.\n\nGiven the choices, I'll go with option C, but with some reservations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
