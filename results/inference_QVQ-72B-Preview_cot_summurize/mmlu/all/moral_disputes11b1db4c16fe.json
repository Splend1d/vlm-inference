                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Corvino's reading of Aquinas regarding \"unnatural\" sexual acts. The options are:\n\nA. deliberately pro-creative.\n\nB. non-consensual.\n\nC. deliberately non-procreative.\n\nD. uncommonly practiced among adults.\n\nAnd the question is, according to Corvino's interpretation of Aquinas, which of these characterizes \"unnatural\" sexual acts?\n\nFirst off, I need to recall who Corvino is and what his take on Aquinas is. I think Corvino is a philosopher who has written about sexual ethics, particularly from a Thomistic perspective. Thomism, of course, refers to the philosophical and theological teachings of Thomas Aquinas.\n\nNow, Aquinas is famous for his views on natural law and sexual morality. In his ethics, especially in the Summa Theologica, he discusses the nature and purpose of human sexuality. According to Aquinas, the natural purpose of sexual acts is procreation and the expression of marital love within marriage.\n\nSo, based on that, I would initially think that \"unnatural\" acts would be those that go against this natural purpose, which is procreation. That would suggest that deliberately non-procreative acts would be considered \"unnatural.\"\n\nOption C says \"deliberately non-procreative.\" That seems to align with my initial thought.\n\nBut let's consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is \"deliberately pro-creative.\" This seems to be in line with the natural purpose of sexual acts, so it wouldn't be considered \"unnatural.\"\n\nOption B is \"non-consensual.\" While non-consensual sex is morally wrong and unethical, I don't think Aquinas would categorize it as \"unnatural\" in the same way he categorizes certain types of sexual acts. Aquinas emphasizes consent in marriage, but I don't recall him labeling non-consensual acts as \"unnatural\" in the same sense as acts that are ordered towards procreation.\n\nOption D is \"uncommonly practiced among adults.\" This seems too vague and doesn't necessarily relate to the natural law or the purpose of sexual acts. Just because something is uncommon doesn't make it \"unnatural\" in the moral sense Aquinas is discussing.\n\nGiven this analysis, option C, \"deliberately non-procreative,\" seems to be the most fitting choice.\n\nHowever, I should double-check this. I recall that Aquinas discussed various types of sexual acts that are considered vices, such as lust, which involves disordered desire. He also discusses acts that are against nature, like those that don't aim at procreation.\n\nOne specific teaching is about acts that are \"ordained towards procreation\" and those that aren't. He would likely consider acts that deliberately avoid procreation as \"unnatural.\"\n\nBut I should consider if there's more to it. For example, does Aquinas consider all non-procreative acts as \"unnatural,\" or only those that are deliberately so?\n\nI think Aquinas would distinguish between acts that are intrinsically ordered towards procreation and those that are not. For example, sexual acts within marriage that are open to procreation are natural, while acts that close off the possibility of procreation, like contraception, would be considered unnatural.\n\nSimilarly, acts that are not open to procreation, like same-sex acts, would also be considered unnatural because they cannot achieve the natural end of procreation.\n\nSo, in that case, \"deliberately non-procreative\" might not capture the full scope of what Aquinas considers \"unnatural,\" as he might consider some acts as inherently non-procreative, regardless of deliberate intention.\n\nBut the question specifies \"deliberately non-procreative,\" which suggests that the intention to avoid procreation makes an act unnatural.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I need to think about this differently. Maybe Corvino interprets Aquinas as focusing on the intention behind the act, not just the intrinsic nature of the act itself.\n\nIf that's the case, then deliberately choosing acts that are not open to procreation would be considered unnatural.\n\nBut I need to confirm this.\n\nLet me try to look up some of Aquinas's writings on this topic.\n\nIn the Summa Theologica, Aquinas discusses the moral aspects of human acts, including sexual acts. Specifically, in the Second Part of the Summa, he addresses various vices, including lust.\n\nHe defines lust as \"an inordinate love of venereal pleasure\" (ST II-II, q.154, a.1). But he also discusses the morality of sexual acts in terms of their ends and means.\n\nIn particular, he argues that sexual acts are good when they are ordered towards procreation and the bond of marriage. Acts that deviate from this order are considered immoral.\n\nFor example, he condemns acts like contraception and bestiality as unnatural because they frustrate the natural end of sexual intercourse, which is procreation.\n\nSimilarly, he would likely consider homosexual acts as unnatural because they cannot achieve procreation.\n\nBut again, the question is about Corvino's reading of Aquinas, not necessarily Aquinas himself.\n\nI need to consider how Corvino interprets Aquinas on this point.\n\nFrom what I recall, Corvino is known for his work on sexual ethics, and he has engaged with Aquinas's thought in this area.\n\nIn his writings, Corvino has defended the traditional view that sexual acts should be open to procreation. He argues that acts that deliberately close off the possibility of procreation are immoral.\n\nFor instance, in his debates on same-sex marriage, Corvino has emphasized the importance of procreation in defining the nature of marriage.\n\nTherefore, based on Corvino's interpretation of Aquinas, it seems that \"unnatural\" sexual acts are those that are deliberately non-procreative.\n\nThis would align with option C.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's any other aspect that Corvino might consider in defining \"unnatural\" acts.\n\nFor example, could non-consensual acts be considered \"unnatural\" in Corvino's reading of Aquinas?\n\nWhile Aquinas emphasizes the importance of consent in marriage, I don't think he categorizes non-consensual acts as \"unnatural\" in the same way he does with acts that are ordered towards procreation.\n\nMoreover, the question specifies \"sexual acts,\" and Aquinas's discussion of non-consensual acts might not fall under the category of sexual acts in the same moral sense.\n\nTherefore, option B seems less likely.\n\nOption D, \"uncommonly practiced among adults,\" doesn't seem relevant to Aquinas's moral framework, which is based on natural law and the purposes of human acts, not on their frequency or commonality.\n\nOption A, \"deliberately pro-creative,\" seems to align with the natural purpose of sexual acts, so it wouldn't be considered \"unnatural.\"\n\nTherefore, after considering all the options, I believe the correct answer is C. deliberately non-procreative.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
