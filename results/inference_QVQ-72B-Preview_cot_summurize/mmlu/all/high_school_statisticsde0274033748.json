                    "text": "Let's see. I have this probability problem here. So, from my high school, 54% of graduates go to 4-year colleges, 20% go to 2-year colleges, 19% find employment, and 7% are searching for a job. That adds up to 100%, which is good, so I don't think there's any missing percentage here.\n\nThe question is, if a randomly selected student is not going on to a 2-year college, what's the probability that she will be going on to a 4-year college?\n\nOkay, so first, I need to find the probability that a student is going to a 4-year college, given that she is not going to a 2-year college.\n\nThis sounds like a conditional probability problem. I remember that in conditional probability, we have P(A|B), which is the probability of event A given that event B has occurred.\n\nIn this case, event A is going to a 4-year college, and event B is not going to a 2-year college.\n\nThe formula for conditional probability is:\n\nP(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\n\nBut wait, P(A and B) is the probability of both A and B happening. But in this scenario, if a student is not going to a 2-year college, and I'm also asking that they go to a 4-year college, that might be slightly confusing.\n\nLet me think differently. The total percentage of students is 100%, divided into:\n\n- 54% to 4-year colleges\n\n- 20% to 2-year colleges\n\n- 19% employed\n\n- 7% searching for a job\n\nSo, if a student is not going to a 2-year college, that means we're excluding the 20% who are going to 2-year colleges. So, the total percentage of students who are not going to 2-year colleges is 100% - 20% = 80%.\n\nNow, within this 80% of students, what percentage is going to 4-year colleges?\n\nWell, out of the total 100%, 54% are going to 4-year colleges. So, if we have 80% of students who are not going to 2-year colleges, the proportion going to 4-year colleges within this group would be the same as their overall proportion, but adjusted for the new total.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the probability directly using the conditional probability formula.\n\nSo, P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\n\nHere, A is \"going to a 4-year college,\" and B is \"not going to a 2-year college.\"\n\nSo, P(A and B) is the probability of going to a 4-year college and not going to a 2-year college. But going to a 4-year college implies not going to a 2-year college, since it's a different pathway. So, P(A and B) is just P(A), which is 54%.\n\nAnd P(B) is the probability of not going to a 2-year college, which is 100% - 20% = 80%.\n\nSo, P(A|B) = 54% / 80% = 54/80 = 0.675, or 67.5%.\n\nBut let me double-check this reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of the total probability theorem or just basic probability principles.\n\nLet me list out all the possible outcomes and their probabilities:\n\n- Go to 4-year college: 54%\n\n- Go to 2-year college: 20%\n\n- Find employment: 19%\n\n- Search for a job: 7%\n\nTotal: 100%\n\nNow, if we exclude the students who go to 2-year colleges (20%), we're left with 54% + 19% + 7% = 80% of students.\n\nWithin this 80%, the proportion going to 4-year colleges is still 54%, but relative to the new total, it's (54%)/(80%).\n\nWait, no. The proportion within the group not going to 2-year colleges is indeed (54%)/(80%).\n\nSo, performing the division: 54 divided by 80 is indeed 0.675, or 67.5%.\n\nThat seems consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nLet me consider another approach to confirm.\n\nSuppose there are 100 graduates.\n\n- 54 go to 4-year colleges\n\n- 20 go to 2-year colleges\n\n- 19 find employment\n\n- 7 are searching for a job\n\nSo, out of 100, 80 do not go to 2-year colleges (54 + 19 + 7).\n\nOut of these 80, 54 go to 4-year colleges.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a student is going to a 4-year college, given that she is not going to a 2-year college, is 54/80, which simplifies to 0.675, or 67.5%.\n\nThis matches my previous calculation, so I feel confident about this answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use percentages directly:\n\nP(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B) = P(A) / P(B) = (54%) / (80%) = 0.675\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this probability. For example, is there any overlap between the categories that I might have missed? From the problem, it seems that the categories are mutually exclusive: a student can only fall into one of these four categories.\n\nTherefore, there shouldn't be any overlapping issues.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use Bayes' theorem, but I think that's overkill here since the events are straightforward and mutually exclusive.\n\nSo, my final answer is 0.675, which corresponds to option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
