                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which type of training technique the piano teacher is using with her student. The options are negative reinforcement, negative punishment, shaping, and chaining. Let me think about each one.\n\nFirst, negative reinforcement is when you remove an unpleasant stimulus to encourage a behavior. Like, if a kid doesn't want to do chores, but if they do them, you take away their homework for the day or something. Wait, that might not be the best example. Maybe if a dog barks to get attention, and you ignore it until it stops barking, then give it a treat, that's negative reinforcement\u2014removing the ignore (unpleasant for the dog) when it stops barking.\n\nNegative punishment is the opposite; it's removing a pleasant stimulus to discourage a behavior. So, if a kid doesn't do their homework, you take away their video game time. Or with a dog, if it jumps on people, you might take away its favorite toy.\n\nShaping is when you reinforce small steps toward a final behavior. Like, if you want to teach a dog to roll over, you might first reward it for lying down, then for rolling onto its side, and so on, until it can do the whole roll over command.\n\nChaining is when you link multiple behaviors together to achieve a complex task. It's like breaking down a big task into smaller steps and teaching each step one after another. For example, teaching a dog to fetch a ball: first teach it to pick up the ball, then to bring it back to you, and combine these steps.\n\nNow, in the case of the piano teacher, she starts by praising the student for playing correct notes. That's like reinforcing the basic skill. Then, as the student gets better at that, she only praises when the student adds proper dynamics and interpretation. So, it seems like she's raising the bar as the student improves.\n\nThis sounds a lot like shaping because she's reinforcing closer and closer approximations to the final performance she wants. Initially, just playing the right notes is good, but then she expects more, like expression and dynamics.\n\nLet me see if it fits with the other options.\n\nNegative reinforcement: Is she removing something unpleasant to get the student to play better? Not really. She's giving praise, which is positive.\n\nNegative punishment: Is she taking away something pleasant to discourage bad playing? No, she's not taking anything away; she's adding praise.\n\nChaining: Is she linking multiple behaviors together? Maybe, but it seems more about refining the performance rather than linking discrete steps.\n\nShaping seems the most appropriate choice here. The teacher is gradually increasing her expectations as the student improves, reinforcing the behavior that comes closer to the ideal performance.\n\nI think the answer is C. Shaping.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
