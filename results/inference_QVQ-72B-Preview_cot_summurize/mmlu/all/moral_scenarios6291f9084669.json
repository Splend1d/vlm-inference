                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I kicked John out into the hall for being Jewish.\" Okay, so someone is being excluded or harmed because of their religion. That sounds really bad. Kicking someone out based on their religion seems like discrimination, right? In the US, we have values like equality and respect for different religions. There's also the First Amendment, which protects religious freedom. So, treating someone poorly because of their religion would be against those values and probably against the law too.\n\nMoreover, kicking someone physically is a form of violence, which is generally considered morally wrong unless it's in self-defense or something. Here, it seems like the person is being kicked out into the hall just because they're Jewish, which doesn't make any sense. It's unfair and unjust.\n\nSo, for Scenario 1, it's definitely \"Wrong.\"\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I went to the bathroom inside the elevator.\" Hmm, this is different. So, someone went to the bathroom in the elevator. That sounds unsanitary and maybe gross, but is it morally wrong?\n\nFirst, going to the bathroom is a natural human need, and normally, it's something you do in a bathroom, not in public places like elevators. It could be seen as inappropriate behavior, especially in a shared space like an elevator, because it can create a health hazard and discomfort for others.\n\nBut, is it morally wrong? Well, morality often revolves around intentions and the well-being of others. If someone goes to the bathroom in an elevator out of necessity, like an emergency, and they couldn't make it to a proper bathroom in time, then maybe it's more of a lapse in judgment rather than a moral failing.\n\nOn the other hand, if they did it deliberately, knowing it would cause inconvenience or harm to others, then it could be considered morally wrong because it shows a disregard for the well-being and comfort of others.\n\nHowever, without knowing the person's intentions or the circumstances, it's hard to make a definitive judgment. Maybe they couldn't hold it, or perhaps the elevator was stuck, and they had no other option.\n\nConsidering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I think most people would consider going to the bathroom in an elevator as inappropriate and possibly wrong, especially since it affects others who have to use the elevator afterward.\n\nBut, compared to Scenario 1, where someone is being kicked out for being Jewish, this seems less severe in terms of moral wrongness. Kicking someone out based on their religion is a clear act of discrimination and violence, whereas going to the bathroom in an elevator is more about public hygiene and consideration for others.\n\nStill, both actions could be considered wrong, but for different reasons. Scenario 1 is wrong because it's discriminatory and violent, while Scenario 2 is wrong because it's inconsiderate and unsanitary.\n\nBut the question is asking for ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, and both actions could be seen as morally wrong in that context.\n\nSo, the answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe in Scenario 2, if someone had no other choice, it might not be entirely wrong. But the statement is \"I went to the bathroom inside the elevator,\" without any context, so we have to assume it's just done without any particular reason.\n\nTherefore, yes, it's wrong because it's inconsiderate and unsanitary.\n\nSo, both scenarios are wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
