                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 47-year-old man who's been admitted to the emergency department with some pretty concerning symptoms. He's been experiencing palpitations, left-sided chest pain, light-headedness, and shortness of breath that started while he was watching TV about two hours ago. His medical history mentions paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which is a type of irregular heartbeat that can come and go. He's quite tall, 180 cm, and weighs 82 kg, with a BMI of 25 kg/m2, which is considered normal.\n\nWhen he arrived at the emergency department, his ECG showed atrial fibrillation with narrow QRS complexes, which suggests that the electrical activity in his heart is irregular but the main pumping chambers are still coordinating properly. His pulse was really high at 146 beats per minute. During the physical exam, they noted that he had a rapid heart rate, which makes sense given the atrial fibrillation and the high pulse.\n\nThey gave him oxygen through a nasal cannula and intravenous metoprolol, starting with 5 mg every five minutes, up to a total of 15 mg. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that helps slow the heart rate and reduce the workload on the heart. After this treatment, his pulse slowed down to 90 beats per minute, which is within the normal range. However, two hours after admission, he's now pain-free, which is good, but his pulse has jumped back up to 160 beats per minute. His blood pressure is 122/78 mm Hg, which is still within normal limits.\n\nThe question is asking which medication should be administered intravenously to decrease his pulse. Let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand why his pulse is back up to 160 beats per minute. Given that he has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, it's possible that the atrial fibrillation has recurred, leading to another episode of rapid heart rate. The fact that his pulse was controlled initially with metoprolol but has since increased again suggests that the underlying arrhythmia might still be active or has returned.\n\nLet's consider the options provided:\n\nA. Digoxin\n\nB. Enalapril\n\nC. Lidocaine\n\nD. Metoprolol\n\nI need to evaluate which of these medications is most appropriate for managing his current situation.\n\nStarting with digoxin (option A), it's a medication commonly used to treat heart failure and arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation. It works by slowing the heart rate and improving heart function. In the context of atrial fibrillation, digoxin can help control the heart rate by slowing down the electrical impulses through the atrioventricular (AV) node. It's often used intravenously in acute settings to manage rapid heart rates associated with atrial fibrillation.\n\nNext, enalapril (option B) is an ACE inhibitor, primarily used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. It works by relaxing blood vessels and improving heart function. While it can be beneficial in certain cardiac conditions, it's not typically used acutely in the emergency department for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Moreover, the patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, so there may not be an immediate need for an ACE inhibitor in this scenario.\n\nLidocaine (option C) is a local anesthetic and class IB antiarrhythmic agent. It's primarily used for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. In the context of atrial fibrillation, lidocaine isn't usually the first choice for rate control because it doesn't effectively slow the heart rate in supraventricular arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation.\n\nLastly, metoprolol (option D) is a beta-blocker that's commonly used for rate control in atrial fibrillation. It works by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors, which helps to slow the heart rate and reduce the force of heart contractions. It's effective in managing the heart rate during episodes of atrial fibrillation and is often used both acutely and chronically for this purpose.\n\nGiven the patient's history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and the recent episode of rapid heart rate, which was temporarily controlled with metoprolol but has since increased again, it's likely that the atrial fibrillation is persisting or has recurred. Therefore, administering another dose of metoprolol could be a reasonable next step to control the heart rate.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the patient has developed tolerance to the initial dose of metoprolol or that a higher dose is needed for better rate control. Alternatively, digoxin could be considered as an additional agent for rate control, especially if metoprolol alone isn't sufficient.\n\nBut in this particular scenario, the patient has already received intravenous metoprolol with initial success, and his pulse has since increased again. This suggests that the effect of metoprolol may be wearing off or that a higher dose is needed. Therefore, administering another dose of metoprolol intravenously could be an appropriate next step to manage his heart rate.\n\nIt's also important to consider the patient's blood pressure. Since his blood pressure is within normal limits (122/78 mm Hg), using a medication that might further lower blood pressure, such as an ACE inhibitor like enalapril, isn't necessary at this time. Lidocaine isn't indicated for rate control in atrial fibrillation, and digoxin, while a viable option, might not be the first choice if metoprolol has already shown some efficacy.\n\nIn summary, given the patient's condition and the medications already administered, the most appropriate next step would be to administer another dose of metoprolol intravenously to control his heart rate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
