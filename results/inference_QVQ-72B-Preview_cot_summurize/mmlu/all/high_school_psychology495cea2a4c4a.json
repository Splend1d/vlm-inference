It is a key event in puberty and signifies that a girl's body is maturing and becoming capable of reproduction. Typically, menarche occurs between the ages of 10 and 16, with an average age of around 12 years in many populations.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that menarche is a female-specific event and does not occur in males. Puberty in males involves different changes and milestones, such as the onset of spermarche, which is the first ejaculation of semen, usually occurring around the age of 13, but this can vary widely.\n\nTherefore, among the given options:\n\nA. 12 in males only\n\nB. 12 in females only\n\nC. 12 in both sexes\n\nD. 12 in females and 14 in males\n\nThe correct choice is B. 12 in females only.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure there's no confusion. Menarche is indeed a female reproductive milestone, marking the beginning of their menstrual cycles. It's not something that occurs in males. While both sexes experience puberty and related changes, the specific events differ based on biological sex.\n\nSo, option B seems to be the most accurate answer.\n\nWait a minute, option D mentions that menarche occurs at 12 in females and 14 in males. But as I've stated, menarche is a female phenomenon and doesn't occur in males. Therefore, option D is incorrect because it incorrectly attributes menarche to both sexes with different ages.\n\nOption C suggests that menarche occurs at age 12 in both sexes, which is also incorrect for the same reason that menarche is only experienced by females.\n\nOption A states that menarche occurs at age 12 in males only, which is contrary to fact since menarche is a female reproductive event.\n\nHence, the only correct option is B. 12 in females only.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility of menarche occurring in males due to some rare conditions. However, I don't believe that's the case. Menarche is uniquely associated with the female reproductive system and the menstrual cycle.\n\nIn summary, menarche typically occurs around age 12 in females, and it's not observed in males. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 12 in females only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
