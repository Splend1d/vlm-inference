I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that Mahavira is a name associated with Jainism. He's considered the 24th Tirthankara, or spiritual teacher, in Jain tradition. So, understanding the meaning of his name seems important.\n\nLet me break it down. \"Maha\" is a Sanskrit prefix that means \"great\" or \"large\". For example, in English, we have words like \"maharaja\" which means \"great king\". So, \"maha\" suggests something significant or of high importance.\n\nNow, \"vira\" needs a bit more thought. I recall that \"vira\" in Sanskrit can mean \"hero\", \"warrior\", or \"brave person\". So, combining \"maha\" and \"vira\", it should be \"great hero\" or \"supreme hero\".\n\nLooking at the options again, A. \"Great Hero\" seems to align with this interpretation. Option B. \"Master\" could be a possible translation, but it doesn't capture the full connotation of \"great hero\". Option C. \"The Lesser One\" definitely doesn't fit, as \"maha\" implies greatness, not smallness. Option D. \"Mendicant\" refers to a beggar or someone who lives on alms, which might relate to Mahavira's lifestyle after renouncing worldly possessions, but it doesn't directly translate from his name.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, I think the correct answer is A. \"Great Hero\". But just to be thorough, I should check some reliable sources to confirm.\n\nI did a quick search and found that Mahavira is indeed translated as \"Great Hero\" in various Jain texts and scholarly works. It's a title that reflects his courageous spiritual journey and his attainment of enlightenment.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is A. \"Great Hero\".\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ \"Great Hero\"}} \\]"
