                    "text": "So I need to figure out which list of policies will close an inflationary gap. First off, I should probably understand what an inflationary gap is. From what I remember in economics class, an inflationary gap occurs when the actual GDP exceeds the potential GDP. That means the economy is producing more than its long-term capacity, which can lead to inflation.\n\nSo, to close this gap, we need to bring the actual GDP back down to the potential GDP. That probably means slowing down economic growth, reducing aggregate demand, or both.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Increase the money supply; run a federal budget deficit.\n\nFirst, increasing the money supply. I think that when you increase the money supply, it's like pumping more money into the economy. That should stimulate spending because there's more money around, making it easier for people and businesses to borrow and spend. But wait, if we're trying to close an inflationary gap, we want to reduce spending, not increase it. So, increasing the money supply seems counterintuitive here.\n\nNext, running a federal budget deficit. A budget deficit means the government is spending more than it's taking in through taxes. Typically, to fund this deficit, the government borrows money, which can lead to increased interest rates and potentially crowd out private investment. However, in terms of aggregate demand, running a deficit increases government spending, which is a component of aggregate demand. So, again, this would likely increase overall demand in the economy, which is the opposite of what we want to do to close an inflationary gap.\n\nTherefore, option A doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B: Decrease the money supply; run a federal budget deficit.\n\nDecreasing the money supply sounds better. If we reduce the money supply, it becomes harder for people and businesses to borrow money, which should lead to decreased spending and investment. This should help reduce aggregate demand and cool down the economy, which is what we need to close an inflationary gap.\n\nBut again, running a federal budget deficit would increase government spending, which would offset some of the decreases from the money supply reduction. So, if we're decreasing the money supply and increasing government spending, these actions might cancel each other out, meaning they wouldn't effectively close the inflationary gap.\n\nSo, option B isn't the best choice either.\n\nOption C: Decrease the money supply; increase taxes; reduce government spending.\n\nThis seems more promising. Decreasing the money supply, as I said earlier, should reduce spending and investment. Increasing taxes would also reduce consumers' disposable income, leading them to spend less. Additionally, reducing government spending directly decreases aggregate demand.\n\nSo, all three policies in option C are aimed at reducing aggregate demand, which is exactly what we need to close an inflationary gap.\n\nOption D: Increase the money supply; increase taxes; reduce government spending.\n\nHere, increasing the money supply would stimulate spending, while increasing taxes and reducing government spending would decrease spending. So, these policies are working against each other. It's likely that the increase in the money supply would lead to more spending, which might not help close the inflationary gap, especially if the tax increases and spending cuts aren't large enough to offset it.\n\nTherefore, option D is probably not the best choice.\n\nAfter considering all the options, option C seems to be the one that consistently applies policies to reduce aggregate demand, which is necessary to close an inflationary gap.\n\nJust to make sure, let me recap:\n\n- Decreasing the money supply reduces spending and investment.\n\n- Increasing taxes reduces consumer spending.\n\n- Reducing government spending directly reduces aggregate demand.\n\nAll these measures are contractionary policies, meaning they reduce aggregate demand and help bring the economy back to its potential GDP.\n\nSo, the answer should be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
