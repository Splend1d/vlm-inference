                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: I need to find the equation of the tangent line to the graph of \\( y = x + e^x \\) at \\( x = 0 \\). The options are A. \\( y = 2x + 1 \\), B. \\( y = 2x \\), C. \\( y = x + 2 \\), and D. \\( y = x + 1 \\).\n\nFirst, I need to remember how to find the equation of a tangent line to a curve at a given point. I know that the general equation of a straight line is \\( y = mx + b \\), where \\( m \\) is the slope and \\( b \\) is the y-intercept. So, if I can find the slope of the tangent line at \\( x = 0 \\) and the point where it touches the curve, I can find the equation.\n\nTo find the slope of the tangent line at a particular point, I need to find the derivative of the function and evaluate it at that point. So, let's find the derivative of \\( y = x + e^x \\).\n\nThe derivative of \\( x \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is \\( 1 \\), and the derivative of \\( e^x \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is \\( e^x \\). So, the derivative \\( y' = 1 + e^x \\).\n\nNow, I need to evaluate \\( y' \\) at \\( x = 0 \\). Plugging in \\( x = 0 \\) into \\( y' \\), I get \\( y'(0) = 1 + e^0 = 1 + 1 = 2 \\). So, the slope \\( m \\) of the tangent line at \\( x = 0 \\) is 2.\n\nNext, I need to find the point on the curve where \\( x = 0 \\). Plugging \\( x = 0 \\) into the original function \\( y = x + e^x \\), I get \\( y = 0 + e^0 = 0 + 1 = 1 \\). So, the point is \\( (0, 1) \\).\n\nNow that I have the slope \\( m = 2 \\) and the point \\( (0, 1) \\), I can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which is \\( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\).\n\nPlugging in the values, I get \\( y - 1 = 2(x - 0) \\), which simplifies to \\( y = 2x + 1 \\).\n\nLooking back at the options, A. \\( y = 2x + 1 \\), B. \\( y = 2x \\), C. \\( y = x + 2 \\), and D. \\( y = x + 1 \\), it seems like option A matches the equation I just derived.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could use the formula for the tangent line to a function at a point \\( a \\), which is \\( y = f'(a)(x - a) + f(a) \\).\n\nGiven that, for \\( a = 0 \\), \\( f(0) = 1 \\), and \\( f'(0) = 2 \\), plugging into the formula gives \\( y = 2(x - 0) + 1 = 2x + 1 \\), which confirms my previous result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the general form of the tangent line equation and see which one fits.\n\nBut I think I'm confident with my answer. The slope is 2, and the y-intercept is 1, so the equation is \\( y = 2x + 1 \\), which corresponds to option A.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider why the other options might be wrong.\n\nOption B is \\( y = 2x \\). This has the correct slope of 2, but it doesn't have the y-intercept of 1. It passes through the origin, whereas the tangent line should pass through \\( (0,1) \\).\n\nOption C is \\( y = x + 2 \\). This has a slope of 1, which doesn't match the derivative value of 2 at \\( x = 0 \\).\n\nOption D is \\( y = x + 1 \\). This has a slope of 1, again not matching the derivative value, and it passes through \\( (0,1) \\), but with the wrong slope.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is indeed A. \\( y = 2x + 1 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ y = 2x + 1} \\]"
