                    "text": "So I've got this property law problem here, and I need to figure out the best argument for the son who's being sued by his neighbor, the geologist, for starting a home business selling imported wine. The geologist is trying to eject the son from his lot based on some covenants and restrictions attached to the property.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the background. There's a housing corporation that owns a tract of land and divides it into 100 lots for a residential community. They create a Declaration of Covenants to manage and enforce rules for this community. One of these covenants says that no part of the property can be used for a saloon or place to sell or manufacture alcoholic liquors.\n\nThe psychologist buys lot 24, and his deed includes this Declaration of Covenants. Then, he gives lot 24 to his son, but the son's deed doesn't mention the Declaration of Covenants or its provisions. Instead, it says the property is conveyed to the son \"as long as they are used for residential purposes only.\" The son doesn't record his deed, and he starts selling imported wine from his home. The geologist, who owns lot 26 next to the son's lot, sues the son for ejectment.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the options given as potential arguments for the son:\n\nA. The deed to the son created a fee simple determinable with a possibility of reverter, giving the psychologist, but not the geologist, the right to sue the son.\n\nB. Not having been recorded, the condition cannot be enforced against the son.\n\nC. The geologist is entitled only to an injunction against the son.\n\nD. The law prohibits a fee simple determinable.\n\nLet me try to understand each option.\n\nStarting with option A: It says that the deed created a fee simple determinable with a possibility of reverter, and only the psychologist can sue, not the geologist.\n\nFirst, what's a fee simple determinable? It's a type of fee simple estate that lasts until a specified condition occurs, at which point the estate automatically terminates and reverts to the grantor or their heirs. The condition here is that the property must be used for residential purposes only. So, if the son uses the property for non-residential purposes, like selling wine, the estate should revert back to the psychologist or his heirs.\n\nBut the problem is that the psychologist gave the property to his son, and the son is the current owner. The geologist is a neighboring landowner, not the original grantor. So, according to this argument, only the psychologist, as the grantor, has the right to enforce the condition and seek to eject the son if the condition is violated. The geologist, being a third party, doesn't have standing to enforce this particular covenant.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if this is the best argument. Maybe the geologist has other grounds to enforce the covenant.\n\nOption B says that because the son's deed wasn't recorded, the condition cannot be enforced against him.\n\nIn property law, recording a deed is important for notice to third parties. Generally, a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of prior claims can take free of those claims if they record their deed first. But in this case, the son didn't record his deed, and the psychologist's deed included the Declaration of Covenants, which was recorded.\n\nWait, the psychologist's deed included the Declaration of Covenants, which was recorded. So, even if the son's deed doesn't mention it, the covenants are part of the property's record title. Covenants in a declaration are typically binding on subsequent owners, even if their deeds don't specifically reference the declaration, as long as the declaration is recorded and properly indexed.\n\nSo, this argument might not hold up because the covenants are part of the public record, and the son is bound by them whether his deed mentions them or not.\n\nOption C: The geologist is entitled only to an injunction against the son.\n\nAn injunction is a equitable remedy that can be used to prevent someone from doing something or to require them to do something. In this case, the geologist might seek an injunction to stop the son from selling wine from his home, arguing that it violates the covenant against using the property for a saloon or place to sell liquor.\n\nHowever, ejectment is a legal remedy seeking to remove someone from possession of the land. The geologist is bringing an action of ejectment, which suggests they want the son removed from the property, not just stopped from selling wine.\n\nBut maybe the geologist can only get an injunction to stop the wine-selling activity, not to eject the son from the property. This could be a possible argument for the son\u2014that the geologist can't seek ejectment based on this covenant violation.\n\nHowever, in many jurisdictions, if a covenant is violated in a way that affects the character of the neighborhood or the value of adjacent properties, a neighboring landowner might have standing to seek ejectment or other remedies to enforce the covenant.\n\nI need to think about whether the geologist has the right to seek ejectment based on the covenant violation.\n\nOption D: The law prohibits a fee simple determinable.\n\nThis seems straightforward. Some jurisdictions don't allow fee simple determinable estates because they can create uncertainties in land ownership. Instead, they might require that conditions be enforced through covenants or other means.\n\nIf this is the case, then the condition in the son's deed\u2014\"as long as they are used for residential purposes only\"\u2014might not create a fee simple determinable but rather a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, which would require the grantor to take affirmative action to enforce the condition.\n\nBut even if the law prohibits fee simple determinable estates, the covenant in the Declaration of Covenants still stands as a restriction on the use of the property.\n\nSo, this argument might not be the strongest because even if the fee simple determinable isn't enforceable, the covenant in the declaration is still binding on the property.\n\nNow, considering all this, which option is the best argument for the son?\n\nOption A suggests that only the psychologist can enforce the condition through ejectment, not the geologist. This might be a strong argument if the covenant is personal to the grantor and not enforceable by subsequent owners or neighbors.\n\nOption B seems weak because the covenants are recorded and part of the public record, so the son is likely bound by them regardless of whether his deed mentions them.\n\nOption C suggests that the geologist can only get an injunction, not ejectment. But depending on the jurisdiction, a neighboring landowner might have the right to seek ejectment for covenant violations that affect their property.\n\nOption D claims that fee simple determinable is prohibited by law, but even if that's true, it doesn't necessarily help the son because the covenant in the declaration is still enforceable.\n\nBetween these options, option A seems like the strongest argument for the son. If the covenant is part of a fee simple determinable created by the psychologist in the son's deed, and the right to enforce it lies only with the psychologist or his heirs, then the geologist, as a neighboring landowner, might not have the standing to enforce it through ejectment.\n\nHowever, I should consider that the Declaration of Covenants might have provisions allowing neighboring landowners to enforce the covenants. If that's the case, then the geologist might have the right to bring an action for ejectment.\n\nBut based on the information given, the Declaration of Covenants was created by the housing corporation to manage the residential community, and it includes restrictions like no saloons or places to sell liquor.\n\nSo, perhaps the geologist has standing to enforce these covenants against the son.\n\nBut according to option A, the specific condition in the son's deed creates a fee simple determinable, and only the grantor (the psychologist) can enforce it.\n\nThis seems contradictory. Maybe both the psychologist and the geologist have rights to enforce the covenant, but through different remedies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the covenant in the declaration is a reciprocal covenant binding all lot owners, and any lot owner can enforce it against any other lot owner.\n\nIn that case, the geologist might have the right to enforce the covenant against the son, even if the son's deed contains a different condition.\n\nThis complicates things. Maybe the condition in the son's deed is superseded by the covenant in the declaration.\n\nIf that's the case, then the geologist can enforce the declaration's covenant against the son, regardless of what's in the son's deed.\n\nBut then, what's the nature of the estate the son holds? If his deed says \"as long as they are used for residential purposes only,\" that sounds like a fee simple determinable with a condition that the property must be used for residential purposes.\n\nBut the declaration has a different covenant that restricts specific uses related to alcohol.\n\nSo, perhaps both restrictions apply to the son's property.\n\nIn that case, the son is bound by both the condition in his deed and the covenant in the declaration.\n\nIf that's the case, then the geologist might have the right to enforce the declaration's covenant against the son.\n\nBut then, what about the psychologist's right under the fee simple determinable in the son's deed?\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the best argument for the son is that the geologist doesn't have standing to enforce the covenant through ejectment, and only the psychologist, as the grantor of the fee simple determinable, has that right.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the son can argue that the covenant in the declaration doesn't apply to him because his deed doesn't mention it, and he didn't record his deed.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, recorded covenants generally bind subsequent owners even if their deeds don't specifically reference them, as long as the covenants are properly recorded.\n\nSo, that argument seems weak.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the son can argue that the covenant is unenforceable because it's too vague or because it's against public policy to restrict the sale of wine.\n\nBut that seems like a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the son can argue that selling imported wine from home isn't the same as operating a saloon or place for the sale of liquor, so he's not violating the covenant.\n\nBut that might not hold up, as selling wine could be considered a commercial activity related to liquor sales, which the covenant aims to prevent.\n\nWait, the covenant says \"no structure designed for or used as a saloon or place for the sale or manufacture of malt, vinous, or spirituous liquors.\"\n\nSelling imported wine from home might not involve a structure designed for that purpose, especially if it's just a home business without any modifications to the property.\n\nSo, perhaps there's an argument there that the son isn't violating the covenant because he's not using a structure designed for selling liquor; he's just selling wine from his home.\n\nBut that might be a weak argument, as the activity itself could be considered a violation of the covenant's intent.\n\nStill, it's something to consider.\n\nBut going back to the options provided, option A seems like the strongest argument for the son: that only the psychologist, as the grantor of the fee simple determinable, has the right to enforce the condition through ejectment, and the geologist, as a neighboring landowner, doesn't have standing to do so.\n\nHowever, I have some doubts because the declaration is a reciprocal covenant that likely allows any lot owner to enforce its provisions against other lot owners.\n\nIf that's the case, then the geologist might have the right to enforce the covenant against the son.\n\nBut perhaps the son can argue that the declaration's covenant is separate from the condition in his deed, and that the geologist can only enforce the declaration's covenant, not the condition in the son's deed.\n\nBut if the declaration's covenant includes the restriction against saloons and liquor sales, then the geologist can enforce that against the son.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should look at it differently.\n\nSuppose that the declaration's covenant runs with the land and binds all subsequent owners, and any lot owner can enforce it against any other lot owner.\n\nIn that case, the geologist has the right to enforce the covenant against the son.\n\nBut the son's deed has a different condition: \"as long as they are used for residential purposes only.\"\n\nSo, does the son have to comply with both the declaration's covenant and the condition in his deed?\n\nIf so, then the son is violating both by selling wine from home, which is not purely residential use and also potentially violates the covenant against liquor sales.\n\nIn that scenario, the geologist can enforce the declaration's covenant against the son.\n\nTherefore, option A might not be the best argument because it assumes that only the psychologist can enforce the condition, but the declaration's covenant is separate and enforceable by any lot owner.\n\nOption B is weak because the covenants are recorded and bind subsequent owners regardless of whether their deeds mention them.\n\nOption C suggests that the geologist can only get an injunction, not ejectment. But in many jurisdictions, a neighboring landowner can seek ejectment for covenant violations that affect their property.\n\nOption D claims that fee simple determinable is prohibited by law, but even if that's true, it doesn't necessarily help the son because the covenant in the declaration still binds the property.\n\nGiven these considerations, none of the options seem like particularly strong arguments for the son.\n\nBut if I have to choose the best among them, perhaps option A is the strongest, arguing that only the psychologist can enforce the condition through ejectment.\n\nHowever, considering that the declaration's covenant is likely enforceable by any lot owner, this argument might not hold up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the son can argue that the geologist must first seek an injunction to stop the wine-selling activity before seeking ejectment, making option C a possible argument.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nOverall, I think the best argument for the son is option A: that only the psychologist can enforce the condition through ejectment, not the geologist.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
