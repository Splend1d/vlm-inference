                    "text": "So I have this problem here: compute the product of 12 and 16 in the ring Z_24. The options are 0, 1, 4, or 6. Hmm, I need to make sure I understand what's being asked here.\n\nFirst off, Z_24 is the set of integers modulo 24, right? So, it includes all integers from 0 to 23, and any number beyond that is considered equivalent to its remainder when divided by 24. For example, 24 is the same as 0 in Z_24, 25 is 1, and so on.\n\nNow, I need to compute the product of 12 and 16 in this ring. Normally, I'd just multiply 12 by 16, which is 192, and then take that modulo 24. So, I need to find 192 mod 24.\n\nLet me calculate that. To find 192 mod 24, I can divide 192 by 24 and see what the remainder is. 24 times 8 is 192, so 192 divided by 24 is exactly 8, with no remainder. That means 192 mod 24 is 0.\n\nWait a minute, that would mean the answer is 0, but let me double-check if there's another way to look at this. Maybe I can simplify before taking the modulo. For example, both 12 and 16 are divisible by 4, so 12 times 16 is the same as 3 times 4 times 16, which is 3 times 64. Then, 3 times 64 is 192, and again, 192 mod 24 is 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use properties of modular arithmetic to simplify the multiplication. I know that (a * b) mod n is the same as [(a mod n) * (b mod n)] mod n. So, 12 mod 24 is 12, and 16 mod 24 is 16, so (12 * 16) mod 24 is indeed 192 mod 24, which is 0.\n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe by factoring or using some properties of Z_24. Let's see, 24 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. But I'm not sure if that helps directly here.\n\nWait, another thought: since 12 and 16 are both multiples of 4, their product is a multiple of 16 (since 12*16=192, which is 16*12). But again, that just confirms that 192 is a multiple of 16, which doesn't directly help with the modulo operation.\n\nLet me consider if there's a different approach. Maybe using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since 24 is 8*3, and both are coprime. But that might be overcomplicating things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express 12 and 16 in terms of their prime factors. 12 is 2^2 * 3, and 16 is 2^4. So, their product is 2^6 * 3. Now, 2^6 is 64, and 3 is 3, so 64 * 3 = 192. Again, back to where I started.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the exponents modulo the order of the group. But in Z_24, we're dealing with addition and multiplication modulo 24, and since 24 isn't a prime, Z_24 isn't a field, but that doesn't affect multiplication directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look at the units of Z_24, but again, that might not be necessary for this specific problem.\n\nLet me try another angle. Since 12 and 16 are both even numbers, their product is divisible by 4. Also, 12 is divisible by 4, and 16 is divisible by 4, so their product is divisible by 16. But again, that doesn't directly help with finding the modulo 24 result.\n\nMaybe I can think about the greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 12 and 24 is 12, and the GCD of 16 and 24 is 8. But I'm not sure how that relates to the product.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that 24 is divisible by 12 and 16, but that's not accurate since 24 divided by 12 is 2, and 24 divided by 16 is 1.5, which isn't an integer.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the property that if a number is divisible by another number, then its modulo will be zero. For example, since 24 is divisible by 12, 24 mod 12 is 0. But in this case, 192 is divisible by 24, because 24 times 8 is 192, so 192 mod 24 is 0.\n\nSo, it seems consistent that the answer should be 0.\n\nBut let me check if there's any trick here. Maybe the question is testing whether I remember to take the modulo after multiplication. Or perhaps there's a different interpretation of the ring Z_24 that I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing my understanding of modular arithmetic in rings. But I think I have a grasp of that.\n\nLet me consider if there's a different approach using properties of rings. In Z_24, multiplication is associative and commutative, and there's an additive identity. But again, that might not be necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the multiplicative inverses, but since 12 and 16 are not units in Z_24 (their GCD with 24 isn't 1), that might not help.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the fact that 12 is congruent to -12 mod 24, and 16 is congruent to -8 mod 24. So, (12)(16) is the same as (-12)(-8), which is 96, and 96 mod 24 is also 0.\n\nThat's another way to confirm the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that 12 is congruent to 12 mod 24, and 16 is congruent to 16 mod 24, so their product is 192 mod 24, which is 0.\n\nIt seems like no matter how I approach it, I end up with 0 as the result.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if there's a mistake in my calculations. Let me double-check the multiplication: 12 times 16.\n\n12 times 10 is 120, and 12 times 6 is 72, so 120 + 72 = 192. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, dividing 192 by 24: 24 times 8 is 192, so the remainder is 0. Yes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, 192 divided by 24 is 8, with no remainder. So, 192 mod 24 is indeed 0.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 0.\n\nBut let's see if there's any possibility of misinterpretation in the question. The problem says \"compute the product in the given ring. (12)(16) in Z_24\". It's straightforward: multiply 12 and 16, then take the result modulo 24.\n\nSo, unless there's some trick I'm missing, the answer should be 0.\n\nLet me consider if perhaps the options provided are incorrect or if there's a different context to the question. But based on standard modular arithmetic, 12 times 16 in Z_24 is 0.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
