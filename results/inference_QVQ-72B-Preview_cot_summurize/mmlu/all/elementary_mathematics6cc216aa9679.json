                    "text": "So I have this equation: x + 2.7 = 8.4. I need to find out what x is. Let me think about how to solve this. I remember that to find x, I should isolate it on one side of the equation. So, if I subtract 2.7 from both sides, that should do it.\n\nLet me try that. Starting with x + 2.7 = 8.4, I'll subtract 2.7 from both sides:\n\nx + 2.7 - 2.7 = 8.4 - 2.7\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\nx = 8.4 - 2.7\n\nNow, I need to subtract 2.7 from 8.4. Let's see, 8.4 minus 2.7. Well, 8.4 minus 2 is 6.4, and then subtracting another 0.7 would bring it down to 5.7. So, x should be 5.7.\n\nLet me double-check that. Maybe I can use a different approach to confirm. How about if I add 2.7 to both sides instead? If I add 2.7 to x, it should equal 8.4, right? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, if I add 2.7 to both sides, I get:\n\nx + 2.7 + 2.7 = 8.4 + 2.7\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx + 5.4 = 11.1\n\nThen, subtracting 5.4 from both sides would give me x = 11.1 - 5.4, which is 5.7 again. So, that confirms my previous result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the options provided to see which one fits the equation. The options are:\n\nA. 11.1\n\nB. 5.7\n\nC. 3.7\n\nD. 22.68\n\nIf I plug in each option for x and see which one makes the equation true, that would work too.\n\nLet's try option A: x = 11.1\n\n11.1 + 2.7 = 13.8, but the equation is supposed to equal 8.4. So, 13.8 \u2260 8.4, which means A is incorrect.\n\nNext, option B: x = 5.7\n\n5.7 + 2.7 = 8.4, which matches the right side of the equation. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption C: x = 3.7\n\n3.7 + 2.7 = 6.4, which is not equal to 8.4. So, C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: x = 22.68\n\n22.68 + 2.7 = 25.38, which is not equal to 8.4. So, D is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B, 5.7.\n\nWait a minute, I got x = 5.7 from solving the equation and also by plugging in the options. But let me make sure there's no other way to interpret the equation. The equation is straightforward: x + 2.7 = 8.4. There are no other variables or complexities here. So, I'm confident that x = 5.7 is the correct solution.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about decimal addition again. Sometimes, decimals can be tricky, but in this case, it's a simple addition problem. Adding 2.7 to x gives 8.4, so subtracting 2.7 from 8.4 gives x.\n\nLet me consider the place values: 8.4 is eight units and four tenths. Subtracting 2.7, which is two units and seven tenths, from 8.4:\n\nUnits: 8 - 2 = 6\n\nTenths: 4 - 7 cannot be done without borrowing. So, I'll borrow one unit from the units place, which becomes 7, and the tenths place becomes 14 tenths.\n\nSo, 14 tenths minus 7 tenths is 7 tenths, and 7 units minus 2 units is 5 units. Therefore, x = 5.7.\n\nThis aligns with my earlier results. So, I'm sure that 5.7 is the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to look at it is using decimal points. Aligning the decimal points:\n\n8 . 4\n\n- 2 . 7\n\n= 5 . 7\n\nYes, that's straightforward. No confusion there.\n\nI think I've covered multiple ways to approach this problem, and all point to x = 5.7 being the correct solution. So, I'll go with option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
