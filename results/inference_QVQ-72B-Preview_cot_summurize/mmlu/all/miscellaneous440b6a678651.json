                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"When a gas turns into a liquid, the process is called...\" and there are four options: A. condensation, B. evaporation, C. deposition, D. sublimation. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I should recall what each of these terms means. Starting with condensation: I think condensation is when a substance changes from a gas to a liquid state. That sounds familiar. For example, when water vapor in the air cools down and turns into liquid water, like when dew forms on grass in the morning. So, that seems like it matches the description in the question.\n\nNow, what about evaporation? I know that evaporation is the opposite process, where a liquid turns into a gas. So, if condensation is gas to liquid, evaporation should be liquid to gas. Yeah, that makes sense. So, option B is probably not the correct answer.\n\nNext, deposition. I'm a bit fuzzy on this one. I think deposition involves changing directly from a gas to a solid without passing through the liquid state. Like when water vapor turns into frost on a cold surface. So, that's different from what the question is asking, which is gas turning into liquid. Therefore, option C is likely incorrect.\n\nLastly, sublimation. I believe sublimation is the process where a solid turns directly into a gas, skipping the liquid phase. An example I can think of is dry ice, which is solid carbon dioxide turning into gaseous carbon dioxide. So, again, this isn't gas turning into a liquid; it's solid turning into a gas. Therefore, option D is probably wrong.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I'm not mixing things up. The question is specifically about a gas turning into a liquid, which is a phase change from gas to liquid. Condensation seems to fit this description perfectly. Evaporation is the reverse process, deposition is gas to solid, and sublimation is solid to gas. So, based on this, the correct answer should be A. condensation.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that deposition could be considered as gas turning into liquid? No, because deposition is gas turning directly into solid, not into liquid. Similarly, sublimation is solid turning into gas, which is not related to gas turning into liquid.\n\nI think I've got it right. The answer is A. condensation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ condensation}} \\]"
