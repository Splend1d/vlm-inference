                    "text": "So I've got this economics problem here. It says that the equilibrium real GDP is far below full employment, and then the government lowers household taxes. I need to figure out what's the likely result of this action. The options are:\n\nA. Unemployment falls with little inflation.\n\nB. Unemployment rises with little inflation.\n\nC. Unemployment falls with rampant inflation.\n\nD. Unemployment rises with rampant inflation.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's going on here. Equilibrium real GDP is below full employment, which means that the economy is not operating at its potential. There's slack in the economy, meaning that not everyone who wants a job has one, and resources aren't being fully utilized.\n\nNow, the government decides to lower household taxes. Tax cuts typically put more money in people's pockets, which should increase their spending power. When people have more disposable income, they tend to spend more, which can stimulate demand for goods and services.\n\nIn macroeconomics, this increased demand is called an increase in aggregate demand. When aggregate demand increases while the economy has slack, meaning there are unemployed resources, it's likely that the increased demand will lead to more production and hiring, rather than to higher prices.\n\nSo, in this scenario, lowering taxes should lead to an increase in aggregate demand, which, given the existing slack, should lead to decreased unemployment as businesses hire more workers to meet the increased demand.\n\nNow, the question is about the impact on inflation. Since the economy is far below full employment, there's a lot of unused capacity. When there's a lot of slack, increases in demand are more likely to be absorbed by increased production and employment rather than by price increases.\n\nThis is because businesses have incentives to hire more workers and produce more goods to meet the demand rather than raising prices, especially when there's excess capacity in the economy.\n\nSo, in this situation, I would expect unemployment to fall due to increased demand, but with little inflation because of the substantial slack in the economy.\n\nWait a minute, let me think about this again. If the economy is far below full employment, that means there's a lot of unused resources. So, when demand increases because of the tax cut, these unused resources can be brought back into production without causing a significant rise in prices.\n\nFor example, if there are many unemployed workers, businesses can hire them at prevailing wage rates without having to raise wages significantly, which could lead to cost-push inflation.\n\nSimilarly, if factories are operating below capacity, they can increase production without having to invest in new capacity or raise prices.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the primary effect of the tax cut should be an increase in output and employment, with minimal pressure on prices.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the correct answer should be A: Unemployment falls with little inflation.\n\nLet me just double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B: Unemployment rises with little inflation. Wait, if unemployment is falling because of increased demand and hiring, this doesn't make sense. Unemployment should decrease, not increase.\n\nOption C: Unemployment falls with rampant inflation. This might happen if the economy were near full employment and any increase in demand led to significant price increases because there are no more unused resources to increase supply. But in this scenario, the economy is far below full employment, so there should be plenty of unused resources to increase supply without causing rampant inflation.\n\nOption D: Unemployment rises with rampant inflation. Again, this doesn't align with the scenario described. If anything, unemployment should decrease, and inflation should remain low due to the existing slack.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is A: Unemployment falls with little inflation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
