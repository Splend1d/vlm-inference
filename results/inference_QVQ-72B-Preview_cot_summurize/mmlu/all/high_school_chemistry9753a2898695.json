                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about solvents A and B forming an ideal solution. It says that solvent A has a vapor pressure of 345 torr at room temperature, and solvent B has a vapor pressure of 213 torr at the same temperature. I need to find the vapor pressure of a mixture where the mole fraction of A is 0.285. The options are 213 torr, 345 torr, 568 torr, and 251 torr.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what happens when two solvents form an ideal solution. I remember that in an ideal solution, the vapor pressure of each component follows Raoult's law. Raoult's law states that the vapor pressure of a component in a solution is equal to its mole fraction multiplied by its pure vapor pressure.\n\nSo, for solvent A, the vapor pressure \\(P_A\\) in the solution is given by:\n\n\\[P_A = X_A \\times P_A^{\\circ}\\]\n\nAnd for solvent B:\n\n\\[P_B = X_B \\times P_B^{\\circ}\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(X_A\\) is the mole fraction of A in the solution,\n\n- \\(P_A^{\\circ}\\) is the vapor pressure of pure A,\n\n- \\(X_B\\) is the mole fraction of B in the solution,\n\n- \\(P_B^{\\circ}\\) is the vapor pressure of pure B.\n\nThe total vapor pressure of the solution, \\(P_{\\text{total}}\\), is the sum of the partial pressures of A and B:\n\n\\[P_{\\text{total}} = P_A + P_B\\]\n\nGiven that the mole fraction of A is 0.285, I can find the mole fraction of B since the sum of mole fractions must be 1:\n\n\\[X_B = 1 - X_A = 1 - 0.285 = 0.715\\]\n\nNow, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[P_A = 0.285 \\times 345 \\text{ torr}\\]\\[P_B = 0.715 \\times 213 \\text{ torr}\\]\n\nLet me calculate these step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate \\(P_A\\):\n\n\\[P_A = 0.285 \\times 345\\]\n\nHmm, I should make sure to use the correct number of significant figures. The vapor pressures are given to three significant figures, and the mole fraction is given to three decimal places, which suggests that I should carry my calculations to at least three significant figures.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[P_A = 0.285 \\times 345 = 98.225 \\text{ torr}\\]\n\nRounding to three significant figures, that's 98.2 torr.\n\nNext, calculate \\(P_B\\):\n\n\\[P_B = 0.715 \\times 213\\]\n\nAgain,\n\n\\[P_B = 0.715 \\times 213 = 152.395 \\text{ torr}\\]\n\nRounding to three significant figures, that's 152 torr.\n\nNow, the total vapor pressure is:\n\n\\[P_{\\text{total}} = P_A + P_B = 98.2 \\text{ torr} + 152 \\text{ torr} = 250.2 \\text{ torr}\\]\n\nRounding to three significant figures, that's 250 torr.\n\nLooking back at the options, the closest one is 251 torr, which might be due to rounding differences.\n\nWait a minute, the problem might be expecting the answer in a specific format or perhaps considering significant figures differently.\n\nLet me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, \\(P_A = 0.285 \\times 345\\):\n\n\\[0.285 \\times 345 = 98.225 \\text{ torr}\\]\n\nRounding to three significant figures is indeed 98.2 torr.\n\nNext, \\(P_B = 0.715 \\times 213\\):\n\n\\[0.715 \\times 213 = 152.395 \\text{ torr}\\]\n\nRounding to three significant figures is 152 torr.\n\nTotal vapor pressure:\n\n\\[P_{\\text{total}} = 98.2 + 152 = 250.2 \\text{ torr}\\]\n\nRounding to three significant figures, that's 250 torr.\n\nBut the options don't have 250 torr; they have 251 torr as one of the choices. Maybe I missed something in my rounding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer without rounding intermediate steps.\n\nLet's try calculating without rounding intermediate values.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[P_A = 0.285 \\times 345 = 98.225 \\text{ torr}\\]\\[P_B = 0.715 \\times 213 = 152.395 \\text{ torr}\\]\\[P_{\\text{total}} = 98.225 + 152.395 = 250.62 \\text{ torr}\\]\n\nNow, rounding to three significant figures, that's 251 torr.\n\nAh, so perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 251 torr due to more precise intermediate calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the number of significant figures in the given data.\n\nThe vapor pressures are given to three significant figures (345 torr and 213 torr), and the mole fraction is given to three decimal places (0.285). So, my final answer should be consistent with that.\n\nIf I carry more decimal places in intermediate steps and then round at the end, I get 250.62 torr, which rounds to 251 torr.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 251 torr.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 251 torr is the correct choice.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 251 \\ \\text{torr}} \\]"
