But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her\u2013\u2013because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters\u2013\u2013to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak\u2013\u2013therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty\u2013\u2013therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.\nThat is why we must no longer lag behind.\"\nJoseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931\nStalin's speech is most strongly influenced by which of the following?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question about Stalin's speech from 1931, and I need to figure out which ideology or concept most strongly influenced his words. The options are appeasement, fascism, communism, and secret treaties. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of the speech. It's from 1931, which is during the early years of the Soviet Union, when Stalin was solidifying his power and implementing the first Five-Year Plan for rapid industrialization. The speech is addressed to a conference of leading personnel in socialist industry, so it's likely to be heavy on economic and industrial policy.\n\nNow, looking at the excerpt provided, Stalin is emphasizing the importance of not falling behind in various aspects like military, culture, politics, industry, and agriculture. He mentions that historical figures like the Mongol khans, Turkish beys, Swedish feudal lords, Polish and Lithuanian gentry, British and French capitalists, and Japanese barons all beat Russia because of its backwardness. He quotes a poet saying Russia is \"poor and abundant, mighty and impotent,\" and suggests that these adversaries took advantage of Russia's weaknesses.\n\nStalin also refers to the \"jungle law of capitalism,\" where the strong prey on the weak, and argues that to prevent being beaten and enslaved, Russia must no longer lag behind.\n\nGiven this background, let's consider each option:\n\nA. Appeasement: This is the policy of making concessions to an aggressor to maintain peace, often associated with Britain and France's approach to Hitler in the 1930s. But Stalin's speech is about not falling behind to avoid being beaten, not about making concessions. So, this doesn't seem directly relevant here.\n\nB. Fascism: Fascism is typically associated with extreme nationalism, authoritarian rule, and often militarism, exemplified by Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany. While Stalin's regime was authoritarian and emphasized national strength, communism and fascism are generally considered opposed ideologies. Communism aims for a classless society through revolution, whereas fascism supports a hierarchical society and strong national identity. So, it's unlikely that Stalin's speech is directly influenced by fascism.\n\nC. Communism: This seems plausible. Communism, as interpreted and implemented by Stalin, emphasized rapid industrialization, collectivization of agriculture, and the central planning of the economy to strengthen the Soviet Union and prevent it from being exploited by capitalist countries. The speech's focus on eliminating backwardness and building a strong, modernized nation aligns with Stalin's communist policies.\n\nD. Secret treaties: This refers to agreements between countries not disclosed to the public or other nations. While secret treaties were a feature of pre-World War I Europe and contributed to the complexity of alliances, Stalin's speech doesn't directly reference them. He's more concerned with the general principle of not lagging behind and being vulnerable to attack.\n\nConsidering all this, the most straightforward answer is that Stalin's speech is most strongly influenced by communism. However, I should think deeper to make sure there isn't another influence at play.\n\nPerhaps there's an element of realism or power politics in his speech, given the emphasis on strength and avoiding defeat. But realism is more of an approach in international relations, not an ideological influence on the speech's content.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a nationalist undertone, given the focus on Russia's historical humiliations and the need to rise above them. However, nationalism was often downplayed in official Soviet discourse in favor of international communism, although there was certainly a strain of Russian exceptionalism in Stalin's regime.\n\nStill, the primary ideology driving Stalin's policies at that time was communism, particularly his interpretation of Leninism and the need for the Soviet Union to become a modern, industrial power to lead the worldwide proletarian revolution.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's an argument to be made that Stalin's speech is influenced by fascism's emphasis on national strength and superiority. But that seems like a stretch, given that fascism and communism are ideologically opposed. Moreover, fascism was on the rise in Europe at that time, but Stalin's policies were distinctly communist.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the speech is influenced by the experiences of World War I and the perceived need to prepare for future conflicts by strengthening the economy and military. But again, that seems more related to the general geopolitical situation rather than a specific ideological influence.\n\nLet me look back at the question: \"Stalin's speech is most strongly influenced by which of the following?\" The options are appeasement, fascism, communism, and secret treaties. Given that, and considering the content of the speech, communism seems the most fitting answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any specific reference or allusion in the speech that might point towards one of the other options. For example, does Stalin mention any secret treaties that led to Russia's past defeats? No, the speech talks generally about being beaten due to backwardness, not about specific treaties.\n\nWhat about appeasement? Stalin is arguing against falling behind and being weak, which could be seen as a form of appeasement, but he doesn't use that term or concept directly. Appeasement as a policy wasn't really in vogue yet in 1931; it became more prominent in the late 1930s.\n\nFascism: In 1931, fascism was gaining ground in Europe, particularly in Italy and Germany, but Stalin's speech doesn't reference fascist ideas or policies. Instead, it aligns with Soviet communist doctrine of the time.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is that Stalin's speech is most strongly influenced by communism.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe there's a trick here. Perhaps the question is testing whether students recognize that Stalin's regime, while nominally communist, incorporated elements from other ideologies, such as fascism's emphasis on strength and order. However, in 1931, Stalin's primary focus was on implementing communist policies to transform the Soviet Union into a modern industrial power.\n\nAdditionally, the speech's reference to the \"jungle law of capitalism\" suggests that Stalin is positioning communism as the antidote to the perceived brutality of capitalist competition and imperialism.\n\nSo, after considering all the options and the context, I'm confident that communism is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
