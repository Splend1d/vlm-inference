                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this legal scenario. There's a defendant who was charged with two things: felony murder and arson. The jury found the defendant guilty of felony murder but not guilty of arson. Now, the defendant's lawyer is trying to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge. I need to figure out which option is most likely to happen.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what felony murder is. I know that felony murder is when someone dies during the commission of a felony, and the person committing the felony can be charged with murder, even if they didn't intend to kill anyone. In this case, the felony is arson, and the death resulted from the fire.\n\nSo, the defendant was charged with felony murder (count one) and arson (count two). The jury found the defendant guilty of felony murder but not guilty of arson. That seems a bit confusing because felony murder requires the underlying felony, which is arson in this case.\n\nI think there might be some inconsistency here. If the defendant is not guilty of arson, how can they be guilty of felony murder based on that arson? It's like saying they didn't commit the underlying crime but are still responsible for the death because of that crime.\n\nNow, the defendant's attorney is moving to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge. There are a few options here:\n\nA. Granted, because the guilty verdict is plain error that adversely affects the defendant's constitutional rights.\n\nB. Granted, because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges.\n\nC. Denied, because the verdicts do not amount to a reversible error.\n\nD. Denied, because the defendant's proper remedy is to seek an appellate review for a non-constitutional error.\n\nI need to think about which one makes the most sense.\n\nOption A talks about plain error that affects constitutional rights. Plain error is a standard in appellate review where an error is so obvious and substantial that it affects the fairness of the trial. But in this case, the issue is with the jury's verdicts, not necessarily with a trial error. So, I'm not sure if this applies here.\n\nOption B says the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges. This seems plausible because if the defendant is not guilty of arson, they can't be guilty of felony murder based on that arson. So, maybe both verdicts can't stand, and both should be set aside.\n\nOption C says the verdicts do not amount to a reversible error. Reversible error is an error that is serious enough to have affected the outcome of the trial, and therefore the conviction can be reversed. If the verdicts are inconsistent, that might be considered an error, but whether it's reversible depends on the specific legal standards.\n\nOption D says the motion should be denied because the proper remedy is to seek an appellate review for a non-constitutional error. This suggests that the issue is not about constitutional rights but about the consistency of the verdicts, which might be seen as a non-constitutional error.\n\nI think the key here is whether the verdicts are legally consistent. In many legal systems, a conviction for felony murder requires a conviction for the underlying felony. If the defendant is acquitted of the felony (arson), then the felony murder conviction can't stand.\n\nHowever, sometimes juries can return seemingly inconsistent verdicts, and courts may allow them if there's some rational basis for the jury's decision. Maybe the jury believed that the defendant set the fire but didn't intend to kill anyone, so they found them not guilty of arson but guilty of felony murder.\n\nBut in legal terms, if the defendant is not guilty of the underlying felony, they can't be guilty of felony murder based on that felony. So, the felony murder conviction should be set aside.\n\nWait, but sometimes, in some jurisdictions, if the death occurs during the commission of a felony, the defendant can still be guilty of felony murder even if they're not convicted of the felony. But I think that's rare.\n\nI recall a case where a defendant was acquitted of the underlying felony but convicted of felony murder, and the court had to decide whether to set aside the felony murder conviction. In some cases, the court might order a new trial on the felony murder charge, considering that the jury's findings were inconsistent.\n\nBut in this scenario, the defendant's attorney is moving to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge. So, it's a motion to dismiss the conviction based on the inconsistency of the verdicts.\n\nI think the most likely outcome is that the motion will be granted because the verdicts are legally inconsistent. The defendant can't be guilty of felony murder if they're not guilty of the underlying arson. So, option B seems the most appropriate.\n\nOption A talks about plain error affecting constitutional rights, which might not directly apply here. Option C says the verdicts don't amount to a reversible error, but if they're inconsistent, they might be considered an error. Option D suggests that the remedy is to appeal for a non-constitutional error, but perhaps the motion to set aside the verdict is a way to address the inconsistency without going through a full appeal process.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the court will deny the motion and allow the felony murder conviction to stand, arguing that there's a rational basis for the jury's decision. Then, the defendant could appeal.\n\nHowever, based on the principle that felony murder requires a conviction for the underlying felony, I think the motion will be granted, and the felony murder conviction will be set aside due to the inconsistency in the verdicts.\n\nSo, my answer is B. Granted, because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
