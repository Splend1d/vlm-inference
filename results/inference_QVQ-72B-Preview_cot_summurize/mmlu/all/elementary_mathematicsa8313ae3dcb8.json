                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that a survey of 1000 registered voters showed that 450 people would vote for candidate A in an upcoming election. And now, if 220,000 people vote in the election, I need to predict how many votes candidate A should receive based on this survey. The options are A. 44,500, B. 48,900, C. 95,000, and D. 99,000.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. So, first, there's a survey of 1000 registered voters, and out of those, 450 say they'll vote for candidate A. That means that the proportion of people voting for candidate A in this survey is 450 out of 1000. That seems like a straightforward ratio.\n\nSo, if 450 out of 1000 voters support candidate A, that's the same as 450 divided by 1000, which simplifies to 0.45, or 45%. So, the survey suggests that 45% of registered voters will vote for candidate A.\n\nNow, the total number of people voting in the election is 220,000. If we assume that the survey is representative of the entire voting population, then we can use this 45% to predict how many votes candidate A will get from the total 220,000 voters.\n\nSo, to find 45% of 220,000, I can calculate 0.45 multiplied by 220,000. Let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst, 0.45 times 200,000 would be 90,000, and then 0.45 times 20,000 is 9,000. So, adding those together, 90,000 plus 9,000 is 99,000.\n\nAlternatively, I can just directly calculate 0.45 times 220,000:\n\n0.45 \u00d7 220,000 = 99,000.\n\nSo, according to this calculation, candidate A should receive 99,000 votes.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should see if there's another way to approach this, just to confirm.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to set up a proportion. If 450 out of 1000 voters in the survey support candidate A, then for the entire electorate of 220,000 voters, the number supporting candidate A would be x out of 220,000.\n\nSo, we can set up the proportion: 450 / 1000 = x / 220,000.\n\nTo solve for x, I can cross-multiply: 450 \u00d7 220,000 = 1000 \u00d7 x.\n\nSo, 450 \u00d7 220,000 is 99,000,000, and that equals 1000x.\n\nThen, to find x, divide both sides by 1000: x = 99,000.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut hold on, I notice that 99,000 is one of the options, but it's not the only one. Are there any other factors I should consider here?\n\nWell, one thing to consider is whether the survey is truly representative of the entire voting population. But since the problem assumes that it is, I don't need to worry about that right now.\n\nAnother thing is whether there are any margins of error or confidence intervals in the survey, but again, the problem doesn't provide any of that information, so I think it's safe to proceed with the given percentages.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the total number of votes is indeed 220,000. The problem says \"220,000 people vote in the election,\" so that seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but in reality, there might be invalid votes or abstentions, but assuming that all 220,000 votes are valid and for either candidate A or candidate B, then my calculation should hold.\n\nLet me also check if there are any other candidates or if it's a two-candidate race. The problem only mentions candidate A, but it's safe to assume that the remaining votes would go to other candidates or be invalid, but since we're only predicting for candidate A, that shouldn't affect our calculation.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps using ratios. The ratio of votes for candidate A to total votes in the survey is 450 to 1000, which simplifies to 9:20, since both numbers divide by 50.\n\nSo, 9 parts out of 20 are for candidate A. Total parts are 20, and candidate A gets 9 parts.\n\nNow, total votes are 220,000. So, each part is 220,000 divided by 20, which is 11,000 votes per part. Therefore, candidate A gets 9 parts, which is 9 \u00d7 11,000 = 99,000 votes. Again, the same result.\n\nHmm, consistent results from different methods; that's reassuring.\n\nIs there any possibility of overcounting or undercounting in the survey? For example, if the survey sample isn't random, but again, the problem assumes it's a valid survey of 1000 registered voters.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the percentage of votes for candidate A. So, 450 out of 1000 is 45%, as I calculated earlier.\n\nNow, 45% of 220,000 is indeed 99,000. So, that seems to be the predicted number of votes for candidate A.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 44,500\n\nB. 48,900\n\nC. 95,000\n\nD. 99,000\n\nSo, option D. 99,000 matches my calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nMaybe the survey is only a subset of the total voters, and there are other surveys or data points that could influence the prediction. But the problem presents only this one survey, so I don't think that's applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a need to adjust for the sample size, but since the survey is directly proportional to the total votes, I think the calculation holds.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the 1000 registered voters in the survey include only those who are likely to vote, whereas the total votes could include more people who weren't surveyed. But again, the problem states that it's a survey of 1000 registered voters, and that 450 would vote for candidate A, so I think it's safe to proceed with that information.\n\nI don't see any flaws in the reasoning so far. The calculation seems consistent across different methods, and the result aligns with the options provided.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is D. 99,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D}\\ ]"
