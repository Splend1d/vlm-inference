                    "text": "So I have this question about Intelligence Quotient, or IQ for short. It's asking which formula defines the IQ. The options are:\n\nA. Chronological age divided by mental age, multiplied by 100.\n\nB. Performance score divided by verbal score, multiplied by 100.\n\nC. Mental age divided by chronological age, multiplied by 100.\n\nD. Verbal score divided by performance score, multiplied by 100.\n\nHmm, I need to recall what IQ actually is and how it's calculated.\n\nI remember that IQ was originally conceived as a measure of mental ability relative to a person's age. The term \"intelligence quotient\" suggests some kind of ratio or quotient related to intelligence.\n\nLet me think about the terms here. Chronological age is the actual age of a person in years, months, etc. Mental age refers to the level of mental development or cognitive abilities compared to what's typical for a certain age group.\n\nSo, if someone has a mental age that matches their chronological age, their IQ should be around 100, which is considered average.\n\nWait, but is it chronological age divided by mental age or the other way around?\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose a 10-year-old has the mental capabilities of an average 10-year-old, their IQ should be 100. So, mental age divided by chronological age should be 1, and multiplied by 100 gives 100.\n\nOption C says mental age divided by chronological age, times 100. That seems to fit.\n\nOption A is chronological age divided by mental age, times 100. If chronological age is 10 and mental age is 10, that would be 10/10 = 1, times 100 = 100. But if mental age is higher, say 12, then 10/12 \u2248 0.833, times 100 = 83.33, which would suggest below-average IQ, which makes sense because having a mental age of 12 at chronological age 10 is actually above average. Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no. If mental age is higher than chronological age, that should indicate above-average IQ, not below-average. So, option A seems to suggest that higher mental age leads to lower IQ, which doesn't make sense.\n\nOption C, on the other hand, mental age divided by chronological age, times 100. So, if mental age is 12 and chronological age is 10, 12/10 = 1.2, times 100 = 120, which is above average, which makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, if mental age is 8 and chronological age is 10, 8/10 = 0.8, times 100 = 80, which is below average, which also makes sense.\n\nSo, option C seems correct.\n\nBut let's look at options B and D. They mention performance scores and verbal scores. I know that some IQ tests, like the Wechsler Intelligence Scale, have both verbal and performance (non-verbal) components, and they provide separate scores.\n\nHowever, the traditional definition of IQ is based on mental age compared to chronological age, not on the ratio of performance to verbal scores.\n\nSo, options B and D seem to be referring to something else, perhaps the way subtest scores are combined in some IQ tests, but not the fundamental definition of IQ.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: mental age divided by chronological age, multiplied by 100.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider the historical context. The concept of IQ was first proposed by Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon in 1905. They developed the Intelligence Scale to assess children's mental abilities for educational purposes. The idea of IQ was popularized by Lewis Terman in the United States, who adapted Binet's scale.\n\nIn Terman's formulation, IQ was calculated as (mental age / chronological age) \u00d7 100. This formula reflects how well a child's mental abilities compare to their age group. A score of 100 indicates average intelligence, while higher or lower scores indicate above or below-average intelligence, respectively.\n\nSo, yes, option C is the correct definition of IQ.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
