This deed was not recorded until after the son's death in 1957. In 1956, the son mortgaged the dairy farm to the bank. The mortgage instrument, which was recorded in 1956, recited that it was subordinate to a mortgage on the same land given by the son to an investor in 1936 and recorded in 1936. In that instrument the son purported to grant the investor a mortgage on the dairy farm. In 1979, the friend conveyed the dairy farm to a farmer. This deed was duly recorded, but did not mention any mortgage. In 2008, a buyer entered into an agreement with the farmer, whereby the farmer would convey the dairy farm in fee simple to the buyer for the sum of $75,000. The closing date was set for January 15, 2009. All of the deeds mentioned in the aforementioned transactions are general warranty deeds. In addition, this jurisdiction has a notice-type recording statute and follows a title theory for mortgages.

                    "text": "So I've got this pretty complex property law scenario here, and I need to figure out who should prevail in this case involving a breach of covenant against encumbrances. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's map out the timeline of events:\n\n1. **1888:** Landowner owns a dairy farm.\n\n2. **1938:** Landowner conveys the farm to his son.\n\n3. **1953:** Son conveys the farm to his friend, but the deed isn't recorded until after the son's death in 1957.\n\n4. **1956:** Son mortgages the farm to the bank, and the mortgage is recorded in 1956. The mortgage is subordinate to a 1936 mortgage to an investor, which was recorded in 1936.\n\n5. **1979:** Friend conveys the farm to a farmer, and the deed is recorded, but doesn't mention any mortgage.\n\n6. **2008:** Farmer agrees to sell the farm to a buyer for $75,000, with the closing set for January 15, 2009.\n\n7. **January 15, 2009:** Sale is finalized, buyer pays $75,000, and farmer executes a general warranty deed containing several covenants of title.\n\n8. **Afterward:** Buyer learns of the 1936 mortgage from the son to the investor, which wasn't satisfied, and seeks damages for breach of the covenant against encumbrances.\n\nOkay, so the key issue here is whether the farmer has breached the covenant against encumbrances by conveying the property subject to an outstanding mortgage that the buyer wasn't aware of.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a covenant against encumbrances entails. Generally, in a warranty deed, the covenant against encumbrances guarantees that the property is free from any liens or encumbrances except those specifically disclosed at the time of conveyance.\n\nIn this case, the deed from the farmer to the buyer didn't mention any mortgage, but there's a 1936 mortgage from the son to the investor that apparently still exists.\n\nSo, the question is whether this undisclosed mortgage constitutes an encumbrance that breaches the covenant.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. The buyer should prevail because the covenant against encumbrances is a guarantee that the property is not subject to outstanding rights or interests.\n\nB. The buyer should prevail because the covenant is breached at the time the deed is delivered, entitling the covenantee to recover damages.\n\nC. The farmer should prevail because the covenant may only be breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance.\n\nD. The farmer should prevail unless the covenantee is disturbed in his actual enjoyment of the land thereby conveyed.\n\nHmm, let's analyze these one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: It's true that the covenant against encumbrances guarantees the property is free from liens and other encumbrances not disclosed. However, in some jurisdictions, the scope of this covenant can be limited by the recording statutes and the type of encumbrances that are considered \"notice\" to subsequent purchasers.\n\nGiven that the jurisdiction has a notice-type recording statute, it likely protects subsequent purchasers who record their interests first or who purchase without actual notice of prior unrecorded interests.\n\nIn this scenario, the 1936 mortgage was recorded in 1936, which is well before the farmer conveyed the property to the buyer in 2009. However, the farmer's deed in 1979 didn't mention any mortgage, and presumably, the buyer didn't have actual notice of the 1936 mortgage at the time of purchase.\n\nBut, since the mortgage was recorded in 1936, and the farmer conveyed the property in 1979, one might argue that the recording should have provided constructive notice to subsequent purchasers.\n\nWait a minute, but the farmer's deed in 1979 didn't mention the mortgage, and the buyer in 2009 might not have discovered the old 1936 mortgage during his title search, depending on how thorough the search was.\n\nPerhaps the buyer should have obtained a title insurance policy, but that's not mentioned here.\n\nMoving on to option B: It suggests that the buyer should prevail because the covenant is breached at the time the deed is delivered, allowing for damages.\n\nThis seems plausible because the covenant against encumbrances is typically considered to be in effect at the time of conveyance. If there are encumbrances that weren't disclosed at that time, it's a breach.\n\nHowever, I need to consider whether the encumbrance in question was known or should have been known by the buyer at the time of conveyance.\n\nOption C says the farmer should prevail because the covenant may only be breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance.\n\nThis seems similar to option B but perhaps suggests that the breach occurs at conveyance, but the farmer shouldn't be liable for something that happened after conveyance.\n\nBut in this case, the encumbrance existed before conveyance, so if it was an undisclosed encumbrance at the time of conveyance, it would be a breach.\n\nOption D says the farmer should prevail unless the covenantee is disturbed in his actual enjoyment of the land.\n\nThis seems to relate to whether the encumbrance has actually interfered with the buyer's use and enjoyment of the property.\n\nIn this scenario, the buyer has taken possession and learned of the mortgage, but it's not clear if the mortgage has been enforced or if it's interfering with the buyer's use of the property.\n\nPerhaps the buyer is concerned about the potential foreclosure due to the outstanding mortgage.\n\nBut the question is about seeking monetary damages for breach of the covenant, not about eviction or other issues related to possession.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the core issue is whether the farmer breached the covenant against encumbrances by conveying the property subject to an undisclosed mortgage.\n\nGiven that the mortgage was recorded in 1936, and the farmer conveyed the property in 1979 without mentioning it, and the buyer discovered it in 2009 after purchasing in 2009, it seems that there was an encumbrance that wasn't disclosed at the time of conveyance.\n\nTherefore, it appears that the buyer should prevail, as per options A and B.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if the farmer had actual knowledge of the mortgage at the time of conveyance in 2009.\n\nIf the farmer wasn't aware of the 1936 mortgage, perhaps due to a break in the chain of title or other issues, might that affect the farmer's liability?\n\nAlso, considering that the mortgage was from 1936 and may have been satisfied or otherwise invalid by 2009, but the problem states that it wasn't satisfied.\n\nAdditionally, the problem mentions that the jurisdiction follows a title theory for mortgages, which means that the lender holds title to the property until the mortgage is satisfied.\n\nThis could have implications for the buyer's rights and the farmer's liability.\n\nMoreover, the mortgage was subordinate to another mortgage, but I'm not sure how that affects this particular issue.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the priority of liens.\n\nBut getting back to the covenant against encumbrances, it's generally understood to protect the grantee from unknown encumbrances that weren't disclosed at the time of conveyance.\n\nGiven that, and assuming the buyer didn't have actual notice of the mortgage at the time of purchase, it seems that the buyer has a valid claim for breach of the covenant.\n\nTherefore, judgment should be for the buyer.\n\nSo, the answer is A. the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances is a guarantee to the grantee that the property is not subject to outstanding rights or interests.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
