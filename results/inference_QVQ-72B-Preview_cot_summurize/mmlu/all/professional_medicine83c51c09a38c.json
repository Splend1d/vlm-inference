He rates the chest pain as a 7 on a 10-point scale and notes that the pain is radiating down his left arm. Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications or any other illicit drugs. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . The patient is diaphoretic. Vital signs are temperature 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), pulse 110/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 200/100 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. Auscultation of the heart discloses an audible S1 and S2. There is no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing of the digits. The patient is fully oriented. He is treated with supplemental oxygen, a 325-mg aspirin tablet, and intravenous nitroglycerin and lorazepam. Despite therapy, he continues to have chest pain and shortness of breath. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time?\n\nA. Carvedilol\nB. Furosemide\nC. Metoprolol\nD. Phentolamine\n"

                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out the best next step in treating this patient who's having chest pain and shortness of breath after snorting cocaine for the first time. He's young, 25 years old, and hasn't had any significant medical history before this. His symptoms started an hour ago, and they're pretty severe\u2014 he rates the chest pain as a 7 out of 10, and it's radiating down his left arm. That sounds a lot like angina or maybe even a heart attack, especially given the radiation to the left arm.\n\nHe's been given aspirin, oxygen, nitroglycerin, and lorazepam, but his symptoms aren't improving. His vital signs show he's tachycardic with a pulse of 110, and his blood pressure is really high at 200/100 mm Hg. He's also diaphoretic, which is common in acute coronary syndromes.\n\nHis ECG shows sinus tachycardia without any ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. That's interesting because you might expect some changes if he's having a heart attack, but sometimes changes can be minimal, especially in the early stages or with certain types of coronary events.\n\nGiven that he's used cocaine, which is known to cause vasoconstriction and increase blood pressure and heart rate, it's likely contributing to his symptoms. Cocaine can also precipitate coronary artery spasm or even thrombosis, which could lead to myocardial infarction.\n\nSo, despite initial treatment with aspirin, nitroglycerin, and lorazepam, his symptoms persist. Now, I need to consider what additional pharmacotherapy would be most appropriate.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Carvedilol\n\nB. Furosemide\n\nC. Metoprolol\n\nD. Phentolamine\n\nFirst, Carvedilol is a beta-blocker with alpha-1 blocking properties. Beta-blockers are commonly used in acute coronary syndromes to reduce heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand. The alpha-1 blocking effect might be beneficial in countering the vasoconstriction caused by cocaine.\n\nFurosemide is a loop diuretic, often used to treat heart failure by reducing fluid overload. But in this case, the patient doesn't seem to have signs of heart failure like edema or pulmonary congestion on examination.\n\nMetoprolol is another beta-blocker, but it's more selective for beta-1 receptors, primarily affecting the heart. It's also used in acute coronary syndromes.\n\nPhentolamine is an alpha-adrenergic blocker that can be used to treat hypertension and is sometimes used specifically in cocaine overdose to manage the vasoconstriction caused by cocaine's effects on alpha receptors.\n\nGiven that the patient has persistently high blood pressure and tachycardia despite initial treatments, I need to think about what's driving these symptoms. Cocaine causes peripheral vasoconstriction and increases in catecholamines, leading to hypertension and tachycardia. So, targeting the alpha-adrenergic effects of cocaine might be crucial here.\n\nBoth Carvedilol and Phentolamine have alpha-blocking properties, which could help counteract the vasoconstriction caused by cocaine. Metoprolol, being a beta-1 selective blocker, might not fully address the alpha-mediated vasoconstriction.\n\nHowever, Carvedilol also has beta-blocking properties, which could be beneficial in reducing heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand. But there's a concern that beta-blockade without alpha-blockade could potentially lead to unopposed alpha-stimulation, causing increased vasoconstriction, which could be dangerous in the context of cocaine use.\n\nPhentolamine, on the other hand, is a pure alpha-blocker and doesn't have any beta-blocking effects. It would specifically target the vasoconstriction caused by cocaine's alpha-adrenergic stimulation.\n\nGiven that, it seems that Phentolamine might be a better choice because it directly counters the vasoconstrictive effects of cocaine without the risk of unopposed alpha-stimulation that could come from using a beta-blocker alone.\n\nBut wait, Carvedilol does have alpha-blocking properties in addition to its beta-blocking effects, which might make it a good option as well. It might provide both beta and alpha blockade, potentially preventing the unopposed alpha-stimulation issue.\n\nHowever, in acute cocaine intoxication, the alpha-adrenergic effects are particularly pronounced, and Phentolamine is specifically indicated for the management of cocaine-associated acute coronary syndromes due to its alpha-blocking properties.\n\nMetoprolol, being a beta-1 selective blocker, might not be as effective in this scenario because it doesn't address the alpha-mediated vasoconstriction.\n\nFurosemide, being a diuretic, doesn't seem directly relevant here since the patient doesn't show signs of fluid overload or heart failure.\n\nSo, between Carvedilol and Phentolamine, both have alpha-blocking properties, but Phentolamine is a pure alpha-blocker and might be more specifically indicated for the alpha-adrenergic surge caused by cocaine.\n\nAdditionally, Phentolamine is sometimes used in the emergency department specifically for cocaine-induced cardiovascular complications due to its rapid onset and short duration of action, which can be beneficial in acute settings.\n\nTherefore, I think Phentolamine is the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D}} \\]"
