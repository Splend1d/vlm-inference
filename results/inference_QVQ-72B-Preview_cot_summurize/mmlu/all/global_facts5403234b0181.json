                    "text": "So I need to figure out what percentage of the world's land area was forested in 2015. The options are 15%, 30%, 45%, and 60%. Hmm, I'm not sure about the exact number, but I think forests cover a pretty significant portion of the Earth's land. Let me see if I can recall any statistics or data related to this.\n\nI remember that the Amazon rainforest is the largest forest on Earth and covers about 40% of South America's land area. But South America is just one continent. Worldwide, there must be a lot more forested areas. There's also the Siberian taiga in Russia, which is another massive forest region.\n\nWait, but I think deforestation has been an issue for a while. I've heard that a lot of forests have been cut down over the years, especially for agriculture and logging. So maybe the percentage has been decreasing, but I don't know how much it decreased by 2015.\n\nLet me try to think of some numbers. I think the total land area of the Earth is about 150 million square kilometers. If forests cover, say, 30% of that, that would be about 45 million square kilometers. That seems like a lot, but I'm not sure if it's accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the forested area in different regions and add them up. For example, in North America, there are vast forests in Canada and the northern parts of the United States. In Europe, there are forests in Scandinavia and Russia. Then there are the tropical forests in Africa and Asia.\n\nBut that seems too vague. Maybe I should look for some global statistics. I recall that the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) publishes reports on global forest resources. Maybe I can recall some data from their reports.\n\nLet me see... I think the FAO reported that in 2010, forests covered about 31% of the global land area. If that's the case, then by 2015, with some deforestation, it might have been slightly less, maybe around 30%. But I'm not sure about the exact rate of deforestation during that period.\n\nAnother thing I remember is that the rate of deforestation has been slowing down in some regions, thanks to conservation efforts and reforestation programs. So maybe the percentage didn't decrease as much as I thought.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the total forest area in comparison to the total land area. If I can estimate both numbers, I can calculate the percentage.\n\nLet me try to recall the total land area of the Earth. I think it's approximately 150 million square kilometers. Now, what's the total forested area? I think it's around 4 billion hectares, which is 40 million square kilometers. So, 40 million divided by 150 million would be about 26.67%. That's closer to 30% than to 15% or 45%.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the current figure. Maybe the forest area has changed since then.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that forests cover about one-third of the Earth's land surface. That would put it at around 33.33%, which is higher than 30% but still within the range I'm considering.\n\nLet me think differently. If I consider that dense forests are found in the tropics, temperate regions, and boreal zones, and that these regions make up a significant portion of the land, then 30% seems plausible.\n\nAlso, I recall that the Amazon rainforest alone covers about 5.5 million square kilometers, which is about 3.6% of the Earth's land area. So, if that's one forest, then multiple forests worldwide could easily add up to 30%.\n\nMoreover, I've heard that Asia has extensive forests, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Russia, and Africa has the Congo Basin, which is another large forested region.\n\nGiven all that, I think 30% is a reasonable estimate for the percentage of the world's land area that was forested in 2015.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30\\%} \\]"
