                    "text": "Okay, so I've got this scenario about a businessman who owned a lake and wooded area. In 1980, he gave the land to the state with the condition that it be used for recreation only. Then, two years later, the state decided to develop a small part of the land into an industrial park, which goes against the recreational use condition. Now, the businessman is saying that because the state violated the condition, the property should go back to him. The question is asking what type of interest was created by this conveyance and whether the businessman can get the property back.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the different types of estate interests in property law. There's a fee simple absolute, which is the most complete ownership interest, without any conditions. Then there are more restricted interests like life estates, remainders, and things like that. But in this case, it seems like there's a condition attached to the conveyance.\n\nThe phrase \"on the condition that\" suggests that there's a condition subsequent attached to the conveyance. So, the state was given the property with the condition that it be used for recreational purposes only. If they violate that condition, there might be consequences.\n\nOption A says it's a reverter, and the property instantly reverts back to the grantor upon violation. A reverter is when the property automatically goes back to the grantor if a certain condition isn't met. But I think there's a difference between a fee simple determinable and a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. In a fee simple determinable, the property automatically reverts if the condition isn't met, whereas in a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, the grantor has to take some action to reclaim the property.\n\nOption B says it's a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, and the original owner can get the property back only by taking affirmative steps, like exercising his right of entry. This seems plausible. I recall that in a condition subsequent, the grantor has the right to\u6536\u56de\u8d22\u4ea7 if the condition is violated, but they have to take action to do so; it doesn't automatically revert.\n\nOption C mentions an executory limitation, which I think involves a third party. It says if the condition occurs, the property reverts to a pre-designated third party. But in this scenario, it's not specified that there's a third party involved. It seems like the businessman expects the property to revert back to him, not to someone else.\n\nOption D says it's an indefeasible estate, and the owner cannot enforce a condition that's against public policy. But I'm not sure if that applies here. The condition is about recreational use, which might be seen as a positive use, but developing an industrial park might be seen as against public policy in certain contexts, but I don't have enough information to make that judgment.\n\nGiven the information provided, it seems like the most accurate answer is Option B: the interest created is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, and the original owner can get the property back only by taking affirmative steps to exercise his right of entry. This is because the condition subsequent allows the grantor to reclaim the property if the condition is violated, but they have to take action to do so; it doesn't automatically revert.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any indication that it's a fee simple determinable, which would make it a reverter, as in Option A. But I think in most jurisdictions, conditions subsequent require the grantor to take action to enforce them, whereas determinable fees automatically revert upon violation.\n\nAlso, considering that the businessman is asserting his ownership and trying to take the property back, it suggests that he believes he has the right to do so upon violation of the condition. But whether that right is automatic or requires him to take legal action would depend on how the condition was phrased in the conveyance.\n\nSince the conveyance said \"on the condition that\" it be used for recreational purposes only, without specifying that the property would automatically revert, it's likely that it's a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, requiring the grantor to take action to enforce the condition.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The interest created is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, and the original owner can get the property back only by taking affirmative steps to exercise his right of entry.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
