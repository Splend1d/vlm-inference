                    "text": "Let's dive into this property law problem. It's a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step. So, we have a developer who owns a parcel of land in fee simple absolute, and the land has been unpossessed. There are several conveyances happening, and we need to figure out who owns the land in a notice jurisdiction.\n\nFirst, let's understand the sequence of events:\n\n1. Developer conveys to Artist.\n\n2. Artist conveys to Bartender.\n\n3. Artist conveys to Counselor.\n\n4. Bartender conveys to Dentist.\n\n5. Counselor conveys to Engineer.\n\nEach grantee paid value, took without actual notice of any facts that would defeat their title, and without knowledge of facts that would put them on inquiry, both when they took their deed and when they recorded it.\n\nNow, recording happened in the following order:\n\n- Developer to Artist.\n\n- Artist to Bartender.\n\n- Artist to Counselor.\n\nAnd then:\n\n- Bartender to Dentist recorded immediately after execution.\n\n- Counselor to Engineer recorded immediately after execution.\n\nAlright, so recording is important in determining who has priority over the property. In a notice jurisdiction, generally, a bona fide purchaser (BFP) who records their deed first has priority over subsequent purchasers.\n\nLet me recall what a BFP is: someone who purchases property in good faith, pays value, and without notice of any prior claims or interests.\n\nFrom the problem, each grantee is a BFP because they paid value and took without actual notice or knowledge that would put them on inquiry.\n\nNow, let's consider each conveyance:\n\n1. Developer to Artist: This is the original conveyance from the owner. Artist becomes the owner upon this conveyance, assuming it's properly executed and delivered.\n\n2. Artist to Bartender: Artist then conveys to Bartender. However, Artist also conveys to Counselor. So, Artist is making two conveyances.\n\n3. Bartender to Dentist: Bartender conveys to Dentist.\n\n4. Counselor to Engineer: Counselor conveys to Engineer.\n\nNow, recording order is:\n\n- Developer to Artist recorded.\n\n- Artist to Bartender recorded.\n\n- Artist to Counselor recorded.\n\nThen, Bartender to Dentist and Counselor to Engineer are recorded immediately after execution.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the artist-to-counselor deed was executed before any other deed, but after that, the order of recording was developer-to-artist, artist-to-bartender, and artist-to-counselor.\n\nWait, no: \"the artist-to-counselor deed was executed before the execution of any other deed, and then before the recording of any other deed, the order of recording was developer-to-artist, artist-to-bartender, and artist-to-counselor.\"\n\nWait, let's read it again:\n\n\"Assume that each person listed below as the grantee in a deed paid value and took without actual notice of any facts that would defeat her title and without knowledge of any facts that would put her on inquiry, both at the time she took her deed and at the time she recorded it. The following conveyances, each by a general warranty deed, take place in the order listed: An artist conveys to a bartender; the developer conveys to the artist; the artist conveys to a counselor; the bartender conveys to a dentist; the counselor conveys to an engineer. No deed was recorded until after the artist-to-counselor deed was executed and then before the execution of any other deed, the order of recording was as follows: developer to artist; artist to bartender; artist to counselor. The bartender-to-dentist deed and counselor-to-engineer deed were each recorded immediately after their respective executions.\"\n\nOkay, so to clarify:\n\n- The artist-to-counselor deed was executed first.\n\n- Then, before any other deed was executed, the following deeds were recorded in this order:\n\n- Developer to artist.\n\n- Artist to bartender.\n\n- Artist to counselor.\n\n- Then, the bartender-to-dentist deed was executed and recorded immediately after execution.\n\n- And the counselor-to-engineer deed was executed and recorded immediately after execution.\n\nWait, but the problem says: \"no deed was recorded until after the artist-to-counselor deed was executed and then before the execution of any other deed, the order of recording was as follows: developer to artist; artist to bartender; artist to counselor. The bartender-to-dentist deed and counselor-to-engineer deed were each recorded immediately after their respective executions.\"\n\nSo, to rephrase:\n\n- Artist-to-counselor deed is executed first.\n\n- Then, before any other deed is executed, the following deeds are recorded:\n\n- Developer to artist.\n\n- Artist to bartender.\n\n- Artist to counselor.\n\n- Then, the bartender-to-dentist deed is executed and recorded immediately after execution.\n\n- The counselor-to-engineer deed is executed and recorded immediately after execution.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"no deed was recorded until after the artist-to-counselor deed was executed and then before the execution of any other deed, the order of recording was as follows: developer to artist; artist to bartender; artist to counselor.\"\n\nSo, artist-to-counselor is executed first, but not recorded yet.\n\nThen, before any other deed is executed, the following deeds are recorded:\n\n- Developer to artist.\n\n- Artist to bartender.\n\n- Artist to counselor.\n\nWait, but artist-to-counselor was already executed but not recorded yet. So, it's being recorded now along with developer to artist and artist to bartender.\n\nThen, bartender-to-dentist and counselor-to-engineer are executed and recorded immediately after execution.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me try to map this out.\n\nSo, timeline:\n\n1. Artist-to-counselor deed is executed (but not recorded yet).\n\n2. Developer-to-artist deed is recorded.\n\n3. Artist-to-bartender deed is recorded.\n\n4. Artist-to-counselor deed is recorded.\n\n5. Bartender-to-dentist deed is executed and recorded immediately after.\n\n6. Counselor-to-engineer deed is executed and recorded immediately after.\n\nNow, in a notice jurisdiction, generally, the first to record has priority over subsequent purchasers, provided they are BFPs without notice.\n\nBut there are exceptions, especially when there are simultaneous recordings or when there's actual notice.\n\nIn this case, each grantee is a BFP, so no one has actual notice of prior claims.\n\nNow, let's trace the ownership:\n\n- Developer owns the land.\n\n- Developer conveys to Artist.\n\n- Artist now owns the land upon proper execution and delivery of the deed.\n\n- Artist then conveys to Bartender.\n\n- Artist also conveys to Counselor.\n\n- So, Artist is conveying the land to two different people.\n\n- Then, Bartender conveys to Dentist.\n\n- Counselor conveys to Engineer.\n\nNow, recording order:\n\n- Developer to Artist recorded.\n\n- Artist to Bartender recorded.\n\n- Artist to Counselor recorded.\n\nAssuming that these recordings happen in quick succession, perhaps simultaneously.\n\nBut in reality, recordings are timestamped, and the first to record gets priority.\n\nBut in this problem, since it's a notice jurisdiction and all grantees are BFPs, the first to record should have priority.\n\nSo, Developer to Artist is recorded first.\n\nThen, Artist to Bartender is recorded second.\n\nThen, Artist to Counselor is recorded third.\n\nSo, according to this, Bartender's claim is recorded before Counselor's.\n\nBut Artist conveyed to Counselor first (executed first), but Counselor's recording is third.\n\nWait, no: artist-to-counselor was executed first, but recorded third.\n\nNow, in a notice jurisdiction, the first to record has priority, provided they are a BFP.\n\nSo, Developer to Artist is recorded first.\n\nThen, Artist to Bartender is recorded second.\n\nThen, Artist to Counselor is recorded third.\n\nSo, Bartender's claim is recorded before Counselor's.\n\nBut Counselor was conveyed to first (executed first), but recorded last.\n\nNow, does that mean that Counselor has priority because they were conveyed to first, or does the recording determine priority?\n\nIn a race-notice jurisdiction, the first to record wins, provided they are a BFP without notice of prior claims.\n\nSo, in this case, Bartender recorded before Counselor, and both are BFPs, so Bartender has priority over Counselor.\n\nSimilarly, Dentist and Engineer are subsequent purchasers from Bartender and Counselor, respectively.\n\nNow, Dentist purchases from Bartender, who has a better claim than Counselor.\n\nEngineer purchases from Counselor, who has a weaker claim because they recorded after Bartender.\n\nWait, but Counselor was conveyed to by Artist, who already conveyed to Bartender.\n\nSo, Artist conveyed to Bartender and to Counselor.\n\nBut Developer only conveyed to Artist once.\n\nWait, no: Developer conveyed to Artist once.\n\nThen Artist conveyed to Bartender and to Counselor.\n\nSo, Artist is conveying the same property twice.\n\nThis is a classic case of a wild deed or a simultaneous conveyance.\n\nIn such cases, in a notice jurisdiction, the first to record has priority, provided they are a BFP without notice.\n\nSo, Bartender recorded before Counselor, so Bartender has priority over Counselor.\n\nTherefore, Dentist, who purchased from Bartender, would have a better claim than Engineer, who purchased from Counselor.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking who owns the parcel in a notice jurisdiction.\n\nSo, let's see the recording order:\n\n1. Developer to Artist recorded.\n\n2. Artist to Bartender recorded.\n\n3. Artist to Counselor recorded.\n\nThen, Bartender to Dentist recorded immediately after execution.\n\nCounselor to Engineer recorded immediately after execution.\n\nSo, Dentist's recording is after Bartender's, and Engineer's recording is after Counselor's.\n\nBut since Bartender recorded before Counselor, and Dentist recorded after Bartender, and Engineer after Counselor, it seems that Dentist has a better claim than Engineer.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking who owns the parcel now.\n\nSo, Developer conveyed to Artist.\n\nArtist conveyed to Bartender and to Counselor.\n\nBartender conveyed to Dentist.\n\nCounselor conveyed to Engineer.\n\nNow, since Bartender recorded before Counselor, Bartender has priority over Counselor.\n\nTherefore, Dentist, who purchased from Bartender, has a better claim than Engineer, who purchased from Counselor.\n\nBut Counselor was conveyed to by Artist, who already conveyed to Bartender.\n\nSo, Counselor is a subsequent purchaser from Artist, who already conveyed to Bartender.\n\nIn that case, since Bartender recorded first, Bartender has priority, and therefore, Dentist, who purchased from Bartender, has a better claim.\n\nNow, but Counselor also conveyed to Engineer.\n\nBut since Counselor's claim is inferior to Bartender's, Engineer's claim is also inferior.\n\nWait, but Counselor might have some residual rights.\n\nWait, no: Artist conveyed to Bartender and to Counselor.\n\nBartender recorded first, so Bartender has priority over Counselor.\n\nTherefore, Counselor's deed is invalid as to Bartender.\n\nSo, Counselor doesn't have any interest to convey to Engineer.\n\nTherefore, Engineer gets nothing from Counselor.\n\nMeanwhile, Dentist gets the property from Bartender, who has a better claim.\n\nBut wait, Developer conveyed to Artist.\n\nArtist conveyed to Bartender and to Counselor.\n\nBartender conveyed to Dentist.\n\nSo, the chain is Developer -> Artist -> Bartender -> Dentist.\n\nCounselor's conveyance to Engineer is invalid because Counselor had no interest to convey.\n\nTherefore, Engineer gets nothing.\n\nTherefore, Dentist is the owner.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that the artist-to-counselor deed was executed first, but recorded last.\n\nBut since Bartender recorded first, Bartender has priority.\n\nTherefore, Dentist, who purchased from Bartender, has the best claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. the dentist.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn a notice jurisdiction, the first to record has priority, provided they are a BFP without notice.\n\nAll grantees are BFPs.\n\nDeveloper to Artist is recorded first.\n\nThen Artist to Bartender is recorded second.\n\nThen Artist to Counselor is recorded third.\n\nTherefore, Bartender has priority over Counselor.\n\nDentist purchases from Bartender and records immediately after execution.\n\nEngineer purchases from Counselor and records immediately after execution.\n\nBut since Counselor's claim is inferior to Bartender's, Engineer's claim is also inferior.\n\nTherefore, Dentist has the better claim.\n\nTherefore, the owner is the dentist.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. the dentist}} \\]"
