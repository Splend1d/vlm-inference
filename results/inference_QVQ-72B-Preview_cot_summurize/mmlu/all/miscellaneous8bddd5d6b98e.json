                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here: \"Who was the first US president to resign from that office?\" And the options are A. Martin Van Buren, B. Andrew Jackson, C. Andrew Johnson, and D. Richard Nixon. Hmm, I need to think about this carefully.\n\nFirst off, I know that resigning means voluntarily giving up the position, right? So, I should look for a president who decided to step down while still in office. Let me recall some history about each of these presidents.\n\nStarting with Martin Van Buren, he was the eighth president, serving after Andrew Jackson. I think he served his full term, didn't he? I don't remember any scandal or reason why he would have resigned. In fact, I think he was succeeded by William Henry Harrison in 1841, so he must have completed his term.\n\nNext is Andrew Jackson, the seventh president. He was known for his strong personality and policies like the Indian Removal Act. But again, I don't recall him resigning before his term was up. He served two full terms, right? So, probably not him.\n\nThen there's Andrew Johnson, the 17th president, who took office after Abraham Lincoln was assassinated. He was impeached by the House of Representatives but acquitted by the Senate. I wonder if there was any talk of him resigning during that impeachment process. But from what I remember, he stayed in office until the end of Lincoln's term. So, likely not him either.\n\nFinally, there's Richard Nixon, the 37th president. He's famous for the Watergate scandal, which led to his resignation in 1974. Wait, did he actually resign? Yes, I think he did. He was facing almost certain impeachment and removal from office, so he chose to resign instead. That was in August 1974, making him the first president to resign.\n\nLet me double-check this. If Nixon resigned in 1974 and none of the other presidents listed resigned, then he must be the answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider if any of the other presidents might have resigned under different circumstances.\n\nFor example, did Martin Van Buren face any crises that might have led him to resign? Well, his presidency was during the Panic of 1837, which was an economic crisis, but I don't think he considered resigning over that. Similarly, Andrew Jackson had his share of controversies, like the Bank War, but he saw them through without resigning.\n\nAndrew Johnson, as I mentioned earlier, went through impeachment but didn't resign. In fact, I think he was close to being removed from office but managed to stay on. So, again, no resignation there.\n\nTherefore, among these options, Richard Nixon is the only one who resigned from the presidency. So, the correct answer should be D. Richard Nixon.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll quickly check if there were any presidents after Nixon who might have resigned. The next president after Nixon was Gerald Ford, who served out the remainder of Nixon's term. Then came Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and so on. None of them resigned; they either completed their terms or, in some cases, were succeeded by their vice presidents due to natural causes or assassination, but not resignation.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that Richard Nixon was the first US president to resign from office. That's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Richard Nixon}} \\]"
