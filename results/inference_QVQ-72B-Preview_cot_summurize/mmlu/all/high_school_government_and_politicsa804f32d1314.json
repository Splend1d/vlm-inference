It's asking what these documents allow the president to do in terms of selecting staff. The options are:\n\nA. Peace Corps\n\nB. White House Office\n\nC. Senate Committee on Appropriations\n\nD. Cabinet\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these documents are about. I know that reorganization plans and executive orders are tools used by the president to make changes in the structure or operation of the executive branch.\n\nLet me start by looking up Reorganization Plan 1 of 1939. From what I recall, during the New Deal era under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, there were several reforms to the executive branch to make it more efficient and responsive to the needs of the time.\n\nA quick search confirms that Reorganization Plan 1 of 1939 was part of Roosevelt's efforts to streamline the executive branch. This particular plan led to the creation of the Executive Office of the President (EOP), which houses agencies that provide direct support to the president.\n\nExecutive Order 8248, signed by Roosevelt in 1939, was related to this reorganization. It likely specified the structure and functions of the new offices within the EOP.\n\nGiven that, it seems plausible that these documents would allow the president to select the staff for the White House Office, which is part of the EOP.\n\nBut let's double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is the Peace Corps. The Peace Corps was established much later, in 1961, by President John F. Kennedy, so it wouldn't have been around in 1939.\n\nOption C is the Senate Committee on Appropriations. That's a legislative branch body, and presidential reorganization plans and executive orders typically don't give the president authority over congressional staff or committees.\n\nOption D is the Cabinet. While the president does appoint Cabinet members, subject to Senate confirmation, I need to see if Reorganization Plan 1 of 1939 or Executive Order 8248 specifically addressed Cabinet staff appointments.\n\nLooking back, the Cabinet is composed of the heads of executive departments, and while the president appoints them, the reorganization plan and executive order in question seem more focused on the structure of the executive office directly supporting the president.\n\nTherefore, the most logical answer is Option B: White House Office.\n\nTo confirm, I found that Reorganization Plan 1 of 1939 led to the creation of the Executive Office of the President, which includes the White House Office. Executive Order 8248 likely outlined the president's authority to staff this office as needed.\n\nSo, the president is allowed to select the staff for the White House Office based on these documents.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
