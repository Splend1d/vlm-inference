The mother telephoned their family doctor, who instructed her to drive the father to the local hospital. The doctor indicated that he would meet them there. A short time later at the hospital, the doctor treated the father and bandaged his hand. However, due to the fact that the father had lost a considerable amount of blood, the doctor ordered an immediate blood transfusion. After determining that the father's blood type was A-positive, the doctor orally instructed a nurse, who was employed by the hospital, to obtain the necessary blood for the transfusion. The nurse followed the doctor's instructions and telephoned the hospital's blood bank department and ordered a unit of A-positive blood. The person in the blood bank who received the nurse's call correctly wrote down the order for A-positive blood. However, someone working at the blood bank, whose identity cannot be determined, made an error in filling the order and labeling the unit of blood for the father. As a result, the blood bank sent a unit of B-positive blood mislabeled as A-positive blood. After being administered the wrong blood, the father died. The hospital has a written rule in effect whereby all orders for blood transfusions must be made in writing by the physician in charge of the patient's treatment.

                    "text": "Alright, so I'm trying to understand this situation about a father who got injured on Thanksgiving Day. He was carving a turkey and accidentally cut himself pretty badly, severing an artery. He lost a lot of blood and had to be taken to the hospital by his wife, following instructions from their family doctor. The doctor met them at the hospital and treated the father's hand, but because he had lost so much blood, the doctor ordered an immediate blood transfusion.\n\nNow, the doctor orally instructed a nurse at the hospital to get a unit of A-positive blood, which was the father's blood type. The nurse called the hospital's blood bank and ordered the A-positive blood, but somewhere along the line, there was a mistake. Someone at the blood bank sent a unit of B-positive blood instead, and it was mislabeled as A-positive. So, the father received the wrong blood type during the transfusion and unfortunately passed away.\n\nThe hospital has a rule that all orders for blood transfusions must be in writing by the physician in charge of the patient's treatment. However, the doctor in this case gave the order orally, which is something many doctors at the hospital do, even though it's against the rules.\n\nNow, the question is about what would happen if the mother decides to file a wrongful death action against the doctor. The options are:\n\nA. Prevail, because the doctor would be responsible for the blood bank's error in administering the wrong blood.\n\nB. Prevail, because the doctor did not follow the hospital's rule regarding blood transfusion orders.\n\nC. Not prevail, because the doctor acted in the same fashion as many other doctors at the hospital.\n\nD. Not prevail, because the unidentified person in the blood bank who was responsible for sending the wrong blood type was not an employee of the doctor.\n\nI need to think about this carefully.\n\nFirst, in a wrongful death action, the mother would be trying to prove that the doctor's negligence led to the father's death. Negligence typically involves a breach of duty that causes harm.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nOption A suggests that the mother would prevail because the doctor is responsible for the blood bank's error. But is that accurate?\n\nWell, the blood bank is part of the hospital, and the doctor is an independent contractor, not an employee of the hospital. So, the doctor might not be directly responsible for the blood bank's mistake. The blood bank personnel are employees of the hospital, not the doctor. So, this seems a bit off.\n\nOption B says the mother would prevail because the doctor didn't follow the hospital's rule about written orders for blood transfusions.\n\nThis is interesting. The doctor knew about the hospital's rule but chose to give an oral order instead. This deviation from the standard procedure could be seen as negligence, especially if following the written order protocol could have prevented the mistake.\n\nBut wait, the nurse who received the order was employed by the hospital, not the doctor. So, perhaps there's some shared responsibility there.\n\nOption C says the mother would not prevail because the doctor acted similarly to many other doctors at the hospital.\n\nThis seems like a weak defense. Just because many doctors do something doesn't make it acceptable or not negligent. The hospital might have a culture of cutting corners, but that doesn't absolve individual doctors of responsibility when their actions lead to harm.\n\nOption D says the mother would not prevail because the person who made the error in the blood bank wasn't an employee of the doctor.\n\nThis seems similar to Option A. Since the blood bank personnel are hospital employees, not the doctor's, the doctor might not be directly liable for their mistakes. However, the doctor did deviate from hospital protocol by giving an oral order instead of a written one, which might have contributed to the error.\n\nI think the key here is whether the doctor's decision to give an oral order instead of a written one was a breach of duty that contributed to the father's death.\n\nIf the hospital has a clear written policy that requires blood transfusion orders to be in writing, and the doctor knew about it but chose to give an oral order, that could be considered negligence.\n\nMoreover, if following the written order protocol could have prevented the mistake in blood typing, then the doctor's deviation from that protocol might be seen as a contributing factor to the father's death.\n\nSo, in that case, the mother might prevail because of the doctor's failure to follow hospital protocol, which led to the error in blood typing.\n\nTherefore, Option B seems the most plausible.\n\nBut let's consider if there are other factors at play.\n\nThe nurse who received the order was a hospital employee, not the doctor's. So, if the nurse made an error in transmitting the order, that might be the hospital's responsibility, not the doctor's.\n\nHowever, the doctor instructed the nurse to obtain the blood, and by giving an oral order, he might have increased the risk of miscommunication.\n\nAlso, the error occurred in the blood bank, where someone mislabeled the blood type.\n\nSo, even if the doctor had given a written order, could the error still have happened?\n\nIt's possible, but the written order might have provided a double-check to prevent such mistakes.\n\nTherefore, the doctor's deviation from the written order protocol likely increased the risk of such an error.\n\nAdditionally, the doctor should have been aware of the hospital's policy and adhered to it to ensure patient safety.\n\nGiven all this, it seems that the mother would most likely prevail because the doctor did not follow the hospital's rule regarding blood transfusion orders, which contributed to the father's death.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
