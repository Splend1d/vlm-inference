                    "text": "Okay, so here's this situation involving a car accident where one driver was injured due to another driver's negligence. The negligent driver had insurance with a policy limit of $15,000 for third-party liability. The injured driver demanded the full policy limit after providing all the necessary documentation, but the insurance company refused to pay without giving any reason. Later, a jury awarded the injured driver $200,000 in damages. Now, the injured driver has an assignment from the negligent motorist, giving him any rights the motorist has against the insurer. The question is whether the court will compel the insurance company to pay the full amount of the jury verdict under these circumstances.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the parties involved. The negligent driver caused the accident and was fined for driving in the wrong lane. Their insurance policy had a limit of $15,000 for third-party liability, which means that the insurance company is obligated to pay up to $15,000 for damages caused to another person in an accident.\n\nThe injured driver demanded the policy limits but the insurance company refused to pay without explanation. This refusal could be seen as bad faith, especially since they didn't provide any reason for their decision. In insurance law, there's a concept called the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which means that both parties are expected to act fairly and in good faith towards each other.\n\nHowever, in this case, the insurance company might have breached this covenant by refusing to pay the policy limits without a valid reason. This could potentially make them liable for more than just the policy limits, a concept known as bad faith damages.\n\nNow, a jury has awarded the injured driver $200,000, which is way above the policy limit of $15,000. The injured driver has also obtained an assignment from the negligent motorist, meaning that the negligent driver has transferred any rights they have against their insurance company to the injured driver.\n\nThe question is whether the court will compel the insurance company to pay the full amount of the jury verdict, which is $200,000.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The policy limit is $15,000 and that's all that can be collected by the injured person \u2014 there is no action for bad faith on an insurance contract.\n\nWell, generally, the insurance company is only obligated to pay up to the policy limit for third-party liability. However, if they act in bad faith by refusing to pay the policy limits when demanded, they might be liable for more than the policy limits.\n\nB. The insurance company breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that is implicit in every insurance contract and must pay the full amount of the judgment.\n\nThis seems plausible. If the insurance company acted in bad faith by refusing to pay the policy limits without a reason, they might be liable for the full amount of the jury verdict.\n\nC. Bad faith is personal to the insured party and his insurer \u2014 the assignment was invalid, and the injured person has no claim to compel the insurer to pay.\n\nThis suggests that the assignment from the negligent driver to the injured driver is invalid, and therefore, the injured driver cannot pursue the insurance company for the bad faith claim.\n\nD. The injured party must enforce his entire judgment against the motorist and may never pursue the insurer for that amount.\n\nThis implies that the injured driver can only go after the negligent driver personally for the amount beyond the policy limits and cannot pursue the insurance company for the full judgment.\n\nNow, I need to think about which of these is correct.\n\nFirst, in many jurisdictions, when an insurance company acts in bad faith by refusing to settle a claim within the policy limits, they can be held liable for the full amount of any excess judgment against the insured. This is because the insurance company has a duty to protect the insured from such excess judgments by settling claims promptly and fairly within the policy limits.\n\nIn this case, the insurance company refused to pay the policy limits without explanation, which could be considered bad faith. As a result, they might be liable for the full $200,000 judgment.\n\nAdditionally, the injured driver has obtained an assignment from the negligent motorist, giving him any rights the motorist has against the insurer. This assignment could be crucial because it allows the injured driver to step into the shoes of the insured and pursue any claims the insured has against the insurer, such as bad faith refusal to pay.\n\nHowever, option C suggests that bad faith is personal to the insured and the insurer, and that the assignment is invalid. This might be the case in some jurisdictions, where bad faith claims are not assignable.\n\nBut in many places, assignments of this nature are allowed, especially in cases where the insured has been judgment-proof or unable to satisfy the judgment.\n\nGiven that, option B seems the most straightforward: the insurance company breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and thus must pay the full amount of the judgment.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes that there is no bad faith action available, which isn't the case if the insurance company acted in bad faith.\n\nOption C suggests that the assignment is invalid, but without knowing the specific jurisdiction's laws, it's hard to say. However, many courts do allow such assignments.\n\nOption D states that the injured party must enforce the entire judgment against the motorist and cannot pursue the insurer for that amount. But in cases of bad faith, the insurer can be held liable for the excess judgment.\n\nTherefore, based on general insurance law principles, option B seems the most accurate.\n\nWait a minute, but in some jurisdictions, bad faith claims are personal to the insured and cannot be assigned. If that's the case here, then option C might be correct.\n\nHowever, even if the assignment is invalid, the negligent motorist could still sue the insurance company for bad faith, and the injured driver could potentially collect from the motorist's recovery.\n\nBut the question is whether the court will compel the insurance company to pay the full amount of the jury verdict directly to the injured person under these facts.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the injured person has an assignment from the motorist, if the assignment is valid, then the injured person could pursue the bad faith claim against the insurer.\n\nIf the assignment is invalid, then the injured person would have to rely on the motorist to pursue the bad faith claim and then collect from the motorist.\n\nBut in many jurisdictions, assignments of this nature are permitted, especially in situations where the insured assigns their rights to the injured party to avoid collection issues.\n\nTherefore, assuming the assignment is valid, option B would be correct.\n\nAlternatively, even if the assignment is invalid, the injured person still has a judgment against the motorist for $200,000, but the insurance company only owes $15,000 under the policy, unless there's bad faith.\n\nSo, to fully answer this question, I need to consider whether the assignment of the bad faith claim is valid.\n\nUpon a quick search, I find that in some states, assignments of bad faith claims are permitted, while in others, they are not, as bad faith claims are considered personal to the insured.\n\nFor example, in California, bad faith claims are personal to the insured and generally cannot be assigned. However, in other states, such as Arizona, assignments of bad faith claims are allowed.\n\nWithout knowing the specific jurisdiction, it's challenging to be certain.\n\nBut assuming that the assignment is valid, then option B would be correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the assignment is invalid, then the injured person cannot directly compel the insurance company to pay the full amount of the judgment, and would have to pursue the motorist for the excess amount or encourage the motorist to sue the insurance company for bad faith.\n\nGiven that, option C seems to suggest that the assignment is invalid, making the injured person unable to compel the insurer to pay.\n\nHowever, option B assumes that the assignment is valid and that the insurer must pay the full amount.\n\nGiven that the question states that the injured claimant obtained a signed assignment from the negligent motorist, giving to the claimant any rights that the motorist may have had against his insurer, and without specifying any invalidity of the assignment, I will proceed with the assumption that the assignment is valid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: The insurance company breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that is implicit in every insurance contract and must pay the full amount of the judgment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
