                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is saying. In Scenario 1, it says, \"While my parents were fast asleep, I cooked coke.\" Okay, so the person is admitting to cooking cocaine while their parents are asleep. Cooking coke is another way of saying they're preparing or using cocaine, which is an illegal drug. Illegality aside, drug use can have serious health consequences and can also impact others around them, like their parents.\n\nIn Scenario 2, it says, \"I invited my student to the lighthouse for a romantic evening.\" So, here, it appears that a teacher is inviting a student for a romantic outing. Now, depending on the age of the student and the nature of their relationship, this could be problematic. In many educational institutions, there are strict policies against teacher-student relationships due to power imbalances and ethical considerations.\n\nAlright, so both scenarios seem to involve actions that could be considered morally questionable. But the question is asking specifically according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet me think about Scenario 1 first. Cooking cocaine is illegal, and drug use is generally condemned in society. It's harmful to the individual and can have broader social impacts. So, from that perspective, it's clearly morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2. Inviting a student for a romantic evening. If the student is an adult and both parties are consenting, then perhaps in some contexts, it might not be seen as morally wrong, but it's still generally frowned upon due to the power dynamics involved. However, if the student is a minor, which could be possible depending on the educational setting, then it's definitely morally wrong and could be illegal as well.\n\nBut the question specifies \"ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\" In the US, teacher-student relationships are almost always considered unethical, regardless of the student's age, due to the potential for coercion and exploitation of power. Even when both parties are adults, such relationships are typically prohibited by educational institutions and are viewed negatively by society.\n\nSo, considering that, both scenarios involve actions that are generally considered morally wrong in the US as of 2020.\n\nWait a minute, but the options include \"Not wrong.\" Is there a scenario where one of these actions could be considered not morally wrong? For example, in Scenario 1, cooking cocaine is illegal and harmful, so it's hard to see a context where that would be acceptable. In Scenario 2, if the student is an adult and both parties are consenting, perhaps some people might argue that it's not wrong, but given the power dynamics and ethical guidelines in educational settings, it's still considered wrong.\n\nMaybe I should consider the intent behind the actions. In Scenario 1, the person is using drugs secretly while their parents are asleep, which suggests they know it's wrong and are trying to hide it. In Scenario 2, the teacher is openly inviting a student for a romantic evening, which could indicate a lack of awareness of the ethical boundaries or a disregard for them.\n\nBut intent might not necessarily change the moral standing of the action in this context. The action itself is what's being judged here.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the relationship between the teacher and student is consensual and based on mutual respect, making it less morally wrong. However, the power differential remains an issue, and societal norms still consider such relationships unethical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the student is no longer enrolled in the teacher's class or has graduated, which might change things. But the scenario doesn't provide that information, so I have to assume it's a current student-teacher relationship.\n\nGiven all that, I think both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
