                    "text": "So I have this question about voyeurs, and I need to pick which statement is true. Let me see what the options are.\n\nOption A says they are generally middle-aged. Hmm, I don't know much about the age demographics of voyeurs. Maybe it's something that can affect people of different ages, not necessarily just middle-aged. But maybe there's some research that shows a typical age range.\n\nOption B says they are usually dangerous. That seems a bit broad. Voyeurism is about observing others without their consent, usually in a sexual context. But does that make them dangerous? I think it depends on the context and the individual. Some voyeurs might just observe, while others could act in more intrusive or harmful ways. So, I'm not sure if \"usually dangerous\" is accurate.\n\nOption C says they typically want to view friends' sexual behaviors. That seems specific. Voyeurism is generally about observing strangers or people they don't know well in intimate situations. I think viewing friends might be a different dynamic. Maybe some do, but I don't think it's the typical case.\n\nOption D says they typically want to observe strangers' activities. This seems more in line with my understanding of voyeurism. Voyeurs often get arousal from watching unknown people in private acts or situations without their knowledge.\n\nLet me think again. If I recall correctly, voyeurism involves obtaining sexual gratification by secretly watching others who are naked, in the process of undressing, or engaging in sexual activities. This is often done without the knowledge or consent of the observed individuals.\n\nGiven that, option D seems the most accurate because it describes the typical behavior of voyeurs\u2014wanting to observe strangers' activities.\n\nOption C suggests they want to view friends' sexual behaviors, but I think voyeurs are more likely to target strangers rather than friends. There might be some exceptions, but generally, it's about the thrill of watching unknown people.\n\nOption A mentions they are generally middle-aged. I don't have enough information to confirm that. Voyeuristic behavior can occur across different age groups, not just in middle age.\n\nOption B says they are usually dangerous. While some voyeurs might escalate their behavior beyond just observing, many do not progress to more harmful actions. So, it's probably not accurate to say they are usually dangerous.\n\nTherefore, based on my understanding, option D is the correct choice: they typically want to observe strangers' activities.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility that another option could be true. For example, maybe in some cases, voyeurs are middle-aged, but that doesn't seem to be a defining characteristic. Similarly, while some voyeurs might be dangerous, it's not a universal trait.\n\nSo, I think option D is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
