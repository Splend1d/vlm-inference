                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about evaluating outcomes. It's asking for two examples of an evaluation of outcome, and the options are:\n\nA. Change in attitude\n\nB. Placement of message\n\nC. Distribution of message\n\nD. Size of attentive audience\n\nNow, I need to pick two that are examples of evaluating outcomes. Let me think about what evaluating an outcome means. Basically, it's about assessing the results or the effects of some activity or communication, right?\n\nSo, looking at the options:\n\nA. Change in attitude \u2013 that sounds like a direct result of some communication or intervention. If someone's attitude changes after being exposed to a message, that seems like a clear outcome.\n\nB. Placement of message \u2013 this seems more about where or how the message was delivered, not necessarily about the result or the effect it had on the audience.\n\nC. Distribution of message \u2013 similar to placement, this is more about the spread or delivery of the message, not about the impact it had.\n\nD. Size of attentive audience \u2013 this is about how many people paid attention to the message. While it's important to know how many people were reached, is that considered an outcome?\n\nHmm. An outcome is typically about the change or effect that results from the communication, not just about the delivery or the reach.\n\nSo, change in attitude seems like a definite outcome because it's about altering someone's thoughts or feelings.\n\nSize of attentive audience might be more of a measure of reach or exposure, not necessarily the outcome.\n\nBut maybe I should think differently. In some contexts, having a larger audience could be considered an outcome because it achieves the goal of reaching more people, which could be the desired effect.\n\nBut I'm still leaning towards change in attitude as a primary outcome.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose there's a public health campaign to promote vaccination. The message is distributed through various channels, like social media, TV ads, and community events.\n\nThe placement of the message would be where these ads appear, like prime time TV or specific websites.\n\nThe distribution would be how widely these messages are spread, like how many people could potentially see them.\n\nThe size of the attentive audience would be how many people actually paid attention to the message, maybe measured by views or engagement.\n\nBut the outcome, the desired result, is changing people's attitudes towards vaccination, right? Like making them more accepting or likely to get vaccinated.\n\nSo, in this case, change in attitude seems like the direct outcome.\n\nThe size of the attentive audience is important because it tells you how many people heard the message, but it's not the ultimate goal. The ultimate goal is to change behavior or attitudes.\n\nSimilarly, placement and distribution are important for ensuring the message reaches the right people, but again, they're more about the delivery mechanism rather than the effect.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe in some contexts, placement and distribution can be considered outcomes if they were the objectives.\n\nFor example, if the goal was to place messages in certain high-traffic areas or to distribute them widely, then achieving that could be considered an outcome.\n\nBut generally, in communication evaluation, outcomes are more about changes in knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps change in attitude is one definite outcome, and the size of the attentive audience is another, because if more people are paying attention, that could lead to more attitudes changing.\n\nBut then, if the audience is large but their attitudes aren't changing, is that really an outcome?\n\nWait, maybe not. Maybe it's just increased awareness without actual attitude change.\n\nSo, change in attitude is a clear outcome because it's a change in the audience.\n\nSize of attentive audience is more about reach or exposure, which could be a precursor to attitude change, but not the outcome itself.\n\nPlacement and distribution are also about the delivery process, not the effect on the audience.\n\nMaybe I should go with A and D, change in attitude and size of attentive audience.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Maybe I need to look up the definition of outcome evaluation.\n\nOkay, quick search: Outcome evaluation is a type of evaluation that assesses the extent to which a program has achieved its intended outcomes or objectives, often focusing on changes in knowledge, skills, attitudes, behaviors, or health status.\n\nSo, based on that, change in attitude fits perfectly as an outcome.\n\nSize of attentive audience seems more related to reach or exposure, which might be part of process evaluation rather than outcome evaluation.\n\nPlacement and distribution are also part of process evaluation, ensuring the message was delivered as intended.\n\nTherefore, the best answers are A. Change in attitude and maybe one other, but based on this, change in attitude is definitely an outcome.\n\nMaybe I should choose A and C, but no, distribution of message seems more like a process measure.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous. Maybe it's testing whether I can distinguish between process and outcome measures.\n\nIn that case, change in attitude is clearly an outcome, and the others are more process measures.\n\nBut the question says \"two examples of an evaluation of outcome,\" so maybe it's expecting more than just change in attitude.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in certain contexts, like marketing or advertising, the size of the attentive audience is considered an outcome because it achieves the goal of maximizing exposure.\n\nBut even then, often the ultimate goal is to change behavior or attitudes, not just to have a large audience.\n\nPerhaps in some cases, like awareness campaigns, having a large audience is the primary outcome because the goal is to make as many people aware as possible.\n\nBut even then, typically, awareness is seen as a step towards attitude change or behavior change.\n\nSo, perhaps size of attentive audience is an intermediate outcome, while change in attitude is a more direct outcome.\n\nBut the question is to identify two examples of evaluation of outcome, and it doesn't specify the level of outcome.\n\nTherefore, both could be considered outcomes, with change in attitude being a more direct measure of impact.\n\nGiven that, I think A and D are the best choices.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider another example. Suppose a company launches a new advertising campaign to increase brand loyalty.\n\nThey measure changes in customer attitudes towards the brand (outcome), the number of people who saw the ads (size of attentive audience), where the ads were placed (placement), and how widely they were distributed (distribution).\n\nIn this scenario, change in attitude and size of attentive audience are both important for evaluating the outcome of the campaign.\n\nThe placement and distribution help ensure the message reaches the target audience but don't directly measure the effect of the campaign.\n\nTherefore, A and D seem to be the correct choices.\n\nI think I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A \\text{ and } D} \\]"
