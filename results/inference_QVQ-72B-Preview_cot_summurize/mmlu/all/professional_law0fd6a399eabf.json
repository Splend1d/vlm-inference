                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out whether the accountant's testimony is admissible in court. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nThere's a tenant who lived in an apartment building owned by a landlord. The landlord died in an accident in July. In August, the tenant sued the administrator of the landlord's estate. The tenant says that he had a contract with the landlord to mow the lawn and do some maintenance work for $50 a week, but the landlord hasn't paid him for the last six months. The tenant claims there's a written contract, but the only copy was kept by the landlord and it was probably destroyed in a robbery a few months back.\n\nAt trial, the tenant calls the landlord's accountant to testify. The accountant says she saw the contract and remembers its terms, which match what the tenant is saying. She also confirms that the contract was likely destroyed in the robbery.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the accountant's testimony is admissible. The options are:\n\nA. Admissible as secondary evidence under the circumstances.\n\nB. Admissible as a written admission by the party opponent.\n\nC. Inadmissible under the Dead Man's Statute.\n\nD. Inadmissible, because the accountant's testimony is not the best evidence.\n\nFirst, I should recall some basic evidence rules.\n\nStarting with the Best Evidence Rule: Generally, if there's an original document, that's the best evidence. But if the original is unavailable, under certain conditions, secondary evidence (like testimony about the document) can be admitted.\n\nIn this case, the original contract is presumably destroyed, so the Best Evidence Rule might not bar the testimony if the original can't be produced.\n\nOption D suggests that the testimony is inadmissible because it's not the best evidence. But since the original is apparently unavailable, maybe secondary evidence is allowed.\n\nNext, the Dead Man's Statute (Option C): This is a rule that historically prevented interested parties from testifying about communications with a deceased person. However, many jurisdictions have modified or abolished this rule, especially in civil cases.\n\nGiven that this is a civil case and the landlord is deceased, I need to check if the Dead Man's Statute applies here. Maybe it's not an issue, or perhaps it only applies to specific types of testimony.\n\nOption B mentions a written admission by the party opponent. I'm not sure how that applies here. The accountant is testifying about seeing the contract, not making an admission against the estate's interest.\n\nOption A seems the most relevant: secondary evidence under the circumstances.\n\nLet me think about the rules regarding secondary evidence. If the original document is lost or destroyed without fault of the proponent, then testimony about its contents can be admitted.\n\nIn this scenario, the contract was likely destroyed in a robbery, which seems like an event beyond the control of the tenant or the estate. So, perhaps the conditions for admitting secondary evidence are met.\n\nBut wait, the accountant is testifying about what she saw in the contract. Is her testimony considered secondary evidence of the contract's contents?\n\nI think so. Secondary evidence is typically testimony or other evidence that indirectly proves the content of a document when the original is unavailable.\n\nTherefore, under the circumstances where the original document is destroyed and cannot be produced, the accountant's testimony about its contents should be admissible as secondary evidence.\n\nNow, considering the other options:\n\nB: Written admission by the party opponent. I don't see that here. The accountant is testifying about the contract, not making an admission against the estate's interest.\n\nC: Dead Man's Statute. This might not apply in this situation, especially since the accountant is testifying about a document she saw, not necessarily about private conversations with the deceased.\n\nD: Inadmissible because it's not the best evidence. While the Best Evidence Rule would normally require the original document, since it's unavailable, secondary evidence is allowed under the exceptions.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, Option A seems to be the correct answer: admissible as secondary evidence under the circumstances.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any other rule or statute that might prevent the accountant's testimony from being admitted?\n\nFor example, is there any hearsay issue here? The accountant's testimony about the contract's contents is based on what she saw in the document, which is her direct knowledge. It's not hearsay because it's not testimony about what someone else said; it's about what she personally observed.\n\nAlso, is the accountant considered an expert witness or a fact witness? In this case, she's likely a fact witness because she has direct knowledge of the contract.\n\nAnother consideration: Does the robbery and destruction of the document raise any suspicions about the authenticity of the tenant's claim? Maybe the landlord destroyed the document intentionally, but the accountant's testimony suggests it was destroyed in a robbery, which seems like an innocent event.\n\nMoreover, the accountant's testimony aligns with the tenant's claims, which adds credibility.\n\nI think the main issue here is the admissibility of secondary evidence due to the original document being unavailable.\n\nTherefore, the trial judge should rule that the accountant's testimony is admissible as secondary evidence under the circumstances.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
