                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"What sporting event is held annually on Memorial Day weekend?\" And the options are A. Iditarod, B. Kentucky Derby, C. Indianapolis 500, and D. Super Bowl. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these events takes place on Memorial Day weekend every year.\n\nFirst off, I should probably recall what Memorial Day is and when it's celebrated. Memorial Day is a federal holiday in the United States for honoring and mourning the military personnel who have died while serving in the country's armed forces. It's observed on the last Monday of May, which means the weekend around that time is generally considered Memorial Day weekend.\n\nNow, I need to match one of these sporting events to this specific weekend.\n\nLet's start with option A: Iditarod. I know that the Iditarod is a famous sled dog race in Alaska. But when does it take place? I think it's in the winter, maybe February or March, because it has to do with snow and ice conditions. Let me confirm that. A quick search in my mind tells me that the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race usually starts in early March. So, that's not Memorial Day weekend, which is in late May. Maybe I should eliminate option A.\n\nNext, option B: Kentucky Derby. The Kentucky Derby is a prestigious horse race held in Louisville, Kentucky. It's often referred to as the \"Run for the Roses\" because of the rose garland given to the winner. When is it held? I recall that it's traditionally run on the first Saturday in May. So, that would be early May, not Memorial Day weekend at the end of May. For example, in 2021, the Kentucky Derby was on May 1st, which was the first Saturday of May. Memorial Day that year was on May 31st. So, that's a no for option B.\n\nOption C: Indianapolis 500. This is a famous car race, part of the IndyCar Series, held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Indiana. I've heard that it's traditionally held around Memorial Day. Let me think about this. I think it's always on the Sunday before Memorial Day. So, that would make it part of the Memorial Day weekend. For instance, in 2021, Memorial Day was on May 31st, and I believe the Indianapolis 500 was on May 30th, which is the Sunday before Memorial Day. That seems to fit perfectly. So, this could be the correct answer.\n\nLastly, option D: Super Bowl. The Super Bowl is the championship game of the National Football League (NFL). I know that it's held annually, but when exactly? I think it's usually in February, towards the end of the month. For example, Super Bowl 2021 was on February 7th, which is well before Memorial Day weekend. So, that doesn't match our timeframe.\n\nAfter considering all the options, it seems that the Indianapolis 500 is the sporting event held annually on Memorial Day weekend. To double-check, I can recall that many people consider the Indy 500 as a staple of Memorial Day weekend festivities, and it's commonly referred to as part of the \"Triple Crown of Motorsport.\" Plus, the timing aligns perfectly with the Sunday before Memorial Day.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. Indianapolis 500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Indianapolis 500}} \\]"
