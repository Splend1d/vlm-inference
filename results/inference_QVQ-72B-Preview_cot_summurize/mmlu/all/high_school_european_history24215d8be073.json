The quote is from his famous book \"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\" written in the late 18th century. The statement says that different modes of worship in Rome were seen as equally true by the people, equally false by philosophers, and equally useful by magistrates.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Gibbon is saying here. He's talking about the diverse religious practices in ancient Rome and how different groups viewed them. The people thought all these religions were true, philosophers considered them all false, and magistrates found them all useful.\n\nNow, the question is asking how this interpretation of ancient Roman religion can be seen as evidence for certain things in 18th-century Britain. The options are:\n\nA. The clergy's monopoly on academic scholarship in 18th-century Britain\n\nB. The hatred of all things Roman by British scholars in the 18th century\n\nC. The spread of religious skepticism among the educated elite of Britain in the 18th century\n\nD. The lack of sources available to 18th-century scholars for the study of ancient Roman civilization\n\nI need to think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: the clergy's monopoly on academic scholarship. Hmm, I don't see a direct connection here. Gibbon's statement is about the perception of religions in ancient Rome, not about who controlled academic scholarship in 18th-century Britain. While it's true that in some periods the clergy had a significant role in education and scholarship, this seems like a stretch from the given quote. So, probably not the best choice.\n\nOption B: hatred of all things Roman by British scholars in the 18th century. This also doesn't seem to align with the quote. Gibbon is analyzing Roman religious practices, not expressing disdain for Roman culture as a whole. In fact, \"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" is a monumental work that shows a deep engagement with Roman history and culture, not hatred. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nOption C: the spread of religious skepticism among the educated elite of Britain in the 18th century. This is interesting. The 18th century was a time of the Enlightenment, when reason and scientific inquiry were increasingly valued, often leading to skepticism about traditional religious beliefs. Gibbon was a product of this era, and his work reflects Enlightenment thinking.\n\nIn the quote, he mentions that philosophers in ancient Rome considered all the different modes of worship equally false. Philosophers in Gibbon's time would likely have been the educated elite, similar to those in ancient Rome. So, if ancient Roman philosophers were skeptical of religion, perhaps this resonated with the growing skepticism among the educated classes in 18th-century Britain.\n\nMoreover, Gibbon himself was known for his critical approach to history and religion. His work often questioned the influence of Christianity on the Roman Empire, sometimes in a critical light. Therefore, his interpretation of Roman religious beliefs could be seen as reflecting the Enlightenment's skeptical attitude towards organized religion.\n\nOption D: the lack of sources available to 18th-century scholars for the study of ancient Roman civilization. This is another possibility. In the 18th century, access to ancient texts and archaeological evidence might not have been as extensive as it is today. However, this was also a period when there was a renewed interest in classical antiquity, and many ancient texts were being rediscovered and translated.\n\nBut, considering that Gibbon wrote a detailed history of the Roman Empire, it's clear that he had access to a wealth of sources. While there might have been limitations, suggesting a complete lack of sources seems too strong. Additionally, the quote doesn't indicate any uncertainty due to a lack of information; it presents a clear interpretation.\n\nComparing options C and D, option C seems more directly supported by the quote. Gibbon's portrayal of ancient Roman philosophers as seeing all religions as equally false aligns with the Enlightenment's skeptical view of religion. This suggests that Gibbon's interpretation reflects the spreading skepticism among the educated elite in 18th-century Britain.\n\nTo make sure, let's consider the context of the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment emphasized reason, science, and empirical evidence, often leading to questioning of traditional authorities, including religious ones. Figures like Voltaire, Rousseau, and Hume were prominent in promoting these ideas.\n\nEdward Gibbon, although not as radically skeptical as some of his contemporaries, was influenced by Enlightenment thought. His historical writing often reflected a critical approach to religious claims, particularly those of Christianity, which was a dominant religion in Britain.\n\nTherefore, his statement that ancient Roman philosophers considered all religions false can be seen as an endorsement of philosophical skepticism, a view that resonated with the educated elite of his time.\n\nIn conclusion, the best answer is option C: the spread of religious skepticism among the educated elite of Britain in the 18th century.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
