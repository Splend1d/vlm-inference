Prophase II.\n\nI remember that meiosis is divided into two main stages: meiosis I and meiosis II. Each of these has prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase stages. So, it's like having two sets of these phases.\n\nFirst, I should recall what recombination is. Recombination is when genetic material is shuffled between chromosomes. This is important because it increases genetic diversity in offspring.\n\nNow, I need to think about when this shuffling happens during meiosis.\n\nLet me consider meiosis I first. This is the reductional division where homologous chromosomes separate. Prophase I is the early stage of meiosis I, and that's when homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange genetic material through a process called crossing over.\n\nWait, does crossing over happen in prophase I? I think so. Let me verify that.\n\nIn prophase I, there are several sub-stages: leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, diplotene, and diakinesis. During pachytene, homologous chromosomes are closely paired, and crossing over occurs, where chromosomes exchange corresponding segments.\n\nSo, if crossing over is happening in prophase I, that would suggest that recombination occurs in prophase I.\n\nBut let me make sure. Is there any recombination happening in other stages?\n\nIn metaphase I, the homologous chromosomes are lined up at the equator of the cell, but I don't think recombination occurs there. It's more about preparing for the separation of homologs.\n\nAnaphase I is when the homologous chromosomes separate and move to opposite poles. Again, no recombination there; it's the result of the previous recombination events.\n\nTelophase I is when the cells prepare to divide. No recombination happens here.\n\nNow, moving on to meiosis II, which is similar to mitosis in that sister chromatids separate.\n\nIn prophase II, the chromosomes condense again, but I don't think recombination occurs here. The sister chromatids are already identical at this point, so there's no need for recombination between them.\n\nMetaphase II involves the alignment of sister chromatids at the equator, anaphase II is when they separate, and telophase II completes the division.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that recombination only occurs in prophase I during meiosis I.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I'll think about the purpose of recombination. Recombination is crucial for generating genetic variation by exchanging DNA between homologous chromosomes. This happens before the homologs separate, which occurs in anaphase I.\n\nSo, logically, recombination must occur before anaphase I, and prophase I is the stage where this happens.\n\nAdditionally, I recall that during prophase I, there are physical structures called synaptonemal complexes that hold the homologous chromosomes together, facilitating the crossing over process.\n\nThis further supports the idea that recombination occurs in prophase I.\n\nI should also consider that in meiosis II, since we're dealing with sister chromatids, which are identical copies of each other, there wouldn't be any benefit to recombining them. They already share the same genetic information.\n\nTherefore, recombination doesn't occur in meiosis II.\n\nSo, to answer the question, recombination occurs in prophase I of meiosis I.\n\nWait a minute, but one of the options is prophase II. Is there any chance that recombination could occur in prophase II?\n\nWell, as I thought earlier, prophase II is part of meiosis II, where sister chromatids are separated. Since sister chromatids are identical, there's no genetic recombination happening there.\n\nMaybe sometimes people get confused between prophase I and prophase II, but based on my understanding, recombination definitely occurs in prophase I.\n\nLet me check a biology textbook or a reliable online source to confirm this.\n\n[Imagining searching for \"when does recombination occur in meiosis\"]\n\nOkay, according to standard biology textbooks, recombination, or crossing over, occurs during prophase I of meiosis I.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. Prophase I.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the other options:\n\nA. Metaphase I: This is when homologous chromosomes are aligned at the equator, but recombination has already occurred by this point.\n\nC. Metaphase II: This is part of meiosis II, where sister chromatids are aligned before separation. No recombination here.\n\nD. Prophase II: Again, part of meiosis II, involving sister chromatids, no recombination occurs here.\n\nTherefore, the only correct answer is B. Prophase I.\n\nI think I've got it right. Recombination occurs in prophase I of meiosis I.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
