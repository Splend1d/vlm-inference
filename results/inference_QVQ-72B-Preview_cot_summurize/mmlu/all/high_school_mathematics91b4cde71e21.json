                    "text": "So I've got this cubic function, f(x) = x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 \u2013 9x \u2013 18, and I need to figure out which of these statements is true. Let's tackle them one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: f(x) = 0 has three real solutions. Okay, so I need to find out how many real roots the equation x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 \u2013 9x \u2013 18 = 0 has. One way to approach this is to try to factor the polynomial or use the rational root theorem to find possible rational roots. The rational root theorem says that any possible rational root, p/q, is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is -18, and the leading coefficient is 1, so possible rational roots are the factors of -18, which are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b16, \u00b19, \u00b118.\n\nLet's test some of these to see if any of them are roots. Starting with x = 1:\n\nf(1) = (1)\u00b3 + 2(1)\u00b2 \u2013 9(1) \u2013 18 = 1 + 2 \u2013 9 \u2013 18 = -24 \u2260 0\n\nNext, x = -1:\n\nf(-1) = (-1)\u00b3 + 2(-1)\u00b2 \u2013 9(-1) \u2013 18 = -1 + 2 + 9 \u2013 18 = -8 \u2260 0\n\nx = 2:\n\nf(2) = (2)\u00b3 + 2(2)\u00b2 \u2013 9(2) \u2013 18 = 8 + 8 \u2013 18 \u2013 18 = -20 \u2260 0\n\nx = -2:\n\nf(-2) = (-2)\u00b3 + 2(-2)\u00b2 \u2013 9(-2) \u2013 18 = -8 + 8 + 18 \u2013 18 = 0! Wow, so x = -2 is a root. That means (x + 2) is a factor of f(x).\n\nSo, f(x) = (x + 2)(x\u00b2 + ax + b), and I can use polynomial division or synthetic division to find the quadratic factor.\n\nAlternatively, since I know one root, I can perform polynomial long division of f(x) by (x + 2).\n\nLet's divide x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 \u2013 9x \u2013 18 by (x + 2):\n\nx\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 \u2013 9x \u2013 18 divided by x + 2.\n\nFirst term: x\u00b3 / x = x\u00b2.\n\nMultiply (x + 2) by x\u00b2: x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2.\n\nSubtract from f(x): (x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 \u2013 9x \u2013 18) - (x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2) = -9x \u2013 18.\n\nNext term: (-9x)/x = -9.\n\nMultiply (x + 2) by -9: -9x \u2013 18.\n\nSubtract from the remainder: (-9x \u2013 18) - (-9x \u2013 18) = 0.\n\nSo, f(x) = (x + 2)(x\u00b2 - 9).\n\nAnd x\u00b2 - 9 is a difference of squares, which factors into (x + 3)(x - 3).\n\nTherefore, f(x) = (x + 2)(x + 3)(x - 3).\n\nSetting f(x) = 0 gives us roots at x = -3, x = -2, and x = 3. All three are real numbers, so option A is true.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there are any multiple roots or something, but no, they are all distinct.\n\nAlright, moving on to option B: f(x) \u2265 \u201318 for all x \u2265 0.\n\nSo, for x \u2265 0, does f(x) \u2265 \u201318?\n\nGiven that f(x) = (x + 2)(x + 3)(x - 3), let's plug in x = 0:\n\nf(0) = (0 + 2)(0 + 3)(0 - 3) = 2 * 3 * (-3) = -18.\n\nSo, at x = 0, f(x) = -18.\n\nNow, for x > 0, let's see what happens.\n\nTake x = 1:\n\nf(1) = (1 + 2)(1 + 3)(1 - 3) = 3 * 4 * (-2) = -24, which is less than -18.\n\nSo, f(1) = -24, which is not greater than or equal to -18. Therefore, option B is false.\n\nNext, option C: f(x) \u2264 \u201318 for all x \u2264 0.\n\nSo, for x \u2264 0, does f(x) \u2264 \u201318?\n\nWe already know that at x = 0, f(x) = -18.\n\nLet's try x = -1:\n\nf(-1) = (-1 + 2)(-1 + 3)(-1 - 3) = (1)(2)(-4) = -8.\n\n-8 is greater than -18, so f(-1) = -8 \u2264 -18 is not true. Therefore, option C is false.\n\nLastly, option D: The function f(x) is decreasing for x \u2264 \u20133.\n\nSo, we need to determine if f(x) is decreasing for x \u2264 \u20133.\n\nTo find where the function is increasing or decreasing, we need its derivative and analyze the sign of the derivative.\n\nFirst, find f'(x):\n\nf(x) = x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 \u2013 9x \u2013 18\n\nf'(x) = 3x\u00b2 + 4x \u2013 9\n\nWe need to find where f'(x) is negative, which indicates where the function is decreasing.\n\nSo, set f'(x) < 0:\n\n3x\u00b2 + 4x \u2013 9 < 0\n\nThis is a quadratic inequality. Let's find the roots of 3x\u00b2 + 4x \u2013 9 = 0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-4 \u00b1 \u221a(16 + 108)] / 6 = [-4 \u00b1 \u221a124] / 6 = [-4 \u00b1 2\u221a31] / 6 = (-2 \u00b1 \u221a31)/3\n\nSo, the roots are x = (-2 + \u221a31)/3 and x = (-2 - \u221a31)/3.\n\nNow, 3x\u00b2 + 4x \u2013 9 is a upward-opening parabola (since the coefficient of x\u00b2 is positive), so it's negative between the roots.\n\nThat is, 3x\u00b2 + 4x \u2013 9 < 0 for (-2 - \u221a31)/3 < x < (-2 + \u221a31)/3.\n\nNow, let's approximate \u221a31. Since 5.5\u00b2 = 30.25 and 5.6\u00b2 = 31.36, \u221a31 \u2248 5.57.\n\nSo, (-2 - 5.57)/3 \u2248 -7.57/3 \u2248 -2.523\n\nAnd (-2 + 5.57)/3 \u2248 3.57/3 \u2248 1.19\n\nTherefore, f'(x) < 0 for approximately -2.523 < x < 1.19.\n\nBut we're interested in x \u2264 \u20133.\n\nFrom the earlier analysis, f'(x) < 0 only between approximately -2.523 and 1.19.\n\nFor x \u2264 \u20133, which is less than -2.523, the derivative f'(x) should be positive (since the parabola opens upwards, it's negative only between the roots).\n\nWait, no. Actually, for x < (-2 - \u221a31)/3 \u2248 -2.523, the parabola is positive, because it's to the left of the left root.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again.\n\nFor a quadratic with positive leading coefficient, it's negative between the roots and positive outside.\n\nSo, for x < (-2 - \u221a31)/3, f'(x) > 0\n\nFor (-2 - \u221a31)/3 < x < (-2 + \u221a31)/3, f'(x) < 0\n\nFor x > (-2 + \u221a31)/3, f'(x) > 0\n\nTherefore, for x \u2264 \u20133, which is less than (-2 - \u221a31)/3 \u2248 -2.523, f'(x) > 0, meaning the function is increasing, not decreasing.\n\nTherefore, option D is false.\n\nSo, the only true statement among the options is A: f(x) = 0 has three real solutions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
