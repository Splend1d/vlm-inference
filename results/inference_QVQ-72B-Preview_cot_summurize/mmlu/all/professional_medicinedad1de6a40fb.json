                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this case to figure out. Let's see what's going on here. There's a 15-year-old boy who's been brought in with a painful swelling over his sacral area. This started two days ago, and it happened after he fell during a high school wrestling match. He also has a low-grade fever. When the doctor examined him, they found a red, swollen, and raised area with three small holes in the middle. They also did a rectal exam, but didn't find any hardness or pain there.\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to understand where the sacral prominence is. The sacrum is the triangular bone at the base of the spine, above the coccyx, which is the tailbone. So, the sacral prominence is probably the part that sticks out a bit in that area.\n\nNow, he has a painful swelling there that started after a fall during wrestling. So, it might be related to the injury from the fall. But he also has a low-grade fever, which suggests that there might be an infection involved.\n\nThe examination shows an erythematous (red), fluctuant (feels filled with fluid), elevated mass with three midline pores. So, it's red, feels like there's fluid inside, and it's raised above the skin surface. And there are three small holes in the middle. The rectal exam was normal, no induration (hardening) or pain.\n\nAlright, so let's think about the possible diagnoses here. The options are:\n\nA. anocutaneous fistula\n\nB. coccygodynia\n\nC. hidradenitis suppurativa\n\nD. pilonidal abscess\n\nI need to understand what each of these is and see which one fits the description best.\n\nStarting with option A, anocutaneous fistula. From what I recall, a fistula is an abnormal passage or connection between two organs or from an organ to the outside of the body. An anocutaneous fistula would be a passage from the anus to the skin surface. Symptoms might include discharge from the skin opening, pain, especially during bowel movements, and sometimes swelling or redness around the area. However, in this case, the description mentions a mass with pores, but doesn't specify any discharge. Also, the rectal exam was normal, with no induration or pain, which might not necessarily rule out a fistula, but it makes it less likely.\n\nMoving on to option B, coccygodynia. This is pain in the coccyx area, which is the tailbone. It's often caused by injury, like falling directly onto the tailbone. Symptoms include localized pain, sometimes numbness or tingling, and discomfort when sitting. But in this case, the patient has a swelling with multiple pores and a low-grade fever, which suggests more of an infectious process rather than just localized pain from injury.\n\nOption C, hidradenitis suppurativa. This is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects the sweat glands, particularly the apocrine glands. It's characterized by recurrent boils or abscesses in areas where these glands are found, like the armpits, groin, or under the breasts. Symptoms include painful lumps under the skin, which can rupture and release foul-smelling discharge. However, while hidradenitis can occur in the sacral area, it's less common there compared to other sites. Also, the presence of three midline pores might not align perfectly with hidradenitis, although it's possible.\n\nFinally, option D, pilonidal abscess. This is an infection that occurs in the pilonidal fossa, which is a small dimple or pit near the top of the coccyx, just below the sacrum. These pits can trap hair and debris, leading to infection and the formation of an abscess. Symptoms include pain, swelling, redness, and sometimes drainage of pus from the area. Interestingly, multiple pores or openings can be present in chronic cases.\n\nHmm, pilonidal abscess seems to fit a lot of the description here. The location is right\u2014sacral prominence near the coccyx. The symptoms match: painful swelling, redness, fluctuation (indicating fluid collection), and multiple pores. The low-grade fever also suggests an infectious process.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nAnocutaneous fistula: While possible, the rectal exam was normal, which might make this less likely, unless the fistula doesn't involve the rectum enough to be detected rectally.\n\nCoccygodynia: The main symptom is pain, but the physical findings suggest more than just pain; there's a significant skin change and possible infection.\n\nHidradenitis suppurativa: While possible, it's less common in this location, and the multiple midline pores might not align perfectly.\n\nPilonidal abscess: Seems to fit best. The fall during wrestling could have aggravated an existing pilonidal fossa, leading to infection and abscess formation.\n\nAdditionally, the age of the patient\u201415 years old\u2014is within the typical age range for pilonidal sinus disease, which often presents in adolescents and young adults, especially those who are hairy or have a family history of the condition.\n\nSo, based on the history and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis appears to be a pilonidal abscess.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider some other possible conditions that could present similarly.\n\n1. Sebaceous cyst: These are common benign skin lesions that can become infected, causing pain and redness. However, they typically don't have multiple pores and are more common in areas with more sebaceous glands, like the scalp, face, or back, but less so in the sacral region.\n\n2. Infected epidermal inclusion cyst: Similar to a sebaceous cyst, these can become infected and cause similar symptoms. Again, location might not be typical.\n\n3. Botulism: This is a rare but serious infection caused by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. It can cause flaccid paralysis and other symptoms, but doesn't typically present with a localized swelling and pores. So, that's unlikely.\n\n4. Sacral decubitus ulcer: Also known as a pressure sore, these can occur over bony prominences like the sacrum, especially in people who are immobile. However, this patient is a 15-year-old wrestler, presumably active, so less likely to develop a pressure ulcer from immobility.\n\n5. Sacral meningocele: This is a rare congenital condition where part of the spinal canal protrudes through the sacrum. It might cause a swelling, but it's unlikely to be painful or infected unless complicated.\n\nGiven all that, pilonidal abscess still seems the most plausible diagnosis.\n\nNow, what's the next step in management?\n\nTreatment for a pilonidal abscess typically involves incision and drainage (I&D) to relieve the pressure and allow the infection to heal. This can often be done under local anesthesia in an outpatient setting. Antibiotics might also be prescribed to treat any underlying infection, especially if the patient is febrile.\n\nAdditionally, to prevent recurrence, which is common in pilonidal disease, the patient might need more definitive surgical treatment, such as excision of the pilonidal sinus or fossa.\n\nBut for now, given the acute presentation with an abscess and fever, I&D and possibly a course of antibiotics would be appropriate initial management.\n\nI should also advise the patient to keep the area clean and dry, avoid sitting for prolonged periods, and wear loose-fitting clothing to prevent irritation and reduce the risk of infection recurrence.\n\nMoreover, since the patient is a wrestler, it's important to ensure that he is not contagious and that returning to sports doesn't pose a risk to others. He should probably avoid wrestling until the infection is fully resolved and any open wounds have healed.\n\nIn summary, based on the history and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is a pilonidal abscess, and the patient should be treated accordingly with incision and drainage, possibly antibiotics, and appropriate aftercare to prevent recurrence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD. pilonidal abscess"
