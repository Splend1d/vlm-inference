                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these options is the best example of a negative supply shock to the economy. The options are:\n\nA. A decrease in government spending.\n\nB. A decrease in the real interest rate.\n\nC. An increase in the money supply.\n\nD. Unexpectedly higher resource prices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a negative supply shock is. From what I recall, a supply shock is an unexpected change in the price of inputs that affects the overall production capacity of the economy. A negative supply shock would be one that reduces this capacity, leading to higher costs and potentially lower output.\n\nSo, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: A decrease in government spending.\n\nI know that government spending is a component of aggregate demand. If government spending decreases, it might reduce overall demand in the economy, which could lead to lower output and possibly deflationary pressures. But this seems more related to demand-side rather than supply-side shocks. So, maybe this isn't the best example of a negative supply shock.\n\nOption B: A decrease in the real interest rate.\n\nA decrease in the real interest rate typically makes borrowing cheaper, which can stimulate investment and consumption. This should lead to increased production and higher output. So, this seems like a positive for the supply side, not a negative shock.\n\nOption C: An increase in the money supply.\n\nAn increase in the money supply can lead to higher spending if the velocity of money increases or if people decide to spend more. This again seems like a demand-side issue. While it can affect prices, it doesn't directly relate to the cost of production or the supply capacity of the economy.\n\nOption D: Unexpectedly higher resource prices.\n\nThis sounds promising. If resource prices, like oil or raw materials, suddenly increase without warning, it would raise the cost of production for many businesses. This could lead to higher costs per unit produced, which might cause firms to supply less at any given price. That sounds like a negative supply shock because it reduces the supply capacity of the economy.\n\nLet me double-check this understanding. A negative supply shock is something that increases the cost of production or reduces the ability of firms to produce goods and services. Among the options, unexpectedly higher resource prices directly increase production costs, which fits this definition.\n\nThe other options seem to affect demand rather than supply. A decrease in government spending reduces demand, a decrease in the real interest rate stimulates demand, and an increase in the money supply also tends to stimulate demand.\n\nTherefore, the best example of a negative supply shock in this list is D. Unexpectedly higher resource prices.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
