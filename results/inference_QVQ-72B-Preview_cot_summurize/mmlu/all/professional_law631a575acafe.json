                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here where Justin's estate is suing Polly for wrongful death. It says that Officer Friendly interviewed Polly right after the event, and Officer Friendly is going to testify that Polly said, \"Oops, I was cleaning my pistol and it went off and shot Justin. I sure was negligent!\" And the question is, is Officer's testimony admissible?\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall some rules about evidence, particularly about hearsay and exceptions to the hearsay rule. Because Officer Friendly is testifying about what Polly said, which is an out-of-court statement being offered in court, that's typically hearsay unless it falls under an exception.\n\nSo, let's consider the options given:\n\nA. Yes, statement against interest.\n\nB. No, hearsay without an exception.\n\nC. Yes, admission by party.\n\nD. No, opinion on an ultimate issue that must be left for the jury.\n\nOkay, let's break these down.\n\nStarting with option A: statement against interest. I remember that a statement against interest is an exception to the hearsay rule. It's a statement that, at the time of making it, was against the declarant's own interest and is offered against a party who has adverse interests. Here, Polly is the one who made the statement, and it's being offered against her (since it's her negligence that's being questioned). But I think there might be an issue with who the declarant is and who the party is. Wait, in a civil case like this, is a statement against interest admissible if it's being offered against the declarant themselves?\n\nLet me think about that. In criminal cases, statements against penal interest are exceptions to hearsay, but in civil cases, it might be different. Maybe it's not directly applicable here.\n\nMoving on to option B: no, hearsay without an exception. Well, if the statement doesn't fall under any exception, then it shouldn't be admitted. But I need to check if there's an exception that applies.\n\nOption C: yes, admission by party. Hmm, I've heard of admissions by party-opponent in civil cases. If a party makes a statement that's against their position in the case, that statement can be admitted against them. In this case, Polly is the defendant, and her statement suggests negligence, which is against her interest. So, maybe this is a valid exception.\n\nOption D: no, opinion on an ultimate issue that must be left for the jury. This seems a bit tricky. The statement includes \"I sure was negligent,\" which sounds like an opinion on the ultimate issue of whether she was negligent. In some jurisdictions, opinions by lay witnesses on ultimate issues can be allowed if they're helpful to the jury, but often, conclusions like negligence are left for the jury to decide based on the facts.\n\nBut in this case, it's Polly who is making the statement, not an expert or another witness. So, maybe her admission of negligence is an exception because it's her own acknowledgment of fault.\n\nWait, maybe both options A and C could apply here. Statement against interest and admission by party seem relevant. But I need to figure out which one is most appropriate.\n\nLet me look up the rules for admissions by party in civil cases. I recall that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, statements by a party-opponent are not considered hearsay and are admissible. So, if Polly is the defendant and she made a statement against her interest, that should be admissible.\n\nBut what about the part where she says \"I sure was negligent\"? Is that too much of a conclusion for the jury? Maybe the court would allow it because it's her own words and it's an admission.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire statement is admissible under the admission by party exception, but the court might instruct the jury to consider only certain parts of it or to not take her word as the final say on negligence.\n\nI think the key here is that it's Polly's own statement against her interest, and under the rules, that should make it admissible.\n\nSo, between the options given, I would lean towards C: yes, admission by party.\n\nBut let me double-check. If I choose A, statement against interest, that also seems applicable, but in civil cases, admissions by party are a specific exception.\n\nMaybe C is more precise in this context.\n\nOption B is likely incorrect because there is an exception that applies.\n\nOption D seems less relevant because it's about opinions on ultimate issues, and while that's a consideration, the primary issue here is the hearsay exception for admissions by party.\n\nSo, my answer would be C: yes, admission by party.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
