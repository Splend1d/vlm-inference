                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Which of these games is not played with cards?\" And the options are A. baccarat, B. rummy, C. craps, D. solitaire. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that baccarat is a casino card game. It's pretty popular in Las Vegas and other gambling spots. So, definitely involves cards. That means option A is probably not the correct answer.\n\nNext is rummy. I've played rummy before; it's a fun card game where you have to make sets or runs with the cards you're dealt. So, again, that's definitely a card game. Option B is out of the question.\n\nThen there's craps. Now, craps is a dice game, right? I think it's mainly played with dice, not cards. Let me double-check that. In craps, players bet on the outcome of rolls of two dice. The dealer doesn't deal cards; instead, the players take turns rolling the dice. So, yeah, no cards involved in craps. That seems like it could be the answer.\n\nLastly, solitaire. Solitaire is a classic card game where you play alone, hence the name. You use a deck of cards and try to arrange them in a specific way, usually by suit and order. So, that's definitely a card game. Option D is not the correct answer.\n\nSo, to sum it up:\n\nA. Baccarat \u2013 card game\n\nB. Rummy \u2013 card game\n\nC. Craps \u2013 dice game (not cards)\n\nD. Solitaire \u2013 card game\n\nTherefore, the game that is not played with cards is craps.\n\nWait a minute, just to be thorough, is there any chance that craps could involve cards in some variations? I mean, I know some casinos might have variations where cards are used, but in the standard game of craps, it's all about the dice, right? Yeah, I'm pretty confident that craps isn't a card game.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the definition of each game. Baccarat, rummy, and solitaire are all well-known card games, while craps is renowned for its dice-based gameplay. So, based on this, craps stands out as the game that doesn't use cards.\n\nJust to make extra sure, maybe I can think about the origins of each game. Baccarat has a long history in Europe, rummy has variations all over the world, craps originated in the Western hemisphere, possibly from ancient dice games, and solitaire has been around for centuries as a pastime for individuals. Despite their different origins, the categorization based on the primary equipment used\u2014cards versus dice\u2014still holds true.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here; the question seems straightforward. It's simply asking which one of these games isn't played with cards, and craps fits that description perfectly.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. craps.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
