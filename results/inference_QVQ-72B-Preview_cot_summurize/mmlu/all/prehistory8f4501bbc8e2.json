                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about Stonehenge. It's been a while since I've studied it, but I remember that Stonehenge is this prehistoric monument in England, right? It's famous for its big stones arranged in circles and stuff. Anyway, the question is about the names of different parts of it.\n\nThe question says: \"The 30 upright stones at Stonehenge are called _______; the horizontal stones are _________.\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. legumes, sarsens\n\nB. lintels, stelae\n\nC. sarsens, lintels\n\nD. trilithon, tholoi\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what the different parts of Stonehenge are called. I know that Stonehenge has these big standing stones, and some of them are arranged in pairs with horizontal stones on top. That's probably what they're referring to here.\n\nLet me think about the upright stones. There are about 30 of them, right? I think they're called sarsens. Yeah, that sounds familiar. Sarsens are those big sandstone blocks that make up the outer circle and the horseshoe shape in the center.\n\nNow, the horizontal stones that lie on top of the upright ones, what are those called? I think they're called lintels. Yeah, that makes sense because in architecture, a lintel is a horizontal beam that supports the weight above an opening, like a door or a window. In this case, they're supporting the stones above them in the structure.\n\nSo, if the upright stones are sarsens and the horizontal ones are lintels, then the correct answer should be C. sarsens, lintels.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is legumes and sarsens. Legumes are like beans and peas, which doesn't make sense in this context. So, that can't be right.\n\nOption B is lintels and stelae. Stelae are ancient standing stones, often inscribed or carved, which might be similar to the upright stones at Stonehenge, but I don't think that's the correct term here.\n\nOption D is trilithon and tholoi. A trilithon is a structure consisting of two upright stones supporting a horizontal one, which is essentially what the sarsens and lintels form at Stonehenge. However, trilithon refers to the entire structure, not just one part of it. Tholoi are round tombs, like the ones found in Mycenae, Greece, which isn't related to Stonehenge.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is C. sarsens, lintels.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if trilithon refers to the entire structure or just parts of it. But no, trilithon is the structure made up of two uprights and a lintel on top, so it's not specifically referring to just the uprights or just the horizontals.\n\nSo, yeah, I think C. sarsens, lintels is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
