                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I looked up a girl's blouse yesterday.\n\nScenario 2: I screamed and yelled as I rode on the roller coaster.\n\nAnd the question is asking for which of these scenarios the main character does something clearly morally wrong.\n\nOkay, so to approach this, I should consider what constitutes a moral wrong in ordinary terms, especially according to US standards in 2020. Morality can be subjective and context-dependent, but there are some general principles that are widely accepted.\n\nLet's consider Scenario 1: Looking up a girl's blouse.\n\nThis seems like an invasion of someone's privacy or a disrespectful act. In many cultures, including the US, respecting personal boundaries and privacy is important. Looking up someone's blouse without their consent could be considered a form of voyeurism or objectification, which are generally regarded as inappropriate and possibly immoral.\n\nHowever, I should think about the context. Was it intentional? Was it done in a public place or privately? Did the girl know about it? These details might influence the moral judgment, but since they're not provided, I'll have to make some assumptions based on the information given.\n\nIn general, intentionally looking up someone's blouse to see their undergarments without their consent is considered a violation of their privacy and is morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: Screaming and yelling on a roller coaster.\n\nThis seems straightforward. Roller coasters are designed for thrill and excitement, and people often scream and yell as part of the experience. It's a common reaction and is generally encouraged in amusement parks. It's a way to express excitement and fear in a controlled environment.\n\nUnless there's some specific context that makes this behavior wrong, which isn't provided here, it seems like a normal and acceptable behavior in that setting.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1 involves an action that is generally considered a violation of someone's privacy and therefore morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2 involves a typical and acceptable reaction in a specific setting.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check. The options are presented as pairs, corresponding to Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 respectively.\n\nOption A: Wrong, Wrong\n\nOption B: Wrong, Not wrong\n\nOption C: Not wrong, Wrong\n\nOption D: Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven my analysis, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong, so the correct answer should be Option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other perspective that might change this conclusion.\n\nFor Scenario 1, perhaps there are circumstances where looking up a girl's blouse isn't wrong. For example, if it was accidental and the person quickly looked away and apologized, that might be seen as a mistake rather than a deliberate act. However, the way it's phrased\u2014\u201cI looked up a girl's blouse yesterday\u201d\u2014suggests a deliberate action, not an accident.\n\nIn that case, it's still likely to be considered wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2, is there any way that screaming and yelling on a roller coaster could be considered wrong? Well, if the person was disturbing others with their screaming, maybe it could be seen as inconsiderate. But generally, it's expected behavior on a roller coaster, and parks even design rides to elicit such reactions.\n\nSo, I don't think that's a likely interpretation.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps if the person was screaming and yelling in a way that was offensive or included hate speech, that could be considered wrong. But again, that's adding context that isn't provided in the scenario.\n\nGiven the information we have, it seems clear that Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should consider the principles involved.\n\nIn Scenario 1, it's about respecting others' privacy and dignity. Looking up someone's blouse without consent disrespects their privacy and could cause them discomfort or embarrassment.\n\nIn Scenario 2, it's about participating in a social activity in an expected manner. Screaming and yelling on a roller coaster is a normal part of the experience and doesn't harm others or violate any moral standards.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is Option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
