One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.\n\u2014Voltaire, in a letter, 1755\nThe ideas expressed by Voltaire, above, best illustrate which of the following characteristics of Enlightenment intellectuals?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Voltaire and his response to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. I need to figure out which characteristic of Enlightenment intellectuals is best illustrated by his ideas in this letter. Let me read the letter again to make sure I understand what he's saying.\n\nHe starts by saying that nature is very cruel, and it's hard to understand why such disasters happen in \"the best of possible worlds.\" That phrase sounds familiar; I think he's referencing Leibniz's philosophy, which suggested that we live in the best possible world created by God. But Voltaire seems to be questioning that, given the devastation of the earthquake.\n\nHe mentions that hundreds of thousands of people, including families and businessmen, were destroyed or ruined by the earthquake. He also mentions the Inquisition and hopes that the inquisitors were also crushed in the ruins. This suggests that he's critical of the Inquisition, which was a religious tribunal known for persecuting people who didn't adhere to Catholic doctrine.\n\nThen he says, \"What a wretched gamble is the game of human life!\" which conveys a sense of the unpredictability and harshness of life. He wonders what preachers will say about this disaster and seems to suggest that it might teach people not to persecute each other because disasters can befall anyone, including the persecutors.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Many were accomplished scientists, who added important pieces to human understanding of the universe.\n\nWhile Voltaire was interested in science and promoted the ideas of Newton, he wasn't primarily known as a scientist himself. So, this doesn't seem directly relevant to his letter about the Lisbon earthquake.\n\nB. They utilized new methods of communicating their ideas, such as salons and inexpensive printed pamphlets.\n\nThis is true; Enlightenment intellectuals did use various means to spread their ideas. However, this option is about the methods of communication, not about the content of his ideas in this particular letter.\n\nC. Most rejected religion altogether and adopted atheism as the only credo of a rational man.\n\nThis is a strong statement. While some Enlightenment thinkers were atheists, many were deists, believing in a rational God who created the universe but didn't interfere with it. Voltaire himself was critical of organized religion and the Church, but I don't think he was a full-blown atheist. He seems more critical of religious institutions and their actions, like the Inquisition, rather than rejecting the existence of God entirely.\n\nD. Many believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.\n\nThis seems promising. Voltaire's letter expresses a critique of religious persecution and suggests that disasters like earthquakes should teach people to be less intolerant. He seems to be advocating for a more rational and tolerant attitude towards others, regardless of their beliefs.\n\nLet me think more about option D. The Enlightenment was characterized by a shift towards scientific reasoning and empirical evidence, moving away from traditional authorities like the Church. This led many Enlightenment thinkers to advocate for more tolerant and objective approaches to social issues, emphasizing reason and humanism.\n\nIn his letter, Voltaire is reflecting on the Lisbon earthquake and using it as an opportunity to criticize religious persecution and intolerance. He seems to be suggesting that since disasters affect everyone, regardless of their beliefs or actions, it's pointless and cruel to persecute others for their differences.\n\nSo, his letter aligns with the idea that scientific understanding and observation can lead to more rational and tolerant views on social issues. Therefore, option D seems to be the best fit.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any other option that might be more appropriate?\n\nOption A is about scientific achievements, which isn't directly related to the content of the letter.\n\nOption B is about communication methods, which isn't addressed in this particular letter.\n\nOption C claims that most Enlightenment intellectuals rejected religion altogether and became atheists. While some did, this is an overgeneralization. Many Enlightenment thinkers, like Voltaire, were deists and believed in a God who created the universe but didn't intervene in it. They criticized organized religion and its institutions, but didn't necessarily reject the existence of God.\n\nTherefore, option C is too strong and not entirely accurate.\n\nOption D, on the other hand, captures the essence of Voltaire's thoughts in this letter. He's using scientific and observational evidence (the earthquake) to argue for a more tolerant and rational approach to social issues, specifically religious persecution.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is D. Many believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
