                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a pastry chef who makes apple turnovers. Normally, he makes 15 apple turnovers in 15 minutes, but when culinary arts students are watching him, he makes 20 apple turnovers in the same amount of time. And I need to figure out which psychological concept this best exemplifies. The options are:\n\nA. Foot-in-the-door phenomenon\n\nB. Social loafing\n\nC. Social facilitation\n\nD. The bystander effect\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to understand each of these concepts and see which one fits the situation described.\n\nStarting with the foot-in-the-door phenomenon. From what I remember, this is a persuasive technique where someone gets you to agree to a small request first, and then later asks for a bigger request, relying on the initial compliance to influence you. For example, a charity might ask you to sign a petition (small request) and then ask for a donation (bigger request). Does this relate to the pastry chef making more turnovers when being watched? Not really. It seems more about individual compliance to requests rather than performance in front of an audience. So, probably not A.\n\nNext, social loafing. This is when individuals exert less effort in a group setting because they feel their contribution is less visible or less necessary. Think about a group project where some members don't pull their weight because they know others will pick up the slack. But in this scenario, it's just the pastry chef being observed by students, not working in a group. He's actually performing better when being watched, making more turnovers. Social loafing would suggest the opposite\u2014that he might put in less effort when being watched. So, this doesn't seem to fit either. Probably not B.\n\nNow, social facilitation. This concept suggests that the presence of others can enhance or impair performance depending on the task's difficulty and the individual's skill level. Specifically, when a skilled person is performing a simple or well-learned task, the presence of others can improve performance. Conversely, if the task is complex or not well-learned, performance might deteriorate under observation. In this case, the pastry chef is highly skilled at making apple turnovers, and his performance improves when being watched by students. This sounds like social facilitation at work\u2014his well-practiced skills are being enhanced by the audience.\n\nLastly, the bystander effect. This is the phenomenon where individuals are less likely to offer help to a victim when other people are present. It's about diffusion of responsibility in group situations. For example, if someone is in trouble in a crowded area, each person might assume someone else will help, leading to no one helping. This doesn't relate to the pastry chef making more turnovers when being watched. So, probably not D.\n\nLet me double-check. The pastry chef normally makes 15 turnovers in 15 minutes, but when students are watching, he makes 20. So, his performance improves under observation. Social facilitation suggests that the presence of others can enhance performance on simple or well-learned tasks, which seems to be the case here. The other options don't align as closely with the scenario described.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. Social facilitation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
