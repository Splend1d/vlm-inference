                    "text": "So Sue lost her job at a shoe factory because the economy went into a recession. I need to figure out what type of unemployment this is. The options are frictional, cyclical, seasonal, and structural unemployment. Let me think about each one.\n\nFirst, frictional unemployment. I think that's when people are between jobs, like they quit their old job and are looking for a new one. It's usually short-term because they're actively searching for work. But in Sue's case, she lost her job because of a recession, which seems different from quitting to find something better.\n\nNext, cyclical unemployment. That sounds like it's related to the economic cycle, like when the economy goes up and down. A recession is a downturn in the economy, right? So, during a recession, businesses might cut back on production and lay off workers because demand for their products decreases. So, maybe Sue is cyclically unemployed because her job was lost due to the recession.\n\nThen there's seasonal unemployment. That's when people lose their jobs at certain times of the year due to seasonal changes, like workers in tourism or agriculture who have busy seasons and slow seasons. Since Sue works in a shoe factory, I don't think her unemployment is seasonal unless shoes have a seasonal demand, which might be possible, but it doesn't seem as directly tied to seasons as, say, farming or Christmas retail.\n\nLastly, structural unemployment. I think that's when there's a mismatch between the skills workers have and the skills that employers need. Maybe technology changes and workers need different abilities, or industries move to different areas. But in Sue's case, the factory just laid her off because of the recession, not because her skills were outdated or the industry was changing structurally.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems like cyclical unemployment is the best fit for Sue's situation. She lost her job directly because of the recession, which is a phase in the economic cycle. The other types don't seem to align as closely with her circumstances.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Frictional unemployment is more about voluntary job changes, which isn't what happened to Sue. Seasonal unemployment is tied to specific times of the year, and I don't have any information suggesting that Sue's unemployment is seasonal. Structural unemployment involves skill mismatches or industry shifts, which isn't mentioned here. So, yeah, cyclical unemployment seems to be the correct choice.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider the definition of each type again:\n\n- Frictional unemployment: short-term unemployment due to the time it takes for workers to find new jobs.\n\n- Cyclical unemployment: unemployment that results from fluctuations in the business cycle, particularly during recessions.\n\n- Seasonal unemployment: unemployment due to seasonal variations in certain industries.\n\n- Structural unemployment: unemployment caused by a mismatch between the skills or locations of workers and the requirements of available jobs.\n\nGiven these definitions, Sue's situation aligns most closely with cyclical unemployment because her job loss was directly related to the recession, which is a cyclical phase of the economy.\n\nI think I've got it. The answer should be B. cyclically unemployed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
