                    "text": "So I have this problem here about price elasticity of demand and how it affects total revenue. The business has estimated that the price elasticity of demand for their product is 3. They want to raise total revenue, and I need to figure out whether they should increase or decrease the price based on the elasticity value.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what price elasticity of demand means. I recall that price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in the price of that good. The formula is usually:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Price Elasticity of Demand} = \\frac{\\text{Percentage change in quantity demanded}}{\\text{Percentage change in price}}\n\\]\n\nThe value of elasticity can tell us a lot about the behavior of demand when price changes.\n\nIf elasticity is greater than 1, demand is considered elastic, meaning that a small change in price leads to a proportionally larger change in quantity demanded.\n\nIf elasticity is less than 1, demand is inelastic, meaning that a change in price causes a smaller proportional change in quantity demanded.\n\nIf elasticity is exactly 1, demand is unit elastic, and revenue doesn't change with a price change.\n\nIn this case, the elasticity is 3, which is greater than 1, so demand is elastic.\n\nNow, the question is about total revenue, which is price multiplied by quantity demanded (TR = P \u00d7 Q).\n\nGiven that demand is elastic, I need to think about how changing the price will affect total revenue.\n\nI remember that when demand is elastic, decreasing the price actually increases total revenue because the increase in quantity demanded more than offsets the decrease in price.\n\nConversely, if demand is inelastic, increasing the price would increase total revenue because the decrease in quantity demanded is less than proportional to the price increase.\n\nSo, in this scenario, since elasticity is 3, which is greater than 1, demand is elastic. Therefore, to raise total revenue, the business should decrease the price.\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\nIf elasticity is 3, and we decrease the price, say by 1%, the quantity demanded would increase by 3%, leading to an increase in total revenue.\n\nOn the other hand, if we increase the price by 1%, quantity demanded would decrease by 3%, leading to a decrease in total revenue.\n\nSo, to raise total revenue, they should decrease the price.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. decrease price as demand is elastic.\n\nB. decrease price as demand is inelastic.\n\nC. increase price as demand is elastic.\n\nD. increase price as demand is inelastic.\n\nGiven that demand is elastic (elasticity = 3), the correct choice should be A: decrease price as demand is elastic.\n\nBut let's make sure.\n\nOption B suggests decreasing price when demand is inelastic. But inelastic demand would require increasing price to raise total revenue, which contradicts the given elasticity value of 3.\n\nOption C suggests increasing price when demand is elastic, which, as per my earlier reasoning, would decrease total revenue.\n\nOption D suggests increasing price when demand is inelastic, which again doesn't align with the given elasticity of 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: decrease price as demand is elastic.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"to raise total revenue, owners should...\" and then gives four options. But according to my reasoning, only option A matches the situation where demand is elastic.\n\nHowever, I notice that the question is phrased a bit strangely. It says, \"to raise total revenue, owners should...,\" and then provides options that include statements about elasticity.\n\nBut based on the given elasticity value of 3, which is elastic, decreasing the price is indeed the way to raise total revenue.\n\nI think the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
