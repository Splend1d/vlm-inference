                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving a homeowner and a roofer, and there's some disagreement about a contract for roof repair. The homeowner tells the roofer that his roof leaks and thinks the tiles are cracked. He offers to pay $5,000 if the roofer replaces all the tiles. The roofer says, \"Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule,\" and the homeowner says, \"Okay, but let me know soon.\" Then, three days later, the roofer shows up with materials and equipment to do the job, and the homeowner sees this, runs outside, and says, \"Stop! The deal's off. I decided to repair the roof myself.\"\n\nNow, the question is about a potential breach of contract action by the roofer against the homeowner, and it's asking which theory of recovery would be the roofer's best approach. There are four options provided:\n\nA. A bilateral contract was formed when the roofer purchased the materials and equipment needed to do the job.\n\nB. A bilateral contract was formed when the roofer said, \"Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule.\"\n\nC. The homeowner made an offer that proposed a unilateral contract, and the offer became irrevocable when the roofer purchased the materials and equipment needed for the job.\n\nD. The homeowner made an offer that proposed a unilateral contract, and the roofer manifested an intent to accept the offer when he began performance by unloading the materials and equipment at the homeowner's house.\n\nAlright, so first things first, I need to understand the difference between bilateral and unilateral contracts and how they apply to this situation.\n\nA bilateral contract is one where there is an offer and an acceptance, resulting in mutual obligations. Typically, it involves a promise in exchange for a promise or performance.\n\nA unilateral contract, on the other hand, involves an offer that can be accepted by performing an act. The acceptance is completed by performing the act specified in the offer.\n\nIn this scenario, the homeowner offers to pay $5,000 if the roofer replaces all the tiles. So, the homeowner is making an offer that can be accepted by the roofer performing the act of replacing the tiles. This sounds more like a unilateral contract because the acceptance is through performance rather than just a promise to perform.\n\nBut wait, the roofer responds with, \"Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule.\" This seems like an acceptance of the offer, or at least an agreement to consider it, but with a condition about his schedule.\n\nThen the homeowner says, \"That's all right, but let me know soon.\" This seems like an acknowledgment that the roofer needs to check his schedule and will confirm later.\n\nThree days later, the roofer shows up with materials and equipment, indicating that he has started to perform the work, i.e., preparing to replace the tiles.\n\nAt this point, the homeowner changes his mind and says the deal's off, deciding to repair the roof himself.\n\nSo, the roofer has already incurred costs by purchasing materials and equipment, and has started to perform the work, but the homeowner has withdrawn the offer.\n\nNow, in terms of contract formation, was there a bilateral contract or a unilateral contract?\n\nOption A suggests that a bilateral contract was formed when the roofer purchased the materials and equipment.\n\nOption B suggests that a bilateral contract was formed when the roofer said, \"Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule.\"\n\nOption C suggests that the homeowner proposed a unilateral contract, and the offer became irrevocable when the roofer purchased the materials and equipment.\n\nOption D suggests that the homeowner proposed a unilateral contract, and the roofer manifested an intent to accept the offer when he began performance by unloading the materials and equipment.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, the homeowner makes an offer: \"If you replace all the tiles, I'll pay you $5,000.\"\n\nThis sounds like an offer that can be accepted by performing the act of replacing the tiles, which would make it a unilateral contract.\n\nBut then the roofer responds, \"Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule.\"\n\nThis response seems like an acceptance, but with a condition about his schedule. However, in contract law, acceptance needs to be unconditional unless otherwise agreed.\n\nSo, if the roofer had said, \"I accept,\" that would be clear acceptance, but here he's saying \"sure, if I can clear my busy schedule,\" which might be considered an acceptance subject to a condition.\n\nBut perhaps the roofer is agreeing to perform the work, subject to being able to fit it into his schedule. This could be seen as an acceptance with a condition, which might not be a valid acceptance unless the homeowner agrees to the condition.\n\nThen the homeowner says, \"That's all right, but let me know soon.\"\n\nThis could be interpreted as the homeowner agreeing to the roofer's condition about checking his schedule and expecting a confirmation soon.\n\nSo, perhaps they have an agreement where the roofer will confirm his availability to perform the job.\n\nThree days later, the roofer shows up with materials and equipment, indicating that he has confirmed his schedule and is proceeding with the job.\n\nAt this point, the homeowner changes his mind and cancels the deal.\n\nNow, if it's a unilateral contract, the offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance, which would be completion of performance. But if the roofer has already started performing and has relied on the offer, there might be implications.\n\nHowever, in some jurisdictions, once performance has begun under a unilateral contract, the offer cannot be revoked until performance is complete.\n\nAlternatively, if the roofer has reasonably relied on the offer to his detriment (by purchasing materials and equipment), there might be promissory estoppel considerations.\n\nBut the question is specifically about breach of contract, not promissory estoppel.\n\nLet me consider option C: The homeowner made an offer that proposed a unilateral contract, and the offer became irrevocable when the roofer purchased the materials and equipment needed for the job.\n\nIn unilateral contracts, generally, the offer can be revoked at any time before complete performance, unless there's a promise not to revoke or there's detrimental reliance.\n\nIf the roofer has purchased materials and equipment in reliance on the offer, and the homeowner knows or should know about this, then the offer might not be revocable under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.\n\nHowever, strictly speaking, in a unilateral contract, the acceptance is only complete upon full performance, not upon partial performance.\n\nOption D says that the homeowner made an offer proposing a unilateral contract, and the roofer manifested an intent to accept the offer when he began performance by unloading the materials and equipment at the homeowner's house.\n\nThis suggests that the roofer's actions in unloading the materials and equipment constitute partial performance, which might indicate an intent to accept the offer.\n\nBut in unilateral contracts, acceptance is generally only effective upon complete performance, not partial performance.\n\nHowever, some jurisdictions may recognize that partial performance under a unilateral contract can prevent revocation of the offer if it would be inequitable.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the roofer's best theory is that the homeowner made an offer for a unilateral contract, and by beginning performance, the roofer has manifested an intent to accept the offer, and the homeowner cannot now revoke the offer.\n\nAlternatively, option C suggests that the offer became irrevocable when the roofer purchased the materials and equipment.\n\nThis could be based on the idea that the roofer has taken steps in reliance on the offer, and it would be unfair for the homeowner to revoke it at that point.\n\nBut strictly speaking, in contract law, an offer for a unilateral contract is generally revocable until complete performance unless there's a separate promise not to revoke.\n\nHowever, if the roofer has relied on the offer to his detriment (purchasing materials and equipment), and the homeowner knew or should have known about this reliance, then the homeowner may be estopped from revoking the offer.\n\nSo, between options C and D, I need to decide which one better captures the roofer's best theory.\n\nOption C focuses on the irrevocability of the offer due to the roofer's purchase of materials and equipment.\n\nOption D focuses on the roofer's manifestation of intent to accept the offer by beginning performance.\n\nI think option D is stronger because it directly ties to the roofer's actions in beginning performance, which could be seen as an acceptance of the offer.\n\nOption C seems to rely more on the concept of irrevocability based on reliance, which is related but perhaps not as directly tied to the contract formation.\n\nMoreover, in some jurisdictions, once performance has begun under a unilateral contract, the offer cannot be revoked until performance is complete.\n\nTherefore, if the roofer has begun performance by unloading materials and equipment, and the homeowner cancels the deal at that point, the homeowner may be in breach of the unilateral contract.\n\nSo, in an action for breach of contract, the roofer's best theory would be that a unilateral contract was formed, and by beginning performance, the roofer has accepted the offer, and the homeowner cannot revoke the offer at that stage.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most accurate answer.\n\nOption A suggests that a bilateral contract was formed when the roofer purchased the materials and equipment.\n\nBut in a bilateral contract, acceptance is typically by a promise to perform, not by actual performance.\n\nHere, the roofer's purchase of materials and equipment seems more like preparation for performance rather than a promise to perform.\n\nOption B suggests that a bilateral contract was formed when the roofer said, \"Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule.\"\n\nBut this response seems conditional, and may not constitute a valid acceptance for a bilateral contract.\n\nOption C focuses on the irrevocability of the offer based on the roofer's purchase of materials and equipment, which aligns more with the concept of promissory estoppel rather than strict contract formation.\n\nOption D, on the other hand, directly ties to the roofer's actions in beginning performance, which is a key element in unilateral contracts.\n\nTherefore, I believe option D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
