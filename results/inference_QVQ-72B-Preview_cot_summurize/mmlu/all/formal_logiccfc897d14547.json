                    "text": "Let's tackle this logic problem. So, the statement is: \"Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar, but neither Janet nor Latoya did.\" And I need to translate this into predicate logic. There are four options provided, and I have to pick the best one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being said. Ms. Jackson lent me sugar, but Janet and Latoya did not lend me sugar. The key here is the \"neither...nor...\" construction, which indicates that both Janet and Latoya did not do something.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- \"Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar\": This is a positive statement about Ms. Jackson.\n\n- \"Neither Janet nor Latoya did\": This means both Janet and Latoya did not lend me sugar.\n\nIn logic terms, if I denote:\n\n- Lx: x lent me sugar.\n\nSo,\n\n- Lm: Ms. Jackson lent me sugar.\n\n- Lj: Janet lent me sugar.\n\n- Ll: Latoya lent me sugar.\n\nThe statement would be: Lm is true, and it's not the case that Lj or Ll is true. In other words, Lm is true, and both Lj and Ll are false.\n\nIn logical notation, this would be:\n\nLm \u2022 ~(Lj \u2228 Ll)\n\nWait, but the \"but\" in the original statement might suggest a conjunction, like \"A, but B\" meaning A and B, but sometimes \"but\" can also imply a contrast or an unexpected turn.\n\nHowever, in this context, \"Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar, but neither Janet nor Latoya did\" seems to be asserting that Ms. Jackson did lend sugar, and neither Janet nor Latoya did.\n\nSo, yes, that's Lm being true, and both Lj and Ll being false.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Lm \u2228 ~(Jl \u2228 Ll)\n\nThis is a disjunction: Lm or not (Lj or Ll). So, either Ms. Jackson lent sugar, or it's not the case that both Janet and Latoya lent sugar. But this doesn't capture the conjunction of Ms. Jackson lending sugar and neither Janet nor Latoya lending sugar.\n\nB. Lm \u2022 ~(Lj \u2022 Ll)\n\nThis has Lm and not (Lj and Ll). So, Ms. Jackson lent sugar, and it's not the case that both Janet and Latoya lent sugar. However, this allows for the possibility that one of them lent sugar, as long as not both did. But the original statement says \"neither Janet nor Latoya did,\" meaning both did not lend sugar, not just that not both lent sugar.\n\nC. Lm \u2022 ~(Lj \u2228 Ll)\n\nThis is Ms. Jackson lent sugar, and not (Janet lent sugar or Latoya lent sugar). This seems to match the original statement closely, as it requires that neither Janet nor Latoya lent sugar.\n\nD. Lm \u2228 ~(Lj \u2022 Ll)\n\nThis is similar to option A, a disjunction: Lm or not (Lj and Ll). Again, this doesn't capture the conjunction of Ms. Jackson lending sugar and neither Janet nor Latoya lending sugar.\n\nComparing options, C seems to be the closest match to the original statement.\n\nWait, but let's double-check.\n\nOption C: Lm \u2022 ~(Lj \u2228 Ll)\n\nThis means Ms. Jackson lent sugar, and it's not the case that Janet lent sugar or Latoya lent sugar. So, Ms. Jackson lent sugar, and neither Janet nor Latoya lent sugar. That matches exactly with the original statement.\n\nOption B: Lm \u2022 ~(Lj \u2022 Ll)\n\nThis means Ms. Jackson lent sugar, and it's not the case that both Janet and Latoya lent sugar. So, Ms. Jackson lent sugar, and at least one of them did not lend sugar. But the original statement says neither lent sugar, which is stronger than just not both lending sugar.\n\nFor example, if Janet lent sugar but Latoya did not, option B would be true, but the original statement would be false in that scenario because Janet did lend sugar.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct translation.\n\nI think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
