                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out which option is the most likely outcome. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a sculptor who owns a summer cottage on a small lake. To make it easier to get to the cottage, he makes an agreement with a neighbor. This neighbor owns land adjacent to the sculptor's property and agrees in writing to give the sculptor a right-of-way over a strip of land that's 30 feet wide and a quarter of a mile long, running along the eastern edge of the neighbor's property.\n\nSo, essentially, the neighbor is granting the sculptor an easement\u2014a right to use a part of the neighbor's land for access to his own property. This kind of arrangement is common when someone's property doesn't have direct access to a public road or path.\n\nAfter using this roadway for a year, the sculptor and his family move to Europe for business reasons. They haven't used the cottage for 11 years because of his job commitments there. During this time, the neighbor builds an access ramp to his dock, which blocks the road to the sculptor's cottage.\n\nNow, when the sculptor returns from Europe, he goes to his lakefront cottage and finds this obstructing ramp. He decides to sue his neighbor to force him to remove it. The question is, how would the court most likely rule in this case?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Hold in the neighbor's favor, because the sculptor's absence for 11 years constituted an abandonment of the easement.\n\nB. Hold in the neighbor's favor, because the dominant owner (the sculptor) is under an affirmative duty to notify the servient tenement holder (the neighbor) of non-use.\n\nC. Hold in the sculptor's favor, because mere non-use, however long continued, will not as a rule effectuate an abandonment.\n\nD. Hold in the sculptor's favor, because of the validity of the agreement for the express grant of the easement.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what abandonment means in this context. Abandonment typically requires not just non-use but also an intention to give up the right. So, just because the sculptor didn't use the easement for 11 years doesn't necessarily mean he intended to abandon it.\n\nOption A suggests that the sculptor's absence amounts to abandonment. But from the information given, it seems like the sculptor had a good reason for not using the easement\u2014he was living in Europe for work. There's no indication that he intended to give up his right to use the easement permanently.\n\nOption B says that the sculptor had an affirmative duty to notify the neighbor of his non-use. I'm not sure about that. Generally, once an easement is established, the dominant tenement (the sculptor) doesn't have to keep notifying the servient tenement (the neighbor) every time they use or don't use it. It's more about respecting the existing rights.\n\nOption C states that mere non-use, no matter how long, usually doesn't lead to abandonment. This seems aligned with what I know about easements. Abandonment requires both non-use and an intention to abandon, which is often hard to prove.\n\nOption D refers to the validity of the original agreement granting the easement. Since there was a written agreement, that suggests the easement is valid and enforceable unless there's a reason to invalidate it.\n\nGiven all this, it seems like options A and B are less likely because they assume that non-use alone can lead to abandonment or that there's a duty to notify, which isn't typically the case.\n\nBetween options C and D, both seem plausible, but option D seems stronger because it relies on the existence of a valid written agreement granting the easement. Even if there was non-use, as long as there was no intention to abandon, the easement should still be valid.\n\nWait a minute, maybe both C and D are relevant here. Option C is about the general principle that non-use doesn't equal abandonment, and option D is about the specific agreement that created the easement.\n\nPerhaps the court would consider both the principle and the specific agreement. But if I have to choose one that's most likely, I'd go with option D because it directly refers to the agreement that granted the easement.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose the neighbor argues that since the sculptor hasn't used the easement in 11 years, it's been abandoned. But as I said earlier, abandonment requires both non-use and intent to abandon, and there's no evidence of intent here. So, the sculptor can still enforce his easement rights.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the neighbor claims that the easement has been extinguished due to non-use. But again, that's generally not how easements work. They're considered appurtenant to the land and survive as long as the need exists, unless there's a specific legal process to terminate them.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the neighbor argues that the sculptor's failure to maintain the easement allows the neighbor to make changes to their property, like building the ramp. But generally, the servient tenement can't obstruct an easement without the dominant tenement's consent.\n\nIn summary, unless there's some local law that says otherwise, the sculptor's easement should still be valid, and the neighbor can't just block it with a ramp.\n\nTherefore, the court would most likely hold in the sculptor's favor, based on the validity of the original agreement for the express grant of the easement.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
