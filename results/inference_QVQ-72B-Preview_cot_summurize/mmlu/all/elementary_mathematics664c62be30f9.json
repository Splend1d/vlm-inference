                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: there are 393 players in a tournament, and each team has 3 players. I need to find out how many teams there are in total. The question is asking which expression to use to find this out, and there are four options:\n\nA. 393 + 3\n\nB. 393 \u2013 3\n\nC. 393 \u00d7 3\n\nD. 393 \u00f7 3\n\nAlright, let's think about this step by step. I need to figure out how many teams can be formed from 393 players when each team consists of 3 players.\n\nFirst, I should recall the basic arithmetic operations and what they represent.\n\nAddition (+) is used when you want to combine quantities.\n\nSubtraction (\u2013) is used to find the difference between quantities.\n\nMultiplication (\u00d7) is used to scale quantities or find the total when you have a certain number of groups.\n\nDivision (\u00f7) is used to split a quantity into equal parts or to find out how many groups can be made from a total quantity.\n\nIn this scenario, I have 393 players and I want to divide them into teams of 3 players each. So, I need to find out how many groups of 3 can be made from 393.\n\nThat sounds a lot like division. Specifically, I need to divide the total number of players by the number of players per team.\n\nSo, that would be 393 \u00f7 3.\n\nLet me double-check this with an example. Suppose there are 6 players and each team has 2 players. How many teams are there?\n\nWell, 6 \u00f7 2 = 3 teams.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Similarly, if there are 10 players and each team has 5 players, then 10 \u00f7 5 = 2 teams.\n\nSo, in the given problem, 393 \u00f7 3 should give me the number of teams.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options and see why they might not be correct.\n\nOption A: 393 + 3. This would be adding 3 to 393, which gives 396. But what does that represent? It doesn't seem to relate directly to the number of teams. It's just increasing the number of players by 3, which doesn't help in finding out how many teams there are.\n\nOption B: 393 \u2013 3. This subtracts 3 from 393, giving 390. Again, what does this represent? Subtracting 3 players doesn't directly give me the number of teams. It might be related to the total in some way, but not directly to the number of teams.\n\nOption C: 393 \u00d7 3. This multiplies the number of players by the number of players per team. So, 393 \u00d7 3 = 1179. What does this tell me? It seems like it's calculating the total number of players if each team had 3 players, but in reality, we have only 393 players. So, multiplying doesn't make sense in this context because I'm trying to find the number of teams, not the total number of players.\n\nOption D: 393 \u00f7 3. As I thought earlier, this divides the total number of players by the number of players per team, which should give me the number of teams.\n\nWait a minute, but I should consider if there's any remainder. In other words, does 3 divide evenly into 393?\n\nLet me check that: 3 \u00d7 131 = 393.\n\nYes, 393 \u00f7 3 = 131 with no remainder. So, there are 131 teams.\n\nBut the question isn't asking for the calculation result but rather which expression to use. So, even if there was a remainder, the correct expression would still be 393 \u00f7 3, as it's the division that represents the number of teams.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem involved incomplete teams or something, but that's not the case here.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression to find the number of teams is 393 \u00f7 3.\n\nJust to make sure, let's look back at the problem: \"A tournament has 393 players with 3 players on each team. Which expression shows how to find the number of teams in the tournament?\"\n\nClearly, dividing the total number of players by the number of players per team gives the number of teams.\n\nSo, the answer is D. 393 \u00f7 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
