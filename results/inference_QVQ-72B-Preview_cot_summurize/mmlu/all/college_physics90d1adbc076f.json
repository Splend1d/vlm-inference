                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"The speed of light inside of a nonmagnetic dielectric material with a dielectric constant of 4.0 is...\" and then there are four options. Okay, I need to find the speed of light in this material given its dielectric constant. I remember that the speed of light in a medium is related to the dielectric constant and possibly the magnetic permeability since it's mentioned that it's a nonmagnetic material.\n\nFirst, I know that the speed of light in a vacuum is c = 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. In a medium, the speed of light is generally less than c, and it's given by v = c / n, where n is the refractive index of the medium. But here, instead of the refractive index, I'm given the dielectric constant.\n\nI recall that the dielectric constant, often denoted by \u03ba (kappa), is related to the permittivity of the medium. Specifically, \u03ba = \u03b5 / \u03b5\u2080, where \u03b5 is the permittivity of the medium and \u03b5\u2080 is the permittivity of free space.\n\nAlso, the refractive index n is related to the relative permittivity and relative permeability by n = \u221a(\u03b5_r \u03bc_r), where \u03b5_r is the relative permittivity and \u03bc_r is the relative permeability.\n\nGiven that the material is nonmagnetic, \u03bc_r = 1. So, n = \u221a\u03b5_r.\n\nIn this problem, the dielectric constant is given as 4.0. I think dielectric constant is the same as relative permittivity, so \u03b5_r = 4.0.\n\nTherefore, n = \u221a4 = 2.\n\nSo, the speed of light in the medium should be v = c / n = 3.0 x 10^8 m/s / 2 = 1.5 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nLooking at the options, C. 1.5 x 10^8 m/s seems to be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is the dielectric constant indeed equal to the relative permittivity? Yes, I believe so. And is the refractive index correctly calculated as the square root of the relative permittivity when relative permeability is 1? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, I know that the speed of light in a medium is also given by v = c / \u221a\u03b5_r \u03bc_r, and since \u03bc_r = 1, it simplifies to v = c / \u221a\u03b5_r.\n\nGiven \u03b5_r = 4, v = c / 2 = 1.5 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nSo, I think option C is correct.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should consider if there's any other factor that could affect the speed of light in the medium. For example, is the material magnetic? No, it's specified as nonmagnetic, so \u03bc_r = 1.\n\nIs there any frequency dependence or anything like that? No, the problem seems to be in the context of electromagnetic waves in a linear, isotropic, nonmagnetic dielectric material.\n\nTherefore, the speed of light inside such a material with a dielectric constant of 4.0 should indeed be 1.5 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 1.5 x 10^8 m/s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
