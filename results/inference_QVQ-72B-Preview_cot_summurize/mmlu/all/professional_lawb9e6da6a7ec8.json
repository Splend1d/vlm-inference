                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a potential contract between a man and a mechanic for car repairs. The man sent a letter on February 1 offering to pay $275 if the mechanic would change the oil, replace the oil filter, and adjust the carburetors by February 10. The mechanic received the letter on February 3 and immediately ordered the necessary materials from an auto supply company. Then, on February 5, at a party, the man tells the mechanic to disregard the letter because he sold his car the day before. The mechanic says he already ordered the materials, and the man apologizes but insists on forgetting the repair work.\n\nNow, if the mechanic decides to sue for breach of contract, I need to figure out which of the given options is the man's strongest argument against the existence of an enforceable contract.\n\nLet's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the elements of a contract. Generally, a contract requires an offer, an acceptance of that offer, consideration, and mutual assent.\n\nThe man made an offer in his letter, specifying the work to be done and the payment amount. The mechanic received this offer on February 3 and seemed to have taken steps to prepare for the job by ordering materials on the same day.\n\nHowever, before the mechanic could formally accept the offer, the man revoked it on February 5 at the party, saying to disregard the letter because he had sold the car.\n\nNow, the question is whether an enforceable contract was formed between them, and if not, what is the man's strongest argument against it.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. The mechanic had not completed performance before the man revoked his offer.\n\nSo, the mechanic hadn't finished the job yet when the man revoked the offer. But does that matter? In contract law, generally, acceptance needs to be communicated to the offeror before revocation. Ordering materials might be seen as part of the performance, but perhaps not full performance. However, in many cases, acceptance can be implied by beginning performance.\n\nBut maybe the man is arguing that since the mechanic hadn't fully performed the job, the offer could still be revoked.\n\nWait, but generally, once acceptance is communicated or performance begins, revocation is no longer possible.\n\nI need to think more about this.\n\nB. The man's offer could only be accepted by a return promise.\n\nHmm, what does this mean? Is the man saying that the mechanic needed to make a counter-offer or promise to do the work in return?\n\nIn contract law, acceptance can be by a promise or by performance, depending on the terms of the offer.\n\nThe man's letter seems to invite acceptance by performance: do the specified work by February 10, and you'll be paid $275.\n\nSo, unless the offer required a specific mode of acceptance, accepting by beginning performance might be sufficient.\n\nBut maybe the man is arguing that only a return promise is acceptable, not performance.\n\nI'm not sure about that. Need to think more.\n\nC. Because the man made his offer by letter, the mechanic could accept only in the same manner.\n\nThis seems like an argument based on the mode of acceptance. Is there a requirement that acceptance must be in the same manner as the offer?\n\nIn general contract law, unless specified otherwise, acceptance can be communicated by any reasonable means. So, if the offer doesn't specify how to accept, accepting orally at the party might be sufficient.\n\nBut in this case, perhaps the man is arguing that since the offer was in writing (a letter), acceptance should also be in writing.\n\nHowever, I think that unless specified, acceptance doesn't need to be in the same form as the offer.\n\nD. Although the mechanic was preparing to perform the repair work, he had not begun the requested acts of acceptance when the man revoked his offer.\n\nThis seems similar to option A. The man is arguing that since the mechanic hadn't started the actual repair work, the offer could still be revoked.\n\nBut the mechanic had ordered materials, which could be seen as beginning performance.\n\nIn cases where acceptance is by performance, starting to perform can be seen as acceptance.\n\nSo, maybe the man is arguing that ordering materials isn't enough to constitute acceptance.\n\nI need to consider what constitutes acceptance by performance.\n\nAlright, let's try to analyze this better.\n\nFirst, the man made an offer in a letter, which was received by the mechanic on February 3.\n\nThe mechanic ordered materials on February 3, same day he received the offer.\n\nThen, on February 5, the man revoked the offer at a party.\n\nThe question is whether the mechanic had accepted the offer before the revocation.\n\nAcceptance can be by promise or by performance.\n\nIf the offer invites acceptance by performance, then beginning performance can constitute acceptance.\n\nIn this case, the offer was to do specific work (change oil, replace filter, adjust carburetors) by February 10 in exchange for $275.\n\nThe mechanic ordered materials on February 3, which could be seen as preparing to perform the work.\n\nIs preparing to perform the work sufficient for acceptance, or does actual performance need to start?\n\nI think ordering materials is a step towards performance and could be seen as acceptance.\n\nHowever, perhaps the man is arguing that this is merely preparation and not actual performance.\n\nBut in many cases, preparing to perform can be seen as acceptance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mechanic needed to communicate acceptance before starting performance.\n\nBut in offers where performance is the acceptance, communication might not be necessary.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should look at the timing.\n\nThe offer was made on February 1, received on February 3.\n\nThe mechanic ordered materials on February 3.\n\nRevocation happened on February 5.\n\nIf the mechanic had accepted the offer by ordering materials on February 3, then the revocation on February 5 would be ineffective because acceptance had already occurred.\n\nBut did the mechanic's action of ordering materials constitute acceptance?\n\nProbably, yes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mechanic needed to communicate acceptance before performing.\n\nBut in general, when an offer invites acceptance by performance, performing the act constitutes acceptance.\n\nSo, ordering materials could be seen as part of the performance, hence acceptance.\n\nTherefore, the revocation on February 5 was after acceptance, making it invalid.\n\nSo, the man's arguments A and D seem weak because they suggest that since performance wasn't fully completed, revocation was possible.\n\nBut that's not how it works. Once acceptance occurs, the offer can't be revoked.\n\nOption B suggests that only a return promise was acceptable, not performance.\n\nBut the offer clearly invited acceptance by performance: do the work, get paid.\n\nSo, that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C says that because the offer was by letter, acceptance must be in the same manner.\n\nBut generally, acceptance can be by any means unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, accepting orally at the party might be sufficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the man's strongest argument is D: that the mechanic hadn't begun the requested acts of acceptance when the man revoked his offer.\n\nBut even then, I think ordering materials could be seen as beginning performance, hence acceptance.\n\nSo, perhaps D isn't that strong either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the man can argue that ordering materials isn't sufficient performance to constitute acceptance, as no actual work has been done yet.\n\nBut that seems like a stretch.\n\nI think the best answer among the given options is D, but I'm not entirely convinced that it's the strongest argument.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the mechanic hadn't communicated acceptance, and the man thought the offer was still open.\n\nBut again, if acceptance can be by performance, and the mechanic started performing, communication might not be necessary.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nPerhaps the man's strongest argument is that the mechanic hadn't fully performed the work, so the offer could still be revoked.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right because partial performance can constitute acceptance.\n\nI think the answer is D, but I'm still unsure.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about it differently.\n\nPerhaps the man can argue that ordering materials isn't a substantial enough step to constitute acceptance.\n\nAfter all, the mechanic might have ordered the wrong materials or something.\n\nBut that seems weak.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the man can argue that the mechanic hadn't yet started the actual repair work, so revocation was possible.\n\nBut again, preparing to perform could be seen as acceptance.\n\nI think the man's best argument is that the mechanic hadn't fully performed the work, so revocation was possible.\n\nBut I don't think that holds up well in contract law.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the man can argue that the offer was revocable before acceptance, and since acceptance hadn't been communicated, revocation was valid.\n\nBut if acceptance was by performance, and performance had begun, then revocation is invalid.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me see if I can find a principle here.\n\nIn contract law, an offer can be revoked any time before acceptance.\n\nAcceptance can be by promise or by performance.\n\nIf acceptance is by performance, beginning performance can constitute acceptance.\n\nIn this case, the mechanic began performance by ordering materials.\n\nTherefore, acceptance had occurred before the revocation on February 5.\n\nThus, the revocation was\u65e0\u6548 because acceptance had already occurred.\n\nTherefore, the man's argument that the mechanic hadn't begun the requested acts of acceptance when the offer was revoked is not strong.\n\nSo, perhaps none of the options are correct, or perhaps D is the closest, but it's not a strong argument.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the man can argue that ordering materials isn't part of the performance required by the offer.\n\nThe offer was to change the oil, replace the filter, and adjust the carburetors.\n\nOrdering materials might be preparatory, but not part of the actual work.\n\nSo, perhaps the mechanic hadn't begun the \"requested acts of acceptance,\" meaning the actual repair work.\n\nIf that's the case, then the man could argue that since the mechanic hadn't started the actual repair work, the offer could still be revoked.\n\nBut even then, ordering materials could be seen as a step towards performance, implying acceptance.\n\nI think the man's argument under D is somewhat weak, but it's probably the strongest among the given options.\n\nSo, I'll go with D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
