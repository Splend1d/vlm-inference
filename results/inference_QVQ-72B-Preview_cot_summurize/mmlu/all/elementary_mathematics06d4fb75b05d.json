                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that an ice cream shop sold 48 vanilla milkshakes in a day, and that was 40% of the total number of milkshakes sold that day. I need to find out the total number of milkshakes sold that day. The options are 60, 72, 100, and 120.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what's being asked. If 48 vanilla milkshakes represent 40% of the total milkshakes sold, then I need to find the full total of milkshakes. So, 48 is 40% of the total.\n\nFirst, I can set up an equation to represent this situation. Let's let the total number of milkshakes be T. Then, 40% of T is equal to 48. In mathematical terms, that's 0.40 * T = 48.\n\nI need to solve for T. To do that, I can divide both sides of the equation by 0.40.\n\nSo, T = 48 / 0.40.\n\nLet me calculate that. 48 divided by 0.40.\n\nWell, 0.40 is the same as 4/10, and 48 divided by 4 is 12, but that doesn't make sense because if 40% is 48, then 100% should be larger, not smaller.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it differently. Perhaps use fractions instead of decimals.\n\n40% is 40/100, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nSo, 2/5 of T is equal to 48.\n\nThat might be easier for some people. Now, to find T, I can set up the equation:\n\n(2/5) * T = 48.\n\nTo solve for T, I can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 2/5, which is 5/2.\n\nSo, T = 48 * (5/2).\n\nLet me compute that. 48 times 5 is 240, and 240 divided by 2 is 120.\n\nSo, T = 120.\n\nWait a minute, but looking back at the options, 120 is one of them. But let's double-check if this makes sense.\n\nIf the total number of milkshakes is 120, then 40% of 120 should be 48.\n\nLet me verify that. 40% of 120 is 0.40 * 120 = 48, which matches the given information.\n\nSo, the answer seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check the other options to see why they might be incorrect.\n\nOption A is 60. If total milkshakes were 60, 40% of 60 is 24, which is not equal to 48. So, this can't be right.\n\nOption B is 72. 40% of 72 is 0.40 * 72 = 28.8, which is not 48. So, not correct.\n\nOption C is 100. 40% of 100 is 40, which is less than 48. So, also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only option that fits the given information is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to approach this without using algebra, I could think in terms of proportions.\n\nIf 48 is 40% of the total, then 100% would be how much?\n\nWell, 40% corresponds to 48, so 1% would be 48 divided by 40, which is 1.2.\n\nThen, 100% would be 1.2 times 100, which is 120.\n\nAgain, leading to the same answer of 120.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to set up a proportion:\n\n48 / T = 40 / 100\n\nCross-multiplying gives: 48 * 100 = 40 * T\n\nThen, T = (48 * 100) / 40 = 120.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I arrive at the same answer of 120.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 120.\n\nJust to make sure there are no mistakes, let me consider if there's any other factor that could affect this calculation.\n\nIs there any possibility of other milkshake types affecting the total? The problem states that 48 vanilla milkshakes were sold, which was 40% of the total milkshakes sold that day. So, no, I don't think there are other factors involved.\n\nAlso, the question specifies that it's for one day, so no need to consider multiple days.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all possible angles here, and each method confirms that the total number of milkshakes sold that day was 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
