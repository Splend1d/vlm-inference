                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to write the number 270,240 in expanded form. Expanded form is where you break down a number into the value of each digit, right? So, for example, the number 345 would be 300 + 40 + 5. Got it.\n\nNow, 270,240 seems like a bit bigger number, but the principle should be the same. Let's look at the options given:\n\nA. 200,000 + 7,000 + 200 + 4\n\nB. 200,000 + 7,000 + 200 + 40\n\nC. 200,000 + 70,000 + 200 + 40\n\nD. 200,000 + 70,000 + 2,000 + 40\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what each digit in 270,240 represents.\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n- The first digit is 2, which is in the hundred-thousands place. So, that's 200,000.\n\n- The next digit is 7, which is in the ten-thousands place. So, that's 70,000.\n\n- The next digit is 0, which is in the thousands place. So, that's 0, but since it's zero, it doesn't add anything.\n\n- The next digit is 2, which is in the hundreds place. So, that's 200.\n\n- The next digit is 4, which is in the tens place. So, that's 40.\n\n- The last digit is 0, which is in the ones place. So, that's 0.\n\nWait a minute, the number is 270,240, but looking at the digits, the ten-thousands digit is 7, so it should be 70,000, not 7,000. So, options A and B have 7,000, which is incorrect because 7 is in the ten-thousands place, not the thousands place.\n\nOption C has 200,000 + 70,000 + 200 + 40, which seems correct based on my breakdown.\n\nOption D has 200,000 + 70,000 + 2,000 + 40. Wait, but the thousands place is 0, so it should be 0, not 2,000. But according to my earlier breakdown, it's 2 in the hundreds place, which is 200, not 2,000.\n\nSo, option D has an extra 2,000, which shouldn't be there because the thousands place is 0.\n\nOption C has 200,000 + 70,000 + 200 + 40, which matches my breakdown.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n200,000 (from the 2 in the hundred-thousands place)\n\nPlus 70,000 (from the 7 in the ten-thousands place)\n\nPlus 200 (from the 2 in the hundreds place)\n\nPlus 40 (from the 4 in the tens place)\n\nAnd the 0's in the thousands and ones places don't add anything.\n\nSo, adding those up: 200,000 + 70,000 = 270,000; plus 200 is 270,200; plus 40 is 270,240. Perfect, that matches the original number.\n\nOption A had 200,000 + 7,000 + 200 + 4, which would be 207,204, which is not equal to 270,240.\n\nOption B is the same as option A, just with a different last term: 200,000 + 7,000 + 200 + 40 = 207,240, still not equal to 270,240.\n\nOption D has 200,000 + 70,000 + 2,000 + 40, which is 272,040, which is also not equal to 270,240.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: 200,000 + 70,000 + 200 + 40.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in that reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
