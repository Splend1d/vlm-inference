                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about standard scores, or z-scores, as I think they're more commonly known. It says that students in an AP Statistics class were timed in seconds while solving some math brainteasers, and one student's time had a standardized score of z equals 2.40. Then, if all the times are changed to minutes, what will the student's standardized score be? The options are z equals 0.04, 0.4, 1.80, or 2.40.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall what a z-score is. I know that a z-score measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. The formula for z-score is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(x - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( x \\) is the data point,\n\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean of the dataset,\n\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation of the dataset.\n\nSo, in this case, the student's time was measured in seconds, and their z-score is 2.40. Now, all times are changed to minutes. That means that every time, including the student's, the mean, and probably the standard deviation, will be converted from seconds to minutes.\n\nSince there are 60 seconds in a minute, converting seconds to minutes involves dividing by 60. So, if \\( x \\) is the original time in seconds, then the new time in minutes is \\( x / 60 \\).\n\nSimilarly, the mean \\( \\mu \\) in minutes would be \\( \\mu / 60 \\), and the standard deviation \\( \\sigma \\) in minutes would be \\( \\sigma / 60 \\).\n\nSo, the new z-score would be:\n\n\\[ z_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{(x / 60 - \\mu / 60)}{\\sigma / 60} \\]\n\nI can factor out the 1/60 from both the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[ z_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{1/60 (x - \\mu)}{1/60 \\sigma} = \\frac{(x - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nWait a minute, that's just the original z-score! So, z_{\\text{new}} equals z, which is 2.40.\n\nBut let me double-check this. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nI know that z-scores are dimensionless; they measure the number of standard deviations away from the mean, regardless of the units. So, whether you're in seconds or minutes, the relative position of the data point to the mean in terms of standard deviations shouldn't change.\n\nBut in this problem, all times are changed to minutes, including the student's time, the mean, and the standard deviation. Since all these values are divided by 60 to convert to minutes, the z-score should remain the same.\n\nLet me try plugging in some numbers to see if this makes sense.\n\nSuppose the original time \\( x \\) is, say, 120 seconds, the mean \\( \\mu \\) is 100 seconds, and the standard deviation \\( \\sigma \\) is 20 seconds.\n\nThen, the original z-score is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{120 - 100}{20} = \\frac{20}{20} = 1 \\]\n\nNow, converting to minutes:\n\n\\( x = 120 / 60 = 2 \\) minutes,\n\n\\( \\mu = 100 / 60 \\approx 1.6667 \\) minutes,\n\n\\( \\sigma = 20 / 60 \\approx 0.3333 \\) minutes.\n\nThen, the z-score in minutes is:\n\n\\[ z_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{2 - 1.6667}{0.3333} \\approx \\frac{0.3333}{0.3333} = 1 \\]\n\nSo, indeed, the z-score remains the same.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the original z-score is given as 2.40, and the question is what the new z-score would be after converting to minutes. According to this, it should still be 2.40.\n\nBut the answer options include z = 0.04, z = 0.4, z = 1.80, and z = 2.40. So, if my reasoning is correct, the answer should be z = 2.40.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing. Perhaps the mean and standard deviation aren't being converted when changing units.\n\nLet me consider that possibility.\n\nIf only the student's time is converted to minutes, but the mean and standard deviation remain in seconds, then the z-score calculation would be:\n\n\\[ z_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{(x / 60 - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nWhere \\( x \\) is now in minutes, but \\( \\mu \\) and \\( \\sigma \\) are still in seconds.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ z_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{x / 60 - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{x - 60 \\mu}{60 \\sigma} \\]\n\nThis seems off because it introduces 60 into the denominator, which would change the z-score.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if only the student's time is converted to minutes, but the mean and standard deviation are still in seconds, then yes, the z-score would change.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose that when all times are changed to minutes, both the data points and the mean and standard deviation are converted to minutes.\n\nIn that case, as I calculated earlier, the z-score remains the same.\n\nBut if only the student's time is converted to minutes, while the mean and standard deviation remain in seconds, then the z-score would change.\n\nBut the problem says \"all times are changed to minutes,\" which suggests that both the data points and the summary statistics (mean and standard deviation) are converted to minutes.\n\nTherefore, the z-score should remain unchanged.\n\nBut let me check another example to confirm.\n\nLet's say \\( x = 180 \\) seconds, \\( \\mu = 150 \\) seconds, \\( \\sigma = 30 \\) seconds.\n\nOriginal z-score:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{180 - 150}{30} = \\frac{30}{30} = 1 \\]\n\nNow, convert to minutes:\n\n\\( x = 180 / 60 = 3 \\) minutes,\n\n\\( \\mu = 150 / 60 = 2.5 \\) minutes,\n\n\\( \\sigma = 30 / 60 = 0.5 \\) minutes.\n\nNew z-score:\n\n\\[ z_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{3 - 2.5}{0.5} = \\frac{0.5}{0.5} = 1 \\]\n\nAgain, the z-score remains the same.\n\nThis reinforces my initial conclusion that the z-score doesn't change when units are converted, provided that both the data and the summary statistics are converted consistently.\n\nTherefore, the student's standardized score after converting to minutes should still be z = 2.40.\n\nBut the problem might be trying to trick me by implying that since seconds are converted to minutes by dividing by 60, the z-score should be divided by 60 or something like that.\n\nHowever, based on my calculations and examples, that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the z-score scales with the units. For example, if time is in minutes, which are larger units than seconds, perhaps the z-score is scaled accordingly.\n\nBut no, z-scores are unitless measures, so they shouldn't change with unit conversion.\n\nI think the correct answer is z = 2.40.\n\nLooking back at the options, z = 2.40 is one of them, so I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
