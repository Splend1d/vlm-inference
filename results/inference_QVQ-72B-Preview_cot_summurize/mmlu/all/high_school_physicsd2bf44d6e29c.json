                    "text": "So here's this problem: a stone is thrown horizontally with an initial speed of 30 m/s from a bridge, and it hits the water 4 seconds later. We're supposed to find the stone's total speed when it enters the water, assuming negligible air resistance. The options are 30 m/s, 40 m/s, 50 m/s, and 60 m/s.\n\nAlright, first things first, let's visualize what's happening. The stone is thrown horizontally, so its initial velocity is only in the horizontal direction, right? And since it's being thrown from a bridge, it's also falling vertically due to gravity.\n\nSo, this is a typical projectile motion problem. The stone has both horizontal and vertical components of velocity when it hits the water.\n\nI remember that in projectile motion, the horizontal and vertical motions are independent of each other, especially if we ignore air resistance. That means the horizontal velocity remains constant, and the vertical velocity increases due to gravity.\n\nGiven that, the horizontal velocity (v_x) is constant and equals the initial speed, which is 30 m/s.\n\nNow, I need to find the vertical velocity (v_y) when the stone hits the water. Since it's falling freely under gravity, I can use the equation:\n\nv_y = g * t\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2), and t is the time of flight, which is 4 seconds.\n\nSo, v_y = 9.81 m/s\u00b2 * 4 s = 39.24 m/s\n\nNow, the total velocity when it hits the water is the vector sum of the horizontal and vertical velocities. So, I can use the Pythagorean theorem here because these velocities are perpendicular to each other.\n\nTotal speed (v_total) = sqrt(v_x\u00b2 + v_y\u00b2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nv_total = sqrt((30 m/s)\u00b2 + (39.24 m/s)\u00b2) = sqrt(900 + 1539.62) = sqrt(2439.62) \u2248 49.4 m/s\n\nLooking back at the options, 49.4 m/s is closest to 50 m/s, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there's any trick here. The problem says \"assuming that air resistance is negligible,\" so I think my approach is correct. Also, the initial velocity is horizontal, and gravity acts vertically, so they don't affect each other directly.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it. Maybe using conservation of energy. The stone has kinetic energy initially, and as it falls, it gains potential energy converted to kinetic energy.\n\nInitial kinetic energy (E_ki) = (1/2)mv_x\u00b2\n\nFinal kinetic energy (E_kf) = (1/2)mv_x\u00b2 + (1/2)mv_y\u00b2\n\nBut since mass cancels out, this is similar to what I did before.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the vertical displacement using the time and the free-fall equation, but I don't think that's necessary here.\n\nWait, no, actually, I don't need the vertical displacement for this problem. I just need the velocities.\n\nAnother thought: since the horizontal and vertical motions are independent, and horizontal velocity is constant, and vertical velocity increases linearly with time due to constant acceleration, my initial calculation should be correct.\n\nPerhaps I should consider significant figures. The initial speed is given as 30 m/s, which has two significant figures, but g is approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2. If I use g = 9.8 m/s\u00b2 for simplicity, then v_y = 9.8 m/s\u00b2 * 4 s = 39.2 m/s\n\nThen, v_total = sqrt(30\u00b2 + 39.2\u00b2) = sqrt(900 + 1536.64) = sqrt(2436.64) \u2248 49.4 m/s\n\nStill, closest to 50 m/s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use g = 10 m/s\u00b2 for simpler calculations.\n\nIf g = 10 m/s\u00b2, then v_y = 10 m/s\u00b2 * 4 s = 40 m/s\n\nThen, v_total = sqrt(30\u00b2 + 40\u00b2) = sqrt(900 + 1600) = sqrt(2500) = 50 m/s\n\nExactly 50 m/s, which matches option C.\n\nSo, whether I use g = 9.81 m/s\u00b2 or g = 10 m/s\u00b2, I get v_total \u2248 49.4 m/s or exactly 50 m/s. Given that the options are in whole numbers, it's reasonable to use g = 10 m/s\u00b2 and get 50 m/s.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 50 m/s, option C.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect the total speed. For example, the height from which the stone is dropped, but that's already determined by the time of flight, which is given.\n\nAlso, the horizontal velocity remains constant because there's no horizontal acceleration, and the vertical velocity increases due to gravity, which is acting only downward.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is 50 m/s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50\\ \\text{m/s}} \\]"
