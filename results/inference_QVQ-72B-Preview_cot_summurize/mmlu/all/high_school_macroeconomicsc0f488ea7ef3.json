                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand how expansionary fiscal policy works and what might lessen its impact. Expansionary fiscal policy is when the government increases spending or cuts taxes to stimulate the economy, right? That should boost aggregate demand and hopefully increase output and employment.\n\nNow, the question is asking about factors that lessen the impact of this policy. So, I need to think about things that might\u62b5\u6d88 or reduce the intended effects of increased government spending or tax cuts.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\n**Option A: An increase in the marginal propensity to consume (MPC).**\n\nThe MPC is the proportion of additional income that households spend rather than save. If the MPC increases, that means people are spending a larger portion of any extra income they receive. In the context of expansionary fiscal policy, if the government cuts taxes, people have more disposable income. If they spend more of that extra income (higher MPC), that should actually amplify the stimulative effect on the economy. So, this seems like it would enhance the impact of fiscal policy, not lessen it.\n\n**Option B: Lower interest rates that cause a decrease in net exports.**\n\nExpansionary fiscal policy can lead to increased aggregate demand, which might push up interest rates if the central bank keeps the money supply constant. However, if interest rates decrease due to some reason, that could affect net exports. Lower interest rates can make a country's currency less attractive to foreign investors, potentially leading to a depreciation of the currency. A depreciated currency can make exports cheaper and imports more expensive, which would increase net exports. But this option says lower interest rates cause a decrease in net exports, which seems counterintuitive. Maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. If lower interest rates lead to a decrease in net exports, that could offset some of the expansionary effects of fiscal policy. For example, if lower interest rates cause the currency to depreciate, making imports more expensive, that could lead to a decrease in consumption of imports, which might not necessarily decrease net exports immediately, but if imports decrease more than exports increase, net exports could decrease. However, generally, depreciation is expected to improve net exports. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\n**Option C: Higher interest rates that cause an increase in net exports.**\n\nThis seems similar to option B but in reverse. Higher interest rates can attract foreign capital, leading to an appreciation of the currency. An appreciated currency makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper, which would typically lead to a decrease in net exports. So, if higher interest rates lead to increased net exports, that doesn't align with standard economic theory. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that higher interest rates lead to increased net exports, which would add to aggregate demand, thereby reinforcing the expansionary fiscal policy. But according to standard theory, higher interest rates should lead to a stronger currency and thus decreased net exports. So, if higher interest rates cause increased net exports, that would actually enhance the fiscal policy's impact, not lessen it.\n\n**Option D: Higher interest rates that decrease private investment.**\n\nThis seems plausible. One of the potential side effects of expansionary fiscal policy is that it can lead to increased aggregate demand, which might push up interest rates if the money supply doesn't increase proportionally. Higher interest rates can then make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, leading to decreased investment and consumption. This is sometimes referred to as \"crowding out,\" where increased government spending crowds out private sector spending.\n\nSo, if higher interest rates lead to decreased private investment, that would indeed lessen the overall impact of the expansionary fiscal policy because part of the increased demand from government spending is offset by decreased demand from private investment.\n\nGiven this, option D seems like the most likely answer.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\n- Option A suggests that an increase in MPC would actually enhance the multiplier effect of fiscal policy, making it more effective, not less.\n\n- Option B and C have to do with net exports, and while changes in net exports can affect aggregate demand, the relationships described in B and C don't align with standard economic theory.\n\n- Option D directly describes the process of crowding out, which is a well-known phenomenon where expansionary fiscal policy leads to higher interest rates, which in turn reduce private investment, lessening the overall impact of the policy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D: Higher interest rates that decrease private investment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
