                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario involving two drivers who got into an accident and both filed lawsuits against each other for negligence. The jury found both drivers liable for negligence, with each being assigned 50% fault for the accident. The truck driver had $10,000 in injuries, and the car driver had $8,000 in injuries. There's a statute in play that talks about contributory negligence not barring recovery unless the negligence of the person seeking recovery was greater than that of the defendant. Also, any damages awarded should be reduced in proportion to the negligence of the plaintiff.\n\nAlright, so first, I need to understand what contributory negligence and comparative negligence are because the statute seems to be a mix of both concepts. Traditionally, contributory negligence means that if the plaintiff is at all negligent, they can't recover any damages. But this statute says that contributory negligence doesn't bar recovery as long as the plaintiff's negligence wasn't greater than the defendant's. That sounds more like a comparative negligence approach, where damages are apportioned based on fault.\n\nSo, in this jurisdiction, even if the plaintiff is negligent, they can still recover damages as long as their negligence isn't greater than the defendant's. And the damages are diminished according to the plaintiff's degree of fault.\n\nGiven that, let's look at each driver's situation.\n\nFirst, the truck driver is suing the car driver. The truck driver has $10,000 in injuries, and the jury assigned 50% fault to each driver. So, according to the statute, since the truck driver's negligence (50%) is equal to the car driver's negligence (50%), and not greater, the truck driver can recover damages. But the damages have to be diminished by the truck driver's percentage of fault.\n\nSo, the truck driver's recovery would be $10,000 minus 50% (their fault percentage), which is $10,000 * (1 - 0.50) = $5,000.\n\nSimilarly, the car driver is suing the truck driver. The car driver has $8,000 in injuries, and their fault is also 50%. Since their negligence is equal to the truck driver's negligence, they can also recover, but again, the damages are reduced by their own fault percentage.\n\nSo, the car driver's recovery would be $8,000 minus 50% of their own fault, which is $8,000 * (1 - 0.50) = $4,000.\n\nTherefore, both drivers can recover, but their recoveries are reduced by their own fault percentages.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. The truck driver recovers $10,000, and the car driver recovers $8,000.\n\nThis is incorrect because both should have their recoveries reduced by their own 50% fault.\n\nB. The truck driver recovers $5,000, and the car driver recovers $4,000.\n\nThis seems correct based on the calculations above.\n\nC. The truck driver recovers $1,000, and the car driver recovers nothing.\n\nThis doesn't make sense. Why would the truck driver only get $1,000 and the car driver nothing? Both have equal fault and should have their recoveries reduced equally based on their fault.\n\nD. Neither party recovers anything from the other.\n\nThis is incorrect because the statute allows recovery as long as the plaintiff's negligence isn't greater than the defendant's, which in this case, it's equal.\n\nSo, option B seems to be the correct one.\n\nWait a minute, is there something I'm missing here? Let me double-check.\n\nIn some jurisdictions with comparative negligence, when the plaintiff's fault equals the defendant's, they still allow recovery but reduce it by the plaintiff's fault percentage. That seems to align with the statute provided.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes, if both parties are equally at fault, their claims might offset each other, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nAlso, considering that both are suing each other, and their faults are equal, it's likely that each would recover from the other, but their recoveries would be reduced by their own fault percentages.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the correct answer is B: The truck driver recovers $5,000, and the car driver recovers $4,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
