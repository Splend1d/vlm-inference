                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about two different scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. In Scenario 1, it says, \"There were signs saying not to wear sunscreen in the hot springs so I didn't wear any.\" So, there are signs prohibiting the use of sunscreen in the hot springs, and the person complied with those signs by not wearing any sunscreen. That seems straightforward.\n\nIn Scenario 2, it says, \"I pointed out the man in the airport to security because I thought he might have a weapon.\" Here, the person saw someone who they suspected might be carrying a weapon and decided to alert security about it.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate whether either of these actions is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1. The person didn't wear sunscreen in the hot springs because there were signs saying not to. Is this morally wrong? Well, moral wrongs usually involve harming others or violating some ethical principle. Not wearing sunscreen in hot springs, especially when there are signs prohibiting it, might be against rules or regulations, but is it morally wrong?\n\nI think this is more about following rules and regulations rather than a moral issue. The signs say not to wear sunscreen, so not wearing it is adhering to those signs. Unless there's some harm caused by not wearing sunscreen, which isn't mentioned here, I don't see this as a moral wrong. It seems more like following instructions or regulations for maintaining the hot springs.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2. The person saw someone who they thought might have a weapon and decided to report it to security. Is this morally wrong? Again, considering ordinary moral standards in the US, reporting a potential threat to authorities is generally seen as a responsible action, especially in a public place like an airport where security is crucial.\n\nReporting someone who might have a weapon could be seen as trying to prevent potential harm to others. However, there could be considerations about profiling or unjustified suspicions, but without more context, it's hard to say. In general, if someone has a genuine concern about a potential threat, reporting it to the appropriate authorities is considered the right thing to do.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the person acted on their concern for safety by informing security. This doesn't seem like a morally wrong action; rather, it appears to be a precautionary measure.\n\nGiven these analyses, neither scenario seems to involve doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, not wearing sunscreen in hot springs when signs prohibit it is more about rule-following than morality. Unless there's a specific moral obligation I'm unaware of, I don't see this as a moral issue.\n\nIn Scenario 2, reporting a potential threat to security seems like a responsible action, assuming the person had a reasonable suspicion.\n\nSo, my final choice is \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
