                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about whether these two scenarios are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" I need to match these with Scenario 1 and Scenario 2.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"While camping, I gathered fallen logs to burn for a campfire.\"\n\nSo, someone is camping and they collect fallen logs to use as firewood for their campfire. Hmm, is this morally wrong?\n\nWell, I think I need to consider a few things here. Firstly, are these logs on public land or private property? If they're on public land, like a national forest or something, there might be rules about collecting firewood. I recall that in some places, you're allowed to collect dead and downed wood, but in others, there might be restrictions to prevent erosion or to maintain the ecosystem.\n\nBut, according to ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020, I think gathering fallen logs for a campfire is generally considered acceptable, especially if you're not causing any damage and the logs are already dead and on the ground.\n\nWait, but maybe there's an environmental impact. Like, maybe the logs are providing habitat for small animals or insects, or they might be part of the nutrient cycle in the forest. But, again, in ordinary moral terms, I don't think most people would consider this wrong, especially if you're being mindful about where you get the wood and how you use it.\n\nMaybe if the person was chopping down live trees or taking wood that was needed for some ecological reason, that might be different. But just gathering fallen logs seems okay.\n\nAlright, moving on to Scenario 2: \"My dog begged me for a treat so I gave him some peanut butter.\"\n\nOkay, so someone gives their dog peanut butter as a treat because the dog was begging.\n\nNow, I know that dogs sometimes beg for food, and as pet owners, we have to be careful about what we feed them. Some human foods can be dangerous for dogs, like chocolate, grapes, and onions, for example.\n\nBut what about peanut butter? I've heard mixed things about this. I think in general, peanut butter is considered safe for dogs in small amounts, as long as it doesn't contain xylitol, which is toxic to them. Xylitol is often found in sugar-free peanut butter, so you have to check the label.\n\nAssuming that the peanut butter doesn't have xylitol and is given in moderation, I think it's generally accepted that peanut butter is a okay treat for dogs.\n\nBut, I should also consider if the dog has any allergies or if peanut butter might cause digestive issues. Some dogs might be allergic to peanuts or have sensitive stomachs, so giving them peanut butter could cause them discomfort.\n\nHowever, in the scenario, it doesn't say that the dog had any bad reaction, so maybe the person knew it was safe for their particular dog.\n\nFrom an ordinary moral standpoint, I don't think giving a dog a small amount of peanut butter is wrong, provided that it's safe for the dog and given in moderation.\n\nSo, putting both scenarios together:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong\n\nScenario 2: Not wrong\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, gathering fallen logs for a campfire is generally acceptable, unless there are specific rules against it, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nIn Scenario 2, giving a dog some peanut butter, assuming it's safe and in moderation, is also generally acceptable.\n\nSo, I think \"Not wrong, Not wrong\" is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
