They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only. If I had not read it, I could never have believed that the devil should have put forth such follies at Rome and find a following.\"\nMartin Luther, Address to the Nobility of the German Nation, 1520\nHow is the \"temporal power\" mentioned in the passage best understood contextually?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Alright, I've got this passage from Martin Luther's \"Address to the Nobility of the German Nation,\" and it's about the Romanists\u2014meaning the Roman Catholic Church\u2014protecting themselves with three walls. I need to understand what \"temporal power\" means in this context. The options are:\n\nA. A clerical or ecclesiastical authority\n\nB. A legal or scholarly authority\n\nC. A state or secular authority\n\nD. A business or economic authority\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of the passage. Martin Luther was a key figure in the Protestant Reformation, and this work was written in 1520, a time when there was a lot of tension between the Church and various secular powers in Europe.\n\nThe passage mentions that the Romanists have protected themselves with three walls:\n\n1. They claim that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, and that the spiritual power is above the temporal.\n\n2. They say that only the Pope can interpret the Scriptures.\n\n3. They assert that only the Pope can call a council.\n\nSo, the first wall is about the relationship between temporal and spiritual powers. \"Temporal\" often refers to things that are worldly or secular, as opposed to spiritual or divine.\n\nLet me look up the definition of \"temporal power\" to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nTemporal power generally refers to the authority or control exercised over worldly or secular affairs, as opposed to spiritual matters. In historical contexts, especially in relation to the Church, \"temporal power\" often refers to the authority of secular rulers, like kings or princes, over the affairs of the state, distinct from the spiritual authority of the Church.\n\nSo, in this passage, when Luther says that the Romanists claim the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, he's saying that they believe the Church is above the laws of the state.\n\nLet me see if this makes sense in the context of the Reformation. During this period, there was a struggle between the authority of the Church and the authority of secular rulers. For example, in Germany, the Holy Roman Emperor and various princes had their own ideas about how much control they should have over religious matters in their territories.\n\nLuther was advocating for the independence of secular rulers from the Church's control, arguing that the Church should not have dominion over the state. So, if the Romanists were claiming that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, that would align with the Church asserting its supremacy over secular authorities.\n\nNow, let's consider each option:\n\nA. A clerical or ecclesiastical authority: This refers to the Church's own hierarchy and authority. But in this context, the temporal power is presented as distinct from the spiritual power. So, if temporal power is separate from the spiritual, it wouldn't be a clerical or ecclesiastical authority.\n\nB. A legal or scholarly authority: This could be a possibility, but it seems too broad. Legal authority could be part of the temporal power, but scholarly authority might not necessarily fit into the context of jurisdiction over the Church.\n\nC. A state or secular authority: This seems the most fitting, as it directly contrasts with the spiritual power of the Church. The passage is about the Church claiming to be above the laws of the state.\n\nD. A business or economic authority: While economic factors played a role in the Reformation, this option doesn't fit as well with the context of jurisdiction over the Church. The passage is more about political and religious authority, not economic power.\n\nGiven this analysis, I think the best answer is C. A state or secular authority.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider Luther's later comments in the passage. He criticizes the Church for claiming that only the Pope can interpret the Scriptures, and for asserting that only the Pope can call a council. These claims reinforce the idea that the Church is placing itself above secular authorities and claiming sole authority in matters of faith and Church governance.\n\nMoreover, Luther's critique is aimed at the concentration of power in the hands of the Pope and the Roman Church, arguing that this power should be more distributed, with secular rulers having a say in religious matters within their territories.\n\nTherefore, understanding \"temporal power\" as a state or secular authority makes the most sense in this context.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
