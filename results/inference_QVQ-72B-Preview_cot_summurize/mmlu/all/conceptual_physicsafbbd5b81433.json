                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about scaling up an object to three times its linear size. I need to figure out how the surface area and volume change. The options are a bit confusing, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how surface area and volume scale with linear dimensions. I remember that for similar shapes, the ratio of their areas is the square of the similarity ratio, and the ratio of their volumes is the cube of the similarity ratio.\n\nSo, if I scale an object by a factor of 3, meaning every linear dimension is multiplied by 3, then:\n\n- The surface area should be multiplied by \\(3^2 = 9\\).\n\n- The volume should be multiplied by \\(3^3 = 27\\).\n\nWait, but let's make sure I'm thinking about this correctly. Suppose I have a cube with side length \\(s\\). Its surface area would be \\(6s^2\\), and its volume would be \\(s^3\\).\n\nIf I scale the cube to have a side length of \\(3s\\), then its new surface area would be \\(6(3s)^2 = 6 \\times 9s^2 = 54s^2\\), which is 9 times the original surface area. Its new volume would be \\((3s)^3 = 27s^3\\), which is 27 times the original volume.\n\nOkay, that seems to confirm what I thought. So, according to this, the surface area increases by a factor of 9 and the volume by a factor of 27.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 3 and the volume by 9.\n\nB. 3 and the volume by 27.\n\nC. 9 and the volume by 27.\n\nD. 4 and the volume by 8.\n\nIt seems like option C matches my calculation: surface area increases by 9 and volume by 27.\n\nBut wait a minute, I should check if there's any other way to interpret the question. The question says \"the surface area increases by\" and then gives options like \"3 and the volume by 9,\" which seems to suggest that the surface area increases by a factor of 3 and the volume by 9, but that contradicts what I just calculated.\n\nI think the way the options are phrased is a bit confusing. They seem to be presenting two parts: the increase in surface area and the increase in volume, separated by \"and.\" So, option A is \"3 and the volume by 9,\" which would mean surface area increases by a factor of 3 and volume by a factor of 9.\n\nBut based on my calculations, that doesn't match. I found that scaling linear dimensions by 3 multiplies surface area by 9 and volume by 27. So, that would correspond to option C: \"9 and the volume by 27.\"\n\nIs there any scenario where scaling linear dimensions by 3 would increase surface area by a different factor? Maybe for different shapes, but I think for all similar shapes, the relationships should hold as I described.\n\nLet me consider another shape, say a sphere, to double-check. For a sphere, surface area is \\(4\\pi r^2\\) and volume is \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\). If I scale the radius by 3, the new surface area would be \\(4\\pi (3r)^2 = 4\\pi \\times 9r^2 = 36\\pi r^2\\), which is indeed 9 times the original surface area. The new volume would be \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (3r)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\times 27r^3 = 27 \\times \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\), which is 27 times the original volume.\n\nSo, for both a cube and a sphere, the scaling factors are the same. That reinforces that my initial thinking is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the increase in terms of absolute increases rather than multiplicative factors. But that seems unlikely, as scaling up linear dimensions would naturally lead to proportional increases in area and volume.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the incremental increases. If I have an original surface area \\(A\\) and volume \\(V\\), and after scaling, I have new surface area \\(9A\\) and new volume \\(27V\\), then the increase in surface area is \\(9A - A = 8A\\), and the increase in volume is \\(27V - V = 26V\\).\n\nBut the way the options are phrased, they seem to be stating the multiplicative factors rather than the absolute increases. So, perhaps they are referring to the factors by which the surface area and volume increase, not the actual increases.\n\nGiven that, my initial conclusion stands: surface area increases by a factor of 9 and volume by a factor of 27, which corresponds to option C.\n\nTo ensure I'm not missing something, maybe I should consider the units. If linear dimensions are scaled by 3, area (which is length squared) scales by \\(3^2 = 9\\), and volume (length cubed) scales by \\(3^3 = 27\\). That seems consistent.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider similar shapes. In similar shapes, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding linear dimensions, and the ratio of their volumes is the cube of that ratio. So, if the linear scale factor is 3, then area scale factor is \\(3^2 = 9\\) and volume scale factor is \\(3^3 = 27\\).\n\nThis seems to align perfectly with option C: 9 and the volume by 27.\n\nI think I've covered different angles here, and all point towards the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct choice is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
