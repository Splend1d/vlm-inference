                    "text": "Let's tackle this division problem: 123 divided by 8. I need to find out what the quotient and the remainder are. The options are:\n\nA. 15 remainder 7\n\nB. 15 remainder 3\n\nC. 16 remainder 5\n\nD. 16 remainder 1\n\nFirst, I should understand what division means. When we divide a number by another number, we're essentially finding out how many times one number fits into another and what's left over. So, in this case, I need to find out how many times 8 fits into 123 and what's remaining.\n\nI can start by estimating. I know that 8 times 10 is 80, and 8 times 15 is 120. Since 123 is larger than 120, 8 must fit into 123 more than 15 times. So, maybe 16 times? Let's check that.\n\n8 times 16 is 128. But 128 is larger than 123, so that would mean there's a negative remainder, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, I must have made a mistake here. If 8 times 15 is 120 and 8 times 16 is 128, which is beyond 123, then 15 might be too low, and 16 might be too high. But perhaps I need to consider that the quotient is 15 with some remainder.\n\nLet me try calculating it properly.\n\nFirst, I'll divide 123 by 8.\n\nI can think of it in terms of how many times 8 fits into 123.\n\nStarting with the first digit, 1 is less than 8, so I look at the first two digits, 12.\n\nHow many times does 8 fit into 12? 8 times 1 is 8, which is less than 12. 8 times 2 is 16, which is more than 12. So, 8 goes into 12 once.\n\nThen, I subtract 8 from 12, which gives me 4.\n\nNext, I bring down the next digit, which is 3, making it 43.\n\nNow, I see how many times 8 fits into 43.\n\n8 times 5 is 40, which is less than 43. 8 times 6 is 48, which is more than 43. So, 8 goes into 43 five times.\n\nI subtract 40 from 43, which leaves me with 3.\n\nSince there are no more digits to bring down, the division stops here, and the remainder is 3.\n\nSo, the quotient is 15 (from 1 and 5), and the remainder is 3.\n\nWait, but in the options, A is 15 remainder 7, B is 15 remainder 3, C is 16 remainder 5, and D is 16 remainder 1.\n\nBased on my calculation, the correct answer should be B. 15 remainder 3.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet's try multiplying the quotient by the divisor and adding the remainder to see if it equals the original number.\n\n15 times 8 is 120, plus the remainder of 3 equals 123. Yes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if I try 16 times 8, that's 128, which is already larger than 123, so that wouldn't work.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 15 remainder 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
