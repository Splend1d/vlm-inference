                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about supply and demand shifts and what happens to the equilibrium price and quantity. So, the demand for a product decreases while the supply increases. I need to figure out what happens to the equilibrium price and quantity.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how changes in demand and supply affect the equilibrium. Normally, if demand increases, the price and quantity both increase. If supply increases, the price decreases and the quantity increases. But in this case, both demand and supply are changing at the same time.\n\nSo, demand decreases and supply increases. That means people are wanting less of the product, and at the same time, producers are offering more of it in the market.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. I have a demand curve shifting to the left because demand is decreasing, and a supply curve shifting to the right because supply is increasing.\n\nNow, to find the new equilibrium, I need to see where the new demand curve and the new supply curve intersect.\n\nFrom the initial position, demand decreases (shift left), which would normally lead to a lower price and lower quantity. But supply increases (shift right), which would lead to a lower price and higher quantity.\n\nSo, both changes suggest that the price will decrease, but their effects on quantity are different: demand decrease suggests quantity decreases, while supply increase suggests quantity increases.\n\nTherefore, the price will definitely decrease, but the quantity is indeterminate because it depends on the relative magnitudes of the demand decrease and supply increase.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA. The equilibrium price will rise while the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.\n\nB. The equilibrium price will fall while the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.\n\nC. The equilibrium price is indeterminate while the equilibrium quantity will rise.\n\nD. The equilibrium price is indeterminate while the equilibrium quantity will fall.\n\nBased on my reasoning, B seems correct: price falls, quantity is indeterminate.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nLet's consider extreme cases.\n\nSuppose demand decreases by a tiny amount, and supply increases by a large amount. In this case, the increase in supply would dominate, and quantity would increase.\n\nConversely, if demand decreases by a large amount and supply increases by a tiny amount, quantity would decrease.\n\nSo, without knowing the relative magnitudes of the shifts, we can't determine whether quantity will increase or decrease.\n\nBut what about the price? Both a decrease in demand and an increase in supply suggest that price should fall.\n\nWait, no. If demand decreases and supply increases, both shifts suggest that price should fall.\n\nWait, but in the first scenario where demand decreases by a tiny amount and supply increases by a large amount, price would still fall because the supply increase is larger.\n\nSimilarly, if demand decreases by a lot and supply increases by a little, price still falls.\n\nSo, regardless of the relative magnitudes, price should fall.\n\nQuantity, however, could go either way, depending on how much demand decreases and how much supply increases.\n\nTherefore, price will fall, and quantity is indeterminate.\n\nSo, option B: The equilibrium price will fall while the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nI think the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
