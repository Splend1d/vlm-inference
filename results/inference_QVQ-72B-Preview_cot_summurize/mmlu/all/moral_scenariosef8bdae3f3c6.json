                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both scenarios being wrong, only the first being wrong, only the second being wrong, or neither being wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I put the cat on the porch one day while my allergic niece came to visit.\"\n\nSo, the person is putting their cat on the porch when their niece, who is allergic to cats, is visiting. Hmm, that seems like it could be a problem because of the niece's allergy. Allergies can be pretty serious, and exposing someone to something they're allergic to could cause them discomfort or even a severe reaction, depending on the severity of the allergy.\n\nBut maybe the person didn't know that the niece was allergic, or perhaps they thought keeping the cat outside would be okay. Still, if you know someone is allergic, it's generally considerate to try to minimize their exposure, especially if it's in your control.\n\nWait, but the scenario says \"while my allergic niece came to visit.\" So, the person knows that their niece is allergic. So, knowingly putting the cat on the porch when the niece is visiting seems inconsiderate and potentially harmful.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the person thought that keeping the cat outside would prevent the niece from coming into direct contact with the cat, but perhaps they didn't consider that cat dander can still cause allergies even if the cat isn't in the same room.\n\nI think, morally, it's not right to put someone at risk of an allergic reaction if you know they're allergic, especially if it's something you can control, like keeping your pet away during their visit.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"My son's teeth are all crooked, so I bring him to the dentist to get expensive braces.\"\n\nHere, the person is taking their son to the dentist to get braces because his teeth are crooked. Braces are a common orthodontic treatment to straighten teeth, and they can be quite expensive, as mentioned.\n\nGetting braces for a child is generally seen as a positive thing because it can improve their dental health, prevent future problems, and even boost their self-confidence. It's an investment in their well-being.\n\nUnless there's some reason why braces wouldn't be appropriate for the son, like if he has a medical condition that makes braces unsafe, but the scenario doesn't mention anything like that. So, based on the information given, taking the son to get braces seems like a responsible and caring parental decision.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 involves doing something morally wrong by exposing the allergic niece to the cat, while Scenario 2 involves doing something morally right by seeking dental treatment for the son's crooked teeth.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, but the options are labeled as A. Wrong, Wrong; B. Wrong, Not wrong; C. Not wrong, Wrong; D. Not wrong, Not wrong. So, for Scenario 1, Not wrong, and for Scenario 2, Wrong. That would be C.\n\nBut hold on, I think I might have misread the order. Let me check again.\n\nOption C says Not wrong, Wrong, meaning first scenario is not wrong, and second is wrong. But according to my reasoning, first scenario is wrong, and second is not wrong. So, that would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait, no. Option B is Wrong, Not wrong, meaning first scenario is wrong, and second is not wrong. That aligns with my reasoning.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nI think I initially misread the order of the options. It's important to pay attention to the order: first scenario, then second scenario.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
