A defendant was tried in state court for violating the anti-smoking statute. The prosecution's evidence consisted of testimony regarding the defendant's cigarette smoking at a restaurant. During the prosecution's case-in-chief, they called a witness who testified to a prior conviction of the defendant that had been excluded by the judge in a pretrial hearing.

The state won the appeal, but the prosecutor decided not to re-prosecute the defendant. However, the city attorney from the city in which the restaurant was located then sought to prosecute the defendant for the same incident under the city's anti-smoking ordinance, which was identical to the state statute. The city attorney planned to call as her only witness a man who testified at the defendant's first trial. The defendant moved to dismiss on the grounds that the prosecution of the city charge would violate his rights against double jeopardy.

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out whether the defendant's rights against double jeopardy would be violated if the city prosecutes him again for the same incident under a city ordinance that's identical to the state statute. The options are:\n\nA. Grant the motion, because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution.\n\nB. Grant the motion, because the law and the evidence will be identical at the second trial.\n\nC. Deny the motion, because the city and the state are separate sovereigns.\n\nD. Deny the motion, because the judge granted a mistrial.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what double jeopardy is. Double jeopardy is a constitutional protection that prevents someone from being tried twice for the same crime. It's based on the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which says no person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\n\nSo, in this case, the defendant was first tried in state court for violating the state's anti-smoking statute. The prosecution's case included testimony about the defendant smoking in a restaurant. During the prosecution's case, they called a witness who mentioned a prior conviction of the defendant that had been excluded by the judge in a pretrial hearing. The judge then immediately granted a mistrial and excused the jury.\n\nAfter that, the state prosecutor appealed the ruling under a statute that allowed prosecutorial appeals in such circumstances, and the state won the appeal. However, the prosecutor decided not to re-prosecute the defendant. Then, the city attorney from the city where the restaurant is located decided to prosecute the defendant for the same incident under the city's anti-smoking ordinance, which is identical to the state statute.\n\nNow, the defendant is moving to dismiss on the grounds that this second prosecution would violate his rights against double jeopardy.\n\nI need to determine whether this is indeed a case of double jeopardy.\n\nFirst, I should recall that double jeopardy attaches when a jury is empaneled and the defendant is put in jeopardy. In the first trial, the jury was empaneled, and the prosecution presented evidence, so jeopardy had indeed attached.\n\nBut then the judge granted a mistrial. Mistrials can be a bit tricky when it comes to double jeopardy. Generally, if a mistrial is declared without the defendant's consent, and it's due to prosecutorial misconduct, double jeopardy may bar a retrial. However, if the mistrial is declared for valid reasons unrelated to prosecutorial misconduct, double jeopardy may not attach.\n\nIn this case, the mistrial was granted because the prosecution violated the judge's ruling by introducing excluded evidence. That sounds like prosecutorial misconduct. So, it's possible that double jeopardy would bar a retrial by the state.\n\nBut here, the state won the appeal, and the prosecutor decided not to re-prosecute anyway. So, the state is no longer pursuing the case.\n\nNow, the city is stepping in to prosecute under its own ordinance.\n\nThis brings up the issue of separate sovereigns. The doctrine of separate sovereigns allows different levels of government to prosecute the same individual for the same conduct without violating double jeopardy, provided that each sovereign has the authority to define and enforce its own criminal laws.\n\nIn this scenario, the state and the city are both involved. Is the city considered a separate sovereign from the state?\n\nWell, cities are typically creatures of the state; they are local governments created by the state. In most jurisdictions, the city is not considered a separate sovereign for double jeopardy purposes when the state has already prosecuted the same conduct.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions and variations based on state law and specific circumstances.\n\nAnother consideration is that if the city ordinance is identical to the state statute, and the conduct being prosecuted is the same, it might be seen as the same offense for double jeopardy purposes.\n\nBut wait, there's also the concept of \"same offense.\" The Supreme Court has held that for purposes of double jeopardy, two offenses are the same if they have the same elements, meaning that each requires proof of an additional fact that the other does not.\n\nIn this case, both the state statute and the city ordinance prohibit smoking in certain establishments, so they likely have the same elements.\n\nAdditionally, there's the issue of collateral estoppel, which prevents relitigation of issues that were necessarily decided in a prior proceeding.\n\nBut perhaps that's not directly applicable here.\n\nLet me think about the options again.\n\nOption A says grant the motion because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution.\n\nWell, jeopardy did attach in the first prosecution, but the mistrial was declared, and depending on the reasons, that could affect whether double jeopardy bars a second prosecution.\n\nOption B says grant the motion because the law and evidence will be identical in the second trial.\n\nThis seems relevant because if the city is prosecuting for the same conduct under an identical law, it might be considered the same offense.\n\nOption C says deny the motion because the city and state are separate sovereigns.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, cities are typically not considered separate sovereigns from the state for double jeopardy purposes.\n\nOption D says deny the motion because the judge granted a mistrial.\n\nBut the mistrial was granted due to prosecutorial misconduct, which might bar retrial by the same sovereign.\n\nWait, but the city is a different sovereign from the state, so perhaps the mistrial by the state doesn't bar prosecution by the city.\n\nHowever, as I thought earlier, cities are often not considered separate sovereigns for double jeopardy purposes.\n\nLet me look up some case law or principles that might apply here.\n\nI recall the case of Heath v. Alabama, where the Supreme Court held that prosecutions by separate sovereigns\u2014specifically, different states\u2014are not barred by double jeopardy. But in that case, it was between two different states, not between a state and a city within that state.\n\nAnother relevant case is Waller v. Florida, which involved a similar situation where a defendant was prosecuted by both the state and a municipality for the same conduct.\n\nIn Waller, the Supreme Court held that because the municipality was an arm of the state, prosecutions by the municipality and the state for the same offense violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.\n\nSo, that seems directly on point here.\n\nTherefore, based on Waller, the city's prosecution would be barred by double jeopardy since the state has already prosecuted the defendant for the same conduct.\n\nSo, the motion to dismiss should be granted.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is either A or B.\n\nBut which one?\n\nOption A says grant the motion because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution.\n\nOption B says grant the motion because the law and evidence will be identical at the second trial.\n\nBoth are relevant, but perhaps option B is more comprehensive because it covers not just the attachment of jeopardy but also the fact that the second prosecution is for the same conduct under an identical law.\n\nWhereas option A is focusing only on the first prosecution, not on the identity of the offenses.\n\nSo, option B seems more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both A and B are relevant, but since only one option can be chosen, I'll go with B.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Grant the motion, because the law and the evidence will be identical at the second trial.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
