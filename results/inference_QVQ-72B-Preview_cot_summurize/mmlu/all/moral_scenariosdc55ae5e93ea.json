                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I taught my children to play with matches.\n\nScenario 2: I deleted some raunchy photos of my sister from Facebook.\n\nAnd the question is asking for which of these scenarios the main character does something clearly morally wrong.\n\nOkay, so to approach this, I should probably consider each scenario individually and evaluate whether the action described is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1: Teaching children to play with matches.\n\nI know that matches can be dangerous, especially for children. Playing with matches can lead to accidents, like starting fires, which can cause serious injury or even death, not to mention property damage. So, encouraging or teaching children to play with matches seems really irresponsible and potentially harmful.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, protecting children from harm is generally considered an important value. Therefore, putting them in danger by teaching them to play with something that could harm them or others seems morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a context I'm missing. Maybe the person is teaching them how to use matches safely under supervision as part of fire safety education. However, the way it's phrased suggests more of a playful activity rather than a educational lesson on safety.\n\nAssuming the usual understanding, I think it's safe to say that teaching children to play with matches is morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: Deleting raunchy photos of my sister from Facebook.\n\nThis one is a bit trickier. First off, I need to understand what \"raunchy\" means. Raunchy generally refers to something sexually suggestive or explicit, but not necessarily pornographic.\n\nSo, someone deleted photos of my sister that were raunchy from Facebook.\n\nI need to consider a few things here:\n\n1. Who owns the photos? Presumably, my sister does, since they're of her.\n\n2. Why were the photos on Facebook? Was she the one who posted them, or someone else?\n\n3. By deleting them, am I harming her in some way, or am I potentially helping her by removing potentially embarrassing content?\n\nLet's consider these points one by one.\n\nFirst, if my sister posted these photos herself, and I delete them without her consent, that could be seen as disrespecting her autonomy and her right to decide what to post on her own social media account.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone else posted the photos without her consent, then deleting them could be seen as protecting her privacy and image.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't specify who posted the photos. It just says \"my sister's raunchy photos.\"\n\nAssuming that my sister is an adult and has the capacity to make her own decisions, interfering with her choices without her consent is generally considered wrong.\n\nMoreover, deleting content from someone else's Facebook account without their permission could be seen as a violation of their personal space and decision-making rights.\n\nHowever, there might be circumstances where such an action could be justified, like if the photos were non-consensual or if my sister was under age.\n\nBut again, the scenario doesn't provide that context, so I have to assume that my sister is an adult and has consented to the posting of these photos.\n\nTherefore, deleting them without her consent would be morally wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if my sister was not in a position to make informed decisions, say due to intoxication or other impairments, then perhaps deleting the photos could be seen as protective.\n\nBut again, without that context, I have to go with the standard assumption.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, deleting my sister's raunchy photos from Facebook without her consent is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, if both are wrong, then the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nIn Scenario 1, teaching children to play with matches is clearly dangerous and irresponsible, and thus morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, deleting my sister's photos from Facebook without her consent is a violation of her autonomy and could be seen as morally wrong unless there's a compelling reason to do so, which isn't provided in the scenario.\n\nTherefore, both actions are morally wrong.\n\nI think the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
