                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Who is the career hit leader among players never elected to Baseball's Hall of Fame?\" And the options are Steve Garvey, Jim Rice, Pete Rose, and Ken Griffey Jr. Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out which one of these players has the most hits in their career but isn't in the Hall of Fame.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Hall of Fame is kind of a big deal in baseball. It's where they honor the best players in the sport's history. So, if someone isn't in there, it might be because they didn't meet the criteria, or maybe there were some controversies around their career.\n\nLet me start by recalling some basic information about each player.\n\nStarting with Steve Garvey. I remember he was a first baseman for the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Diego Padres. He was known for his consistency and durability, having a long streak of consecutive games played. I think he was a pretty good hitter, but was he Hall of Fame material? I'm not sure. Maybe he falls just short of those standards.\n\nNext, Jim Rice. He played for the Boston Red Sox, mostly as an outfielder. He was a powerful hitter, especially known for his home runs. I recall that he did get into the Hall of Fame eventually, but it might have taken a few tries. So, is he actually in? I think he is, so maybe I can eliminate him from consideration.\n\nThen there's Pete Rose. Oh, this is a tricky one. He's famous for having the most hits in MLB history, I believe. He played for several teams, including the Cincinnati Reds and the Philadelphia Phillies. He was a great hitter and had a long career. But, there's that whole gambling scandal where he bet on baseball games, which is a big no-no. Because of that, he's been ineligible for the Hall of Fame despite his impressive statistics.\n\nLastly, Ken Griffey Jr. He was an outfielder, mostly for the Seattle Mariners and the Cincinnati Reds. He was known for his smooth swing and outstanding defensive skills. I know he's in the Hall of Fame; he was even elected in his first year of eligibility, which is a big honor. So, he's definitely out of the running for this question.\n\nSo, now it's down to Steve Garvey and Pete Rose. I need to confirm who has the most career hits between them.\n\nI remember that Pete Rose holds the all-time hits record in MLB history. I think he surpassed Ty Cobb's previous record. His nickname was \"Charlie Hustle,\" and he was famous for his aggressive base running and dedication to the game. Despite his achievements, though, he's been kept out of the Hall of Fame due to the betting allegations and subsequent ban.\n\nSteve Garvey, while a very good player, doesn't have as many hits as Pete Rose. I believe Garvey's career hit total is around 2,500 to 2,600 hits, whereas Pete Rose has over 4,000 hits.\n\nLet me double-check that. A quick search in my mind\u2014Pete Rose's exact hit count is 4,256 hits, which is the most in MLB history. Garvey, I think, has around 2,599 hits, which is impressive but not close to Rose's total.\n\nSo, based on that, Pete Rose is clearly the career hit leader among players never elected to the Hall of Fame.\n\nWait a minute, but is Pete Rose actually eligible for the Hall of Fame? I recall that he's been banned from baseball for betting on games, which includes being ineligible for the Hall of Fame. So, technically, he can't be elected as long as the ban stands.\n\nBut, the question is phrased as \"never elected to Baseball's Hall of Fame.\" It doesn't specify whether they're ineligible or not; it just says never elected. So, Pete Rose fits into that category.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Pete Rose.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other player among the options who might have more hits.\n\nJim Rice and Ken Griffey Jr. are both in the Hall of Fame, so they're out.\n\nSteve Garvey, as I recalled, has fewer hits than Pete Rose.\n\nSo, yeah, Pete Rose is the correct answer.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Pete Rose}} \\]"
