Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic service, so that they might get enough to eat.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question. It's about a passage from Jacob Riis's book \"How the Other Half Lives\" from 1890. The passage describes the harsh living and working conditions of a young woman in the manufacturing department of a Broadway house. She earns an average of three dollars a week, pays one dollar and fifty cents for her room, and can only afford one meal a day because she can't manage lunch. Breakfast is just a cup of coffee. The author highlights that despite her youth and attractiveness, she faces a life of near-starvation and desperation.\n\nThe question asks which of the given options is most directly comparable to the situation of these young women. The options are:\n\nA. American revolutionaries in the 1770s\n\nB. Slaves in the antebellum South\n\nC. Populist farmers in the 1890s\n\nD. Detroit autoworkers in the 1930s\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of each option.\n\nStarting with A: American revolutionaries in the 1770s. These were colonists in British America who were dissatisfied with British rule and ultimately fought for independence. Their main grievances were political and economic oppressions from the British government, such as taxes without representation and restrictive trade policies. While they did face hardships, their situation was different from that of the young women in the passage, who were dealing with extreme poverty and inadequate nutrition in an urban industrial setting.\n\nOption B: Slaves in the antebellum South. Slavery was a brutal institution where enslaved people were considered property, facing forced labor, separation of families, and physical abuse. Their situation was characterized by complete lack of freedom and human rights. Comparing this to the young women in the passage, who, although poor and struggling, were not enslaved and had some autonomy, seems like a stretch. However, both groups faced extreme economic disadvantages and lack of control over their lives.\n\nOption C: Populist farmers in the 1890s. The Populist movement emerged in the late 19th century, largely in response to the struggles of farmers facing debt, low crop prices, and the monopolistic practices of railroads and grain elevators. These farmers were spread out in rural areas and were fighting against economic exploitation and the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few industrialists and bankers. While their situation was also difficult, it was different from that of urban industrial workers like the young women in the passage.\n\nOption D: Detroit autoworkers in the 1930s. During the 1930s, especially during the Great Depression, autoworkers in Detroit faced tough working conditions, low wages, and job insecurity. However, this was also a time when labor unions were gaining strength, and workers were organizing for better pay and working conditions. Compared to the young women in the 1890s, these autoworkers had more organized support and were part of a larger industrial workforce.\n\nNow, considering the specificities of each option, I need to determine which one is most directly comparable to the young women in the passage.\n\nThe young women in the passage are urban industrial workers facing extreme poverty, inadequate nutrition, and limited options for improvement. They are part of the working class in a major city, subjected to long hours and low pay, with little to no job security or social safety net.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The American revolutionaries were fighting against colonial rule, which is different from the economic struggles of industrial workers.\n\nB. Slaves were in a completely different and more oppressive situation, characterized by total lack of freedom and human rights.\n\nC. Populist farmers were rural dwellers facing economic exploitation, but their circumstances were distinct from those of urban factory workers.\n\nD. Detroit autoworkers in the 1930s were part of a more organized labor movement, with some degree of collective bargaining and union support, which was not the case for the young women in the 1890s.\n\nGiven these considerations, none of the options seem perfectly comparable, but if I had to choose the one that is most directly comparable, I would lean towards D: Detroit autoworkers in the 1930s. While there were differences in terms of organization and the presence of unions, both groups were urban industrial workers facing challenging economic conditions and seeking better lives.\n\nHowever, I have some doubts about this choice. The young women in the passage seem to be in a more desperate situation, with near-starvation levels of nutrition and limited options for improvement. The Detroit autoworkers, although facing hardships, had some avenues for collective action and improvement through unions.\n\nPerhaps a better comparison would be with the Populist farmers (option C), as both were facing economic exploitation and were part of the larger economic changes occurring in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, the Populists were primarily rural and dealt with agricultural issues, whereas the young women were urban factory workers.\n\nAlternatively, considering the extreme poverty and lack of opportunities, maybe slavery (option B) is a more fitting comparison, but that feels too extreme, as slaves were entirely without freedom or legal rights, whereas the young women, though poor, had some agency and were not enslaved.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should consider the concept of wage slavery, which was a term used during the 19th century to describe the condition of workers who were dependent on wages from employers and had little control over their working conditions or wages. This concept bridges the gap between the conditions of slaves and those of free wage earners.\n\nIf I consider this, then maybe option B (slaves in the antebellum South) could be seen as a more direct comparison in terms of economic dependency and lack of control over one's life. However, it's important to note that slaves were not just economically dependent; they were also legally enslaved and faced violent oppression.\n\nGiven that, I think it's a stretch to equate the situation of the young women in the passage directly with that of slaves. Their situations were significantly different in terms of legal status and the nature of their oppression.\n\nLet me consider option A again: American revolutionaries in the 1770s. These individuals were fighting against tyranny and seeking independence and freedom. While they did face hardships, their struggle was more about political liberty than about day-to-day survival, which seems different from the young women's situation.\n\nOption C: Populist farmers in the 1890s. These farmers were organized into the Populist Party and were advocating for reforms such as government ownership of railroads, graduated income taxes, and direct election of senators. Their situation involved economic exploitation but was more focused on agricultural issues and rural life, which differs from the urban industrial setting of the young women in the passage.\n\nOption D: Detroit autoworkers in the 1930s. By the 1930s, labor unions had gained significant strength, and workers were able to negotiate better wages and working conditions. While there were still challenges, the support structures and labor laws were more developed compared to the 1890s.\n\nIn contrast, the young women in the passage were in the late 19th century, a time when industrialization was rapidly changing the economy, and workers had limited protections and few avenues for collective action.\n\nGiven all this, perhaps the most direct comparison is with option C: Populist farmers in the 1890s. Both groups were part of significant economic transformations\u2014farmers facing the challenges of an agricultural depression and industrial workers facing the exploitations of early industrial capitalism.\n\nHowever, I still feel that option D: Detroit autoworkers in the 1930s might be a closer comparison because they were also industrial workers, even if their situation was somewhat better due to the rise of labor unions.\n\nBut wait, the passage is from 1890, and the Populist movement was at its height around that time. So, chronologically, it makes sense to compare the young women's situation with that of Populist farmers in the same era.\n\nMoreover, both groups were part of the broader Progressive Era reforms that aimed to address social and economic inequalities.\n\nOn the other hand, comparing them with Detroit autoworkers in the 1930s might not be as direct, as that was a different time with different labor laws and union strengths.\n\nPerhaps the key here is the time period. Since the passage is from 1890, and the Populist movement was active around that time, option C might be the most directly comparable.\n\nBut let's think differently. Maybe the question isn't just about the time period but about the nature of the economic struggles.\n\nThe young women in the passage are facing extreme poverty, inadequate nutrition, and limited options for improvement due to the structure of the economy and the lack of social safety nets.\n\nSimilarly, Populist farmers were facing economic exploitation by large corporations and a lack of government support, leading to debt and poverty.\n\nIn both cases, the individuals were part of a larger system that was stacked against them, and they were organizing to demand changes.\n\nIn contrast, Detroit autoworkers in the 1930s were part of a more established industrial sector with growing union power, which had achieved some successes in improving working conditions and wages.\n\nTherefore, between options C and D, option C seems more directly comparable in terms of the severity of the economic struggles and the need for collective action against powerful economic interests.\n\nOption A, the American revolutionaries, were fighting for independence from a foreign power, which is a different kind of struggle, and option B, slaves in the antebellum South, were in a far more oppressive and dehumanizing situation.\n\nTherefore, the most direct comparison is likely option C: Populist farmers in the 1890s.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another perspective.\n\nPerhaps the young women in the passage can be seen as part of the larger working-class movement that led to the formation of labor unions and the fight for better working conditions and wages.\n\nIn that case, their situation might be comparable to that of other industrial workers of the time, not just farmers.\n\nHowever, since option C specifically mentions Populist farmers in the 1890s, and considering that the passage is also from the 1890s, it seems fitting to choose this option as the most direct comparison.\n\nAdditionally, the Populist movement was known for its appeals to both farmers and urban workers, so there might have been some overlap in their struggles and objectives.\n\nTherefore, I believe the best answer is option C: Populist farmers in the 1890s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
