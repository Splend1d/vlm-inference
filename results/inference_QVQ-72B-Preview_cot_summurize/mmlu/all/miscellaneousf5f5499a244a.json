                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"How are actors Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez related?\" And the options are A. They're cousins, B. They're brothers, C. They're father and son, D. They're uncle and nephew. Hmm, I need to figure this out. I know that Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez are both actors, and I've seen some of their movies. But I'm not entirely sure about their family relationship.\n\nLet me think first. I recall that Charlie Sheen is the son of actor Martin Sheen, right? And Emilio Estevez is also an actor, and I think he has a brother who is also famous, but I might be confusing things. Wait, actually, Emilio Estevez is part of the same family as Charlie Sheen, but I'm not sure exactly how they're related.\n\nMaybe I should look up their family tree or something. But since I can't do that right now, I'll have to rely on my memory and some general knowledge.\n\nI remember that Martin Sheen has several children, including Charlie Sheen. And I think Emilio Estevez is also related to Martin Sheen, but perhaps from a different marriage or something like that. Wait, no, I think Martin Sheen was married to Valerie Bertinelli, and they had Charlie Sheen and another son, Ramon Estevez. Wait, is that right?\n\nActually, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to piece this together. Martin Sheen and Valerie Bertinelli were married and had two sons: Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. I think Charlie Sheen is Martin Sheen's son, but Emilio Estevez is related differently.\n\nLet me try another approach. I know that Emilio Estevez is an actor who has been in movies like \"The Breakfast Club\" and \"The Mighty Ducks.\" Charlie Sheen is known for movies like \"Platoon\" and \"Wall Street.\" They both have Spanish surnames, which makes sense because Martin Sheen's real name is Ram\u00f3n Gerardo Antonio Est\u00e9vez.\n\nWait a minute, maybe their father is Martin Sheen, and they both have the same father but different mothers. But I think they have the same mother as well. Let me see.\n\nI think Martin Sheen was married to Janet Templeton, and they had four children: Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen, Ramon Estevez, and Renee Estevez. So, if that's the case, then Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez are brothers, right?\n\nBut I've also heard something about Emilio Estevez having a different mother, but I think that might be a mistake. Maybe I'm confusing him with another actor.\n\nLet me consider the options again:\n\nA. They're cousins: No, I don't think so. Cousins are usually from different branches of the family, and since both are children of Martin Sheen, they should be siblings.\n\nB. They're brothers: This seems plausible.\n\nC. They're father and son: No, I know that Martin Sheen is the father of both.\n\nD. They're uncle and nephew: That doesn't make sense because they are both the same generation in the family.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option B. They're brothers is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I'll double-check. I recall that in an interview, Charlie Sheen referred to Emilio Estevez as his brother, so that aligns with what I think.\n\nAdditionally, I know that Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen have worked together in some films, which further suggests they are brothers.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
