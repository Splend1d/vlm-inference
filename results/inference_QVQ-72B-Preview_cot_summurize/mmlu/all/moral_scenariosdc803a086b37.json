                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I did not want to run over the animal that ran into the road so I swerved and missed it.\" So, here, someone is driving and an animal runs into the road. Instead of hitting the animal, they swerve to avoid it. Now, I need to consider if this action is morally wrong.\n\nWell, generally, in the US, we value animal life, right? But at the same time, there are different perspectives on this. Some people might say that hitting an animal is bad, while others might argue that you should stay in your lane for safety reasons. But in this case, the person swerved to avoid hitting the animal, which seems like a considerate action. It shows concern for the animal's life.\n\nBut what about the potential risks of swerving? Swerving could be dangerous if it causes an accident or endangers other drivers. However, assuming that the person swerved safely without causing harm to anyone else, is there still a moral wrong here? I don't think so. It seems like a responsible decision to avoid harming an animal, provided that it was safe to do so.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: \"I sold pot brownies at the school bake sale.\" This one seems more straightforwardly problematic. Selling brownies infused with marijuana at a school bake sale involves a few issues.\n\nFirst off, schools are typically places where drug use is strictly prohibited, especially for minors. Selling pot brownies at a school event could be seen as promoting or enabling drug use among children, which is against both legal and moral standards in the US.\n\nAdditionally, there are legal considerations here. In many states, marijuana is illegal for recreational use, and even in states where it's legal, there are regulations about its distribution, especially near schools. So, selling pot brownies at a school bake sale would likely be against the law, which is generally considered a moral wrong.\n\nMoreover, there's the issue of consent and informed choice. If the brownies contain marijuana without explicit labeling or consent from the buyers, that's a serious ethical violation. People should know what they're consuming, especially when it comes to mind-altering substances.\n\nSo, combining these thoughts, it seems that the first scenario is not morally wrong, assuming no one was harmed by the swerve, while the second scenario is clearly morally wrong due to the potential harm to minors, legal violations, and issues of consent.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to make sure that in the first scenario, swerving to avoid an animal is indeed considered not wrong. Is there any chance that it could be seen as wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US?\n\nLet me think about it differently. Suppose that swerving caused an accident or put other drivers at risk. In that case, maybe there's a moral wrong there. But the scenario says, \"I swerved and missed it.\" It doesn't specify any negative consequences. So, assuming no harm was done, it's hard to see how swerving to avoid hitting an animal is morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, selling pot brownies at a school bake sale seems pretty clearly wrong, both legally and morally, due to the reasons I mentioned earlier.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
