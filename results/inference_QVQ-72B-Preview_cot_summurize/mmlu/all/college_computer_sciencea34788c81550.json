                    "text": "So I have this question about height-balanced binary search trees, and I need to figure out which statements are true. Let's start by making sure I understand what a height-balanced binary search tree is. It's a binary search tree where for every node, the height of its left subtree and the height of its right subtree differ by at most 1. So, it's a type of self-balancing tree.\n\nOkay, now let's look at each statement:\n\nI. Worst-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes.\n\nIn a balanced binary search tree, the height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes, right? Because the tree is balanced, it stays roughly logarithmic in height. So, in the worst case, a search would take time proportional to the height of the tree, which is log n, where n is the number of nodes. So, this seems true.\n\nII. Average-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes.\n\nSimilarly, in a balanced BST, the average-case search time should also be logarithmic because the tree is balanced, ensuring that on average, you're splitting the search space in half each time. So, this also seems true.\n\nIII. Best-case search time is proportional to the height of the tree.\n\nThis one is a bit tricky. In a balanced BST, the best-case search time would be when the search key is found at the root, which would be O(1), but in general, if the best case is considered in terms of the height, it would still be O(h), where h is the height of the tree. But in a balanced BST, h is O(log n), so this would still be logarithmic. However, the phrasing says \"proportional to the height of the tree,\" which is a bit vague. Maybe it's trying to say that the best-case time is O(h), which is indeed logarithmic in a balanced BST. So, this might be true, but I'm a bit unsure about the phrasing.\n\nIV. The height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes.\n\nThis is directly related to the definition of a balanced BST. Since the tree is balanced, its height is guaranteed to be O(log n), where n is the number of nodes. So, this is definitely true.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. I and III only\n\nB. II and III only\n\nC. II and IV only\n\nD. I, II, and IV\n\nFrom my analysis, I, II, and IV seem to be true. III is a bit ambiguous, but given that in a balanced BST, the height is logarithmic, and the best-case search time is O(h), which is logarithmic, I think III is also true. However, I'm not entirely sure if \"proportional to the height of the tree\" is considered a strong enough statement to say it's logarithmic, but given the context, I think it is.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think differently. The question says \"best-case search time is proportional to the height of the tree.\" In a balanced BST, the height is log n, so anything proportional to h would still be log n, which is acceptable. So, I think III is true.\n\nTherefore, all statements I, II, and IV are true. So, the correct answer should be D. I, II, and IV.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any chance that in some cases, the height isn't logarithmic? Well, in a balanced BST, by definition, the height is guaranteed to be logarithmic, so IV is definitely true. And since search time depends on the height, both worst-case and average-case search times are logarithmic, so I and II are true. And III seems to be true based on the earlier reasoning.\n\nAlright, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
