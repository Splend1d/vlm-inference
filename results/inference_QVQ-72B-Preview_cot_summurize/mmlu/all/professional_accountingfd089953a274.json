                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Palmyra Co. has a few different financial items listed, and I need to figure out what their comprehensive income is. The options are $4,000, $10,000, $11,000, and $17,000. Hmm, let's start by recalling what comprehensive income includes.\n\nI remember that comprehensive income includes both net income and other comprehensive income. Net income is basically the profit after all expenses and revenues are accounted for. Other comprehensive income includes things like unrealized gains and losses from certain investments and foreign currency translations that aren't part of the net income calculation.\n\nSo, first, net income is $11,000. Then there's a positive $1,000 net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. I think that's part of net income because it's a adjustment due to changing how they account for something. So, that probably gets added to net income.\n\nNext, there's a $3,000 unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities. Unrealized losses are decreases in value that haven't been realized through selling the securities. Since it's a loss, that should be subtracted from net income to get to comprehensive income.\n\nThen, there's a positive $2,000 foreign currency translation adjustment. This happens when a company translates its foreign operations' financial statements into the reporting currency. If it's positive, that's a gain, which should be added to net income.\n\nLastly, there's a $6,000 increase in common stock. Wait a minute, that's different. Increasing common stock usually means the company issued more shares, which brings in more equity but isn't directly related to comprehensive income. Comprehensive income is about changes in equity that result from operations and other comprehensive items, not from transactions with shareholders like issuing new stock.\n\nSo, maybe I shouldn't include the increase in common stock when calculating comprehensive income. Let me double-check that.\n\nComprehensive income is essentially net income plus other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income includes items like unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustments. Changes in common stock, on the other hand, are transactions with shareholders that affect equity directly, not through operations or other comprehensive items.\n\nTherefore, I think the $6,000 increase in common stock shouldn't be included in the comprehensive income calculation.\n\nNow, let's summarize:\n\nNet income: $11,000\n\nPlus: net cumulative effect of change in accounting principle: $1,000\n\nMinus: unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities: ($3,000)\n\nPlus: foreign currency translation adjustment: $2,000\n\nTotal comprehensive income: ?\n\nWait, but is the net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle included in net income or other comprehensive income? I think it's part of net income because it's a adjustment to how the company accounts for certain items, and it affects the current period's net income.\n\nLet me confirm that. According to accounting standards, the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is reported in net income, not in other comprehensive income. So, yes, it should be added to net income.\n\nSo, starting with net income of $11,000, adding $1,000 for the accounting change, that brings us to $12,000.\n\nThen, subtract the $3,000 unrealized loss, which gives us $9,000.\n\nThen, add the $2,000 foreign currency translation adjustment, resulting in $11,000.\n\nSo, according to this calculation, comprehensive income is $11,000, which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other item that should be included in other comprehensive income?\n\nI think I've covered the main components. Net income plus other comprehensive income equals comprehensive income.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes, other comprehensive income includes items like pension adjustments or changes in the value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. But in this problem, only unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustments are mentioned.\n\nAlso, the increase in common stock is a transaction that affects shareholders' equity but isn't part of comprehensive income.\n\nSo, my final answer is $11,000, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
