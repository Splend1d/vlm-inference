Employee rights, B. Employee duties, C. Employer duties, D. Employee duties again? Wait, seems like there might be a typo because options B and D are both \"employee duties.\" Hmm, maybe it's supposed to be A. Employee rights, B. Employee duties, C. Employer duties, D. Something else. But anyway, I need to choose from the given options.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is about the obligations of workers towards their employer. So, it's asking what we call these responsibilities that employees have, which are based on their employment contracts and broader employment laws.\n\nFirst, let's consider what \"employee rights\" refer to. Employee rights are typically the protections and entitlements that employees have under the law or their contracts, such as the right to a safe workplace, minimum wage, overtime pay, and freedom from discrimination. So, these are things that the employer is obligated to provide or ensure for the employee, not the other way around. Therefore, employee rights aren't the obligations of workers towards their employer. So, option A seems incorrect.\n\nNext, \"employee duties.\" This sounds plausible. Duties generally refer to responsibilities or obligations that one has towards another. In this case, employee duties would be the responsibilities that employees have towards their employer. These could include things like performing their job to the best of their abilities, following company policies, maintaining confidentiality, and so on. These duties are often outlined in employment contracts and are also governed by employment laws.\n\nNow, \"employer duties.\" Similar logic applies here. Employer duties are the responsibilities that the employer has towards the employee. These might include paying the employee on time, providing a safe working environment, respecting employee rights, and so on. Again, these are obligations of the employer to the employee, not the other way around.\n\nGiven that options B and D are both \"employee duties,\" it seems there might be a repetition error. But assuming that's the case, and considering the context, it's likely that one of them was intended to be something else, perhaps \"employer rights\" or another term. However, since that's not the case, I'll proceed with the options given.\n\nSo, between the options provided, B. Employee duties seems to be the correct answer. It directly refers to the obligations of workers towards their employer, which are based on individual contracts and wider employment laws.\n\nJust to double-check, let's think about it another way. If I were to look up what constitutes the obligations of workers towards their employer, I would expect to find things like job responsibilities, loyalty, adherence to company policies, etc. These are all duties that employees have in their professional relationships with their employers.\n\nEmployee rights, on the other hand, are about the protections and benefits employees are entitled to, which don't relate to their obligations towards the employer in the same way.\n\nEmployer duties are similar to employee rights, in that they outline what the employer must provide or ensure for the employee.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer from the given options is B. Employee duties.\n\nI think that's the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
