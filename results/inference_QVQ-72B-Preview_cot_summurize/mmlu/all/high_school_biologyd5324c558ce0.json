                    "text": "Okay, so I have this question about viruses. It's asking what all viruses contain at least these two principal components, and the options are:\n\nA. DNA and proteins\n\nB. nucleic acid and a capsid\n\nC. DNA and cell membrane\n\nD. RNA and cell wall\n\nHmm, I need to recall what viruses are made of. I know that viruses are tiny infectious agents that can't reproduce on their own; they need to infect living cells to make copies of themselves.\n\nFirst, let's think about what all viruses have. I remember that all viruses have genetic material and a protein coat that protects that genetic material.\n\nSo, option B says nucleic acid and a capsid. Nucleic acid is the genetic material, which can be either DNA or RNA in viruses, and a capsid is the protein shell that covers the nucleic acid. That sounds like a general description of what all viruses have.\n\nBut let's check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption A is DNA and proteins. While many viruses do contain DNA as their genetic material, some viruses have RNA instead. So, not all viruses have DNA. But they all have proteins in their capsids. So, this option isn't accurate for all viruses.\n\nOption C is DNA and cell membrane. Again, not all viruses have DNA, and as for cell membranes, I don't think viruses have cell membranes. They might have envelopes in some cases, but envelopes are not the same as cell membranes, and not all viruses have envelopes.\n\nOption D is RNA and cell wall. Similar to option C, not all viruses have RNA; some have DNA. And I don't think viruses have cell walls. Cell walls are typically found in bacteria.\n\nSo, based on this, option B seems to be the correct answer because all viruses have nucleic acid (either DNA or RNA) and a capsid, which is the protein shell.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"at least these two principal components.\" So, are there viruses that don't have nucleic acid or a capsid?\n\nNo, I don't think so. The definition of a virus includes having genetic material and a protein coat.\n\nLet me double-check. If I look at the structure of a virus, it's basically composed of nucleic acid enclosed within a protein shell called the capsid. So, yes, nucleic acid and capsid are universal components of viruses.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there are any exceptions. Are there viruses without nucleic acid or without a capsid?\n\nI don't think so. Without nucleic acid, it wouldn't be a virus because that's their genetic material. And without a capsid, the nucleic acid would be exposed, which isn't typical for viruses.\n\nPrions are sometimes considered infectious agents without nucleic acid, but they are not true viruses; they are misfolded proteins.\n\nSo, in conclusion, all viruses contain at least nucleic acid and a capsid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
