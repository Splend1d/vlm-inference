                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"In humans, each cell normally contains ______ of chromosomes.\" And the options are A. 11 pairs, B. 23 pairs, C. 32 pairs, D. 46 pairs. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that chromosomes are structures in cells that carry genetic information. They come in pairs, and humans have a certain number of these pairs. But what's the exact number?\n\nLet me think back to my biology class. I recall that humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. That sounds familiar. So that would be option B. 23 pairs.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If there are 23 pairs, that means there are 46 chromosomes in total, right? Because each pair consists of two chromosomes. So, 23 pairs would be 46 chromosomes. That makes sense.\n\nBut looking at option D, it says 46 pairs. That would be 92 chromosomes, which I don't think is correct for humans. So, option D is probably wrong.\n\nOption A is 11 pairs, which would be 22 chromosomes. That seems too few for humans. I think that's the number for some other organisms, maybe fruit flies or something, but not humans.\n\nOption C is 32 pairs, which would be 64 chromosomes. Again, that doesn't ring a bell for human cells. I think some plants might have higher chromosome numbers, but for humans, it's 23 pairs.\n\nJust to be sure, I can visualize a karyotype, which is a picture of all the chromosomes in a cell. In humans, when we look at a karyotype, there are 23 pairs, ranging from the largest chromosomes, the autosomes, down to the smallest, and including the sex chromosomes.\n\nAlso, I remember that each pair has a specific size and shape, and they come in homologous pairs, except in males where one pair is the X and Y chromosome.\n\nSo, based on this, option B. 23 pairs seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if there's any exception or special case where humans might have a different number of chromosome pairs. For example, in reproductive cells like sperm and eggs, which are haploid, they have half the number of chromosomes, so 23 unpaired chromosomes. But the question specifies \"each cell normally contains,\" which likely refers to somatic cells, not reproductive cells.\n\nMoreover, in some rare conditions or disorders, people might have an abnormal number of chromosomes, like in Down syndrome, where there's an extra chromosome in pair 21, making it 24 pairs. But again, the question is about the normal number in healthy individuals.\n\nTherefore, in standard human somatic cells, the normal chromosome count is 23 pairs.\n\nJust to make extra sure, I can think about the genetic notation. The diploid number (2n) for humans is 46, which corresponds to 23 pairs. So, that aligns with option B.\n\nI don't think I'm missing anything here. The answer should be B. 23 pairs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
