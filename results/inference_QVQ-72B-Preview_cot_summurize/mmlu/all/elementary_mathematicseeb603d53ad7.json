                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have seven desks in a row, and we're dealing with three people: Hector, Kim, and Tonya. The relationships are a bit tangled, so I need to map this out carefully.\n\nFirst, let's label the desks from left to right as positions 1 through 7. That way, we can keep track of where everyone is sitting.\n\nThe problem states:\n\n1. Hector sits 2 seats to the right of Kim.\n\n2. Tonya sits 3 seats to the right of Hector.\n\nAnd the question is: how many seats to the left of Tonya does Kim sit?\n\nAlright, so we need to find the positions of Kim, Hector, and Tonya based on these relationships and then determine the distance between Kim and Tonya.\n\nLet me consider possible positions for Kim and see where Hector and Tonya would be based on that.\n\nLet's assume Kim is sitting at position 1.\n\nIf Kim is at position 1, then Hector, who sits 2 seats to the right of Kim, would be at position 3.\n\nThen, Tonya sits 3 seats to the right of Hector. From position 3, moving 3 seats to the right would place Tonya at position 6.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n- Kim: 1\n\n- Hector: 3\n\n- Tonya: 6\n\nTo find out how many seats to the left of Tonya (at position 6) Kim (at position 1) sits, we can subtract their positions: 6 - 1 = 5.\n\nSo, Kim sits 5 seats to the left of Tonya.\n\nWait a minute, but let's check if this is the only possible arrangement. Maybe there are other positions for Kim that could satisfy the given conditions.\n\nLet's try another position for Kim. Suppose Kim is at position 2.\n\nThen, Hector sits 2 seats to the right of Kim, which would be position 4.\n\nTonya sits 3 seats to the right of Hector, which would be position 7.\n\nSo, positions would be:\n\n- Kim: 2\n\n- Hector: 4\n\n- Tonya: 7\n\nNow, the distance between Kim (2) and Tonya (7) is 7 - 2 = 5 seats. Again, Kim is 5 seats to the left of Tonya.\n\nHmm, same result. Let's try another position for Kim.\n\nIf Kim is at position 3, then Hector is 2 seats to the right, which would be position 5.\n\nTonya is 3 seats to the right of Hector, which would be position 8. But wait, there are only 7 desks. Position 8 doesn't exist. So, this arrangement isn't possible.\n\nTherefore, Kim cannot be at position 3 or beyond, because there aren't enough desks to place Hector and Tonya without exceeding the total number of desks.\n\nLet me check if there are any other possible arrangements where Kim is at position 4 or higher, but given the constraints, it seems unlikely.\n\nFor example, if Kim is at position 4, Hector would be at position 6, and Tonya at position 9, which is beyond the 7 desks. Not possible.\n\nSimilarly, if Kim is at position 5, Hector at 7, Tonya at 10 \u2013 again, not feasible.\n\nPositions 6 and 7 would also lead to Tonya being placed beyond the 7 desks available.\n\nTherefore, the only possible arrangements are with Kim at positions 1 or 2, both of which result in Kim being 5 seats to the left of Tonya.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that there are 7 desks arranged in a row, and all three people must be seated somewhere among these 7 desks.\n\nIn both feasible arrangements (Kim at 1 or 2), Kim is 5 seats to the left of Tonya.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 2\n\nB. 3\n\nC. 5\n\nD. 12\n\nOption C. 5 is one of the choices, but let's make sure there isn't a different interpretation of the problem that could lead to another answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of seats between Kim and Tonya, not counting the seats themselves, but rather the distance between them.\n\nLet's re-examine the arrangements:\n\nFirst arrangement:\n\n- Kim: 1\n\n- Hector: 3\n\n- Tonya: 6\n\nThe seats between Kim and Tonya are positions 2, 4, 5, which is 3 seats. So, Kim is 3 seats to the left of Tonya.\n\nWait a minute, earlier I calculated it as 5 seats, but that was considering the position numbers, not the actual seats between them.\n\nSimilarly, in the second arrangement:\n\n- Kim: 2\n\n- Hector: 4\n\n- Tonya: 7\n\nSeats between Kim and Tonya are positions 3, 5, 6 \u2013 again, 3 seats.\n\nSo, perhaps the question is asking for the number of seats between Kim and Tonya, not the position difference.\n\nIn that case, in both arrangements, there are 3 seats between Kim and Tonya.\n\nBut the question specifically says: \"how many seats to the left of Tonya does Kim sit?\"\n\nIt doesn't specify counting the seats between them, but rather the distance in seats to the left.\n\nSo, if Kim is at position 1 and Tonya at 6, the number of seats to the left of Tonya that Kim sits is 5.\n\nSimilarly, if Kim is at 2 and Tonya at 7, it's still 5 seats to the left.\n\nBut earlier, counting the seats between them gave 3, which is also an option.\n\nI think there's some confusion here about what the question is asking.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nPerhaps \"how many seats to the left of Tonya does Kim sit?\" is asking for the position difference between Tonya and Kim, with the direction being to the left.\n\nIn the first arrangement:\n\nKim at 1, Tonya at 6.\n\nThe difference is 5 seats to the left.\n\nIn the second arrangement:\n\nKim at 2, Tonya at 7.\n\nAgain, the difference is 5 seats to the left.\n\nSo, in both possible arrangements, Kim sits 5 seats to the left of Tonya.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 5.\n\nBut let's double-check if there are any other possible interpretations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to ask for the number of seats between Kim and Tonya.\n\nIn that case, in both arrangements, there are 3 seats between them (positions 2,4,6 have 3 seats between 1 and 6, and similarly 3,5,7 have 3 seats between 2 and 7).\n\nBut the question specifically says \"how many seats to the left of Tonya does Kim sit?\", not \"how many seats are between Kim and Tonya.\"\n\nSo, interpreting it as the position difference seems more accurate.\n\nHence, the answer should be C. 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
