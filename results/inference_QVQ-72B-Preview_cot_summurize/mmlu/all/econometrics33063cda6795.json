                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these statements are true about a triangular or recursive system in econometrics. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to recall what I know.\n\nFirst off, a triangular or recursive system is a type of simultaneous equation model where the equations are ordered in such a way that each equation depends only on the variables that come before it in the system. This ordering helps to address issues of endogeneity by breaking down the system into a sequence of equations where each equation can be estimated separately under certain conditions.\n\nLet's look at each statement one by one.\n\n**Statement I:** The parameters can be validly estimated using separate applications of OLS to each equation.\n\nFrom what I remember, in a recursive system, because of the ordering, each equation can be estimated separately using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) without violating the assumptions of the classical linear regression model. This is because, in a recursive system, the error terms in each equation are uncorrelated with the explanatory variables in that equation due to the ordering. So, OLS should give consistent and unbiased estimates for each equation separately. Therefore, this statement seems true.\n\n**Statement II:** The independent variables may be correlated with the error terms in other equations.\n\nIn a recursive system, the structure is set up so that each equation's error term is not correlated with the explanatory variables in equations that come after it. However, it's possible for the error terms in different equations to be correlated with each other, especially if there are omitted variables that affect multiple equations. But in a well-specified recursive system, the ordering is supposed to minimize such correlations. I think this statement could be true in some cases, but perhaps it's not generally true in a properly specified recursive system. Maybe I need to think more carefully about this.\n\n**Statement III:** An application of 2SLS would lead to unbiased but inefficient parameter estimates.\n\nTwo-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) is a method used to estimate the parameters in models with endogenous explanatory variables. In a recursive system, since OLS can be used separately for each equation without endogeneity issues, applying 2SLS might not be necessary. However, if 2SLS is applied anyway, would it lead to unbiased but inefficient estimates?\n\nWell, in general, 2SLS is consistent and unbiased if the instruments are valid. However, in a recursive system, since OLS is already appropriate, using 2SLS might be overkill and could lead to less efficient estimates because 2SLS generally has larger variance than OLS when OLS is applicable. So, in this context, 2SLS would be unbiased but less efficient compared to OLS. Therefore, this statement seems true.\n\n**Statement IV:** The independent variables may be correlated with the error terms in the equations in which they appear as independent variables.\n\nIn a recursive system, the ordering of equations is such that variables in earlier equations are treated as exogenous in later equations. This means that in each equation, the explanatory variables should be uncorrelated with the error term due to the ordering. So, if the system is correctly specified as recursive, this correlation shouldn't exist. Therefore, this statement would be false.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Statement I: True\n\n- Statement II: Possibly true in some cases, but not generally in a well-specified recursive system.\n\n- Statement III: True\n\n- Statement IV: False\n\nSo, based on this, options B. (i) and (iii) only seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nI think the key points are that in a recursive system:\n\n- Each equation can be estimated separately using OLS without issues of endogeneity (Statement I).\n\n- 2SLS can be applied, but it would be less efficient compared to OLS (Statement III).\n\n- Correlation between independent variables and error terms in the same equation should not exist if the system is correctly specified as recursive (Statement IV should be false).\n\n- As for Statement II, while in a recursive system the error terms are supposed to be uncorrelated with the explanatory variables in the same equation, it's possible that they could be correlated across different equations, but this would suggest a misspecification of the system.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. (i) and (iii) only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
