                    "text": "Let's try to figure this out. So, Elsa values her time at $50 per hour, and she tutors David for two hours. David is willing to pay $175 for two hours of tutoring, but they settled on $125 for the entire two hours. I need to find out which statement about the transaction is true regarding consumer and producer surplus.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what consumer surplus and producer surplus are. Consumer surplus is the benefit a buyer gets from purchasing a good or service beyond its market price. Producer surplus is the benefit a seller gets from selling a good or service above their cost.\n\nSo, for David, the consumer, he was willing to pay $175 but only paid $125, so his consumer surplus is $175 - $125 = $50.\n\nFor Elsa, the producer, she values her time at $50 per hour, so for two hours, her cost is $100. She received $125 for two hours of tutoring, so her producer surplus is $125 - $100 = $25.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the relationship between consumer and producer surplus.\n\nOption A says consumer surplus is greater than producer surplus by between $50 and $75. Let's see: consumer surplus is $50 and producer surplus is $25, so the difference is $25. That's not between $50 and $75; it's exactly $25.\n\nOption B says producer surplus is greater than consumer surplus by between $50 and $75. But that's not the case because consumer surplus is larger by $25.\n\nOption C says consumer surplus is greater than producer surplus by more than $75. No, it's only $25.\n\nOption D says the difference between consumer and producer surplus is $25. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait a minute, but is there any other consideration I should make? Maybe I need to think about the total surplus or something else.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\nDavid's willingness to pay is $175 for two hours, and he pays $125, so consumer surplus is indeed $175 - $125 = $50.\n\nElsa's cost for two hours is $50/hour * 2 hours = $100, and she receives $125, so producer surplus is $125 - $100 = $25.\n\nThe difference between consumer surplus and producer surplus is $50 - $25 = $25.\n\nSo, option D seems correct: the difference between consumer and producer surplus is $25.\n\nBut let's make sure if there's any trick here.\n\nIs there any possibility that the valuation changes based on the hours or something like that?\n\nWait, no. The problem seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the per-hour rate for consumer surplus.\n\nWait, David's willingness to pay is $175 for two hours, so per hour he's willing to pay $87.50, but since the transaction is for two hours, the total willingness to pay is $175.\n\nSimilarly, Elsa's cost is $50 per hour, so for two hours, it's $100.\n\nThe price agreed is $125 for two hours, which is $62.50 per hour.\n\nSo, consumer surplus is total willingness to pay minus total price paid: $175 - $125 = $50.\n\nProducer surplus is total revenue minus total cost: $125 - $100 = $25.\n\nDifference: $50 - $25 = $25.\n\nYes, that matches option D.\n\nI don't think there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The difference between consumer and producer surplus is $25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
