                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"How much current does a 60 W light bulb draw if it operates at a voltage of 120 V?\" And there are four options to choose from: A. 0.25 A, B. 0.5 A, C. 2.00 A, D. 4.00 A.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall the relationship between power, voltage, and current. I remember that power is equal to voltage multiplied by current, right? So, P = V * I.\n\nIn this case, the power P is 60 watts, and the voltage V is 120 volts. I need to find the current I.\n\nSo, rearranging the formula to solve for current, I get I = P / V.\n\nPlugging in the values, I have I = 60 W / 120 V.\n\nLet me calculate that: 60 divided by 120.\n\nWell, 60 divided by 120 is the same as 0.5 amps.\n\nSo, that would make the current 0.5 amperes.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 0.5 A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the resistance of the light bulb.\n\nUsing Ohm's law, V = I * R, and also P = V^2 / R.\n\nIf I know P and V, I can find R, and then find I.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFirst, R = V^2 / P.\n\nSo, R = (120 V)^2 / 60 W = 14400 / 60 = 240 ohms.\n\nThen, I = V / R = 120 V / 240 ohms = 0.5 amps.\n\nOkay, so again, I get 0.5 amps.\n\nThat confirms my initial calculation.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nIs the voltage constant? Yes, it's 120 V.\n\nIs the power 60 W? Yes.\n\nAre there any other factors to consider, like the efficiency of the bulb or anything like that?\n\nWell, in real life, light bulbs might not be 100% efficient, but for the purposes of this problem, I think we can assume that the rated power is the power consumed, and that's what we're using.\n\nSo, no need to account for efficiency here.\n\nWhat about the units? Watts, volts, amps\u2014are these all consistent?\n\nYes, P is in watts, V is in volts, I is in amps.\n\nNo issues there.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if the voltage is RMS or peak value for AC current, but since the problem says \"operates at a voltage of 120 V,\" and doesn't specify, I think it's safe to assume it's the operating voltage, which is typically RMS for AC circuits.\n\nBut in any case, without more information, I'll proceed with the given values.\n\nSo, based on both methods I used, I arrive at 0.5 amps.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. 0.5 A.\n\nJust to make sure, let me check the other options quickly.\n\nA. 0.25 A\u2014that would be if I mistakenly divided 60 by 240, but no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nC. 2.00 A\u2014that would be if I multiplied 60 by 2, but that's not right.\n\nD. 4.00 A\u2014that's even higher; doesn't seem plausible for a 60 W bulb on 120 V.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that B. 0.5 A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 0.5\\ A} \\]"
