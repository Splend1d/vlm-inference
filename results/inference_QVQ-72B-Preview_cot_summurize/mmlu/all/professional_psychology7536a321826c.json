                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario here. I'm a psychologist, and I've just started seeing a new client, Hermann H., who's 28 years old. He reached out because he's feeling \"totally miserable\" due to a recent breakup with his girlfriend and wants to start therapy with me. During our first session, I find out that his political views are completely repugnant to me, and honestly, I'm not sure if I can work with him effectively because of that.\n\nSo, as an ethical psychologist, what should I do? The options are:\n\nA. Consult with another psychologist during the course of treatment to make sure my feelings don't interfere with my objectivity.\n\nB. Discuss the difference in political views with Hermann only if they become relevant to the psychotherapy process.\n\nC. See Hermann in therapy until his current crisis is over and then make a referral if necessary.\n\nD. Provide Hermann with appropriate referrals right away.\n\nHmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that as a psychologist, I'm supposed to be objective and unbiased. My personal feelings shouldn't influence the therapy process. But in reality, we're all human, and sometimes our clients' views or behaviors can trigger us.\n\nIn this case, Hermann's political views are completely repugnant to me. That's a strong emotion, and I need to handle it responsibly.\n\nOption A suggests consulting with another psychologist to ensure that my feelings don't interfere with my objectivity. That sounds like a good idea. Maybe talking to a colleague can help me process my reactions and find ways to set aside my personal feelings during sessions with Hermann.\n\nOption B says to discuss the difference in political views with Hermann only if they become relevant to the psychotherapy process. Well, his political views came up in the first session, so apparently, they are relevant to some extent. But I'm not sure if bringing up the difference in our views would be helpful or potentially create more tension.\n\nOption C proposes seeing Hermann until his current crisis is over and then making a referral if necessary. This seems like a compassionate approach, ensuring that he gets the help he needs during his time of distress before potentially referring him to another therapist who might not have the same issues with his political views.\n\nOption D is to provide appropriate referrals right away. That seems pretty drastic. Hermann came to me for help, and I haven't even given it a chance yet. Maybe there's a way I can work through my feelings and still provide effective therapy.\n\nLet me consider the ethical principles here. The American Psychological Association's Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct emphasize the importance of benefiting clients and avoiding harm (Principle A: Beneficence and Nonmaleficence). Also, we're supposed to be competent in the services we provide (Principle C: Integrity) and maintain respect for people's rights and dignity (Principle D: Justice).\n\nSo, if I proceed with therapy despite my strong negative feelings towards Hermann's political views, might I unintentionally harm him by letting my biases influence the therapy? That would violate Principle A.\n\nOn the other hand, if I refer him to another therapist immediately, am I failing to provide him with the necessary support during his crisis, which would also violate Principle A?\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should try to work through my feelings first before making any decisions. Consulting with a colleague, as option A suggests, could help me understand how to manage my reactions and ensure that I'm providing ethical and effective therapy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should have an open conversation with Hermann about our differing political views and see how he feels about it. Maybe he would prefer to see another therapist who shares his views or at least doesn't find them repugnant.\n\nBut what if he doesn't want to switch therapists? What if he's comfortable with me despite our differences?\n\nAnother thought: maybe our political views won't really impact the therapy process, especially since the main issue is his breakup with his girlfriend. Maybe I can focus on that and avoid discussing politics altogether.\n\nHowever, since Hermann brought up his political views in the first session, it seems like it might be a significant part of his identity or worldview, which could be relevant to his relationships and the breakup.\n\nI need to think about what's best for Hermann. He's the one who's suffering, and I need to put his well-being first.\n\nPerhaps the most ethical course of action is to be honest with him about my discomfort with his political views and see if we can work together despite our differences. If it becomes too difficult for either of us, then referring him to another therapist would be the next step.\n\nBut I'm not sure if I'm capable of setting aside my strong negative reactions to his views. It might be unfair to him if I can't provide unbiased support.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider cultural competence here. As a psychologist, I should be able to work with clients from diverse backgrounds, including those with different political ideologies. If I'm not able to do that, perhaps I'm not the right therapist for Hermann.\n\nOption C suggests seeing him through his current crisis and then making a referral if necessary. That might be a middle ground. I can help him through this immediate difficult time and then refer him to another therapist who might be better equipped to handle his political views in the long term.\n\nBut what if my biases start affecting our relationship even during the crisis phase? Could that make things worse for him?\n\nI need to think about the potential risks and benefits of each option.\n\nIf I choose option A and consult with another psychologist, I might be able to work through my feelings and provide effective therapy without letting my personal views interfere.\n\nOption B suggests only discussing our differences if they become relevant to the therapy process. But they already have, since he mentioned them in the first session. Maybe I need to address them sooner rather than later to establish clear boundaries and understanding.\n\nOption C allows me to help him through his immediate needs and then refer him out, which could be seen as responsible and client-centered.\n\nOption D is to refer him right away, which might be the safest choice to avoid any potential harm caused by my personal biases.\n\nBut referring him immediately might not be the best for his well-being, especially if he's in crisis. He might need continuity of care and support right now.\n\nMaybe I should try to work with him for a few sessions, focusing solely on his breakup, and see how things go. If I find that my feelings towards his political views are interfering with our therapy relationship, then I can discuss referral options with him.\n\nThat sounds like a plan. I can set some boundaries for myself, perhaps agreeing not to discuss politics unless Hermann brings it up in a way that's directly relevant to his current issues.\n\nI should also reflect on my own biases and try to understand why his views are so repugnant to me. Maybe there's something I can learn from this experience about my own prejudices and how to work through them.\n\nAdditionally, I could consider seeking supervision from a more experienced psychologist who has dealt with similar situations. That might provide me with guidance and support in navigating this challenging situation.\n\nAnother angle to consider is that Hermann might be using his political views as a way to test me or to see if I accept him fully. If that's the case, acknowledging our differences and expressing my commitment to helping him despite them could be beneficial for our therapeutic alliance.\n\nOn the other hand, if I refer him to another therapist right away, he might feel rejected or that I'm not willing to work with someone who has different political views. That could reinforce feelings of isolation or mistrust towards mental health professionals.\n\nI need to balance my own well-being as a therapist with Hermann's needs as a client. If continuing therapy with him is going to cause me significant distress or compromise my objectivity, then referral might be the best option.\n\nPerhaps I should have an honest conversation with Hermann about my discomfort with his political views and see how he feels about continuing therapy with me. He might appreciate my honesty and decide to stay, or he might prefer to find someone else.\n\nBut what if he feels pressured to change his views or feels judged by me? That could be harmful.\n\nI need to handle this with sensitivity and professionalism.\n\nLet me think about the ethical guidelines again. The APA's Ethics Code emphasizes respect for people's rights and dignity, and the importance of avoiding harm to clients.\n\nIf I proceed with therapy while harboring strong negative feelings towards Hermann's political views, there's a risk that those feelings could influence our sessions in negative ways, such as through nonverbal cues, tone of voice, or therapeutic decisions.\n\nTo minimize that risk, perhaps I should seek supervision or consultation, as option A suggests. A supervisor could help me process my emotions and develop strategies to maintain objectivity and professionalism during sessions.\n\nOption C, continuing therapy through the crisis and then referring if necessary, also seems reasonable. I could focus on helping Hermann cope with his breakup and related emotions, while minimizing discussion of political views unless they directly relate to his current situation.\n\nIf, during this period, I find that my feelings are still too strong and are affecting our therapy, I could then discuss referral options with Hermann, explaining that I believe he would be better served by a therapist who doesn't have the same level of discomfort with his political views.\n\nThis approach allows me to provide immediate support during his crisis while also being honest about my limitations as his therapist.\n\nI should also consider whether there are any legal implications or specific ethical guidelines in my state or country regarding working with clients who hold repugnant views.\n\nIn any case, I need to act in Hermann's best interests, maintaining confidentiality and professionalism throughout.\n\nMaybe I should also reflect on whether my discomfort is based on factual information or just on my personal prejudices. If Hermann's political views are associated with harmful ideologies or behaviors, that might be a different situation from if they're simply different from mine in a benign way.\n\nFor example, if his views involve hate speech, discrimination, or other unethical or illegal activities, that changes the dynamic. However, the scenario doesn't specify the nature of his political views, only that they're repugnant to me.\n\nAssuming that his views are not in themselves harmful to others, I should try to set aside my personal feelings and provide him with the same level of care and respect that I would offer any other client.\n\nIn summary, I think the most ethical course of action is to:\n\n1. Acknowledge my discomfort and seek supervision or consultation to process my feelings and develop strategies to manage them.\n\n2. Continue therapy with Hermann, focusing on his current crisis and relationship issues, while minimizing discussion of political views unless they're directly relevant to his situation.\n\n3. Monitor my own reactions and the therapy progress. If I find that my feelings are still interfering with our therapy relationship or if Hermann expresses discomfort with our differences, then discuss referral options with him.\n\n4. Ensure that Hermann receives continuous support during any transition to a new therapist.\n\nSo, among the given options, I would lean towards option C: see Hermann in therapy until his current crisis is over and then make a referral if necessary.\n\nHowever, I also think that option A, consulting with another psychologist during the course of treatment, is an important step to ensure that my feelings don't interfere with my objectivity.\n\nCombining elements of both options A and C might be the best approach in this situation.\n\nBut since I have to choose one primary action, I'll go with option C, with the understanding that I'll also be seeking supervision or consultation to manage my reactions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
