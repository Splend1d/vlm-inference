                    "text": "So I've got this function:\n\n$$f(x) = \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{1+\\frac 1x}}.$$\n\nAnd I need to find the three real numbers that are not in the domain of this function, and then find the sum of those three numbers.\n\nFirst off, I know that the domain of a function consists of all the real numbers for which the function is defined. For rational functions like this one, the points where the denominator is zero are excluded from the domain.\n\nLooking at the function, there are multiple denominators:\n\n1. The outermost denominator: \\(1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{x}}\\)\n\n2. The denominator inside: \\(1 + \\frac{1}{x}\\)\n\n3. The innermost denominator: \\(x\\)\n\nSo, to find the values of \\(x\\) not in the domain, I need to find where any of these denominators is zero, because division by zero is undefined.\n\nLet's start with the innermost denominator:\n\n1. \\(x = 0\\)\n\nThis is straightforward. If \\(x = 0\\), the function involves division by zero right away.\n\nNow, moving to the next denominator:\n\n2. \\(1 + \\frac{1}{x} = 0\\)\n\nLet's solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{x} = -1 \\\\\nx = -1\n\\]\n\nSo, when \\(x = -1\\), this part of the denominator is zero, which would make the function undefined.\n\nNext, the outermost denominator:\n\n3. \\(1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{x}} = 0\\)\n\nThis one is a bit trickier. Let's solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{x}} = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{x}} = -1 \\\\\n1 + \\frac{1}{x} = -1 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{x} = -2 \\\\\nx = -\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, when \\(x = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), this part of the denominator is zero.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to be careful here. Actually, if the denominator is zero, the expression becomes undefined. So, these are the points not in the domain.\n\nBut, I should check if there are any other points where the function is undefined. For example, if there are points where the numerator is zero, but in this case, the function is always of the form 1 over something, so it's only undefined where the denominator is zero.\n\nSo, the three points not in the domain are \\(x = 0\\), \\(x = -1\\), and \\(x = -\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of these three numbers:\n\n\\[\n0 + (-1) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -1 - \\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option C is -1.5, which is -3/2, but option D is -1.\n\nDid I miss something?\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, \\(x = 0\\) is clear.\n\nSecond, \\(1 + \\frac{1}{x} = 0\\) gives \\(x = -1\\), that seems correct.\n\nThird, \\(1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{x}} = 0\\).\n\nLet me solve this step by step.\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{x}} = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{x}} = -1 \\\\\n1 + \\frac{1}{x} = -1 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{x} = -2 \\\\\nx = -\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, sum: \\(0 + (-1) + (-0.5) = -1.5\\), which is -3/2.\n\nBut looking at the options, -1.5 is option C, and -1 is option D. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.\n\nWait, no, it's straightforward: 0 + (-1) + (-1/2) = -3/2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another value that I missed.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other values of \\(x\\) that make any denominator zero.\n\nWait, in the expression \\(1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{x}}\\), the denominator is \\(1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{x}}\\), so setting that equal to zero gave \\(x = -1/2\\).\n\nBut maybe I need to consider if \\(1 + \\frac{1}{x} = 0\\) already covers \\(x = -1\\), and \\(x = 0\\) is already covered, and \\(x = -1/2\\) is the third one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me try to simplify the expression:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{x}}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{x}}{1 + \\frac{1}{x}}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{x} + 1}{1 + \\frac{1}{x}}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\frac{x + 1 + x}{x}}{1 + \\frac{1}{x}}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\frac{2x + 1}{x}}{1 + \\frac{1}{x}}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{2x + 1}{x} \\cdot \\frac{x}{x + 1}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{2x + 1}{x + 1}} = \\frac{x + 1}{2x + 1}\n\\]\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, simplifying the function, we get:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{x + 1}{2x + 1}\n\\]\n\nNow, the domain of this simplified function is all real numbers except where the denominator is zero, which is:\n\n\\[\n2x + 1 = 0 \\\\\nx = -\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nBut wait, the original function had more restrictions because of the nested denominators.\n\nSo, even though algebraically simplifying gives \\(f(x) = \\frac{x + 1}{2x + 1}\\), the domain of the original function is more restricted.\n\nTherefore, I need to consider the original expression's domain, not just the simplified form.\n\nSo, going back, the points not in the domain are \\(x = 0\\), \\(x = -1\\), and \\(x = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), as previously found.\n\nSumming them up: \\(0 + (-1) + (-\\frac{1}{2}) = -\\frac{3}{2}\\), which is -1.5.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 1\n\nB. 0\n\nC. -1.5\n\nD. -1\n\nSo, option C is -1.5, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake because the problem might be expecting a different answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed another point where the function is undefined.\n\nLet me check if there are any other values of \\(x\\) that make any denominator zero.\n\nWe already have:\n\n1. \\(x = 0\\)\n\n2. \\(1 + \\frac{1}{x} = 0\\) leading to \\(x = -1\\)\n\n3. \\(1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{x}} = 0\\) leading to \\(x = -\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nAre there any other places where the function is undefined?\n\nWait, in the expression \\(1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{x}}\\), if \\(1 + \\frac{1}{x} = 0\\), we already covered that with \\(x = -1\\).\n\nBut perhaps there are other values where the denominator becomes zero through some other path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider if \\(1 + \\frac{1}{x} = a\\), and then \\(1 + \\frac{1}{a} = 0\\), leading to \\(a = -1\\), which corresponds to \\(x = -1\\), as already found.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think recursively.\n\nLet me consider the innermost expression: \\(x\\). It's zero when \\(x = 0\\).\n\nNext, \\(1 + \\frac{1}{x}\\). It's zero when \\(x = -1\\).\n\nThen, \\(1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{x}}\\). It's zero when \\(x = -\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nAre there any other places where the denominator could be zero?\n\nWait, in the expression \\(1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{x}}\\), if \\(1 + \\frac{1}{x} = b\\), then the denominator becomes \\(1 + \\frac{1}{b}\\).\n\nSo, \\(b = 1 + \\frac{1}{x}\\), and \\(1 + \\frac{1}{b} = 0\\) implies \\(b = -1\\), which gives \\(1 + \\frac{1}{x} = -1\\), leading to \\(x = -1\\), which we already have.\n\nAlternatively, if \\(b = 0\\), then \\(1 + \\frac{1}{x} = 0\\), again \\(x = -1\\).\n\nSo, it seems like there are no additional points where the denominator is zero.\n\nTherefore, the three points not in the domain are \\(x = 0\\), \\(x = -1\\), and \\(x = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), and their sum is \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\), which is -1.5.\n\nSo, the answer should be option C: -1.5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-1.5} \\]"
