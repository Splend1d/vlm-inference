                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving Loretta Landlord and Sally Sleazy. Loretta owns a commercial building, and one of her spaces was rented by a dance troop for $500 a month. The director of the troop moved to New York, the troop dissolved, and the space became vacant. Then Sally came along, rented the space for $1,000 a month under a two-year lease, but didn't tell Loretta that she planned to open a topless strip club. One month after opening, the county passed a law banning topless strip joints in the neighborhood. Sally said the new law made it impossible to run her business, so she's leaving. Now, if Loretta sues Sally for breaching the lease contract, what's the likely outcome?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand the concept of impossibility of performance in contract law. Impossibility of performance is a defense that can be used when an unforeseen event occurs after the contract is formed, making performance objectively impossible. It's not just about it being difficult or less profitable; it has to be literally impossible to perform the contractual obligations.\n\nIn this case, Sally rented the space intending to open a topless strip club. After she started operating, a new law was passed prohibiting such businesses in the neighborhood. So, Sally is arguing that because of this law, she can't legally operate her business as intended, hence it's impossible to continue paying rent for a space she can't use for her intended purpose.\n\nNow, Loretta is probably arguing that Sally still has to pay the rent regardless of what she's using the space for, since they have a lease agreement. But Sally's position is that the lease is discharged due to impossibility of performance because the primary purpose of the lease\u2014operating a topless strip club\u2014is now illegal in the area.\n\nLet me think about this. If the law makes it illegal to operate a topless strip club in the neighborhood, then Sally can't use the space for that purpose anymore. But does that mean she's excused from paying the rent? What if she finds another lawful use for the space?\n\nWait, the lease was for a specific purpose, right? No, actually, the lease was for the space, and Sally didn't disclose her intended use. So, the lease doesn't specify the use beyond general commercial use, I assume. But then, if the intended use is now illegal, does that affect her obligation to pay rent?\n\nI recall that in some cases, if the primary purpose of the lease is frustrated by external events, the lessee might be discharged from the contract. But in this scenario, the lease was for a two-year term, and only one month has passed. So, there's still almost two years left on the lease.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that Sally didn't disclose her intended use to Loretta when she signed the lease. If Loretta had known about the intended use, she might not have rented the space, or she might have charged a higher rent, or added conditions to the lease. So, there's an issue of misrepresentation or nondisclosure here.\n\nBut, assuming that the lease doesn't prohibit the use Sally intended, and that the law change occurred after the lease was signed, Sally might have a valid defense of impossibility.\n\nWait, but the law change was after the lease was signed, which is typically when impossibility can be claimed. If something happens after the contract is formed that makes performance impossible, the party affected can be excused from performance.\n\nHowever, I also remember that the impossibility has to be permanent or at least for a significant portion of the contract term. In this case, the law bans topless strip clubs in the neighborhood, so Sally can't operate her business there anymore. But what if she wants to use the space for another purpose? Would that be allowed under the lease?\n\nIf the lease is for general commercial use, and Sally can find another business to operate there, then perhaps she's still obligated to pay rent even if she can't use it for her original purpose. But if the space is only suitable for her specific use, and no other business can operate there due to the new law, then her position is stronger for claiming impossibility.\n\nAlso, I should consider whether the new law applies retroactively. If it only applies to new businesses, then maybe Sally could still operate, but I think the problem states that the law prohibits topless strip joints in the neighborhood, and since Sally's is already there, it might be grandfathered in, or it might be subject to the new law.\n\nBut the problem says that Sally told Loretta that the new law made it impossible to operate the business, so presumably, the law affects her operation.\n\nNow, from Loretta's perspective, she's losing a tenant who was paying $1,000 a month, and she might have to find a new tenant. If Sally stops paying rent, Loretta would suffer a financial loss.\n\nBut legally, if Sally can prove that the new law makes her use of the space impossible, then she might be excused from further performance under the doctrine of impossibility.\n\nOn the other hand, if the lease requires Sally to pay rent regardless of whether she uses the space or not, and there's no clause allowing her to terminate early due to changes in law, then Loretta might still be entitled to the rent.\n\nI think the key here is whether the new law makes the primary purpose of the lease impossible, and if that purpose was known or could be inferred.\n\nGiven that Sally didn't disclose her intended use, Loretta might argue that the lease was for general commercial use, and that Sally can still use the space for other lawful purposes.\n\nBut Sally's position is that her specific use is now illegal, and therefore, she can't operate her business there, making it impossible for her to continue paying rent for a space she can't use as intended.\n\nI need to think about case law on this. There are cases where changes in law after the contract is formed lead to impossibility of performance.\n\nFor example, if a business rents a space for a specific legal use, and then the law changes to make that use illegal, the lessee might be excused from further performance.\n\nBut in this case, the lease was for a two-year term, and only one month has passed. So, Sally has almost two years left on the lease.\n\nIf Sally can't operate her business there due to the new law, and if she can't find another lawful use for the space, then her position is stronger.\n\nHowever, if the space can be used for other commercial purposes that are still lawful, then she might still be obligated to pay rent, even if she doesn't use the space.\n\nBut if the space is only suitable for her specific use, and no other business can operate there due to the new law, then her claim of impossibility is stronger.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify that the space is only suitable for a topless strip club. It just says it's a commercial space in a commercial strip surrounded by a residential community.\n\nSo, presumably, other types of businesses could operate there, unless the new law has broader restrictions.\n\nBut the problem specifically mentions that the county commissioners passed a new law prohibiting topless strip joints in that neighborhood.\n\nSo, unless the law has broader restrictions, other businesses should still be able to operate there.\n\nTherefore, Sally can't use the space for her intended purpose, but other businesses could.\n\nFrom that perspective, Sally's specific use is impossible due to the new law, but the space itself isn't rendered completely useless.\n\nDoes that affect her obligation to pay rent? I think it does.\n\nBecause even if she can't use the space for her intended purpose, she still has the obligation to pay rent for the lease term, unless the lease allows otherwise.\n\nBut she might sublease it to another business that can operate there lawfully.\n\nIf she can't find another tenant, then she's still obligated to pay rent.\n\nUnless the new law makes it impossible for any business to operate there, which doesn't seem to be the case, then her obligation likely remains.\n\nSo, in this scenario, since the new law only prohibits topless strip clubs, and other businesses can still operate there, Sally is probably still obligated to pay rent for the remainder of the lease term.\n\nTherefore, if Loretta sues Sally for breach of the lease contract, the likely outcome is a judgment for Loretta, because the new law was passed after the lease was executed, and other lawful uses are still possible for the space.\n\nWait, but option A says Sally wins because the law made performance impossible.\n\nOption B says Loretta wins because the new law was passed after the lease was executed.\n\nOption C says Loretta wins only if she didn't know of Sally's intended use.\n\nOption D says Sally wins because the lease contract was discharged under impossibility of performance.\n\nBased on my reasoning, I think option B is correct: Loretta wins because the new law was passed after the lease was executed, and other lawful uses are still possible for the space.\n\nBut option D seems similar, saying the lease contract was discharged under impossibility of performance, which would favor Sally.\n\nHowever, I think that's not accurate because other uses are still possible.\n\nSo, I believe the correct answer is option B: Loretta, because the new law was passed after the lease was executed.\n\nWait, but option C says Loretta wins only if she didn't know of Sally's intended use.\n\nBut in this scenario, Sally didn't disclose her intended use to Loretta, so Loretta didn't know.\n\nSo, if Loretta didn't know about the intended use, and the lease is for general commercial use, then Sally is still obligated to pay rent even if she can't use it for her specific purpose.\n\nTherefore, option C seems partially correct, but it's phrased as \"only if she did not know of the use Sally intended for the space.\"\n\nGiven that Sally didn't disclose her intended use, Loretta didn't know, so option C would apply.\n\nBut I think the main reason is that the new law was passed after the lease was executed, and other lawful uses are still possible.\n\nSo, perhaps option B is the best answer.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the lease is for general commercial use, and Sally's specific use is now illegal due to the new law, but other uses are still possible, then Sally is still obligated to pay rent unless she can sublease it.\n\nTherefore, Loretta should win the judgment, which aligns with option B.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. Loretta, because the new law was passed after the lease was executed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
