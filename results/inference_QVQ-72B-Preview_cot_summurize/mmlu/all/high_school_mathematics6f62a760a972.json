The options are 9, 27, 36, and 34. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to simplify the left side of the equation. The numerator is \\(4^{(3^3)}\\), which means \\(4^{27}\\), because \\(3^3 = 27\\). So, \\(4^{27}\\).\n\nThe denominator is \\((4^3)^3\\). I remember that when you have an exponent raised to another exponent, you multiply the exponents. So, \\(4^3\\) raised to the 3rd power is \\(4^{9}\\).\n\nNow, the left side becomes \\(\\frac{4^{27}}{4^{9}}\\). I recall that when dividing similar bases, I subtract the exponents. So, \\(\\frac{4^{27}}{4^{9}} = 4^{27 - 9} = 4^{18}\\).\n\nNext, I have \\(4^{18}\\) equals \\(2^N\\). I need to relate these two bases. I know that 4 is \\(2^2\\), so I can rewrite \\(4^{18}\\) in terms of base 2.\n\nSo, \\(4^{18} = (2^2)^{18} = 2^{2 \\times 18} = 2^{36}\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(2^{36} = 2^N\\). Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. So, \\(N = 36\\).\n\nLet me just double-check that. Starting from the original equation:\n\n\\(\\frac{4^{(3^3)}}{(4^3)^3} = 2^N\\)\n\nFirst, \\(3^3 = 27\\), so \\(4^{27}\\) in the numerator.\n\nDenominator: \\((4^3)^3 = 4^{9}\\).\n\nThen, \\(\\frac{4^{27}}{4^{9}} = 4^{18}\\).\n\nAnd since \\(4 = 2^2\\), \\(4^{18} = (2^2)^{18} = 2^{36}\\).\n\nSo, \\(2^{36} = 2^N\\) implies \\(N = 36\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. The answer should be 36.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]"
