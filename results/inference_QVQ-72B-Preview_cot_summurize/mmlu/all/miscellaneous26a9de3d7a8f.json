                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"According to a popular slogan, what state should people not 'mess with'?\" And the options are New York, Texas, Montana, and Rhode Island. Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out which one of these states has a slogan that warns people not to mess with it.\n\nFirst off, I know that slogans are like mottos or taglines that represent a state's identity or culture. They're often used in tourism campaigns or to evoke a sense of pride among the residents. In this case, the question is referring to a slogan that suggests people shouldn't mess with a particular state, implying that it's tough or has a reputation for being strong and unyielding.\n\nLet me think about this. I remember hearing the phrase \"Don't Mess with Texas\" before. It sounds familiar, and I think it's associated with Texas. Texas is known for its size, its independent spirit, and its cowboy culture, which might lend itself to such a slogan.\n\nBut let me consider each option one by one to make sure.\n\nStarting with New York. New York is a big state with a lot of influence, especially New York City, which is a global hub for finance, culture, and fashion. I've heard phrases like \"The City That Never Sleeps\" or \"The Big Apple,\" but nothing that specifically says \"Don't Mess with New York.\" So, maybe not New York.\n\nNext is Texas. As I thought earlier, \"Don't Mess with Texas\" does ring a bell. I think it was even a successful anti-litter campaign in the 1980s, featuring famous Texans encouraging people to keep the state clean. So, that seems to fit the bill.\n\nThen there's Montana. Montana is known for its natural beauty, like Glacier National Park and Yellowstone, and its vast open spaces. I don't recall any slogans about not messing with Montana. Maybe something like \"Big Sky Country,\" but that's more about the landscape than a warning.\n\nLastly, Rhode Island. Rhode Island is the smallest state in the United States, known for being one of the original thirteen colonies and for places like Providence and Newport. I can't think of any slogans related to not messing with Rhode Island. It seems too small and peaceful for that kind of imagery.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like Texas is the most likely answer. Not only do I recall the \"Don't Mess with Texas\" slogan, but it also fits the attitude of toughness and independence that the state is known for.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll see if any of the other states have similar slogans that might fit the description.\n\nNew York: As I thought, slogans like \"I Love New York\" or \"The Empire State\" are more common, but nothing about not messing with it.\n\nMontana: Their official state motto is \"O Montanans, Be Not Afraid,\" which is quite inspirational, but not exactly a warning to others.\n\nRhode Island: The state motto is \"Hope,\" which is embodied in their seal and flag, again nothing suggestive of a warning against messing with them.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is Texas, with the slogan \"Don't Mess with Texas.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B.
