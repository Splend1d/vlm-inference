Rhodesia, D. Belgian Congo. Hmm, I need to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on my African history, but let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Democratic Republic of Congo is a country in Central Africa. It's been through a lot of name changes over the years, so this question is probably testing my knowledge of its recent history. Let me think about the timeline.\n\nI recall that the country was formerly known as Zaire under Mobutu Sese Seko's dictatorship. Wait, was that during the period from 1971 to 1997? Let me confirm that. Mobutu came to power in 1965, I think, and renamed the country Zaire in 1971. Then, in 1997, after he was overthrown, the country went back to being called Congo, or more specifically, the Democratic Republic of Congo. So, yeah, from 1971 to 1997, it was Zaire.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's double-check. The Democratic Republic of Congo was originally Belgian Congo before independence in 1960. After independence, it was briefly the Republic of Congo, then Zaire, and then back to Congo. So, yes, during that specified period, it was Zaire.\n\nWait a minute, one of the options is Angola. Angola is another country in Southern Africa, not Central Africa. I don't think Angola was ever called Zaire or Congo. It was a Portuguese colony until 1975 and then became independent as Angola. So, that seems like an unrelated option.\n\nThen there's Rhodesia. That was a former white-minority-ruled territory in Southern Africa, which became Zimbabwe after independence. So, again, that's a different country and not related to the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nLastly, Belgian Congo. That was the name before independence in 1960. So, that would be before 1960, not from 1971 to 1997.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Zaire.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there were any other name changes within that period. No, I don't think so. Mobutu renamed it Zaire in 1971, and it remained Zaire until he was ousted in 1997, when it reverted to the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The answer is A. Zaire.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Zaire}} \\]"
