In order to facilitate the access to the cottage, which is located on a knoll above the lake, the wedding planner entered into an agreement with a neighbor, an adjoining land owner, whereby the neighbor, in writing, granted the wedding planner a right-of-way over a strip of land 30 feet in width and a quarter of a mile in length along the eastern margin of the neighbor's property. Without notif'ing the neighbor, the wedding planner proceeded with his plan to improve the roadbed by having the road asphalted in order to make it more accessible for motor vehicle traffic. Several years later, the neighbor started a sand business, which required him to do heavy hauling that subsequently destroyed the asphalted surface on the road. Ten years after the neighbor started his sand business, the wedding planner sold his lakefront property to an artist. Shortly after the artist took possession of the cottage and property, the neighbor erected wooden barriers across the roadway, thus obstructing the access to the artist's property. The interest that the wedding planner acquired in the access road may best be described as\n\nA. an easement in gross.\nB. an easement implied by prior use.\nC. an easement by necessity.\nD. an express easement.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a wedding planner who owns a summer cottage on the lake and makes an agreement with a neighboring landowner for a right-of-way. Then, the wedding planner sells the cottage to an artist, and the neighbor puts up barriers blocking access to the artist's property. The question is asking what kind of interest the wedding planner acquired in the access road, and the options are an easement in gross, an easement implied by prior use, an easement by necessity, or an express easement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each type of easement is:\n\n1. **Easement in gross:** This is an easement that benefits an individual or entity directly, rather than a particular piece of land. It's personal to the owner and isn't attached to the land.\n\n2. **Easement implied by prior use:** This type of easement is created when there's a long-standing use of a path or way that was necessary for the enjoyment of a property before it was divided. It's implied from the prior use and the layout of the properties.\n\n3. **Easement by necessity:** This is an easement that's created when a property is landlocked and has no access to a public road. It's necessary for the reasonable use and enjoyment of the property.\n\n4. **Express easement:** This is an easement that's explicitly granted in a written agreement, such as a deed or contract, and is usually recorded.\n\nNow, let's look at the scenario:\n\n- The wedding planner owns a cottage on the lake, located on a knoll above it.\n\n- He enters into an agreement with a neighboring landowner who grants him a right-of-way over a specific strip of land (30 feet wide and a quarter-mile long) along the eastern margin of the neighbor's property.\n\n- This agreement is in writing.\n\n- The wedding planner improves the road by asphalt without notifying the neighbor.\n\n- The neighbor starts a sand business years later, which destroys the asphalted surface.\n\n- Ten years after starting the sand business, the wedding planner sells the lakefront property to an artist.\n\n- Shortly after, the neighbor puts up barriers blocking access to the artist's property.\n\nFrom this, it seems like the wedding planner had an agreement in writing with the neighbor granting him a right-of-way. This sounds like an express easement because it's explicitly granted in writing.\n\nBut let's consider if it could be any of the other types:\n\n- **Easement in gross:** If the wedding planner had personal rights to use the road, not tied to the property, it might be an easement in gross. However, typically, when a property owner has a right-of-way for access to their land, it's appurtenant to the land, meaning it's attached to the property and passes with it when the property is sold.\n\n- **Easement implied by prior use:** This would require a history of use before the properties were divided, and that the use was necessary for the enjoyment of the property. In this scenario, there's no mention of the properties being divided or any prior use before the agreement.\n\n- **Easement by necessity:** This would require that the wedding planner's property is landlocked and has no other access to a public road. The scenario doesn't specify if the property is landlocked or not. However, since they have a right-of-way to the lake, it suggests that access to the lake is important, but it's not clear if this is the only access to the property.\n\nGiven that there's a written agreement granting a right-of-way, it seems most straightforward to conclude that this is an express easement. The fact that the wedding planner improved the road by asphalting it without notifying the neighbor might be a separate issue regarding the scope of the easement or potential overuse, but it doesn't change the nature of the original interest.\n\nMoreover, when the wedding planner sold the property to the artist, the easement should have passed with the property if it's appurtenant, unless specified otherwise. The neighbor erecting barriers suggests a dispute over the continued existence or scope of the easement, but that's a different matter from what type of easement was originally granted.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D. an express easement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
