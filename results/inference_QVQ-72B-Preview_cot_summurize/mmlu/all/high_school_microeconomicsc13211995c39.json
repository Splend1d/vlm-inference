Quantity supplied of pears falls.\n\nC. Quantity demanded of pears falls.\n\nD. Demand for pears falls.\n\nHmm, I need to recall some basic economics principles here. I remember that there's a difference between demand and quantity demanded, and the same for supply and quantity supplied. That's probably important here.\n\nFirst, let's think about the relationship between price and quantity demanded. Generally, when the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded decreases. That makes sense because people are less willing to buy something when it costs more, right? So, option C seems plausible.\n\nBut wait, option D says that demand for pears falls. Is that the same as quantity demanded? No, I think demand refers to the entire relationship between prices and quantities, not just one specific quantity at a given price. So, if the price increases, demand might not necessarily fall; maybe other factors are at play.\n\nLet me consider quantity supplied. If the price of pears increases, producers might be encouraged to supply more, right? So, quantity supplied should rise, not fall. That means option B might be incorrect.\n\nSo, between options A and C, which one is correct? Option A says quantity demanded rises, but that seems counterintuitive. If the price goes up, shouldn't people buy less? Maybe there's a special case where that happens, but generally, it's the opposite.\n\nOption C says quantity demanded falls when price increases. That sounds like the law of demand. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nOption D says demand for pears falls. Wait, that's different from quantity demanded. Demand is the whole curve, not just one point on it. So, if the price increases, and assuming other things remain the same, the demand curve shouldn't shift. It's the quantity demanded that changes along the curve.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is C. Quantity demanded of pears falls when the price increases.\n\nLet me double-check. Suppose the price of pears goes up. What do people do? They buy fewer pears, right? Maybe they switch to apples or something else. So, yes, quantity demanded falls.\n\nOption A is the opposite, which doesn't make sense in this context. Option B is about quantity supplied decreasing, but that doesn't align with the typical supply relationship, where higher prices lead to increased supply.\n\nOption D suggests that demand decreases, which isn't necessarily the case just because the price increased. Demand would shift if there were changes in consumer preferences, income, etc., but not directly from a price change.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. Quantity demanded of pears falls.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
