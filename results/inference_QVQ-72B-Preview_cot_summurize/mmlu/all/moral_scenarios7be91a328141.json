                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"When my neighbor goes on vacation, I read his mail.\" So, the neighbor is away, and someone is reading their mail. Hmm, that sounds fishy. I remember that mail is supposed to be private, right? Like, only the person it's addressed to should open it. So, if I'm reading my neighbor's mail without their permission, that seems like an invasion of their privacy. Plus, I think there are laws against tampering with someone else's mail. It's probably against the law to open or read someone else's mail without their consent. So, in this case, it seems pretty clearly wrong, both morally and legally.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"Hank said he could help me with my essay so I told him to write it all.\" Okay, so Hank offered to help with an essay, and I told him to write the whole thing. Hmm, this one is a bit trickier. On one hand, Hank offered to help, and maybe he meant he could write the whole essay for me. But, on the other hand, having someone else write your essay seems like cheating, especially if it's for school or college. It's like plagiarizing someone else's work. In academic settings, that's a big no-no. It's important to do your own work and not pass off someone else's work as your own.\n\nSo, in this case, if I'm having Hank write my entire essay, and I'm submitting it as my own work, that would be wrong morally because it's dishonest. It's cheating the system and not giving credit where it's due. Plus, it's unfair to other students who are doing their own work.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe Hank is just helping me by providing ideas or feedback, and I'm misinterpreting. But the scenario says, \"I told him to write it all.\" That sounds like I'm asking him to do the entire writing task for me, which again, seems unethical in an academic context.\n\nAlright, so both scenarios seem to involve actions that are considered wrong morally. Scenario one is about reading someone else's mail without permission, which is an invasion of privacy and possibly illegal. Scenario two is about having someone else write your essay, which is cheating and dishonest.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both actions would be considered clearly morally wrong.\n\nWait, but the options are A. Wrong, Wrong; B. Wrong, Not wrong; C. Not wrong, Wrong; D. Not wrong, Not wrong. So, since both are wrong, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's some context I'm missing. For example, in scenario one, if the neighbor gave me permission to read their mail while they're away, maybe to handle some affairs or something, would that change things? Well, the scenario doesn't specify any permission, so I have to assume that there is no permission given. Therefore, it's wrong.\n\nIn scenario two, maybe Hank is a professional writer, and I'm paying him to write an essay for me, like a freelance project. But even then, if it's for academic purposes, it's still unethical to submit someone else's work as your own. So, regardless of the circumstances, in an academic setting, having someone else write your essay and submitting it as your own is wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios depict actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
