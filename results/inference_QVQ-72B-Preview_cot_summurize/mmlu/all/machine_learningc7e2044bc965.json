                    "text": "So I've got these two statements here, and I need to figure out which ones are true or false. Let's tackle them one at a time.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: \"Linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators.\"\n\nHmm, I remember learning about linear regression in my stats class. It's a method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The estimator here refers to the way we estimate the parameters of the regression line, like the slope and intercept.\n\nThe statement says that this estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators. Unbiased means that the expected value of the estimator is equal to the true parameter value. So, if I'm estimating the slope, the expected value of my estimator should be the true slope.\n\nBut does linear regression have the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators? I think this might be related to the Gauss-Markov theorem. Let me recall: the Gauss-Markov theorem states that in a linear regression model, if the errors have zero mean, constant variance, and are uncorrelated, then the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator is the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE). That means it has the smallest variance among all linear unbiased estimators.\n\nWait a minute, is it among all estimators or just linear ones? I think it's among linear unbiased estimators. So, there might be nonlinear estimators that are unbiased but have smaller variances, but the theorem doesn't cover those.\n\nLet me check online or in my textbook to confirm. Oh, I don't have my textbook right now, but I can try to recall.\n\nYes, the Gauss-Markov theorem guarantees that the OLS estimator is the best linear unbiased estimator in the class of linear estimators. So, it has the smallest variance among all linear unbiased estimators.\n\nBut if we consider nonlinear estimators, there might be some that are unbiased and have smaller variances. For example, in certain situations, ridge regression or other regularized methods can have smaller variances, but they are biased.\n\nHowever, the statement says \"among all unbiased estimators,\" not just linear ones. So, if we consider all unbiased estimators, not just linear ones, then the OLS estimator might not necessarily have the smallest variance.\n\nI think the statement is a bit misleading because it doesn't specify the class of estimators. If it's among all linear unbiased estimators, then yes, OLS has the smallest variance, thanks to the Gauss-Markov theorem. But among all unbiased estimators, there might be nonlinear ones that are unbiased and have smaller variances.\n\nMaybe I should look for an example. Suppose I have a simple linear regression model with one predictor. The OLS estimator for the slope is unbiased, and according to Gauss-Markov, it has the smallest variance among linear unbiased estimators.\n\nBut if I consider a nonlinear estimator, like the median of the slopes from bootstrap samples, that might also be unbiased under certain conditions and could potentially have a smaller variance.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure about that. Maybe in some cases, nonlinear estimators can have smaller variances, but I don't have a specific example in mind.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some scenarios, maximum likelihood estimators can be unbiased and have smaller variances than OLS.\n\nWait, in the case of normal errors, the OLS estimator is also the maximum likelihood estimator, and it's still unbiased with the smallest variance among linear estimators.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should stick with what I initially thought: the Gauss-Markov theorem applies only to linear unbiased estimators, so among all unbiased estimators, there might be nonlinear ones with smaller variances.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is false because it claims that linear regression has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators, without specifying the class of estimators.\n\nNow, moving on to Statement 2: \"The coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.\"\n\nAdaBoost, or Adaptive Boosting, is a machine learning algorithm that combines multiple weak classifiers into a strong one. It gives higher weights to misclassified instances and lower weights to correctly classified ones, effectively focusing on difficult cases.\n\nIn AdaBoost, each weak classifier is assigned a coefficient \u03b1, which determines its contribution to the final strong classifier.\n\nI recall that \u03b1 is calculated based on the error rate of each weak classifier. Specifically, \u03b1_t = (1/2) * ln((1 - \u03b5_t)/\u03b5_t), where \u03b5_t is the weighted error rate of the t-th weak classifier.\n\nGiven this formula, \u03b1_t is positive if \u03b5_t < 0.5, because (1 - \u03b5_t)/\u03b5_t > 1, and the natural logarithm of a number greater than 1 is positive.\n\nIf \u03b5_t >= 0.5, then \u03b1_t would be negative or undefined (if \u03b5_t = 0.5, ln(0/0.5) is undefined, but in practice, \u03b5_t should be less than 0.5 for the weak learner to be better than random guessing).\n\nHowever, in the standard AdaBoost algorithm, weak classifiers with \u03b5_t >= 0.5 are not typically used because they perform no better than random guessing or worse.\n\nTherefore, in practice, \u03b1 should always be non-negative because we discard weak classifiers that have \u03b5_t >= 0.5.\n\nBut is it possible to have a scenario where \u03b5_t >= 0.5 and \u03b1 is negative?\n\nWell, if \u03b5_t > 0.5, \u03b1 would be negative. But in AdaBoost, such weak classifiers are usually not used, as their performance is worse than random guessing.\n\nIf \u03b5_t = 0.5, \u03b1 is undefined, but in practice, we wouldn't use such a classifier.\n\nSo, in theory, if we allow weak classifiers with \u03b5_t >= 0.5, \u03b1 could be negative or undefined.\n\nBut in standard AdaBoost implementation, we typically discard weak classifiers that perform worse than or equal to random guessing.\n\nTherefore, in practice, \u03b1 is always non-negative.\n\nHence, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nStatement 1: False, because the Gauss-Markov theorem applies only to linear unbiased estimators, and there might be nonlinear unbiased estimators with smaller variances.\n\nStatement 2: True, because in AdaBoost, \u03b1 is always non-negative when considering weak classifiers that perform better than random guessing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
