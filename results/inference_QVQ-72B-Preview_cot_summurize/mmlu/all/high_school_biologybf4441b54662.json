Polygenic traits\n\nD. Blended alleles\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with option A: heterozygous traits. I remember that heterozygous refers to having two different alleles for a particular gene. So, if you have one allele for blue eyes and one for brown eyes, you're heterozygous for that trait. But does this involve more than one gene? Hmm, not really. It's about the combination of alleles within a single gene. So, probably not.\n\nOption B: pleiotropic traits. Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. For example, a gene might influence both height and hair texture. So, in this case, it's one gene affecting multiple traits, not multiple genes affecting a single trait. So, maybe not what we're looking for here.\n\nOption C: polygenic traits. This sounds familiar. I think polygenic traits are influenced by multiple genes. Yeah, that makes sense. For example, skin color is a polygenic trait because it's determined by several different genes working together. So, this seems like a good candidate.\n\nOption D: blended alleles. I'm not as familiar with this term. I know that in incomplete dominance, traits can blend, like in some flower colors. But again, this seems to involve a single gene with multiple alleles, not multiple genes contributing to the trait.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option C, polygenic traits, is the one where a trait is affected by more than one gene.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any chance that pleiotropic traits could be considered as affected by more than one gene? No, pleiotropy is about one gene affecting multiple traits, not multiple genes affecting one trait.\n\nAnd heterozygous traits are just about having two different alleles for a single gene, so that doesn't involve multiple genes.\n\nBlended alleles also seem to relate to a single gene with multiple possible expressions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Polygenic traits.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider an example. Take height in humans. It's a polygenic trait, meaning multiple genes contribute to determining a person's height. On the other hand, eye color can sometimes be influenced by more than one gene, but I think it's primarily determined by a few genes, not just one.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that polygenic traits are the ones affected by more than one gene.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
