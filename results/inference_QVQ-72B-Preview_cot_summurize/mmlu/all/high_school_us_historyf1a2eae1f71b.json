                    "text": "So I have this question here about Manifest Destiny and which president is most closely associated with it. The options are James K. Polk, Andrew Johnson, Woodrow Wilson, and Ronald Reagan. Hmm, I need to recall what Manifest Destiny was all about and then see which of these presidents was most involved with that idea.\n\nFirst off, Manifest Destiny was this belief in the 19th century that it was the United States' divine right and destiny to expand across the North American continent. Like, from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. It was a big driver behind American territorial expansion, especially in the mid-1800s.\n\nSo, let's think about each president one by one.\n\nStarting with James K. Polk. I remember he was the 11th president, serving from 1845 to 1849. He was pretty active in expanding the nation's territory. For instance, during his presidency, the United States acquired California and New Mexico through the Mexican-American War, and Oregon was settled by agreement with Britain. That's a significant amount of land added to the country. Seems like he was really into the whole Manifest Destiny thing.\n\nNext, Andrew Johnson. He was the 17th president, serving after Abraham Lincoln's assassination, from 1865 to 1869. His time was mostly focused on Reconstruction after the Civil War. I don't recall any major territorial expansions during his presidency. Maybe some minor adjustments, but nothing on the scale of what Polk did. So, probably not as closely associated with Manifest Destiny.\n\nThen there's Woodrow Wilson, the 28th president, in office from 1913 to 1921. His presidency was dominated by World War I and his efforts to establish the League of Nations. While he did oversee some territorial acquisitions like the Virgin Islands, it's not really in the same vein as Manifest Destiny, which was more about expanding across North America. So, again, not as directly linked to the concept.\n\nLastly, Ronald Reagan, the 40th president, serving from 1981 to 1989. His presidency was marked by the Cold War, the Iran-Contra affair, and a focus on domestic policies like supply-side economics. He didn't have any significant territorial expansions or manifest destiny-like activities during his time in office. So, probably not the answer.\n\nLooking back, James K. Polk seems to be the president who was most actively involved with Manifest Destiny. His presidency saw substantial territorial growth, which aligns perfectly with the idea of Manifest Destiny.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any chance that Andrew Johnson was involved in some Manifest Destiny-related events that I might have forgotten? Let me think... No, I don't think so. His main focus was on rebuilding the nation after the Civil War, not on expanding its borders.\n\nWhat about Woodrow Wilson? He was more into international diplomacy and trying to prevent future wars. Manifest Destiny was more about American expansionism in the 19th century, which wasn't really his focus.\n\nAnd Reagan, well, he was more about reasserting American strength in the context of the Cold War, but not in terms of territorial expansion.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty confident that James K. Polk is the correct answer here. He was deeply involved in advancing the United States' borders and embodying the spirit of Manifest Destiny.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider the quote provided. It's from John L. O'Sullivan in 1839, talking about the future greatness of America and its divine mission to spread democratic principles. Polk was president in the 1840s, which aligns with the timeframe when Manifest Destiny was a prominent idea.\n\nNone of the other presidents listed were in office during the height of the Manifest Destiny movement. Polk was right in the thick of it.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be A. James K. Polk.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ James K. Polk}} \\]"
