They contain the primary visual cortex, which is essential for interpreting and understanding visual stimuli from the eyes.\n\nWhen the occipital lobes are damaged, it can lead to various visual impairments, including partial or complete loss of vision, difficulty recognizing objects, and problems with spatial awareness.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. sight.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
