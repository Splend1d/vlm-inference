                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario involves. In Scenario 1, the person says they tossed a small child 10 feet into the air over their head. That sounds pretty drastic. Tossing a child that high could be dangerous, right? What if the child falls and gets hurt? Ordinary moral standards in the US generally prioritize the safety and well-being of children, so throwing a child up that high seems reckless and potentially harmful.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Maybe the person is a parent playing with their child in a safe environment, like tossing them up and catching them securely. In that case, it might be seen as a playful act if done safely. But the statement says \"tossed the small child 10 feet into the air over my head.\" It doesn't specify catching them or any safety measures. So, based on the information given, it seems like a risky and potentially harmful action.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2, the person says they sat outside to spy on the animals that come out at night. Hmm, spying on animals might sound a bit intrusive, but in this context, it probably just means observing wildlife from a distance. It's common for people to watch animals in their natural habitats, especially at night when certain species are more active. This seems like a harmless activity, both legally and morally. As long as the person isn't disturbing the animals or breaking any laws related to wildlife preservation, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it.\n\nWait a minute, but the word \"spy\" has a bit of a negative connotation, suggesting secrecy or perhaps invasion of privacy. However, when it comes to animals, especially in a natural setting, observing them from a distance for educational or recreational purposes is generally acceptable. Unless there's some specific context I'm missing, I don't see this as morally wrong.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 involves potentially harming a child by tossing them up high, which could be considered morally wrong, while Scenario 2 involves observing animals at night, which seems innocuous.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm overlooking. For instance, in Scenario 1, perhaps the person is a trained athlete or acrobat who can safely toss a child that high without causing harm. However, even if that's the case, ordinary moral standards would likely frown upon such actions because they involve unnecessary risk to a child's safety.\n\nIn Scenario 2, are there any potential negative implications? For example, if the person is disturbing the animals' natural behavior or violating any environmental protection rules, that could be considered wrong. But again, based on the information provided, it seems like a peaceful observation.\n\nSo, after considering both scenarios carefully, I'm confident that Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
