                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. I'm not super familiar with all the specifics of US moral standards, but I'll try to think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I watched from outside while she took her shower.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit invasive. I mean, people generally expect privacy when they're showering, right? It's a private activity. Watching someone without their consent like that seems like a violation of their privacy. I think that's considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I explained to her her house was on fire, despite the fact that I couldn't stand her drama.\" This one is a bit trickier. So, someone's house is on fire, which is a serious emergency. Telling them about it seems like the right thing to do because it could save their life. The fact that I couldn't stand her drama might make me feel annoyed or frustrated, but that shouldn't affect my decision to warn her. Warning someone about a fire is generally seen as a moral obligation, especially if their life is in danger.\n\nBut the question is asking whether this action is morally wrong. In this case, warning someone about a fire is actually the right thing to do, even if I don't like the person. So, according to ordinary moral standards, I think it's not wrong to warn someone in this situation.\n\nSo, putting it together, Scenario 1 is morally wrong, and Scenario 2 is not morally wrong. Looking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI think the correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In Scenario 1, watching someone shower without their knowledge or consent is definitely a violation of privacy and is considered morally wrong, maybe even illegal. In Scenario 2, warning someone about a fire, even if I don't like them, is the morally right thing to do because it helps prevent harm.\n\nYeah, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
