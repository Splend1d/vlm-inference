The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state).\"\nElection of 1864, Harpweek.com\nWhich of the following provides the best explanation for why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the Radical Republicans opposing Lincoln in 1861. First off, I need to understand who the Radical Republicans were and what their main concerns or disagreements with Lincoln were at that time.\n\nSo, Radical Republicans were a group within the Republican Party during the Civil War era who advocated for stronger measures against the Confederacy and more aggressive policies to end slavery and ensure civil rights for freed slaves. They were known for pushing Lincoln to take a harder line on these issues.\n\nNow, the question is asking why they opposed Lincoln in 1861. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation was done without congressional oversight.\n\nWait a minute, the Emancipation Proclamation wasn't issued until 1863, during the Civil War. So, in 1861, Lincoln hadn't yet issued the proclamation. Maybe this option is a bit misleading because the timing doesn't align. Perhaps there's a mistake here, or maybe it's intended to test whether I know that the proclamation came later.\n\nB. The Radical Republicans wanted immediate emancipation of slaves, but Lincoln refused to cooperate.\n\nIn 1861, Lincoln was still trying to preserve the Union and was cautious about the issue of slavery. He didn't immediately embrace abolitionist causes, fearing it might push border states to secede. The Radicals, on the other hand, were pushing for immediate and total abolition. So, there was definitely a disagreement here.\n\nC. Lincoln's Ten Percent Plan provided no assurance of black suffrage.\n\nThe Ten Percent Plan was Lincoln's proposal for Reconstruction, which he announced in 1863. It allowed southern states to form new governments once 10% of their voters took an oath of allegiance to the Union. However, this plan didn't address the issue of black suffrage, which was a major concern for the Radical Republicans. They wanted to ensure that freed slaves had the right to vote.\n\nD. Lincoln's appointment of Andrew Johnson as vice president clashed with the Reconstruction goals of the Senate.\n\nAndrew Johnson was appointed as vice president in 1864, when Lincoln ran for re-election. Johnson was a Southern Democrat who had remained loyal to the Union during the war. His appointment was part of Lincoln's strategy to reach out to Unionists in the South. However, Johnson's views on Reconstruction were more lenient than those of the Radical Republicans, who favored a harsher approach towards the South.\n\nGiven that the question specifies \"in 1861,\" I need to consider which of these options is relevant to that time period.\n\nOption A mentions the Emancipation Proclamation, which was in 1863, so that's after 1861.\n\nOption B talks about immediate emancipation, which was a point of contention in 1861. Lincoln was not yet fully committed to abolition at that stage, focusing instead on preserving the Union.\n\nOption C refers to the Ten Percent Plan, which was announced in 1863, again after 1861.\n\nOption D mentions Lincoln's appointment of Andrew Johnson as vice president, which happened in 1864, again, after 1861.\n\nSo, based on the timing, options A, C, and D are not applicable to 1861.\n\nThat leaves option B, which discusses the disagreement over immediate emancipation of slaves in 1861. Lincoln was indeed reluctant to embrace immediate and total abolition at that early stage of the war, while the Radical Republicans were pressing for it.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be the best explanation for why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Was the Ten Percent Plan announced in 1863, as I thought? Yes, according to my knowledge. And the Emancipation Proclamation was indeed in 1863, and Johnson was appointed in 1864. So, in 1861, the main point of contention would have been Lincoln's approach to slavery and emancipation, which aligns with option B.\n\nAdditionally, in 1861, Lincoln was still hoping to prevent the secession of border states like Maryland, Missouri, and Kentucky, which had slavery but hadn't joined the Confederacy. He was cautious about taking steps that might push them into secession. This caution led to tensions with the Radical Republicans, who were less concerned about losing these states and more focused on ending slavery everywhere.\n\nSo, yeah, I think option B is the correct answer. The Radical Republicans wanted immediate emancipation of slaves, but Lincoln refused to cooperate in 1861.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
