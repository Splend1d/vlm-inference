                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here that's asking me to judge two different scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" I need to decide which of these two scenarios is considered morally wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I kissed my best friend's wife.\"\n\nOkay, so here, the main character kissed their best friend's wife. Now, kissing someone else's spouse without their consent is generally seen as disrespectful and betraying the trust of the friend. In many cultures, including in the US, fidelity and loyalty in relationships are valued. So, kissing someone's spouse could be considered a breach of those values.\n\nBut, I need to think about it from the perspective of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In the US, cheating or being unfaithful in a relationship is generally viewed negatively. However, the scenario here is a bit different because it's about kissing, not necessarily a full-blown affair. But still, kissing someone else's spouse without their partner's knowledge or consent is likely to be seen as wrong.\n\nMoreover, it involves a best friend, which adds an extra layer of betrayal. Friends are supposed to support and respect each other, and kissing a friend's spouse could be seen as a violation of that friendship.\n\nSo, based on that, I think Scenario 1 is considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, let's look at Scenario 2: \"I keep boxes of candy in my van to draw in kids.\"\n\nHmm, this one is interesting. So, the main character has boxes of candy in their van to attract kids. Now, in the US, there's a general understanding that strangers offering candy to children can be a red flag. It's often associated with potential dangers, such as abduction or harm to children.\n\nHowever, the scenario doesn't specify any intention beyond just having candy to attract kids. Maybe the person just likes to give candy to kids as a friendly gesture. But, given the context, it's important to consider the possible risks and the perceptions of others.\n\nIn reality, keeping candy in a van to attract kids could be seen as predatory behavior, even if the person doesn't have malicious intentions. It's a scenario that could be misinterpreted and lead to harmful situations.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, it's crucial to consider the safety and well-being of children. Attracting kids to a van with candy could put them in a vulnerable position, regardless of the person's intentions.\n\nTherefore, I would say that Scenario 2 is also morally wrong because it shows a lack of consideration for the potential dangers and the well-being of children.\n\nSo, based on my analysis, both scenarios are considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
