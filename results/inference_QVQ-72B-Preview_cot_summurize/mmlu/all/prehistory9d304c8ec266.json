                    "text": "So I'm trying to answer this question about the ancient city of Cahokia. It asks how many earthen mounds it contained and what its population was around. The options are:\n\nA. 120 earthen mounds; 10,000 people\n\nB. 60 burial mounds; 2,000 people\n\nC. 50 religious monuments; 5,000 people\n\nD. 200 pyramidal mounds; 200,000 people\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Cahokia is known for. I remember that Cahokia was a pre-Columbian city located near modern-day St. Louis, Missouri. It's famous for its large earthen mounds, which were built by the Mississippian culture.\n\nI think the largest mound in Cahokia is Monks Mound, which is pretty big, like a pyramid made of earth. So, it's known for having multiple mounds, but I'm not sure about the exact number.\n\nLet me consider the options one by one.\n\nOption A says 120 earthen mounds and a population of 10,000. That seems plausible. I've heard that Cahokia had hundreds of mounds, but maybe not all of them were earthen mounds. Some might have been made of other materials or served different purposes.\n\nOption B mentions 60 burial mounds and a population of 2,000. I know that Cahokia had burial mounds, but I think their mounds served various purposes, not just burial. So, maybe 60 is too low for the total number of mounds.\n\nOption C lists 50 religious monuments and a population of 5,000. Again, I think Cahokia had more mounds than just 50, and they weren't all strictly religious monuments. Some were likely used for ceremonial purposes, while others might have had different functions.\n\nOption D suggests 200 pyramidal mounds and a population of 200,000. This seems quite high. I know Cahokia was a large city for its time, but 200,000 people seem excessive for an ancient city. As for the number of mounds, I've read that there were hundreds, but I'm not sure if 200 is accurate.\n\nI need to find reliable information about the number of mounds in Cahokia and its estimated population.\n\nLet me think about what I know. Cahokia was a major center of the Mississippian culture, which flourished from around 1050 to 1400 CE. At its peak, it was one of the largest cities in the world during that time.\n\nRegarding the mounds, Cahokia is known for its complex of mounds, the largest being Monks Mound, which is a massive structure. In total, I believe there are over 100 mounds in the Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site.\n\nWait, let me verify that. I think the Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site preserves about 80 mounds, but originally, there were more\u2014maybe around 120 mounds in total.\n\nSo, option A mentions 120 earthen mounds, which aligns with this information.\n\nNow, for the population. Estimating the population of ancient cities is tricky because evidence can be incomplete. However, scholars have made educated guesses based on archaeological findings and the size of the city.\n\nI recall that Cahokia was a significant urban center, possibly the largest city in what is now the United States before European contact. At its height, it might have had several thousand to tens of thousands of inhabitants.\n\nOption A suggests a population of 10,000, which seems reasonable. Option D proposes 200,000, which feels too high for an ancient city in that region.\n\nLet me consider the population density. If Cahokia covered a certain area and had a population of 10,000, that would be comparable to other ancient cities of similar size, like Teotihuacan in Mexico or the Mayan city of Tikal.\n\nOption C offers 5,000 people, which might be on the low side for Cahokia's peak population. Option B has 2,000, which also seems too small.\n\nTherefore, based on my knowledge, option A (120 earthen mounds and a population of 10,000) seems the most plausible.\n\nBut I should double-check this information to be sure.\n\nLet me think about textbooks or reliable sources that might provide this information. I recall that James A. Brown's \"Cahokia: America's First City\" provides detailed information about the site, including population estimates and the number of mounds.\n\nAlternatively, the Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site's official website might have accurate data.\n\nIf I were to look it up, I'd search for \"Cahokia mounds number\" and \"Cahokia population estimate.\"\n\nAssuming I can't access external resources right now, I'll rely on my memory and the process of elimination.\n\nFirst, confirming the number of mounds. I think 120 is a reasonable number for the total mounds in Cahokia, considering the state historic site has about 80 mounds, and originally there were more.\n\nSecond, the population was likely around 10,000 people at its peak, which makes sense given the city's size and the resources available at the time.\n\nTherefore, I would go with option A: 120 earthen mounds and a population of around 10,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
