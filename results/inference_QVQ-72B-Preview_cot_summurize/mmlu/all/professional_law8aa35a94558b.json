                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a city imposing taxes on commercial artists and itinerant figure drawers. There's a gallery from a neighboring state that sends artists into this city to draw pictures and collect payments, then have the paintings framed and mailed back to customers. The gallery is challenging the constitutionality of a $100 per year excise tax imposed on these itinerant artists. I need to figure out which option the court will most likely choose.\n\nFirst, let's understand the taxes involved. The city imposes a $200 per year excise tax on commercial artists' studios within the city and a $100 per year excise tax on itinerant commercial figure drawers for using the streets and sidewalks. There's also a credit against this $100 tax if the drawer or their employer has paid the studio tax.\n\nThe gallery from a neighboring state sends two artists into the city to draw pictures, collect $2.00 payments, and then have the drawings framed and mailed to the customers from a studio, presumably in the neighboring state since it's mentioned that the neighboring state doesn't tax artists' studios.\n\nNow, the gallery is challenging the $100 per year excise tax imposed on these itinerant artists in the city. I need to determine which of the provided options the court is most likely to choose.\n\nOption A says the tax is constitutional as a valid ad valorem tax on interstate commerce. Ad valorem taxes are typically based on the value of something, like property taxes on homes or cars. In this case, the tax isn't based on the value of the drawings or the business done; it's a flat $100 per year excise tax per itinerant artist. So, it doesn't seem like an ad valorem tax. Maybe this option isn't correct.\n\nOption B says the tax is constitutional because it's levied not on the commercial art business as a whole but on the local activity of drawing pictures. This seems plausible. The tax is specifically on the privilege of using the streets and sidewalks to draw pictures and collect payments. It's targeting the local activity, not the entire business operation that spans multiple states. So, perhaps the court would find this tax acceptable because it's regulating and taxing the local aspect of the business.\n\nOption C says the tax is unconstitutional because a state or municipality may not impose a license tax on orders for goods or services to be performed in another state. In this scenario, the drawings are completed and framed in another state, and the studio is in another state where no studio tax is imposed. However, the itinerant artists are performing services within the city\u2014drawing pictures and collecting payments. So, is the tax on the orders or on the local activity? It seems like the tax is on the privilege of using the city's streets and sidewalks for this activity, not directly on the orders placed for goods or services in another state. So, maybe this isn't the best reason to declare the tax unconstitutional.\n\nOption D says the tax is unconstitutional as a discriminatory privilege tax. To determine if it's discriminatory, I need to see if it treats similar entities differently. The city is taxing itinerant commercial figure drawers $100 per year, and there's a credit if they have a studio in the city and pay the $200 studio tax. But the gallery is from another state and doesn't have a studio in the city, so they don't get the credit. Is this discriminatory? Well, the tax is applied equally to all itinerant commercial figure drawers, regardless of where their studio is located. However, if a drawer has a studio in the city and pays the $200 tax, they get a credit against the $100 tax. So, in effect, drawers with studios in the city pay $100 (studio tax) plus $0 (excise tax minus credit), totaling $100, while drawers without studios in the city pay $0 (no studio tax) plus $100 (excise tax), totaling $100. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If a drawer has a studio in the city, they pay $200 for the studio tax and get a credit against the $100 excise tax, so they pay $200 - $100 = $100. Drawers without studios in the city pay $100 excise tax. So, both pay $100, but drawers with studios in the city pay through the studio tax while drawers without studios pay directly the excise tax. So, it's not discriminatory in that sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gallery is arguing that since the studio is in another state, and that state doesn't tax studios, they shouldn't be taxed by this city. But that doesn't seem directly relevant here, as the tax is on the local activity in the city.\n\nGiven this analysis, I think Option B is the most likely choice. The tax is on the local activity of drawing pictures and collecting payments on the city's streets and sidewalks, which is a legitimate area for the city to regulate and tax. It's not an ad valorem tax, so Option A is incorrect. Option C doesn't seem to apply because the tax is on the local activity, not directly on orders placed for goods or services in another state. Option D doesn't seem to hold water because the tax appears to be applied equally to all itinerant commercial figure drawers, regardless of where their studio is located.\n\nTherefore, the court will most likely declare the tax constitutional, as a valid tax on local activity, which is Option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
