                    "text": "So I've got this question about a merchant's irrevocable written offer, also known as a firm offer, to sell goods. The options are:\n\nA. Must be separately signed if the offeree supplies a form contract containing the offer.\n\nB. Is valid for three months.\n\nC. Is nonassignable.\n\nD. Can not exceed a three-month duration even if consideration is given.\n\nI need to figure out which of these statements is correct. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a firm offer is. In contract law, especially in the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which deals with sales of goods, a firm offer is a promise by a merchant to keep an offer open for a certain period without revocation. This is important because typically, an offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance, unless there's a consideration to keep it open or it's a firm offer under the UCC.\n\nSo, under the UCC, a merchant can make a firm offer that is irrevocable for a stated period, even without consideration, provided certain conditions are met.\n\nLet's look at option A: Must be separately signed if the offeree supplies a form contract containing the offer.\n\nHmm, I'm not entirely sure about this one. If the offeree supplies a form contract, does the merchant's firm offer need to be separately signed? I think that in general, for a firm offer to be enforceable, it needs to be in writing and signed by the merchant. But does it have to be separately signed if it's part of a form contract supplied by the offeree? I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I need to look this up.\n\nMoving on to option B: Is valid for three months.\n\nI recall that under the UCC, a firm offer by a merchant can be irrevocable for a period of time, but there's a limit to how long that period can be. I think the maximum is three months unless consideration is given for a longer period. So, is this statement always true? Not necessarily, because if consideration is given, the offer can be irrevocable for a longer period. So, this seems a bit too absolute. Maybe not entirely accurate.\n\nOption C: Is nonassignable.\n\nThis one is interesting. Assignability of contracts is generally possible unless there's a specific prohibition or the nature of the contract makes it unassignable. For a firm offer, which is essentially a promise not to revoke an offer, I wonder if it can be assigned. I'm not sure about this. Maybe I need to think about whether the rights under a firm offer can be transferred to another party. I don't recall any specific rule about this, so perhaps it's generally assignable unless there's something in the offer that prevents it. So, saying it's nonassignable might not be accurate.\n\nOption D: Can not exceed a three-month duration even if consideration is given.\n\nThis seems similar to option B. The UCC allows firm offers by merchants to be irrevocable for a stated period, but there's a limit. Without consideration, the maximum period is three months. However, if consideration is given to keep the offer open for a longer period, then it can be irrevocable for that longer period. So, saying that it cannot exceed three months even if consideration is given is incorrect because consideration can extend the irrevocability period beyond three months.\n\nAlright, so based on this, it seems that none of the options are entirely accurate as stated. Or maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check.\n\nOption A: Must be separately signed if the offeree supplies a form contract containing the offer.\n\nI think that as long as the offer is in writing and signed by the merchant, it's enforceable as a firm offer. Whether the offeree supplies the form or not might not matter, as long as the merchant's offer is clearly stated and signed. So, maybe this option is not correct.\n\nOption B: Is valid for three months.\n\nThis is too absolute. While three months is the standard period for firm offers without consideration, with consideration, the period can be longer. So, this isn't always true.\n\nOption C: Is nonassignable.\n\nI don't think that's necessarily the case. Assignability depends on the terms of the offer and general contract principles. So, generally, firm offers are assignable unless there's a restriction.\n\nOption D: Can not exceed a three-month duration even if consideration is given.\n\nThis is clearly incorrect because consideration can extend the irrevocability period beyond three months.\n\nSo, none of the options seem to be correctly stating the law regarding firm offers. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the question is trying to say that among these options, which one could be correct under certain circumstances.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing knowledge of the UCC Section 2-205, which deals with firm offers. Let me recall: \"A firm offer is irrevocable as long as it states that it is irrevocable and is in writing and signed by the merchant offeror. It must specify a definite time, not to exceed three months, during which it is to hold the offer open.\"\n\nWait, but that's for offers without consideration. If consideration is given, the offer can be irrevocable for a longer period.\n\nGiven that, option A seems to be referring to the form of the contract. Maybe if the offeree supplies a form contract, the merchant's offer needs to be separately signed to be distinguished from the offeree's terms. But I'm still not sure.\n\nOption B suggests it's valid for three months, which is only true without consideration. With consideration, it can be longer.\n\nOption C says it's nonassignable, which I don't think is generally the case.\n\nOption D again states it cannot exceed three months even with consideration, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is none of the above. But maybe the question expects one of these to be correct under certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to test the understanding that a firm offer must be in writing and signed by the merchant, and that it can be irrevocable for up to three months without consideration, and longer with consideration.\n\nGiven that, option A seems to be referring to a situation where the offeree supplies a form contract, and the merchant's offer is included therein. Whether it needs to be separately signed might depend on the clarity of the offer within the form contract. Maybe to ensure enforceability, it should be separately signed to avoid confusion with the offeree's terms.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely confident about this.\n\nOption B is too restrictive because with consideration, the offer can be irrevocable for longer than three months.\n\nOption C is probably incorrect because firm offers are generally assignable unless there's a specific prohibition.\n\nOption D is definitely incorrect because consideration can extend the irrevocability period beyond three months.\n\nSo, if I had to choose one, I might go with option A, but with some hesitation. Maybe the idea is that if the offeree supplies a form contract, the merchant's firm offer should be separately signed to clearly attribute it to the merchant and ensure it's enforceable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that none of the options are accurate, but since that's not an option, I need to pick one.\n\nI think I'll go with option A, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
