                    "text": "Oh, I have this problem here about direct proportionality. It says that x and y are directly proportional, and when y = 8, x = 3. I need to find the value of x when y = 13. The options are 0.615, 4.875, 15, and 34.667.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what direct proportionality means. If x and y are directly proportional, that means that as y increases, x increases by a constant factor. So, there's a constant k such that x = k * y.\n\nGiven that x = 3 when y = 8, I can use this to find the constant k.\n\nSo, plugging in the known values: 3 = k * 8.\n\nTo solve for k, I divide both sides by 8: k = 3/8 = 0.375.\n\nNow that I have k, I can find x when y = 13 by plugging back into the equation: x = 0.375 * 13.\n\nLet me calculate that: 0.375 * 13.\n\nFirst, 0.375 * 10 = 3.75.\n\nThen, 0.375 * 3 = 1.125.\n\nAdding those together: 3.75 + 1.125 = 4.875.\n\nSo, x = 4.875 when y = 13.\n\nLooking back at the options, that's choice B. 4.875.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, since x and y are directly proportional, their ratio x/y should be constant.\n\nSo, x/y = k = 3/8 = 0.375, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nThen, for y = 13, x = k * y = 0.375 * 13 = 4.875.\n\nYeah, that seems consistent.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors there.\n\nWait, but let's see if maybe I can cross-verify using cross-multiplication.\n\nIf x and y are directly proportional, then x/y = constant.\n\nSo, x1/y1 = x2/y2.\n\nGiven x1 = 3, y1 = 8, and y2 = 13, solve for x2.\n\nSo, 3/8 = x2/13.\n\nCross-multiplying: 3 * 13 = 8 * x2.\n\nSo, 39 = 8x2.\n\nThen, x2 = 39/8 = 4.875.\n\nYes, that confirms it again.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\nOption B. 4.875\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 4.875} \\]"
