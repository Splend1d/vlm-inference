A. brain injury, B. serial position effect, C. leading questions, D. proactive interference.\" Hmm, I need to think about this. Constructed memory sounds like when our memories aren't entirely accurate and are somehow influenced or altered by external factors. So, I need to figure out which of these options is most likely to cause that.\n\nFirst, let's consider brain injury (Option A). I know that brain injuries can affect memory because the brain is where memories are stored and processed. If someone has a brain injury, it might damage parts of the brain that handle memory, like the hippocampus or the frontal lobe. This could lead to problems with recalling memories or forming new ones. But does it construct false memories? Maybe in some cases, but I think it's more about memory loss or difficulties in retrieval rather than constructing something that didn't happen.\n\nNext, the serial position effect (Option B). I remember learning about this in psychology class. It's when people tend to remember items at the beginning and the end of a list better than the items in the middle. So, if someone is trying to memorize a list of words, they'll probably recall the first few and the last few more easily. But does this effect construct false memories? I don't think so. It seems more about how well we remember certain items based on their position in a list, not about creating false memories.\n\nOption C is leading questions. This sounds promising. I've heard about how leading questions can influence people's memories, especially in eyewitness testimonies. If a person is asked a question that suggests a particular answer or provides information, it might make them recall events in a certain way that aligns with that information, even if it wasn't entirely accurate. This can lead to false memories where the person genuinely believes something happened a certain way because of the way they were questioned. That sounds a lot like constructing a memory based on external information rather than actual events.\n\nLastly, proactive interference (Option D). I think this is when previous learning interferes with the recall of newer information. For example, if you learn a new phone number, but you keep dialing an old one because the old number interferes with recalling the new one. This seems more about forgetting or confusion between similar pieces of information rather than constructing a false memory.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, leading questions seem to be the most directly related to constructing false memories. Brain injury affects memory, but it's not specifically about constructing false memories. The serial position effect is about recall patterns, not false memories. Proactive interference is about confusion between similar information. Leading questions, on the other hand, can actually plant suggestions or ideas in someone's mind that alter their memory of an event.\n\nI think the answer is C. leading questions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
