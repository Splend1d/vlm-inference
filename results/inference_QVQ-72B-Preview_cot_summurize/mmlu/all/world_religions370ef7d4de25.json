Ikebana. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is related to flower arranging in Japanese culture.\n\nFirst off, I know that Japan has a rich tradition in art and design, and flower arranging is definitely part of that heritage. I think the term for Japanese flower arranging is Ikebana, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me go through each option to eliminate the ones that don't fit.\n\nStarting with option A: Zazen. I recall that Zazen is a form of meditation in Zen Buddhism where you sit in a specific posture and focus on your breath. It's more about mental and spiritual practice rather than flower arranging. So, I don't think Zazen is the correct answer here.\n\nNext, option B: Tariki. I'm not as familiar with this term. Let me see... I think Tariki refers to the concept of \"other-powered\" or \"other-directed\" salvation in Buddhism, particularly in Mahayana traditions. It's about relying on the power of others, like buddhas or bodhisattvas, for enlightenment. Again, this seems to be a philosophical or religious concept and not related to flower arranging.\n\nOption C: Kami. In Japanese mythology and religion, Kami are divine spirits or deities that inhabit various natural phenomena, objects, or places. Shinto, the indigenous religion of Japan, revolves around the worship of Kami. While Kami can be associated with nature, including plants and flowers, the term itself doesn't specifically denote the art of flower arranging.\n\nThat brings me to option D: Ikebana. I have heard of Ikebana before. I think it's the Japanese art of flower arrangement. Let me verify this. Ikebana involves arranging flowers in a way that emphasizes their natural beauty and harmony with their container and the surrounding space. It's considered a disciplined art form that has been practiced in Japan for centuries.\n\nYes, that sounds right. So, based on my knowledge, Ikebana is indeed the term for Japanese flower arranging. To make sure I'm not missing something, I'll double-check the other options once more.\n\nZazen is meditation, Tariki is a concept in Buddhism, Kami are divine spirits in Shinto, and Ikebana is flower arranging. So, clearly, Ikebana is the correct choice here.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there are any other Japanese terms that might refer to flower arranging. For example, Hanakago is sometimes used, but I think that's more specifically about flower baskets, not the general art of arranging flowers.\n\nAlso, Kado is another term sometimes used for the way of the flower, which is similar to Ikebana, but I believe Ikebana is the more commonly used term for flower arranging in Japan.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that D. Ikebana is the correct answer to the question \"Which of the following terms denote the Japanese art of flower arranging?\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Ikebana}} \\]"
