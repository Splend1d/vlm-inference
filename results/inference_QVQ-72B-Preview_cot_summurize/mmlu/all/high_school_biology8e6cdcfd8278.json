                    "text": "So I've got this question here: A couple has already had three sons, and the woman is pregnant with their fourth child. What's the probability that this fourth child will also be a boy? The options are 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, or 1/16.\n\nAlright, let's think about this step by step. First off, I know that each pregnancy is typically an independent event when it comes to the sex of the baby, assuming there are no genetic factors at play that would influence the sex. So, just because they've had three boys already, doesn't necessarily mean that the next one is any more or less likely to be a boy.\n\nI recall that the probability of having a boy or a girl is generally accepted to be roughly equal, right? So, in the general population, the chance of having a boy is about 1/2, or 50%.\n\nBut wait, maybe having already had three boys affects the probability somehow. Maybe it's like flipping a coin; each flip is independent, so no matter what came before, the next flip is still 50% heads and 50% tails. Similarly, each pregnancy is an independent event, so the sex of previous children shouldn't affect the sex of the next one.\n\nLet me consider if there's any bias here. For example, if a family has already had three boys, maybe there's something about their genetics that makes it more likely to have boys. But, unless there's a known genetic reason for having boys, I think we can assume that each pregnancy is independent and the probability remains 1/2.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to think about the conditional probability. The probability of the fourth child being a boy given that the first three are boys. In probability terms, that's P(boy|first three are boys). Since each pregnancy is independent, this should just be the probability of having a boy, which is 1/2.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about it in terms of a sequence. The sequence of children is like a sequence of independent events, each with a 1/2 chance of being a boy. So, the fact that the first three are boys doesn't influence the fourth child's sex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the question is trying to trick me into thinking that because they already have three boys, the next one is more likely to be a girl to balance things out. But no, that's a common misconception. Each pregnancy is independent, and the probability doesn't change based on previous outcomes.\n\nLet me consider the extreme case where they've had, say, 10 boys in a row. According to the same logic, the probability of the next child being a boy would still be 1/2, assuming each pregnancy is independent and there's no bias.\n\nI should also consider if there's any bias in reality. For example, in some populations, there might be a slight natural bias towards boys or girls, but generally, it's considered to be about 50-50.\n\nAnother angle: if the probability of having a boy was 1/2, then with each new pregnancy, the probability resets to 1/2, regardless of previous outcomes.\n\nMaybe I can think about it in terms of binomial probability. The probability of having k boys out of n pregnancies, where the probability of a boy is p=1/2. But the question isn't asking for the probability of having four boys; it's specifically asking for the probability that the fourth child is a boy, given that the first three are boys.\n\nYes, that's a conditional probability. So, P(fourth child is a boy | first three children are boys). As I thought earlier, since the pregnancies are independent, this should just be P(boy) = 1/2.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to calculate it using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem says that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). In this case, A is \"fourth child is a boy,\" and B is \"first three children are boys.\"\n\nBut actually, since the pregnancies are independent, P(B|A) is just P(B), which is P(three boys) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8. And P(A) is P(fourth child is a boy) = 1/2. P(B) is also 1/8. So, plugging into Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = (1/8 * 1/2) / (1/8) = (1/16)/(1/8) = 1/2.\n\nSo, it confirms that the probability is 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of sequences. The sequence of children is a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials, each with success probability p=1/2 for boys. Given that the first three are boys, the fourth is independent and thus has p=1/2.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The straightforward answer is that the probability is 1/2.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor that could influence this. Suppose, for example, that there's a genetic predisposition for boys in this family. But unless there's specific information about genetic conditions that affect the sex of the children, we generally assume that each pregnancy is independent with a 1/2 chance of a boy.\n\nAnother consideration: in reality, the ratio might not be exactly 1/2 due to various biological factors, but for the purposes of this problem, we can assume it's 1/2.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the probability that the fourth child is a boy, given that the first three are boys, is 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 1/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 1/2} \\]"
