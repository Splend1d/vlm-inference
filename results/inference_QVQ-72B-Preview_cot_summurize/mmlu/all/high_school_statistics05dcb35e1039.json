                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about the primary difference between an experiment and an observational study. There are four options, and I need to pick the one that's correct. Let me think about each one.\n\nOption A says that experiments are only conducted on human subjects, while observational studies can be conducted on nonhuman subjects. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. I know that experiments can be conducted on animals too, like in medical research. So, if experiments can be done on nonhumans, this option can't be the primary difference. Maybe it's not even a difference at all.\n\nOption B says that in an experiment, the researcher manipulates some variable to observe its effect on a response variable, whereas in an observational study, the researcher just observes and records the observations without manipulating anything. That sounds like a key difference. Experiments involve intervention by the researcher to change something and see what happens, while observational studies are more about watching and recording what happens naturally without interference.\n\nOption C says that experiments must use randomized treatment and control groups, but observational studies also use treatment and control groups, just not necessarily randomized. Wait a minute, in observational studies, do they even have treatment and control groups? I thought observational studies don't involve any manipulation, so there might not be a treatment per se. Maybe they look at existing groups or look for correlations. So, maybe this isn't the primary difference either.\n\nOption D says that experiments must be double-blind, whereas observational studies don't need to be. Double-blinding is when both the subjects and the researchers don't know who is in the treatment or control group. Not all experiments are double-blind, though. Some can be single-blind or open-label. Moreover, observational studies might not even have the concept of blinding because there's no manipulation. So, this seems like it might not be the primary difference either.\n\nLet me summarize what I think:\n\n- Option A: Incorrect because experiments can be done on nonhuman subjects.\n\n- Option B: Seems correct because it describes the main difference in how data is collected.\n\n- Option C: Incorrect because observational studies might not have treatment and control groups.\n\n- Option D: Incorrect because not all experiments are double-blind, and observational studies might not have blinding at all.\n\nTherefore, the primary difference between an experiment and an observational study is Option B: In an experiment, the researcher manipulates some variable to observe its effect on a response variable; in an observational study, he or she simply observes and records the observations.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. Experiments are designed to establish cause-and-effect relationships by manipulating variables, whereas observational studies are used to observe associations or correlations without manipulating variables. So, yes, that aligns with Option B.\n\nAlright, I'm confident that Option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
