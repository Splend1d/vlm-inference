                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about making a salad dressing. It says that the dressing is made by combining 2 parts vinegar with 5 parts oil. And the question is, how many ounces of oil should be mixed with 9 ounces of vinegar?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The recipe gives me a ratio of vinegar to oil, right? Specifically, it's 2 parts vinegar to 5 parts oil. So, for every 2 parts of vinegar, I need 5 parts of oil.\n\nNow, I have 9 ounces of vinegar, and I need to find out how much oil to mix with it. Hmm, proportions seem like they'll come into play here.\n\nLet me set this up. If 2 parts vinegar correspond to 5 parts oil, then 9 parts vinegar will correspond to how much oil? I can set up a proportion:\n\n2 parts vinegar : 5 parts oil = 9 parts vinegar : x parts oil\n\nSo, 2/5 = 9/x\n\nWait, no. Actually, it's better to think in terms of equivalent ratios. Let's write it as:\n\n2 parts vinegar to 5 parts oil.\n\nSo, vinegar to oil ratio is 2:5.\n\nI have 9 ounces of vinegar, so I need to find the corresponding amount of oil that maintains this ratio.\n\nLet me see. If 2 parts vinegar correspond to 5 parts oil, then 1 part vinegar would correspond to 5/2 parts oil. So, for 9 parts vinegar, it would be 9 times 5/2.\n\nLet me calculate that: 9 * (5/2) = (9*5)/2 = 45/2 = 22.5\n\nSo, 22.5 ounces of oil should be mixed with 9 ounces of vinegar to maintain the ratio of 2 parts vinegar to 5 parts oil.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that. Maybe I can approach it differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find out how many times 2 goes into 9. So, 9 divided by 2 is 4.5. That means I have 4.5 times the original amount of vinegar. So, I should also multiply the oil by 4.5.\n\nSo, 5 parts oil multiplied by 4.5 is 22.5 ounces of oil. Yep, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of cross-multiplying. If I have the ratio 2:5 for vinegar to oil, then for 9 ounces of vinegar, the oil amount x would satisfy:\n\n2/5 = 9/x\n\nWait, actually, no. The correct proportion should be:\n\nvinegar/oil = 2/5 = 9/x\n\nSo, 2/5 = 9/x\n\nThen, cross-multiplying: 2*x = 5*9\n\nSo, 2x = 45\n\nThen, x = 45/2 = 22.5 ounces of oil.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. Good, consistent results from different methods. I think that's solid.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. The problem says \"2 parts vinegar with 5 parts oil.\" Assuming these are parts by volume, since we're dealing with ounces as a unit of volume here.\n\nWait, actually, ounces can be used for both volume and weight, but in cooking, ounces typically refer to fluid ounces for liquids. But in this problem, it's not specified whether it's fluid ounces or ounces by weight. However, since it's a math problem and not a cooking one, I'll assume it's referring to volume.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's assume it's fluid ounces for both vinegar and oil.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the densities of vinegar and oil are the same. Since they're different substances, their densities are different. However, in ratio problems like this, we usually assume that the units are directly comparable, especially since the problem doesn't provide density information.\n\nGiven that, I think it's safe to proceed with the ratio approach without adjusting for densities.\n\nSo, based on the ratio 2:5 for vinegar to oil, and having 9 ounces of vinegar, the corresponding oil amount is 22.5 ounces.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 2\n\nB. 3.6\n\nC. 22.5\n\nD. 63\n\nSo, option C is 22.5, which matches my calculation.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider if there's any other context that might change this answer. The problem seems straightforward: it's about maintaining a proportion given a ratio.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here, like units conversion or anything like that. It's a direct proportionality problem.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 22.5 ounces of oil.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
