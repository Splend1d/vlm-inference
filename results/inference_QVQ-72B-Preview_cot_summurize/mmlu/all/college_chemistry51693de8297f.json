                    "text": "So I have this question about Raoult's law and binary liquid mixtures. It's been a while since I've looked at Raoult's law, but I think I can figure this out. Let's see what Raoult's law actually says.\n\nRaoult's law is about the vapor pressure of solutions, right? It applies to ideal solutions where the components mix perfectly and their intermolecular interactions are similar to those in the pure components. The law states that the partial vapor pressure of each component in a solution is equal to the vapor pressure of the pure component multiplied by its mole fraction in the solution.\n\nSo, for a binary mixture, if we have components A and B, the partial pressure of A would be P_A = X_A * P_A^pure, and similarly for B, P_B = X_B * P_B^pure, where X_A and X_B are the mole fractions of A and B in the liquid mixture, and P_A^pure and P_B^pure are the vapor pressures of the pure components A and B.\n\nLooking at statement I: \"The partial pressure of each component at equilibrium is proportional to its mole fraction in the liquid mixture.\"\n\nYeah, that sounds exactly like Raoult's law. The partial pressure is directly proportional to the mole fraction, provided that the pure component's vapor pressure is a constant. So, this seems to be true.\n\nStatement II: \"The volume of the mixture is equal to the sum of the volumes of each component before mixing.\"\n\nHmm, this is about additive volumes in ideal mixtures. In ideal solutions, volumes are additive, meaning that the total volume is indeed the sum of the individual volumes before mixing. However, I recall that in real mixtures, volumes aren't always additive due to things like changes in intermolecular interactions or molecular packing.\n\nBut wait, Raoult's law applies to ideal solutions, where volumes are additive. So, in that case, this statement should be true for ideal mixtures obeying Raoult's law.\n\nStatement III: \"Intermolecular interactions in the mixture are identical to intermolecular interactions in the pure components.\"\n\nThis is essentially the defining characteristic of an ideal solution. In ideal solutions, the intermolecular interactions between unlike molecules (A-B) are the same as those between like molecules (A-A and B-B). This means that there's no heat released or absorbed upon mixing, and the free energy changes are only entropic.\n\nSo, for a binary liquid mixture to obey Raoult's law, it must be an ideal solution, and thus, this statement must be true.\n\nWait a minute, the question is asking which of these statements must be true about a binary liquid mixture that obeys Raoult's law. So, if all three statements are necessary conditions for a mixture to obey Raoult's law, then the answer should be D. I, II, and III.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is it possible that a mixture obeys Raoult's law without having additive volumes?\n\nActually, in ideal solutions, volumes are additive. So, if a mixture obeys Raoult's law, it should also have additive volumes, meaning statement II must be true.\n\nSimilarly, if a mixture obeys Raoult's law, it must have intermolecular interactions that are the same as those in the pure components, which makes statement III true.\n\nTherefore, all three statements must be true for a binary liquid mixture that obeys Raoult's law.\n\nI think the answer is D. I, II, and III.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
