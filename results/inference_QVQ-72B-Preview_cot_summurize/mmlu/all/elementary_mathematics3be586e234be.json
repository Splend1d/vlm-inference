                    "text": "So I've got this equation to solve: -17.02 equals -2.3 times y. I need to find out what y is, and then check my answer to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me see...\n\nFirst, I need to solve for y. The equation is:\n\n-17.02 = -2.3y\n\nI think I should isolate y by dividing both sides of the equation by -2.3. That should give me y by itself on one side.\n\nSo, dividing both sides by -2.3:\n\ny = -17.02 \u00f7 -2.3\n\nHmm, dividing negatives should give a positive result, right? Because negative divided by negative is positive.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n-17.02 \u00f7 -2.3\n\nWell, 17.02 divided by 2.3.\n\nI can think of it as 17.02 \u00f7 2.3.\n\nFirst, I'll adjust the decimal points to make it easier. If I multiply both numerator and denominator by 10, it becomes 170.2 \u00f7 23.\n\nNow, 23 times 7 is 161, and 170 minus 161 is 9, so 7 point something.\n\nWait, maybe I should use long division.\n\nLet me set it up properly.\n\n23 goes into 170 how many times?\n\n23 times 7 is 161, which is less than 170. 23 times 8 is 184, which is too big.\n\nSo, 7 times 23 is 161.\n\nSubtract 161 from 170: 9.\n\nBring down the next digit, which is 2, making it 92.\n\n23 goes into 92 four times because 23 times 4 is 92.\n\nSubtract 92 from 92: 0.\n\nSo, the division is exactly 7.4.\n\nTherefore, y = 7.4.\n\nOkay, so y equals 7.4.\n\nNow, I need to check my answer to make sure it's correct.\n\nTo check, I'll plug y back into the original equation and see if both sides equal each other.\n\nSo, plug y = 7.4 into -2.3y:\n\n-2.3 times 7.4.\n\nFirst, 2.3 times 7 is 16.1, and then 2.3 times 0.4 is 0.92. Adding those together, 16.1 plus 0.92 is 17.02.\n\nBut since there's a negative sign in front of 2.3, it's -2.3 times 7.4, which is -17.02.\n\nAnd the original equation had -17.02 equal to -2.3y.\n\nSo, -17.02 = -17.02.\n\nThat checks out perfectly.\n\nWait a minute, the options provided are:\n\nA. 7.4\n\nB. -7.4\n\nC. -19.32\n\nD. 14.72\n\nSince my calculation gave me y = 7.4, and checking it confirms that it's correct, I can be confident that A. 7.4 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if y could be -7.4.\n\nIf y = -7.4, then -2.3 times -7.4.\n\nNegative times negative is positive, so -2.3 times -7.4 equals 17.02.\n\nBut the original equation has -17.02 on the left side, so 17.02 would not equal -17.02.\n\nSo, y cannot be -7.4.\n\nSimilarly, let's check y = -19.32.\n\n-2.3 times -19.32.\n\nAgain, negative times negative is positive.\n\nSo, 2.3 times 19.32.\n\n2.3 times 19 is 43.7, and 2.3 times 0.32 is 0.736. Adding them up, 43.7 plus 0.736 is 44.436, which is not equal to -17.02.\n\nSo, y cannot be -19.32.\n\nNext, y = 14.72.\n\n-2.3 times 14.72.\n\nNegative times positive is negative.\n\nSo, -2.3 times 14.72.\n\n2.3 times 14 is 32.2, and 2.3 times 0.72 is 1.656. Adding them up, 32.2 plus 1.656 is 33.856, but with the negative sign, it's -33.856, which is not equal to -17.02.\n\nTherefore, y cannot be 14.72.\n\nSo, after checking all the options, only y = 7.4 satisfies the original equation.\n\nI think that's it. I've solved the equation and checked my answer, and I'm confident that A. 7.4 is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 7.4} \\]"
