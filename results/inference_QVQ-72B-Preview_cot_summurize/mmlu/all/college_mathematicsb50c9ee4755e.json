                    "text": "So I have this problem here: find the shortest distance from the curve xy = 8 to the origin. The options are 4, 8, 16, and 2\u221a2. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that the curve xy = 8 is a hyperbola. I think it's a rectangular hyperbola because xy = 8 can be rewritten as y = 8/x. So, it's symmetric about the x and y axes.\n\nI need to find the point on this hyperbola that's closest to the origin, and then find the distance from that point to the origin.\n\nOne way to do this is to use calculus, maybe Lagrange multipliers or something similar, but that might be a bit heavy for now. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nLet me think about parametrizing the curve. For hyperbolas like xy = 8, I can parametrize it using a parameter t. Let's set x = t, then y = 8/t. So any point on the curve can be represented as (t, 8/t).\n\nNow, the distance from the origin to the point (t, 8/t) is \u221a(t\u00b2 + (8/t)\u00b2). I need to minimize this distance.\n\nTo make it easier, I can minimize the square of the distance, since the square root function is monotonically increasing. So, let's minimize d\u00b2 = t\u00b2 + (8/t)\u00b2.\n\nLet me define f(t) = t\u00b2 + (8/t)\u00b2. I need to find the minimum of f(t).\n\nTo find the minimum, I can take the derivative of f(t) with respect to t and set it to zero.\n\nFirst, find f'(t):\n\nf'(t) = 2t + 2*(8/t)*(-8/t\u00b2) = 2t - 16/t\u00b3.\n\nSet f'(t) = 0:\n\n2t - 16/t\u00b3 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by t\u00b3 to eliminate denominators:\n\n2t\u2074 - 16 = 0\n\n2t\u2074 = 16\n\nt\u2074 = 8\n\nt = (8)^(1/4) = \u221a(\u221a8) = \u221a(2\u221a2) \u2248 1.68\n\nWait, that seems messy. Maybe I can rationalize it.\n\nActually, t\u2074 = 8 implies t = 8^(1/4) = (2^3)^(1/4) = 2^(3/4) = 2^(0.75)\n\nSimilarly, t could be negative, but since x and y are both positive or both negative for xy=8, and the distance to the origin would be the same in both cases, I can consider just the positive t.\n\nNow, t = 2^(3/4), so x = 2^(3/4), y = 8 / 2^(3/4) = 8 * 2^(-3/4) = 2^3 * 2^(-3/4) = 2^(3 - 3/4) = 2^(9/4)\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Maybe I can leave it as y = 8/t, where t = 2^(3/4).\n\nNow, the distance d = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = \u221a(t\u00b2 + (8/t)\u00b2) = \u221a(2^(3/2) + (8/2^(3/4))\u00b2)\n\nThis seems too messy. Maybe there's a better way to parametrize the curve.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that for the hyperbola xy = c\u00b2, the parametric equations can be x = c*t, y = c/t, where t is a parameter.\n\nIn this case, c\u00b2 = 8, so c = \u221a8 = 2\u221a2.\n\nSo, x = 2\u221a2 * t, y = 2\u221a2 / t.\n\nThen, the distance d = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = \u221a((2\u221a2 t)\u00b2 + (2\u221a2 / t)\u00b2) = \u221a(8t\u00b2 + 8/t\u00b2) = \u221a(8(t\u00b2 + 1/t\u00b2))\n\nTo minimize d, minimize t\u00b2 + 1/t\u00b2.\n\nLet me set f(t) = t\u00b2 + 1/t\u00b2.\n\nFind f'(t):\n\nf'(t) = 2t - 2/t\u00b3 = 2(t - 1/t\u00b3)\n\nSet f'(t) = 0:\n\n2(t - 1/t\u00b3) = 0\n\nt - 1/t\u00b3 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by t\u00b3:\n\nt\u2074 - 1 = 0\n\nt\u2074 = 1\n\nt = 1 or t = -1\n\nSo, t = 1 or t = -1.\n\nThen, x = 2\u221a2 *1 = 2\u221a2, y = 2\u221a2 /1 = 2\u221a2.\n\nSimilarly, for t = -1, x = -2\u221a2, y = -2\u221a2.\n\nNow, the distance d = \u221a( (2\u221a2)\u00b2 + (2\u221a2)\u00b2 ) = \u221a(8 + 8) = \u221a16 = 4.\n\nSo, the shortest distance is 4.\n\nLooking back at the options, 4 is one of them.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the geometric interpretation. The curve xy = 8 is symmetric about the lines y = x and y = -x. The origin is at (0,0), and the points closest to the origin on the hyperbola should lie on the line y = x, because that's where the hyperbola comes closest to the origin.\n\nSo, setting y = x, and xy = 8, so x*x = 8, x\u00b2 = 8, x = \u221a8 = 2\u221a2, y = 2\u221a2.\n\nThen, distance = \u221a( (2\u221a2)\u00b2 + (2\u221a2)\u00b2 ) = \u221a(8 + 8) = \u221a16 = 4.\n\nAlternatively, in polar coordinates, x = r cos\u03b8, y = r sin\u03b8, and xy = r\u00b2 cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 = (r\u00b2)/2 sin2\u03b8 = 8.\n\nSo, r\u00b2 = 16 / sin2\u03b8.\n\nThe minimum r occurs when sin2\u03b8 is maximized, which is 1.\n\nSo, r_min = \u221a16 /1 = 4.\n\nAgain, the shortest distance is 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 4.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nIs there a possibility that the minimal distance is not 4? Let's see.\n\nSuppose I consider points where x and y have different signs, but in xy = 8, x and y must have the same sign because their product is positive.\n\nSo, the hyperbola is in the first and third quadrants.\n\nIn the first quadrant, x > 0, y > 0, and in the third quadrant, x < 0, y < 0.\n\nThe distance from the origin to any point (x,y) on the hyperbola is \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nGiven that xy = 8, I can express y in terms of x: y = 8/x.\n\nThen, d = \u221a(x\u00b2 + (8/x)\u00b2) = \u221a(x\u00b2 + 64/x\u00b2)\n\nTo minimize d, minimize x\u00b2 + 64/x\u00b2.\n\nLet me set f(x) = x\u00b2 + 64/x\u00b2.\n\nFind f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 128/x\u00b3\n\nSet f'(x) = 0:\n\n2x - 128/x\u00b3 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by x\u00b3:\n\n2x\u2074 - 128 = 0\n\n2x\u2074 = 128\n\nx\u2074 = 64\n\nx = 64^(1/4) = \u221a(\u221a64) = \u221a8 = 2\u221a2\n\nThen, y = 8 / (2\u221a2) = 4 / \u221a2 = 2\u221a2\n\nSo, x = 2\u221a2, y = 2\u221a2\n\nDistance d = \u221a( (2\u221a2)\u00b2 + (2\u221a2)\u00b2 ) = \u221a(8 + 8) = \u221a16 = 4\n\nAgain, the minimal distance is 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 4.\n\nWait, but let's check if there's a possibility of a shorter distance in the third quadrant where both x and y are negative.\n\nLet x = -a, y = -b, where a,b > 0, and ab = 8.\n\nThen, the distance d = \u221a( (-a)\u00b2 + (-b)\u00b2 ) = \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 )\n\nBut a and b are related by ab = 8.\n\nSo, b = 8/a.\n\nThus, d = \u221a(a\u00b2 + (8/a)\u00b2 )\n\nThis is the same as the expression we had earlier, and the minimal value is still 4.\n\nTherefore, the shortest distance is indeed 4.\n\nSo, the answer is A. 4\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 4} \\]"
