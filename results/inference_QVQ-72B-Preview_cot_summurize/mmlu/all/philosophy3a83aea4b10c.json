                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Hare's view on moral judgments. The statement is that according to Hare, if someone refuses to make any positive moral judgments, then certain consequences follow. The options are:\n\nA. is irrational.\n\nB. is immoral.\n\nC. cannot coherently invoke morality to protect one\u2019s own interests.\n\nD. couldn\u2019t possibly exist.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who Hare is and what his views are. I believe R.M. Hare was an ethical theorist who worked on moral philosophy, particularly on meta-ethics and moral language. He was known for developing a form of prescriptivism or a version of ethical universalism.\n\nNow, the question is about someone who refuses to make any positive moral judgments. A positive moral judgment would be something like \"stealing is wrong\" or \"helping others is good.\" So, this person is not willing to affirm or assert any such positive moral statements.\n\nOption A says such a person is irrational. That would suggest that refusing to make positive moral judgments is against reason or logic. But is that necessarily true? Can't someone reasonably decide not to make moral judgments, perhaps due to moral uncertainty or a belief in moral relativism?\n\nOption B says such a person is immoral. But refusing to make positive moral judgments doesn't necessarily make someone immoral. They might still act in morally acceptable ways, even if they don't explicitly endorse moral statements.\n\nOption C says they cannot coherently invoke morality to protect one\u2019s own interests. This seems interesting. If someone doesn't make positive moral judgments, perhaps they can't consistently appeal to morality when it suits their interests. For example, if they don't believe in saying anything is morally right or wrong, they can't suddenly claim that their interests should be protected for moral reasons.\n\nOption D says such a person couldn't possibly exist. This seems strong. It suggests that it's impossible for someone to refrain from making positive moral judgments. But is that the case? Can't someone choose to abstain from making moral claims?\n\nI need to think about Hare's perspective. Since he worked on moral language and prescriptions, he might argue that moral language is essential for rational discourse and decision-making. If that's the case, perhaps he would argue that refusing to make positive moral judgments is incoherent or irrational.\n\nLet me consider his theory more closely. Hare was associated with prescriptivism, which holds that moral statements are prescriptions about how one ought to act, rather than descriptions of the world. For example, \"stealing is wrong\" is similar to saying \"don't steal.\" If that's the case, then refusing to make positive moral judgments might be seen as refusing to issue any prescriptions about how to act, which could be problematic if one needs to guide their behavior or the behavior of others.\n\nMoreover, if morality is about providing reasons for action, then someone who doesn't make any positive moral judgments isn't providing any reasons based on morality. This might lead to inconsistencies if they try to use morality selectively.\n\nConsidering this, option C seems particularly relevant. If someone refuses to make positive moral judgments, they might not be able to coherently invoke morality to protect their own interests. For example, if they're faced with a situation where their interests are threatened, and they try to argue that their interests should be protected for moral reasons, but they generally refuse to make moral judgments, their position might be inconsistent.\n\nOption A, being irrational, might also be a possibility if Hare believed that making moral judgments is a rational activity and refusing to do so is against reason. However, it's not entirely clear whether refusing to make moral judgments is necessarily irrational. Someone might have reasons for not making moral judgments, such as a belief in the subjectivity of morality or a desire to remain neutral.\n\nOption B, being immoral, doesn't seem directly supported by just the refusal to make positive moral judgments. Morality involves more than just making judgments; it involves actions and intentions as well. Someone who doesn't make moral judgments but still acts in morally acceptable ways shouldn't be considered immoral solely on that basis.\n\nOption D, that such a person couldn't possibly exist, seems too strong. It's plausible that someone might choose not to make moral judgments, perhaps out of a philosophical commitment or personal preference.\n\nGiven this analysis, option C seems the most plausible. Refusing to make positive moral judgments would prevent someone from coherently invoking morality to protect their own interests. If they haven't made any positive moral judgments, they lack the moral framework to justify protecting their interests on moral grounds.\n\nTo further support this, consider an example. Suppose someone says, \"I never make moral judgments; everything is a matter of individual choice.\" But then, in a situation where their interests are at stake, they say, \"It's morally wrong to harm my interests.\" This seems inconsistent because they're invoking morality to protect themselves after claiming not to make moral judgments.\n\nTherefore, according to Hare's perspective on moral language and prescriptions, it makes sense that refusing to make positive moral judgments would prevent someone from coherently invoking morality to protect their own interests.\n\nSo, the answer should be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
