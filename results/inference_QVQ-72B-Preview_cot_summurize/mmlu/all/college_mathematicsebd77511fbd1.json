                    "text": "So I have this problem: today is Wednesday, and I need to figure out what day of the week it will be \\(10^{10^{10}}\\) days from now. The options are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. Hmm, that's a really big number of days\u2014\\(10^{10^{10}}\\). Just to put that in perspective, \\(10^{10}\\) is 10 billion, and \\(10^{10^{10}}\\) is 10 to the power of 10 billion. That's an astronomically huge number!\n\nBut I don't need to worry about the actual number, because days of the week cycle every 7 days. So, I can think about the remainder when \\(10^{10^{10}}\\) is divided by 7, because the day will be the same as today plus that remainder, modulo 7.\n\nWait, but days of the week cycle every 7 days, right? So, if I have a number of days that's a multiple of 7, I'm back to the same day. If it's 1 more than a multiple of 7, it's the next day, and so on.\n\nSo, mathematically, the day \\(d\\) days from now will be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Wednesday} + (d \\mod 7)\n\\]\n\nBut since we're dealing with days of the week, which cycle every 7 days, adding 7 doesn't change the day.\n\nSo, I need to compute \\(10^{10^{10}} \\mod 7\\).\n\nFirst, I need to find the remainder when \\(10^{10^{10}}\\) is divided by 7.\n\nI know that 10 mod 7 is 3, because 10 divided by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 3.\n\nSo, \\(10 \\equiv 3 \\mod 7\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(10^{10^{10}} \\equiv 3^{10^{10}} \\mod 7\\).\n\nNow, I need to compute \\(3^{10^{10}} \\mod 7\\).\n\nI recall that in modular arithmetic, if I have a base and a modulus, and the exponent is large, I can look for a pattern in the powers of the base modulo the modulus.\n\nLet me compute the first few powers of 3 modulo 7 to see if there's a repeating pattern.\n\n\\[\n3^1 = 3 \\mod 7 = 3\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3^2 = 9 \\mod 7 = 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3^3 = 27 \\mod 7 = 6\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3^4 = 81 \\mod 7 = 4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3^5 = 243 \\mod 7 = 5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3^6 = 729 \\mod 7 = 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3^7 = 2187 \\mod 7 = 3\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3^8 = 6561 \\mod 7 = 2\n\\]\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWait a minute, I see that \\(3^6 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7\\), and then \\(3^7 \\equiv 3 \\mod 7\\), which is the same as \\(3^1\\), and so on. So, the pattern repeats every 6 powers.\n\nThis means that the exponents of 3 modulo 7 repeat every 6 exponents.\n\nTherefore, \\(3^{k} \\mod 7\\) is the same as \\(3^{k \\mod 6} \\mod 7\\).\n\nSo, to find \\(3^{10^{10}} \\mod 7\\), I can find \\(10^{10} \\mod 6\\), because \\(10^{10^{10}}\\) is \\(3^{10^{10^{10}}} \\equiv 3^{10^{10} \\mod 6} \\mod 7\\).\n\nSo, I need to find \\(10^{10} \\mod 6\\).\n\nWhat is 10 mod 6? 10 divided by 6 is 1 with a remainder of 4, so \\(10 \\equiv 4 \\mod 6\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(10^{10} \\equiv 4^{10} \\mod 6\\).\n\nNow, I need to compute \\(4^{10} \\mod 6\\).\n\nLet's see, 4 mod 6 is 4.\n\nLet me compute the first few powers of 4 modulo 6 to see if there's a pattern.\n\n\\[\n4^1 = 4 \\mod 6 = 4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4^2 = 16 \\mod 6 = 4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4^3 = 64 \\mod 6 = 4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4^4 = 256 \\mod 6 = 4\n\\]\n\nIt seems like any power of 4 modulo 6 is always 4.\n\nSo, \\(4^{10} \\equiv 4 \\mod 6\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(10^{10} \\equiv 4 \\mod 6\\).\n\nNow, going back, \\(3^{10^{10}} \\equiv 3^4 \\mod 7\\).\n\nBecause \\(10^{10} \\equiv 4 \\mod 6\\), so \\(3^{10^{10}} \\equiv 3^4 \\mod 7\\).\n\nEarlier, I computed \\(3^4 = 81 \\mod 7 = 4\\).\n\nSo, \\(3^{10^{10}} \\equiv 4 \\mod 7\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(10^{10^{10}} \\equiv 4 \\mod 7\\).\n\nNow, since today is Wednesday, and we're adding \\(10^{10^{10}}\\) days, which is equivalent to adding 4 days modulo 7, the day will be 4 days after Wednesday.\n\nLet me list the days starting from Wednesday:\n\nWednesday (0), Thursday (1), Friday (2), Saturday (3), Sunday (4), Monday (5), Tuesday (6).\n\nSo, 4 days after Wednesday is Sunday.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Sunday.\n\nWait a second, but the options are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. So, Sunday is option A.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I established that \\(10 \\equiv 3 \\mod 7\\), so \\(10^{10^{10}} \\equiv 3^{10^{10}} \\mod 7\\).\n\nThen, since the powers of 3 modulo 7 repeat every 6 exponents, \\(3^{k} \\equiv 3^{k \\mod 6} \\mod 7\\).\n\nSo, \\(3^{10^{10}} \\equiv 3^{10^{10} \\mod 6} \\mod 7\\).\n\nThen, \\(10^{10} \\equiv 4^{10} \\mod 6\\), and since \\(4 \\equiv -2 \\mod 6\\), \\(4^{10} \\equiv (-2)^{10} \\mod 6\\).\n\n\\((-2)^{10}\\) is positive because even exponent, and \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which is 4 modulo 6, as \\(1024 \\div 6 = 170\\) with remainder 4.\n\nSo, \\(4^{10} \\equiv 4 \\mod 6\\), which matches what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, \\(3^{10^{10}} \\equiv 3^4 \\mod 7\\), and \\(3^4 = 81 \\equiv 4 \\mod 7\\).\n\nThus, \\(10^{10^{10}} \\equiv 4 \\mod 7\\), and adding 4 days to Wednesday brings us to Sunday.\n\nSo, the answer is A. Sunday.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Sunday}} \\]"
