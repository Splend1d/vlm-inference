                    "text": "So I have this question about skin excoriation, and it's asking what commonly causes it. The options are:\n\nA. A well-fitting pouch.\n\nB. Changing the pouch every day.\n\nC. Leakage of effluent onto peristomal skin.\n\nD. The use of unscented soap to cleanse the skin.\n\nHmm, let's see. I need to recall what skin excoriation is and what causes it, especially in the context of ostomies.\n\nFirst off, skin excoriation generally means damage to the skin, like irritation or erosion. In the case of someone with a stoma (like a colostomy or ileostomy), the skin around the stoma can get irritated.\n\nOption A says a well-fitting pouch. That sounds counterintuitive. If the pouch fits well, shouldn't that protect the skin? Maybe not directly cause excoriation, but perhaps if it's too tight, it could cause pressure and irritation. But generally, a well-fitting pouch is recommended to prevent issues.\n\nOption B is changing the pouch every day. Ostomy pouches are usually changed every 3-7 days, depending on the type and the person's needs. Changing it every day might be unnecessary and could potentially irritate the skin by constantly removing and applying adhesive. But is that the main cause of excoriation?\n\nOption C is leakage of effluent onto peristomal skin. Effluent is the liquid that comes from the stoma, which can be acidic or alkaline, depending on the type of ostomy. If this leaks out of the pouch and comes into contact with the skin around the stoma, it can cause irritation and excoriation. This seems like a likely cause.\n\nOption D is the use of unscented soap to cleanse the skin. Unscented soap is often recommended because scented soaps can contain irritants. So, using unscented soap should be less likely to cause excoriation, not more.\n\nLet me think this through again. If the pouch leaks, the effluent can irritate the skin, leading to excoriation. A well-fitting pouch should prevent leakage, so that would reduce the risk of excoriation. Changing the pouch too frequently might irritate the skin, but it's probably less common than leakage causing excoriation. And using unscented soap is generally advised to avoid irritation.\n\nI think the most common cause among these options is the leakage of effluent onto the peristomal skin. So, my answer would be C.\n\nWait, but let's check some resources to be sure. I recall that in ostomy care, one of the key points is to prevent leakage to protect the skin. There are also products like barriers and pastes that are used to protect the skin from effluent.\n\nMoreover, if effluent leaks and comes into contact with the skin, it can cause various skin issues, including excoriation, dermatitis, and even more severe infections.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that leakage of effluent is a significant cause of skin excoriation in ostomy patients.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Leakage of effluent onto peristomal skin.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
