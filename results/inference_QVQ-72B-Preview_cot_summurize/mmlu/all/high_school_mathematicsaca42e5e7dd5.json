                    "text": "So I have this problem here. It says that f(x) equals some polynomial: ax to the sixth power minus b x to the fourth power plus x minus 1. And it tells me that f(2) equals 5. I need to find f(-2). Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what f(2) being equal to 5 means. It means that when I plug in x = 2 into the function f(x), I get 5. So, f(2) = a*(2)^6 - b*(2)^4 + 2 - 1 = 5.\n\nLet me calculate that. 2 to the sixth power is 64, and 2 to the fourth power is 16. So, it's a*64 - b*16 + 2 - 1 = 5. Let's simplify that: 64a - 16b + 1 = 5.\n\nNow, I need to find f(-2). So, f(-2) = a*(-2)^6 - b*(-2)^4 + (-2) - 1.\n\nLet me calculate (-2)^6 and (-2)^4. (-2)^6 is the same as 2^6 because even powers make the number positive, so it's 64. And (-2)^4 is 16. So, f(-2) = a*64 - b*16 - 2 - 1 = 64a - 16b - 3.\n\nHmm, I already have an expression for 64a - 16b from f(2). From f(2), 64a - 16b + 1 = 5. So, 64a - 16b = 4, because if you subtract 1 from both sides.\n\nWait, so 64a - 16b = 4.\n\nAnd f(-2) = 64a - 16b - 3.\n\nBut 64a - 16b is equal to 4, so f(-2) = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nOh, so f(-2) is 1.\n\nWait, is that it? That seems straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nf(2) = 64a - 16b + 1 = 5.\n\nSo, 64a - 16b = 4.\n\nf(-2) = 64a - 16b - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 1.\n\nWait, but let's see if there's any trick here.\n\nThe problem gives f(x) = ax^6 - bx^4 + x - 1, and f(2) = 5, and asks for f(-2).\n\nI used the value of f(2) to find an expression for 64a - 16b, and then plugged that into f(-2).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a and b separately, but that might be more complicated.\n\nLet me think about it differently.\n\nIf f(x) = ax^6 - bx^4 + x - 1, then f(2) = a*(2)^6 - b*(2)^4 + 2 - 1 = a*64 - b*16 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo, 64a - 16b = 4.\n\nAnd f(-2) = a*(-2)^6 - b*(-2)^4 + (-2) - 1 = a*64 - b*16 - 3.\n\nSo, again, f(-2) = 64a - 16b - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nYes, consistent result.\n\nI think the answer is indeed 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 1} \\]"
