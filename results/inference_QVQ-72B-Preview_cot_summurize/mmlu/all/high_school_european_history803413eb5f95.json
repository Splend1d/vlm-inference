Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here that's comparing two different accounts about the interactions between the Spaniards and the natives in the Americas. One is from Christopher Columbus, and the other is from Bartholomew de las Casas. The question is asking which option best accounts for the differences between these two descriptions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each source is saying. Starting with Source 1, which is from Columbus's letter in 1493. He talks about how the Indians would trade valuable items like cotton and gold for things like fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars. He mentions that he forbade such trades because they were unjust, and instead, he gave the natives many beautiful and acceptable items without taking anything in return. His reasons for doing this were to conciliate them, to make them more inclined to become Christians, and to foster good relations with the Spanish crown and other Spaniards. He also hoped that by doing so, the natives would be more willing to help the Spaniards obtain resources that were abundant in their lands.\n\nNow, moving on to Source 2, which is from de las Casas's \"A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies\" written in 1542. His description is quite different and much grimmer. He portrays the Spanish as ruthless and violent, comparing them to ravenous wolves preying on innocent lambs. He describes how the Spanish inflicted untold misery, suffering, and distress on the natives, using torture and other brutal methods. He also provides a stark statistic: the native population of Hispaniola decreased from three million to just two hundred during this period, attributing this destruction to the Spanish quest for gold and riches.\n\nSo, the two sources present very different pictures of Spanish-native interactions. Columbus's account seems relatively peaceful and even benevolent, while de las Casas's account is filled with horror and destruction.\n\nNow, I need to consider the options provided to explain these differences:\n\nA. De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.\n\nB. Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.\n\nC. Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.\n\nD. De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.\n\nLet me think about each one.\n\nOption A suggests that de las Casas was exaggerating to promote African slavery. I know that de las Casas was a critic of Spanish atrocities in the Americas and advocated for the rights of the natives. However, I don't recall that he supported African slavery. In fact, I think he initially supported the idea of using African slaves instead of natives, but later regretted it and became an advocate against slavery altogether. So, this option might not be accurate.\n\nOption B suggests that Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings. This seems plausible. Columbus was writing about his own actions and likely wanted to present himself in a positive light, especially since his expeditions were funded by the Spanish crown. He might have downplayed any negative aspects of his interactions with the natives or the impacts of his actions.\n\nOption C proposes that Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than later expeditions. This could be possible, as Columbus's initial voyage was exploratory, and his primary goal was to establish friendly relations with the natives to facilitate trade and conversion to Christianity. Later expeditions, however, were often more focused on extracting resources and establishing colonies, which could have led to more conflict and violence against the natives.\n\nOption D suggests that de las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas. De las Casas was known for his criticism of Spanish policies in the New World and advocated for better treatment of the natives. However, I don't think he advocated for the Spanish to leave entirely. Instead, he pushed for reforms to protect the natives from exploitation and abuse.\n\nGiven these considerations, I need to choose the best explanation for the differences between the two accounts.\n\nOne possibility is that both Columbus and de las Casas were biased in their writings. Columbus might have overemphasized the positivity of his interactions to justify his explorations and to maintain support from the Spanish crown. On the other hand, de las Casas might have overemphasized the negativity to highlight the need for reform and to rally support for better treatment of the natives.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the differences are due to the time periods and specific contexts in which each wrote. Columbus was writing shortly after his first voyage in 1493, while de las Casas was writing much later, in 1542, after decades of Spanish presence in the Americas. It's likely that the situation had deteriorated significantly over those fifty years, with more intense exploitation and violence against the natives.\n\nAdditionally, Columbus was describing his own actions and those of his immediate crew, whereas de las Casas was providing a broader account of the Spanish treatment of natives across multiple colonies and over several decades. It's possible that while Columbus's initial interactions were relatively peaceful, subsequent expeditions and colonizers adopted more aggressive and exploitative strategies.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option C, \"Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions,\" is a plausible explanation for the differences in the accounts. This is because Columbus's initial encounter was indeed marked by a desire to establish friendly relations, whereas later expeditions were more focused on extracting resources and subjugating the native populations.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that Columbus's actions might not have been as benign as he portrayed in his letter. It's possible that even in his first voyage, there were instances of exploitation or violence that he didn't mention or downplayed in his writings.\n\nBut based on the information provided in the sources, it seems that Columbus's initial interactions were more peaceful and less violent compared to the descriptions provided by de las Casas several decades later.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option C: Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
