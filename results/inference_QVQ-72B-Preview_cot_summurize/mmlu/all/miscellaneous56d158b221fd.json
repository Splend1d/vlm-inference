Your Grace. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that titles and forms of address can vary depending on the country and the specific noble title. But I think there's a general way to address a duke in English-speaking countries, especially in the British nobility.\n\nLet me recall: In the British peerage, a duke is the highest rank, followed by marquess, earl, viscount, and baron. So, being the highest, I wonder if it's addressed differently from the others.\n\nI remember that a king or queen is addressed as \"Your Majesty,\" so that's probably not the right choice for a duke. \"Your Eminence\" sounds familiar for high religious figures, like the Pope or cardinals, so that might not be appropriate here.\n\n\"What about 'Your Excellency'?\" I think that's used for ambassadors or governors, but I'm not sure about dukes. Maybe sometimes, but I'm not certain.\n\nLastly, there's \"Your Grace.\" I've heard that term used in historical dramas when addressing dukes. For example, \"Your Grace, the Duke of Wellington.\" That seems plausible.\n\nLet me double-check. I think \"Your Grace\" is the standard form of address for a duke in the British peerage. It's also used for other high-ranking nobles in some countries, but in England, it's primarily for dukes.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there are any exceptions or if it differs based on the context. For instance, if the duke is also a monarch, then he might be addressed differently. But assuming it's a duke in the peerage, without any additional royal status, \"Your Grace\" should be the correct form.\n\nI should also consider if there's any difference in how a duke is addressed in writing versus in speech. I believe \"Your Grace\" is used in direct address and in writing, it might be \"The Duke of [Place]\" without any specific form like \"His Grace.\"\n\nWait, maybe I should look up the exact protocol to be sure. But since this is a thought exercise, I'll have to rely on my memory and logical deduction.\n\nAnother thing that comes to mind is that in some contexts, especially in older times, dukes might have been addressed with different titles, but I think \"Your Grace\" is the most consistent and recognized form.\n\nI also recall that in some European countries, dukes might be addressed differently, but since the question is likely referring to the British nobility, \"Your Grace\" should be the answer.\n\nLet me see if there's any other angle to consider. Perhaps thinking about the origins of the title \"duke.\" It comes from the Latin \"dux,\" meaning leader, and it was originally used for military commanders. Over time, it became a title of nobility.\n\nBut I don't think the etymology directly influences the form of address. It's more about the established convention.\n\nI think I've covered all the possible angles here. Based on my knowledge, \"Your Grace\" is the proper way to address a duke.\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. Your Grace.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
