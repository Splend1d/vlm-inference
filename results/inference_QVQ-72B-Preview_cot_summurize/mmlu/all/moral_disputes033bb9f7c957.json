                    "text": " So I'm reading this article by Ashford, and it's about addressing global poverty. There's this idea of \"paralysis\" in the face of something, and the options are given: the sheer scope of global poverty; having to choose between addressing immediate harm and structural injustice; reconciling conflicting moral theories; or having to give up so much of our own wealth because of Singer's arguments. I need to figure out which one Ashford is trying to address.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"paralysis\" means in this context. Paralysis usually means being unable to move or act, so in this case, it's probably referring to feeling overwhelmed or\u65e0\u529b to do anything about global poverty.\n\nNow, option A is the sheer scope of global poverty. That makes sense because global poverty is a huge issue, and it can be daunting to think about how to tackle it. Maybe people feel like their efforts are too small to make a difference.\n\nOption B is having to choose between addressing immediate harm and structural injustice. This seems like a dilemma where you have to decide between helping people right now who are suffering and trying to fix the systems that cause poverty in the first place. It's a tough choice, and maybe people feel paralyzed by not knowing which approach is better.\n\nOption C is reconciling conflicting moral theories. This might involve different philosophical or ethical ideas about what is right and wrong when it comes to helping the poor. If there are conflicting ideas, it could be hard to decide which one to follow.\n\nOption D is about giving up so much of our own wealth because of Singer's arguments. Singer is a philosopher who has written about our moral obligations to the poor, suggesting that we should give much more than we do. So, this option is about the difficulty or resistance people might feel about giving away a significant portion of their wealth.\n\nI need to think about which of these Ashford is focusing on in the article. I should look for clues in the text.\n\nLet me recall some parts of the article. Ashford talks about how global poverty is a vast problem, and people might feel overwhelmed by its size. He mentions that there are different ways to approach the issue, like providing immediate aid or trying to change the underlying structures that cause poverty. He also discusses how different moral theories might suggest different courses of action, which can be confusing.\n\nMoreover, Ashford references Singer's work and discusses the idea of sacrificing our own comfort to help others. So, all of these options seem relevant to some extent.\n\nBut the question is asking specifically about what paralysis Ashford is addressing. Is it the overwhelming nature of poverty, the choice between different approaches, the conflict between moral theories, or the resistance to giving up personal wealth?\n\nI need to think about the main theme of the article. Ashford seems to be focusing on the difficulty of deciding how to act in the face of global poverty, given the complexity of the issue and the various moral perspectives involved.\n\nHe mentions that people might be paralyzed by the sheer scope of the problem, not knowing where to start or if their efforts will make a difference. But he also talks about the dilemma of choosing between addressing immediate needs and addressing the root causes of poverty.\n\nAdditionally, he brings up different moral theories that might conflict in their approach to global poverty, which could cause confusion about the right thing to do.\n\nLastly, he discusses Singer's argument that we have a moral obligation to give a significant portion of our wealth to help the poor, which might be difficult for many people to accept and act upon.\n\nSo, all of these seem to be related to the paralysis Ashford is addressing.\n\nBut if I have to choose one, I need to think about which one is the primary focus.\n\nPerhaps the article is mainly about the choice between addressing immediate harm and structural injustice. That seems like a central dilemma in approaches to global poverty.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about reconciling different moral theories, as that could also lead to paralysis if people can't decide which theory to follow.\n\nBut Ashford does spend time discussing the magnitude of global poverty and how it can be paralyzing.\n\nAlso, he gives significant attention to Singer's views and the idea of sacrificing personal wealth.\n\nWait, maybe the paralysis he's addressing is the overall sense of being overwhelmed and not knowing how to act, given all these factors.\n\nBut the question is asking for a specific aspect, not a general sense of overwhelm.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. the sheer scope of global poverty.\n\nB. having to choose between addressing immediate harm and addressing structural injustice.\n\nC. reconciling conflicting moral theories.\n\nD. having to give up so much of our own wealth in light of Singer's arguments.\n\nI think the best answer is B. having to choose between addressing immediate harm and addressing structural injustice.\n\nHere's why: Ashford spends time discussing both approaches\u2014providing immediate aid versus trying to change the systems that cause poverty. He explores the pros and cons of each approach and how they might lead to different actions.\n\nMoreover, he mentions that this choice can be paralyzing because both options seem necessary but require different types of commitment and resources.\n\nWhile the other options are also relevant, I think the choice between immediate aid and structural change is a central theme in the article and is the specific paralysis Ashford is addressing.\n\nSo, my answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
