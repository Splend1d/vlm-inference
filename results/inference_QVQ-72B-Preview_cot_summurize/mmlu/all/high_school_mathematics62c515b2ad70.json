                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: If f(3) = 8 and f'(3) = -4, then f(3.02) is approximately... and there are multiple choices. Okay, so I need to estimate the value of the function at 3.02 using the information given at x=3.\n\nFirst, I remember that the derivative of a function at a point represents the instantaneous rate of change of the function at that point. So, f'(3) = -4 means that at x=3, the function is decreasing at a rate of 4 units per unit increase in x.\n\nNow, I need to find f(3.02). Since 3.02 is very close to 3, I can use the linear approximation of the function near x=3 to estimate this value.\n\nThe linear approximation formula is:\n\nf(x + \u0394x) \u2248 f(x) + f'(x) * \u0394x\n\nHere, x = 3, \u0394x = 3.02 - 3 = 0.02\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nf(3.02) \u2248 8 + (-4) * 0.02\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n8 + (-0.08) = 8 - 0.08 = 7.92\n\nSo, f(3.02) is approximately 7.92.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. -8.08\n\nB. 7.92\n\nC. 7.98\n\nD. 8.02\n\nIt seems like B. 7.92 is the correct choice.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the sign of the derivative. Since the derivative is negative, the function is decreasing at x=3. So, as x increases by 0.02, the function value decreases by 4 times 0.02, which is 0.08, so yes, f(3.02) = 8 - 0.08 = 7.92.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the definition of the derivative:\n\nf'(x) = lim (h->0) [f(x + h) - f(x)] / h\n\nGiven f'(3) = -4, this means:\n\nf(3 + h) - f(3) \u2248 -4 * h for small h.\n\nSo, f(3 + h) \u2248 f(3) - 4h\n\nTherefore, f(3.02) \u2248 8 - 4*0.02 = 8 - 0.08 = 7.92\n\nYeah, I'm pretty confident with this calculation.\n\nWait, but let's see if there's any other factor that could affect this.\n\nIs there any second-order term or something like that? Well, since we're dealing with a linear approximation, which is based on the tangent line, and we only have the first derivative, higher-order terms aren't considered here. So, 7.92 should be the correct approximation.\n\nMaybe I should consider the function's concavity, but that would require the second derivative, which isn't provided here. Without that, I can't account for any curvature in the function, so I have to assume that the linear approximation is sufficient for this small change in x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function isn't linear, and the approximation might not be perfect, but since it's a calculus problem and we're using differentials, the linear approximation should be accurate enough for such a small \u0394x.\n\nLet me see if maybe there's a different approach to this problem.\n\nSuppose f(x) is a differentiable function, and we know f(3) and f'(3). To find f(3.02), we can use the differential dx = 0.02 and df \u2248 f'(x) dx.\n\nSo, df \u2248 -4 * 0.02 = -0.08\n\nThen, f(3.02) = f(3) + df = 8 - 0.08 = 7.92\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of the tangent line equation:\n\nThe equation of the tangent line at x=3 is:\n\ny - f(3) = f'(3)(x - 3)\n\nSo, y = f(3) + f'(3)(x - 3) = 8 - 4(x - 3) = 8 - 4x + 12 = -4x + 20\n\nWait, that can't be right, because if x=3, y = -4*3 + 20 = -12 + 20 = 8, which matches f(3), but at x=3.02:\n\ny = -4*(3.02) + 20 = -12.08 + 20 = 7.92\n\nAgain, the same value.\n\nSo, all these methods point to f(3.02) \u2248 7.92.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the function could be something else.\n\nSuppose f(x) = -2x^2 + 2x + 14\n\nThen f'(x) = -4x + 2\n\nAt x=3, f(3) = -2*(9) + 6 + 14 = -18 + 6 + 14 = 2\n\nWait, that doesn't match f(3)=8, so that's not the right function.\n\nAlternatively, f(x) = -2x^2 + 6x + 8\n\nf(3) = -2*(9) + 18 + 8 = -18 + 18 + 8 = 8\n\nf'(x) = -4x + 6\n\nf'(3) = -12 + 6 = -6, which doesn't match f'(3)=-4.\n\nHmm, maybe f(x) = -2x^2 + 4x + 10\n\nf(3) = -18 + 12 + 10 = -18 + 22 = 4, not 8.\n\nWait, perhaps f(x) = -x^2 + 4x + 5\n\nf(3) = -9 + 12 + 5 = -9 + 17 = 8\n\nf'(x) = -2x + 4\n\nf'(3) = -6 + 4 = -2, which doesn't match f'(3)=-4.\n\nHmm, maybe f(x) = -2x^2 + 4x + 10 - I miscalculated earlier.\n\nWait, f(x) = -x^2 + 4x + 5 gives f(3)=8 and f'(x)=-2x+4, so f'(3)=-6+4=-2, which is not -4.\n\nAlternatively, f(x) = -x^2 + 2x + 7\n\nf(3) = -9 + 6 + 7 = 4, not 8.\n\nWait, perhaps f(x) = -x^2 + 4x + 5 - I already did that.\n\nAlternatively, f(x) = -x^2 + 6x + 2\n\nf(3) = -9 + 18 + 2 = 11, not 8.\n\nHmm, maybe f(x) = -x^2 + 4x + 8\n\nf(3) = -9 + 12 + 8 = 11, still not 8.\n\nWait, perhaps f(x) = -x^2 + 4x + 8 - same as above.\n\nWait, maybe f(x) = -x^2 + 4x + 8, but f(3)=11, not 8.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the function isn't a quadratic. Maybe it's exponential or something else, but the problem doesn't specify.\n\nBut actually, the exact form of the function doesn't matter for the linear approximation, as long as we know f(3) and f'(3).\n\nSo, sticking to the linear approximation, f(3.02) \u2248 7.92.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. -8.08\n\nB. 7.92\n\nC. 7.98\n\nD. 8.02\n\nB seems correct.\n\nBut to be extra sure, let's consider if there's any possibility of a typo or misinterpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the derivative is f'(3) = -4, but perhaps the function is decreasing, so f(3.02) could be higher or lower?\n\nWait, no. Since the derivative is negative, the function is decreasing. So, as x increases from 3 to 3.02, f(x) decreases from 8 to slightly less than 8.\n\nSo, f(3.02) should be less than 8, which 7.92 satisfies.\n\nAlternatively, if f'(3) was positive, f(x) would be increasing, but in this case, it's negative, so it's decreasing.\n\nTherefore, f(3.02) \u2248 7.92.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7.92} \\]"
