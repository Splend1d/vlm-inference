                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what one stroke over par is in golf. The options are eagle, bogey, dormy, or birdie. Hmm, I need to recall what each of these terms means in golf terminology.\n\nFirst off, I know that \"par\" is the standard number of strokes expected for a hole or an entire golf course. So, if a hole is par 4, for example, the average golfer is expected to complete it in four strokes.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Eagle: I think an eagle is when a golfer scores two strokes under par for a hole. So, for a par 4, an eagle would be completing it in two strokes. That's really good, but not what we're looking for here.\n\nB. Bogey: This sounds familiar as a term for one stroke over par. Let me think if that's correct. If par is 4, then a bogey would be 5 strokes. Is that right?\n\nC. Dormy: I'm not as familiar with this term in golf. Maybe it's related to match play or something? I think it might refer to a situation where a player is dormie, meaning they can afford to lose a certain number of holes and still not lose the match. But I'm not sure.\n\nD. Birdie: I know that a birdie is one stroke under par for a hole. So, for a par 4, a birdie would be three strokes. That's better than par, but not as good as an eagle.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check these definitions to make sure I'm not mixing them up.\n\nLet me consider that:\n\n- Eagle: typically two strokes under par for a hole.\n\n- Birdie: one stroke under par.\n\n- Par: the standard number of strokes.\n\n- Bogey: one stroke over par.\n\n- Double bogey: two strokes over par.\n\n- And so on.\n\nSo, based on this, one stroke over par should be called a bogey.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about an example. Say we have a par 3 hole:\n\n- Eagle: 1 stroke (which seems impossible for a par 3, unless it's a hole-in-one, which is an ace, but that's another term).\n\n- Birdie: 2 strokes.\n\n- Par: 3 strokes.\n\n- Bogey: 4 strokes.\n\nSo, in this case, one stroke over par is bogey.\n\nAnother example, a par 4 hole:\n\n- Eagle: 2 strokes.\n\n- Birdie: 3 strokes.\n\n- Par: 4 strokes.\n\n- Bogey: 5 strokes.\n\nAgain, one over par is bogey.\n\nAnd for a par 5:\n\n- Eagle: 3 strokes.\n\n- Birdie: 4 strokes.\n\n- Par: 5 strokes.\n\n- Bogey: 6 strokes.\n\nSame pattern.\n\nSo, it seems consistent that bogey is one stroke over par.\n\nNow, about dormy. I'm still unclear on what exactly it means in this context. Since the question is specifically about stroke play, I think dormy isn't directly related here. It might be more associated with match play scenarios.\n\nTherefore, based on my understanding, the correct answer should be B. bogey.\n\nJust to confirm, I'll check online or in a golf rule book. Oh, wait, since this is a written response, I don't have access to external resources right now. But from what I recall, bogey is indeed one stroke over par.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. bogey}} \\]"
