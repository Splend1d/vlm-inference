                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this economics problem about supply and demand for grapes. It says that both demand and supply increase at the same time, and I need to figure out what happens to the equilibrium quantity and price. The options are a bit confusing, especially with terms like \"ambiguous,\" but I'll try to work through it.\n\nFirst, I remember that demand is like how much people want to buy at different prices, and supply is how much producers are willing to sell at those prices. Equilibrium is when demand equals supply, right? So, if both demand and supply increase, I need to see how that affects the equilibrium point.\n\nLet me draw a quick mental picture. The demand curve is usually downward sloping, meaning higher prices lead to lower quantity demanded, and supply is upward sloping, meaning higher prices lead to higher quantity supplied.\n\nIf demand increases, that typically shifts the demand curve to the right. So, at each price, people want to buy more. At the same time, supply increases, which shifts the supply curve to the right as well, meaning producers are willing to supply more at each price.\n\nNow, if both curves shift to the right, what happens to the equilibrium price and quantity?\n\nI think the equilibrium quantity increases because both shifts suggest more buying and more selling at higher levels. But what about the price? That's where it gets tricky.\n\nOption A says equilibrium quantity rises, but the price change is ambiguous. Option B says quantity falls and price change is ambiguous. Option C says quantity rises and price rises. Option D says quantity falls and price falls.\n\nGiven that both demand and supply increase, which should shift their respective curves to the right, I would initially think that quantity increases. So options B and D, which say quantity falls, might not be correct.\n\nBut then, about the price, it's not as clear. If demand increases, that tends to pull the price up, but if supply increases, that tends to push the price down. So, it's like there's a tug of war between these two forces.\n\nLet me try to think of it in terms of the specific elasticities of demand and supply. If demand increases by a certain percentage and supply increases by another percentage, the net effect on price would depend on which increase is larger or on the slopes of the curves.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the equilibrium condition. At the new equilibrium, quantity demanded equals quantity supplied, both at the new equilibrium price.\n\nSo, after both shifts, the quantity demanded at the new equilibrium price is higher than before, and the quantity supplied is also higher.\n\nBut for the price, it's not straightforward. It depends on the relative magnitudes of the shifts in demand and supply.\n\nLet me consider an extreme case. Suppose demand increases a tiny bit, and supply increases a lot. In that case, the price might decrease because the large increase in supply leads to a surplus, pulling the price down.\n\nOn the other hand, if supply increases a tiny bit and demand increases a lot, the price might increase because the increase in demand is stronger.\n\nSo, without knowing the exact magnitudes of the increases in demand and supply, it's hard to say whether the price will go up or down. It could go either way, depending on which increase is larger.\n\nTherefore, the price change is ambiguous, meaning it could rise or fall based on the relative changes in demand and supply.\n\nGiven that, option A seems to be the most accurate: equilibrium quantity rises, but the price change is ambiguous.\n\nOption C says quantity rises and price rises, but that's only one possibility. It's possible that price rises, but it could also fall, depending on the circumstances.\n\nSimilarly, option D says quantity falls and price falls, but that doesn't seem to align with both increases in demand and supply shifting to the right.\n\nOption B says quantity falls and price change is ambiguous, but if both curves shift to the right, quantity should increase, not decrease.\n\nTherefore, I think option A is the correct choice.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the standard supply and demand diagrams. If demand shifts right and supply shifts right, the equilibrium quantity definitely increases. The equilibrium price, however, depends on the relative shifts. If supply increases more than demand, price decreases. If demand increases more than supply, price increases.\n\nSo, yes, without knowing the exact magnitudes of the shifts, the price change is indeed ambiguous. Therefore, the correct answer should be option A: equilibrium quantity rises, but the price change is ambiguous.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
