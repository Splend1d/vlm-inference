                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a new product that's expected to sell at $19.00 per unit. Management wants a 20% contribution margin on all sales. The variable selling and distribution costs are $3.00 per unit. We need to find the target variable manufacturing cost. The options are A. $12.20, B. $12.80, C. $15.80, and D. $18.20.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a contribution margin is. I recall that the contribution margin is the amount of revenue left after covering the variable costs, which contributes towards covering fixed costs and then profit. It's usually expressed as a percentage of sales.\n\nSo, contribution margin percentage = (Sales - Variable costs) / Sales.\n\nManagement wants a 20% contribution margin on all sales. That means that 20% of the sales revenue should be the contribution margin.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nSales price per unit = $19.00\n\nVariable selling and distribution costs = $3.00 per unit\n\nLet\u2019s denote the variable manufacturing cost as VM.\n\nSo, total variable cost per unit = VM + $3.00.\n\nThe contribution margin per unit is Sales price - Total variable cost = $19.00 - (VM + $3.00) = $19.00 - VM - $3.00 = $16.00 - VM.\n\nBut we need to express the contribution margin in terms of the contribution margin percentage.\n\nThe contribution margin ratio is (Contribution margin per unit) / Sales price per unit = ($16.00 - VM) / $19.00.\n\nManagement wants this ratio to be 20%, or 0.20 in decimal form.\n\nSo, ($16.00 - VM) / $19.00 = 0.20.\n\nNow, I can solve for VM.\n\nMultiply both sides by $19.00:\n\n$16.00 - VM = 0.20 * $19.00\n\n$16.00 - VM = $3.80\n\nNow, subtract $16.00 from both sides:\n\n-VM = $3.80 - $16.00\n\n-VM = -$12.20\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nVM = $12.20\n\nSo, the target variable manufacturing cost is $12.20 per unit.\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\nIf VM = $12.20, then total variable cost = $12.20 + $3.00 = $15.20.\n\nContribution margin per unit = $19.00 - $15.20 = $3.80.\n\nContribution margin ratio = $3.80 / $19.00 = 0.20 or 20%, which matches the management's goal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. $12.20.\n\nI think that makes sense. If I had to explain this to someone else, I'd say that the contribution margin is the difference between the sales price and the total variable costs. Management wants this margin to be 20% of sales. Given the variable selling and distribution costs, I can find the variable manufacturing cost that satisfies this condition.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes contribution margin can be defined differently in various contexts, so maybe I should confirm the formula I'm using.\n\nAnother way to look at it is:\n\nContribution margin per unit = Sales price per unit - Variable cost per unit.\n\nAnd contribution margin ratio = Contribution margin per unit / Sales price per unit.\n\nGiven that, and knowing that management wants the contribution margin ratio to be 20%, we can set up the equation as above.\n\nI think the approach is correct. The key is to recognize that the total variable cost includes both the manufacturing and selling/distribution costs.\n\nSo, again, VM + $3.00 = Total variable cost.\n\nAnd Sales - Total variable cost = Contribution margin.\n\nAnd Contribution margin / Sales = 20%.\n\nPlugging in the numbers leads us back to VM = $12.20.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is A. $12.20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ \\$12.20} \\]"
