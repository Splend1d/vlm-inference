                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to figure out which of these options won't work for preparing a buffer solution. I remember that a buffer is supposed to resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. So, it usually consists of a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid.\n\nOption A says mixing a solution of a weak base with a strong acid. Hmm, let's think about that. When you mix a weak base with a strong acid, the strong acid will react with the weak base to form the conjugate acid of the weak base and some salt. So, for example, if you have ammonia (a weak base) and hydrochloric acid (a strong acid), they'll react to form ammonium chloride and water. The resulting solution will have ammonium ions, which are the conjugate acid of ammonia, and chloride ions from the strong acid. This could act as a buffer because you have a weak acid (ammonium ion) and its conjugate base (ammonia). So, actually, this can be used to prepare a buffer.\n\nOption B is mixing a solution of a weak acid with a strong base. Similar to option A, when you mix a weak acid with a strong base, the strong base will react with the weak acid to form the conjugate base of the weak acid and some salt. For example, acetic acid (weak acid) and sodium hydroxide (strong base) will react to form sodium acetate and water. The resulting solution will have acetate ions, which are the conjugate base of acetic acid, and sodium ions. This can also act as a buffer because you have a weak base (acetate ion) and its conjugate acid (acetic acid). So, this should also work for preparing a buffer.\n\nOption C is mixing a solution of a strong base with a strong acid. Now, this seems different. When you mix a strong base with a strong acid, they will completely react to form water and a salt. For example, sodium hydroxide (strong base) and hydrochloric acid (strong acid) will react to form sodium chloride and water. The resulting solution will be neutral, and it won't have any weak acid or weak base components to act as a buffer. So, this probably can't be used to prepare a buffer.\n\nOption D is mixing a solution of a weak acid with its conjugate base. This seems straightforward. For example, mixing acetic acid with sodium acetate. You have the weak acid and its conjugate base directly. This is a classic way to prepare a buffer solution because the weak acid and its conjugate base can resist changes in pH by reacting with added acids or bases.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option C\u2014mixing a solution of a strong base with a strong acid\u2014won't result in a buffer solution because it will just produce water and a salt, without any weak acid or base components to resist pH changes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
