Message Integrity, C. Message Splashing, D. Message Sending. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, let's break down what the question is asking. It's about ensuring that data received is identical to the data sent. So, it's about preserving the accuracy and completeness of the information during transmission.\n\nOption A is Message Confidentiality. I think confidentiality is about keeping the information secret or private, so that only authorized parties can access it. But that doesn't directly relate to ensuring the data arrives unchanged. Maybe it's not the right choice.\n\nOption B is Message Integrity. This sounds like it's about making sure the message hasn't been altered or tampered with during transmission. That seems closely related to ensuring the data arrives exactly as it was sent. Maybe this is the correct answer.\n\nOption C is Message Splashing. I'm not familiar with this term in the context of data transmission. Maybe it's a typo or an obscure term. In any case, it doesn't seem relevant to the concept of ensuring data arrives unchanged.\n\nOption D is Message Sending. This seems too vague. Sending a message just means transmitting it, but it doesn't guarantee that it arrives in the same form. So, probably not the right answer.\n\nLet me double-check. In computer security, confidentiality, integrity, and availability are often referred to as the CIA trilogy. Confidentiality is about protecting data from unauthorized access, integrity is about ensuring data is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner, and availability is about ensuring that authorized users have access to the data when needed.\n\nGiven that, message integrity aligns with the concept of ensuring that data arrives exactly as it was sent. It's about maintaining the consistency and reliability of the information during transmission.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is B. Message Integrity.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any other context or if the question could be interpreted differently. For example, could \"message splashing\" be a term for data integrity? I don't think so. It seems like it might be a miswritten term or something unrelated.\n\nAlright, after considering all the options, I'm confident that B. Message Integrity is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
