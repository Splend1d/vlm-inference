                    "text": "Let's see here. Dari Inc. has guaranteed the debt of a related party, and now it looks like they'll probably have to pay somewhere between $150,000 and $200,000 within the next six months because of that guarantee. The thing is, within that range, no specific amount is more likely than another. So, I need to figure out how much of a contingent liability Dari should accrue on its balance sheet as of December 31.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a contingent liability is. It's a potential obligation that depends on a future event. In this case, it's probable that Dari will have to pay, and the amount can be estimated within a range, but no specific amount is more likely. That sounds like a situation where an accrual is appropriate.\n\nNow, according to accounting principles, when you have a range of possible amounts and no single amount within that range is more likely, you're supposed to accrue the minimum amount of the range. So, in this scenario, that would be $150,000.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check. I recall that when you have a range of possible losses and no point within that range is more likely, you should recognize the lowest amount in the range. Yeah, that sounds familiar. It's because you need to be conservative and only recognize the amount that's almost certain to be a liability.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's consider the options:\n\nA. $200,000 \u2013 This is the highest amount in the range. Typically, you wouldn't accrue the highest amount unless that was the most likely scenario, which isn't the case here.\n\nB. $175,000 \u2013 This is the midpoint of the range. Sometimes, people might think to take the average, but in accounting, when no amount is more likely, you're supposed to use the minimum, not the average.\n\nC. $150,000 \u2013 This seems to be the correct choice based on accounting standards for contingencies.\n\nD. 0 \u2013 Well, that can't be right because it's probable that they will have to pay, so they can't ignore it.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer should be C. $150,000.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way to look at this. Maybe I should consider the concept of \"reasonable estimate.\" In accounting, when you have a range of possible outcomes, and no specific amount within the range is more likely, you should use the lowest amount in the range. That aligns with being cautious and not overstatement liabilities.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that if you were to accrue the average or the highest amount, you might be overestimating the liability, which isn't consistent with the information given. The company only knows that it's somewhere between $150,000 and $200,000, but no specific amount is more likely. Therefore, the most conservative and appropriate amount to accrue is the minimum, which is $150,000.\n\nI should also consider if there's any disclosure required for the range. Even if they accrue the minimum, they might need to disclose the possible loss range in the notes to the financial statements. But that's a separate issue from the accrual itself.\n\nSo, to sum it up, Dari Inc. should accrue $150,000 as a contingent liability on its December 31 balance sheet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
