                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that at a college, approximately 2 out of 5 seniors go on to attend graduate school. And there are 750 seniors at the college. I need to figure out how many of those seniors would be expected to attend graduate school. The options are A. 75 seniors, B. 107 seniors, C. 300 seniors, and D. 400 seniors.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. So, first, I know that 2 out of 5 seniors go to graduate school. That sounds like a ratio, right? So, 2 to 5 can be written as a fraction: 2/5.\n\nNow, I have 750 seniors in total. I need to find out how many of those are expected to go to graduate school based on this ratio.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to multiply the total number of seniors by the fraction that goes to graduate school.\n\nSo, if 2 out of 5 seniors go to graduate school, then the number going to graduate school would be 2/5 multiplied by the total number of seniors.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber going to graduate school = (2/5) * 750\n\nOkay, now I need to calculate that.\n\nFirst, I'll divide 750 by 5.\n\n750 divided by 5 is 150.\n\nThen, multiply that by 2.\n\n150 * 2 = 300.\n\nSo, 300 seniors would be expected to attend graduate school.\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\nIf 2 out of 5 seniors go to graduate school, then indeed, 2/5 * 750 equals 300.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 300 seniors seems to be the correct answer.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using percentages or something, but that might be more complicated than necessary.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the proportion.\n\nThe proportion of seniors attending graduate school is 2/5.\n\nSo, proportionately, out of 750, how many equal 2/5 of the total?\n\nAgain, that's the same as multiplying 750 by 2/5, which gives 300.\n\nI don't see any tricks here; it seems straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider whether \"approximately\" means I need to round or something, but since the numbers are exact, I don't think that's necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that \"approximately 2 out of 5\" could imply a probability, but given that it's a ratio, I think treating it as an exact fraction is appropriate.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is C. 300 seniors.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could influence this.\n\nIs there any reason to think that the number isn't exactly 300? For example, maybe the number isn't divisible by 5, but since 750 is divisible by 5, and 2 and 5 are coprime, the calculation works out cleanly.\n\nAlso, considering the options, 75 is way too low, 107 is still low, 300 seems just right, and 400 is higher than what the ratio would suggest.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. 300 seniors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
