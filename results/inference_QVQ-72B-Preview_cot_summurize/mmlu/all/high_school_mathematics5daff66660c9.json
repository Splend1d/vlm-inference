                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out on what day of the week April will start in 2011. I know that February 2011 had 28 days and March had 31 days. Hmm, maybe I can work backwards from that.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what day of the week March 1, 2011, was. But I don't know that off the top of my head. Maybe I can find a way to calculate it.\n\nI remember that a common year has 365 days, and a leap year has 366 days. Since 2011 is not a leap year\u2014it's not divisible by 4\u2014I know February had 28 days, which matches what's given.\n\nLet me think about the number of days in each month:\n\n- January: 31\n\n- February: 28\n\n- March: 31\n\n- April: 30\n\n- May: 31\n\n- June: 30\n\n- July: 31\n\n- August: 31\n\n- September: 30\n\n- October: 31\n\n- November: 30\n\n- December: 31\n\nSo, from January 1st to March 1st, the total days are:\n\nJanuary: 31 days\n\nFebruary: 28 days\n\nTotal: 31 + 28 = 59 days\n\nNow, if I know what day of the week January 1st, 2011, was, I could add 59 days to that and find out what day March 1st is.\n\nBut I don't know what day January 1st was in 2011. Maybe there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of Zeller's Congruence or some other formula to calculate the day of the week for a given date. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nWait, maybe I can look up a calendar for 2011 to see what day April starts on. But since this is a problem, maybe I'm supposed to calculate it somehow.\n\nLet me consider that each week has 7 days. So, every 7 days, the days of the week repeat.\n\nGiven that February has 28 days, which is 4 weeks, so it ends on the same day of the week that it started.\n\nSimilarly, March has 31 days, which is 4 weeks and 3 days, so it ends on the day of the week that is 3 days after the start.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of days from a known day.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nSuppose February 1st is a certain day of the week. Since February has 28 days, February 28th is also on that same day.\n\nThen, March 1st would be the next day, so it would be one day after February 28th's day.\n\nMarch has 31 days, so March 31st would be 31 days after March 1st. Since 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days, March 31st would be 3 days after March 1st's day.\n\nThen, April 1st would be the next day, so it would be one day after March 31st's day.\n\nSo, if I can find out what day March 1st is, I can figure out April 1st.\n\nBut I still need a starting point. Maybe I can assume February 1st is a certain day and see what happens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the number of days between March 1st and April 1st is 31 days.\n\nSo, from March 1st to April 1st is 31 days.\n\nNow, 31 days is equivalent to 4 weeks and 3 days.\n\nSo, the day of the week for April 1st would be 3 days after the day of the week for March 1st.\n\nTherefore, if March 1st is on a Monday, then April 1st would be on a Thursday.\n\nBut I still don't know what day March 1st is.\n\nMaybe I need to look for another approach.\n\nLet me consider that in a non-leap year, like 2011, the calendar repeats every 6 years because 2011 divided by 4 is not an integer, so it's not a leap year.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recall that in 2011, January 1st was on a Saturday.\n\nWait, is that right? I think I might have seen that somewhere.\n\nLet me confirm: January 1st, 2011, was indeed on a Saturday.\n\nOkay, so January 1st, 2011, was a Saturday.\n\nNow, from January 1st to March 1st is 59 days, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, 59 days from Saturday.\n\nNow, 59 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 3 days.\n\nSo, 59 days is equivalent to 8 full weeks plus 3 extra days.\n\nTherefore, March 1st is 3 days after Saturday, which is Tuesday.\n\nSo, March 1st is Tuesday.\n\nNow, from March 1st to April 1st is 31 days.\n\n31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days.\n\nSo, April 1st is 3 days after March 1st's day.\n\nSince March 1st is Tuesday, adding 3 days brings us to Friday.\n\nTherefore, April 1st, 2011, is on a Friday.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wednesday\n\nB. Thursday\n\nC. Friday\n\nD. Saturday\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Friday.\n\nI think that makes sense. I started from January 1st, knew it was a Saturday, calculated the days to March 1st and then to April 1st. It seems logical.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Friday}} \\]"
