                    "text": "Alright, let's see what's going on here. So, there's this homeowner who hired a painter to paint his house for $10,000. But then, the day before the painter was supposed to start, he decided to go on vacation instead. So, the painter called a handyman, who had done some painting work for him before, and asked if he could paint the homeowner's house instead. The painter said that if the handyman does the job, he can keep the $10,000 that the homeowner promised to pay. The handyman agreed to do it.\n\nSo, the next day, the handyman goes to the homeowner's house to start painting. The homeowner wasn't home yet; he had already left for work. So, the handyman starts painting the house. When the homeowner comes home that evening, he sees the handyman painting and is confused. He asks the handyman why he's doing the painting instead of the original painter. The handyman explains that he had an arrangement with the painter to take over the job and keep the $10,000.\n\nBut here's the thing: the homeowner hadn't agreed to this arrangement. He had hired the painter, not the handyman. So, when he found out, he was probably upset that someone else was working on his house without his consent. As a result, he told the handyman to stop working and leave immediately. At that point, the handyman had only completed 50% of the painting job.\n\nNow, the question is: if the handyman decides to sue the homeowner, what are his chances of recovering some payment for the work he's already done? The options are:\n\nA. Recover for unjust enrichment.\n\nB. Recover under the doctrine of substantial performance.\n\nC. Not recover, because his arrangement with the painter was not in writing.\n\nD. Not recover, because there was no contract between the handyman and the homeowner.\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, there was a contract between the homeowner and the painter for $10,000 to paint the house. The painter then tried to pass this job to the handyman, probably without informing the homeowner beforehand. The handyman agreed to do the job in exchange for the $10,000.\n\nBut, when the homeowner found out, he was not happy and told the handyman to stop working. So, the handyman has done half the job but hasn't been paid, and now the homeowner doesn't want to pay because it wasn't the person he hired.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Unjust enrichment: This is a legal doctrine that prevents someone from being unfairly benefited at another's expense. In this case, the homeowner has benefited from half of the painting job done by the handyman, even though he didn't agree to it. So, the handyman might argue that the homeowner should pay him for the work done to avoid being unjustly enriched.\n\nB. Substantial performance: This doctrine allows for partial payment when most of the work has been completed, but there are some minor deficiencies. However, in this scenario, the work was only 50% completed when the homeowner stopped the handyman from continuing. So, it's not clear if that's substantial enough performance to qualify.\n\nC. No recovery because the arrangement with the painter wasn't in writing: This seems to suggest that the agreement between the painter and the handyman might be oral. Depending on the jurisdiction, contracts over a certain amount might need to be in writing (like the Statute of Frauds). If the arrangement wasn't in writing and it's required, that could be a problem for the handyman.\n\nD. No recovery because there was no contract between the handyman and the homeowner: This is an important point. The original contract was between the homeowner and the painter. The handyman was brought in by the painter, but the homeowner never agreed to this substitution. So, from the homeowner's perspective, he had a contract with the painter, not the handyman.\n\nNow, considering all this, I need to figure out which option is most likely to happen if the handyman sues the homeowner.\n\nLet's think about unjust enrichment first. The homeowner has received half of the painting job done by the handyman, which he may consider a benefit. However, he didn't consent to the handyman doing the work, so he might argue that any benefit was unauthorized.\n\nIn some legal systems, if someone does work on your property without your consent, you might not have to pay for it, especially if you didn't request it or agree to it. But, on the other hand, it's not fair for the homeowner to get a free painting job, even if it's only half-done.\n\nSubstantial performance seems less applicable here because the work was only half-done, which might not be considered \"substantial.\" Usually, substantial performance requires that most of the work is completed, with only minor issues remaining.\n\nThe issue of whether the arrangement between the painter and the handyman was in writing is also significant. If their agreement was oral and the law requires contracts over a certain amount to be in writing, then the painter might not be able to enforce the agreement against the handyman. However, this doesn't directly affect the handyman's ability to seek payment from the homeowner.\n\nThe key here is that there was no direct contract between the handyman and the homeowner. The homeowner had a contract with the painter, and the painter tried to assign or delegate the contract to the handyman without the homeowner's consent.\n\nIn general, contracts can be assigned or delegated, but sometimes the consent of the other party is required, especially if the delegation changes the nature of the obligations. In this case, the homeowner might argue that he hired the painter specifically and didn't agree to have someone else do the job.\n\nGiven that, the homeowner might not be liable to the handyman directly for payment. The handyman's recourse might be against the painter for the work he did, but since the painter is presumably the one who promised him the $10,000.\n\nBut, if the handyman sues the homeowner, the homeowner might argue that there was no contract between them, so he doesn't owe the handyman anything. The homeowner might also argue that any benefit he received from the partial painting was unauthorized and that he didn't consent to the arrangement.\n\nHowever, the handyman might argue that the homeowner should pay him for the work done to avoid being unjustly enriched. The homeowner might counter that he already paid the painter, or that he didn't authorize the handyman's work.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, the homeowner hadn't paid anyone yet, as far as I know. The painter was supposed to be paid $10,000 upon completion, but since the job wasn't completed by the painter, it's unclear if the homeowner owes anything.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think about it differently.\n\nPerhaps the painter assigned his rights under the contract to the handyman, meaning that the handyman steps into the shoes of the painter and can enforce the contract against the homeowner.\n\nBut, assignments of contracts typically require that the assignor (the painter) has the right to assign the contract, and sometimes the assignee (the handyman) needs to notify the obligor (the homeowner) of the assignment.\n\nIn this case, the painter assigned his rights to the handyman, but the homeowner wasn't informed or didn't consent to the assignment. So, the assignment might not be valid, and the homeowner might not be bound to pay the handyman.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the painter delegated his duties under the contract to the handyman. Delegation is when one party transfers their duties under a contract to a third party. However, delegation typically doesn't relieve the original obligor from their duties unless the obligee consents.\n\nIn this case, the painter delegated his painting duties to the handyman but didn't get the homeowner's consent. So, the painter would still be responsible for the performance of the contract, and the homeowner might not be obligated to pay the handyman.\n\nGiven all that, it seems that the handyman might have a tough time recovering payment directly from the homeowner.\n\nBut, what about the doctrine of quantum meruit, which allows recovery for the reasonable value of services rendered in the absence of a contract? Maybe that's similar to unjust enrichment.\n\nQuantum meruit is a principle where a person who has conferred a benefit on another is entitled to be compensated for the reasonable value of the benefit, even if there was no express contract.\n\nIn this case, the handyman conferred a benefit on the homeowner by painting half of the house. The homeowner might have received that benefit, but he didn't consent to it. So, whether the homeowner has to pay for it depends on whether he was unjustly enriched by the partial painting.\n\nSome courts might say that since the homeowner didn't consent to the arrangement, he shouldn't have to pay for the work done by the handyman. Others might say that he should pay for the benefit he received, even if he didn't consent to it.\n\nThis seems similar to the unjust enrichment argument.\n\nGiven that, I think option A, recovering for unjust enrichment, is a possible outcome.\n\nOption B, substantial performance, seems less applicable because only half of the job was done, which might not be considered substantial enough.\n\nOption C mentions that the arrangement with the painter wasn't in writing, which might be a problem for the painter and the handyman's agreement, but it doesn't directly affect the handyman's ability to seek payment from the homeowner.\n\nOption D says that the handyman won't recover because there was no contract between them and the homeowner, which is also a valid point.\n\nBut, considering that the handyman did perform some work that benefited the homeowner, even without a direct contract, the homeowner might still be required to pay for the value of the work done to avoid being unjustly enriched.\n\nSo, between options A and D, I think A is more likely, as the homeowner might have to pay for the benefit he received, even if it was unauthorized.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. recover for unjust enrichment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
