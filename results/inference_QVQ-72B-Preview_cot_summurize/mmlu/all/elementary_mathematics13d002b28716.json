                    "text": "So I have this number, 4.95, and I need to write it as a mixed number or a fraction in its simplest form. The options are:\n\nA. 4 and 19 over 20\n\nB. 4 and 19 over 100\n\nC. 4 and 1 over 20\n\nD. 419 over 1000\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what a mixed number is. A mixed number is like a combination of a whole number and a fraction. So, for 4.95, the whole number part is 4, and the decimal part is 0.95.\n\nSo, the mixed number would be 4 and something over something. Now, I need to figure out what fraction 0.95 is when expressed as a fraction in simplest form.\n\nI know that decimals can be turned into fractions by considering the place value. The decimal 0.95 has two digits after the decimal point, so it's 95 hundredths. That means 0.95 is equal to 95/100.\n\nSo, the mixed number would be 4 and 95/100. But that's not in simplest form. I need to simplify the fraction part, which is 95/100.\n\nTo simplify a fraction, I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by that number.\n\nWhat's the GCD of 95 and 100? Let's see.\n\nThe factors of 95 are 1, 5, 19, and 95.\n\nThe factors of 100 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, and 100.\n\nThe common factors are 1 and 5. So, the greatest common divisor is 5.\n\nNow, I divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5.\n\n95 \u00f7 5 = 19\n\n100 \u00f7 5 = 20\n\nSo, 95/100 simplifies to 19/20.\n\nTherefore, the mixed number in simplest form for 4.95 is 4 and 19 over 20.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 4 and 19 over 20\n\nB. 4 and 19 over 100\n\nC. 4 and 1 over 20\n\nD. 419 over 1000\n\nOption A matches my answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the entire decimal into a improper fraction.\n\n4.95 can be written as 4 + 0.95.\n\nNow, 4 is 4/1, and 0.95 is 95/100.\n\nSo, adding them together: 4/1 + 95/100.\n\nTo add these, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 1 and 100. The least common denominator (LCD) is 100.\n\nSo, 4/1 is equal to 400/100.\n\nThen, 400/100 + 95/100 = 495/100.\n\nNow, 495/100 can be converted back to a mixed number.\n\n495 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 95, so 4 and 95/100, which simplifies to 4 and 19/20.\n\nAgain, this confirms that the correct answer is option A.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nCould 4.95 be interpreted as 4 and 1 over 20? That would be 4.05, not 4.95. So, no.\n\nOption C is 4 and 1 over 20, which is 4.05, not 4.95.\n\nOption B is 4 and 19 over 100, which is 4.19, not 4.95.\n\nOption D is 419 over 1000, which is 0.419, not 4.95.\n\nSo, clearly, option A is the correct choice.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the place value of each digit in 4.95.\n\nThe 4 is in the ones place, the 9 is in the hundredths place, and the 5 is in the thousandths place.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in the decimal 4.95, the 4 is in the ones place, the 9 is in the tenths place, and the 5 is in the hundredths place.\n\nSo, 4.95 is 4 + 9/10 + 5/100.\n\nBut perhaps that's not the most straightforward way to approach it.\n\nAlternatively, I could write 4.95 as 495/100, since the decimal extends to the hundredths place.\n\nThen, 495/100 is the same as 4 and 95/100, which simplifies to 4 and 19/20.\n\nAgain, this reinforces that option A is correct.\n\nMaybe I should also consider the context of the question. It asks for the simplest form, which I believe I've achieved by simplifying 95/100 to 19/20.\n\nIs there any chance that 19/20 can be simplified further? Well, 19 is a prime number, so no.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is option A: 4 and 19 over 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 4 \\dfrac{19}{20}} \\]"
