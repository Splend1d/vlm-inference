                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about suppressing a defendant's statement in a criminal case. The scenario is that the defendant was arrested for armed robbery of a liquor store, taken directly to the police station in a patrol car, and then waited about an hour in an interview room before a detective came in. The detective gave the defendant his Miranda warnings, and the defendant agreed to waive his rights and speak to the detective, resulting in a confession.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of the following allegations would be LEAST helpful in suppressing his statement. So, I need to think about each option and determine which one is the weakest or least likely to lead to the suppression of the defendant's confession.\n\nLet's look at option A: \"Before the defendant gave the statement he was refused permission to use the bathroom.\"\n\nHmm, this seems like it might be relevant to the defendant's well-being and possibly to whether his statement was voluntary. If the defendant was in discomfort or distress because he wasn't allowed to use the bathroom, that could affect the voluntariness of his confession. Involuntary statements can be suppressed. So, this might be a ground to suppress the statement.\n\nMoving on to option B: \"The defendant had a private lawyer on retainer at the time he gave his statement.\"\n\nThis is interesting. If the defendant had a private lawyer on retainer, that might imply that he should have had access to that lawyer before giving a statement. Miranda warnings include the right to have an attorney present during questioning, and if the defendant had a lawyer already, the police might be obligated to ensure that lawyer was present or at least that the defendant had the opportunity to contact them. If that didn't happen, it could be a violation of his Miranda rights, which could lead to suppressing the statement.\n\nOption C: \"The defendant's arrest was not based on probable cause.\"\n\nThis one is about the legality of the arrest itself. If the arrest was without probable cause, it could be considered unlawful. However, the connection between the legality of the arrest and the admissibility of a subsequent confession is not straightforward. There might be some arguments that an unlawful arrest taints the confession, but it's generally accepted that even if an arrest is unlawful, a voluntary confession obtained after proper Miranda warnings can still be admissible. So, this might not be as helpful in suppressing the statement compared to other options.\n\nOption D: \"The defendant could not speak English, and the warnings were given in English.\"\n\nThis is a significant issue. If the defendant did not speak English and the Miranda warnings were given in English, it's likely that the defendant did not understand his rights. For a waiver of Miranda rights to be valid, it must be knowing and voluntary, which includes understanding the rights being waived. If the defendant didn't understand the warnings because they were in a language he didn't speak, then his waiver wouldn't be valid, and the statement could be suppressed.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, let's see:\n\n- Option A suggests the defendant was refused permission to use the bathroom, which could affect the voluntariness of the statement.\n\n- Option B indicates the defendant had a private lawyer on retainer, which could imply a Miranda violation if the lawyer wasn't present or consulted before the statement.\n\n- Option C states that the arrest was not based on probable cause, which might not directly lead to suppressing the statement.\n\n- Option D says the defendant couldn't speak English, but the warnings were given in English, which could invalidate the waiver of Miranda rights.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C seems the least helpful in suppressing the statement because, while an arrest without probable cause is problematic, it's not directly linked to the voluntariness or the Miranda compliance regarding the statement. The other options point to more direct issues with the process of giving the statement.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. The defendant's arrest was not based on probable cause.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
