                    "text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about Dawn Corp. and their labor variances. They have both an unfavorable labor rate variance and an unfavorable labor efficiency variance. Initially, they wrote these variances off directly to cost of goods sold. But the question is asking what would happen to the current ratio and net income if they had allocated these variances to work in process, finished goods, and cost of goods sold instead.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these variances mean. A labor rate variance is the difference between the actual labor cost and the standard labor cost based on the actual hours worked and the standard rate. An unfavorable variance means that the actual labor cost was higher than the standard cost.\n\nSimilarly, a labor efficiency variance is the difference between the actual hours worked and the standard hours that should have been worked for the actual output, multiplied by the standard rate. An unfavorable efficiency variance means that more hours were worked than the standard allowed for the actual output.\n\nSo, both variances are unfavorable, meaning that Dawn Corp. spent more on labor than they had planned.\n\nNow, they initially wrote off these variances directly to cost of goods sold. That means that the variances increased the cost of goods sold, which in turn would decrease gross profit and net income.\n\nBut the question is asking what would happen if they had allocated these variances to work in process, finished goods, and cost of goods sold instead.\n\nI think this means that instead of writing off the variances entirely to cost of goods sold, they would prorate the variances across the three inventory accounts: work in process, finished goods, and cost of goods sold.\n\nIn a standard cost system, variances can be disposed of in different ways. One common method is to close the variances to cost of goods sold, which effectively adjusts the actual cost to standard cost in the income statement. Alternatively, the variances can be allocated to the inventory accounts and cost of goods sold based on some allocation basis, like the standard cost in each account.\n\nIf Dawn Corp. had chosen to allocate the variances to work in process, finished goods, and cost of goods sold, it would mean that part of the variance would be absorbed by the inventory and part would go to cost of goods sold.\n\nThis would affect the cost of goods sold and, consequently, net income differently compared to writing off the variances entirely to cost of goods sold.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, if the variances are allocated to work in process and finished goods, these accounts would be adjusted upwards because the variances are unfavorable. That means the inventory costs would be higher than they would be under standard costs.\n\nSince inventory is an asset on the balance sheet, increasing the inventory values would increase total assets.\n\nNow, the cost of goods sold would also be adjusted, but not by the full amount of the variances, because some of the variances are being allocated to inventory.\n\nSo, if the variances are allocated to inventory, cost of goods sold would be increased by a lesser amount compared to writing off the variances entirely to cost of goods sold.\n\nThis would mean that net income would be higher if the variances are allocated to inventory, because cost of goods sold is lower.\n\nWait, but the variances are unfavorable, so allocating them to inventory would increase the inventory costs, which is like saying that the company has more cost tied up in inventory due to inefficiencies.\n\nBut in terms of net income, since not all the variance is going to cost of goods sold, net income would be higher compared to writing off the entire variance to cost of goods sold.\n\nSo, net income would increase.\n\nNow, what about the current ratio?\n\nThe current ratio is current assets divided by current liabilities.\n\nIf allocating the variances to inventory increases inventory values, which is a current asset, then total current assets would increase.\n\nAssuming current liabilities remain unchanged, an increase in current assets would lead to an increase in the current ratio.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm whether inventory is a current asset. Yes, inventory is typically considered a current asset because it's expected to be sold within one year.\n\nSo, if allocating the variances to inventory increases inventory values, current assets increase, and thus the current ratio increases.\n\nTherefore, both net income and the current ratio would increase if Dawn Corp. allocated the variances to work in process, finished goods, and cost of goods sold instead of writing them off directly to cost of goods sold.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Increases Increases\n\nB. Increases Decreases\n\nC. Decreases Increases\n\nD. Decreases Decreases\n\nOption A seems to be the correct answer: both current ratio and net income increase.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the alternative: writing off the variances directly to cost of goods sold.\n\nIn this case, the full amount of the unfavorable variances would be added to cost of goods sold, reducing gross profit and net income.\n\nIf instead, the variances are allocated to inventory accounts and cost of goods sold, part of the variance would be capitalized in inventory, and only a portion would go to cost of goods sold.\n\nThis would mean that cost of goods sold increases by less, leading to a higher net income.\n\nAdditionally, since inventory values are increased, current assets increase, leading to a higher current ratio.\n\nTherefore, yes, both net income and the current ratio would increase by choosing to allocate the variances to work in process, finished goods, and cost of goods sold rather than writing them off directly to cost of goods sold.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Increases Increases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
