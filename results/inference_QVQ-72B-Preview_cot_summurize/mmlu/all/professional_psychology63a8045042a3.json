                    "text": "So I've got this question here about power in the workplace. The supervisor says, \"My position gives me a great deal of authority, my subordinates know that I expect that my orders will be followed.\" And I need to figure out which type of power this refers to from the options: expert power, legitimate power, reward power, or referent power.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each type of power means in this context. I remember learning about different bases of power in organizational behavior. There are five main types: legitimate power, reward power, coercive power, expert power, and referent power. Since coercive power isn't listed here, I can focus on the other four.\n\nLet's start with legitimate power. I think this is about having authority because of your position in the organization. So, if someone has legitimate power, it's because they hold a certain role or title that gives them the right to make decisions and expect others to comply. It's like, \"I'm the boss, so you have to do what I say.\"\n\nReward power is different. This is when someone can influence others because they can give rewards or benefits. For example, a manager might say, \"If you do this, I'll give you a bonus or a promotion.\" It's about the ability to provide positive incentives.\n\nExpert power is based on knowledge or expertise. If someone has special skills or knowledge that others need, they can influence others with that. For instance, a team might listen to a particular member because they're the expert in a certain area.\n\nReferent power is about identification or liking. If people admire or like someone, they might want to do what that person wants or follows their lead. It's about building relationships and being a role model.\n\nNow, looking back at the supervisor's statement: \"My position gives me a great deal of authority, my subordinates know that I expect that my orders will be followed.\"\n\nThis seems to be emphasizing the position or role the supervisor holds. They're saying that their authority comes from their position, and subordinates are expected to follow orders because of that position. It doesn't sound like they're talking about rewards they can give, or their expert knowledge, or their personal relationships with subordinates.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like legitimate power is the most fitting here. Legitimate power is all about the formal authority that comes with a position in the organization.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a trick here.\n\nIs there any chance that this could be interpreted as expert power? Well, if the supervisor has a lot of expertise and subordinates follow orders because they respect that expertise, then maybe. But the statement specifically mentions that it's the position that gives them authority, not their personal expertise.\n\nSimilarly, with reward power, if the supervisor can offer rewards for compliance, that might be a factor. But again, the statement is more about the authority derived from the position itself, not about the ability to give rewards.\n\nReferent power would involve subordinates following the supervisor because they like or admire them personally. But the statement doesn't suggest anything about personal relationships or admiration.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward interpretation is that this is an example of legitimate power.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's a combination of powers at play here. For example, perhaps the supervisor has both legitimate power and expert power, but in this particular statement, they're focusing on the legitimate aspect.\n\nHowever, based on the options provided and the wording of the question, it seems clear that legitimate power is the primary type being referred to here.\n\nSo, my answer is B. legitimate power.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
