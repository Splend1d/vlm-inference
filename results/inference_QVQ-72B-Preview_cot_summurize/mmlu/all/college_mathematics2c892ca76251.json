                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that X is a finite set, and the number of subsets with exactly 3 elements is 14 more than the number of subsets with exactly 2 elements. And I need to find out how many subsets have exactly 4 elements.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basics about subsets and combinations. If X has n elements, then the number of subsets with exactly k elements is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!).\n\nSo, let's denote the number of elements in X as n. Then, the number of subsets with exactly 3 elements is C(n, 3), and the number of subsets with exactly 2 elements is C(n, 2).\n\nAccording to the problem, C(n, 3) = C(n, 2) + 14.\n\nI need to find C(n, 4), which is the number of subsets with exactly 4 elements.\n\nAlright, so my first task is to find n, the number of elements in X, given the relationship between C(n, 3) and C(n, 2).\n\nLet me write down the equations:\n\nC(n, 3) = C(n, 2) + 14\n\nWhich means:\n\nn! / (3!(n - 3)!) = n! / (2!(n - 2)!) + 14\n\nHmm, that looks a bit messy. Maybe I can simplify it.\n\nLet me recall that C(n, k) = C(n, n - k), but that might not help directly here.\n\nAlternatively, I know that C(n, 2) = n(n - 1)/2 and C(n, 3) = n(n - 1)(n - 2)/6.\n\nSo plugging these into the equation:\n\nn(n - 1)(n - 2)/6 = n(n - 1)/2 + 14\n\nMaybe I can solve for n.\n\nFirst, let's multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate denominators:\n\nn(n - 1)(n - 2) = 3n(n - 1) + 84\n\nExpand the left side:\n\nn(n - 1)(n - 2) = n(n^2 - 3n + 2) = n^3 - 3n^2 + 2n\n\nAnd the right side:\n\n3n(n - 1) = 3n^2 - 3n\n\nSo:\n\nn^3 - 3n^2 + 2n = 3n^2 - 3n + 84\n\nLet's bring all terms to one side:\n\nn^3 - 3n^2 + 2n - 3n^2 + 3n - 84 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nn^3 - 6n^2 + 5n - 84 = 0\n\nHmm, now I have a cubic equation to solve for n.\n\nI need to find integer values of n that satisfy this equation, since n represents the number of elements in a set.\n\nMaybe I can try plugging in some integer values for n to see which one works.\n\nLet's try n = 7:\n\n7^3 - 6*7^2 + 5*7 - 84 = 343 - 294 + 35 - 84 = 0\n\nWow, that works! So n = 7 is a solution.\n\nAlright, so the set X has 7 elements.\n\nNow, I need to find C(7, 4), which is the number of subsets with exactly 4 elements.\n\nC(7, 4) = 7! / (4!3!) = (7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4!) / (4! \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 35\n\nSo, there are 35 subsets with exactly 4 elements.\n\nWait a minute, but looking at the options:\n\nA. 24\n\nB. 25\n\nC. 28\n\nD. 35\n\nSo, 35 is one of the options. But let's double-check if there are any other possible values of n that satisfy the original equation.\n\nI mean, is n = 7 the only integer solution to the equation n^3 - 6n^2 + 5n - 84 = 0?\n\nLet me check for n = 6:\n\n6^3 - 6*6^2 + 5*6 - 84 = 216 - 216 + 30 - 84 = -64 \u2260 0\n\nn = 8:\n\n8^3 - 6*8^2 + 5*8 - 84 = 512 - 384 + 40 - 84 = 84 \u2260 0\n\nn = 5:\n\n5^3 - 6*5^2 + 5*5 - 84 = 125 - 150 + 25 - 84 = -84 \u2260 0\n\nn = 4:\n\n4^3 - 6*4^2 + 5*4 - 84 = 64 - 96 + 20 - 84 = -96 \u2260 0\n\nn = 8 again: 512 - 384 + 40 - 84 = 84 \u2260 0\n\nn = 9:\n\n9^3 - 6*9^2 + 5*9 - 84 = 729 - 486 + 45 - 84 = 198 \u2260 0\n\nn = 10:\n\n10^3 - 6*10^2 + 5*10 - 84 = 1000 - 600 + 50 - 84 = 366 \u2260 0\n\nIt seems like n = 7 is the only integer solution in a reasonable range.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are negative values or fractions, but since n represents the number of elements in a set, it has to be a positive integer.\n\nSo, n = 7 is the only valid solution, and C(7, 4) = 35.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 35.\n\nBut wait, let's see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe without solving the cubic equation.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the identity involving combinations.\n\nI recall that C(n, k) = C(n, n - k).\n\nSo, C(n, 3) = C(n, 4), and C(n, 2) = C(n, 4).\n\nWait, no, C(n, 3) = C(n, 4) only when n = 7, as we've found.\n\nBut in this problem, C(n, 3) = C(n, 2) + 14.\n\nIs there a relationship or identity that can help me here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express C(n, 3) and C(n, 2) in terms of n and set up the equation.\n\nWait, I already did that earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that C(n, 3) - C(n, 2) = 14.\n\nSo, C(n, 3) - C(n, 2) = [n(n - 1)(n - 2)/6] - [n(n - 1)/2] = 14\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n[n(n - 1)(n - 2) - 3n(n - 1)] / 6 = 14\n\nFactor n(n - 1):\n\nn(n - 1)[(n - 2) - 3]/6 = 14\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n(n - 2) - 3 = n - 5\n\nSo, n(n - 1)(n - 5)/6 = 14\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 6:\n\nn(n - 1)(n - 5) = 84\n\nNow, I need to find integer n such that n(n - 1)(n - 5) = 84\n\nLet me try n = 7:\n\n7*6*2 = 84 \u2192 yes!\n\nn = 6:\n\n6*5*(-1) = -30 \u2260 84\n\nn = 8:\n\n8*7*3 = 168 \u2260 84\n\nn = 9:\n\n9*8*4 = 288 \u2260 84\n\nn = 5:\n\n5*4*0 = 0 \u2260 84\n\nn = 4:\n\n4*3*(-1) = -12 \u2260 84\n\nn = 10:\n\n10*9*5 = 450 \u2260 84\n\nAgain, n = 7 is the only positive integer solution in a reasonable range.\n\nTherefore, the set X has 7 elements, and the number of subsets with exactly 4 elements is C(7, 4) = 35.\n\nSo, the answer is D. 35.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{35} \\]"
