                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about an attorney and a client, and there's some confusion about whether a contract was formed between them. The attorney received a document from the client with a note asking if a certain contract for the sale of a boat complies with state law. The client mentions that she's out of town and will be back next week. The attorney reviews the document, writes a one-page letter saying it complies with state law, and includes a bill for $500, which is a reasonable fee. But then the client refuses to pay, saying she never agreed to retain the attorney and that since the sale transaction wasn't concluded, she didn't get anything of value from the attorney.\n\nNow, the question is whether the attorney can successfully sue the client for the $500. There are four options:\n\nA. No, because even if the parties had an agreement, that agreement was discharged under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.\n\nB. No, because the attorney and the client never agreed on the essential terms of a contract.\n\nC. Yes, because the attorney took action on the client's note to his detriment.\n\nD. Yes, because the client's note and the attorney's performance created an implied-in-fact contract.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand if there was a contract formed between the attorney and the client. A contract generally requires an offer, an acceptance, consideration, and mutual assent.\n\nThe client sent a note asking the attorney to review a document and opine on whether it complies with state law. The attorney did the work and provided the opinion in a letter, along with a bill for $500.\n\nNow, was there an offer and acceptance here? The client's note seems like a request for services, and the attorney's action of reviewing the document and providing the letter could be seen as acceptance of that request. But is that enough to form a contract?\n\nOption A suggests that even if there was an agreement, it was discharged due to frustration of purpose. Frustration of purpose occurs when an unforeseen event makes the contract's performance impossible or radically changes the parties' obligations or rights. In this case, the client says the sale transaction wasn't concluded, so perhaps she feels that the purpose of the contract (reviewing the sales contract) is now frustrated. However, the attorney already performed the service, and the fee is separate from the outcome of the sale. So, I'm not sure if frustration of purpose applies here. Maybe not the strongest argument.\n\nOption B says no because they never agreed on essential terms. Essential terms typically include the scope of work and the fee. The client asked for a review of the contract, and the attorney provided a letter stating it complies with state law and billed $500. The client didn't specify a fee, but the attorney set the fee. Maybe there was no explicit agreement on the fee, but $500 seems reasonable, as stated. So, perhaps there's some ambiguity there, but generally, if the service is performed and a reasonable fee is charged, that might be acceptable.\n\nOption C says yes because the attorney acted to his detriment based on the client's note. This sounds a bit like promissory estoppel, where one party relies on the promise or request of another to their detriment. Here, the attorney relied on the client's request to review the document and provided the service, expecting payment. If the client now refuses to pay, the attorney has been harmed (i.e., provided services without compensation). So, this could be a possible ground for recovery.\n\nOption D says yes because there's an implied-in-fact contract based on the client's note and the attorney's performance. An implied-in-fact contract is one where the terms are not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the parties' conduct and the surrounding circumstances. In this case, the client requested services, the attorney provided them, and a fee was stated. This seems plausible.\n\nNow, considering these options, I need to decide which one is most likely correct.\n\nFirst, regarding option A, frustration of purpose seems unlikely because the attorney has already performed the service, and the client's inability to complete the sale doesn't negate the value of the service provided. The attorney's work had value regardless of whether the sale went through.\n\nOption B suggests there was no agreement on essential terms. While it's true that the client didn't specify a fee, the attorney provided a fee and deemed it reasonable. In many professions, including law, if a client requests services without specifying a fee, the professional can charge a reasonable fee. So, perhaps there was an implied agreement on a reasonable fee.\n\nOption C, promissory estoppel, is a possible theory. The attorney relied on the client's request and provided services, expecting payment. If the client now reneges, the attorney can argue that it's unfair and should be compensated for the services rendered.\n\nOption D, an implied-in-fact contract, seems particularly strong here. The client's note can be seen as an implied request for services, and the attorney's action of providing the letter and the bill can be seen as acceptance and performance of that request. The fact that the attorney provided a specific fee ($500) and the client didn't object to the scope of work suggests that there was an understanding, even if not explicitly contracted.\n\nAdditionally, in professional service contexts, especially between attorneys and clients, it's common for clients to request services via notes or emails without formal contracts, with the understanding that they will be billed for the services provided at standard rates.\n\nMoreover, the client's statement that she would have discussed it in person but was out of town implies a pre-existing relationship or at least an expectation that the attorney would provide the service in good faith.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the attorney has a strong case based on either promissory estoppel or an implied-in-fact contract.\n\nBetween options C and D, option D seems more directly applicable because it specifically refers to an implied-in-fact contract, which is a recognized legal doctrine for finding contractual obligations even without explicit terms.\n\nOption C, promissory estoppel, is another valid approach, but in this context, an implied-in-fact contract might be a stronger argument because there is a clear exchange of services for payment.\n\nFurthermore, in many jurisdictions, when a client requests services from a professional and the professional provides those services with a stated fee, it's often sufficient to establish an implied contract.\n\nTherefore, I would conclude that the attorney is likely to prevail in suing the client for the $500 based on the implied-in-fact contract created by the client's note and the attorney's performance of the requested services.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. Yes, because the client's note and the attorney's performance created an implied-in-fact contract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
