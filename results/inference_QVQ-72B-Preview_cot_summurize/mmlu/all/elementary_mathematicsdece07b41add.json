                    "text": "So Lily has a bag of candy, and she wants to give it all away equally to either 5, 3, or 2 people. That means the total number of candies in the bag should be divisible by 5, by 3, and by 2. Because if it's divisible by these numbers, she can split them evenly without any candy left over.\n\nSo, I need to find a number that is a multiple of 5, 3, and 2. That sounds like finding the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. But since the options given are specific numbers, I can check which one of them is divisible by 5, 3, and 2.\n\nLet's list out the options:\n\nA. 12\n\nB. 20\n\nC. 30\n\nD. 45\n\nI need to check each one to see if it's divisible by 5, 3, and 2.\n\nFirst, check 12:\n\n- 12 \u00f7 5 = 2.4, which is not a whole number. So, not divisible by 5.\n\n- 12 \u00f7 3 = 4, which is good.\n\n- 12 \u00f7 2 = 6, which is good.\n\nBut since it's not divisible by 5, 12 is not the answer.\n\nNext, 20:\n\n- 20 \u00f7 5 = 4, which is good.\n\n- 20 \u00f7 3 = approximately 6.666..., which is not a whole number.\n\n- 20 \u00f7 2 = 10, which is good.\n\nSo, 20 is not divisible by 3, so it's out.\n\nNow, 30:\n\n- 30 \u00f7 5 = 6, which is good.\n\n- 30 \u00f7 3 = 10, which is good.\n\n- 30 \u00f7 2 = 15, which is good.\n\nSo, 30 is divisible by 5, 3, and 2. This seems to fit the criteria.\n\nLastly, 45:\n\n- 45 \u00f7 5 = 9, which is good.\n\n- 45 \u00f7 3 = 15, which is good.\n\n- 45 \u00f7 2 = 22.5, which is not a whole number.\n\nSo, 45 is not divisible by 2, so it's out.\n\nTherefore, the only number among the options that is divisible by 5, 3, and 2 is 30.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should think about the LCM of 5, 3, and 2. Let's find the LCM.\n\nPrime factors:\n\n- 5 is prime.\n\n- 3 is prime.\n\n- 2 is prime.\n\nThe LCM would be the product of the highest powers of the prime factors, which in this case is 5 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 = 30.\n\nSo, the smallest number that is divisible by 5, 3, and 2 is 30. Since 30 is one of the options, it fits perfectly.\n\nI don't think the number of candies has to be larger than 30 because 30 is already a multiple of 5, 3, and 2. Unless there's a reason to think that the bag has more candies, but based on the options given, 30 seems suitable.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider multiples of 30, like 60, 90, etc., they would also fit, but those aren't among the options. So, among the given options, 30 is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"which number of pieces of candy could be in Lily's bag?\" It doesn't say that it has to be the smallest number. So, theoretically, any multiple of the LCM of 5, 3, and 2 would work, but among the options provided, only 30 fits the criteria.\n\nTo reiterate, the LCM of 5, 3, and 2 is 30, so 30 is divisible by all three numbers. The other options don't meet all the criteria.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
