                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"The term 'sociology' was coined in the early 1800s by which of the following? A. Auguste Comte, B. Robert K. Merton, C. Karl Marx, D. Emile Durkheim.\" Hmm, I need to figure out who first came up with the term \"sociology.\" Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that sociology is the study of society and social behavior. It's a social science that looks at how people interact with one another and how societies function. But when was the term first used, and by whom?\n\nLet me recall what I learned in my introductory sociology class. I think the term \"sociology\" was coined in the 19th century. The options given are Auguste Comte, Robert K. Merton, Karl Marx, and Emile Durkheim. All of these are famous figures in sociology, but I don't think they all lived in the early 1800s.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Auguste Comte. I remember that he is often referred to as the \"father of sociology.\" He was a French philosopher and social theorist who lived from 1798 to 1857. That places him in the early to mid-19th century. I think he coined the term \"sociology\" in the 1830s or something like that. Let me see if that's accurate.\n\nI found that Auguste Comte first used the term \"sociology\" in 1838 in his work \"Cours de Philosophie Positive.\" So that would make him the one who coined the term. But just to be sure, let's check the other options.\n\nRobert K. Merton: He was an American sociologist who lived from 1910 to 2003. That's clearly later than the early 1800s. He is known for his work on social theory and research methods, but he didn't coin the term sociology. So, probably not the answer.\n\nKarl Marx: He was a German philosopher, economist, and revolutionary socialist who lived from 1818 to 1883. He is famous for his theories on class struggle and the foundations of capitalism. While he made significant contributions to sociology, especially in the areas of social stratification and economic systems, I don't recall him coining the term \"sociology.\"\n\nEmile Durkheim: He was a French sociologist who lived from 1858 to 1917. He is known for his work on social facts and the function of society. Durkheim is considered one of the founders of functionalism in sociology. However, I think he came after Comte in terms of coining the term \"sociology.\"\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that Auguste Comte was the one who first used the term \"sociology\" in the early 1800s, specifically in 1838. Let me just double-check this information to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nUpon further checking, I found that Auguste Comte indeed coined the term \"sociology\" in 1838. He derived it from the Greek word \"socius\" meaning \"companion\" and the Latin word \"logia\" meaning \"study of.\" So, the term \"sociology\" literally means the study of companionship or social bonds.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer to the question should be A. Auguste Comte.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that another sociologist might have used the term earlier. For instance, was there anyone before Comte who used the term \"sociology\"?\n\nI did some research and couldn't find any evidence of the term \"sociology\" being used before Comte. In fact, Comte is widely recognized for creating this term to describe the study of society and social behavior.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that Auguste Comte coined the term \"sociology\" in the early 1800s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Auguste Comte}} \\]"
