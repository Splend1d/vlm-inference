                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand the Engle-Granger test, especially when it's applied to the residuals of a potentially cointegrating regression. The question is about the null hypothesis in this context. Let me see what each option means.\n\nOption A says that the variables are cointegrated. So, if the null hypothesis is that the variables are cointegrated, that would mean we're starting with the assumption that there is a long-term equilibrium relationship between the variables.\n\nOption B says that the variables are not cointegrated. This would mean that there is no long-term equilibrium relationship between the variables.\n\nOption C says that both variables are stationary. Stationarity means that the statistical properties of a time series are constant over time, like mean and variance don't change.\n\nOption D says that both variables are non-stationary. Non-stationary means the opposite; the statistical properties change over time.\n\nNow, from what I recall, the Engle-Granger test is used to test for cointegration between non-stationary variables. The idea is that even if variables are non-stationary on their own, they might have a long-term relationship that makes their linear combination stationary.\n\nSo, in the Engle-Granger two-step method, the first step is to run a regression between the variables, say Y and X, and get the residuals, which represent the deviation from the long-term relationship.\n\nThe second step is to test these residuals for stationarity using a unit root test, like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. The null hypothesis of the ADF test is that the residuals have a unit root, meaning they are non-stationary.\n\nTherefore, in the context of the Engle-Granger test, the null hypothesis is that the residuals are non-stationary, which implies that there is no cointegration between the variables. So, if we fail to reject the null hypothesis, we conclude that the variables are not cointegrated.\n\nWait a minute, but option B says \"the variables are not cointegrated,\" which seems to align with this. So, the null hypothesis is that there is no cointegration, which matches option B.\n\nBut let's double-check. If the residuals are stationary, that would mean that the variables share a common stochastic trend and are cointegrated. So, rejecting the null hypothesis of non-stationary residuals would lead us to conclude that the variables are cointegrated.\n\nTherefore, the null hypothesis is that the variables are not cointegrated, which corresponds to option B.\n\nI think that's the correct interpretation. So, the answer should be option B: the variables are not cointegrated.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
