                    "text": "So I have this question about GDP classification, and I need to figure out which option falls under the category \"C\" when calculating GDP. The options are:\n\nA. A homeowner mowing her own lawn\n\nB. $50.00 spent eating out at a restaurant\n\nC. The purchase of new computer software by an accounting firm\n\nD. Flour purchased by a baker to make donuts\n\nFirst, I need to recall what \"C\" stands for in the context of GDP. I remember that GDP is calculated using the expenditure approach, which breaks down spending into different components: Consumption (C), Investment (I), Government Spending (G), and Net Exports (X - M).\n\nSo, Consumption (C) typically includes spending by households on goods and services. That would include things like buying food, clothing, entertainment, and so on.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: A homeowner mowing her own lawn.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit tricky. If someone is mowing their own lawn, they're providing a service to themselves, but in GDP terms, it's generally not counted as consumption because it's self-provided. Maybe it's considered a part of household production, which isn't typically included in GDP calculations. So, probably not C.\n\nOption B: $50.00 spent eating out at a restaurant.\n\nThis sounds like a clear-cut case of consumption. Eating out is a service provided by the restaurant, and when individuals spend money on it, it's part of household consumption. So, this seems like it should be classified under C.\n\nOption C: The purchase of new computer software by an accounting firm.\n\nNow, this is a bit more complex. An accounting firm buying new software could be considered an investment in capital goods, which would fall under Investment (I), not Consumption (C). Businesses often purchase software to improve their operations, and such expenditures are typically treated as investments in economic terms.\n\nOption D: Flour purchased by a baker to make donuts.\n\nThis seems like an intermediate good. Flour is used by the baker to produce donuts, which are then sold to consumers. In GDP calculations, the value of final goods and services is what counts, not the intermediate goods. So, the flour is part of the cost of producing donuts, and its value is already included in the price of the donuts when they are sold. Therefore, the flour purchase itself isn't directly part of Consumption (C).\n\nBased on this analysis, it seems that Option B, spending $50.00 eating out at a restaurant, is the one that should be classified under Consumption (C) when calculating GDP.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nIn macroeconomics, consumption expenditures include spending on durable goods (like appliances), nondurable goods (like food and clothing), and services (like haircuts, medical care, and restaurant meals). So, eating out definitely falls under services consumed by households.\n\nOn the other hand, the other options seem to fit into different categories:\n\n- Option A: Probably not counted as consumption because it's self-provided labor.\n\n- Option C: Likely an investment by the accounting firm, as it's a purchase of software intended to enhance productivity.\n\n- Option D: An intermediate good purchased by a business for production purposes, which would be part of the cost of producing final goods.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that Option B is the correct choice for Consumption (C) in GDP calculations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
