                    "text": "So I have this question about frameshift mutations, and I need to figure out which option represents a frameshift mutation. The question gives the sequence \"CAT HAS HIS\" and four possible changes to it. I need to pick the one that's a frameshift mutation.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a frameshift mutation is. From what I remember in biology class, a frameshift mutation occurs when the reading frame of a gene's DNA sequence is altered. This usually happens due to the insertion or deletion of bases in the DNA that are not multiples of three. Since genes are read in codons, which are three bases each, shifting the reading frame can really mess up the meaning of the genetic code from that point onward.\n\nIn the context of this question, the sequence \"CAT HAS HIS\" is probably representing a simplified version of a genetic code. Maybe each word represents a codon or something similar. Normally, DNA is read in triplets, so in this case, \"CAT\" could be one codon, \"HAS\" another, and \"HIS\" a third one.\n\nNow, a frameshift mutation would involve either adding or removing letters in such a way that the grouping of the triplets changes. So, if we have \"CAT HAS HIS\" and we insert or delete letters not in multiples of three, it should change how the triplets are read.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HAS HIT\n\nHere, the last \"S\" in \"HIS\" is changed to \"T\", so it's a substitution of one letter. This doesn't seem like a frameshift; it's more like a point mutation where one base is replaced by another. The grouping of the triplets remains the same: \"CAT\" \"HAS\" \"HIT\".\n\nB. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HSH ISA\n\nIn this one, there's an insertion of an \"I\" after \"HSH\", making it \"HSH ISA\". So, the sequence becomes \"CAT\" \"HSH\" \"ISA\". Comparing to the original \"CAT\" \"HAS\" \"HIS\", it looks like an extra letter has been added after \"HSH\". This seems like an insertion of one letter, which would shift the reading frame from that point onward. \"HSH\" instead of \"HAS\", and \"ISA\" instead of \"HIS\". This could be a frameshift mutation.\n\nC. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HIS HAT\n\nHere, \"HAS\" is removed, and \"HIS\" is changed to \"HAT\". So, it's a deletion of \"HAS\" and a substitution in \"HIS\" to \"HAT\". This changes the sequence but doesn't necessarily shift the reading frame in the same way as a frameshift mutation would. It's more of a replacement and a deletion of a whole codon.\n\nD. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT WAS HIT\n\nIn this option, \"HAS\" is changed to \"WA\" and \"HIS\" is changed to \"HIT\". So, \"HAS\" is replaced with \"WA\" and \"HIS\" with \"HIT\". This seems like multiple substitutions or replacements, but not necessarily a frameshift.\n\nFrom these observations, option B seems to be the one where a single letter is inserted, causing the reading frame to shift from that point onward. This is characteristic of a frameshift mutation.\n\nTo make sure, let's think about it again. In option B, \"CAT HSH ISA\", if we consider the original sequence \"CAT HAS HIS\", inserting an \"I\" after \"HSH\" changes the grouping. So, \"CAT\" remains the same, but after that, it's \"HSH\" and then \"ISA\", which are different from \"HAS\" and \"HIS\". This disruption in the reading frame is what defines a frameshift mutation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HSH ISA.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
