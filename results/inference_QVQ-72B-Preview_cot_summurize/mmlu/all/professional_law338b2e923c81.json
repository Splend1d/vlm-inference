                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a nurse who was fired from his job at a hospital and wants to sue for age discrimination. He's 50 years old, and he thinks he was fired because of his age. His attorney files an age discrimination complaint in federal court against the hospital. But it turns out that the hospital hired a 52-year-old man to replace him. Now, the hospital is asking for sanctions against the nurse's attorney because of this.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what age discrimination is and how it applies here. Age discrimination typically involves treating someone less favorably because of their age, especially in employment matters. There are laws like the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) that protect individuals who are 40 years of age or older from discrimination based on age.\n\nIn this case, the nurse is 50 years old, which is covered by the ADEA. He claims he was fired because of his age. However, the hospital replaced him with someone who is 52 years old. That seems contradictory because the replacement is older, not younger. So, if the hospital was discriminating based on age, why would they hire someone older?\n\nI think the key here is that age discrimination claims often involve situations where an older employee is replaced by a younger one, suggesting that the employer prefers younger employees. But in this scenario, the replacement is actually older, which doesn't fit the typical pattern of age discrimination.\n\nNow, the hospital has filed a motion for sanctions against the nurse's attorney. Sanctions are penalties imposed by the court for certain misconduct, such as filing frivolous lawsuits or failing to conduct a reasonable inquiry before filing a complaint.\n\nThe options given are:\n\nA. No, because sanctions are not proper against the attorney of a represented party.\n\nB. No, because the hospital failed to give the attorney the chance to withdraw the complaint in advance of filing the motion with the court.\n\nC. Yes, because the nurse's attorney failed to conduct a reasonable pre-filing inquiry.\n\nD. Yes, because the nurse's complaint contained legal contentions that were not warranted by existing law based on the facts in this case.\n\nI need to evaluate these options one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: No, because sanctions are not proper against the attorney of a represented party.\n\nIs this accurate? Well, actually, sanctions can be imposed against attorneys who represent parties in litigation if they engage in misconduct or file frivolous claims. So, I don't think this is correct. The court can impose sanctions on attorneys for their conduct in litigation.\n\nMoving on to option B: No, because the hospital failed to give the attorney the chance to withdraw the complaint in advance of filing the motion with the court.\n\nI recall that under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, which governs the signing of pleadings, motions, and other papers, there is a safe harbor provision. This means that before a party files a motion for sanctions, they must serve a copy of the proposed motion on the person to be sanctioned, and that person has 21 days to correct the alleged violation. If they don't, the motion can then be filed with the court.\n\nSo, if the hospital didn't give the attorney this opportunity to withdraw the complaint, the motion for sanctions might be dismissed. However, I need to confirm whether this safe harbor applies in this situation.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"the hospital responded to the complaint by filing a motion for sanctions against the nurse's attorney.\" It doesn't specify whether they gave the attorney a chance to withdraw the complaint first. Maybe they did, or maybe they didn't. Without that information, it's hard to say.\n\nBut perhaps there's another way to look at this. Maybe the safe harbor doesn't apply in certain circumstances, like if the filing was clearly frivolous.\n\nLet me think about option C: Yes, because the nurse's attorney failed to conduct a reasonable pre-filing inquiry.\n\nThis seems relevant. Attorneys have an obligation to conduct a reasonable inquiry into the facts and law before filing a complaint. If the attorney didn't do that, and as a result, filed a complaint that was frivolous or lacked a factual basis, sanctions could be appropriate.\n\nIn this case, the attorney filed an age discrimination complaint based on the nurse's assertion that he was fired because of his age. But the hospital replaced him with someone who is older. This fact suggests that age wasn't the reason for termination, or at least, it undercuts the nurse's claim.\n\nIf the attorney knew or should have known this fact before filing the complaint, then filing the complaint might have been sanctionable.\n\nBut did the attorney know that the replacement was older? Maybe the nurse didn't tell the attorney about the replacement's age. Or perhaps the attorney didn't investigate sufficiently.\n\nThis brings me back to the reasonable inquiry standard. Attorneys are expected to make a reasonable inquiry into the facts of the case before filing a complaint. If the attorney didn't do that, and as a result, filed a complaint that was groundless, sanctions could be imposed.\n\nSo, option C seems plausible.\n\nNow, option D: Yes, because the nurse's complaint contained legal contentions that were not warranted by existing law based on the facts in this case.\n\nThis is also relevant. If the complaint's legal arguments are not supported by existing law or a good faith argument for extending, modifying, or reversing the law, sanctions may be appropriate.\n\nIn this scenario, the nurse is claiming age discrimination under the ADEA. Generally, to prove age discrimination, the employee must show that they were treated less favorably because of their age and that the adverse action was based on age-related considerations.\n\nHere, the nurse was replaced by someone who is older, which seems to contradict the idea that the hospital was discriminating based on age. Unless there are other factors at play, such as the hospital wanting to replace older employees with even older ones for some reason, which doesn't make much sense.\n\nSo, based on the facts provided, the nurse's claim seems weak, especially since the replacement is older. If the attorney knew this fact and still filed the complaint without a reasonable basis, then option D could also be correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to the story. Perhaps the nurse has other evidence of age discrimination that isn't mentioned here. The scenario only provides that the nurse was fired and replaced by a 52-year-old, which, on its face, doesn't strongly support an age discrimination claim.\n\nHowever, in practice, age discrimination cases can be complex, and there might be other factors at play, such as the hospital having a pattern of favoring younger employees in other ways.\n\nBut based solely on the information provided, it seems that the attorney might have failed to conduct a reasonable pre-filing inquiry, especially regarding the age of the replacement.\n\nSo, between options A, B, C, and D, I need to choose which ones are correct.\n\nOption A suggests that sanctions are not proper against the attorney of a represented party. That doesn't seem right, because attorneys can be sanctioned for their conduct in litigation.\n\nOption B says that the hospital failed to give the attorney a chance to withdraw the complaint before filing the motion. Without knowing whether the safe harbor provisions were followed, it's hard to be certain, but assuming they didn't, this could be a valid point.\n\nOption C indicates that the attorney failed to conduct a reasonable pre-filing inquiry, which seems plausible given the replacement's age.\n\nOption D suggests that the complaint contained legal contentions not warranted by existing law based on the facts, which also seems possible.\n\nGiven that, I think options C and D are both correct, but the question likely expects a single best answer.\n\nIf I had to choose one, I might lean towards option C, because if the attorney had conducted a reasonable inquiry and discovered that the replacement was older, they might not have filed the complaint in the first place.\n\nOption D is also valid, but it's more about the legal contentions in the complaint, whereas option C gets at the root of the issue, which is the attorney's failure to investigate adequately before filing.\n\nOption B is uncertain without knowing whether the safe harbor provisions were followed, so I'm reluctant to choose that.\n\nOption A is incorrect because attorneys can indeed be sanctioned for improper conduct in litigation.\n\nTherefore, I think the most appropriate answer is C: Yes, because the nurse's attorney failed to conduct a reasonable pre-filing inquiry.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
