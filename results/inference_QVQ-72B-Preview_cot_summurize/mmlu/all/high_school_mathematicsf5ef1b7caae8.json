                    "text": "So I have this problem about a strictly convex function, f(x), which passes through the points (-2,5) and (2,9). I need to find the range of possible values for f(1). The options are given in interval notation, and they're all of the form (-\u221e, some number). So, I need to figure out the largest possible value that f(1) can take based on the convexity of the function.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a function to be strictly convex. The definition says that for any two points a and b, with a < b, the portion of the graph between x = a and x = b lies below the straight line segment connecting (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)). In other words, the function is always curving upwards, and the chord between any two points lies above the curve.\n\nGiven that, I can think about the line segment between (-2,5) and (2,9). Since the function is strictly convex, the point (1, f(1)) should lie below this line segment at x = 1.\n\nSo, first, I need to find the equation of the line passing through (-2,5) and (2,9). Let's find the slope of this line:\n\nSlope, m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (9 - 5)/(2 - (-2)) = (4)/(4) = 1.\n\nSo, the slope is 1. Now, using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, y - y1 = m(x - x1), let's use point (-2,5):\n\ny - 5 = 1(x - (-2))\n\ny - 5 = x + 2\n\ny = x + 7\n\nSo, the equation of the line segment is y = x + 7.\n\nNow, since the function is strictly convex, at x = 1, the function value f(1) must be less than the value of this line at x = 1.\n\nLet's find y when x = 1 for the line: y = 1 + 7 = 8.\n\nTherefore, f(1) < 8.\n\nBut wait, the options are all of the form (-\u221e, some number), and 8 is one of the options. But let's think carefully. Is there a lower bound for f(1)? Well, the function could be decreasing rapidly as x approaches -2 or increasing rapidly as x approaches 2, but since it's strictly convex, it's always curving upwards, so it can't go down without bound, but in theory, since it's convex and we only have two points, f(1) could be as low as we want, I think.\n\nWait, no. If the function is strictly convex, and we have points at x = -2 and x = 2, then between x = -2 and x = 2, the function must lie below the chord connecting these points. But there's no restriction on what happens outside this interval, right? However, the problem specifies that f(x) passes through (-2,5) and (2,9), but doesn't specify anything else.\n\nWait, actually, the definition says \"between x = a and x = b,\" so for any a < b, the graph between a and b lies below the chord. But in this case, since we're looking at x = 1, which is between -2 and 2, we can apply this property specifically to the interval from x = -2 to x = 2.\n\nSo, f(1) < value of the chord at x = 1, which is 8.\n\nBut is that the only constraint? Well, the function is strictly convex, so it's always curving upwards, but within that, there could be many possible functions that pass through (-2,5) and (2,9), and for each of them, f(1) < 8.\n\nBut perhaps I need to find the tightest possible upper bound for f(1), considering the convexity.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the second derivative or something related to convex functions.\n\nA function is strictly convex if its second derivative is positive everywhere. So, f''(x) > 0 for all x.\n\nGiven that, and knowing two points, I need to find f(1).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the definition of convexity in terms of inequalities.\n\nA function is strictly convex if for any a < b, and for any t in (0,1), f(ta + (1-t)b) < t f(a) + (1-t) f(b).\n\nIn this case, a = -2, b = 2, and I want to find f(1), where 1 = t*(-2) + (1-t)*2.\n\nLet's solve for t: 1 = t*(-2) + (1-t)*2\n\n1 = -2t + 2 - 2t\n\n1 = -4t + 2\n\n-1 = -4t\n\nt = 1/4\n\nSo, t = 1/4, and 1 - t = 3/4.\n\nTherefore, by convexity:\n\nf(1) < (1/4)*f(-2) + (3/4)*f(2)\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\nf(1) < (1/4)*5 + (3/4)*9\n\nf(1) < (5/4) + (27/4)\n\nf(1) < (32/4)\n\nf(1) < 8\n\nSo, again, f(1) < 8.\n\nBut the problem says \"the range of all possible values for f(1)\", and the options are intervals of the form (-\u221e, some number).\n\nSo, if f(1) < 8, then the range is (-\u221e, 8).\n\nBut let's check if there's a lower bound.\n\nIs there a lower bound for f(1)? Well, if the function is strictly convex, it can decrease as much as it wants before x = 1, as long as it curves upwards. So, in theory, f(1) could be arbitrarily small, as long as it starts curving up before x = 1.\n\nFor example, consider a function like f(x) = x^2 + bx + c, which is strictly convex since its second derivative is positive. If I choose b and c such that f(-2) = 5 and f(2) = 9, then I can solve for b and c.\n\nLet's set up the equations:\n\nf(-2) = 4 + (-2)b + c = 5 \u21d2 -2b + c = 1 ...(1)\n\nf(2) = 4 + 2b + c = 9 \u21d2 2b + c = 5 ...(2)\n\nSubtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n4b = 4 \u21d2 b = 1\n\nPlug b = 1 into equation (2):\n\n2(1) + c = 5 \u21d2 c = 3\n\nSo, f(x) = x^2 + x + 3\n\nThen, f(1) = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5\n\nBut according to the earlier inequality, f(1) < 8, and here f(1) = 5 < 8, which satisfies the condition.\n\nCan I make f(1) even smaller? Let's try another quadratic function.\n\nConsider f(x) = x^2 + d*x + e\n\nSet f(-2) = 5 and f(2) = 9:\n\n4 - 2d + e = 5 \u21d2 -2d + e = 1 ...(1)\n\n4 + 2d + e = 9 \u21d2 2d + e = 5 ...(2)\n\nSubtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n4d = 4 \u21d2 d = 1\n\nPlug d = 1 into equation (2):\n\n2(1) + e = 5 \u21d2 e = 3\n\nSo, f(x) = x^2 + x + 3 again.\n\nWait, same as before.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Suppose I choose a different quadratic function.\n\nLet me assume f(x) = x^2 + b*x + c\n\nThen, f(-2) = 4 - 2b + c = 5 \u21d2 -2b + c = 1 ...(1)\n\nf(2) = 4 + 2b + c = 9 \u21d2 2b + c = 5 ...(2)\n\nSubtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n4b = 4 \u21d2 b = 1\n\nPlug b = 1 into equation (2):\n\n2(1) + c = 5 \u21d2 c = 3\n\nSo, f(x) = x^2 + x + 3\n\nf(1) = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5\n\nNow, can I make f(1) smaller by choosing a different quadratic function?\n\nWait, but quadratics are just one class of convex functions. Maybe there are other types of convex functions that could give smaller values for f(1).\n\nFor example, consider exponential functions. Suppose f(x) = e^{kx} + m, but that might not be convex unless k > 0.\n\nWait, actually, e^{kx} is always convex if k > 0, since its second derivative is k^2 e^{kx} > 0.\n\nLet me try f(x) = e^{x} + c\n\nThen, f(-2) = e^{-2} + c = 5 \u21d2 c = 5 - e^{-2}\n\nf(2) = e^{2} + c = 9 \u21d2 c = 9 - e^{2}\n\nBut these two expressions for c must be equal:\n\n5 - e^{-2} = 9 - e^{2}\n\ne^{2} - e^{-2} = 4\n\ne^{2} - 1/(e^{2}) = 4\n\nMultiply both sides by e^{2}:\n\n(e^{2})^2 - 1 = 4 e^{2}\n\nLet y = e^{2}, then y^2 - 1 = 4y\n\ny^2 - 4y - 1 = 0\n\nSolve for y using quadratic formula:\n\ny = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 4)] / 2 = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(20)] / 2 = [4 \u00b1 2 sqrt(5)] / 2 = 2 \u00b1 sqrt(5)\n\nSince y = e^{2} > 0, take y = 2 + sqrt(5)\n\nThen, e^{2} = 2 + sqrt(5)\n\nc = 9 - e^{2} = 9 - (2 + sqrt(5)) = 7 - sqrt(5)\n\nNow, f(1) = e^{1} + c = e + (7 - sqrt(5)) \u2248 2.718 + 7 - 2.236 \u2248 7.482\n\nThis is greater than 5, which is what I got from the quadratic function.\n\nSo, perhaps quadratics give smaller values for f(1).\n\nWait, but I need to see if I can make f(1) arbitrarily small.\n\nLet me consider a piecewise linear function that is strictly convex.\n\nSuppose f(x) is linear between (-2,5) and (2,9), but that wouldn't be strictly convex unless it's a straight line, which it is in this case, but the problem states that it's strictly convex, meaning it's curving upwards.\n\nWait, but in the case of a straight line, it's convex but not strictly convex because it doesn't curve upwards; it's just straight.\n\nSo, if f(x) is strictly convex, it must be curving upwards, meaning that between (-2,5) and (2,9), it must lie below the straight line connecting these points.\n\nTherefore, f(1) < 8, as previously determined.\n\nBut can f(1) be made arbitrarily small?\n\nConsider a function that decreases rapidly from x = -2 to x = 1, then increases rapidly from x = 1 to x = 2, always curving upwards.\n\nFor example, consider f(x) = x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 + c\n\nLet me choose c such that f(-2) = 5 and f(2) = 9.\n\nCompute f(-2):\n\n(-2)^4 - 2*(-2)^3 + (-2)^2 + c = 16 - 2*(-8) + 4 + c = 16 + 16 + 4 + c = 36 + c = 5 \u21d2 c = -31\n\nNow, f(2):\n\n(2)^4 - 2*(2)^3 + (2)^2 + (-31) = 16 - 16 + 4 - 31 = -27 \u2260 9\n\nOops, that didn't work.\n\nMaybe I need to choose a different function.\n\nLet me try f(x) = a*x^4 + b*x^3 + c*x^2 + d*x + e\n\nBut that seems too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, consider f(x) = k e^{x} + m x + n\n\nSet f(-2) = 5 and f(2) = 9.\n\nThen, k e^{-2} - 2m + n = 5\n\nk e^{2} + 2m + n = 9\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\nk(e^{2} - e^{-2}) + 4m = 4\n\nLet me denote e^{2} as a for simplicity, then e^{-2} = 1/a.\n\nSo, k(a - 1/a) + 4m = 4 ...(1)\n\nAlso, from f(-2):\n\nk/a - 2m + n = 5 ...(2)\n\nAnd from f(2):\n\nk a + 2m + n = 9 ...(3)\n\nNow, subtract equation (2) from equation (3):\n\nk a + 2m + n - (k/a - 2m + n) = 9 - 5 \u21d2 k a + 2m + n - k/a + 2m - n = 4 \u21d2 k(a - 1/a) + 4m = 4\n\nWait, that's the same as equation (1).\n\nSo, I have one equation with three variables, which is underdetermined.\n\nI need another equation to solve for k, m, and n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express m and n in terms of k.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\nk(a - 1/a) + 4m = 4 \u21d2 4m = 4 - k(a - 1/a) \u21d2 m = [4 - k(a - 1/a)] / 4\n\nNow, plug m into equation (2):\n\nk/a - 2*[4 - k(a - 1/a)]/4 + n = 5 \u21d2 k/a - (4 - k(a - 1/a))/2 + n = 5\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that since the function is strictly convex and passes through (-2,5) and (2,9), the minimal value of f(1) occurs when the function decreases as much as possible from x = -2 to x = 1, then increases to x = 2, always curving upwards.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to formalize that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the tangent lines or something related to the derivative.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the fact that for a convex function, the difference quotient is increasing.\n\nThat is, (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a) \u2264 (f(c) - f(a))/(c - a) for a < b < c.\n\nIn this case, a = -2, b = 1, c = 2.\n\nSo, (f(1) - f(-2))/(1 - (-2)) \u2264 (f(2) - f(-2))/(2 - (-2))\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n(f(1) - 5)/(1 - (-2)) \u2264 (9 - 5)/(2 - (-2))\n\n(f(1) - 5)/3 \u2264 4/4 \u21d2 (f(1) - 5)/3 \u2264 1 \u21d2 f(1) - 5 \u2264 3 \u21d2 f(1) \u2264 8\n\nAgain, I get f(1) \u2264 8.\n\nBut is there a lower bound?\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the second inequality from convexity.\n\nFor a convex function, (f(c) - f(b))/(c - b) \u2265 (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a) for a < b < c.\n\nSo, (f(2) - f(1))/(2 - 1) \u2265 (f(1) - f(-2))/(1 - (-2))\n\nPlugging in:\n\n(9 - f(1))/1 \u2265 (f(1) - 5)/3 \u21d2 9 - f(1) \u2265 (f(1) - 5)/3 \u21d2 multiply both sides by 3: 27 - 3f(1) \u2265 f(1) - 5 \u21d2 27 - 3f(1) - f(1) + 5 \u2265 0 \u21d2 32 - 4f(1) \u2265 0 \u21d2 32 \u2265 4f(1) \u21d2 f(1) \u2264 8\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, it seems consistent that f(1) \u2264 8.\n\nNow, is there a lower bound?\n\nFrom the definition of convexity, there is no lower bound specified for f(1), as the function can decrease without bound before x = 1, as long as it curves upwards.\n\nTherefore, the range of possible values for f(1) is (-\u221e, 8].\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. (-\u221e, 8)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
