                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out whether the court is likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nFirst, there's a mail clerk who lives in State A but works for an employer in State B. The employer leases space in a building owned by a State C corporation. The clerk slips and falls on ice near the loading dock of this building in State B, gets injured, and damages an expensive computer he was carrying. Now, the clerk sues the building owner for negligence in a federal district court in State B, asking for $100,000 in personal-injury damages. The employer also wants to intervene in this lawsuit to make a claim against the building owner for the $80,000 damage to its computer.\n\nOkay, so the employer is trying to intervene in the clerk's lawsuit against the building owner. I need to see if the court is likely to allow this.\n\nI remember that intervention in a lawsuit can happen in certain circumstances, especially when someone who isn't already a party has an interest in the case. There are different types of intervention, like intervention as of right or permissive intervention.\n\nLet me recall the rules for intervention. Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs intervention. There's intervention as of right and permissive intervention.\n\nIntervention as of right, under Rule 24(a), allows someone to intervene when they have an interest in the subject of the action and that interest might be impaired or impeded without their presence, and their interest isn't adequately represented by existing parties.\n\nPermissive intervention, under Rule 24(b), allows someone to intervene if they have a claim or defense that shares common questions of law or fact with the main action.\n\nIn this case, the employer is trying to intervene to make a separate claim for the damage to its computer. So, it's not directly part of the clerk's personal injury claim, but it's related because it involves the same incident and the same defendant.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. No, because although the employer has an interest in the clerk's action, that interest is not likely to be impaired in the employer's absence.\n\nHmm, the employer does have an interest in the action since the damage to the computer was caused by the same incident that led to the clerk's injury. But is their interest likely to be impaired if they don't intervene? Well, if the building owner is found negligent towards the clerk, maybe the employer can bring its own separate lawsuit later. But perhaps there's some risk that the building owner might not have enough assets to satisfy both judgments, or that the clerk's lawsuit might somehow affect the employer's ability to sue later.\n\nB. No, because the clerk chose not to join the employer as a co-plaintiff in his action.\n\nWait, the clerk didn't include the employer in the lawsuit. But does that mean the employer can't intervene? Maybe the clerk didn't want to include the employer for some reason, or perhaps the employer decided to pursue its own claim separately.\n\nC. Yes, because the employer is an indispensable party.\n\nIs the employer an indispensable party? I think \"indispensable party\" is a concept related to joinder of parties under Rule 19. An indispensable party is someone who should be joined in the lawsuit if feasible because their absence would impair the ability of the existing parties to protect their interests or leave the court unable to accord complete relief. If joinder isn't feasible, the court may dismiss the action if equity and justice require it.\n\nIn this case, is the employer indispensable? The clerk is suing the building owner for his personal injuries, and the employer wants to make a separate claim for the computer damage. Maybe the employer could sue separately, so perhaps it's not indispensable to the clerk's action. But I'm not sure.\n\nD. Yes, because the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action.\n\nThis sounds like permissive intervention under Rule 24(b). Both the clerk and the employer are claiming negligence against the building owner based on the same incident. So, there are likely common questions of law (negligence, duty of care, etc.) and facts (what caused the ice, who was responsible, etc.).\n\nGiven that, option D seems plausible.\n\nBut let's think more carefully. Is the employer's claim so separate that it shouldn't be allowed to intervene, or is it closely tied to the clerk's action?\n\nThe incident involved both the clerk's injury and the computer damage simultaneously. So, the facts surrounding the incident are the same for both claims. Also, the legal theory is likely the same\u2014negligence due to the icy condition of the loading dock.\n\nMoreover, having both claims heard in the same proceeding might be more efficient, avoiding the need for separate trials on similar issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the clerk might prefer to keep his personal injury claim separate from the employer's property damage claim.\n\nBut from a judicial efficiency perspective, it makes sense to consolidate related claims when possible.\n\nAlso, considering that the building owner is a common defendant, it's efficient to resolve both claims at once.\n\nNow, is this intervention as of right or permissive?\n\nIntervention as of right requires that the intervenor has an interest in the action that could be impaired if they don't intervene, and that their interest isn't adequately represented by existing parties.\n\nIn this case, the employer has an interest in the action because of the computer damage, but is that interest likely to be impaired if they don't intervene? Maybe not directly, since they could potentially sue separately later. However, there might be some risk of inconsistent judgments or that the building owner's liability might be established in the clerk's case, making it easier for the employer to recover in a separate action. But perhaps the employer wants to have its claim heard now to avoid delays.\n\nAlternatively, permissive intervention seems more applicable here, as the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action.\n\nSo, option D seems correct: yes, the court is likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene because the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action.\n\nBut let me check option C again. Is the employer an indispensable party?\n\nUnder Rule 19, a party is indispensable if:\n\n(a) the person claims an interest in the subject matter of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in their absence may (i) impair or impede their ability to protect their interest, or (ii) leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations; and\n\n(b) the person is not adequately represented by existing parties.\n\nIn this case, the employer has its own claim for the computer damage, which is separate from the clerk's personal injury claim. The employer could potentially sue separately, so its ability to protect its interest isn't entirely dependent on being in this lawsuit. However, there might be some risk of inconsistent judgments if both the clerk and the employer sue the building owner separately for the same incident.\n\nBut generally, courts allow separate lawsuits for different claims arising from the same incident, especially if the claims are distinct in nature\u2014one being personal injury and the other property damage.\n\nTherefore, I don't think the employer is an indispensable party. So, option C is probably incorrect.\n\nOption A suggests that the employer's interest isn't likely to be impaired in their absence. While there might be some impairment, it's not necessarily so significant that intervention as of right is warranted, especially since the employer can bring its own lawsuit later.\n\nOption B says no because the clerk didn't join the employer as a co-plaintiff. But that might not be a determining factor for intervention.\n\nSo, the best answer seems to be D: yes, because the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
