                    "text": "So I have this question about David Baltimore, the molecular biologist. It's asking what he discovered, and the options are:\n\nA. The structure of DNA\n\nB. X-ray crystallographic techniques\n\nC. The enzyme reverse transcriptase\n\nD. The anti-HIV drug zidovudine\n\nHmm, I need to recall who David Baltimore is and what he's famous for discovering.\n\nFirst off, I know that molecular biology is a field that deals with the molecular basis of biological activity, things like DNA, RNA, proteins, and how they interact to carry out life processes. So, David Baltimore is someone who works in this area.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: The structure of DNA. I remember that the structure of DNA was discovered by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, with some crucial data provided by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. So, that was way before David Baltimore's time. He was born in 1938, so he would have been a young researcher when that happened. But I don't think he was involved in the initial discovery of the DNA structure.\n\nOption B: X-ray crystallographic techniques. These are methods used to determine the atomic and molecular structure of crystals, and they were developed in the early 20th century by people like William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg. Again, this is long before David Baltimore's time. He might have used these techniques in his research, but he didn't discover them.\n\nOption C: The enzyme reverse transcriptase. Now, this sounds familiar in relation to David Baltimore. Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that transcribes RNA into DNA, which is the opposite of the usual direction from DNA to RNA. This was a groundbreaking discovery because it showed that the flow of genetic information isn't always from DNA to RNA to protein, but can also go from RNA to DNA under certain circumstances.\n\nI think David Baltimore discovered reverse transcriptase in the early 1970s, which was a major contribution to our understanding of how viruses work, especially retroviruses like HIV. In fact, this discovery led to him sharing the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1975 with Howard Temin and Renato Dulbecco.\n\nOption D: The anti-HIV drug zidovudine. Zidovudine, also known as AZT, is a medication used to treat and prevent HIV/AIDS. It works by inhibiting the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is crucial for the replication of HIV. The discovery and development of zidovudine happened in the 1980s, after the discovery of reverse transcriptase.\n\nWhile David Baltimore's work on reverse transcriptase was instrumental in understanding HIV and led to the development of drugs like zidovudine, I don't believe he was directly involved in the discovery or development of the drug itself. He laid the foundation for such developments, but the actual discovery of the drug was done by others.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the correct answer is C. The enzyme reverse transcriptase.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nWatson and Crick discovered the structure of DNA in 1953.\n\nX-ray crystallographic techniques were developed in the early 1900s.\n\nReverse transcriptase was discovered by David Baltimore and Howard Temin in the early 1970s.\n\nZidovudine was developed in the 1980s by researchers at the pharmaceutical company Burroughs Wellcome.\n\nSo, yes, David Baltimore is known for discovering reverse transcriptase, which was a significant scientific breakthrough and aligns with his work in molecular biology.\n\nI think that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
