Moviefone. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that '411' is a common dialing code in North America for information services. But specifically, what does '411' get you? Let me think about this.\n\nOption A is the police. I don't think that's right. In most places, dialing '911' gets you emergency services, including the police. '411' seems different; it's not an emergency number, so probably not the police.\n\nOption B is the White House. That doesn't sound right either. The White House has its own contact number, and I doubt it's '411'. That seems more like a general information service.\n\nOption C is directory assistance. Now, this rings a bell. I think '411' is the number you dial to get help finding a phone number or address, right? Like, if you need to find a plumber or a restaurant, you can call '411' and they'll give you the number. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nOption D is Moviefone. Moviefone is a service that provides movie listings and tickets, but I don't think dialing '411' would connect you to Moviefone. I believe Moviefone has its own specific phone number, not '411'.\n\nSo, based on what I know, '411' is directory assistance. That's where you can call to get information about phone numbers and addresses. It's a service that helps you find contact information for businesses or people.\n\nLet me double-check this. In the United States, '411' is indeed the number for directory assistance. It's a paid service where an operator assists you in finding a phone number or address. So, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll confirm if any of the other options could possibly be associated with '411'. The police are usually reached via '911' in emergencies, or a non-emergency number for non-urgent matters. The White House has its own switchboard number, which is publicly available but not '411'. And Moviefone has its own distinct phone number for movie listings and tickets.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. directory assistance. Dialing '411' on a telephone connects you to directory assistance, where you can obtain phone numbers and addresses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
