They had a business attorney helping them set up the business, but now the business has failed, and they're in disagreement over their obligations. At trial, the plaintiff is calling the business attorney to testify about what the defendant said in meetings that included the plaintiff, the defendant, and the attorney. The defendant is objecting to this testimony, citing the attorney-client privilege.\n\nI need to figure out whether the court should uphold the defendant's privilege claim. The options are:\n\nA. No, because the business attorney's professional relationship with the plaintiff and the defendant has ended.\n\nB. No, because the plaintiff and the defendant consulted the business attorney jointly.\n\nC. Yes, because either the plaintiff or the defendant may block disclosure of statements made during such meetings.\n\nD. Yes, because either the plaintiff or the defendant may claim the privilege on behalf of the partnership.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand the attorney-client privilege in the context of a partnership. Normally, the attorney-client privilege protects communications between a client and their attorney when seeking legal advice. But in a partnership, it gets a bit trickier because there are multiple clients\u2014the individual partners and the partnership entity itself.\n\nIn a partnership, the privilege generally belongs to the partnership, not to any individual partner. So, communications made for the purpose of the partnership's business are protected by the privilege, and all partners have the right to assert or waive that privilege.\n\nBut here's the catch: when there's a dispute between the partners themselves, especially when the partnership is dissolving or there's litigation among partners, the privilege can be tricky to apply.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, the business attorney was representing the partnership and possibly the individual partners in setting up the business. So, communications made in that context would be covered by the attorney-client privilege.\n\nNow, the business has failed, and the partners are suing each other. The plaintiff is trying to call the attorney to testify about what the defendant said in those past meetings.\n\nThe defendant is objecting, claiming the attorney-client privilege.\n\nSo, the question is, who controls the privilege in this situation? Is it the partnership, or are the individual partners entitled to assert the privilege separately?\n\nI recall that in partnerships, the privilege generally belongs to the partnership itself. So, individual partners can't unilaterally assert or waive the privilege without the consent of the other partners, especially if the communications were made for the partnership's benefit.\n\nBut, in a dispute between partners, sometimes the privilege is waived as to one another because they're adverse parties now.\n\nWait, there's a doctrine called the \"joint client\" doctrine or the \"common interest\" doctrine, which might apply here. This doctrine generally holds that when multiple clients share a common interest and consult the same attorney, communications between them are protected by the attorney-client privilege.\n\nHowever, when those clients become adversaries, the privilege may not prevent one client from disclosing communications to the other, or vice versa.\n\nIn this case, the plaintiff and the defendant were jointly consulting the same business attorney. Now that they're adversaries, does that mean that the plaintiff can call the attorney to testify about the defendant's statements without the defendant's consent?\n\nOption B says, \"No, because the plaintiff and the defendant consulted the business attorney jointly.\" But that seems contradictory because if they consulted jointly, shouldn't their communications be privileged?\n\nWait, maybe not. Because in some jurisdictions, when clients consult an attorney jointly, the privilege belongs to all of them collectively, and no single client can unilaterally waive it without the others' consent. But in a dispute between those clients, the privilege may be waived as to the dispute.\n\nOption A says, \"No, because the business attorney's professional relationship with the plaintiff and the defendant has ended.\"\n\nHmm, I'm not sure about that. Just because the attorney-client relationship has ended doesn't necessarily mean that the privilege no longer applies. Privilege generally survives the termination of the attorney-client relationship.\n\nOption C says, \"Yes, because either the plaintiff or the defendant may block disclosure of statements made during such meetings.\"\n\nThis suggests that the privilege still applies, and either party can assert it to prevent testimony about privileged communications.\n\nOption D says, \"Yes, because either the plaintiff or the defendant may claim the privilege on behalf of the partnership.\"\n\nThis seems similar to Option C, indicating that the privilege belongs to the partnership, and either party can assert it.\n\nBut I think there's a nuanced issue here. In a partnership dispute, especially when the partnership is dissolving, the control over the privilege can be tricky.\n\nI recall that in some cases, when partners are suing each other, the privilege may be waived as to the dispute between them, meaning that one partner can't use the privilege to prevent the other from obtaining relevant information.\n\nHowever, in other cases, the privilege is still recognized, and individual partners can't be forced to disclose privileged communications without the consent of the other partners.\n\nI need to think about which approach is more commonly followed.\n\nLet me consider this: if the communications were made for the purpose of the partnership's business, then the privilege belongs to the partnership. In a dispute between partners, the partnership may be represented by one of the partners or by separate counsel.\n\nBut in this scenario, it seems that the partnership has failed, and there might not be a functioning partnership entity to control the privilege.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the partnership is still in existence but is being dissolved through litigation.\n\nIn such a case, the privilege would typically remain with the partnership, and the partners would need to agree on how to handle privileged information.\n\nBut when there's a dispute between partners, sometimes the privilege is waived as to the dispute, allowing one partner to use communications against the other.\n\nI think the key here is whether the communications are relevant to the dispute between the partners and whether disclosing them would serve the interests of justice.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, when partners are suing each other and the communications in question are directly relevant to the dispute, the privilege may be waived, allowing the testimony.\n\nSo, in this case, since the plaintiff is suing the defendant over obligations related to the partnership, and the business attorney was involved in setting up the partnership, the communications between the defendant and the attorney might be relevant to the plaintiff's claims.\n\nTherefore, the plaintiff should be able to call the attorney to testify about what the defendant said in those meetings, despite the defendant's objection based on privilege.\n\nThis would align with Option B: \"No, because the plaintiff and the defendant consulted the business attorney jointly.\"\n\nWait, but Option B seems to suggest that because they consulted jointly, the privilege applies, but in reality, when there's a dispute between joint clients, the privilege may not prevent one client from disclosing communications to the other.\n\nSo, perhaps Option B is incorrect, and the court should not uphold the defendant's privilege claim.\n\nOption A seems off because the end of the attorney-client relationship doesn't necessarily end the privilege.\n\nOption C and D both suggest that the privilege can be asserted by either party, which might be true in some contexts, but in a dispute between partners, the privilege might be waived as to the dispute.\n\nI think the correct answer is that the court should not uphold the defendant's privilege claim because, in a dispute between joint clients, the privilege does not prevent one client from disclosing communications to the other in the context of the dispute.\n\nTherefore, the plaintiff should be allowed to call the business attorney to testify about the defendant's representations.\n\nSo, the answer is B. No, because the plaintiff and the defendant consulted the business attorney jointly.\n\nWait, but the way Option B is phrased, it says \"No, because the plaintiff and the defendant consulted the business attorney jointly.\" That seems to suggest that because they consulted jointly, the privilege doesn't apply, which aligns with my reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phrasing is misleading, and it's actually supporting the idea that the privilege does apply because they consulted jointly.\n\nBut based on my understanding, in a dispute between joint clients, the privilege may not prevent one client from disclosing communications to the other in the context of the dispute.\n\nTherefore, the court should not uphold the defendant's privilege claim, and the plaintiff should be allowed to call the business attorney to testify.\n\nSo, the answer is B. No, because the plaintiff and the defendant consulted the business attorney jointly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
