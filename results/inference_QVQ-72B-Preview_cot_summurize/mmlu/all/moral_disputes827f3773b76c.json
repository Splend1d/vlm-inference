                    "text": " So I've been thinking about this Thomson's conclusion regarding abortion, and I'm trying to wrap my head around what it implies. The question is saying that if Thomson's conclusion is correct, then which of these options follows from that. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Thomson's conclusion is. I think of Thomson's violinist analogy, where she compares the fetus's right to life to a famous violinist who is hooked up to your body without your consent. In that scenario, you have the right to disconnect yourself from the violinist, even if it means he dies, because you don't owe him anything. So, her main point is that even if the fetus is a person with a right to life, the mother still has the right to detach it from her body.\n\nSo, if Thomson's conclusion is correct, it means that a woman has the right to choose whether to continue a pregnancy, even if the fetus is considered a person with a right to life.\n\nLooking at option A: \"the abortion issue cannot be settled just by determining at what stage (if any) the fetus is a person.\"\n\nThis seems to align with Thomson's argument. She's saying that even if the fetus is a person, the mother's right to choose still stands. So, determining personhood isn't the only factor in deciding whether abortion is permissible.\n\nOption B: \"abortion is always morally permissible.\"\n\nThomson's argument doesn't say that abortion is always morally permissible. She's arguing that it's permissible for the mother to detach the fetus under certain conditions, like in the violinist analogy. But she doesn't say it's always permissible. There might be other considerations or circumstances where abortion isn't morally permissible.\n\nOption C: \"abortion is never morally permissible.\"\n\nThis contradicts Thomson's conclusion. If Thomson is saying that it's permissible for the mother to detach the fetus under certain conditions, then it's not the case that abortion is never morally permissible.\n\nOption D: \"the abortion issue can be settled just by determining at what stage (if any) the fetus is a person.\"\n\nThis seems opposite to what Thomson is arguing. She's saying that even if the fetus is a person, the mother's rights still matter, so determining personhood isn't sufficient to settle the issue.\n\nGiven this, it seems like option A is the correct choice because it reflects Thomson's argument that personhood isn't the only factor in the abortion debate. But let me double-check.\n\nIf Thomson's conclusion is correct, and she argues that the mother has the right to detach the fetus even if it's a person, then it follows that determining when the fetus becomes a person isn't the only thing needed to settle the abortion issue. There are other considerations, like the mother's rights and autonomy.\n\nSo, option A seems to be the best fit.\n\nWait, but maybe option D could be considered if Thomson's conclusion is incorrect. But the question says that Thomson's conclusion is correct, so we have to assume it's valid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: the abortion issue cannot be settled just by determining at what stage (if any) the fetus is a person.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
