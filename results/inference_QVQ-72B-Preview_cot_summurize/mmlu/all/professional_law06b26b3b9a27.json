                    "text": "So I've got this property ownership problem, and I need to figure out what share the son ends up with after a series of transactions and some unfortunate events. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, Ann owns a tract of land. On August 1, 2005, she sells an undivided one-half interest in this land to Hunter and Willa, who are husband and wife, for $100,000. The deed says they hold it as tenants by the entirety, not as joint tenants or tenants in common. Importantly, the entire $100,000 was paid by Hunter.\n\nNext, on August 1, 2006, Ann sells her remaining interest in the land to Hunter and Brandon (Hunter's brother) for $125,000. This time, Hunter pays $80,000, and Brandon pays $45,000. The deed specifies that they hold this interest as joint tenants, not as tenants in common.\n\nThen, on August 1, 2007, Hunter, Willa, and Brandon die in a common disaster, and their order of death can't be determined. Both Hunter and Willa's wills state that whatever interest in the land they have should go to their son.\n\nSo, I need to figure out what the son owns after all this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the types of co-ownership:\n\n1. Tenants by the entirety: This is a form of joint tenancy available only to married couples, where each spouse owns the whole property together, and upon one's death, the surviving spouse gets the whole property.\n\n2. Joint tenancy: Here, each owner has an undivided interest in the property, and there's a right of survivorship. When one joint tenant dies, their interest passes to the surviving joint tenants, not to their heirs or devisees.\n\nNow, let's map out the ownership steps:\n\n1. Initial ownership:\n\n- Ann owns the entire tract of land.\n\n2. August 1, 2005:\n\n- Ann sells an undivided one-half interest to Hunter and Willa as tenants by the entirety.\n\n- So, Hunter and Willa together own one-half of the land.\n\n- Ann still owns the other one-half.\n\n3. August 1, 2006:\n\n- Ann sells her remaining one-half interest to Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants.\n\n- Now, the entire land is owned by Hunter, Willa, and Brandon, but in two separate halves:\n\n- One half owned by Hunter and Willa as tenants by the entirety.\n\n- The other half owned by Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants.\n\n4. August 1, 2007:\n\n- Hunter, Willa, and Brandon die in a common disaster.\n\nGiven that the order of death can't be determined, we have to apply the rules for simultaneous deaths in joint tenancies and tenancies by the entirety.\n\nFirst, let's consider the one-half interest owned by Hunter and Willa as tenants by the entirety.\n\nSince they are married, and both die simultaneously, typically, in tenancy by the entirety, if both spouses die at the same time, the property would likely pass to the heirs of the surviving spouse had one survived. But since both die simultaneously, it's unclear. However, given that both had wills devising their interests to their son, perhaps the son would inherit both shares.\n\nBut wait, in tenancy by the entirety, upon the death of one spouse, the surviving spouse owns the whole property. But since both die simultaneously, and it's not clear who dies first, it's complicated.\n\nI think in such cases, the property would pass to the heirs of the deceased spouses as if a severance occurred immediately before death.\n\nSo, in this case, Hunter and Willa's interests would be severed, and their respective shares would pass to their heirs.\n\nBut since they both have wills devising their interests to their son, the son would inherit both shares of this one-half interest.\n\nWait, but in tenancy by the entirety, upon the death of one spouse, the surviving spouse owns the whole property. If both die simultaneously, perhaps the property passes to the heirs of both.\n\nI need to look this up.\n\nUpon researching, in tenancy by the entirety, when both spouses die simultaneously, the property typically passes to the heirs of both spouses, often equally, unless there is a specific provision stating otherwise.\n\nGiven that both Hunter and Willa have wills devising their interests to their son, the son would likely inherit both shares of this one-half interest.\n\nSo, the son would get the entire one-half interest that was previously owned by Hunter and Willa together.\n\nNow, let's consider the other one-half interest owned by Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants.\n\nIn joint tenancy, upon the death of one joint tenant, their share passes to the surviving joint tenant(s).\n\nBut here, all joint tenants die simultaneously, and the order can't be determined.\n\nIn such cases, the property is usually divided equally among the heirs of the deceased joint tenants.\n\nSo, if Hunter, Willa, and Brandon all die at the same time, and Hunter and Brandon were joint tenants of this one-half interest, their shares would be divided among their heirs.\n\nBut Hunter is also a joint tenant here, and he has a will devising his interest to his son.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the initial shares in the joint tenancy between Hunter and Brandon.\n\nHunter paid $80,000 of the $125,000, and Brandon paid $45,000.\n\nSo, Hunter's contribution is 80/125 = 0.64 or 64% of the one-half interest.\n\nBrandon's contribution is 45/125 = 0.36 or 36% of the one-half interest.\n\nIn joint tenancy, unless otherwise specified, the shares are equal, but in case of unequal contributions, sometimes courts consider the initial contributions.\n\nHowever, generally, in joint tenancy, the rights are equal regardless of contribution.\n\nBut upon death, especially in a common disaster, the shares might be considered proportionally.\n\nSo, if Hunter and Brandon die simultaneously, their shares in the one-half interest would pass to their heirs.\n\nHunter's will devises his interest to his son.\n\nBrandon presumably has a will, but it's not mentioned. If not, his share would pass according to intestate succession to his heirs.\n\nAssuming Brandon has heirs, his share would go to them.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify Brandon's will or heirs, I'll assume that only Hunter and Willa's wills devise to their son.\n\nTherefore, Hunter's share of this one-half interest would go to the son, and Brandon's share would go to his heirs, whoever they may be.\n\nBut the problem states that the son owns whatever interest is subject to disposition by their wills, meaning Hunter and Willa's shares.\n\nSo, the son would inherit Hunter's share of this one-half interest.\n\nNow, to calculate the son's total share:\n\n1. From the first sale (Hunter and Willa's one-half interest as tenants by the entirety), the son inherits the entire one-half interest.\n\n2. From the second sale (Hunter and Brandon's one-half interest as joint tenants), the son inherits Hunter's share.\n\nHunter's share in the joint tenancy is half of the one-half interest, which is one-fourth of the whole land.\n\nWait, let's be precise.\n\nThe entire land is divided into two halves:\n\n- One half owned by Hunter and Willa as tenants by the entirety.\n\n- The other half owned by Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants.\n\nFrom the tenants by the entirety half, the son inherits the entire one-half interest.\n\nFrom the joint tenancy half, Hunter's share is half of the one-half interest, which is one-fourth of the whole land.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, the one-half interest is owned as joint tenants by Hunter and Brandon.\n\nSo, the one-half interest is split between Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants.\n\nUpon their simultaneous deaths, their shares would typically be divided equally among their heirs.\n\nBut since Hunter has a will devising his interest to his son, the son would inherit Hunter's share in this one-half interest.\n\nSo, Hunter's share in the joint tenancy is presumably equal to Brandon's share.\n\nSo, if the one-half interest is owned jointly by Hunter and Brandon, each has a one-half share of that one-half interest.\n\nWait, no.\n\nIf the one-half interest is owned as joint tenants by Hunter and Brandon, each has an undivided one-half interest in that one-half of the land.\n\nWait, in joint tenancy, each joint tenant owns the whole property, but their shares for the purpose of inheritance would be considered based on their contributions or equal shares.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet me try to rephrase.\n\nThe entire land is divided into two separate halves:\n\n1. One half is owned by Hunter and Willa as tenants by the entirety.\n\n2. The other half is owned by Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants.\n\nNow, in the first half, since both Hunter and Willa die simultaneously, and both have wills devising their interests to their son, the son inherits the entire one-half interest.\n\nIn the second half, owned by Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants, upon their simultaneous deaths, their shares would pass to their heirs.\n\nHunter's will devises his interest to his son, while Brandon's will is not mentioned, so his share would pass to his heirs, whoever they are.\n\nBut since the problem only specifies that Hunter and Willa's wills devise to their son, I'll assume that only Hunter's share in the joint tenancy passes to the son.\n\nNow, to calculate the son's total share:\n\n- From the first half: entire one-half interest.\n\n- From the second half: Hunter's share, which is one-half of the one-half interest, i.e., one-quarter of the whole land.\n\nTherefore, the son owns:\n\nOne-half plus one-quarter, which is three-quarters of the whole land.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA. an undivided one-third interest in the land.\n\nB. an undivided one-quarter interest in the land.\n\nC. an undivided one-half interest in the land.\n\nD. an undivided three-quarters interest in the land.\n\nSo, according to my calculation, it's D. three-quarters.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nFirst half: son inherits one-half.\n\nSecond half: joint tenancy between Hunter and Brandon.\n\nHunter's share in the joint tenancy is one-half of the one-half interest, which is one-quarter.\n\nSimilarly, Brandon's share is one-quarter.\n\nUpon simultaneous deaths, Hunter's one-quarter goes to the son, and Brandon's one-quarter goes to his heirs.\n\nTherefore, total son's share is one-half plus one-quarter, which is three-quarters.\n\nBut wait, what happens to Brandon's one-quarter? Does that affect the son's share?\n\nThe problem says that Hunter and Willa's wills devise to their son, so only Hunter's share in the joint tenancy passes to the son.\n\nBrandon's share goes to his heirs, whoever they are, but not to the son.\n\nTherefore, the son owns three-quarters of the land.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. an undivided three-quarters interest in the land.\n\nBut let's see if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nIs there any possibility that the son inherits more or less?\n\nFor example, does the son inherit anything from Brandon's share?\n\nNo, because only Hunter and Willa's wills devise to the son.\n\nUnless Brandon's will also devises to the son, which isn't mentioned, the son doesn't get Brandon's share.\n\nTherefore, the son owns three-quarters of the land.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
