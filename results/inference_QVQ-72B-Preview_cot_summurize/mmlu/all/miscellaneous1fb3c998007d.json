A declaration of war by Congress\n\nB. The passage of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution by Congress\n\nC. A United Nations resolution condemning the North Vietnamese invasion of South Vietnam\n\nD. The mutual defense provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the Vietnam War was a pretty significant conflict for the U.S., but I don't recall there being an official declaration of war by Congress. I think the last time the U.S. officially declared war was during World War II, against countries like Japan, Germany, and Italy. So, option A seems unlikely.\n\nNext, the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution rings a bell. I think it was a resolution passed by Congress in response to an incident in the Gulf of Tonkin involving U.S. naval ships and North Vietnamese forces. It gave the president more authority to use military force in Vietnam. Yeah, that sounds like it could be the legal basis for escalation.\n\nLet me double-check that. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was passed in 1964, and it authorized the president to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against U.S. forces and to prevent further aggression in the area. So, that would have allowed the president to escalate U.S. involvement in Vietnam without a formal declaration of war. That seems fitting.\n\nOption C is about a United Nations resolution condemning the North Vietnamese invasion of South Vietnam. I don't remember there being a specific UN resolution that directly authorized U.S. intervention in Vietnam. The UN was involved in some peacekeeping efforts in Southeast Asia during that time, but I don't think they issued a resolution that specifically condemned North Vietnam's invasion or authorized the U.S. to intervene militarily.\n\nAs for option D, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is a defensive alliance primarily focused on Europe and North America. Its mutual defense provisions are outlined in Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which states that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all. However, Vietnam wasn't a member of NATO, and the conflict in Vietnam wasn't directly tied to NATO's mandate. So, it's hard to see how NATO's mutual defense provisions would provide a legal basis for U.S. involvement in Vietnam.\n\nPutting all this together, it seems that the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was the key legal basis for the U.S. to escalate its involvement in Vietnam. It gave the president the necessary authority to send more troops and increase military operations without having to go through the process of declaring a formal war.\n\nJust to make sure I'm not missing something, I'll quickly recap:\n\n- Option A: No formal declaration of war by Congress for Vietnam.\n\n- Option B: Gulf of Tonkin Resolution granted presidential authority to escalate military involvement.\n\n- Option C: No specific UN resolution authorizing U.S. intervention in Vietnam.\n\n- Option D: NATO's focus is on European and North American defense, not directly applicable to Vietnam.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. The passage of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution by Congress.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
