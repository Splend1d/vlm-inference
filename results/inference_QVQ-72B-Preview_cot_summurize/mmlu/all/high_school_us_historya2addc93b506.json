Jefferson was very tall, six feet two-and-a-half inches in height; sandy-complexioned; shy in manner, seeming cold; awkward in attitude, and with little in his bearing that suggested command.\u2026 His skin was thin, peeling from his face on exposure to the sun, giving it a tettered appearance. This sandy face, with hazel eyes and sunny aspect; this loose, shackling person; this rambling and often brilliant conversation, belonged to the controlling influences of American history, more necessary to the story than three-fourths of the official papers, which only hid the truth. Jefferson's personality during these eight years appeared to be the government, and impressed itself, like that of Bonaparte, although by a different process, on the mind of the nation. In the village simplicity of Washington, he was more than a king, for he was alone in social as well as in political pre-eminence.

                    "text": "So I'm reading this passage from Henry Adams' \"History of the United States During the Administration of Thomas Jefferson,\" and it's about Jefferson taking office in 1801. The question is asking what Henry Adams thought about the city of Washington at that time. The options are:\n\nA. The hub of American economic power\n\nB. Rapidly turning into the \"Paris\" of North America\n\nC. Still an underdeveloped cultural backwater\n\nD. Still under the control of the British\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Adams is saying about Washington in 1801. He describes it as having \"village simplicity,\" and mentions that except for the British Legation, no other house was open to general society. He also says that politicians, even the Federalists, were dependent on Jefferson and \"The Palace\" for amusement. If they didn't go there, they \"lived like bears, brutalized and stupefied.\"\n\nLet me break this down. \"Village simplicity\" suggests that Washington wasn't a big, bustling city yet. It was probably small and not very sophisticated. The fact that only the British Legation was open to general society implies that there weren't many public spaces or social venues available. Most social life revolved around Jefferson's house, \"The Palace,\" which was likely the President's Mansion, now known as the White House.\n\nAdams also mentions that if people didn't go to Jefferson's place for amusement, they had a pretty dull and perhaps uncultured existence. The phrase \"lived like bears, brutalized and stupefied\" sounds pretty negative, suggesting a lack of refinement or cultural activities.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like Washington in 1801 was not a thriving cultural center. It was more of a small, underdeveloped place with limited social and cultural offerings.\n\nLet's look at the options again:\n\nA. The hub of American economic power \u2013 This doesn't seem to fit because the passage makes it sound more like a small village, not a major economic center.\n\nB. Rapidly turning into the \"Paris\" of North America \u2013 This also doesn't align with the description of village simplicity and limited social life. Paris is known for its culture and sophistication, which Washington apparently lacked at that time.\n\nC. Still an underdeveloped cultural backwater \u2013 This seems to match the description quite well. The city is portrayed as simple, with few public spaces, and social life centered around one person's house.\n\nD. Still under the control of the British \u2013 This is not supported by the passage. The British Legation was present, but that doesn't mean the city was under British control. The Legation was likely the British embassy, which is normal for a capital city.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. Still an underdeveloped cultural backwater. Adams' description paints a picture of a city that hasn't yet grown into a significant cultural center, which aligns perfectly with this option.\n\nJust to make sure, let me check if there's any other way to interpret the passage. Adams mentions the British Legation being open to general society, but doesn't say anything about British control over the city. So, option D is definitely out. Option A is about economic power, but the passage focuses on social and cultural aspects, not economics. Option B suggests positive development towards a cultural capital, which contradicts the negative tone of the passage regarding the lack of cultural activities.\n\nHence, option C is the correct choice based on the information provided in the passage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
