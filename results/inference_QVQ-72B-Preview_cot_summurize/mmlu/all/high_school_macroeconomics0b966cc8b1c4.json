                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to figure out which of these options would lead to an increase in the money supply. I'm not super confident about monetary policy yet, but I'll try to work through it.\n\nOption A says a decrease in the required reserve ratio. Hmm, the required reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that banks have to keep as reserves instead of lending out. So, if the required reserve ratio decreases, that means banks have to keep less money in reserves, right? That should mean they can lend out more money. When banks lend out more money, doesn't that create more money in the economy? Like, when you take a loan, new money enters the system. So, if banks are lending more, the money supply should go up. So, option A seems like it could lead to an increase in the money supply.\n\nOption B is an increase in the discount rate. The discount rate is the interest rate that the Federal Reserve charges banks when they borrow money from the Fed. If the discount rate increases, it should make it more expensive for banks to borrow money. That might make banks less likely to borrow from the Fed, which could mean less money being created through lending. So, I think an increase in the discount rate would actually lead to a decrease in the money supply, not an increase. So, option B probably isn't the right answer.\n\nOption C is the selling of bonds by the Federal Reserve. I remember that when the Fed buys bonds, it's called open-market operations. When they buy bonds, they pay for them with money, which increases the money supply. So, if they're selling bonds, that should be the opposite process. They're getting money from the public in exchange for bonds, which would take money out of circulation, right? So, selling bonds by the Fed should decrease the money supply. So, option C is probably not the answer.\n\nOption D says an increase in the fraction of deposits that must be held by banks. Wait, isn't that similar to the required reserve ratio? Yes, the required reserve ratio is the fraction of deposits that banks must hold. So, if that increases, banks have to hold more money and can lend out less. That should reduce the money supply because less money is being created through lending. So, option D seems like it would lead to a decrease in the money supply, not an increase.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems to be the correct answer because decreasing the required reserve ratio allows banks to lend more, which increases the money supply.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. For example, could the discount rate have an indirect effect on the money supply that I'm not considering? Well, yes, if the discount rate increases, it might not only affect direct borrowing from the Fed but also influence market interest rates. Higher discount rates could lead to higher interest rates in general, which could discourage borrowing and spending, thus reducing the money supply. So, option B is definitely not the right choice for increasing the money supply.\n\nOption C, selling bonds, is part of open-market operations. When the Fed sells bonds, it's taking money out of the economy in exchange for those bonds, which should contractionary, meaning it decreases the money supply. So, that's not the answer either.\n\nOption D, increasing the fraction of deposits that banks must hold, would mean banks have less money to lend out. Less lending means less money created through the multiplier effect, leading to a decrease in the money supply. So, that's also not the right choice.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A: a decrease in the required reserve ratio.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a trick here. Could a decrease in the required reserve ratio lead to a situation where banks become riskier or something? Well, in theory, yes, but the question is specifically about the money supply, not about the stability of the banking system. So, I think it's safe to assume that the immediate effect is an increase in the money supply.\n\nAnother way to think about it is through the money multiplier formula. The money multiplier is 1 divided by the required reserve ratio. So, if the required reserve ratio decreases, the money multiplier increases, which means the money supply increases, all else being equal.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. So, I'm confident that option A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
