                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about tipping in a restaurant. It says that the standard tip is 15% of the bill before tax, and that many people in California find the tip by doubling the sales tax, which is 8.25%. I need to find out by how many cents this method exceeds the standard tip on a bill of $60 before tax. The options are 90, 80, 70, or 60 cents.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. I have a bill of $60 before any tax or tip is added. The standard tip is 15% of this bill. So, I should calculate what 15% of $60 is.\n\nTo calculate 15% of $60, I can think of it as 0.15 times 60. Let me do that multiplication: 0.15 times 60 is 9. So, the standard tip should be $9.00.\n\nNow, the alternative method mentioned is doubling the sales tax, which is 8.25%. So, I need to find out what 8.25% of the bill is and then double it to find the tip amount using this method.\n\nFirst, calculate 8.25% of $60. To find 8.25% of 60, I can convert 8.25% to a decimal, which is 0.0825. Then, multiply 0.0825 by 60.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 0.0825 times 60. Well, 0.08 times 60 is 4.8, and 0.0025 times 60 is 0.15. So, added together, that's 4.95. Therefore, the sales tax amount is $4.95.\n\nNow, according to the method, people double this sales tax to find the tip. So, double of $4.95 is $9.90.\n\nWait a minute, the standard tip is $9.00, and using the doubling method, I get $9.90. So, the doubling method gives a tip that's $0.90 more than the standard tip.\n\nBut the question is asking by how many cents this exceeds the standard tip. Since $0.90 is equal to 90 cents, that would mean it exceeds by 90 cents.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 90, which seems to be the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, standard tip is 15% of $60:\n\n0.15 \u00d7 60 = 9.00\n\nAlternative method: double the sales tax of 8.25%.\n\nSales tax: 8.25% of 60\n\n0.0825 \u00d7 60 = 4.95\n\nDouble that: 4.95 \u00d7 2 = 9.90\n\nDifference: 9.90 - 9.00 = 0.90, which is 90 cents.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that the bill is indeed before tax. The question says \"before tax,\" so I think I'm okay there.\n\nAlso, the question mentions \"before tax,\" so the tip is based on the pre-tax amount, which is $60.\n\nI don't think I need to add any tax to the bill for the tip calculation, as it's based on the pre-tax amount.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is 90 cents.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]"
