                    "text": "So I have this question about the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and it's asking about its effects. There are four options, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that states have been prohibited from establishing voter identification requirements. Hmm, I remember that the Voting Rights Act was primarily aimed at eliminating racial discrimination in voting, especially in areas where there was a history of such practices. While voter ID laws can be controversial and may affect voting access, I don't recall the Voting Rights Act specifically prohibiting states from implementing voter ID requirements. Maybe some states have such laws under other legislation, but generally, this doesn't sound right.\n\nOption B says that voters must now pass literacy tests before voting. Wait a minute, that seems off. I think before the Voting Rights Act, some states, particularly in the South, used literacy tests as a way to disenfranchise African American voters. These tests were often applied in a discriminatory manner. The Voting Rights Act was actually intended to abolish such practices. So, this option seems contrary to the act's purpose. Maybe it's a trick question, but I'm pretty confident that the act didn't introduce literacy tests; rather, it was meant to end them.\n\nOption C states that voting participation for racial minority voters has increased. This seems plausible. The Voting Rights Act was designed to protect the voting rights of all citizens, particularly racial minorities who faced various forms of discrimination at the polls. By outlawing discriminatory voting practices, such as poll taxes and literacy tests, and by providing federal oversight in areas with a history of discrimination, the act likely helped increase voter participation among racial minorities. I think this is a likely answer.\n\nOption D claims that the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18 as a result of the Voting Rights Act. I remember that the voting age was indeed lowered, but I think that was a different piece of legislation. The Voting Rights Act focused on eliminating racial discrimination in voting, whereas the voting age was changed through the Twenty-sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which was ratified in 1971. So, while the voting age was lowered, it wasn't directly due to the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nAfter considering all the options, I believe that the correct answer is Option C: Voting participation for racial minority voters has increased. This aligns with the act's purpose and the historical context in which it was passed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
