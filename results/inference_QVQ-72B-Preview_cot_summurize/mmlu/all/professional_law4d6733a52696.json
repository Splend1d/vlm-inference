                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this negligence case. There's a driver who parked his car in a not-so-great spot near a store, and while he was inside, another driver, a woman, crashed into his car. Now, the driver wants to sue the woman for negligence, but there are some twists here that I need to understand.\n\nFirst off, the driver parked his car where there wasn't a designated parking space, and he left it partially obstructing the road. That sounds like he was being careless, right? Then, the woman approached and crashed into his car, causing damage to both vehicles.\n\nThe question mentions that the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules and that the woman had the last clear chance to avoid the collision. I need to recall what contributory negligence is and how the last clear chance doctrine works in this context.\n\nStarting with contributory negligence: I think it's a legal doctrine where if the plaintiff (the driver in this case) is found to have contributed in any way to the harm that occurred, they can't recover any damages from the defendant (the woman). So, if the driver was negligent in parking his car in an unsafe position, that might bar him from recovering any damages.\n\nBut then there's this concept of the last clear chance. From what I remember, the last clear chance doctrine can sometimes allow a negligent plaintiff to recover damages if the defendant had the last opportunity to avoid the harm but failed to do so. So, even under contributory negligence rules, if the woman had the last clear chance to avoid the collision and didn't, maybe the driver can still recover some damages.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, was the driver negligent? He parked his car in an improper place, partially obstructing the road. That seems like a negligent act because he was careless in where he parked, and it created a hazard for other drivers.\n\nThen, the woman approached and crashed into his car. Was she negligent? Well, if she had the last clear chance to avoid the collision and didn't, that suggests that she might also be negligent.\n\nSo, under contributory negligence rules, because the driver was negligent, he might not be able to recover any damages. But the last clear chance doctrine might change that.\n\nI need to find out how the last clear chance doctrine applies here. I think it means that even if the driver was negligent, if the woman had the last opportunity to avoid the accident but failed to do so, the driver might still be able to recover damages.\n\nLet me see what the typical rules are in such cases.\n\nI recall that under the last clear chance doctrine, if the defendant had the last clear chance to avoid the accident, the court may relieve the plaintiff from the bar of contributory negligence and allow the plaintiff to recover damages.\n\nSo, in this scenario, since the woman had the last clear chance to avoid the collision but didn't, it might mean that the driver can still sue her for negligence and potentially recover damages.\n\nNow, the question is, how much can he recover?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. $5,000, or the full amount of damages to his car.\n\nB. $4,000, or the full amount of his damages, minus the woman's damages.\n\nC. $2,500, or half of his damages.\n\nD. Nothing, because the driver was contributorily negligent for parking his car so that part of it stuck out into the street.\n\nGiven that the last clear chance doctrine might allow the driver to recover damages despite his contributory negligence, option D might not be correct.\n\nOption A suggests he can recover the full $5,000 for his car's damages. But I'm not sure if that's the case because he was also negligent in parking improperly.\n\nOption B says he can recover $4,000, which is his $5,000 in damages minus the woman's $1,000 in damages. I'm not sure about this because typically, in negligence cases, each party pays for their own damages, but there might be some offsetting.\n\nOption C proposes $2,500, which is half of his damages. Maybe this is based on some idea of shared fault.\n\nBut considering the last clear chance doctrine, which seems to place more responsibility on the woman for not avoiding the collision, perhaps the driver can recover the full amount of his damages.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether the woman's negligence is being compared to the driver's negligence.\n\nWait a minute, in some jurisdictions, even with last clear chance, the plaintiff's negligence might still affect the recovery, perhaps reducing it based on the degree of fault.\n\nBut I need to recall specifically how the last clear chance doctrine works under traditional contributory negligence rules.\n\nI think that under the last clear chance doctrine, the plaintiff's contributory negligence is excused, meaning that even if the plaintiff was negligent, if the defendant had the last clear chance to avoid the harm and didn't, the plaintiff can recover fully.\n\nSo, in this case, since the woman had the last clear chance to avoid the collision but didn't, the driver's contributory negligence might be excused, allowing him to recover the full $5,000 for his car's damages.\n\nBut I should also consider whether the woman's damages are relevant here. If the woman is found negligent for crashing into the driver's car, perhaps she is responsible for both her own damages and the driver's damages.\n\nWait, no. Typically, each party is responsible for their own damages, but in negligence cases, the defendant might be ordered to pay for the plaintiff's damages, and vice versa.\n\nBut in this scenario, since the woman had the last clear chance to avoid the collision and didn't, it might be that she is fully responsible for the driver's damages.\n\nSo, the driver could recover $5,000 for his car's damages from the woman.\n\nBut the woman also has $1,000 in damages to her own car. Would the driver have to pay for that? Probably, but that's a separate issue.\n\nIn the lawsuit brought by the driver against the woman, he's seeking damages for his car, which is $5,000.\n\nIf the woman is found negligent due to the last clear chance doctrine, she would have to pay the $5,000.\n\nThe woman's damages would be a separate issue, perhaps pursued by her in a counterclaim or separate lawsuit.\n\nBut in this specific question, it's about the driver suing the woman for negligence, and based on the last clear chance doctrine, he should be able to recover the full $5,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. $5,000, or the full amount of damages to his car.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
