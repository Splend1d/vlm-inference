                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a contract between a computer retailer and a manufacturer. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nIn June, the retailer ordered 100 computers from the manufacturer, and they wanted them delivered by August 1. The order form said that acceptance should be exactly as per the offer\u2014no changes allowed. Then, in July, the manufacturer confirmed the order but added that they'd ship half the computers by August 10 and the other half by August 20. The retailer didn't get the computers by August 1, so they canceled the order. Now, the question is whether the manufacturer can enforce a contract.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall some contract law basics. There's an offer and an acceptance. The acceptance has to mirror the offer exactly, especially when the offer says that acceptance should be only as per the offer terms. That sounds important.\n\nSo, the retailer made an offer to buy 100 computers with specific configurations, and they wanted all of them by August 1. The offer form also said that acceptance should be only on those terms. Then, the manufacturer accepted but proposed to ship the computers in two deliveries, one half by August 10 and the other by August 20. That's different from the original requirement of delivering all by August 1.\n\nNow, this seems like a case of \"battle of the forms.\" Both parties are businesses, and it's a contract for goods, so the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) might apply here.\n\nLet me think about the UCC rules for acceptance of offers between merchants. Under the UCC, if both parties are merchants, an acceptance that includes additional or different terms can still be effective as an acceptance unless the offeror specifies that the offer is accepted only if there's exact compliance with the terms.\n\nIn this case, the order form expressly limited acceptance to the terms of the offer. So, the manufacturer's confirmation that included different shipping terms might not be a valid acceptance under the UCC because the offer required strict compliance with its terms.\n\nWait, but the UCC also has a section about additional terms being considered as proposals for addition to the contract. So, if the offeror doesn't object, those terms can become part of the contract. But in this scenario, the retailer withdrew the order when the computers weren't delivered by August 1, which suggests they didn't agree to the different shipping terms.\n\nAlso, the manufacturer's confirmation came in July, and the original delivery date was August 1. So, there was some time in between. The retailer waited until after August 1 to withdraw the order, which might indicate that they were considering the manufacturer's terms but ultimately decided not to proceed when the delivery didn't happen as originally agreed.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because there was only a minimal difference between the offer and acceptance.\n\nBut the difference in shipping terms seems significant. The retailer wanted all computers by August 1, and the manufacturer offered a split shipment. That's not just a minor difference; it affects the timing and possibly the retailer's plans.\n\nB. Yes, because the retailer assented to the terms by remaining silent until after August 1.\n\nBut silence generally doesn't constitute acceptance, especially under the UCC. The retailer didn't explicitly agree to the new terms; they just waited to see if the computers would be delivered by August 1 and then withdrew the order when they weren't.\n\nC. No, because the offer expressly limited the acceptance to the terms of the offer.\n\nThis seems plausible. Since the offer required that acceptance be only on the offer's terms, the manufacturer's confirmation with different shipping terms might not be a valid acceptance. Therefore, there might not be a contract.\n\nD. No, because the order was withdrawn before the machines were shipped.\n\nWell, the manufacturer hadn't shipped the computers by August 1, and the retailer withdrew the order. If there was no contract due to the acceptance not matching the offer, then the manufacturer might not be able to enforce it.\n\nBut wait, maybe the manufacturer relied on the retailer's order and prepared the shipment, and now they're trying to enforce the contract. However, if there was no valid acceptance, then there's no contract to enforce.\n\nI think option C is the most accurate answer here. The offer expressly limited acceptance to the terms of the offer, and the manufacturer's confirmation included different shipping terms, which effectively made it a counteroffer. Since the retailer didn't agree to those new terms and withdrew the order when the original delivery date wasn't met, there's no enforceable contract.\n\nSo, the manufacturer will not prevail in enforcing a contract because the acceptance didn't match the offer, and the offer expressly limited acceptance to its terms.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
