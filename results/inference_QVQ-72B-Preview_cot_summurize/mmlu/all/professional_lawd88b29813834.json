With every prescription of this drug distributed, the company inserted a written warning, which stated:\"Use of this drug may cause dizziness. \"In accordance with the prescription, the plaintiff received a four-day supply of the drug from his neighborhood pharmacy, which passed along the warning to the plaintiff. After two days, the plaintiff felt much better and went back to work at a home improvement store, where he was the manager. The plaintiff continued to take the drug until his supply was exhausted. On the fourth day, the plaintiff took his final capsule at 2:00 p. m. While he was driving his car home at 5:45 that afternoon, he became dizzy and crashed into a tree. As a result, he received multiple injuries. The plaintiff decided to consult an attorney, who filed a lawsuit on the plaintiff's behalf against the pharmaceutical company, alleging that the company was responsible for the accident and resulting injuries on the theories of negligence and strict liability. At trial, the plaintiff's attorney attempts to introduce evidence that subsequent to this accident, the company expanded its warning to read: \"Use of this drug may cause dizziness. Do not drive for five hours after use. \"Such evidence is\n\nA. admissible as an indication that the company did not use due care in wording its original warning.\nB. admissible as a declaration against interest, to prove the possibility of alternate warnings.\nC. inadmissible to show that the company was negligent in wording its original warning.\nD. inadmissible, because the subsequent warning is not relevant to the feasibility of a modified warning.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out which option is correct regarding the admissibility of certain evidence in court. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a plaintiff who was prescribed a drug for a respiratory infection. The drug came with a warning that said, \"Use of this drug may cause dizziness.\" The plaintiff got the prescription from his pharmacy, and they passed along the warning. After feeling better, he went back to work and continued taking the drug. On the fourth day, he took his last capsule at 2:00 p.m., and while driving home at 5:45 p.m., he became dizzy and crashed into a tree, getting injured.\n\nNow, the plaintiff's lawyer is suing the pharmaceutical company that made the drug, claiming they are responsible for the accident and injuries based on negligence and strict liability. At trial, the plaintiff's attorney wants to introduce evidence that after this accident, the company changed its warning to say, \"Use of this drug may cause dizziness. Do not drive for five hours after use.\"\n\nThe question is about whether this subsequent warning can be admitted as evidence, and for what purpose. The options are:\n\nA. Admissible as an indication that the company did not use due care in wording its original warning.\n\nB. Admissible as a declaration against interest, to prove the possibility of alternate warnings.\n\nC. Inadmissible to show that the company was negligent in wording its original warning.\n\nD. Inadmissible, because the subsequent warning is not relevant to the feasibility of a modified warning.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about the rules of evidence here, particularly regarding subsequent remedial measures.\n\nI recall that generally, evidence of subsequent remedial measures is not admissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct in connection with the event involving the injury or damage. This is because allowing such evidence could discourage companies from making safety improvements after an accident for fear of admitting liability.\n\nSo, if the plaintiff is trying to use the fact that the company changed its warning to prove that the original warning was negligent, that might be inadmissible under this rule.\n\nBut, there are exceptions to this rule. For example, subsequent changes can be admissible for purposes other than proving negligence, like to show feasibility of a precautionary measure if contested, or to impeach a witness's testimony.\n\nIn this case, option A suggests that it's admissible to show the company didn't use due care in the original warning. That sounds like it's being used to prove negligence, which is typically not allowed under the subsequent remedial measures rule.\n\nOption B says it's admissible as a declaration against interest to prove the possibility of alternate warnings. A declaration against interest is a statement that, at the time it was made, was against the declarant's own interest. I'm not sure if the subsequent warning change qualifies as a declaration against interest. It's more of an action than a statement, and it was done by the company, not necessarily as an admission of fault.\n\nOption C says it's inadmissible to show negligence in the original warning. This aligns with the general rule against admitting subsequent remedial measures to prove negligence.\n\nOption D says it's inadmissible because the subsequent warning isn't relevant to the feasibility of a modified warning. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. If the feasibility of a modified warning is in question, and the company implemented a stronger warning later, that might actually be relevant to show that a stronger warning was feasible at the time of the accident.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the company's subsequent action of strengthening the warning could be used to show that a stronger warning was feasible, which might be relevant to the case if the plaintiff is arguing that the original warning wasn't sufficient and that a stronger warning was feasible and should have been used.\n\nBut, I think there's a rule that allows subsequent remedial measures to be admitted to show feasibility if that's being contested. So, if the defendant is claiming that a stronger warning wasn't feasible at the time of the accident, and the plaintiff can show that the company implemented such a warning later, that might be admissible to show that it was feasible all along.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, it's not clear whether the feasibility of a stronger warning is being contested. Maybe the company acknowledges that a stronger warning was feasible but argues that the original warning was sufficient.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the plaintiff's attorney is trying to use the subsequent warning as evidence that the original warning was insufficient, which would be akin to admitting subsequent remedial measures to prove negligence, which is generally inadmissible.\n\nAlternatively, if the plaintiff is using it to show that a stronger warning was feasible, and the company knew it, that might be a different matter.\n\nBut, based on the options provided, it seems like the main debate is around whether this evidence is admissible to prove negligence.\n\nLet me look back at the question: \"Such evidence is...\"\n\nAnd the options are about admissibility in relation to the company's due care in wording the original warning.\n\nGiven that, and considering the general rules against admitting subsequent remedial measures to prove negligence, I think option C is the correct answer: inadmissible to show that the company was negligent in wording its original warning.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether there's an exception that allows this evidence to be admitted for another purpose, like showing feasibility.\n\nIf the company is arguing that a stronger warning wasn't feasible at the time of the accident, then perhaps the plaintiff could introduce evidence of the subsequent warning to show that it was feasible.\n\nBut, without knowing whether feasibility is being contested or not, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven that, and based on the information provided, I'll go with option C: inadmissible to show that the company was negligent in wording its original warning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
