                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out what would happen if the mortgage company sues the daughter for the money owed on the mortgage after the borrower defaults. Let me try to understand all the steps that have happened.\n\nFirst, in 1993, someone borrows money and mortgages a ranch to a mortgage company to secure a $25,000 note, which is due by the end of that year with 9.5% interest. So, the borrower is obligated to pay back the money plus interest by December 31, 1993.\n\nBut, in 1996, the mortgage company records the mortgage on the ranch. I think recording a mortgage is like making it official in public records, which probably helps protect the mortgage company's interest in the property.\n\nThen, in 2007, the borrower signs a document and gives it to his daughter, promising to give her the ranch by a quitclaim deed and to pay off the mortgage debt when it's due.\n\nFinally, in 2008, the borrower gives the daughter a quitclaim deed, but it doesn't mention the mortgage at all.\n\nNow, if the borrower defaults on the mortgage, meaning he doesn't pay back the money, and the mortgage company sues the daughter to recover the amount due, what are the chances the mortgage company will succeed?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Succeed because the mortgage company is a third-party beneficiary of the agreement between the borrower and the daughter.\n\nB. Succeed because there was an implied delegation of duties to the daughter.\n\nC. Not succeed because the daughter didn't promise to pay the mortgage debt.\n\nD. Not succeed because the law doesn't allow the mortgagor to delegate duties under this type of property transfer.\n\nHmm, I need to think through this.\n\nFirst, a quitclaim deed typically transfers whatever interest the grantor has in the property to the grantee, but it doesn't guarantee that there are no liens or encumbrances on the property. In this case, there's a mortgage on the ranch.\n\nSo, when the borrower gives the daughter a quitclaim deed, he's transferring his interest in the ranch to her, but the mortgage still exists and is likely to remain a lien on the property unless paid off.\n\nBut the question is about an in personam action against the daughter to recover the debt, not a foreclosure action against the property.\n\nAn in personam action is one where they're trying to collect the debt from the daughter personally, not just going after the property.\n\nSo, does the daughter have any obligation to pay the mortgage debt?\n\nFrom the information given, the borrower promised to convey the ranch to the daughter and to pay the mortgage debt when it came due. But he gave her a quitclaim deed, which didn't mention the mortgage.\n\nDid the daughter agree to take on the mortgage debt? The promise to pay the debt was from the borrower to the daughter, not the other way around.\n\nWait, the borrower promised to pay the debt, but he defaulted. So, the mortgage company is trying to make the daughter pay.\n\nBut did the daughter agree to pay the debt? It doesn't seem like it. She received a quitclaim deed, which didn't mention assuming the mortgage.\n\nIn general, when someone takes a quitclaim deed, they're getting whatever interest the grantor has, but unless they agree to assume the mortgage, they're not automatically responsible for the debt.\n\nSo, option C seems plausible: the mortgage company wouldn't succeed because the daughter didn't promise to pay the mortgage debt.\n\nOption D suggests that the law doesn't permit delegation under these circumstances. I'm not sure about that. Generally, debts can be assigned or delegated, but it usually requires the consent of the creditor and possibly the debtor.\n\nBut in this case, it's not clear that there was any delegation from the borrower to the daughter regarding the mortgage debt.\n\nOption A says the mortgage company is a third-party beneficiary of the agreement between the borrower and the daughter. But the agreement was that the borrower would convey the ranch to the daughter and pay the mortgage debt. The mortgage company wasn't a party to that agreement, so I don't think they can claim to be a third-party beneficiary.\n\nOption B talks about an implied delegation of duties to the daughter. I'm not sure about that. Delegation usually requires explicit agreement, not implication.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the answer is C: the mortgage company will probably not succeed because the daughter didn't promise to pay the mortgage debt.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the borrower conveyed the ranch to the daughter via a quitclaim deed without any mention of assuming the mortgage, and there's no other agreement where the daughter agreed to take on the mortgage debt, then she shouldn't be personally liable for it.\n\nThe mortgage company would likely have to pursue the borrower for the debt, perhaps by foreclosing on the ranch or other assets of the borrower.\n\nBut since the daughter didn't agree to assume the debt, she shouldn't be personally on the hook for it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
