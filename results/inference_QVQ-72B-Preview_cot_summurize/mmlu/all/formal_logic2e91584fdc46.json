                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to construct a truth table for the given argument and then determine if the argument is valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I have to pick a counterexample from the options provided.\n\nFirst, let's understand the argument. It has two premises and a conclusion:\n\n1. Q \u2261 R (Q is equivalent to R)\n\n2. ~ (S \u2228 Q) (not S or Q)\n\nAnd the conclusion is R.\n\nSo, the argument is:\n\nQ \u2261 R\n\n~(S \u2228 Q)\n\nTherefore, R\n\nI need to make a truth table for these propositions: Q, R, S.\n\nSince there are three variables, the truth table will have 2^3 = 8 rows.\n\nLet's list all possible truth value combinations for Q, R, and S:\n\n1. Q: T, R: T, S: T\n\n2. Q: T, R: T, S: F\n\n3. Q: T, R: F, S: T\n\n4. Q: T, R: F, S: F\n\n5. Q: F, R: T, S: T\n\n6. Q: F, R: T, S: F\n\n7. Q: F, R: F, S: T\n\n8. Q: F, R: F, S: F\n\nNow, for each row, I need to evaluate the premises and the conclusion.\n\nFirst premise: Q \u2261 R\n\nThat's a biconditional, so it's true when Q and R have the same truth value, and false otherwise.\n\nSecond premise: ~ (S \u2228 Q)\n\nThis is the negation of the disjunction of S and Q. So, S \u2228 Q is true when S is true or Q is true or both. The negation is true only when both S and Q are false.\n\nThe conclusion is R.\n\nLet's fill in the truth table:\n\nRow | Q | R | S | Q \u2261 R | ~ (S \u2228 Q) | R\n\n1. T | T | T | T | T | F | T\n\n2. T | T | T | F | T | F | T\n\n3. T | F | T | T | F | F | T\n\n4. T | F | F | F | F | T | F\n\n5. F | T | T | T | F | F | T\n\n6. F | T | T | F | F | F | T\n\n7. F | F | F | T | T | F | F\n\n8. F | F | F | F | T | T | F\n\nNow, the argument is:\n\nQ \u2261 R\n\n~(S \u2228 Q)\n\nTherefore, R\n\nIn the truth table, we look for rows where both premises are true and see if the conclusion is also true.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Q \u2261 R is true, ~ (S \u2228 Q) is false \u2192 conclusion R is true\n\n- Row 2: Q \u2261 R is true, ~ (S \u2228 Q) is false \u2192 conclusion R is true\n\n- Row 3: Q \u2261 R is false, ~ (S \u2228 Q) is false \u2192 premises not both true\n\n- Row 4: Q \u2261 R is false, ~ (S \u2228 Q) is true \u2192 premises not both true\n\n- Row 5: Q \u2261 R is false, ~ (S \u2228 Q) is false \u2192 premises not both true\n\n- Row 6: Q \u2261 R is false, ~ (S \u2228 Q) is false \u2192 premises not both true\n\n- Row 7: Q \u2261 R is true, ~ (S \u2228 Q) is false \u2192 conclusion R is false\n\n- Row 8: Q \u2261 R is true, ~ (S \u2228 Q) is true \u2192 conclusion R is false\n\nWait a minute, in rows where both premises are true, what happens to the conclusion?\n\nIn row 1: both premises true, conclusion true\n\nIn row 2: both premises true, conclusion true\n\nIn row 7: both premises true, conclusion false\n\nIn row 8: both premises true, conclusion false\n\nSo, in rows 7 and 8, when both premises are true, the conclusion is false.\n\nThis means the argument is invalid because there are cases where the premises are true and the conclusion is false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nNow, I need to choose a counterexample from the options provided.\n\nOption B: Invalid. Counterexample when Q and S are true and R is false.\n\nLooking at the truth table, is there a row where Q is true, S is true, R is false?\n\nLooking at row 3: Q true, R false, S true. But in row 3, Q \u2261 R is false, ~ (S \u2228 Q) is false. So, both premises are not true.\n\nOption C: Invalid. Counterexample when Q is true and S and R are false.\n\nLooking at row 4: Q true, R false, S false. Q \u2261 R is false, ~ (S \u2228 Q) is true. So, first premise is false.\n\nOption D: Invalid. Counterexample when Q, S, and R are false.\n\nLooking at row 8: Q false, R false, S false. Q \u2261 R is true, ~ (S \u2228 Q) is true. So, both premises are true, but conclusion is false.\n\nWait, but in row 8, Q is false, R is false, S is false. Q \u2261 R is true (since both are false), ~ (S \u2228 Q) is true (since both S and Q are false), and R is false.\n\nSo, both premises are true, and conclusion is false. This is a counterexample.\n\nBut looking back, in row 7: Q false, R false, S true. Q \u2261 R is true, ~ (S \u2228 Q) is false. So, second premise is false.\n\nSo, only row 8 fits both premises true and conclusion false.\n\nOption B suggests Q true, S true, R false. But in row 3, Q \u2261 R is false, ~ (S \u2228 Q) is false. So, neither premise is true.\n\nOption C suggests Q true, S false, R false. In row 4: Q \u2261 R is false, ~ (S \u2228 Q) is true. So, first premise is false.\n\nOption D suggests Q false, S false, R false. In row 8: both premises true, conclusion false. This is a valid counterexample.\n\nBut wait, is there another counterexample in the options?\n\nLooking back, in row 7: Q false, R false, S true. Q \u2261 R is true, ~ (S \u2228 Q) is false. So, second premise is false.\n\nSo, only row 8 has both premises true and conclusion false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: Invalid. Counterexample when Q, S, and R are false.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any row where Q is true, S is true, R is false, and both premises are true?\n\nLooking at row 3: Q true, R false, S true. Q \u2261 R is false, ~ (S \u2228 Q) is false. So, neither premise is true.\n\nSimilarly, for option C: Q true, S false, R false. That would be row 4: Q true, R false, S false. Q \u2261 R is false, ~ (S \u2228 Q) is true. So, first premise is false.\n\nOption D: Q false, S false, R false. Row 8: Q \u2261 R is true, ~ (S \u2228 Q) is true. Both premises true, conclusion is false.\n\nTherefore, D is the correct counterexample.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
