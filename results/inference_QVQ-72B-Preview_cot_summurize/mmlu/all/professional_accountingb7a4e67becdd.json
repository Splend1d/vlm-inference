                    "text": "So I have this inventory problem for Cobb Inc., and I need to find the weighted average cost of goods sold for May using the periodic inventory method. Let me try to understand what's going on here.\n\nFirst, the beginning inventory on May 1 is 200 units with a total cost of $1,250. Then there are purchases on May 4 of 20 units at $5.80 each, and on May 17 of 80 units at $5.50 each. There's a sale on May 14 of 10 units for $120, but since we're using the periodic inventory method, I think I don't need to worry about the cost of goods sold until the end of the month. Am I right?\n\nOkay, so with the periodic inventory method, we calculate the cost of goods sold at the end of the period, not at the time of each sale. So, I need to find the total cost of goods available for sale and then subtract the ending inventory to find the cost of goods sold.\n\nFirst, let's find the total units available for sale. Starting with 200 units, plus 20 units purchased on May 4, and 80 units purchased on May 17. So, total units available for sale are 200 + 20 + 80 = 300 units.\n\nNext, I need to find the total cost of these 300 units. The beginning inventory is $1,250. The purchases are $116 on May 4 (20 units * $5.80) and $440 on May 17 (80 units * $5.50). So, total cost is $1,250 + $116 + $440 = $1,806.\n\nNow, the weighted average cost per unit is the total cost divided by the total units available for sale. So, $1,806 divided by 300 units equals $6.02 per unit.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the cost of goods sold for May. Assuming that all units sold were from the available units, and if 10 units were sold on May 14, then the cost of goods sold would be 10 units times the average cost per unit, which is 10 * $6.02 = $60.20.\n\nBut hold on, the answer choices include $60.20, but also $62.10, $62.50, and $65. Did I do something wrong?\n\nLet me double-check. Maybe I need to consider the entire month's sales, not just the one sale on May 14. Wait, the problem says there was a sale of 10 units on May 14 for $120, but it doesn't mention any other sales. So, perhaps that's the only sale for the month.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the sale on May 14 was before some of the purchases, so the cost of goods sold might be calculated differently.\n\nLet me see. The beginning inventory is 200 units at $1,250, which is an average cost of $1,250 / 200 = $6.25 per unit.\n\nOn May 4, 20 units are purchased at $5.80 each, total $116.\n\nOn May 17, 80 units are purchased at $5.50 each, total $440.\n\nSale on May 14 is 10 units.\n\nSo, at the time of the sale on May 14, the inventory consists of the beginning inventory of 200 units plus the 20 units purchased on May 4, totaling 220 units.\n\nWait, but in periodic inventory, we don't track each transaction, so perhaps I should just stick with the total units and total cost.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the weighted average cost after each purchase and then apply it to the sales.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me try to recall how the periodic inventory method works.\n\nIn periodic inventory, the cost of goods sold is determined at the end of the period by subtracting the ending inventory from the goods available for sale. Goods available for sale are the beginning inventory plus net purchases.\n\nSo, in this case, goods available for sale are 200 units beginning inventory plus 20 units purchased on May 4 plus 80 units purchased on May 17, totaling 300 units, with a total cost of $1,806.\n\nIf 10 units were sold, then the ending inventory would be 300 - 10 = 290 units.\n\nTherefore, the cost of goods sold would be 10 units times the average cost per unit, which is $6.02 per unit, totaling $60.20.\n\nBut again, that seems straightforward, and the answer choice includes $60.20, but I'm wondering if there's more to it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to calculate the weighted average cost per unit based on the units available at the time of the sale.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nOn May 14, when the sale occurs, the available units are the beginning inventory of 200 units plus the 20 units purchased on May 4, totaling 220 units.\n\nThe cost of these 220 units is $1,250 (beginning inventory) plus $116 (purchase on May 4), totaling $1,366.\n\nSo, the average cost per unit at that time is $1,366 / 220 units = $6.21 per unit.\n\nTherefore, the cost of goods sold for the 10 units sold on May 14 would be 10 * $6.21 = $62.10.\n\nWait a minute, that's one of the answer choices. Maybe that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the periodic inventory method doesn't track inventory on a daily basis, so I should calculate the weighted average for the entire period.\n\nIn that case, using the total units available for sale, which is 300 units with a total cost of $1,806, the average cost is $6.02 per unit, and the cost of goods sold for 10 units is $60.20.\n\nBut since the problem specifies that the sale was on May 14, before the second purchase on May 17, maybe I need to consider the inventory position at the time of the sale.\n\nI'm getting conflicting thoughts here. On one hand, the periodic method doesn't consider the timing of purchases and sales, but on the other hand, the sale occurred before the second purchase.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to calculate the weighted average cost based on the units available at the time of the sale.\n\nSo, as of May 14, available units are 200 (beginning inventory) plus 20 (purchased on May 4), totaling 220 units with a total cost of $1,250 + $116 = $1,366.\n\nAverage cost per unit is $1,366 / 220 = $6.21 per unit.\n\nTherefore, cost of goods sold for 10 units is 10 * $6.21 = $62.10.\n\nThat seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire period, the average cost is $6.02 per unit, and cost of goods sold is 10 * $6.02 = $60.20.\n\nBut I think the more accurate approach is to consider the inventory available at the time of the sale, especially since the periodic method doesn't account for inventory on a perpetual basis.\n\nHowever, in practice, with the periodic inventory method, companies typically calculate the weighted average cost based on the entire period's available units, not considering the timing of sales and purchases within the period.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is $60.20.\n\nBut since the problem mentions that Cobb uses the periodic inventory method, and the sale occurred before the second purchase, perhaps the teacher expects us to calculate the weighted average based on the units available at the time of the sale.\n\nIn that case, $62.10 would be the answer.\n\nI'm really torn here. Maybe I should look up how the periodic inventory method handles cost of goods sold in relation to the timing of purchases and sales.\n\nAfter a quick search in my notes, I recall that in the periodic inventory system, the cost of goods sold is determined at the end of the period based on the total units available for sale and the units on hand at the end of the period.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the total units available for sale are 300 units with a total cost of $1,806, and the cost per unit is $6.02.\n\nTherefore, the cost of goods sold for the 10 units sold would be 10 * $6.02 = $60.20.\n\nI think my initial inclination was correct. Even though the sale occurred before the second purchase, in the periodic system, we don't track inventory levels at specific points in time; we calculate based on the entire period's activity.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $60.20.\n\nI'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 60.20} \\]"
