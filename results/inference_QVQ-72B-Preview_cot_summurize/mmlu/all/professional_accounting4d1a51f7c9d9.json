                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this auditing scenario. The auditor is using statistical sampling to check if cash disbursements are properly authorized. From the sample results, the sample rate of deviation plus the allowance for sampling risk exceeds the tolerable rate. I need to figure out what this means and how it affects the auditor's plans.\n\nFirst, let's break down some terms:\n\n- **Sample rate of deviation:** This is the percentage of items in the sample that show deviations from the prescribed controls. So, in this case, it's the percentage of cash disbursements in the sample that were not properly authorized.\n\n- **Allowance for sampling risk:** This is an adjustment made to the sample results to account for the possibility that the sample isn't perfectly representative of the entire population. It's like a margin of error based on the sample size and the desired confidence level.\n\n- **Tolerable rate:** This is the maximum rate of deviation from the controls that the auditor is willing to accept. It's set based on what the auditor considers acceptable for the control to still be effective.\n\nSo, if the sum of the sample rate of deviation and the allowance for sampling risk exceeds the tolerable rate, it means that the auditor cannot be confident that the actual population deviation rate is below the tolerable level. In other words, there's a higher risk that the controls over cash disbursements aren't working as well as needed.\n\nNow, I need to see how this affects the auditor's plans:\n\nA. Planned reliance on the prescribed control.\n\nB. Assessed level of control risk.\n\nC. Planned reliance on substantive tests.\n\nD. Tolerable rate of deviations.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n**A. Planned reliance on the prescribed control.**\n\n- If the controls are not operating effectively (as suggested by the sample results), the auditor should reduce reliance on these controls. This makes sense because if controls aren't working well, they can't be trusted to prevent or detect errors or frauds.\n\n**B. Assessed level of control risk.**\n\n- Control risk is the risk that a material misstatement that could occur in a financial statement assertion will not be prevented or detected and corrected by the entity's internal control. If the auditor finds that controls are weaker than expected, they should assess control risk higher.\n\n- However, the way this option is phrased is a bit confusing. It says \"reduce the assessed level of control risk.\" But logically, if controls are weaker, the auditor should increase the assessed level of control risk, not reduce it.\n\n**C. Planned reliance on substantive tests.**\n\n- Substantive tests are procedures performed directly on transaction details or account balances to detect material misstatements. If controls are weaker, the auditor might need to perform more substantive testing to gather enough evidence about the financial statements.\n\n- But the option says \"reduce the planned reliance on substantive tests.\" That would suggest doing fewer substantive tests, which doesn't align with the idea that controls are weaker.\n\n**D. Tolerable rate of deviations.**\n\n- The tolerable rate is set based on the auditor's assessment of control risk and other factors. It's not typically something that's adjusted based on sample results. Instead, if the sample results indicate higher deviation rates, it might suggest that the initially set tolerable rate was too low, but auditors don't usually adjust tolerable rates mid-audit based on sample results.\n\nGiven this analysis, option A seems the most appropriate answer. If the controls aren't performing as expected, the auditor should reduce reliance on those controls.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn audit sampling for controls, if the sample results indicate that the deviation rate plus the allowance for sampling risk exceeds the tolerable rate, it means that the auditor has less assurance that the control is operating effectively. Therefore, the auditor should consider reducing reliance on that control.\n\nOption B suggests reducing the assessed level of control risk, but actually, if controls are weaker, the auditor should increase the assessed level of control risk.\n\nOption C suggests reducing reliance on substantive tests, but in reality, if controls are weaker, the auditor might need to perform more substantive testing to compensate for the lack of reliance on controls.\n\nOption D suggests reducing the tolerable rate of deviations, but the tolerable rate is set based on the auditor's initial assessment and isn't typically adjusted based on sample results.\n\nTherefore, the most logical answer is A: planned reliance on the prescribed control.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
