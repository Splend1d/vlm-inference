                    "text": "So I've got this question about sarcomeres in striated muscle, like skeletal muscle. There are four options, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me go through each one carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"During contraction H zones become elongated.\" Hmm, I remember that in a sarcomere, the H zone is the central part of the A band where only thick filaments are present. During contraction, the thin filaments slide past the thick filaments, and I think the H zone actually becomes narrower because the thin filaments from both sides move towards the center. So, I don't think it becomes elongated; rather, it shortens. Maybe I should double-check that.\n\nOption B: \"In the relaxed position, tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to the binding site of actin.\" Okay, this sounds familiar. In the relaxed state, tropomyosin, which is a protein associated with actin filaments, blocks the binding sites on actin that myosin would normally attach to. This prevents contraction from happening until calcium ions bind to troponin, which then moves tropomyosin out of the way. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption C: \"Each myosin helical tail contains an actin-binding site and an ATP-hydrolyzing site.\" Wait a minute, myosin has a head and a tail. The heads are responsible for binding to actin and hydrolyzing ATP. Actually, the heads have the binding sites for actin and ATP. The tail is more involved in forming the thick filaments. So, I think it's the heads, not the tails, that have the actin-binding and ATPase sites. Therefore, this statement is probably incorrect.\n\nOption D: \"The proteins troponin and tropomyosin constitute the thick and thin filaments, respectively.\" No, that doesn't sound right. Troponin and tropomyosin are both found on the thin filaments; troponin is involved in regulating contraction by binding to tropomyosin and calcium ions. Tropomyosin is a protein that runs along the actin filaments. The thick filaments are primarily made up of myosin molecules. So, this statement is misleading because troponin and tropomyosin are both part of the thin filaments, but they don't constitute the entire thin filament. Actin is also a major component.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems that option B is the correct answer. Let me just make sure I'm not missing something. In the relaxed state, tropomyosin does indeed block the binding sites on actin, preventing myosin from attaching. This inhibition is lifted when calcium binds to troponin, causing a conformational change that moves tropomyosin away from the binding sites, allowing myosin to attach and initiate contraction.\n\nYeah, I'm confident that option B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
