Nerve center, D. Synapse.\"\n\nAlright, I need to figure out which one of these is the point where a signal jumps from one nerve cell to another. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall the basic structure of a neuron. A neuron has a cell body, dendrites, an axon, and terminal buttons. The dendrites receive signals from other neurons, and the axon transmits the signal away from the cell body to other neurons or target cells.\n\nNow, the point where one neuron communicates with another is called a synapse. That sounds promising. So, option D is synapse. But let me make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nOption A is dendrite. Dendrites receive signals from other neurons, but they don't typically transmit the signal to another neuron directly. They pass the signal to the cell body, which then sends it down the axon to the synapse.\n\nOption B is glial cell. I remember that glial cells are support cells in the nervous system. They provide structure, insulation, and help in the healing process after injury. But they don't transmit impulses from one neuron to another.\n\nOption C is nerve center. Hmm, that's a bit vague. A nerve center could refer to a group of neurons located in the central nervous system, like the brain or spinal cord, that process information. But it's not a specific point where impulses are transmitted from one neuron to another.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option D, the synapse, is the correct answer. The synapse is the specialized gap between the axon terminal of one neuron and the dendrite or cell body of another neuron. When an action potential reaches the end of the axon, it releases neurotransmitters into the synapse, which then bind to receptors on the receiving neuron,\u4f20\u9012 the signal.\n\nLet me double-check this understanding. Is there any chance that another option could be considered correct in certain contexts?\n\nFor example, sometimes, neurons can connect directly via gap junctions, which allow electrical signals to pass directly from one cell to another without releasing neurotransmitters. But these are more exceptions than the rule, and in most cases, synaptic transmission involves the release of neurotransmitters into a synapse.\n\nAlso, in some neural circuits, dendrites can communicate with each other, but again, this is through synapses.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to say that the synapse is the primary point where an impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other component or structure that might be involved in direct signal transmission between neurons. But I can't think of any at the moment that would override the role of the synapse.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Synapse.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
