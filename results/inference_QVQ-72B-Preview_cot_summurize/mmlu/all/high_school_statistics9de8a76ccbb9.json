                    "text": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. I'm given that P(A) = 0.3 and P(B) = 0.2, and I need to find P(A \u222a B) under three different conditions: when A and B are mutually exclusive, when they're independent, and when B is a subset of A.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what P(A \u222a B) represents. It's the probability that either event A or event B occurs, or both. The formula for this is:\n\nP(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B)\n\nwhere P(A \u2229 B) is the probability that both A and B occur.\n\nSo, the key here is to find P(A \u2229 B) under each of these conditions.\n\n**Case 1: A and B are mutually exclusive.**\n\nMutually exclusive means that if A happens, B cannot happen, and vice versa. So, P(A \u2229 B) = 0 because they can't occur at the same time.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nP(A \u222a B) = 0.3 + 0.2 - 0 = 0.5\n\n**Case 2: A and B are independent.**\n\nIndependence means that the occurrence of one event doesn't affect the occurrence of the other. The formula for independent events is:\n\nP(A \u2229 B) = P(A) * P(B)\n\nSo, P(A \u2229 B) = 0.3 * 0.2 = 0.06\n\nThen, P(A \u222a B) = 0.3 + 0.2 - 0.06 = 0.44\n\n**Case 3: B is a subset of A.**\n\nIf B is a subset of A, that means every time B occurs, A also occurs. So, B is contained within A. Therefore, P(A \u2229 B) = P(B), because whenever B happens, A is also happening.\n\nSo, P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(B) = P(A) + 0 = 0.3 + 0.2 - 0.2 = 0.3\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me think again.\n\nIf B is a subset of A, then A \u2229 B is just B, because only B's elements are in both A and B. Therefore, P(A \u2229 B) = P(B).\n\nSo, P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(B) = P(A) = 0.3\n\nBut looking back at the options, option B seems to match this:\n\nA. 0.44, 0.5, 0.2\n\nB. 0.44, 0.5, 0.3\n\nC. 0.5, 0.44, 0.2\n\nD. 0.5, 0.44, 0.3\n\nWait, all options have 0.44 and 0.5 in some order, but according to my calculations, it should be:\n\nMutually exclusive: 0.5\n\nIndependent: 0.44\n\nB subset of A: 0.3\n\nLooking at the options, that would correspond to option B: 0.44, 0.5, 0.3\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nFirst, mutually exclusive: P(A \u222a B) = 0.3 + 0.2 - 0 = 0.5\n\nIndependent: P(A \u222a B) = 0.3 + 0.2 - (0.3*0.2) = 0.3 + 0.2 - 0.06 = 0.44\n\nB subset of A: P(A \u222a B) = P(A) = 0.3\n\nYes, that matches option B.\n\nI think I might have misread the options initially. So, the correct answer should be option B: 0.44, 0.5, 0.3\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
