                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a ball of mass m being tossed upward to reach a height of 20 meters. The question is asking for the net force on the ball at the 10-meter position, halfway up. And we're to assume there's no air resistance.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Newton's second law, which states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the object's mass multiplied by its acceleration. In mathematical terms, F_net = m * a.\n\nIn this problem, we're dealing with a ball moving vertically, and the only force acting on it (since there's no air resistance) is gravity. Gravity exerts a downward force on the ball, and its magnitude is F_gravity = m * g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2 on Earth).\n\nNow, at any point during the ball's flight, whether it's going up or down, the only force acting on it is gravity. So, regardless of its position, the net force should always be F_net = -m * g, where the negative sign indicates the downward direction.\n\nBut wait a minute, the problem mentions \"net force\" and gives options like 2mg, mg, mg/2, and mg/4. All these options are positive, which might suggest that they're considering only the magnitude of the force. However, it's important to keep track of directions in physics problems.\n\nLet me think again. If the ball is being tossed upward, at the 10-meter position, which is halfway up to 20 meters, the force of gravity is still acting downward with a magnitude of mg. So, the net force should be -mg, meaning mg downward.\n\nBut the options are all positive, which makes me think that they might be considering the magnitude only, ignoring the direction. But that doesn't seem right, because force is a vector quantity and direction matters.\n\nMaybe the problem is assuming a coordinate system where upward is positive, and downward is negative, and they're just listing the magnitude. But that seems a bit unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another force acting on the ball that I'm not considering. For example, if someone is applying an upward force to keep the ball moving up, but the problem says it's being \"tossed upward,\" which implies that it's been given an initial velocity and then only gravity acts on it.\n\nAssuming no other forces are acting, the net force should just be the force of gravity, which is mg downward.\n\nWait, maybe there's something about the 10-meter position that affects the gravitational force. Does gravity change with height?\n\nWell, yes, gravity does decrease with distance from the Earth's center. The gravitational force is given by F = G * (m1 * m2) / r\u00b2, where r is the distance from the center of the Earth.\n\nBut in this problem, the height is only 20 meters, which is negligible compared to the Earth's radius of about 6,371,000 meters. So, the change in gravitational force over that small height is minimal and can be considered negligible for practical purposes.\n\nTherefore, the gravitational force remains essentially constant at mg, regardless of the height within this range.\n\nSo, at the 10-meter position, the net force should still be mg downward.\n\nBut looking back at the options, all are positive multiples of mg, without considering direction. Perhaps the problem is expecting the magnitude of the net force, not its direction.\n\nIf that's the case, then the magnitude of the net force is mg.\n\nBut let's see if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nMaybe considering the reaction force from the toss. But no, once the ball leaves the thrower's hand, the only force acting on it is gravity (assuming no air resistance).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's some centripetal force involved, but that's more relevant for circular motion, and the ball is moving vertically upward and downward.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the net force is being calculated considering the normal force or something else, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement. It says, \"At the 10-m position half way up the net force on the ball is...\"\n\nWait, maybe it's referring to the net force including the reaction from the toss, but that seems unlikely because the ball has already been tossed and is now in flight.\n\nNo, I think the initial toss provides the ball with an upward velocity, and then only gravity acts on it during its flight.\n\nTherefore, the net force should be mg downward, so its magnitude is mg.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 2mg\n\nB. mg\n\nC. mg/2\n\nD. mg/4\n\nGiven that only gravity is acting, and its magnitude is mg, the correct answer should be B. mg.\n\nBut wait, why is option A 2mg? Is there a scenario where the net force could be 2mg?\n\nWell, if there were two forces, each of mg acting in the same direction, then the net force would be 2mg. But in this scenario, only gravity is acting, so that doesn't make sense.\n\nOption C is mg/2, which might be relevant if the gravitational force decreases significantly with height, but as I previously thought, over 10 meters, that's negligible.\n\nOption D is mg/4, which also doesn't seem applicable here.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable answer is B. mg.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the work-energy principle. The work done by the net force equals the change in kinetic energy.\n\nIf the net force is mg, and it acts over a distance of 10 meters, the work done would be mg * 10 meters, which would equal the change in kinetic energy.\n\nBut actually, from conservation of energy, the initial kinetic energy is converted into potential energy at the top, so at 10 meters, which is halfway, the potential energy would be mgh = mg * 10, and the kinetic energy would be the initial kinetic energy minus that.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating things.\n\nLet me stick to the original thought: only gravity is acting, so the net force is mg downward, with a magnitude of mg.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. mg.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
