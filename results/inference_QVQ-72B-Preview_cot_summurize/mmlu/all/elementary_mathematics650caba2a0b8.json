                    "text": "So Max and Jonathon were picking strawberries. Max picked 187 strawberries, and Jonathon picked 223 strawberries. Together, they ate 26 of the strawberries. We need to find out how many strawberries they have left. And there are some expressions given, and we need to see which one of those expressions correctly calculates the total number of strawberries left.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what the total number of strawberries they picked is. So, Max picked 187 and Jonathon picked 223. If I add those together, 187 plus 223, that should give me the total before they ate any.\n\nLet me calculate that: 187 + 223. Well, 187 plus 200 is 387, and then adding the remaining 23 makes it 410. So, they picked a total of 410 strawberries.\n\nNow, they ate 26 of those strawberries. So, to find out how many are left, I should subtract the number they ate from the total they picked.\n\nSo, 410 minus 26. Let's see, 400 minus 20 is 380, and then 10 minus 6 is 4, so altogether, they have 384 strawberries left.\n\nNow, looking at the options, I need to see which expression matches this calculation.\n\nOption A is 190 + 220 \u2013 30 + 4.\n\nWait, but Max picked 187, not 190, and Jonathon picked 223, not 220. So, this seems like an estimation or rounding, maybe to make the addition easier, but I'm not sure.\n\nIf I follow this expression: 190 + 220 is 410, then subtract 30 and add 4. So, 410 \u2013 30 is 380, and then 380 + 4 is 384. Hmm, that gives the same answer as my direct calculation.\n\nSo, maybe this is a way to approximate the total and then adjust for the difference.\n\nLet me see: 190 is 187 plus 3, and 220 is 223 minus 3. Wait, no, 223 minus 3 is 220, yes. So, they rounded up Max's strawberries by 3 and rounded down Jonathon's by 3, then subtracted 30 and added 4.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, maybe they rounded both amounts to the nearest ten and then adjusted for the difference.\n\nOption B is 185 + 225 \u2013 25 + 1.\n\nLet's see: 185 is 187 minus 2, and 225 is 223 plus 2. So, they rounded Max's down by 2 and Jonathon's up by 2. Then, subtract 25 and add 1.\n\nLet's calculate: 185 + 225 is 410, then 410 \u2013 25 is 385, and 385 + 1 is 386. But earlier, we got 384. So, this doesn't match.\n\nOption C is 200 + 200 \u2013 30 \u2013 4.\n\n200 + 200 is 400, then 400 \u2013 30 is 370, and 370 \u2013 4 is 366. That's way off from 384.\n\nOption D is 200 + 200 \u2013 25 \u2013 1.\n\n200 + 200 is 400, then 400 \u2013 25 is 375, and 375 \u2013 1 is 374. Still not matching 384.\n\nSo, only option A gives the correct result of 384.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nMax picked 187, Jonathon picked 223. 187 + 223:\n\n187\n\n+223\n\n------\n\n410\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, they ate 26, so 410 \u2013 26:\n\n410\n\n- 26\n\n------\n\n384\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, looking back at option A:\n\n190 + 220 \u2013 30 + 4.\n\n190 + 220 = 410\n\n410 \u2013 30 = 380\n\n380 + 4 = 384\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nOption B:\n\n185 + 225 = 410\n\n410 \u2013 25 = 385\n\n385 + 1 = 386\n\nNot 384.\n\nOption C:\n\n200 + 200 = 400\n\n400 \u2013 30 = 370\n\n370 \u2013 4 = 366\n\nNot 384.\n\nOption D:\n\n200 + 200 = 400\n\n400 \u2013 25 = 375\n\n375 \u2013 1 = 374\n\nNot 384.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression is option A.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me understand why option A works.\n\nThey rounded Max's strawberries up from 187 to 190, which is an increase of 3.\n\nRounded Jonathon's down from 223 to 220, which is a decrease of 3.\n\nSo, overall, the rounding cancels out for the total picked, giving 190 + 220 = 410, which matches the actual total.\n\nThen, they subtract 30 and add 4. Wait, but they only ate 26, so why subtract 30 and add 4?\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, no: the expression is 190 + 220 \u2013 30 + 4.\n\nBut the actual calculation should be 190 + 220 \u2013 26.\n\nWait, but in the problem, they ate 26, so to find the total left, it should be total picked minus 26.\n\nBut in option A, it's 190 + 220 \u2013 30 + 4.\n\nWait, that doesn't directly correspond to subtracting 26.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nMaybe they're using estimation and compensation.\n\nSo, 187 is 190 minus 3, and 223 is 220 plus 3.\n\nWait, no: 187 is 190 minus 3, and 223 is 220 plus 3.\n\nSo, if I add 190 + 220, that's 410, which is the same as 187 + 223.\n\nThen, they subtract 30 and add 4.\n\nWait, but the actual calculation should be 410 \u2013 26.\n\nWait, perhaps the 30 and 4 are adjustments for the estimation.\n\nWait, 26 is 30 minus 4.\n\nSo, maybe they're subtracting 30 and then adding back the 4 they over-subtracted.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, 410 \u2013 30 = 380, then +4 = 384, which matches the actual total left.\n\nSo, option A is correctly representing the calculation.\n\nWhereas the other options don't give the correct total.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
