                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about Butler's view on injustice. The options are:\n\nA. Desires for external goods.\n\nB. Love of injustice.\n\nC. Ill-will toward others.\n\nD. Self-hatred.\n\nI need to find out which one Butler believes causes injustice.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand who Butler is. I think Joseph Butler was an English bishop and philosopher, known for his works on morality and human nature. He wrote a book called \"Sermons on Several Important Subjects,\" which might be relevant here.\n\nBut since I don't remember the specifics of his views on injustice, I'll have to think this through step by step.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Desires for external goods.\n\nThis seems plausible. A lot of philosophical thought suggests that excessive desires or greed can lead to unjust actions. For example, if someone desires wealth or status too much, they might be tempted to cheat or harm others to get what they want. But I'm not sure if this is specifically Butler's view.\n\nB. Love of injustice.\n\nThis sounds a bit straightforward. It suggests that some people just enjoy being unfair or harming others. While this might be true for some individuals, I doubt it's a comprehensive explanation for all instances of injustice. Plus, I don't recall Butler emphasizing a inherent love of injustice.\n\nC. Ill-will toward others.\n\nThis seems related to feelings of anger or resentment towards others, which could certainly motivate unjust actions. If someone harbors ill-will towards a particular group or individual, they might act in ways that are unfair or discriminatory. This seems like a possible cause of injustice.\n\nD. Self-hatred.\n\nThis is interesting. Self-hatred could potentially lead someone to act in ways that are self-destructive, which might indirectly cause injustice to others. For example, if someone hates themselves and feels worthless, they might not care about the consequences of their actions on others. However, this seems a bit indirect, and I'm not sure if Butler connects self-hatred directly to injustice.\n\nI need to think more deeply about Butler's philosophy. I recall that he was known for his moral sense theory, which posits that humans have an innate moral sense that guides our judgments about right and wrong. According to this theory, our moral faculties naturally incline us towards virtue and against vice.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps injustice arises when this moral sense is overpowered or ignored due to other factors, like personal desires or emotions.\n\nGoing back to the options, perhaps desires for external goods (A) could be seen as overpowering one's moral sense, leading to unjust actions.\n\nSimilarly, ill-will toward others (C) could cloud one's moral judgment, causing one to act unjustly towards those they dislike.\n\nLove of injustice (B) seems more like a fundamental corruption of the moral sense, which might be too extreme for Butler's view, as he believed in an innate moral sense inclined towards virtue.\n\nSelf-hatred (D) might affect one's self-perception but isn't directly linked to causing injustice towards others in Butler's framework.\n\nGiven this, I'm leaning towards A or C. Desires for external goods can lead to selfish behavior that disregards the rights and well-being of others, which aligns with many philosophical interpretations of injustice.\n\nIll-will toward others (C) also directly contradicts the moral sense's inclination towards virtue, as it involves negative feelings and potentially harmful intentions towards others.\n\nHowever, I think desires for external goods (A) might be a more comprehensive answer, as they can lead not only to direct harm but also to systemic injustices, like economic inequalities or environmental degradation, which affect many people indirectly.\n\nIll-will, on the other hand, is more personal and relates to direct harm towards specific individuals or groups.\n\nTherefore, I'm going to go with A. Desires for external goods as the cause of injustice in Butler's view.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
