The term for this practice is supposed to be one of these options: front-loading, prior restraint, reapportionment, or gerrymandering. Hmm, let me think about this.\n\nFirst off, I know that congressional districts are areas that each have their own representative in the House of Representatives. These districts are redrawn every ten years after the census to account for population changes. But sometimes, the way these lines are drawn can be manipulated to advantage one political party. That sounds like gerrymandering, right?\n\nLet me double-check. Gerrymandering is when district boundaries are manipulated to favor one party or group. It's named after Elbridge Gerry, a governor of Massachusetts who signed a bill in 1812 that created a district shaped like a salamander, which was called a \"gerry-mander.\" So, yeah, that seems to fit the description.\n\nNow, what about the other options? Front-loading usually refers to scheduling early events or primaries in elections to gain an advantage, but that's not about drawing district lines. Prior restraint is a legal concept related to censorship before publication, which doesn't seem relevant here. Reapportionment is the process of redrawing district lines based on population changes, but that's more about adjusting representation fairly, not necessarily benefiting one party.\n\nSo, based on this, gerrymandering seems to be the correct term for drawing district lines to give one party an advantage. Let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there any way that front-loading could relate to drawing district lines? Not really. Prior restraint is completely different. Reapportionment is about fair representation, not partisan advantage.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. gerrymandering.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
