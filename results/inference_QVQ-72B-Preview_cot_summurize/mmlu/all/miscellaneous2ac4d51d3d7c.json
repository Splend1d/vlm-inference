Lamikins, C. Suga'baby, D. Swee'pea.\"\n\nHmm, I'm a big fan of Popeye cartoons, but I can't remember the name of the baby that appears in them. Let me think carefully.\n\nI know that Popeye is a sailor man who eats spinach to get strong. He has a girlfriend named Olive Oyl, and there's also Bluto, who is sometimes called Brutus, who is Popeye's rival. But I'm trying to recall the name of the baby in these cartoons.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nFirst, Pun'kin. I don't think I've heard that name in the Popeye cartoons. Maybe it's from something else, but not sure.\n\nNext, Lamikins. That sounds a bit like \"limpkins,\" which I think is a type of bird, but I don't recall any baby by that name in the Popeye series.\n\nThen, Suga'baby. That sounds sweet, but again, I don't remember that name from the cartoons.\n\nLastly, Swee'pea. Now, Swee'pea rings a bell. I think I've heard that name before in relation to Popeye. But let me make sure.\n\nI think Swee'pea is the name of the baby who sometimes appears in the cartoons. I remember seeing a baby character in some of the Popeye episodes, and I think it was called Swee'pea.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll try to recall if any of the other names are also associated with Popeye.\n\nPun'kin\u2014no, that doesn't seem familiar.\n\nLamikins\u2014I'm drawing a blank here.\n\nSuga'baby\u2014doesn't ring any bells in the context of Popeye cartoons.\n\nSwee'pea, on the other hand, seems very familiar. I think he's even appeared in some of the comic strips as well.\n\nLet me see if I can recall any specific scenes or episodes where this baby appears. I think in some cartoons, Swee'pea is taken care of by Popeye or Olive Oyl, and there are adventures revolve around them.\n\nI don't recall any other baby characters in the Popeye series, so I think Swee'pea is the correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider if there are any other babies that might have appeared occasionally in the cartoons. But I can't think of any other regular baby characters.\n\nTherefore, I'm fairly confident that the correct answer is D. Swee'pea.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
