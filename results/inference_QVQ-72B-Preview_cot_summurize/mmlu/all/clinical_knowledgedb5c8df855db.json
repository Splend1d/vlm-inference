                    "text": "So I've got this question here, and I need to figure out which one of these statements isn't true. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: \"Muscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate.\" Okay, so I know that glycogen is a storage form of glucose in muscles and the liver. In muscles, when you need energy, glycogen is broken down into glucose-1-phosphate through a process called glycogenolysis. This is an enzymatic process, and glucose-1-phosphate is a key intermediate that can be used in glycolysis to produce ATP. So, this seems correct.\n\nMoving on to option B: \"Elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles.\" I recall that muscle fibers are classified into Type I and Type II. Type I fibers are slow-twitch fibers that are better at endurance activities because they're more efficient at using oxygen to produce ATP. Type II fibers are fast-twitch fibers, better for short bursts of high-intensity activity. Elite endurance runners are known for their ability to sustain long periods of activity, so having more Type I fibers would make sense. Studies have shown that top endurance athletes often have a higher percentage of Type I fibers. So, this also seems correct.\n\nOption C: \"Liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration.\" Yes, the liver plays a crucial role in regulating blood glucose levels. It stores glycogen and can break it down into glucose when blood sugar levels drop, releasing glucose into the bloodstream. This process is called glycogenolysis, similar to what happens in muscles, but in the liver, it's primarily to maintain blood glucose levels. So, this statement is true.\n\nFinally, option D: \"Insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body.\" Hmm, I know that insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps regulate blood sugar levels. It promotes the uptake of glucose into cells, particularly in muscle and fat tissues. But does it promote glucose uptake by all tissues in the body? I think there are some tissues that are insulin-independent for glucose uptake.\n\nFor example, the brain doesn't rely on insulin for glucose uptake; it has its own transporters that can take up glucose regardless of insulin levels. Similarly, some parts of the eye and the kidney also have insulin-independent glucose transport. So, while insulin is important for many tissues, especially muscle and adipose tissue, not all tissues require insulin for glucose uptake.\n\nBased on that, option D seems to be overstating things. It's not accurate to say that insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body, because some tissues can take up glucose independently of insulin.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that option D is not a true statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
