                    "text": "So I've got this landlord-tenant situation with multiple assignments, and I need to figure out how much the college freshman is liable for in unpaid rent. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the landlord leased the apartment to a college senior for three years starting on December 1, 2007, with a monthly rent of $1,000 due on the first of each month.\n\nThe senior lived there for six months, so from December 1, 2007, to May 31, 2008. Then, on June 1, 2008, the senior assigned his interest to a college junior.\n\nThe junior paid rent for two months, which would be June and July 2008, I assume. Then, on August 1, 2008, the junior assigned his interest to a college sophomore.\n\nThe sophomore took possession on August 1, 2008, and paid rent for August but didn't pay for the next three months, which would be September, October, and November 2008.\n\nThen, on December 1, 2008, the sophomore assigned the premises to a college freshman, who took possession but didn't pay any rent from December 1, 2008, to April 1, 2009.\n\nNow, the landlord is suing the freshman on April 5, 2009, for outstanding rent.\n\nI need to determine how much the freshman is liable for.\n\nFirst, I should understand the concept of assignment in a lease. When a tenant assigns their lease to another person, that person takes over the tenant's rights and responsibilities under the lease. So, each assignee becomes responsible for paying the rent and maintaining the property as per the original lease agreement.\n\nIn this case, the original lease was for three years, starting in December 2007, so it was supposed to end in November 2010, I believe.\n\nBut let's focus on the period from December 1, 2008, to April 1, 2009, when the freshman was occupying the apartment.\n\nThe freshman occupied the apartment for five months: December 2008, January 2009, February 2009, March 2009, and April 2009.\n\nSince the rent is $1,000 per month, and it's due on the first of each month, the freshman should have paid $1,000 for each of these months.\n\nHowever, the freshman didn't pay any rent during this period.\n\nSo, naively, it seems like the freshman owes $5,000 (5 months * $1,000/month).\n\nBut the question is asking for the amount the freshman is most likely liable for, and the options range from $4,000 to $8,000.\n\nWait, maybe there's more to it.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the entire period from the original lease start date to the time the lawsuit was filed, but the question specifies that the landlord is suing the freshman for outstanding rent \"that is due on the premises.\"\n\nSo, likely, it's focusing on the period when the freshman was occupying the apartment, which is from December 1, 2008, to April 1, 2009.\n\nBut let's think about it differently.\n\nMaybe the landlord is seeking rent not only from the freshman but also from previous assignees.\n\nHowever, the question specifies that the landlord is bringing an action against the freshman to recover the outstanding rent, so it's likely that the claim is specifically against the freshman for the period he occupied the apartment.\n\nBut wait, in some jurisdictions, assignees might be liable for the entire remaining lease term, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the landlord is trying to collect from the freshman for more than just those five months.\n\nLet me consider the total unpaid rent up to that point.\n\nFrom the senior to the junior to the sophomore to the freshman, there might be unpaid rent accumulating.\n\nThe senior paid for six months: December 2007 to May 2008.\n\nThe junior paid for two months: June and July 2008.\n\nThe sophomore paid for one month: August 2008, but didn't pay for September, October, and November 2008.\n\nThen, the freshman didn't pay for December 2008 to April 2009.\n\nSo, total unpaid rent would be:\n\nSophomore didn't pay for September, October, November 2008: 3 months\n\nFreshman didn't pay for December 2008 to April 2009: 5 months\n\nTotal unpaid rent: 8 months\n\nAt $1,000 per month: $8,000\n\nBut is the freshman liable for the sophomore's unpaid rent?\n\nProbably not, unless there's some agreement that the freshman is taking over all past due obligations.\n\nGenerally, each assignee is responsible for the rent during their occupancy period, not for the past rent owed by previous assignees.\n\nSo, the freshman would be liable for the five months he occupied the apartment: December 2008 to April 2009, which is $5,000.\n\nBut option C is $5,000, which seems straightforward.\n\nHowever, maybe there's more to it.\n\nPerhaps the landlord is claiming additional amounts, like late fees or damages, but the problem doesn't mention any of that.\n\nIt only mentions that the landlord is suing the freshman to recover the outstanding rent that is due on the premises.\n\nSo, assuming that \"outstanding rent\" refers to the rent that the freshman owes for his occupancy, it should be $5,000.\n\nBut let's see if there's any reason to think it could be higher.\n\nIf the freshman is also responsible for the sophomore's unpaid rent, then it would be $8,000, which is option A.\n\nBut that seems unlikely unless there's a clause in the assignment agreement making the freshman responsible for all past due rent.\n\nWithout such information, I don't think that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the landlord is trying to collect from all assignees, but the question specifies that the lawsuit is against the freshman only.\n\nSo, the freshman is only liable for the rent during his occupancy, which is five months at $1,000 per month, totaling $5,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. $5,000.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
