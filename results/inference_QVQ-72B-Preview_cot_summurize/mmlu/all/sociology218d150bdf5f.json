                    "text": "So I'm trying to answer this question about the causes of anorexia in Western cultures, according to sociologists like Bordo in 1993. The options are:\n\nA. A generally ascetic, frugal lifestyle that can be taken to extremes.\n\nB. Traditional images of women as emotional, domesticated, and unassertive.\n\nC. The social construction of mental illness, through which 'normal' patterns of behavior are pathologized.\n\nD. The new ideal of independent, self-assured femininity, combined with cultural values of achievement and control.\n\nI need to recall what Bordo argued in her work from 1993. I think it was \"Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body.\" If I remember correctly, she discussed how cultural ideals of femininity and body image contribute to eating disorders like anorexia.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A suggests that anorexia is a result of a generally ascetic and frugal lifestyle taken to extremes. While asceticism involves self-discipline and abstention from indulgence, I don't recall asceticism being a widespread characteristic of Western culture, especially not in a way that directly leads to anorexia. Maybe in some subcultures, but generally, Western cultures are often associated with consumerism and abundance, not frugality and asceticism. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nOption B mentions traditional images of women as emotional, domesticated, and unassertive. While these stereotypes do exist and have influenced women's roles in society, I don't think they directly cause anorexia. These traits might affect self-perception and social roles, but they don't specifically relate to body image and eating behaviors in the way that anorexia does. So, perhaps this isn't the main attribution.\n\nOption C talks about the social construction of mental illness, where normal behaviors are pathologized. This is an interesting point and aligns with some critical perspectives on mental health. However, while it's true that definitions of mental illness can be socially constructed and influenced by cultural norms, I don't think this directly explains the 'epidemic' of anorexia. It might relate more to how anorexia is diagnosed or understood, rather than its causes.\n\nOption D refers to the new ideal of independent, self-assured femininity combined with cultural values of achievement and control. This seems particularly relevant to contemporary Western societies that value individualism, self-reliance, and success. The pressure to achieve and maintain control over one's life, including one's body, could lead to extreme measures like anorexia. Moreover, the ideal of self-assured femininity might be linked to specific body images, such as being thin, which is often equated with discipline and success.\n\nConsidering Bordo's work, I recall that she discussed how Western culture places a premium on thinness, especially for women, and how this ideal is internalized and pursued through various means, including restrictive eating practices that can lead to anorexia.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most accurate attribution based on Bordo's arguments. It aligns with the cultural emphasis on achievement, control, and a particular ideal of femininity that values independence and self-assurance, often tied to a slender physique.\n\nTo make sure I'm not missing something, I should think about whether Bordo might have emphasized multiple factors. However, based on my recollection, her analysis focused on the cultural construction of body image ideals and their impact on women's lives, particularly in the context of achieving and maintaining a certain body type seen as desirable and successful.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is D: the new ideal of independent, self-assured femininity, combined with cultural values of achievement and control.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
