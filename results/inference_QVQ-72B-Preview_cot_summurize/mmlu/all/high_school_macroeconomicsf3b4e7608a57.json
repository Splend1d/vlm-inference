                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about Keynesian theory. There are four options, and I need to pick the one that aligns with Keynesian economics. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says, \"the FED should not conduct monetary policy.\" Hmm, the FED is the Federal Reserve, which is in charge of monetary policy in the United States. Keynesian theory does emphasize the role of government intervention during economic downturns, but I think they do see a role for monetary policy, especially in managing interest rates and money supply. So, I'm not sure if Keynesians would say the FED should not conduct monetary policy at all. Maybe they believe in a more active role for monetary policy.\n\nOption B says, \"changes in the money supply have significant effects.\" Well, Keynesians are known for their focus on aggregate demand and how changes in government spending and taxation can influence the economy. While they do recognize that money supply can affect the economy, especially in the long run, their primary focus is on fiscal policy in the short run. So, maybe this isn't the core of Keynesian theory.\n\nOption C says, \"fiscal policy is the preferred way of shifting the aggregate demand curve.\" Now, this sounds familiar. Keynesians are famous for advocating fiscal policy\u2014changes in government spending and taxation\u2014to manage the economy. They believe that during recessions, increasing government spending or cutting taxes can boost aggregate demand and pull the economy out of a slump. So, this seems like a key aspect of Keynesian economics.\n\nOption D says, \"the FED should allow the money supply to grow at a constant rate.\" This sounds more like something associated with monetarism, especially Milton Friedman's ideas, rather than Keynesian theory. Monetarists believe that steady growth in the money supply is the best way to achieve economic stability.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, Option C seems to be the most accurate representation of Keynesian theory. They do prefer fiscal policy as a tool to manage aggregate demand.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. Keynesians believe that during economic downturns, insufficient aggregate demand leads to unemployment and decreased production. To correct this, they advocate for increased government spending or reduced taxes to stimulate demand. This directly shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right, leading to higher output and employment.\n\nOn the other hand, monetary policy, while recognized as having some effect, is seen as less direct and potentially less effective in the short run, especially if interest rates are already low.\n\nSo, yeah, I think Option C is the correct choice. Fiscal policy is indeed the preferred way of shifting the aggregate demand curve according to Keynesian theory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
