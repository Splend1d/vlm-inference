                    "text": "So I've got this question here about cyber-security, and it's asking which of these concepts doesn't form part of the technical discourse on cyber-security. The options are A: business networks, B: computer experts, C: anti-virus industry, and D: computer networks. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what \"technical discourse on cyber-security\" means. Discourse generally refers to the way a particular subject is discussed or talked about, often within a specific community or field. So, technical discourse on cyber-security would involve the discussions, ideas, and terminology used by professionals in the field of cyber-security, focusing on technical aspects.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate each option to see which one doesn't belong in this context.\n\nOption A: business networks. Well, business networks can be an important part of cyber-security because businesses often have networks that need to be secured from cyber threats. So, discussing business networks would likely be part of cyber-security discourse, especially since protecting business networks is a major concern in cyber-security.\n\nOption B: computer experts. These are the people who work in the field of computer science and technology, often including cyber-security professionals. So, computer experts are crucial to the technical discourse on cyber-security. They develop theories, create security systems, and find solutions to cyber threats. Without them, the discourse wouldn't exist.\n\nOption C: anti-virus industry. This seems directly related to cyber-security. The anti-virus industry is all about creating software to detect, prevent, and remove malware and viruses from computer systems. This is a core aspect of cyber-security, so it should definitely be part of the technical discourse.\n\nOption D: computer networks. This seems pretty straightforward. Cyber-security is largely about securing computer networks from unauthorized access, theft, or damage. So, computer networks are fundamental to the field of cyber-security.\n\nWait a minute, all of these options seem closely related to cyber-security. Maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps there's one that is more peripheral or doesn't directly relate to the technical aspects of cyber-security.\n\nLet me consider \"business networks\" again. While businesses use computer networks and require cyber-security measures, the term \"business networks\" might also encompass other types of networks beyond just technical ones, such as social networks or supply chain networks. However, in the context of cyber-security, it's still relevant.\n\nComputer experts are definitely central to cyber-security, as they're the ones developing the technologies and strategies to protect systems.\n\nThe anti-virus industry is directly involved in creating tools to combat cyber threats, which is a key part of cyber-security.\n\nComputer networks are the very foundation of cyber-security concerns.\n\nSo, if I had to choose one that doesn't fit, maybe it's \"business networks\" because, while they are relevant, the term could also refer to non-technical networks in a business context. But even then, in cyber-security discourse, business networks often refer to the technological infrastructure of a business.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to test whether I recognize that business networks are more about the application of cyber-security rather than being part of the technical discourse itself. But that doesn't seem right, because businesses drive a lot of the development in cyber-security technologies.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at it from the perspective of who is doing the discoursing. Technical discourse on cyber-security is probably led by technologists, researchers, and practitioners in the field. So, computer experts would be central to this discourse.\n\nAnti-virus industry is composed of companies and professionals who develop security solutions, so they're definitely part of the discourse.\n\nComputer networks are the subject matter.\n\nBusiness networks might be seen as the end-users or the entities that need protection, but they might not be the ones driving the technical discourse.\n\nBut that seems like a stretch. In reality, businesses often influence the direction of cyber-security research and development because they have specific needs and requirements.\n\nMaybe the key is to identify which option isn't directly involved in the technical aspects of cyber-security.\n\nOption A: business networks \u2013 while they use cyber-security technologies, the primary focus is on how these technologies are implemented and managed within a business context, which might be more about management and operations rather than the technical discourse itself.\n\nOption B: computer experts \u2013 they are the ones creating the technology and theories, so they are central to the technical discourse.\n\nOption C: anti-virus industry \u2013 this is part of the technical solutions developed for cyber-security.\n\nOption D: computer networks \u2013 these are the systems being protected, so they are fundamental to the technical discourse.\n\nSo, perhaps business networks are more about the application and management side rather than the technical development and discussion of cyber-security technologies.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be A: business networks.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Maybe I should consider an example.\n\nSuppose there's a conference on cyber-security where computer scientists, security researchers, and software developers are discussing the latest threats and defense mechanisms. In this technical discourse, they would be talking about computer networks, anti-virus software, and various technical solutions. Business networks might be mentioned in the context of how to implement these solutions in a business setting, but the primary discussion is technical.\n\nSo, while business networks are important to cyber-security, the focus of the technical discourse is more on the tools, techniques, and theories related to securing computer networks.\n\nTherefore, A: business networks is the concept that does not form part of the technical discourse on cyber-security.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
