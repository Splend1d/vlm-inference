                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Leo Tolstoy says that art is _____.\" And the options are A. expression, B. form, C. representation, D. abstract. Hmm, I need to figure out what Tolstoy thought about art. I remember that Tolstoy was a Russian writer, famous for books like \"War and Peace\" and \"Anna Karenina,\" but I don't recall his specific definition of art.\n\nLet me think about this. Maybe I can recall some of his ideas on art. I think he had some theories about art's purpose and its connection to emotion and morality. I seem to remember that he believed art should evoke feelings and that it should be understandable to the common person.\n\nWait, is there a famous essay or something where he discusses art? I think he wrote a treatise called \"What Is Art?\" Yeah, that sounds familiar. Maybe I should look that up to find his definition.\n\nAlright, assuming I can't look it up right now, let's see if I can recall his view. In \"What Is Art?\", Tolstoy argues that art is a means of communication between people, expressing the artist's emotions and evoking emotions in others. He also\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u827a\u672f\u5e94\u8be5\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u4eba\u5f00\u653e\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u53d7\u8fc7\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u7cbe\u82f1\u3002\n\nSo, based on that, which of these options\u2014expression, form, representation, or abstract\u2014best fits his definition?\n\nLet's consider \"expression.\" That sounds like it aligns with his idea that art communicates emotions. Expression can be seen as the act of conveying feelings or ideas through art.\n\n\"Form\" seems more related to the structure or shape of art, which might be important, but I don't think it's central to Tolstoy's definition.\n\n\"Representation\" makes me think of art that depicts something realistically, like a painting of a landscape or a sculpture of a figure. Tolstoy did value art that was understandable and accessible to ordinary people, so perhaps representation is important to him.\n\n\"Abstract\" is the opposite of representational art. It's more about forms, colors, and textures without depicting real-world objects. Given that Tolstoy emphasized clarity and understanding, abstract art might not fit his ideal.\n\nBut wait, maybe he had a broader view. After all, abstract art can still convey emotions and ideas, even if it doesn't represent specific objects.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit torn between \"expression\" and \"representation.\" On one hand, expression seems to capture the emotional communication aspect, which Tolstoy valued highly. On the other hand, representation aligns with his idea that art should be clear and understandable to everyone.\n\nLet me think differently. If I had to choose one word that sums up Tolstoy's view of art, what would it be? Expression seems to capture the essence of communicating emotions, which he considered crucial. Representation, while important for clarity, might not capture the full scope of his definition.\n\nMaybe I should consider that art is an expression that can take various forms, including representational or abstract, as long as it communicates emotions effectively.\n\nGiven that, perhaps \"expression\" is the best answer here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he defined art as something else entirely, and I'm misremembering.\n\nWait, I think he had a more detailed definition. In \"What Is Art?\", he defines art as \"a human activity consisting in this, that one man consciously, by means of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings he has lived through, and that others are infected by these feelings and also experience them.\"\n\nSo, according to this, art is essentially the communication of emotions through external signs.\n\nGiven that, \"expression\" seems to align closely with this definition, as it involves conveying emotions or ideas.\n\n\"Form\" might refer more to the structure or style of the art, which, while important, isn't the core of his definition.\n\n\"Representation\" suggests depicting something realistically, which Tolstoy appreciated for its clarity, but his definition isn't limited to representational art.\n\n\"Abstract\" refers to art that doesn't depict real-world objects, which could still communicate emotions, but it's not the focus of his definition.\n\nTherefore, \"expression\" seems to be the most accurate choice based on Tolstoy's definition of art.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other context that might make another option more suitable.\n\nI recall that Tolstoy criticized art that was elitist or incomprehensible to the general public. He believed that true art should be understandable and evoke similar emotions in everyone who experiences it.\n\nGiven that, perhaps \"representation\" could be seen as important because representational art is often more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nHowever, Tolstoy also recognized that abstract emotions could be expressed through music, which doesn't necessarily represent anything concrete.\n\nSo, maybe he was open to both representational and abstract forms of art, as long as they effectively communicated emotions.\n\nIn that case, \"expression\" still seems like the best fit.\n\nMoreover, in his essay, he discusses how art transmits feelings from one person to another, which is essentially the expression and communication of emotions.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A. expression.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ expression}} \\]"
