And the options are A. fiqh, B. dhikr, C. ijtihad, D. tafsir.\" Hmm, I need to figure this out. I'm not an expert on Islamic terms, but I've heard some of these before.\n\nFirst, the question is about commentary on the Qur'an that means \"unveiling.\" So, let's break it down. The Qur'an is the holy book of Islam, and commentary on it would involve explaining or interpreting its verses. \"Unveiling\" suggests revealing the meaning or deeper understanding of the text.\n\nLet me look at each option:\n\nA. fiqh \u2013 I think fiqh is the Islamic jurisprudence, like the legal aspect of Islam. It's about interpreting Islamic law based on the Qur'an and Hadith. But that doesn't sound exactly like commentary on the Qur'an in the sense of unveiling its meaning. Maybe not the right choice.\n\nB. dhikr \u2013 This rings a bell as a practice of remembrance in Islam, like repeating the name of Allah or certain phrases. It's more of a devotional act rather than a commentary on the Qur'an. So, probably not that one.\n\nC. ijtihad \u2013 I've heard this term before. I think it refers to independent reasoning or interpretation in Islamic law. Similar to fiqh, it seems more related to legal interpretations rather than general commentary on the Qur'an's meaning. Maybe not the best fit.\n\nD. tafsir \u2013 Now, this one sounds familiar in the context of explaining the Qur'an. I think tafsir is the term used for exegesis or commentary on the Qur'an. The word tafsir actually means \"interpretation\" or \"explanation\" in Arabic, which aligns with the idea of unveiling the meaning of the Qur'an's verses.\n\nLet me double-check. If tafsir is about interpreting and explaining the Qur'an, then it would make sense that it \"unveils\" or reveals the meaning of the text. That seems to fit the description perfectly.\n\nSo, based on that, I would say that D. tafsir is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me see if there's any other way one of the other terms could fit. Fiqh is more about the legal aspects, dhikr is about remembrance and worship, and ijtihad is about independent reasoning in Islamic law. None of these directly relate to commentary on the Qur'an's meaning in the way that tafsir does.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that tafsir is the term for commentary on the Qur'an that means \"unveiling.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. tafsir}} \\]"
