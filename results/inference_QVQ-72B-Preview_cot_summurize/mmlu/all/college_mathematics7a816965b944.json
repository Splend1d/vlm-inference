                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that f(x) is a function whose graph passes through the origin, which means that f(0) = 0. That's helpful. And there's this recursive formula: f(2n) = n\u00b2 + f[2(n - 1)] for every integer n. I need to find f(8).\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what this recursive formula is telling me. It relates the value of the function at 2n to the value at 2(n-1), plus some term involving n squared.\n\nSince I need to find f(8), which is f(2*4), I can think of n as 4 in this context. So, plugging n = 4 into the recursive formula:\n\nf(8) = 4\u00b2 + f[2(4 - 1)] = 16 + f(6).\n\nHmm, so now I have f(8) in terms of f(6). I need to find f(6) to proceed. So, let's find f(6) using the same recursive formula.\n\nFor f(6), which is f(2*3), set n = 3:\n\nf(6) = 3\u00b2 + f[2(3 - 1)] = 9 + f(4).\n\nNow, f(6) is expressed in terms of f(4). Let's find f(4):\n\nf(4) = 2\u00b2 + f[2(2 - 1)] = 4 + f(2).\n\nAnd now, f(4) is in terms of f(2). So, next, find f(2):\n\nf(2) = 1\u00b2 + f[2(1 - 1)] = 1 + f(0).\n\nAh, but we know that f(0) = 0, since the graph passes through the origin. So, plugging that in:\n\nf(2) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nNow, I have f(2) = 1.\n\nNext, plug back to find f(4):\n\nf(4) = 4 + f(2) = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nThen, f(6) = 9 + f(4) = 9 + 5 = 14.\n\nAnd finally, f(8) = 16 + f(6) = 16 + 14 = 30.\n\nSo, the value of f(8) is 30.\n\nWait a minute, is there a pattern here that I can generalize? It seems like each step is building upon the previous one, adding a square of the integer and the previous function value.\n\nLet me see if I can express f(2n) in a closed-form formula.\n\nStarting from n = 1:\n\nf(2) = 1 + f(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nn = 2:\n\nf(4) = 4 + f(2) = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nn = 3:\n\nf(6) = 9 + f(4) = 9 + 5 = 14.\n\nn = 4:\n\nf(8) = 16 + f(6) = 16 + 14 = 30.\n\nLooking at these values:\n\nf(2) = 1\n\nf(4) = 5\n\nf(6) = 14\n\nf(8) = 30\n\nIs there a pattern? Let's see the differences:\n\nf(4) - f(2) = 4\n\nf(6) - f(4) = 9\n\nf(8) - f(6) = 16\n\nHmm, the differences are perfect squares: 4 = 2\u00b2, 9 = 3\u00b2, 16 = 4\u00b2.\n\nWait, but according to the recursive formula, f(2n) - f(2(n-1)) = n\u00b2.\n\nSo, it's adding n\u00b2 each time, where n increases by 1 each step.\n\nSo, to find a general formula, perhaps I can sum up these n\u00b2 terms.\n\nLet me try to express f(2n) in terms of n.\n\nStarting from f(0) = 0.\n\nThen, f(2) = 1 + f(0) = 1\n\nf(4) = 4 + f(2) = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nf(6) = 9 + f(4) = 9 + 5 = 14\n\nf(8) = 16 + f(6) = 16 + 14 = 30\n\nLooking at these, it seems like f(2n) = sum of squares from n=1 to n.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor n=1: sum of squares up to 1: 1\u00b2 = 1\n\nn=2: sum up to 2: 1 + 4 = 5\n\nn=3: sum up to 3: 1 + 4 + 9 = 14\n\nn=4: sum up to 4: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30\n\nYes, that matches the values I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, the general formula for f(2n) is the sum of squares from 1 to n.\n\nThere's a formula for the sum of the first n squares: sum_{k=1 to n} k\u00b2 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.\n\nSo, f(2n) = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.\n\nThat's a nice closed-form expression.\n\nLet me verify this with n=4: f(8) = 4*5*9/6 = 180/6 = 30, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, using this formula, I can find f(8) directly as 30.\n\nAlternatively, since the options are given, and 30 is one of them, I can conclude that the answer is 30.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nGiven that the function passes through the origin and the recursive relation, perhaps I can find a general expression for f(x) for any x, but since the recursion is only defined for even integers, and specifically for x=2n, it's probably best to stick with the approach I've taken.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider generating a general formula for f(2n) by summing the recursive relation.\n\nStarting from the recursive formula: f(2n) = n\u00b2 + f(2(n-1))\n\nI can write this for n, n-1, n-2, and so on:\n\nf(2n) = n\u00b2 + f(2(n-1))\n\nf(2(n-1)) = (n-1)\u00b2 + f(2(n-2))\n\n...\n\nf(4) = 2\u00b2 + f(2)\n\nf(2) = 1\u00b2 + f(0)\n\nNow, if I substitute each equation into the one above it, I can express f(2n) in terms of f(0):\n\nf(2n) = n\u00b2 + [(n-1)\u00b2 + f(2(n-2))]\n\n= n\u00b2 + (n-1)\u00b2 + [f(2(n-2))]\n\n= n\u00b2 + (n-1)\u00b2 + [(n-2)\u00b2 + f(2(n-3))]\n\n...\n\nContinuing this way, eventually, I'll reach f(2):\n\nf(2n) = n\u00b2 + (n-1)\u00b2 + ... + 2\u00b2 + f(2)\n\nBut f(2) = 1\u00b2 + f(0) = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nSo, f(2n) = sum from k=1 to n of k\u00b2 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6\n\nAgain, leading me to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, f(8) = 4*5*9/6 = 30.\n\nSo, the answer is 30.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 24\n\nB. 30\n\nC. 32\n\nD. 36\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. 30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
