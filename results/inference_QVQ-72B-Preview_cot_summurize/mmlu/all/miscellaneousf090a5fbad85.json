Ten miles long and nearly 500 feet deep (152.4 m meters), Lake McDonald, the largest lake in the park, is a direct result of glacial carving. High peaks surrounding the lake all show evidence of the power of glaciers to carve even the hardest of rock. The powerful glaciers that carved the broad U-shaped valley that Lake McDonald sits in also carved smaller hanging valleys with wonderful waterfalls that are accessible by numerous hiking trails. Which of the following best identifies the intended audience of the passage?\n\nA. Scientists researching glacier development\nB. Teachers interested in creating virtual park field trips\nC. Academics studying the historical context of national parks\nD. Families interested in visiting Lake McDonald\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this passage from the National Park Service's website about Lake McDonald. It's describing the lake, talking about how it's ten miles long and almost 500 feet deep, and how it was formed by glaciers carving out the land. There are high peaks around the lake that show signs of glacial carving, and smaller valleys with waterfalls that you can reach by hiking trails. The question is asking which audience this passage is intended for, and the options are scientists researching glacier development, teachers interested in creating virtual park field trips, academics studying the historical context of national parks, or families interested in visiting Lake McDonald.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the passage is trying to achieve. It's on the National Park Service's website, which is likely aimed at educating the general public about the park's features and perhaps encouraging visitation. The language used seems informative but not overly technical, which suggests it's not primarily intended for specialists like scientists or academics.\n\nLet me look at option A: scientists researching glacier development. If this were the intended audience, I'd expect the passage to be more detailed, maybe including specific data about glacier sizes, dates of glacial activity, or scientific terminology related to glacial formation. But the passage is more descriptive and less technical, so it probably isn't aimed at scientists.\n\nOption B: teachers interested in creating virtual park field trips. This could be a possibility because the passage provides a good overview of the lake and its surroundings, which could be useful for educators looking to teach about the park. However, it doesn't specifically provide materials or suggestions for creating a virtual field trip; it's more of a general description.\n\nOption C: academics studying the historical context of national parks. Again, if the intended audience were academics, I'd expect more in-depth information, perhaps discussing the history of the park, its formation, or its significance in a broader context. The passage does mention glacial carving, which is part of the park's geological history, but it's not deep enough for academic research.\n\nOption D: families interested in visiting Lake McDonald. This seems plausible. The passage is written in an engaging way that highlights the beauty and features of the lake, such as its size and depth, the surrounding peaks, and the accessible waterfalls via hiking trails. This kind of information might appeal to families planning a trip, as it gives them a sense of what to expect and what activities are available.\n\nThinking back, the National Park Service's website is likely designed to inform and attract visitors, providing them with the necessary information to plan their trips and understand the significance of the places they're visiting. The passage about Lake McDonald fits into that purpose by describing the lake's features and the natural phenomena that shaped it, while also mentioning recreational opportunities like hiking trails to waterfalls.\n\nSo, among the given options, D. Families interested in visiting Lake McDonald seems to be the most appropriate intended audience for this passage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
