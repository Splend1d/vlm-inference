That means H points to U, P points to U, and W points to P. I need to express the joint probability P(H, U, P, W) in terms of the conditional probabilities based on this network.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a Bayesian network is. It's a directed acyclic graph that represents the probabilistic relationships among a set of variables. The joint probability distribution over all the variables can be factored into a product of conditional probabilities according to the graph's structure.\n\nThe general formula for a Bayesian network is:\n\nP(X1, X2, ..., Xn) = \u03a0 P(Xi | Parents(Xi))\n\nWhere Parents(Xi) are the parent nodes of Xi in the graph.\n\nSo, I need to identify the parent nodes for each variable in my network: H, U, P, W.\n\nStarting with H, does H have any parents? Looking at the diagram: H -> U <- P <- W. There are no arrows pointing to H, so H has no parents. Therefore, P(H) is just P(H).\n\nNext, U has two parents: H and P, since H -> U and P -> U. So, P(U | H, P).\n\nThen, P has one parent: W, because W -> P.\n\nFinally, W has no parents, as there are no arrows pointing to W.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the joint probability should be:\n\nP(H, U, P, W) = P(H) * P(W) * P(P | W) * P(U | H, P)\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. P(H, U, P, W) = P(H) * P(W) * P(P) * P(U)\n\nThis seems incorrect because it doesn't account for the conditional dependencies. It multiplies P(H), P(W), P(P), and P(U), but P(P) should be conditioned on W, and P(U) should be conditioned on H and P.\n\nB. P(H, U, P, W) = P(H) * P(W) * P(P | W) * P(W | H, P)\n\nThis has P(W | H, P), which doesn't make sense because W is a parent of P but not directly connected to H or U. So, this seems wrong.\n\nC. P(H, U, P, W) = P(H) * P(W) * P(P | W) * P(U | H, P)\n\nThis matches exactly what I derived earlier.\n\nD. None of the above\n\nSince C matches my derivation, D is incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In Bayesian networks, the joint probability is indeed the product of the conditional probabilities of each node given its parents.\n\nGiven that:\n\n- H has no parents: P(H)\n\n- W has no parents: P(W)\n\n- P has parent W: P(P | W)\n\n- U has parents H and P: P(U | H, P)\n\nMultiplying these together gives the joint probability P(H, U, P, W).\n\nOption C correctly represents this factorization.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
