                    "text": "So I've got this question here about a researcher who found that age is negatively correlated with cigarette smoking. I need to figure out what that means exactly. The options are:\n\nA. Older adults experience more negative effects from smoking than do younger adults.\n\nB. Older adults smoke more than younger adults.\n\nC. Older adults smoke less than younger adults.\n\nD. Older and younger adults smoke about the same number of cigarettes and both experience negative effects.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what a negative correlation means. In statistics, correlation measures the relationship between two variables. A negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases. So, in this case, if age is negatively correlated with cigarette smoking, that suggests that as age increases, smoking decreases.\n\nLet me think about that. If older adults are smoking less than younger adults, that would align with a negative correlation. So, option C seems to suggest that. But let's look at the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A says older adults experience more negative effects from smoking than younger adults. Well, that might be true, but the correlation is about the amount of smoking, not about the health impacts. So, this seems like a different concept.\n\nOption B says older adults smoke more than younger adults. That would imply a positive correlation between age and smoking, which contradicts the negative correlation mentioned in the question.\n\nOption D says older and younger adults smoke about the same number of cigarettes and both experience negative effects. This suggests no significant difference in smoking habits between age groups, which doesn't align with the idea of a negative correlation.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems to be the correct interpretation of a negative correlation between age and smoking. Older adults smoke less than younger adults.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other context that could change this interpretation. For example, perhaps in certain cultures or time periods, smoking habits differ among age groups in more complex ways. However, the question presents a straightforward negative correlation, so I think the simplest and most accurate conclusion is that older adults smoke less than younger adults.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to look at it from a statistical perspective. If we plot age against the number of cigarettes smoked, a negative correlation would show a downward-sloping line, meaning that higher ages correspond with lower smoking rates.\n\nI should also consider if there are any confounding variables that might affect this relationship. For instance, perhaps older adults have different reasons for smoking or different access to cigarettes compared to younger adults. But again, the question is specifically about the correlation found by the researcher, not about the causes behind the correlation.\n\nSo, all things considered, I believe the answer is C. Older adults smoke less than younger adults.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
