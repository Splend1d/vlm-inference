Short on funds and needing a way to get to the training facilities, the athlete approached his friend and said, \"If you will drive me to and from the baseball team's training facilities for my tryout and pay for our housing and meal expenses during our stay, I will assign to you 10 percent of my first-year earnings. \" The friend agreed and drove the athlete to the training facilities. After the tryout, the baseball team offered the athlete a contract to play baseball for the team at $100,000 per year. When the friend asked when he would be receiving his 10 percent, the athlete replied that $10,000 was much more than the friend deserved and he would pay the friend $1,000 for his efforts.

                    "text": "So I've got this situation here where an athlete wants to go to a baseball team's training facilities for a tryout. He's short on funds, so he makes a deal with his friend: if the friend pays for the trip and expenses, the athlete will give the friend 10% of his first-year earnings if he gets a contract. The friend agrees, drives him to the tryout, and the athlete lands a $100,000 per year contract. But then the athlete tries to back out of the deal, offering only $1,000 instead of the agreed $10,000. The friend sues to enforce the assignment, and the court rules that the assignment is unenforceable. I need to figure out which legal principle is most applicable here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an assignment is. An assignment is when one person transfers their rights under a contract to another person. So in this case, the athlete is promising to transfer 10% of his first-year earnings to his friend.\n\nOption A says that if someone tries to assign a right that's expected to arise under a contract that doesn't yet exist, it's basically just a promise to assign it later and a power to enforce it. So, if the athlete is promising to assign 10% of earnings from a contract that hasn't been signed yet, this might apply.\n\nOption B states that a contract to make a future assignment of a right isn't validly enforceable. This seems similar to option A but perhaps more direct. It suggests that agreeing to assign something in the future isn't enough to create an enforceable assignment.\n\nOption C mentions that the friend didn't detrimentally rely on the assignment before the athlete tried to revoke it. Detrimental reliance is when someone changes their position based on a promise, to their detriment. If the friend did something different because of the promise, like quit a job or spend money, and the athlete revokes the assignment, that could be an issue. But the problem says the court ruled the assignment unenforceable, so maybe this isn't the main point.\n\nOption D talks about gratuitous assignments being revocable. A gratuitous assignment is one where there's no consideration given for the assignment. Consideration is something of value exchanged between parties. If the friend didn't give anything in return for the assignment, then the athlete could revoke it.\n\nBut in this scenario, the friend did provide something: he paid for the trip and expenses. So, there was consideration for the assignment. That means it's not a gratuitous assignment; it's a bargained-for exchange.\n\nLet me think about this again. The athlete promised to give 10% of his earnings in exchange for the friend paying for the trip and expenses. So, there's consideration on both sides: the friend pays for the trip, and the athlete promises to give 10% of his earnings.\n\nNow, the court ruled the assignment unenforceable. Why might that be?\n\nMaybe because the right to the earnings hasn't yet come into existence when the agreement was made. The athlete was promising to assign 10% of his first-year earnings from a contract that didn't yet exist. So, he was promising to assign something that might or might not happen in the future.\n\nOption A seems to suggest that such a promise operates only as a promise to assign it when it arises and as a power to enforce it. That might mean that until the contract exists and the right to earnings arises, the assignment isn't fully effective.\n\nOption B says that a contract to make a future assignment isn't enforceable. That seems straightforward. If the athlete is only promising to assign something in the future, that promise isn't enough to create an enforceable assignment now.\n\nBut in this case, the athlete and the friend had a bargain: the friend pays for the trip, and the athlete promises to give 10% of his earnings. So, there's consideration on both sides.\n\nMaybe the issue is that the right to the earnings didn't exist yet. The athlete didn't have a contract, so he couldn't assign something from that contract before it was signed.\n\nWait, but he's promising to assign it if he gets the contract. So, it's conditional. The assignment is contingent on him getting the contract.\n\nBut assignments are generally of existing rights. Assigning future rights can be tricky because those rights might not come into being.\n\nOption A seems to suggest that such an assignment is more of a promise to assign it when the right arises, rather than an immediate assignment.\n\nOption B says that a contract to make a future assignment isn't enforceable. That might be the case here. The athlete is making a promise to assign something in the future, but that promise isn't enforceable.\n\nBut in this scenario, there was consideration. The friend paid for the trip and expenses in exchange for the promise to assign 10% of the earnings.\n\nMaybe the court thinks that the assignment isn't valid because the right to the earnings didn't exist yet, and therefore, the assignment is just a promise to assign it later, which isn't enforceable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the court thinks that the assignment is revocable because it's of a future right.\n\nBut the athlete and the friend had a deal: the friend pays for the trip, and the athlete gives 10% of his earnings. That seems like a bargained-for exchange.\n\nOption D mentions that a gratuitous assignment is revocable. But this isn't a gratuitous assignment because there was consideration\u2014the friend paid for the trip.\n\nSo, maybe option D isn't applicable here.\n\nOption C talks about detrimental reliance. The friend did something (paid for the trip) based on the promise to assign 10% of the earnings. If the athlete revokes the assignment after the friend has already paid, the friend has relied on the promise to his detriment.\n\nBut the court ruled the assignment unenforceable, not that the athlete revoked it. Although the athlete offered only $1,000 instead of $10,000, which could be seen as a revocation or a material breach of the agreement.\n\nWait, perhaps the court is saying that the assignment itself is unenforceable, not that the athlete revoked it.\n\nSo, maybe the most applicable legal principle is option B: a contract to make a future assignment of a right is not a validly enforceable assignment.\n\nThis seems to fit because the athlete was promising to assign something from a contract that didn't yet exist. The right to the earnings didn't exist yet, so the promise to assign it is not enforceable.\n\nOption A is similar but seems a bit more nuanced, suggesting that it's more of a promise to assign when the right arises.\n\nBut the court ruled the assignment unenforceable, so option B seems directly on point.\n\nOption C doesn't seem to fit because the friend did act on the promise by paying for the trip, but the court is ruling on the enforceability of the assignment, not on detrimental reliance.\n\nOption D doesn't apply because this isn't a gratuitous assignment; there was consideration.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. a contract to make a future assignment of a right is not a validly enforceable assignment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
