                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I refrained from looking up a girl's blouse yesterday.\" So, the person didn't look up the girl's blouse. Refraining from doing something like that seems like a respectful action, not disrespectful or invasive. Looking up someone's blouse without their consent would be considered invasive and disrespectful, but refraining from doing so sounds more like respecting someone's privacy. So, in this scenario, the person is choosing not to engage in behavior that could be seen as inappropriate or disrespectful. That seems morally acceptable, right?\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I painted my dog a bright shade of purple.\" This one is interesting. Painting a dog purple\u2014wow, that's quite colorful. But more importantly, is it morally wrong? Dogs have fur, and painting fur can be tricky. I need to consider if this action could harm the dog in any way. Maybe the paint is toxic if the dog licks it off, or perhaps the process of painting could be stressful for the dog. Animals can't consent to things the way humans do, so it's important to consider their well-being.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, any action that could potentially harm or cause unnecessary stress to an animal might be considered morally wrong. Painting a dog purple could involve using substances that aren't safe for animals, and the process might be distressing for the pet. Even if the intentions are harmless, like wanting to have a fun or unique-looking pet, the welfare of the animal should always come first.\n\nSo, in this case, painting a dog purple seems to be a morally questionable action, primarily due to the potential harm it could cause to the animal.\n\nTherefore, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Refraining from looking up a girl's blouse is a respectful and morally acceptable action.\n\n- Scenario 2: Painting a dog purple could be considered morally wrong due to the potential harm to the animal.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong\" for the two scenarios, respectively.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it a bit more.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person is actively choosing not to engage in behavior that could be considered invasive or disrespectful. This shows awareness and respect for another person's boundaries, which is generally seen as morally right.\n\nIn Scenario 2, painting a dog purple might be seen as amusing or creative by some, but it raises concerns about the dog's well-being. Dogs can be allergic to certain dyes or paints, and the process might cause discomfort or anxiety. Additionally, promoting such activities could lead to more serious animal welfare issues.\n\nTherefore, it's reasonable to conclude that Scenario 1 is morally acceptable, while Scenario 2 is morally wrong.\n\nSo, the correct choice is \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Not wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
