                    "text": "Let's see what happens to the image formed by a concave mirror as the object is moved from far away to near the focal point. I need to choose between four options:\n\nA. The image moves away from the mirror and gets shorter.\n\nB. The image moves away from the mirror and gets taller.\n\nC. The image moves toward the mirror and gets shorter.\n\nD. The image moves toward the mirror and gets taller.\n\nFirst, I should recall some basic properties of concave mirrors. Concave mirrors are curved inward and can form both real and virtual images depending on the object distance.\n\nI remember that for a concave mirror, the image position can be determined using the mirror formula:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{d_o} + \\frac{1}{d_i}\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(f\\) is the focal length of the mirror,\n\n- \\(d_o\\) is the object distance from the mirror,\n\n- \\(d_i\\) is the image distance from the mirror.\n\nAlso, the magnification \\(m\\) of the image is given by:\n\n\\[m = -\\frac{d_i}{d_o}\\]\n\nThe magnification tells us the size of the image relative to the object and also indicates whether the image is inverted or upright.\n\nNow, let's think about what happens as the object is moved from far away (infinity) towards the focal point.\n\n1. When the object is at infinity (\\(d_o \\rightarrow \\infty\\)):\n\nPlugging into the mirror formula:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{\\infty} + \\frac{1}{d_i} \\implies \\frac{1}{f} = 0 + \\frac{1}{d_i} \\implies d_i = f\\]\n\nSo, the image is at the focal point, and using the magnification formula:\n\n\\[m = -\\frac{f}{\\infty} = 0\\]\n\nThis means the image is infinitely small, essentially a point image.\n\n2. When the object is moved closer to the mirror, but still outside the focal point (\\(d_o > f\\)):\n\nFrom the mirror formula:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{d_o} + \\frac{1}{d_i} \\implies \\frac{1}{d_i} = \\frac{1}{f} - \\frac{1}{d_o}\\]\n\nAs \\(d_o\\) decreases (object moves closer to the mirror), \\(\\frac{1}{d_o}\\) increases, so \\(\\frac{1}{d_i}\\) decreases. This means \\(d_i\\) increases, i.e., the image moves away from the mirror.\n\nNow, for the magnification:\n\n\\[m = -\\frac{d_i}{d_o}\\]\n\nSince both \\(d_i\\) increases and \\(d_o\\) decreases, the magnitude of \\(m\\) increases, meaning the image gets taller.\n\n3. When the object is at the focal point (\\(d_o = f\\)):\n\nPlugging into the mirror formula:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{f} + \\frac{1}{d_i} \\implies \\frac{1}{d_i} = \\frac{1}{f} - \\frac{1}{f} = 0 \\implies d_i = \\infty\\]\n\nThis means the rays are parallel and never converge to a point. In practice, this might not be achievable, but theoretically, the image is at infinity.\n\n4. When the object is between the focal point and the mirror (\\(d_o < f\\)):\n\nFrom the mirror formula:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{d_o} + \\frac{1}{d_i} \\implies \\frac{1}{d_i} = \\frac{1}{f} - \\frac{1}{d_o}\\]\n\nSince \\(d_o < f\\), \\(\\frac{1}{d_o} > \\frac{1}{f}\\), so \\(\\frac{1}{d_i}\\) would be negative, meaning \\(d_i\\) is negative. A negative image distance indicates a virtual image, which is on the same side as the object.\n\nFor the magnification:\n\n\\[m = -\\frac{d_i}{d_o}\\]\n\nSince \\(d_i\\) is negative, \\(m\\) is positive, meaning the image is upright. Also, as \\(d_o\\) decreases, \\(d_i\\) decreases in magnitude, so the image generally gets larger.\n\nBut in this case, since \\(d_o\\) is decreasing towards the focal point, and \\(d_i\\) is negative and increasing in magnitude, the image is getting larger.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- As the object moves from far away (\\(d_o \\rightarrow \\infty\\)) towards the focal point (\\(d_o = f\\)), the image moves from the focal point towards infinity, and the image size increases.\n\n- Beyond the focal point (\\(d_o < f\\)), the image is virtual and continues to get larger as the object approaches the mirror.\n\nTherefore, the general trend is that the image moves away from the mirror and gets taller as the object moves from far away towards the focal point.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be:\n\nB. The image moves away from the mirror and gets taller.\n\nLet me double-check this conclusion with a simple example.\n\nSuppose we have a concave mirror with a focal length of \\(f = 20\\) cm.\n\n1. Object at \\(d_o = 100\\) cm:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{20} = \\frac{1}{100} + \\frac{1}{d_i} \\implies \\frac{1}{d_i} = \\frac{1}{20} - \\frac{1}{100} = \\frac{5}{100} - \\frac{1}{100} = \\frac{4}{100} \\implies d_i = 25 \\text{ cm}\\]\n\nMagnification:\n\n\\[m = -\\frac{25}{100} = -0.25\\]\n\nImage is inverted and smaller.\n\n2. Object at \\(d_o = 30\\) cm:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{20} = \\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{1}{d_i} \\implies \\frac{1}{d_i} = \\frac{1}{20} - \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{3}{60} - \\frac{2}{60} = \\frac{1}{60} \\implies d_i = 60 \\text{ cm}\\]\n\nMagnification:\n\n\\[m = -\\frac{60}{30} = -2\\]\n\nImage is inverted and larger.\n\n3. Object at \\(d_o = 15\\) cm (between focal point and mirror, \\(f = 20\\) cm):\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{20} = \\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{1}{d_i} \\implies \\frac{1}{d_i} = \\frac{1}{20} - \\frac{1}{15} = \\frac{3}{60} - \\frac{4}{60} = -\\frac{1}{60} \\implies d_i = -60 \\text{ cm}\\]\n\nMagnification:\n\n\\[m = -\\frac{-60}{15} = 4\\]\n\nImage is upright and larger.\n\nFrom this, as the object moves from \\(d_o = 100\\) cm to \\(d_o = 30\\) cm to \\(d_o = 15\\) cm, the image moves from \\(d_i = 25\\) cm to \\(d_i = 60\\) cm to \\(d_i = -60\\) cm, which is effectively moving away from the mirror (considering the positive direction).\n\nThe magnification increases from 0.25 to 2 to 4, meaning the image gets taller.\n\nTherefore, the answer is indeed:\n\nB. The image moves away from the mirror and gets taller.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
