There are two nested loops here, and I need to figure out how many times the innermost statement, `result \u2190 result + 1`, is executed. The variable `y` is a positive integer, like 1, 2, 3, and so on. I need to express this in terms of `y`.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the outer loop: \"REPEAT 3 TIMES { ... }\". So, this outer loop runs 3 times. No matter what `y` is, the outer loop always runs 3 times.\n\nNow, inside the outer loop, there's an inner loop: \"REPEAT y TIMES { result \u2190 result + 1 }\". So, for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs `y` times, and each time it runs, it adds 1 to the `result`.\n\nSo, if the outer loop runs 3 times, and for each of those times, the inner loop runs `y` times, adding 1 each time, then the total number of times `result` is increased by 1 should be 3 times `y`.\n\nWait, let's think about that again. For each of the 3 iterations of the outer loop, the inner loop runs `y` times, and each time it adds 1 to `result`. So, yes, total times `result` is increased by 1 should be 3 times `y`, which is `3y`.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. y + 3\n\nB. 3y\n\nC. y^3\n\nD. 3^y\n\nSo, option B. 3y seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check with an example. Suppose y = 2.\n\nThen, the outer loop runs 3 times.\n\nFor each of those 3 times, the inner loop runs 2 times, adding 1 each time.\n\nSo, total additions should be 3 times 2, which is 6.\n\nSo, result should be increased by 6.\n\nIs there any other way to interpret this?\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if there are any starting values or anything else, but the problem starts with `result \u2190 0`, so `result` starts at 0, and we're just adding 1, y times, 3 times.\n\nSo, yes, final result should be 3y.\n\nAlternatively, if there was another layer or different structure, but in this case, it's just two nested loops with constant repetitions.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. 3y.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
