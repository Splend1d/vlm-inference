The treaty, which was ratified by the Senate, was supported by professional baseball and hockey players. Many Canadian hockey players, who were employed by American teams and lived in the United States during the hockey season, lobbied for passage of the treaty, since they were subject to the payment of both U. S. and Canadian income taxes. In like manner, many American baseball players, who lived in Canada during the baseball season, objected to the same dual taxation. In violation of the treaty, a Canadian court convicted a U. S. citizen who resided in Canada, of illegally evading the payment of Canadian income taxes. The U. S. citizen, who was a member of a Canadian baseball team, resided in Canada during the baseball season. Following his conviction, the President announced that the previously effective tax treaty would no longer be abided by the United States. The President proclaimed that Canada's refusal to honor the treaty rendered it invalid. As a result, the President ordered the Internal Revenue Service to begin collecting income taxes from Canadian citizens residing in the United States in the same manner that it collects taxes from other residents of this country. A Canadian citizen and resident of the United States, sues in an appropriate federal court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the treaty with Canada remains valid and effective. Therefore, he contends that the Internal Revenue Service may not collect U. S. income taxes from him.

                    "text": "Alright, I've got this scenario about a tax treaty between the United States and Canada. So, after months of negotiations, they came up with a tax treaty that says neither country will impose income taxes on citizens of the other nation. This treaty was ratified by the Senate, which I believe is necessary for international treaties in the U.S., right? Because the President can negotiate treaties, but they need Senate approval to be ratified.\n\nNow, this treaty was supported by professional baseball and hockey players because many Canadian hockey players work for American teams and live in the U.S. during the hockey season, and American baseball players live in Canada during the baseball season. So, they were facing dual taxation from both countries, which makes sense because both countries would want to tax the income earned within their borders.\n\nBut then, in violation of this treaty, a Canadian court convicted a U.S. citizen who lives in Canada during the baseball season for evading Canadian income taxes. This U.S. citizen is a member of a Canadian baseball team. So, even though the treaty says that Canada shouldn't impose income taxes on U.S. citizens, they did anyway.\n\nAs a result of this, the President of the U.S. announced that the tax treaty would no longer be followed by the United States. The President said that since Canada isn't honoring the treaty, the U.S. won't either. So, the President ordered the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to start collecting income taxes from Canadian citizens residing in the U.S., just like they do from other U.S. residents.\n\nNow, a Canadian citizen who lives in the U.S. is suing in federal court, asking for a declaratory judgment that the treaty is still valid and that the IRS can't collect U.S. income taxes from him. He's arguing that the treaty remains in effect and that the IRS shouldn't be able to tax him based on it.\n\nThe question is asking which of the following options is the strongest constitutional basis for this claim.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. The President's unilateral termination of a treaty benefiting residents of the United States cannot be effective until a hearing is afforded to persons who would be affected by such action.\n\nSo, this option is suggesting that the President can't just terminate the treaty on his own and that there needs to be some sort of hearing or process to consider the impact on people affected by the termination. This seems like a due process argument, where individuals have a right to be heard before their rights are taken away.\n\nB. The courts have exclusive authority to determine whether a particular treaty has, in fact, been breached by another nation.\n\nThis option is asserting that only the courts can decide if a treaty has been violated, not the executive branch. So, the President can't just say that Canada violated the treaty and therefore it's terminated. Instead, a court needs to make that determination.\n\nC. A ratified treaty is the supreme law of the land and, therefore, remains effective until superseded by another treaty or statute.\n\nThis option is referencing the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which states that treaties ratified by the Senate are the \"supreme Law of the Land.\" So, unless there's another treaty or a statute that overrides it, the treaty should remain in effect.\n\nD. The treaty created a property right in Canadian citizens residing in the United States that cannot be taken away without just compensation.\n\nThis option is suggesting that the treaty gave Canadian citizens a property right not to be taxed by the U.S., and that right can't be taken away without compensation. This sounds like a takings clause argument from the Fifth Amendment.\n\nNow, I need to determine which of these is the strongest constitutional basis for the Canadian citizen's claim that the treaty remains valid and that the IRS shouldn't collect taxes from him.\n\nFirst, let's consider option A. Is there a requirement for a hearing before the President can terminate a treaty? I know that the President has the power to negotiate and terminate treaties, but I'm not sure if there's a due process requirement for individuals who might be affected by such a termination. Maybe there is, but I'm not entirely confident about that.\n\nOption B says that only the courts can determine if a treaty has been breached. That seems plausible because in the U.S. legal system, courts are often the arbiters of legal disputes, including international ones. However, I wonder if the executive branch has some role in determining treaty violations, especially since they are responsible for foreign relations.\n\nOption C references the Supremacy Clause, which is found in Article VI of the Constitution. It states that \"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land.\" So, according to this clause, once a treaty is ratified, it becomes the supreme law of the land, meaning it takes precedence over state laws and, in some cases, federal laws.\n\nTherefore, unless there's another treaty or a statute that overrides this particular treaty, it should remain in effect. In this scenario, the President unilaterally decided to stop abiding by the treaty because Canada violated it by taxing a U.S. citizen. But according to option C, that's not enough to terminate the treaty; it would require another treaty or a statute to supersede it.\n\nThis seems like a strong argument. The Supremacy Clause is a fundamental principle of the Constitution, and treaties are explicitly mentioned as part of the supreme law of the land.\n\nNow, option D suggests that the treaty created a property right for Canadian citizens not to be taxed by the U.S., and that this right can't be taken away without just compensation. While it's possible that certain treaty provisions could create property rights, I'm not sure if\u514d\u9664 from taxation is considered a property right in the same way that owning physical property is. It might be a liberty interest, but I'm not certain about that.\n\nMoreover, the Takings Clause generally applies to real or personal property, not to intangible rights like exemption from taxation. So, I'm a bit skeptical about this argument, at least in the context of taxation treaties.\n\nComparing the four options, option C seems to be the strongest constitutional basis. The Supremacy Clause is a clear and direct provision of the Constitution, establishing treaties as the supreme law of the land. Unless there's a conflicting treaty or statute, the existing treaty should remain in effect.\n\nOption A is about due process in terminating treaties, which might be an important consideration, but it's not as directly supported by the Constitution as the Supremacy Clause.\n\nOption B is about the role of the courts in determining treaty breaches. While courts do have a role in interpreting treaties, I don't think they have exclusive authority to determine if a treaty has been breached. The executive branch, which conducts foreign relations, also has a role in this.\n\nOption D is tenuous because it's not clear that exemption from taxation constitutes a property right under the Takings Clause.\n\nTherefore, the strongest constitutional basis for the Canadian citizen's claim is option C: a ratified treaty is the supreme law of the land and remains effective until superseded by another treaty or statute.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
