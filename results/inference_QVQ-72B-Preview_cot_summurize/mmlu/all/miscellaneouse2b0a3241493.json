                    "text": "So I have this question: \"Elephant tusks are made of what material? A. Coral, B. Ivory, C. Bone, D. Calcium.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that elephants have tusks, which are like their enlarged incisor teeth. They're big and white and stick out from either side of their trunks. But what are they made of exactly?\n\nOption A is coral. I know coral is something found in oceans, like coral reefs. It's made up of calcium carbonate and is secreted by coral polyps. But elephants live on land, so it seems unlikely that their tusks are made of coral. Maybe elephants ate coral or something? That doesn't make much sense. So, I think coral is probably not the right answer.\n\nOption B is ivory. I've heard of ivory being associated with elephants, especially African elephants, which have large tusks that are often poached for their ivory. Ivory is valued for its hardness and suitability for carving into ornaments or artwork. But is ivory just another name for something else, like bone or tooth enamel?\n\nWait a minute, ivory is indeed a type of dental tissue. It's primarily composed of dentin, which is also found in our teeth, but it's denser and harder in ivory. So, ivory is essentially a form of dentin modified for strength and durability. Given that tusks are enlarged teeth, it makes sense that they would be made of ivory.\n\nOption C is bone. Bones are part of the skeletal structure of animals, including elephants. They provide support and protection. However, tusks are not part of the skeleton; they are modified teeth. So, while bones and ivory are both hard tissues found in animals, they serve different purposes and are located in different parts of the body.\n\nOption D is calcium. Calcium is a mineral that is essential for many biological processes in animals, including bone and tooth formation. It's a key component of both bone and ivory. However, calcium by itself isn't the primary material that makes up tusks. Ivory contains calcium, but it also contains other components like proteins and water.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Coral: found in oceans, not in elephants.\n\n- Ivory: known to be part of elephant tusks.\n\n- Bone: part of the skeleton, not the tusks.\n\n- Calcium: a component of ivory, but not the primary material.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Ivory.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any possibility that tusks could be considered as bone. In some animals, horns and antlers are made of bone or similar materials, but in elephants, tusks are definitely modified incisor teeth. So, no, I don't think tusks are bones.\n\nAlso, I recall that in some contexts, the term \"ivory\" can be used more broadly to refer to any hard, white material from animals, but in the case of elephants, it's specifically dental ivory.\n\nAnother point: there are different types of ivory. For example, walruses have tusks made of ivory, and so do narwhals and some boars. But again, in elephants, it's their ivory that's famous and unfortunately sought after by poachers.\n\nI should also mention that elephants have two pairs of tusks, although in African elephants, both males and females typically have tusks, whereas in Asian elephants, usually only males have them. But the material is still ivory in both cases.\n\nMoreover, ivory has a distinct structure. It's composed mostly of dentin, with small canals containing odontoblasts, which are cells that produce dentin. This structure gives ivory its characteristic appearance and properties.\n\nIn contrast, bone has a different composition and structure, involving osteons and Haversian systems, which are not present in ivory.\n\nAdditionally, ivory is harder and denser than bone, which makes it more suitable for the functions tusks serve in elephants, such as digging, stripping bark, and in males, fighting.\n\nFurthermore, ivory doesn't have nerves or blood vessels running through it, unlike teeth, which do have pulp chambers. This is because ivory is continuously deposited throughout the elephant's life, and the pulp recedes as the tusk grows.\n\nWait, actually, I think I might be confusing some facts here. Let me double-check.\n\nUpon a quick search in my memory, I recall that elephant tusks do have a pulp cavity when they're young, but as the tusk grows, the pulp cavity becomes smaller and may eventually close off. However, there might still be some vascular supply near the base of the tusk.\n\nBut regardless of that, the primary material of the tusk is still ivory, which is dentin.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that ivory is valued for its aesthetic qualities and has been used in various cultural artifacts throughout history. This has unfortunately led to the illegal ivory trade, which threatens elephant populations.\n\nBut getting back to the question, it's clear that the material of elephant tusks is ivory.\n\nSo, to conclude, the correct answer is B. Ivory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. Ivory}} \\]"
