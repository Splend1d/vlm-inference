                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this scenario about Conrad and his study habits leading up to finals, and then he gets the flu right after exams. The question is asking which theory best explains this chain of events. The options are Selye's general adaptation syndrome, Yerkes-Dodson law, Thorndike's law of effect, and Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory. Hmm, I need to recall what each of these theories is about and see which one fits the situation best.\n\nFirst, let's think about Selye's general adaptation syndrome. I remember that this is a model that describes the stages of stress response in the body. There are three stages: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion. Basically, when you're faced with stress, your body initially reacts with a fight-or-flight response (alarm), then it tries to adapt and resist the stressor (resistance), and if the stress continues, it can lead to exhaustion where the body can't keep up anymore. Maybe this relates to Conrad's situation because he's been under a lot of stress from studying for finals, which could put his body through these stages, and getting the flu could be a result of his immune system being weakened during the exhaustion phase.\n\nNext, there's the Yerkes-Dodson law. I think this is about the relationship between stress (or arousal) and performance. It suggests that there's an optimal level of arousal for best performance, and either too little or too much arousal can decrease performance. So, if Conrad was studying for hours each day, he might have been under a lot of stress, which could have affected his performance on the exams or his health in general. But the flu seems more related to his physical health rather than his academic performance, so maybe this isn't the best fit.\n\nThen there's Thorndike's law of effect. I recall that this is a learning theory that suggests behaviors followed by positive consequences are more likely to be repeated, while those followed by negative consequences are less likely to be repeated. In Conrad's case, he studied hard and then took finals, and then got the flu. It's not clear what the direct consequence of his studying is in relation to getting the flu. Unless he associates studying with getting sick, which might not be the case, this theory might not explain the chain of events here.\n\nLastly, there's Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory. This is about the discomfort we feel when we hold two inconsistent beliefs or behaviors, and how we try to reduce that discomfort. In Conrad's situation, maybe he was stressed about the exams and studying so much, and then getting the flu could be seen as a physical manifestation of that stress. But I'm not sure if that directly fits into cognitive dissonance.\n\nComparing all four, Selye's general adaptation syndrome seems to be the most straightforward fit. The stress from studying and preparing for finals could have put Conrad's body through the stages of the stress response, potentially leading to a weakened immune system right after the exams, which allowed him to get the flu. It makes sense that his body was so focused on dealing with the stress that his immune system was compromised, making him more susceptible to illnesses like the flu.\n\nI think the answer is A. Selye's general adaptation syndrome.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
