                    "text": "So I've got this equation here: \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\cdot m = 6 \\). I need to solve for m. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that to solve for a variable in an equation, I need to isolate it. So, I need to get m by itself on one side of the equation. The equation is \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\cdot m = 6 \\). That means that m is being multiplied by \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\). To undo that multiplication, I should divide both sides of the equation by \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\).\n\nSo, starting with:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5}{8} \\cdot m = 6 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\):\n\n\\[ m = 6 \\div \\frac{5}{8} \\]\n\nNow, dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\) is \\( \\frac{8}{5} \\). So, I can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[ m = 6 \\cdot \\frac{8}{5} \\]\n\nMultiplying 6 and \\( \\frac{8}{5} \\), I need to think about how to handle the multiplication of a whole number and a fraction. I can think of 6 as \\( \\frac{6}{1} \\), so:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{6}{1} \\cdot \\frac{8}{5} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 8}{1 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{48}{5} \\]\n\nNow, \\( \\frac{48}{5} \\) can be expressed as a mixed number. Dividing 48 by 5 gives me 9 with a remainder of 3, so:\n\n\\[ \\frac{48}{5} = 9 \\frac{3}{5} \\]\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 3 and 5 over 9\n\nB. 3 and 3 over 4\n\nC. 5 and 1 over 3\n\nD. 9 and 3 over 5\n\nSo, my answer matches option D. 9 and 3 over 5.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Let's see.\n\nAnother method could be to cross-multiply, but since it's an equation involving fractions, the first method seems more straightforward and correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the division back into multiplication to verify.\n\nGiven that \\( m = 6 \\div \\frac{5}{8} \\), and knowing that dividing by \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\) is the same as multiplying by \\( \\frac{8}{5} \\), which is what I did, I think it's correct.\n\nAnother thought: maybe I can check by plugging the value back into the original equation.\n\nSo, if \\( m = 9 \\frac{3}{5} \\), first I need to convert it to an improper fraction to make calculations easier.\n\n\\[ 9 \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{9 \\cdot 5 + 3}{5} = \\frac{45 + 3}{5} = \\frac{48}{5} \\]\n\nNow, plug this back into the original equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5}{8} \\cdot m = \\frac{5}{8} \\cdot \\frac{48}{5} \\]\n\nMultiplying these fractions:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5 \\cdot 48}{8 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{240}{40} = 6 \\]\n\nSo, it checks out. The solution is indeed \\( m = 9 \\frac{3}{5} \\), which corresponds to option D.\n\nI don't think there's any other way this could be interpreted, and the math seems solid. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
