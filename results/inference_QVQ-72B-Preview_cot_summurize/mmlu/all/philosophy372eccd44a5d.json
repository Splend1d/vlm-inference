                    "text": "Brandt's theory is about finding the best moral rules. He thinks that the best rules are those that, if everyone followed them, would make things go best overall. Now, utility is about how good or bad things are. Positive utility is like good stuff, and negative utility is bad stuff.\n\nSo, the question is asking what kind of rule would be ideal according to Brandt. It gives four options:\n\nA. Maximize positive utility, but ignore negative utility.\n\nB. Minimize negative utility, but ignore positive utility.\n\nC. Maximize utility, considering both positive and negative utilities.\n\nD. Don't consider either positive or negative utility.\n\nHmm, that last one seems odd. If we don't consider positive or negative utility, then what do we consider? Maybe something else, but the question is about utility.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nFirst, utilitarianism is a theory that says we should maximize overall happiness or utility. So, it's about maximizing the good and minimizing the bad.\n\nBut Brandt's theory seems related to rules, not just individual actions.\n\nWait, the question mentions \"an ideal moral rule,\" so it's about rules that guide behavior.\n\nOption C says maximize utility, considering both positive and negative utilities. That sounds like utilitarianism, where you consider both good and bad outcomes and try to maximize the overall good.\n\nOption A suggests maximizing positive utility but ignoring negative utility. That would mean you only care about maximizing good things, regardless of the bad things that might happen. That doesn't sound right because even if you're maximizing good, if you're also causing a lot of bad, it might not be the best overall.\n\nOption B is about minimizing negative utility but ignoring positive utility. So, you're focused on reducing harm, but you don't care about increasing good things. That also seems unbalanced because you could be minimizing harm but also missing out on opportunities to do a lot of good.\n\nOption D says take no account of either positive or negative utility. So, you're not considering the good or bad consequences of following the rule. That seems problematic because moral rules are often meant to guide us towards good outcomes and away from bad ones.\n\nSo, if Brandt's theory is about finding rules that lead to the best overall outcomes, it would make sense to consider both positive and negative utilities and aim to maximize the overall utility.\n\nWait, but the question says \"an ideal moral rule is one that would...,\" and the options are about maximizing or minimizing utility.\n\nLet me see if I can find more information about Brandt's theory.\n\nRichard Brandt was a philosopher who worked on moral theory, particularly on rule utilitarianism.\n\nRule utilitarianism is the idea that the best moral rules are those whose general adoption would lead to the greatest good for the greatest number.\n\nSo, unlike act utilitarianism, which looks at each individual action and its consequences, rule utilitarianism looks at the consequences of following certain rules in general.\n\nSo, in Brandt's view, the ideal moral rule would be one that, if everyone followed it, would result in the maximum overall utility.\n\nThat sounds like option C: maximize utility, with both positive and negative utilities being counted.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption A: maximize positive utility, ignoring negative utility. That could lead to situations where, yes, you're maximizing good things, but you're also causing a lot of harm, which would offset the good. So, that doesn't seem ideal.\n\nOption B: minimize negative utility, ignoring positive utility. Here, you're focused on reducing harm, but you might be missing out on opportunities to do a lot of good. So, again, not optimal.\n\nOption D: take no account of either positive or negative utility. This seems like moral rules are based on something else, perhaps duty or rights, without considering the consequences. But in Brandt's theory, which is a form of utilitarianism, the focus is on consequences, specifically overall utility.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate choice is option C: maximize utility, with both positive and negative utilities being counted.\n\nThis aligns with the utilitarian principle of maximizing overall happiness or utility, considering both positive and negative aspects.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
