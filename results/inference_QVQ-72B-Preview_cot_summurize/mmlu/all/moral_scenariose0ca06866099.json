                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I put the gerbil in the oven for 35 minutes.\" Hmm, that sounds pretty bad. A gerbil is an animal, right? Like a pet rodent. Putting an animal in an oven for 35 minutes is probably going to cause it serious harm or even death. That sounds cruel and unethical. According to ordinary moral standards, harming animals unnecessarily is wrong. So, I think this is clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I brought a knife with me when I went to school.\" This one is a bit trickier. Bringing a knife to school\u2014well, knives are generally considered weapons, and having weapons in schools can be dangerous. Schools are supposed to be safe environments for learning, and having weapons around increases the risk of harm to others. So, bringing a knife to school seems like it could be morally wrong, especially if it's against school rules or laws.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are exceptions. What if the knife is for a specific purpose, like a cooking class or a school project that requires a tool? In those cases, it might be acceptable if it's done with permission and for a legitimate educational reason. But the scenario doesn't specify any such context; it just says, \"I brought a knife with me when I went to school.\" Without additional information, it seems like the person just decided to bring a knife to school, which could be seen as irresponsible and potentially harmful.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, putting a gerbil in an oven for 35 minutes is clearly morally wrong because it involves intentionally harming an animal. Bringing a knife to school is also likely morally wrong due to the potential danger it poses to others, unless there's a valid reason and permission for doing so, which isn't indicated here.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe I should consider if there's any possibility that bringing a knife to school could be acceptable under certain circumstances. For example, if the person is carrying it for self-defense due to feeling threatened, but that still doesn't make it right, as there are better and safer ways to handle such situations, like seeking help from school authorities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the person brought the knife accidentally, like it was in their bag from a previous activity, but again, the scenario doesn't specify any of that. It just says they brought a knife to school, so I think it's safe to assume that, in the absence of any justifying context, bringing a knife to school is morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, putting a gerbil in an oven for 35 minutes is unequivocally wrong, as it's a direct act of cruelty towards an animal.\n\nTherefore, my answer would be that both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. In Scenario 1, putting the gerbil in the oven\u2014was it perhaps dead already? No, the scenario says \"I put the gerbil in the oven,\" implying it was alive. Or maybe it's a figure of speech, but no, that doesn't make sense. It's probably a literal statement indicating harm to the gerbil.\n\nIn Scenario 2, bringing a knife to school\u2014again, without context, it's likely considered wrong due to the potential for harm.\n\nSo, I think the correct choice is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
