The options are:\n\nA. It is easy to develop and use.\n\nB. It provides specific information for employee feedback.\n\nC. It helps alleviate leniency and other biases.\n\nD. It provides an objective measure of job performance.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the forced-choice method is. From what I recall, it's a type of performance appraisal where raters are presented with a set of statements and asked to choose which one best describes the employee's performance. These statements are usually designed to be ambiguous or balanced in their wording to prevent raters from being influenced by extreme biases.\n\nNow, let's think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: It is easy to develop and use.\n\nWhile the forced-choice method might be straightforward to use once it's developed, developing it can be time-consuming and requires careful crafting of statements to ensure they are balanced and effective in measuring performance. So, I'm not sure if ease of development is its major advantage.\n\nOption B: It provides specific information for employee feedback.\n\nForced-choice methods do provide specific statements, but the feedback might not be as detailed as other methods like behavioral incident lists or graphic rating scales, which can offer more nuanced descriptions of behavior. So, maybe this isn't the primary advantage.\n\nOption C: It helps alleviate leniency and other biases.\n\nThis sounds promising. One of the main issues with traditional performance appraisal methods is leniency bias, where raters tend to give higher ratings than deserved, or strictness bias, where they give lower ratings. Forced-choice methods are designed to minimize these biases by presenting raters with balanced statements that don't obviously indicate high or low performance levels. This way, raters have to make choices based on actual behavior rather than overall impressions.\n\nOption D: It provides an objective measure of job performance.\n\nWhile forced-choice methods aim for objectivity, no appraisal method is entirely objective. They still rely on raters' judgments and can be subject to some subjectivity, especially in interpreting the statements.\n\nComparing all these options, it seems that the most significant advantage of the forced-choice method is its ability to help alleviate leniency and other biases. So, I think the correct answer is C.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nIs it really easy to develop? Not really; it takes a lot of effort to create balanced statements.\n\nDoes it provide specific information for feedback? Somewhat, but maybe not as specifically as other methods.\n\nDoes it provide an objective measure? It tries to, but it's not entirely objective.\n\nTherefore, the standout advantage is that it helps reduce biases like leniency, which is a big issue in performance appraisals.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. It helps alleviate leniency and other biases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
