                    "text": "So Calvin has this really strong fear of dogs. It's so bad that he can't even go visit friends who have dogs or live in areas where there are a lot of dogs. That must be really tough for him. But he decided to get help, which is great. His counselor helped him overcome this fear in steps. First, he watched his counselor playing with a dog, and then after some time, he actually touched and petted a dog himself. This sounds like a gradual exposure to dogs, starting from something less intimidating to something more direct.\n\nNow, the question is asking what method was used to help Calvin overcome his fears. The options are:\n\nA. countertransference\n\nB. peer-counselor alliance\n\nC. rational-emotive therapy\n\nD. systematic desensitization\n\nI need to figure out which one of these describes what Calvin went through.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nFirst, countertransference. I remember that countertransference is when a therapist's feelings or emotions towards a patient interfere with the therapy. It's kind of the opposite of transference, where the patient projects their feelings onto the therapist. But in this case, it doesn't seem like the counselor's feelings are getting in the way. The counselor is helping Calvin by playing with a dog and encouraging him to interact with dogs. So, this doesn't sound like countertransference. Maybe I should look into it more, but for now, I think it's not the right choice.\n\nNext, peer-counselor alliance. Hmm, I'm not too familiar with this term. Maybe it's about having a counselor who is also a peer, someone around the same age or with similar experiences. But in Calvin's case, the counselor is playing with a dog, which suggests that the counselor might be comfortable with dogs and is using that to help Calvin. Maybe it's about building trust through shared activities. But I'm not sure if this is the main method being used here. Perhaps I should consider other options.\n\nThen there's rational-emotive therapy. I think this is a type of therapy where the therapist helps the patient identify and change irrational beliefs or thoughts that cause emotional distress. For example, if Calvin believes that all dogs are dangerous and will attack him, the therapist would help him see that this belief isn't accurate because not all dogs are dangerous. They might discuss evidence against this belief, like statistics on dog behavior or personal experiences of others. But in the scenario described, it seems more about gradual exposure rather than discussing beliefs. Maybe rational-emotive therapy is part of the process, but the main focus here seems to be on exposure.\n\nLastly, systematic desensitization. This sounds familiar. I think it's a method where a person is gradually exposed to the feared object or situation in a controlled way, starting from something less frightening and progressing to more challenging exposures as they feel more comfortable. This seems to match Calvin's experience pretty well. He started by watching the counselor play with a dog, which is less intense than being directly confronted with a dog. Then, after a while, he progressed to touching and petting a dog himself, which is a bigger step. This gradual increase in exposure is a key part of systematic desensitization.\n\nLet me double-check this. Systematic desensitization often involves a few steps:\n\n1. Relaxation training: learning techniques to manage anxiety.\n\n2. Creating a hierarchy of fears: listing the things that cause fear, ordered from least to most frightening.\n\n3. Gradual exposure: facing these fears one by one, starting from the least frightening and moving up as confidence builds.\n\nIn Calvin's case, watching the counselor with the dog might have been a less frightening exposure compared to petting a dog himself. So, this fits the pattern of systematic desensitization.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the correct answer is D. systematic desensitization.\n\nJust to make sure, let's quickly recap why the other options aren't as suitable:\n\nA. countertransference: This is more about the therapist's reactions interfering with therapy, which isn't described here.\n\nB. peer-counselor alliance: While building a good relationship with the counselor is important, the specific method being used here seems more focused on gradual exposure.\n\nC. rational-emotive therapy: This involves challenging irrational beliefs, but the scenario emphasizes gradual exposure rather than discussion of beliefs.\n\nTherefore, D. systematic desensitization is the most appropriate choice based on the description provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
