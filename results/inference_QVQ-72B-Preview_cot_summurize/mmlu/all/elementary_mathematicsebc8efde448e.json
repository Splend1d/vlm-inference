                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about skip-counting number patterns. The given pattern is 5, 20, 35, 50, 65... and I need to find which option follows the same skip-counting rule. The options are:\n\nA. 5, 20, 25, 30, 35...\n\nB. 13, 18, 23, 28, 33...\n\nC. 12, 27, 42, 57, 72...\n\nD. 15, 30, 40, 55, 65...\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the skip-counting rule is for the given pattern. Skip-counting usually means counting by a certain number, skipping a fixed amount each time. So, for the pattern 5, 20, 35, 50, 65..., I need to see what number I'm counting by.\n\nLet me look at the differences between consecutive numbers:\n\n20 - 5 = 15\n\n35 - 20 = 15\n\n50 - 35 = 15\n\n65 - 50 = 15\n\nSo, the pattern is counting by 15 each time. That means the skip-counting rule is adding 15 to the previous number to get the next number.\n\nNow, I need to look at each option and see which one follows the same rule of adding 15 each time.\n\nOption A: 5, 20, 25, 30, 35...\n\nLet's check the differences:\n\n20 - 5 = 15\n\n25 - 20 = 5\n\n30 - 25 = 5\n\n35 - 30 = 5\n\nHere, after the first difference of 15, the rest are by 5. So, this is not consistent with the given pattern's rule of adding 15 each time.\n\nOption B: 13, 18, 23, 28, 33...\n\nDifferences:\n\n18 - 13 = 5\n\n23 - 18 = 5\n\n28 - 23 = 5\n\n33 - 28 = 5\n\nThis pattern is counting by 5, not by 15. So, not the same as the given pattern's rule.\n\nOption C: 12, 27, 42, 57, 72...\n\nDifferences:\n\n27 - 12 = 15\n\n42 - 27 = 15\n\n57 - 42 = 15\n\n72 - 57 = 15\n\nThis pattern is counting by 15 each time, which matches the given pattern's rule.\n\nOption D: 15, 30, 40, 55, 65...\n\nDifferences:\n\n30 - 15 = 15\n\n40 - 30 = 10\n\n55 - 40 = 15\n\n65 - 55 = 10\n\nThis pattern alternates between adding 15 and 10, so it's not consistently adding 15 each time.\n\nTherefore, among the given options, only Option C follows the same skip-counting rule of adding 15 each time, just like the given pattern.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the general formula for an arithmetic sequence, where each term is generated by adding a constant difference. In this case, the common difference is 15.\n\nSo, for the given pattern: 5, 20, 35, 50, 65...\n\nGeneral term: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\n\nWhere a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the term number.\n\nFor the given pattern, a_1 = 5, d = 15.\n\nSo, a_n = 5 + (n-1)*15\n\nSimilarly, let's check for Option C: 12, 27, 42, 57, 72...\n\nHere, a_1 = 12, d = 15\n\nSo, a_n = 12 + (n-1)*15\n\nLet's verify with n=1: a_1 = 12, which matches the first term.\n\nn=2: a_2 = 12 + (2-1)*15 = 12 + 15 = 27, which matches the second term.\n\nn=3: a_3 = 12 + (3-1)*15 = 12 + 30 = 42, which matches the third term.\n\nn=4: a_4 = 12 + (4-1)*15 = 12 + 45 = 57, which matches the fourth term.\n\nn=5: a_5 = 12 + (5-1)*15 = 12 + 60 = 72, which matches the fifth term.\n\nSo, Option C perfectly follows the same skip-counting rule.\n\nOption A doesn't follow the consistent addition of 15.\n\nOption B is adding 5 each time.\n\nOption D alternates between adding 15 and 10.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option C.\n\nWait, but let's see if there's any trick here. The question says, \"Which number pattern follows the same rule?\" It doesn't necessarily say to choose the one with the same common difference, but specifically the same skip-counting rule.\n\nBut in this context, since skip-counting is about adding a fixed number each time, and the given pattern is counting by 15, then Option C is the one that does that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different skip-counting rule being applied in the options.\n\nBut based on the information given, Option C seems to be the correct choice.\n\nSo, my final answer is Option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
