                    "text": "So I've got this question here about marketing by electronic mail where the recipient has consented to receive the message. The options are search marketing, internet advertising, permission-based email marketing, and social web marketing. I need to pick the one that best describes this scenario.\n\nFirst off, I should understand what each of these terms means. Starting with search marketing, I recall that it involves optimizing a website or paying for placement in search engine results to attract visitors. So, it's more about improving visibility when people search for specific keywords. That doesn't sound exactly like what's being described in the question, which is about sending emails to people who have agreed to receive them.\n\nNext, internet advertising seems pretty broad. It probably encompasses various ways of advertising online, like display ads on websites, ads on social media platforms, and maybe even email ads. But again, the question is specifically about email marketing where the recipient has given consent. So, while internet advertising might include email, it's not the primary focus here.\n\nNow, option C is permission-based email marketing. This sounds spot on. Permission-based email marketing is all about sending promotional emails or newsletters to individuals who have explicitly given their consent to receive such communications. It's a practice that respects the recipient's preferences and helps prevent spam. So, if someone signs up for a newsletter or opts in to receive emails from a company, those emails they receive would fall under this category.\n\nLastly, social web marketing refers to the use of social media platforms to market products or services. This can include posting updates, running ads, or engaging with users on sites like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. While email marketing can be part of a larger social media strategy, it's not the same as social web marketing itself.\n\nGiven these understandings, it seems that permission-based email marketing is the correct answer. It directly aligns with the description provided in the question: marketing via email where the recipient has consented to receive the messages.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think about any possible confusion points. Maybe someone could argue that search marketing could involve emails if, for instance, a company sends emails based on search queries. But that seems like a stretch. Search marketing is more about website optimization and paid search ads, not about email communications.\n\nSimilarly, internet advertising is a broad term that could theoretically include email ads, but it's not specifically about consent-based email communication. Social web marketing is focused on social media, which is distinct from email marketing.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that permission-based email marketing is the accurate term for describing marketing by electronic mail where the recipient has consented to receive the message.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Permission-based email marketing}} \\]"
