                    "text": "Okay, so I have this question about mutations in DNA. It says that mutations are errors in DNA that:\n\nA. are always harmful.\n\nB. only occur in the presence of carcinogens.\n\nC. increase tumor growth.\n\nD. occur spontaneously at a low rate.\n\nAnd I need to pick the correct statement. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that mutations are changes in the DNA sequence. But are they always harmful? I don't think so. Because sometimes, mutations can be beneficial, right? Like, they can lead to new traits that might be advantageous for an organism. So, saying they are always harmful seems too absolute. Maybe A is not correct.\n\nNext, option B says that mutations only occur in the presence of carcinogens. Carcinogens are substances that can cause cancer by damaging DNA or disrupting normal cellular processes. But I recall that mutations can happen spontaneously too, without any external agents. So, mutations aren't only caused by carcinogens. Maybe B is incorrect.\n\nOption C says that mutations increase tumor growth. While it's true that certain mutations can lead to uncontrolled cell division, which can result in tumors, not all mutations lead to tumor growth. In fact, some mutations might repair DNA or suppress tumor formation. So, this seems too broad and not necessarily always true.\n\nLastly, option D says that mutations occur spontaneously at a low rate. This sounds familiar. I remember learning that even under normal conditions, without any external influences, mutations can occur during DNA replication or due to natural chemical processes in the cell. And these spontaneous mutations happen at a low rate. So, this seems accurate.\n\nLet me double-check. Spontaneous mutations are indeed a natural occurrence, and their rate is generally low. This is because DNA replication mechanisms and repair systems in cells are pretty efficient at minimizing errors. However, sometimes mistakes slip through, leading to mutations.\n\nSo, comparing all the options:\n\nA. Mutations are not always harmful.\n\nB. Mutations can occur spontaneously, not only in the presence of carcinogens.\n\nC. Not all mutations increase tumor growth; some might prevent it.\n\nD. Mutations do occur spontaneously at a low rate.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is D: occur spontaneously at a low rate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
