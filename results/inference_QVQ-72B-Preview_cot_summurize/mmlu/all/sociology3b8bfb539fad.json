According to Marxist feminists, patriarchy is not just about unequal rights and opportunities between men and women, but it is deeply intertwined with economic systems, particularly capitalism.\n\nOption A suggests that patriarchy is about a lack of equal rights and opportunities for men and women. While this is certainly a part of patriarchy, Marxist feminists would argue that this is a symptom of a deeper structural issue rather than the root cause.\n\nOption B mentions \"sex classes\" through which men oppress women economically, politically, and sexually. This comes close to the Marxist feminist perspective, as they view gender relations as part of class relations, where men as a class oppress women as a class.\n\nOption C points out that women's domestic labor is exploited by the capitalist economy. This is a key aspect of Marxist feminist thought, as they emphasize the role of women's unpaid labor in the home as a foundation for capitalist accumulation.\n\nOption D refers to the \"dual systems\" of capitalism and male domination. This aligns closely with Marxist feminist theory, which posits that capitalism and patriarchy are interconnected systems that reinforce each other in oppressing women.\n\nGiven these options, the most accurate explanation of how Marxist feminists explain patriarchy would be Option D: the dual systems of capitalism and male domination. This encapsulates the core idea that patriarchy cannot be understood solely through the lens of gender relations but must be analyzed in conjunction with economic systems, particularly capitalism.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Marxist feminism is a diverse field, and different theorists may emphasize different aspects. For example, some might prioritize the exploitation of women's labor (Option C), while others might focus more on the class-based oppression of women (Option B). Nonetheless, the dual systems approach in Option D provides a comprehensive framework that integrates both the economic and the gendered dimensions of oppression.\n\nMoreover, Marxist feminists argue that capitalism relies on the unpaid or underpaid labor of women in the domestic sphere, which reinforces women's subordinate position in society and perpetuates patriarchy. This connection between capitalism and patriarchy is what leads to the dual systems of oppression.\n\nIn summary, Marxist feminists explain patriarchy in terms of the dual systems of capitalism and male domination, highlighting how these systems intersect to oppress women economically, politically, and socially.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
