                    "text": "So I have this question about the nitrate ion, NO3-. It asks how many sigma and how many pi bonds each resonance form has. The options are:\n\nA. 1 sigma and 2 pi\n\nB. 2 sigma and 1 pi\n\nC. 1 sigma and 1 pi\n\nD. 3 sigma and 1 pi\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the nitrate ion looks like. NO3- is a polyatomic ion consisting of one nitrogen atom bonded to three oxygen atoms, with a negative charge. It has resonance structures because there are multiple ways to arrange the pi bonds among the atoms.\n\nLet me draw one of its resonance structures to understand the bonding better.\n\nNitrogen is central, bonded to three oxygens. In one resonance form, one of the N-O bonds is a double bond (one sigma and one pi bond), and the other two are single bonds (each one sigma bond). So, in this form, there is one pi bond and three sigma bonds.\n\nBut wait, I remember that in the resonance hybrid, the bonds are delocalized, meaning the double bond character is spread out over all three N-O bonds. So, in the resonance hybrid, each N-O bond is a combination of sigma and pi bonds, but how do I count them?\n\nActually, in each resonance form, there is one pi bond, and the rest are sigma bonds. But since there are three equivalent resonance forms, the actual structure is an average of these forms, with each N-O bond having partial double bond character.\n\nBut the question is asking about each resonance form, not the resonance hybrid. So, in each individual resonance form, there is one pi bond and three sigma bonds.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, none of them exactly match this. Option C says 1 sigma and 1 pi, which seems close, but I think I need to consider the total number of sigma and pi bonds in the molecule, not per bond.\n\nLet me think differently. In NO3-, the nitrogen atom is sp2 hybridized because it forms three sigma bonds with the three oxygen atoms. Each oxygen is sp2 hybridized as well, forming one sigma bond with nitrogen and having two lone pairs.\n\nIn one resonance form, one of the N-O bonds is a double bond, which consists of one sigma bond and one pi bond. The other two N-O bonds are single bonds, each consisting of one sigma bond. So, in total, for one resonance form:\n\n- Sigma bonds: 2 (from the two single bonds) + 1 (from the double bond) = 3 sigma bonds\n\n- Pi bonds: 1 (from the double bond)\n\nBut wait, actually, in a double bond, there is one sigma and one pi bond. So, in the double bond, the pi bond is formed by the overlap of p orbitals perpendicular to the sigma bond.\n\nBut the question specifies \"each resonance form.\" So, in each individual resonance form, there is one pi bond and three sigma bonds.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, none of them directly say 3 sigma and 1 pi; option D says 3 sigma and 1 pi, which seems to match.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nTotal sigma bonds in NO3-:\n\n- Nitrogen to each oxygen: one sigma bond per bond. So, three sigma bonds from N to O single bonds, plus one sigma bond from the double bond. Wait, no\u2014that's not right.\n\nActually, in any bond, whether single or double, the sigma bonds are counted based on the number of single bonds. In a double bond, there is one sigma and one pi bond.\n\nSo, in one resonance form:\n\n- Two N-O single bonds: 2 sigma bonds\n\n- One N=O double bond: 1 sigma bond + 1 pi bond\n\nTotal sigma bonds: 2 + 1 = 3\n\nTotal pi bonds: 1\n\nSo, each resonance form has 3 sigma bonds and 1 pi bond.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. 3 sigma and 1 pi.\n\nBut let's confirm if there's any trick here.\n\nIs there a possibility that in different resonance forms, the number of pi bonds changes? No, because in each resonance form, only one double bond exists, hence one pi bond.\n\nSo, the answer is D. 3 sigma and 1 pi.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
