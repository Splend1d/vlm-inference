                    "text": "So I've been subpoenaed to appear at a deposition to testify about a former client. During the deposition, the attorney for the opposing party is going to ask me to provide some confidential client information. I need to figure out what's the right thing to do in this situation. The options are:\n\nA. Refuse to provide the information without a court order.\n\nB. Assert the privilege unless the client has signed a waiver.\n\nC. Provide the information if I believe it's pertinent to the case.\n\nD. Provide the information since privilege is waived in this situation.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what my ethical obligations are regarding client confidentiality. As a lawyer, I have a duty to protect client confidences, right? That's a fundamental principle of the legal profession. So, generally, I can't just go around disclosing confidential information about my clients, especially not during a deposition.\n\nOption A says to refuse to provide the information without a court order. That sounds like it's relying on some kind of privilege, maybe attorney-client privilege or something similar. But I think there's more to it than just waiting for a court order. Maybe in some cases, a court order is required to override privilege, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nOption B suggests asserting the privilege unless the client has signed a waiver. This seems relevant because the attorney-client privilege is a legal concept that protects communications between a client and their attorney from being disclosed without the client's consent. So, if I have a former client, and they haven't waived that privilege, then I should assert it and not disclose the information.\n\nBut wait, it's a former client. Does that change anything? I think the attorney-client privilege generally survives the termination of the attorney-client relationship, so even if someone is a former client, the privilege still applies unless the client waives it.\n\nOption C says to provide the information if I believe it's pertinent to the case. Hmm, that feels a bit too subjective. Just because I think something is pertinent doesn't mean I should disclose confidential information. My personal judgment shouldn't override the client's right to privacy and confidentiality.\n\nOption D states to provide the information since privilege is waived in this situation. But who waived it? The client? The court? I need to know more about whether the privilege has been waived.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. In a deposition, attorneys can ask questions, but there are limits to what can be asked, especially regarding privileged information. If the opposing attorney is asking for confidential client information, I need to consider whether that information is protected by attorney-client privilege or other privileges.\n\nI recall that the attorney-client privilege protects communications made in confidence between a client and their attorney for the purpose of seeking or providing legal advice. So, if the information I'm being asked to provide falls within that definition, then I should assert the privilege unless the client has waived it.\n\nBut what if the client is not present at the deposition? Or what if the client hasn't explicitly waived the privilege? I think I still have an obligation to assert the privilege and not disclose the information unless I have clear instructions from the client to do otherwise.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there are exceptions where the privilege is waived automatically in certain circumstances. For example, if the client is bringing a claim against me for malpractice, then the privilege might be waived with respect to that claim. But in this scenario, I don't have any information suggesting that's the case.\n\nAlso, I should consider whether there's a court order compelling me to disclose the information. If a court has ordered me to produce the information, then that would override the privilege. But in this scenario, it's just the opposing attorney asking during a deposition; there's no mention of a court order.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the information is relevant to the case. Even if it's relevant, privileged information generally can't be compelled without a court order that overrides the privilege. So, just because it's relevant doesn't mean I have to disclose it.\n\nI should also think about the potential consequences of asserting the privilege. Maybe the opposing attorney will object and try to get a court order to make me disclose the information. If that happens, I might need to go to court to argue why the information should remain privileged.\n\nAlternatively, if I disclose the information without the client's consent, I could be violating my ethical obligations and potentially facing disciplinary action. That's a serious risk I don't want to take lightly.\n\nLet me consider the rules of professional conduct regarding client confidentiality. I believe Rule 1.6 of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct states that a lawyer shall not reveal information relating to the representation of a client unless the client consents after consultation, except for certain exceptions like preventing reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm, or when required by law.\n\nBut in this scenario, none of those exceptions seem to apply. It's just a deposition where the opposing attorney is asking for confidential client information about a former client.\n\nWait, former client. Does that make a difference? I think the duty to preserve client confidences continues even after the client relationship has terminated. So, even if someone is a former client, I still have to protect their confidential information.\n\nMaybe I need to look into whether there's any exception for testifying about former clients in depositions. I don't think so. In fact, I believe there are specific rules about not testifying against a client in certain situations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a work-around where I can provide the information without violating privilege, but I doubt it. The attorney-client privilege is pretty straightforward in protecting those communications.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose I do assert the privilege and refuse to answer the question. What happens then? The opposing attorney might move to compel my testimony, and then I would have to go to court to argue that the information is privileged and should not be disclosed.\n\nIf I were in that situation, I would probably want to have the client's consent or a court order before disclosing any confidential information. Without that, I feel like I'm putting myself in a risky position ethically and legally.\n\nOn the other hand, if I do disclose the information and the client finds out, they could be upset and possibly take legal action against me for breaching confidentiality. That's not a position I want to be in.\n\nOption C suggests providing the information if I believe it's pertinent to the case. But again, that seems too subjective. My belief about pertinence shouldn't override the client's right to privacy. Plus, it's not my role to decide what's pertinent to the case; that's for the court to decide.\n\nOption D says to provide the information since privilege is waived in this situation. But I don't have any information to suggest that the privilege has been waived. Maybe the client has waived the privilege intentionally, but without their explicit instruction, I can't assume that.\n\nPerhaps I should consider consulting with another attorney or my firm's ethics counsel to get advice on this situation. That might be the best course of action to ensure I'm handling it correctly.\n\nIn summary, based on what I know now, I think the best answer is Option B: assert the privilege unless the client has signed a waiver. That seems to align with my ethical obligations to protect client confidences unless the client has explicitly waived that protection.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
