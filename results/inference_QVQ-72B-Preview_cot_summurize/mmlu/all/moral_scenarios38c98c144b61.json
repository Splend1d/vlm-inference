                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about two different scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let me break it down.\n\nFirst, there are two scenarios:\n\n1. I borrowed a book and took photos of some pages to remember them.\n\n2. I copied answers from a book during a closed book test at school.\n\nAnd I need to evaluate each scenario separately and then combine my judgments based on the options provided.\n\nLet me start by understanding what constitutes a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Generally, morality in the US is based on principles like honesty, integrity, respect for others' property and rights, and fairness.\n\nScenario 1: Borrowing a book and taking photos of some pages to remember them.\n\nOkay, so someone borrows a book, probably from a library or a friend, and instead of just reading it and returning it, they take photos of some pages to remember them. Now, I need to think about whether this action is morally wrong.\n\nFirst off, borrowing a book is usually a perfectly acceptable thing to do, provided you return it in good condition and on time. Taking photos of some pages might be seen as a way to retain information, maybe because those pages have important quotes or images that the person wants to keep.\n\nBut is this morally wrong? Well, it depends on a few things. If the book is from a library, there might be rules against photocopying or taking photos of the pages. Similarly, if it's a friend's book, they might not mind, but it's still courtesy to ask permission.\n\nHowever, from a moral standpoint, the primary concern here is probably related to copyright infringement. If you're taking photos of pages to share them with others or use them in a way that violates the author's copyright, that could be considered wrong.\n\nBut in this scenario, it says the person is taking photos to remember them, presumably for personal use. If it's for personal use only, and not for distributing the content or profiting from it, then it might not be seen as morally wrong.\n\nStill, copyright laws are in place to protect the intellectual property of the author, and without permission, taking photos of pages could be seen as a violation, especially if the person shares those photos or uses them in a way that undercuts the author's rights.\n\nHowever, in the context of ordinary moral standards, especially if the photos are strictly for personal use and not harming anyone, it might not be considered severely morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: Copying answers from a book during a closed book test at school.\n\nThis seems more straightforward. Copying answers from a book during a closed book test is typically considered cheating. Closed book tests are designed to test your knowledge and understanding without external aids.\n\nCheating in this context violates academic integrity, which is a fundamental principle in educational institutions. It's about being honest and demonstrating that you've learned the material on your own.\n\nIn the US, academic dishonesty, including cheating on tests, is generally considered morally wrong because it gives an unfair advantage over other students and undermines the value of education.\n\nSo, in this scenario, copying answers during a closed book test is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards.\n\nNow, going back to the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven that in Scenario 1, taking photos of book pages for personal use might not be clearly morally wrong, and in Scenario 2, copying answers during a closed book test is clearly morally wrong, the correct choice should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\" Maybe there's more to it.\n\nLet me double-check. In Scenario 1, while copyright infringement could be an issue, if the photos are strictly for personal use and not harming anyone, it might not be seen as morally wrong. However, some might argue that it's still unethical to bypass purchasing the book or properly citing the source if needed.\n\nBut considering the context is remembering pages for personal use, it's likely that many would consider it not morally wrong, especially since no harm is intended.\n\nIn contrast, cheating on a test is almost universally considered morally wrong in academic settings.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
