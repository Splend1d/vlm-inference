Seated meditation\n\nD. Funeral rituals\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that Zen is a school of Buddhism that emphasizes meditation and direct experience in enlightenment. It originated in China but became very popular in Japan, where it's known as Zen Buddhism.\n\nNow, zazen sounds familiar. I think it's a practice in Zen Buddhism, but I'm not entirely sure what it involves. Let's break it down.\n\n\"Zazen\" is a Japanese term. \"Za\" means \"to sit,\" and \"zen\" refers to Zen Buddhism. So literally, zazen means \"sitting Zen.\" That suggests that it's a form of meditation that involves sitting.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. A collection of statues \u2013 This doesn't seem right. Zen Buddhism is known for its emphasis on simplicity and minimalism. While there might be statues in temples, Zen doesn't revolve around collecting statues.\n\nB. Veneration of ancestors \u2013 This is a practice in some cultures, but I don't recall it being a central practice in Zen Buddhism. Zen focuses more on personal enlightenment and meditation.\n\nC. Seated meditation \u2013 This seems plausible. Given that zazen means \"sitting Zen,\" it likely refers to the practice of sitting in meditation.\n\nD. Funeral rituals \u2013 Zen Buddhism does have rituals associated with funerals and death, but again, these aren't the primary focus of the practice. Zazen seems more related to daily practice rather than ceremonial practices.\n\nLet me do a quick search to confirm my understanding.\n\nUpon looking it up, I find that zazen is indeed a central practice in Zen Buddhism, involving sitting in meditation. It's considered a way to directly experience the nature of one's own mind and reality.\n\nI also find that zazen is not just about relaxation; it's a disciplined practice aimed at fostering clarity, concentration, and insight. Practitioners often sit in a specific posture, usually on a cushion on the floor, with their legs crossed and hands placed in a particular position.\n\nMoreover, zazen is often practiced in silence, with a focus on breathing and being present in the moment. It's seen as a means to cultivate mindfulness and to realize the true nature of existence.\n\nGiven this information, option C. Seated meditation seems to be the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let's quickly look at the other options again:\n\nA. A collection of statues \u2013 No, Zen isn't known for collecting statues; it's more about minimalism and simplicity.\n\nB. Veneration of ancestors \u2013 While some Zen practitioners might honor their ancestors, it's not a core component of the practice.\n\nD. Funeral rituals \u2013 While Zen has its rituals for funerals, zazen is a daily practice, not specifically related to funerals.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is C. Seated meditation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Seated meditation}} \\]"
