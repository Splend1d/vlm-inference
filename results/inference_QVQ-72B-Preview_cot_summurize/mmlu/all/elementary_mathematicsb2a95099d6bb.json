                    "text": "I've got this problem here: when a certain number is divided by 4, the answer is 160 with a remainder of 2. I need to find out what that number is. The options are 38, 42, 638, and 642.\n\nOkay, so first I need to understand what it means when a number is divided by another number and there's a remainder involved. I remember that when you divide a number by another, the result is the quotient and a remainder if the division isn't exact.\n\nSo, in this case, the number divided by 4 gives a quotient of 160 and a remainder of 2. I need to find the original number based on this information.\n\nLet me recall the formula for division with remainder. It's:\n\nDividend = (Divisor \u00d7 Quotient) + Remainder\n\nHere, the dividend is the number we're trying to find, the divisor is 4, the quotient is 160, and the remainder is 2.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nNumber = (4 \u00d7 160) + 2\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n4 \u00d7 160 is 640, and then adding the remainder of 2 gives 642.\n\nSo, the number should be 642.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 38\n\nB. 42\n\nC. 638\n\nD. 642\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, if I take 642 and divide it by 4, what do I get?\n\n640 divided by 4 is 160, and 2 divided by 4 is 0.5, but since we're dealing with integer division, it should be 160 with a remainder of 2, which matches the problem.\n\nAlternatively, I can express it as 160 and a half, but in terms of quotient and remainder, it's 160 with a remainder of 2.\n\nSo, that checks out.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A: 38\n\nIf I divide 38 by 4, 4 goes into 38 nine times because 4 \u00d7 9 = 36, and 38 - 36 = 2, so quotient is 9 with a remainder of 2. That doesn't match our required quotient of 160.\n\nOption B: 42\n\nDividing 42 by 4: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, and 42 - 40 = 2, so quotient is 10 with a remainder of 2. Again, quotient is not 160.\n\nOption C: 638\n\nDividing 638 by 4: 4 \u00d7 159 = 636, and 638 - 636 = 2, so quotient is 159 with a remainder of 2, which doesn't match the required quotient of 160.\n\nOption D: 642\n\nAs calculated earlier, 4 \u00d7 160 = 640, and 642 - 640 = 2, so quotient is 160 with a remainder of 2, which matches the problem's conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is indeed option D, 642.\n\nI think that's solid. No mistakes here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{642} \\]"
