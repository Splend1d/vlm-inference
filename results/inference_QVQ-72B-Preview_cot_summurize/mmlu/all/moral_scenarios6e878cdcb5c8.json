                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I called into work because I didn't want to work.\" So, someone is supposed to go to work, but they don't feel like it, so they call in, probably saying they're sick or something, when they're actually just not in the mood to work. Hmm, that seems a bit shady. Like, they're pretending to be unwell or have some other reason not to come in, when really they just don't want to be there.\n\nIn most workplaces, calling in sick is acceptable when you're actually sick, but using it as an excuse to skip work when you're perfectly healthy might be considered dishonest. Honesty is a big deal in many moral codes, and lying to avoid work could be seen as cheating or taking advantage of the system.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are situations where someone might not want to go to work for a good reason, like they're feeling mentally unwell or they have personal issues to deal with. Some companies have policies that allow for mental health days or personal days off. If that's the case, maybe it's not as morally wrong as it first seems.\n\nHowever, assuming that the person just doesn't feel like working and there's no legitimate reason for not coming in, then yes, calling in under false pretenses could be considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: \"I called the cops on the man who hit no one.\" This one seems a bit more straightforward at first glance. Someone saw a man hitting someone, but it turns out he didn't actually hit anyone. So, the person called the police based on a misunderstanding or perhaps a misinterpretation of what happened.\n\nIf the person genuinely believed that someone was being harmed and called the police to intervene and help prevent violence, that seems like a well-intentioned action, even if they were mistaken. In that case, it might not be morally wrong; it's better to err on the side of caution and call for help when you think someone might be in danger.\n\nOn the other hand, if the person called the police knowing that the man hadn't hit anyone, perhaps to get the man in trouble or out of spite, that would be a different story. False accusations are serious and can cause a lot of harm to the accused person.\n\nBut the scenario says, \"I called the cops on the man who hit no one.\" It doesn't specify whether the person knew that no one was hit or not. It's ambiguous. So, I need to consider both possibilities.\n\nIf the person mistakenly thought someone was being hit and called the police, that's probably not morally wrong, as their intention was to help. However, if they knew that the man hadn't hit anyone but called the police anyway, possibly to cause trouble, that would be morally wrong.\n\nGiven that the scenario doesn't provide clarity on the person's knowledge or intentions, I have to make an assumption. Maybe I should consider the most likely interpretation.\n\nIn everyday situations, if someone says they called the cops on someone who hit no one, it's probably because they witnessed or thought they witnessed an assault and called for help. Unless there's reason to believe otherwise, I'd assume that the person acted in good faith based on what they perceived.\n\nSo, in that case, it wouldn't be morally wrong.\n\nComparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Calling into work because you don't want to work \u2013 this seems morally wrong if you're lying to avoid work.\n\n- Scenario 2: Calling the cops on the man who hit no one \u2013 this seems morally acceptable if done in good faith based on a mistaken belief.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" which corresponds to option B.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's more to consider.\n\nIn Scenario 1, is there any context that might change the moral judgment? For example, if the person had a lot of unpaid time off and was using it appropriately, or if they had a flexible work arrangement that allowed them to skip work without penalty, then maybe it's not as wrong.\n\nHowever, the scenario doesn't provide any such context, so I have to assume that calling in sick when you're not sick is dishonest and therefore morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, is there any way that calling the cops could be morally wrong even if the person acted in good faith? Well, if calling the police in a situation where no crime was committed could lead to harm or misuse of resources, that might be considered wrong. But generally, reporting what you believe to be a crime is seen as a responsible action, even if it turns out you were mistaken.\n\nMoreover, in the US, there's a cultural emphasis on reporting potential crimes to the authorities, especially if there's a risk of violence.\n\nTherefore, unless there's malice involved, calling the police in such a situation shouldn't be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, my final conclusion is that Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not, assuming good intentions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
