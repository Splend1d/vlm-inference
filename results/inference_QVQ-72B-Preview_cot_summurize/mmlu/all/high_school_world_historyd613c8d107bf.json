                    "text": "So I have this question here about South Africa's history, specifically about the event that symbolized the end of its institutionalized discrimination. The options are:\n\nA. The election of F. W. de Klerk\n\nB. The election of Nelson Mandela\n\nC. The bombing of Lesotho\n\nD. The Boer War\n\nFirst off, I need to make sure I understand what \"institutionalized discrimination\" means in this context. In South Africa, that refers to apartheid, the system of racial segregation and discrimination that was enforced by law from 1948 until the early 1990s.\n\nSo, the question is asking for the event that marked the end of apartheid.\n\nLet me recall some key events in South African history related to apartheid.\n\nOption A: The election of F. W. de Klerk. De Klerk was the President of South Africa from 1989 to 1994. He was instrumental in overseeing the transition from apartheid to a democratic system. He released Nelson Mandela from prison in 1990 and negotiated with him to end apartheid. So, his election in 1989 was a significant step towards ending apartheid, but it wasn't the end itself.\n\nOption B: The election of Nelson Mandela. Mandela was elected President of South Africa in 1994, becoming the first black head of state in the country's history. His election followed the first fully representative democratic elections in South Africa, which marked the formal end of apartheid. This seems like a strong candidate for the event that symbolized the end of institutionalized discrimination.\n\nOption C: The bombing of Lesotho. Lesotho is a neighboring country to South Africa. There have been instances of cross-border conflicts, including bombings, but I don't recall any specific event where the bombing of Lesotho symbolized the end of apartheid. This seems unlikely.\n\nOption D: The Boer War. The Boer War took place from 1899 to 1902 between the British Empire and the Dutch-speaking Boer republics. It preceded the establishment of apartheid by several decades. So, this was long before apartheid was implemented and couldn't possibly symbolize its end.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most plausible answer is Option B: The election of Nelson Mandela. His election in 1994 marked the culmination of a long struggle against apartheid and the beginning of a new era of democracy and equality in South Africa.\n\nJust to double-check, let me think about any other events that might be considered as marking the end of apartheid. For instance, the repeal of apartheid laws or the adoption of a new constitution. While these were important steps, the election of Nelson Mandela is widely recognized as the definitive moment when apartheid was officially ended and a new democratic order began.\n\nMoreover, the poem in the question refers to Sharpeville, which was a tragic event during the apartheid era, highlighting the brutality of the regime. The reference to Sharpeville sets the context for understanding the struggle against apartheid, making the election of Mandela, who was a leader in that struggle, all the more significant.\n\nTherefore, I am confident that the correct answer is B. The election of Nelson Mandela.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
