                    "text": "So I came across this question: \"What can murtis be translated as? A. Offerings B. Prayers C. Apparitions D. Idols\" And I need to choose the correct translation for \"murtis.\" Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about this, but let me think.\n\nFirst off, I recognize that \"murti\" is a term used in Hinduism, and it's often referred to in the context of statues or images used in worship. So, it's probably related to some form of representation or embodiment of a deity.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Offerings: In Hinduism, offerings are called \"puja\" or \"havan,\" which involve presenting flowers, lights, and other items to the deity. \"Murti\" doesn't sound like it directly translates to offerings.\n\nB. Prayers: Prayers in Hinduism can take many forms, including mantras, bhajans, and aartis. Again, \"murti\" seems more connected to visual representations rather than the act of prayer itself.\n\nC. Apparitions: This one is interesting. In religion, apparitions are manifestations or appearances of divine beings. While murtis can be considered manifestations of deities, apparitions are more about spontaneous appearances, whereas murtis are physical objects created for worship.\n\nD. Idols: This seems the closest. \"Idol\" is often used to describe a statue or image worshiped as a god. In Hinduism, murtis are indeed images or sculptures of deities that are venerated.\n\nBut wait, I've heard that the term \"idol\" can sometimes carry a negative connotation, especially in Abrahamic religions, where idolatry is looked down upon. However, in Hinduism, worshiping murtis is an accepted practice, and the term \"murti\" carries a positive significance.\n\nLet me do a quick search to confirm. Oh, looks like \"murti\" comes from the Sanskrit word \"m\u016brti,\" which means form or embodiment. It refers to the physical form of a deity, often a sculpture or image, that is used as a focus for worship.\n\nSo, in that case, \"idol\" might be the closest translation in English, but it's important to note that the connotation in Hinduism is different from how \"idol\" might be perceived in other cultural contexts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"icon\" would be a better translation, as it refers to an image or symbol of a sacred person or event, particularly in Eastern Orthodox Christianity. But \"icon\" isn't one of the options here.\n\nGiven the choices provided\u2014offerings, prayers, apparitions, and idols\u2014I think \"idols\" is the most accurate translation for \"murtis.\" However, to be precise, it's essential to understand that in Hinduism, murtis are revered as representations of deities and are central to worship practices.\n\nSo, my answer would be D. Idols.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
