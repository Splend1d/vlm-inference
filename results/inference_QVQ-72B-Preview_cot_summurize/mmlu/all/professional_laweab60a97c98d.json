When she arrived, the graduate was told that her job was contingent on passing the state bar examination, which was being offered in July. In preparing for the bar examination, the graduate planned to take a bar review course. Although she had not pre-enrolled, the graduate planned to attend and pay for the course at registration. On the morning the course was set to begin, the graduate arrived late after getting stuck in freeway traffic. By the time the graduate got to the course location, registration had already been completed. When the graduate looked into the room where the course was being conducted, she saw the lecture had begun, and everyone was inside busily taking notes. Panicky, the graduate picked up a set of course materials that were lying on the registration table and entered without paying. Although the graduate intended to pay the enrollment fee, no one was at the registration table to take her money. After attending the first couple of classes, the graduate sent a cashier's check for the full amount of the enrollment fee to the bar review company. Unbeknownst to the graduate, the bar review course's regional director noticed that she had entered the lectures without paying. After ascertaining her identity from a fellow student who knew the graduate, the company filed a complaint with the local prosecutor, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. The complaint charged the graduate with the crime of larceny by trick, for deliberately failing to pay for services rendered. After the complaint was issued, the graduate's check arrived at the company's office. The company deposited the check but failed to inform the prosecutor that payment had been received. The graduate was arrested and held in custody overnight before the matter was resolved. The graduate suffered severe emotional distress at the publicity she received in the local newspapers and the humiliation she suffered for being arrested and held in police custody. Terribly upset, the graduate was unable to take the bar exam and, thus, lost her job at the entertainment law firm. If the graduate asserts a claim against the bar-review company based on infliction of emotional distress, will she prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the graduate did not intend to defraud the company.\nB. Yes, because the company made no effort to inform the prosecutor that the registration fee had been paid in full.\nC. No, because the company did not intend to cause the graduate to suffer severe emotional distress.\nD. No, because filing-the complaint with the prosecutor was not outrageous conduct.\n"

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario here about a law school graduate who's trying to take a bar review course but runs into some trouble, and ends up getting arrested and facing some pretty serious consequences. Now, she's thinking about suing the bar-review company for infliction of emotional distress. The question is whether she'll prevail in that claim.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes infliction of emotional distress. Generally, to succeed in a claim for infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff has to show that the defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous, intentional or reckless, and caused severe emotional distress that was foreseeable.\n\nSo, let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nThe graduate arrives late to the bar review course because of traffic. When she gets there, registration is already over, but she sees the lecture has started, and everyone is inside taking notes. She picks up a set of course materials and goes in without paying, intending to pay later. She attends the first few classes and then sends a cashier's check for the full enrollment fee to the company.\n\nUnbeknownst to her, the regional director of the bar review course noticed she entered without paying. He finds out her identity from a fellow student and files a complaint with the local prosecutor, accusing her of larceny by trick for deliberately failing to pay for services rendered. A warrant is issued for her arrest.\n\nAfter the complaint is filed, her check arrives at the company's office, but they deposit it without telling the prosecutor that payment has been received. As a result, she's arrested, held overnight, and faces public humiliation and loses her job because she can't take the bar exam.\n\nNow, she wants to sue the company for infliction of emotional distress.\n\nOption A says yes, because she didn't intend to defraud the company. But I think that's missing the point. The issue isn't whether she intended to defraud; the issue is whether the company's actions in filing the complaint and failing to inform the prosecutor about the payment were extreme and outrageous, intentional or reckless, and caused her severe emotional distress.\n\nOption B says yes, because the company made no effort to inform the prosecutor that the registration fee had been paid in full. This seems relevant because if the company had informed the prosecutor that she had paid, the arrest warrant might not have been issued, and she wouldn't have been arrested or suffered the subsequent distress.\n\nOption C says no, because the company didn't intend to cause her severe emotional distress. That's an important point. The company likely intended to enforce payment or punish her for not paying initially, but did they intend to cause her severe emotional distress? Probably not directly, but their actions could be seen as reckless in that regard.\n\nOption D says no, because filing the complaint with the prosecutor wasn't outrageous conduct. But was it? Filing a complaint for larceny by trick when the person had intended to pay and did pay later might be seen as excessive or unfair, especially since they didn't update the prosecutor when payment was received.\n\nSo, to evaluate whether she'll prevail, I need to consider these elements:\n\n1. Was the company's conduct extreme and outrageous?\n\n2. Was the conduct intentional or reckless?\n\n3. Did it cause her severe emotional distress?\n\n4. Was the distress foreseeable?\n\nLet's consider each one.\n\n1. Extreme and outrageous conduct:\n\nThe company filed a criminal complaint against her for larceny by trick based on her not paying the registration fee, even though she had intended to pay and did pay later. They also failed to inform the prosecutor when they received her payment, which led to her arrest and the subsequent distress.\n\nIs this extreme and outrageous? It seems pretty severe, especially since they knew she had paid but didn't update the authorities. This could be considered reckless or even malicious behavior.\n\n2. Intentional or reckless conduct:\n\nThe company intentionally filed the complaint and recklessly failed to update the prosecutor when they received her payment. So, yes, their conduct was intentional and reckless.\n\n3. Severe emotional distress:\n\nShe suffered severe emotional distress due to the publicity and humiliation of being arrested and held in custody. She also lost her job because she couldn't take the bar exam. This seems like severe emotional distress.\n\n4. Foreseeability:\n\nWas it foreseeable that filing a complaint and not updating the prosecutor when payment was received could lead to her arrest and severe emotional distress? It seems reasonably foreseeable that such actions could lead to her being charged, arrested, and facing public humiliation.\n\nGiven these points, it seems that the graduate has a strong case for infliction of emotional distress against the bar-review company.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there are any defenses the company might have. For example, perhaps they didn't know she had paid when they filed the complaint, or maybe there was a mix-up in communication within the company.\n\nBut based on the scenario, it says that the company deposited her check but failed to inform the prosecutor. So, they had knowledge of her payment but didn't act on it. That omission could be seen as reckless or even intentional in causing her harm.\n\nTherefore, I think the graduate will prevail in her claim against the bar-review company based on infliction of emotional distress.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. Yes, because the company made no effort to inform the prosecutor that the registration fee had been paid in full.\n\nWait a minute, option B says \"yes,\" but the question is phrased as \"will she prevail?\" and the options are \"yes\" or \"no,\" with explanations. So, if I have to choose between A, B, C, and D, and I think B is the most accurate, then I should go with B.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nOption A: Yes, because she didn't intend to defraud. That's not really relevant to the infliction of emotional distress claim. Her intent to defraud might be relevant to the criminal charge, but not to her civil claim against the company.\n\nOption B: Yes, because the company didn't inform the prosecutor about the payment. This seems directly related to the harm she suffered, as it was their failure to update the prosecutor that led to her arrest.\n\nOption C: No, because the company didn't intend to cause severe emotional distress. While it's true they may not have intended to cause distress, their actions could still be reckless or extreme enough to be considered outrageous.\n\nOption D: No, because filing the complaint wasn't outrageous conduct. But as I thought earlier, given the circumstances, it might be considered outrageous, especially since they didn't correct the information when they received her payment.\n\nGiven this, I still think B is the best answer. The company's failure to inform the prosecutor about the payment is a key factor in her being arrested and suffering emotional distress.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Yes, because the company made no effort to inform the prosecutor that the registration fee had been paid in full.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
