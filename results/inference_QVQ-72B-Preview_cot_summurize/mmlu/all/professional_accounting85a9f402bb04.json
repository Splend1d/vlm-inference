                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these procedures an auditor would typically perform regarding subsequent events. I remember that subsequent events are things that happen after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued. Auditors need to make sure that these events are properly considered and reflected in the financial statements if they affect the numbers or disclosures.\n\nOption A says \"inspect inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end.\" Hmm, that sounds like it's related to cutoff testing for inventory. Cutoff testing is important to ensure that transactions are recorded in the correct period. So, if inventory was ordered before the year end but arrived after, the auditor might need to check whether the company has properly recorded it in the right period. But is this specifically about subsequent events? I think it's more of a general cutoff procedure rather than a subsequent event procedure.\n\nOption B is \"test internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate.\" This seems more related to the audit of internal controls and ensuring that any control deficiencies identified earlier have been addressed. While subsequent events might be relevant here if there are changes in controls after the balance sheet date, I don't think this is the primary procedure for subsequent events.\n\nOption C says \"review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.\" This sounds promising. Subsequent events often involve reviewing information that becomes available after the balance sheet date, like bank statements, to see if there's any information that affects the financial statements. Reviewing bank statements after the year end can help identify transactions that should be recorded in the prior period or that need to be disclosed as subsequent events.\n\nOption D is \"compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited.\" This seems like a procedure to check for consistency and to see if there are any significant changes between the periods. While this might be useful in some contexts, I'm not sure if it's directly related to subsequent events.\n\nLet me think again. Subsequent events are generally divided into two categories: recognized subsequent events and non-recognized subsequent events. Recognized subsequent events are those that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date, and they might require an adjustment to the financial statements. Non-recognized subsequent events are those that provide evidence about conditions that arose after the balance sheet date and might require disclosure.\n\nSo, in auditing subsequent events, the auditor would look for information that becomes available after the balance sheet date that could affect the financial statements. This could include things like material purchases or sales, changes in estimates, or events that might impact the going concern assumption.\n\nLooking back at the options, reviewing the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end (Option C) seems directly relevant to identifying subsequent events that could affect the financial statements. Bank statements can show transactions that occurred close to or after the balance sheet date, which might need to be adjusted or disclosed in the financial statements.\n\nOption A, inspecting inventory ordered before the year end but received after, is more about ensuring that inventory is properly accounted for in the correct period, which is a general auditing procedure for cutoff, not specifically a subsequent event procedure.\n\nOption B, testing internal controls that were previously inadequate, is more about the audit of internal controls and ensuring that control deficiencies have been remediated, which isn't directly related to subsequent events.\n\nOption D, comparing interim financial statements, might be useful for detecting errors or fraud by checking for inconsistencies, but it's not specifically aimed at identifying or evaluating subsequent events.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is Option C: review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end. This procedure is directly related to identifying and evaluating subsequent events that could impact the financial statements.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll recall the standard auditing procedures for subsequent events. Auditors are required to perform procedures to identify and evaluate subsequent events that may require adjustment of, or disclosure in, the financial statements. These procedures typically include:\n\n1. Inquiring of management about subsequent events.\n\n2. Reviewing minutes of board and audit committee meetings.\n\n3. Reviewing legal correspondence and contracts signed after the balance sheet date.\n\n4. Reviewing interim financial statements and management accounts.\n\n5. Reviewing the client's bank statements and other external communications.\n\nSo, yes, reviewing bank statements after the year end is indeed a standard procedure for subsequent events.\n\nI think I've got it right. Option C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
