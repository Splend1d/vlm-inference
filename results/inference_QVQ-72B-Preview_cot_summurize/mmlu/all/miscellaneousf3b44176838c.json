I know that in the United States, we have dollars and cents, and there are 100 cents in a dollar. I wonder if it's similar in the UK.\n\nLet me consider the options given:\n\nA. 10\n\nB. 100\n\nC. 500\n\nD. 1000\n\nHmm, 10 seems too few. That would mean ten pence make a pound, but that doesn't sound right. Maybe it's 100, like in the U.S. system. Yeah, that might make sense.\n\nWait, but I've heard of something called \"new pence\" and \"old pence.\" I think there was a change in the UK currency system in the past. Let me do a quick search to confirm.\n\nOkay, so I found out that in 1971, the UK decimalized its currency, meaning they switched to a decimal system where the pound was divided into 100 new pence. Before that, they had a different system with shillings and old pence.\n\nSo, now it's 100 pence in a pound, which matches option B. But just to be sure, let me check another source.\n\nYeah, according to this other source, there are indeed 100 pence in a pound. So, it seems like the answer is 100.\n\nBut wait, I recall that sometimes people might refer to different denominations, like twenty pence or fifty pence coins. But that doesn't change the fact that the base unit is 100 pence per pound.\n\nLet me see if there's any other information that might suggest otherwise. For example, maybe in some contexts, people use different conversions, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nSo, based on my research and common knowledge, I'm confident that the correct answer is 100 pence make a pound.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll look up a conversion chart for British currency.\n\nHere it is: 1 pound = 100 pence. Yep, that's straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 100.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
