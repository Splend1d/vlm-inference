                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about measurements of a block of wood. The true length is 1.010 cm, and three measurements were taken: 1.4 cm, 1.2 cm, and 0.9 cm. I need to figure out which statement is true about these measurements in terms of precision and accuracy.\n\nFirst, I should remember what precision and accuracy mean. Accuracy is about how close a measurement is to the true or accepted value. Precision is about how close multiple measurements are to each other. So, accuracy is about the closeness to the actual value, and precision is about the consistency of the measurements.\n\nLet me look at the measurements: 1.4 cm, 1.2 cm, and 0.9 cm. The true length is 1.010 cm.\n\nFirst, for accuracy: how close are these measurements to 1.010 cm?\n\n1.4 cm is quite far from 1.010 cm.\n\n1.2 cm is a bit closer, but still not very close.\n\n0.9 cm is also quite far.\n\nSo, none of the measurements are very close to the true value, which suggests that the measurements are not very accurate.\n\nNow, for precision: how close are the measurements to each other?\n\nThe measurements are 1.4 cm, 1.2 cm, and 0.9 cm. Let's see the differences between them.\n\n1.4 cm and 1.2 cm differ by 0.2 cm.\n\n1.2 cm and 0.9 cm differ by 0.3 cm.\n\nSo, the measurements are not very close to each other, meaning they are not very precise.\n\nTherefore, based on this, the measurements are neither precise nor accurate.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAccuracy is about the closeness to the true value, and precision is about the consistency among measurements.\n\nHere, none of the measurements are particularly close to 1.010 cm, so accuracy is low.\n\nAnd the measurements themselves are not consistent with each other, varying by 0.2 cm and 0.3 cm, so precision is also low.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be D. They are neither precise nor accurate.\n\nBut let's see if there's any trick here.\n\nMaybe I should consider the average of the measurements. The average would be (1.4 + 1.2 + 0.9)/3 = 1.5/3 = 0.5 cm.\n\nBut wait, the true value is 1.010 cm, so the average of the measurements is 0.5 cm, which is not close to 1.010 cm, reinforcing that the measurements are not accurate.\n\nAlso, since the individual measurements differ significantly from each other, they lack precision.\n\nSo, again, it points to D.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Maybe in some contexts, certain patterns or errors could lead to different conclusions, but in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nPerhaps I should think about systematic errors versus random errors.\n\nIf there was a systematic error, all measurements would be off in the same direction, which might affect accuracy but not precision.\n\nIf there were random errors, measurements would vary, affecting precision.\n\nIn this case, the measurements are varying and also not close to the true value, so both accuracy and precision are compromised.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. They are neither precise nor accurate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
