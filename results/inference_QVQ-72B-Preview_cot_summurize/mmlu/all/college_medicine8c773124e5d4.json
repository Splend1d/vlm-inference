                    "text": "So I've got this question about neurons, and I need to find out which statement is NOT true regarding their function. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: \"Hyperpolarization at the end of an action potential is one mechanism by which neurons limit the rate at which action potentials may fire.\" Hmm, I remember that hyperpolarization is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. This happens after an action potential during the refractory period. So, during hyperpolarization, the neuron is less likely to fire another action potential because it's more negative. That sounds like a mechanism to limit how often the neuron can fire. So, this seems true.\n\nNext is option B: \"The flow of sodium into the neuron depolarizes the membrane in the first phase of an action potential.\" Okay, during an action potential, sodium channels open, allowing sodium to flow into the cell. This influx of positive charge makes the inside of the neuron less negative, which is depolarization. This is a key part of the action potential process. So, this also seems true.\n\nOption C: \"The transmitting neuron secretes neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from its dendrites.\" Wait a minute, I thought neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminal, not from the dendrites. Let me double-check that. The axon is responsible for transmitting the action potential away from the cell body, and at the end of the axon, there are terminals that release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Dendrites, on the other hand, are typically responsible for receiving signals from other neurons. So, if the transmitting neuron is releasing neurotransmitters, it should be from its axon terminal, not its dendrites. Maybe this is the incorrect statement.\n\nLastly, option D: \"An action potential is initiated when the axon hillock reaches the threshold potential.\" I recall that the axon hillock is where the axon begins, and it's responsible for integrating the incoming signals and deciding whether to fire an action potential. When the sum of the incoming signals reaches a certain threshold, it triggers an action potential. So, this seems correct.\n\nGiven that, option C seems to be the incorrect statement because neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminal, not from the dendrites.\n\nJust to make sure, let's quickly recap:\n\n- Option A: Hyperpolarization limits firing rate \u2013 that's correct.\n\n- Option B: Sodium influx causes depolarization \u2013 correct.\n\n- Option C: Neurotransmitters are released from dendrites \u2013 no, they're released from axon terminals.\n\n- Option D: Action potential starts when axon hillock reaches threshold \u2013 correct.\n\nSo, the exception is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
