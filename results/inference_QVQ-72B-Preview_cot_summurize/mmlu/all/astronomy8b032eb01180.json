                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a comet of mass \\(m\\) impacting Earth, which has mass \\(M\\) and radius \\(R\\). The impact is at the minimum impact speed, and we need to find the expression for the total energy released in this impact.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"minimum impact speed\" means in this context. I think it refers to the speed at which the comet is just able to reach Earth's surface from infinity, accounting for Earth's gravitational pull.\n\nSo, the comet is coming from far away, where Earth's gravitational potential energy is zero, and it's approaching Earth with some speed. The total mechanical energy of the comet consists of its kinetic energy and its gravitational potential energy.\n\nThe kinetic energy \\(K\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\), where \\(v\\) is the impact speed.\n\nThe gravitational potential energy \\(U\\) is \\(-\\frac{GMm}{R}\\), where \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, \\(M\\) is Earth's mass, and \\(m\\) is the comet's mass.\n\nThe total mechanical energy \\(E\\) is the sum of \\(K\\) and \\(U\\):\n\n\\[E = K + U = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{R}\\]\n\nNow, I need to think about the energy conservation. If the comet is coming from infinity with zero initial speed, its total energy should be zero. But as it falls towards Earth, it gains kinetic energy due to gravity.\n\nHowever, in reality, the comet has some initial velocity at infinity, but perhaps in this problem, we're considering the scenario where it starts from rest at infinity.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"minimum impact speed,\" which might imply that it's the speed needed to just reach Earth's surface from infinity, considering Earth's gravity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the escape velocity from Earth's gravity, but in reverse\u2014like the speed at which the comet impacts after being pulled in by Earth's gravity from infinity.\n\nLet me consider the comet approaching Earth from infinity with zero initial velocity. As it falls towards Earth, its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.\n\nAt the surface of Earth (radius \\(R\\)), the potential energy is \\(-\\frac{GMm}{R}\\), and the kinetic energy is \\(\\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\).\n\nSince energy is conserved, the total energy at infinity (zero) equals the total energy at the surface:\n\n\\[0 = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{R}\\]\n\nSolving for \\(v\\), we get:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{GMm}{R}\\]\\[v^2 = \\frac{2GM}{R}\\]\\[v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}}\\]\n\nThis looks like the escape velocity formula, which makes sense because the escape velocity is the speed needed to go from Earth's surface to infinity with zero velocity at infinity.\n\nBut in this case, we're dealing with an incoming object from infinity to Earth's surface.\n\nSo, the impact speed is \\(v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}}\\).\n\nNow, the total energy released in the impact would be the kinetic energy of the comet at impact, which is:\n\n\\[K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m \\left( \\frac{2GM}{R} \\right) = m \\frac{GM}{R}\\]\n\nWait a minute, but looking at the options, none of them exactly match this expression. Let's see:\n\nOption C is \\(0.5 m \\left( \\frac{2GM}{R} \\right)\\), which simplifies to \\(m \\frac{GM}{R}\\), matching my calculation for kinetic energy.\n\nBut let's double-check if there are other forms of energy to consider.\n\nIs there any potential energy at the moment of impact? At the surface of Earth, the potential energy is \\(-\\frac{GMm}{R}\\), but since the comet is impacting, I think we can consider all its energy is converted to kinetic energy at the point of impact.\n\nTherefore, the total energy released should be the kinetic energy, which is \\(m \\frac{GM}{R}\\).\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, option C is \\(0.5 m \\left( \\frac{2GM}{R} \\right) = m \\frac{GM}{R}\\), which matches.\n\nBut let's see if there's any other energy to consider. For example, is there any change in thermal energy or other forms? Well, in reality, there would be friction and heat generated during the impact, but I think the problem is asking for the mechanical energy involved in the impact.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need to consider the binding energy of Earth, but that seems too complicated, and probably not relevant here.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other energy term I'm missing. What about the change in gravitational potential energy of Earth? But Earth is massive compared to the comet, so its center of mass doesn't move significantly.\n\nAlso, the comet might break apart or deform, releasing additional energy, but again, the problem likely wants the mechanical energy of the system.\n\nSo, sticking to basic mechanics, the total energy released is the kinetic energy at impact, which is \\(m \\frac{GM}{R}\\).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. m*v\n\nThis is mass times velocity, which is momentum, not energy.\n\nB. 0.5*m/(R^3)\n\nThis doesn't make much sense in this context.\n\nC. 0.5*m*(2GM/R)\n\nThis simplifies to \\(m \\frac{GM}{R}\\), matching my calculation.\n\nD. 0.6*G*(M^2)/R\n\nThis seems different from what I have.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be C.\n\nWait, but option C has a \"0.5\" in front, which seems off. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nI had:\n\n\\[K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m \\left( \\frac{2GM}{R} \\right) = m \\frac{GM}{R}\\]\n\nSo, it should be \\(m \\frac{GM}{R}\\), but option C is written as \\(0.5 m \\left( \\frac{2GM}{R} \\right)\\), which is the same thing.\n\nMaybe the way it's written in option C is a bit confusing, but mathematically, it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to this problem.\n\nLet me consider the comet's approach towards Earth. If it's coming in from infinity with zero velocity, and it's being accelerated by Earth's gravity, then its velocity upon impact is indeed the escape velocity, which is \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}}\\), as I calculated.\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energy is \\(\\frac{1}{2}m v^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m \\left( \\frac{2GM}{R} \\right) = m \\frac{GM}{R}\\), which corresponds to option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to consider the comet's orbit before impact. If it's coming in on a parabolic path from infinity, its velocity at impact would indeed be the escape velocity.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think option C is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other energy component that should be included.\n\nIf the comet was approaching from a finite distance with some initial velocity, there might be more to consider, but the problem states it's coming from infinity with zero velocity.\n\nTherefore, the total energy released in the impact is \\(m \\frac{GM}{R}\\), which is option C.\n\nI don't think it's option D, which seems to have an extra factor of \\(M\\), and options A and B don't make sense in this context.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C."
