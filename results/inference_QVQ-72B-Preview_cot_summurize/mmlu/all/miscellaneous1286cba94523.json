                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here: \"In what sport do you find 'steel cage' matches?\" And the options are boxing, fencing, pro wrestling, and college basketball. Hmm, interesting. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a \"steel cage\" match entails. From what I recall, a steel cage match is typically a type of combat sport event where the participants fight inside a large cage made of steel. This is usually done to prevent interference from outside or to contain the action within a specific area.\n\nLet me consider each sport one by one.\n\nStarting with boxing: Boxers fight in a ring that's usually square, with ropes around it. I don't recall any steel cages being used in professional boxing matches. Maybe sometimes in exhibition bouts or something, but it's not a common practice. So, perhaps this isn't the right choice.\n\nNext, fencing: Fencing is a sport that involves sword fighting, and the competition area is a strip with specific dimensions. There's no cage involved here; it's all about mobility and precision with the weapons. So, a steel cage doesn't seem to fit into this sport at all.\n\nThen there's pro wrestling: Now, pro wrestling is known for its dramatic and often over-the-top matches. I seem to remember hearing about something called a \"steel cage\" match in wrestling. In fact, I think it's a pretty famous type of match where the wrestlers compete inside a cage to prevent interference from outside or to add an extra element of danger and excitement. Yeah, this sounds promising.\n\nLastly, college basketball: Basketball is played on a court with a hoop, and while there might be barriers around the court in some arenas, I've never heard of a steel cage being used in basketball games. It just doesn't seem relevant to the sport.\n\nSo, based on this elimination process, it seems like pro wrestling is the sport where you'd find steel cage matches. Let me just double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nIn boxing, while sometimes there might be enclosed spaces for safety or other reasons, a steel cage isn't a standard part of the ring. Fencing definitely doesn't involve cages, as it's all about movement and technique with the swords. College basketball is played on open courts without any cages involved.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer should be pro wrestling.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there are any other sports that might use steel cages in their matches. For example, maybe some extreme sports or combat sports that aren't listed here. But since the options provided are boxing, fencing, pro wrestling, and college basketball, and I need to choose among these, pro wrestling seems to be the correct choice.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll think about the history of steel cage matches. I believe they first became popular in pro wrestling in the mid-20th century, particularly in promotions like World Championship Wrestling and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Matches like these were designed to add a sense of finality and intensity, often used to settle feuds between wrestlers.\n\nYeah, that lines up with what I know. So, I'm confident that pro wrestling is the sport where you find steel cage matches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. pro wrestling}} \\]"
