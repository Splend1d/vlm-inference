                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Boca Co. has a choice: either reimburse the state directly for actual unemployment claims or pay 3% of eligible gross wages. They've decided to reimburse the state because they believe actual unemployment claims will be 2% of eligible gross wages. Okay, so we need to calculate the accrued liability for unemployment claims based on this decision.\n\nFirst, let's understand what eligible gross wages mean. It's defined as the first $15,000 of gross wages paid to each employee. So, even if an employee earns more than $15,000, only the first $15,000 is considered for this calculation.\n\nBoca has four employees, each earning $20,000 during the year. So, for each employee, the eligible gross wages are $15,000.\n\nNow, they've chosen to reimburse the state at 2% of eligible gross wages. So, we need to calculate 2% of the total eligible gross wages for all employees.\n\nTotal eligible gross wages = 4 employees * $15,000 = $60,000\n\n2% of $60,000 = 0.02 * $60,000 = $1,200\n\nWait a minute, but let's make sure we're not missing something. The problem mentions that Boca could pay 3% of eligible gross wages or reimburse the state for actual unemployment claims, which they believe will be 2% of eligible gross wages.\n\nSince they've chosen to reimburse, they're expecting to pay less than the 3% rate. But the question is specifically asking for the accrued liability for unemployment claims in the year-end balance sheet.\n\nSo, according to their expectation, it should be 2% of eligible gross wages, which is $1,200. But let's double-check if there's any other factor to consider.\n\nIs there any possibility of additional unemployment claims beyond the 2% they expect? The problem states that they believe actual unemployment claims will be 2%, so presumably, they've estimated this based on historical data or other factors.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions that they could pay 3% of eligible gross wages or reimburse the state directly based on actual claims. Since they've chosen to reimburse, they're likely only responsible for the actual claims, which they estimate to be 2% of eligible gross wages.\n\nTherefore, the accrued liability should be $1,200.\n\nBut wait, let's see the options provided:\n\nA. $1,200\n\nB. $1,600\n\nC. $1,800\n\nD. $2,400\n\nOption A seems to be the correct calculation, but maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe the eligible gross wages are calculated differently.\n\nEach employee earns $20,000, but only the first $15,000 is eligible. So, for four employees, it's indeed $60,000.\n\n2% of $60,000 is $1,200. That seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding of what \"eligible gross wages\" entail. Maybe there's a different interpretation.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that the eligible gross wages are capped at $15,000 per employee, which we've accounted for. And since each employee earns at least $15,000, we don't have to worry about partial amounts.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the first $15,000 of gross wages paid to each employee.\" So, for each employee, it's $15,000, regardless of whether they earn more or less.\n\nIn this case, total eligible gross wages are $60,000, and 2% of that is $1,200.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The answer should be $1,200.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could influence the accrued liability.\n\nFor example, are there any state regulations or additional fees that might be applied? The problem states that under state law, Boca Co. may reimburse the state directly for actual unemployment claims or pay 3% of eligible gross wages. They've chosen to reimburse directly based on their estimate of actual claims being 2% of eligible gross wages.\n\nSo, unless there's something else specified, the liability should be 2% of $60,000, which is $1,200.\n\nTherefore, the correct amount to report as accrued liability for unemployment claims in the year-end balance sheet is $1,200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 1200} \\]"
