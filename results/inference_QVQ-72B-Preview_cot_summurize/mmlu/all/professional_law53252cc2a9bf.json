                    "text": "While undergoing a routine plastic surgery procedure, a patient died on the operating table. The patient's husband is suing the plastic surgeon alleging malpractice. Two years later, at trial, the defense called another doctor as an expert witness. The expert witness testified that the patient's death was a freak accident and that the surgeon's performance met the highest standards for medical care. On cross-examination, the plaintiff's attorney brings out the fact that, one week before trial, the expert witness and the surgeon signed an agreement to become partners in an outpatient plastic surgery clinic. The plaintiff's attorney suggests that the expert's testimony was awfully convenient and likely motivated by his desire to maintain a good relationship with the defendant. The defendant then calls another surgeon at the hospital as a witness. He is asked to tell the jury about a conversation he had with the expert inunediately following the patient's death. The witness stated that \"the expert told me the patient's death was a textbook example of a freak accident and there was nothing anyone could have done to prevent it. \"On objection to this testimony, defendant's attorney seeks a ruling on the admissibility of this question and answer.

                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario. It's about a malpractice suit where a patient died during a routine plastic surgery, and now her husband is suing the surgeon. The defense has an expert witness who says the death was just a freak accident and that the surgeon did everything right. But then on cross-examination, the plaintiff's lawyer reveals that the expert and the defendant surgeon recently agreed to become partners in a clinic, which might make the expert's testimony seem biased.\n\nNow, the defense calls another surgeon who says that right after the patient died, the expert told him that it was a textbook freak accident and nothing could have been done to prevent it. The plaintiff objects to this testimony, and the defense wants to know if it's admissible.\n\nI need to decide whether the trial judge should sustain the objection or overrule it, based on the options given.\n\nOption A says sustain the objection because it's hearsay.\n\nOption B says overrule the objection because a witness's veracity can be rehabilitated by a prior consistent statement.\n\nOption C says sustain the objection because a prior consistent statement can't be used to rehabilitate a witness's testimony.\n\nOption D says overrule the objection because the expert's statement is a statement against interest.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what hearsay is. Hearsay is when someone testifies about something that wasn't directly perceived by them, but rather something someone else said. Generally, hearsay is not admissible because it's considered less reliable.\n\nIn this case, the witness is testifying about what the expert witness said immediately after the patient's death. So, the witness is repeating the expert's statement, which would be hearsay since it's not the witness's own knowledge but the expert's.\n\nBut there are exceptions to the hearsay rule. One of them is prior consistent statements.\n\nI recall that prior consistent statements are generally not admissible to rebut an implication that the witness is testifying falsely because of some motive that arose after the statement was made. Wait, actually, I think prior consistent statements can be admissible under certain circumstances to rehabilitate a witness's credibility if their testimony has been attacked.\n\nIn this scenario, the expert's credibility has been attacked by the plaintiff's attorney suggesting that the expert's testimony is biased due to the partnership agreement.\n\nSo, the defense is trying to rehabilitate the expert's credibility by introducing a prior consistent statement\u2014that the expert said right after the death that it was a freak accident.\n\nI think that under some circumstances, prior consistent statements can be admissible to rehabilitate a witness's credibility if their truthfulness has been attacked.\n\nBut I need to remember the rules for using prior consistent statements.\n\nFirst, the consistent statement must have been made before the alleged motive to lie arose.\n\nIn this case, the expert's statement was made immediately after the patient's death, which was two years before the trial and before the partnership agreement was signed.\n\nSo, at that time, the expert probably didn't have a motive to lie or bias towards the defendant, since they weren't partners yet.\n\nTherefore, this prior consistent statement was made before any alleged bias or motive to lie existed.\n\nSo, according to some rules, this kind of statement can be admissible to rehabilitate the witness's credibility.\n\nBut I think there's a debate about whether prior consistent statements are admissible for rehabilitation.\n\nLet me think about the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\nUnder Federal Rules of Evidence 801 and 802, hearsay is generally inadmissible.\n\nBut Rule 801(d)(1)(B) allows for the admission of prior consistent statements to rehabilitate a witness's credibility when the statement is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the witness of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive.\n\nIn this case, the plaintiff's attorney suggested that the expert's testimony is biased due to the partnership agreement, which implies that the expert has a motive to lie.\n\nSo, the defense is using the prior consistent statement to show that the expert had the same opinion before any alleged bias existed.\n\nTherefore, according to Rule 801(d)(1)(B), this statement should be admissible to rehabilitate the witness's credibility.\n\nWait, but I think there's some confusion about whether prior consistent statements are admissible for rehabilitation.\n\nI recall that some jurisdictions allow it, while others don't.\n\nBut in federal courts, under Rule 801(d)(1)(B), it's allowed under certain conditions.\n\nSo, in this scenario, since the statement was made before the alleged bias arose, it should be admissible to show that the expert's current testimony is consistent with what he said before he had a motive to lie.\n\nTherefore, the objection should be overruled, and the statement should be admitted.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Sustain the objection because it's hearsay.\n\nWell, it is hearsay, but as we've seen, there's an exception that allows it for rehabilitation purposes.\n\nB. Overrule the objection because a witness's veracity may be rehabilitated by a prior consistent statement.\n\nThis seems to align with what I just thought. The statement is being used to rehabilitate the witness's veracity.\n\nC. Sustain the objection because a prior consistent statement cannot be used to rehabilitate a witness's testimony.\n\nThis contradicts what I just concluded. According to Rule 801(d)(1)(B), it can be used for rehabilitation under certain conditions.\n\nD. Overrule the objection because the expert's statement is a statement against interest.\n\nHmm, a statement against interest is a hearsay exception where the declarant makes a statement that is against their own interest, and it's considered reliable because no one would say something against themselves unless it's true.\n\nBut in this case, is the expert's statement against their interest?\n\nThe expert said it was a freak accident, which supports the defendant. But does that go against the expert's interest?\n\nWell, maybe if the expert thought it was the surgeon's fault, admitting that could be against their interest, but they're saying it's not the surgeon's fault.\n\nIt's not clear if this is a statement against interest.\n\nSo, I don't think this is the right justification.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be B: overrule the objection because a witness's veracity may be rehabilitated by a prior consistent statement.\n\nBut I need to make sure.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nThe key points are:\n\n- The expert testified that it was a freak accident.\n\n- The plaintiff attacked the expert's credibility by revealing a recent partnership agreement.\n\n- The defense wants to introduce a prior consistent statement made by the expert immediately after the incident to show that his current testimony is consistent with his earlier belief, before any alleged bias existed.\n\nAccording to Rule 801(d)(1)(B), this should be admissible to rebut an implication that the witness's testimony is a recent fabrication or influenced by a motive that arose after the statement was made.\n\nTherefore, the objection should be overruled, and the statement should be admitted.\n\nSo, the correct choice is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
