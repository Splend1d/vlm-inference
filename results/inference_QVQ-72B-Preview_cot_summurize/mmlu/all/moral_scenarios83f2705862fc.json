                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about two different scenarios involving a sister, and I need to figure out which one, if any, is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I wanted to know how my sister really felt about me, so I asked her.\" So, basically, someone is curious about their sister's feelings towards them and decides to ask her directly. Now, asking someone how they feel about you seems pretty straightforward. It's like seeking honest communication, right? I don't see anything inherently wrong with that. In fact, it sounds like a healthy way to understand the relationship better.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are some nuances here. Is there a chance that asking could be intrusive or cause harm? Well, depending on the relationship, I suppose, but generally, asking for someone's feelings is considered acceptable. As long as it's done respectfully and without coercion, I think it's fine.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"When I saw my sister's name in the men's bathroom stall, I crossed it out.\" Okay, so someone sees their sister's name written in a public place, specifically in a men's bathroom stall, and they decide to erase it. Now, I need to think about whether this action is morally wrong.\n\nFirst off, writing someone's name in a public place without permission is generally considered vandalism or at least disrespectful behavior. So, if someone wrote my sister's name in a bathroom stall, that seems like an invasion of her privacy or just plain mischief. But here, the person is crossing it out, which could be seen as an act of protecting their sister's name or reputation.\n\nHowever, crossing out someone's name in a public place might also be considered vandalism, especially if it's on property that isn't yours. So, there's a bit of a gray area here. On one hand, the intent might be to remove something that shouldn't be there, but on the other hand, defacing public property isn't okay.\n\nI need to consider the context more carefully. If the name was written there without consent, then erasing it could be seen as correcting a wrong. But if the sister had consented to have her name written there for some reason, then erasing it would be inappropriate.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't provide information about whether the sister knew or consented to her name being written in the stall. So, I have to make some assumptions. Generally, writing someone's name in a public place without their knowledge or consent is not okay, and erasing it could be seen as a corrective action.\n\nHowever, from a strictly moral standpoint, vandalizing public property by crossing something out is still vandalism, even if the initial act was wrong. So, perhaps the better course of action would have been to report the writing to the appropriate authorities rather than taking matters into one's own hands.\n\nGiven that, I might lean towards considering this action morally wrong because it involves defacing public property, regardless of the initial wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about this differently. Suppose someone writes a graffiti on a wall, and another person paints over it to clean it up. Is that considered morally wrong? In that case, people often praise the act of cleaning up graffiti. So, perhaps crossing out a name in a bathroom stall could be seen similarly, as an act of cleaning up something that shouldn't be there.\n\nBut again, without knowing the full context, it's hard to judge. Maybe the name was written as part of some art project or something, but that seems unlikely in a bathroom stall.\n\nConsidering all this, I think that crossing out the name could be seen as morally wrong because it involves altering public property without permission, even if the initial act of writing the name was wrong.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Asking a sister how she feels about you is generally not considered morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Crossing out your sister's name in a men's bathroom stall is likely morally wrong due to the act of defacing public property.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
