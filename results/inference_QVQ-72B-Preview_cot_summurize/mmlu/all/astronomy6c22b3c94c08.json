                    "text": "Let's see here. I'm trying to figure out what happens to the North Star, Polaris, when you travel north from the United States into Canada. The options are: it gets brighter, dimmer, higher in the sky, or lower in the sky. Hmm.\n\nFirst off, I know that Polaris is located near the north celestial pole, which means it's almost directly above the Earth's rotational axis. That's why it's called the North Star; it points north.\n\nNow, when you're in the United States, depending on your latitude, Polaris is at a certain angle above the horizon. I think your latitude is roughly equal to the altitude of Polaris in the sky. So, if you're at 40 degrees north latitude, Polaris should be about 40 degrees above the horizon.\n\nAs you travel north into Canada, your latitude increases. So, if you go from, say, 40 degrees north in the U.S. to 45 degrees north in Canada, your latitude increases by 5 degrees. That should mean that Polaris appears higher in the sky by about that same amount.\n\nWait, but let's double-check that. If I'm standing at 40 degrees north and Polaris is 40 degrees above the horizon, and I move to 45 degrees north, Polaris should now be 45 degrees above the horizon. So yes, it's getting higher in the sky as I go north.\n\nBut what about its brightness? Does its brightness change depending on your location? I don't think so. Stars don't get brighter or dimmer just because you move north or south on Earth. Their brightness is pretty much constant from our perspective.\n\nSo, option A is brighter, and option B is dimmer. I think both of those are incorrect because Polaris' brightness shouldn't change based on your location on Earth.\n\nOption C is higher in the sky, and option D is lower in the sky. From my earlier reasoning, Polaris should appear higher in the sky as you travel north.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to think about this. Maybe thinking about the celestial sphere. The celestial sphere is like an imaginary dome around the Earth, and the stars are fixed on this dome.\n\nThe north celestial pole is the point directly above the Earth's north pole. Polaris is very close to this point, so it remains almost fixed in the sky as you observe from different latitudes on Earth.\n\nSo, if you're at the equator, which is 0 degrees latitude, Polaris would be at 0 degrees altitude, right at the horizon. As you move north, say to 30 degrees latitude, Polaris would be at 30 degrees altitude. Continue to 45 degrees latitude, and it would be at 45 degrees altitude, and so on.\n\nTherefore, as you travel north from the U.S. to Canada, which is generally towards higher latitudes, Polaris would appear higher in the sky.\n\nWait a minute, but what if you're traveling north but also east or west, changing longitude? Does that affect the position of Polaris in the sky? I don't think so, because longitude affects the time zone and the east-west position, but not the altitude of stars.\n\nSo, as long as you're traveling north, increasing your latitude, Polaris should appear higher in the sky.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the extreme cases. At the equator, Polaris is near the horizon. At the North Pole, Polaris is directly overhead, at 90 degrees altitude. So, moving from the U.S., which is around 30 to 50 degrees north, to Canada, which is mostly above 49 degrees north, up to about 60 degrees north in some places, Polaris should indeed appear higher in the sky.\n\nI don't think the brightness of Polaris changes based on your latitude. Its intrinsic brightness is constant, and atmospheric conditions might affect how bright it appears, but that's not consistent and depends on factors like air clarity and light pollution.\n\nSo, atmospheric conditions could make it seem brighter or dimmer, but that's not a consistent change based on latitude alone. Therefore, the correct answer should be that Polaris appears higher in the sky as you travel north from the U.S. to Canada.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C. Higher in the sky.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
