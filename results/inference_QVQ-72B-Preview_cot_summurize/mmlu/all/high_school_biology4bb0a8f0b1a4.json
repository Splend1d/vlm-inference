                    "text": "Let's see here. So, the patient started taking this drug called 3TC to treat HIV, and within a few weeks, all the HIV in their body is resistant to 3TC. I need to explain why that happened. There are four options, and I have to pick the best one.\n\nFirst, option A says that HIV can change its surface proteins and resist vaccines. Hmm, but in this case, we're talking about a drug, not a vaccine. So, while HIV can mutate its surface proteins to evade vaccines or the immune system, I don't think that directly applies to drug resistance. Maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nOption B says the patient must have become reinfected with 3TC-resistant viruses. Well, it's possible, but I think there might be a more straightforward explanation. Maybe the drug just wasn't working because the virus mutated during treatment.\n\nOption C says that HIV started making drug-resistant versions of reverse transcriptase in response to the drug. That sounds plausible. Reverse transcriptase is the enzyme that HIV uses to make DNA from its RNA genome, and 3TC is a reverse transcriptase inhibitor. So, if the virus mutates the enzyme in a way that makes it resistant to the drug, that could explain why the drug stopped working.\n\nBut wait, option D says that a few drug-resistant viruses were already present at the start of treatment, and natural selection increased their frequency. That also makes sense. Since HIV replicates very quickly and makes lots of copies with mutations, there might have been some viruses in the patient that were already resistant to 3TC before treatment even started. When the drug started working against the non-resistant viruses, the resistant ones had an advantage and multiplied more, becoming the dominant type.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. If the patient had been exposed to 3TC-resistant viruses from another source, like through transmission from someone else who had developed resistance, then option B could be possible. But, generally, it's uncommon to assume reinfection unless there's specific evidence for it.\n\nOption A seems less relevant because it's about surface proteins and vaccines, not about drug resistance mechanisms directly related to 3TC.\n\nOption C suggests that the virus started making drug-resistant reverse transcriptase in response to the drug. While it's true that the presence of the drug selects for resistant viruses, it's important to note that the mutations conferring resistance are usually present before the drug is administered due to the high mutation rate of HIV. The drug then selects for those pre-existing resistant variants.\n\nOption D seems to align more closely with what we know about how antiviral drugs work and how resistance develops. It's a classic example of Darwinian natural selection: there's variation in the population (some viruses are resistant, some are not), differential reproduction (the drug kills the non-resistant viruses more effectively), and heredity (the resistant viruses pass on their resistance to their offspring).\n\nGiven that, I think option D is the best explanation. It's a general principle in medicine that when you start treating a population of microorganisms with a drug, you're applying selective pressure that can lead to the emergence of drug-resistant strains, especially if they were already present in low numbers before treatment.\n\nSo, in summary, the most likely reason that the patient's HIV population consists entirely of 3TC-resistant viruses after a few weeks of treatment is that a few drug-resistant viruses were already present at the start of treatment, and natural selection increased their frequency.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
