                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to figure out which option would most likely cause a shift to the right in the demand curve for orange juice. So, first things first, I should probably recall what causes a demand curve to shift. I remember that a shift in demand (as opposed to a movement along the demand curve) is caused by factors other than the price of the good itself. So, things like income levels, prices of related goods, tastes and preferences, expectations of future prices, and population changes can all affect demand.\n\nOkay, so specifically for orange juice, let's think about each option:\n\nA. A bumper crop of oranges in Florida. Hmm, a bumper crop means there's a lot more oranges available, right? But does that affect demand? Wait, maybe not directly. If there are more oranges, that might lead to a decrease in the price of oranges, but that would be a movement along the supply curve, not a shift in demand. Unless, maybe, the bumper crop leads to people thinking orange juice is more abundant and thus might change their preferences. But I think the primary effect is on supply, not demand.\n\nB. A decrease in the price of Tang. Okay, Tang is another type of beverage, right? I think it's a powdered drink mix, maybe similar to orange juice in some ways. If the price of Tang decreases, would that affect the demand for orange juice? Well, if Tang is a substitute for orange juice, then making Tang cheaper might make people buy more Tang and less orange juice. So, in that case, the demand for orange juice would shift to the left, not the right. Wait, but the question is about a shift to the right. So, if Tang is a substitute and its price decreases, that should decrease the demand for orange juice, shifting the curve to the left. So, this doesn't seem like the right answer.\n\nC. Expectations of lower future prices for orange juice. Hmm, this is about expectations. If people expect that orange juice will be cheaper in the future, would they buy more now or wait until later? I think if people expect prices to be lower in the future, they might delay their purchases, waiting for the price to drop. So, that would decrease current demand, shifting the demand curve to the left. But the question is about a shift to the right, so this doesn't seem to fit either.\n\nD. Expectations of higher future income among juice drinkers. Okay, so this is about expectations of future income. If people expect to have higher income in the future, how would that affect their current demand for orange juice? Well, orange juice is generally considered a normal good, meaning that as income increases, demand for it increases. So, if people expect higher future income, they might increase their current consumption of orange juice, expecting that they'll be able to afford more of it in the future. That would shift the demand curve to the right.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? I think the relationship between future income expectations and current demand can be a bit tricky. Let me think about it differently. If people expect to have more money in the future, might they be willing to spend a bit more now, thinking that they can afford it? For a normal good like orange juice, that could lead to increased current demand. On the other hand, maybe they might save more now, expecting to spend more in the future. But I think the general tendency is that expectations of higher future income lead to increased current consumption.\n\nLet me see if I can find any specific economic principles that back this up. I recall something about the permanent income hypothesis, which suggests that people base their consumption decisions on their expected long-run income rather than their current income. So, if people expect higher future income, they might increase their current consumption, including buying more orange juice, shifting the demand curve to the right.\n\nAlright, that seems to make sense. Let me just double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nOption A: Bumper crop of oranges in Florida. As I thought earlier, this is more likely to affect the supply of orange juice, leading to a potential decrease in price, but not necessarily shifting the demand curve.\n\nOption B: Decrease in the price of Tang. If Tang is a substitute for orange juice, a decrease in its price would make Tang more attractive, likely decreasing the demand for orange juice, shifting the demand curve to the left.\n\nOption C: Expectations of lower future prices for orange juice. If people expect prices to be lower in the future, they might delay their purchases, leading to a decrease in current demand, shifting the curve to the left.\n\nOption D: Expectations of higher future income among juice drinkers. Based on the permanent income hypothesis, this should lead to an increase in current consumption, shifting the demand curve to the right.\n\nSo, among these options, D seems to be the one that would most likely cause a rightward shift in the demand curve for orange juice.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, is there any chance that higher expected future income could lead to decreased current demand for orange juice? For example, if people start saving more now in anticipation of future spending, might they buy less orange juice now? Possibly, but I think the primary effect is that they feel more financially secure and thus spend more now.\n\nAlso, if orange juice is considered an inferior good, higher income might lead to decreased demand, but generally, orange juice is considered a normal good.\n\nSo, all things considered, D seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
