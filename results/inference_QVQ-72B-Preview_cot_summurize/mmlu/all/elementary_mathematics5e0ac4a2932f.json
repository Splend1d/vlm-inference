                    "text": "Let's see. I need to estimate the quotient of 117.83 divided by 5.67 using compatible numbers. Compatible numbers are numbers that are easy to compute mentally, often because they are round numbers or because they divide nicely into each other.\n\nSo, first, I need to find numbers close to 117.83 and 5.67 that are easier to divide. Let me look at 117.83. What's a compatible number close to that? Maybe 120? That's a round number and seems easy to work with.\n\nNext, 5.67. What's a compatible number close to that? Maybe 6? Again, a round number and seems straightforward for division.\n\nSo, now I have 120 divided by 6. That should be straightforward. Let me calculate that.\n\n120 divided by 6 is 20.\n\nSo, the estimated quotient is about 20.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. about 10\n\nB. about 20\n\nC. about 30\n\nD. about 40\n\nIt seems like B. about 20 is the correct choice.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I should see if there's a better pair of compatible numbers that could give a closer estimate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it differently. Perhaps I can consider the division as it is and see if I can estimate it without changing the numbers.\n\n117.83 divided by 5.67. Let me see, what is 5.67 times what equals roughly 117.83.\n\nWell, 5.67 times 20 is 5.67 * 20. 5 times 20 is 100, and 0.67 times 20 is 13.4, so total is 113.4.\n\nBut 117.83 is a bit more than that, about 4.43 more than 113.4.\n\nSo, maybe it's a bit more than 20. But the options are in tens, so maybe 20 is still the closest estimate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another compatible pair. Let's try 120 divided by 6, which is 20, as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 118 divided by 6.\n\n118 divided by 6. Well, 6 times 19 is 114, and 6 times 20 is 120. So, 118 is between 114 and 120, so maybe around 19.something, but that's still closer to 20.\n\nOr maybe 120 divided by 6 is exactly 20, which is a good estimate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about 117.83 divided by 5.67 as approximately 118 divided by 6, which is 19.666..., which is about 20.\n\nSo, again, it points to 20.\n\nLooking at the other options, 10 seems too low because 5.67 times 10 is 56.7, which is much less than 117.83.\n\n30 times 5.67 would be 168.1, which is higher than 117.83.\n\n40 times 5.67 is even higher, about 226.8, which is way above 117.83.\n\nSo, based on this, 20 seems to be the most reasonable estimate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method, like cross-multiplying or using decimals, but I think using compatible numbers and estimating to the nearest ten is the way to go here.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B. about 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
