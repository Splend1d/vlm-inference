                    "text": "Alright, let's tackle these statements one by one. I need to determine whether each statement is true or false, and then match them to the given options.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: \"Any set of two vectors in R^2 is linearly independent.\"\n\nHmm, I remember that linear independence means that neither vector can be written as a scalar multiple of the other. In R^2, the dimension is 2, so the maximum number of linearly independent vectors you can have is 2. But is it always the case that any two vectors are linearly independent?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose I have two vectors in R^2: (1, 0) and (0, 1). These are clearly linearly independent because they point in completely different directions. Now, what if I choose (1, 0) and (2, 0)? Well, the second vector is just twice the first one, so they are linearly dependent. Therefore, not every set of two vectors in R^2 is linearly independent. There are cases where they can be dependent. So, Statement 1 is false.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2: \"If V = span(v1, ..., vk) and {v1, ..., vk} are linearly independent, then dim(V) = k.\"\n\nI recall that the dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in any basis for that space. A basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the space.\n\nSo, if {v1, ..., vk} are linearly independent and they span V, then they form a basis for V. Therefore, the dimension of V should indeed be k.\n\nWait a minute, is there any exception to this? What if some of the vectors are redundant or if there are more vectors than the dimension of the space?\n\nWell, the statement says that {v1, ..., vk} are linearly independent and they span V. So, in this case, since they are linearly independent and span the space, they must form a basis, and thus the dimension of V is k.\n\nI think Statement 2 is true.\n\nSo, based on my analysis, Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true. Looking at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be D. False, True.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nFor Statement 1, I gave an example where two vectors in R^2 are linearly dependent, so it's not always true that any set of two vectors is linearly independent.\n\nFor Statement 2, as long as the set is linearly independent and spans the space, it should be a basis, and its dimension equals the number of vectors in the basis.\n\nYes, I think my reasoning is sound.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
