Following up with those who did not respond to the survey the first time\n\nB. Asking questions in a neutral manner to avoid influencing the responses\n\nC. Using stratified random sampling rather than simple random sampling\n\nD. Selecting samples randomly\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to figure out which one of these isn't effective in reducing bias.\n\nFirst off, bias in a sample survey can come from various sources. There's selection bias, where certain groups are overrepresented or underrepresented. There's response bias, where the way questions are asked influences the answers. And there's nonresponse bias, where people who don't respond differ in significant ways from those who do.\n\nSo, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Following up with those who did not respond to the survey the first time.\n\nThis sounds like it's addressing nonresponse bias. If you follow up with people who didn't respond initially, you might get more responses from them, which could make your sample more representative. So, this seems like it would help reduce bias.\n\nOption B: Asking questions in a neutral manner to avoid influencing the responses.\n\nThis is about minimizing response bias. If the questions are neutral and don't lead the respondent in a particular direction, you're less likely to influence their answers. So, this should also help reduce bias.\n\nOption C: Using stratified random sampling rather than simple random sampling.\n\nStratified random sampling involves dividing the population into strata and then sampling randomly from each stratum. This can be more precise than simple random sampling because it ensures that specific subgroups are represented. However, if the stratification variables are not related to the variables being studied, it might not reduce bias as effectively. But generally, stratified random sampling is done to reduce variance, not necessarily bias.\n\nOption D: Selecting samples randomly.\n\nRandom sampling is a fundamental principle in statistics because it helps ensure that every individual has an equal chance of being selected, which can help reduce selection bias. So, this seems important for reducing bias.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the option that is least likely to reduce bias. So, I need to think about which one of these might not be as effective in reducing bias compared to the others.\n\nLet me think about this again. Options A, B, and D all directly address specific types of bias: nonresponse bias, response bias, and selection bias, respectively. Stratified random sampling (option C), while beneficial, is more about reducing variance within the sample rather than reducing bias.\n\nWait, but if stratification is done correctly, meaning that the strata are defined based on characteristics relevant to the study, it can help reduce bias by ensuring that all important subgroups are represented. However, if the stratification variables are not related to the variables of interest, it might not necessarily reduce bias.\n\nMaybe the key here is that stratified random sampling is primarily used to increase precision by reducing sampling error, but it might not directly address bias in the same way that reducing nonresponse or response bias does.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose I'm conducting a survey on income levels in a city. If I use stratified random sampling based on neighborhoods, assuming that neighborhoods have different income levels, this could help ensure that all income levels are represented in the sample, thereby reducing bias due to underrepresentation of certain income groups.\n\nOn the other hand, if I stratify based on something unrelated to income, like favorite color, it wouldn't help reduce bias related to income.\n\nSo, in general, stratified random sampling can help reduce bias if the stratification variables are related to the variables being studied, but if not, it might not reduce bias.\n\nComparatively, options A, B, and D are more directly aimed at reducing specific types of bias: nonresponse bias, response bias, and selection bias, respectively.\n\nTherefore, I think option C is the least likely to reduce bias because its primary benefit is in increasing precision rather than directly addressing bias, unless the stratification is specifically designed to address a source of bias.\n\nI think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
