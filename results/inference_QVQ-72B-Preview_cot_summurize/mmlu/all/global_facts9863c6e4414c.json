Hmm, fertility rates can vary a lot between different countries and regions, so I need to think about what the average might have been globally.\n\nFirst, I know that the fertility rate is measured by the number of children born per woman, on average, over her reproductive lifetime. This is often referred to as the total fertility rate (TFR). The replacement level fertility rate, which is needed to maintain a stable population without immigration, is around 2.1 children per woman in most countries.\n\nNow, I recall that globally, fertility rates have been declining over the past few decades. In 1950, the global fertility rate was around 4.7 children per woman. By 2010, it had dropped to about 2.5. So, given that trend, it makes sense that by 2015, it would be somewhere around 2.5 or slightly below.\n\nBut let me think more carefully. I should consider the data sources and see if I can recall any specific figures. The United Nations Population Division regularly updates the World Population Prospects, which provides estimates and projections of fertility rates. Similarly, the World Bank and other international organizations track these statistics.\n\nIf I try to recall the most recent data, I think the global fertility rate in 2015 was approximately 2.4 children per woman. That would be consistent with the downward trend from higher rates in previous decades.\n\nLet me also consider some regional variations to get a better sense. In 2015, developed regions like Europe, North America, and East Asia had fertility rates below the replacement level, often around 1.5 to 1.8 children per woman. In contrast, many developing regions, particularly in Africa, had much higher fertility rates, with some countries reporting averages above 5 children per woman.\n\nGiven that the majority of the world's population lives in developing countries, their higher fertility rates would pull the global average upwards. So, even with developed countries having lower fertility rates, the overall global average should still be above 2.\n\nConsidering all this, I would estimate that the global fertility rate in 2015 was around 2.5 children per woman. That seems like a reasonable midpoint between the higher rates in developing countries and the lower rates in developed ones.\n\nJust to double-check, I can try to recall if there were any significant changes between 2010 and 2015 that might have altered the global fertility rate substantially. While fertility rates continued to decline during that period, it was a gradual decrease, not a sharp drop. Therefore, moving from around 2.5 in 2010 to, say, 2.4 in 2015 seems plausible.\n\nGiven this analysis, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. 2.5 children per woman.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
