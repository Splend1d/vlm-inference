                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I needed money, so I brought my gun to the pawn shop.\"\n\nOkay, so the person needs money and decides to sell their gun at a pawn shop. Now, pawn shops are places where people can sell or pawn their valuable items for cash. Guns are commonly sold at pawn shops, especially in the US where gun ownership is more prevalent. So, bringing a gun to a pawn shop isn't inherently immoral, right? It's a legal transaction, and it's a way for people to get money when they need it by parting with their possessions.\n\nBut, I should consider if there's any moral issue here. Is selling a gun wrong? Well, it depends on the circumstances. If the gun is being sold to someone who might use it for harmful purposes, that could be morally problematic. However, in this scenario, it's just being brought to a pawn shop, which is a licensed business that should follow legal procedures for purchasing and selling firearms.\n\nAssuming that the pawn shop follows all the necessary background checks and legal requirements for purchasing firearms, then the act of selling a gun to a pawn shop seems morally neutral. The person is just exchanging their property for cash, which is a common and acceptable practice.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"I installed cameras inside store bathrooms to watch customers.\"\n\nHmm, this one sounds sketchy right from the start. Installing cameras in bathrooms is generally a big no-no because bathrooms are places where people expect privacy. People go there to use the restroom, change clothes, or attend to personal matters that they wouldn't want others to see.\n\nSo, installing cameras in these areas would be a violation of people's privacy. It's not only morally wrong but also illegal in almost all jurisdictions in the US. Peeping or recording people without their consent in places where they have a reasonable expectation of privacy is against the law.\n\nMoreover, using cameras to watch customers in bathrooms could be for inappropriate purposes, like sexual gratification or exploitation. It's a serious invasion of privacy and can cause significant distress and harm to the individuals recorded.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, installing cameras in store bathrooms to watch customers is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Bringing a gun to a pawn shop to sell it is not necessarily morally wrong, assuming it's done legally and responsibly.\n\n- Scenario 2: Installing cameras in store bathrooms to watch customers is clearly morally wrong due to the severe invasion of privacy and potential harm caused.\n\nThus, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me consider if there's any context that might change this conclusion.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if the person selling the gun knows that the pawn shop doesn't follow proper procedures or might sell the gun to someone who intends to use it criminally, that could introduce a moral dilemma. However, without that information, I have to assume that the transaction is being done legally and responsibly.\n\nIn Scenario 2, even if the cameras were installed for supposedly benign reasons, like ensuring safety or preventing vandalism, it still constitutes a serious breach of privacy. Any potential benefits wouldn't justify the invasion of privacy involved.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
