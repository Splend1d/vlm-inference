                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about radioactive decay. At noon, there's 50 grams of a radioactive isotope, and nine days later, there are 45 grams left. I need to find out how many days it will take for only 20 grams to remain, and round that to the nearest day. The options are 54, 59, 60, and 78 days.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand radioactive decay. I remember that radioactive substances decay over time, and the amount remaining can be modeled by an exponential decay equation. The general formula is:\n\n\\[N(t) = N_0 \\times e^{-kt}\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(N(t)\\) is the amount at time \\(t\\),\n\n- \\(N_0\\) is the initial amount,\n\n- \\(k\\) is the decay constant,\n\n- \\(t\\) is time in whatever unit is being used.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people use a half-life approach, but since I have specific amounts at specific times, I'll stick with this formula.\n\nSo, in this problem:\n\nAt \\(t = 0\\), \\(N(0) = 50\\) grams.\n\nAt \\(t = 9\\) days, \\(N(9) = 45\\) grams.\n\nAnd I need to find \\(t\\) when \\(N(t) = 20\\) grams.\n\nFirst, I need to find the decay constant \\(k\\).\n\nFrom the initial condition:\n\n\\[50 = 50 \\times e^{-k \\times 0}\\]\\[50 = 50 \\times 1\\]\\[50 = 50\\]\n\nThat's just checking the formula, which holds true.\n\nNow, using the information at 9 days:\n\n\\[45 = 50 \\times e^{-k \\times 9}\\]\n\nI can solve for \\(k\\).\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 50:\n\n\\[\\frac{45}{50} = e^{-9k}\\]\\[0.9 = e^{-9k}\\]\n\nNow, take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\\ln(0.9) = -9k\\]\\[k = \\frac{\\ln(0.9)}{-9}\\]\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, \\(\\ln(0.9)\\) is approximately -0.10536.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[k = \\frac{-0.10536}{-9} \\approx 0.011707 \\text{ per day}\\]\n\nNow that I have \\(k\\), I can use it to find \\(t\\) when \\(N(t) = 20\\) grams.\n\nSet up the equation:\n\n\\[20 = 50 \\times e^{-0.011707t}\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 50:\n\n\\[\\frac{20}{50} = e^{-0.011707t}\\]\\[0.4 = e^{-0.011707t}\\]\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[\\ln(0.4) = -0.011707t\\]\\[t = \\frac{\\ln(0.4)}{-0.011707}\\]\n\nCalculate \\(\\ln(0.4)\\), which is approximately -0.91629.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[t = \\frac{-0.91629}{-0.011707} \\approx 78.2 \\text{ days}\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest day, that's 78 days.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 54\n\nB. 59\n\nC. 60\n\nD. 78\n\n78 is one of the options, but I feel like I might have missed something.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, confirming the decay constant \\(k\\):\n\nFrom \\(45 = 50e^{-9k}\\):\n\n\\[0.9 = e^{-9k}\\]\\[\\ln(0.9) = -9k\\]\\[k = \\frac{\\ln(0.9)}{-9}\\]\n\nCalculating \\(\\ln(0.9)\\):\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.9) = -0.10536 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{0.10536}{9} \\approx 0.011707 \\text{ per day} \\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, solving for \\(t\\) when \\(N(t) = 20\\):\n\n\\[20 = 50e^{-0.011707t}\\]\\[0.4 = e^{-0.011707t}\\]\\[\\ln(0.4) = -0.011707t\\]\\[t = \\frac{\\ln(0.4)}{-0.011707}\\]\n\nCalculating \\(\\ln(0.4)\\):\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.4) = -0.91629 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{0.91629}{0.011707} \\approx 78.2 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest day, it's 78 days.\n\nBut, I notice that one of the options is 78, which matches my calculation, but the other options are 54, 59, and 60. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem that could lead to a different answer, but I can't see it right now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider using the half-life approach.\n\nFirst, find the half-life of the isotope.\n\nI know that the half-life \\(t_{1/2}\\) is related to the decay constant \\(k\\) by:\n\n\\[t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}\\]\n\nFrom earlier, \\(k \\approx 0.011707\\) per day.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[t_{1/2} = \\frac{0.69315}{0.011707} \\approx 59.2 \\text{ days}\\]\n\nSo, the half-life is approximately 59.2 days.\n\nNow, if I start with 50 grams, after one half-life, I'd have \\(50/2 = 25\\) grams, and after two half-lives, \\(25/2 = 12.5\\) grams.\n\nBut I need to reach 20 grams, which is between 25 and 12.5.\n\nSo, after one half-life (59.2 days), I have 25 grams.\n\nNow, I need to decay from 25 grams to 20 grams.\n\nUsing the same decay equation:\n\n\\[N(t) = N_0 \\times e^{-kt}\\]\n\nWhere \\(N_0 = 25\\) grams, \\(N(t) = 20\\) grams.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[20 = 25e^{-0.011707t}\\]\\[0.8 = e^{-0.011707t}\\]\\[\\ln(0.8) = -0.011707t\\]\\[t = \\frac{\\ln(0.8)}{-0.011707}\\]\n\nCalculating \\(\\ln(0.8)\\):\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.8) \\approx -0.22314 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{0.22314}{0.011707} \\approx 19 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nAdding this to the first half-life of 59.2 days, total time is approximately \\(59.2 + 19 = 78.2\\) days, which again rounds to 78 days.\n\nThis confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the time from the start to when there are 20 grams, using the initial 50 grams.\n\nBut I already did that and got 78 days.\n\nI think the answer is 78 days.\n\nBut let's see if there's a way to interpret the problem differently.\n\nMaybe using the formula for exponential decay in terms of half-life.\n\nThe general formula is:\n\n\\[N(t) = N_0 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\frac{t}{t_{1/2}}}\\]\n\nGiven \\(t_{1/2} \\approx 59.2\\) days, and \\(N(t) = 20\\), \\(N_0 = 50\\):\n\n\\[20 = 50 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\frac{t}{59.2}}\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 50:\n\n\\[0.4 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\frac{t}{59.2}}\\]\n\nTake natural logarithm:\n\n\\[\\ln(0.4) = \\frac{t}{59.2} \\times \\ln(0.5)\\]\\[t = 59.2 \\times \\frac{\\ln(0.4)}{\\ln(0.5)}\\]\n\nCalculate \\(\\ln(0.4) \\approx -0.91629\\) and \\(\\ln(0.5) \\approx -0.69315\\):\n\n\\[t = 59.2 \\times \\frac{-0.91629}{-0.69315} \\approx 59.2 \\times 1.3225 \\approx 78.2 \\text{ days}\\]\n\nAgain, 78 days.\n\nSo, it seems consistent across different methods.\n\nI think the answer is 78 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{78} \\]"
