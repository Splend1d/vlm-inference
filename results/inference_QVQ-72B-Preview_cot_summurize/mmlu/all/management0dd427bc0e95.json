Let's see, an objective is like a goal, right? But maybe there's more to it. Let me read each option carefully.\n\nOption A says, \"A defined specified outcome to be achieved in the long-term.\" Hmm, that sounds pretty straightforward. It's about having a clear idea of what you want to achieve way down the line. But is \"long-term\" always necessary for an objective? Maybe some objectives can be short-term too.\n\nOption B is \"A clear set of goals to be attained given a set number of resources.\" This seems to emphasize that objectives are tied to available resources. So, it's not just about what you want to achieve, but what you can achieve with what you have. That makes sense in a practical way.\n\nOption C says, \"A clearly defined and measurable outcome to be achieved over a specified timeframe.\" This one seems very specific. It mentions that the outcome should be measurable and there should be a specific timeframe for achieving it. That sounds a lot like SMART goals, which are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.\n\nOption D is \"A set standard of performance agreed by workers and managers.\" This one is a bit different. It seems to focus on standards of performance rather than on outcomes or goals. So, it's more about how well something is done, not necessarily what is achieved.\n\nNow, trying to decide which one is the best definition of an objective. From what I remember, an objective is generally a specific goal that is intended to be achieved. It's usually measurable and has a timeline. So, that sounds a lot like Option C.\n\nBut let's double-check. Option A talks about long-term, but maybe objectives can be short-term or medium-term as well. Option B brings in resources, which is important, but not sure if that's the primary characteristic of an objective. Option D is more about performance standards, which might be related to objectives but aren't the same thing.\n\nI think the best definition is Option C: \"A clearly defined and measurable outcome to be achieved over a specified timeframe.\" This captures the essence of what an objective is\u2014something specific that you can measure and aim to achieve by a certain time.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider if there's any context missing here. The question is simply \"What is a definition of an objective?\" without any specific context like a business setting or educational goals. So, I think Option C is the most general and accurate definition.\n\nI don't think it's Option A because objectives can be set for different timeframes, not just long-term. Option B is close but seems more focused on practical constraints, which might not be essential to the definition itself. And Option D is more about performance standards, which is different from objectives.\n\nSo, my final answer is Option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
