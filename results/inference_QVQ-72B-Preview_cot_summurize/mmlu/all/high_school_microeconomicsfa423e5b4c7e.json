A high degree of government involvement.\n\nB. Public ownership of resources.\n\nC. Private property.\n\nD. Central planners set wages and prices.\n\nHmm, let's see. I'm not super familiar with economic systems, but I think I have a basic understanding of the free market.\n\nFirst off, I know that in a free market system, the allocation of resources, what gets produced, and at what price, is determined by the forces of supply and demand. That is, by what people are willing to buy and sell, not by the government.\n\nSo, option A says a high degree of government involvement. That sounds more like a controlled economy, maybe like socialism or communism, where the government plays a big role in deciding how the economy runs. But in a free market, the government's role is minimized, right? So, probably not A.\n\nOption B is public ownership of resources. Again, that sounds like something you'd see in a collectivist economic system, where resources are owned collectively or by the state. In a free market, I think resources are mostly owned by private individuals or companies. So, maybe not B.\n\nOption C is private property. That seems familiar as a key element of a free market. Private property means that individuals or businesses can own and control their own resources, like land, capital, and even intellectual property. This seems important because it gives incentives for people to invest, innovate, and take care of their assets. Without private property rights, people might not have the same motivation to work hard and be entrepreneurial.\n\nOption D says central planners set wages and prices. That also sounds like something you'd find in a planned economy, where the government decides what things should cost and how much people should be paid. In a free market, wages and prices are supposed to be determined by market forces, meaning the interaction between buyers and sellers. So, probably not D.\n\nLet me double-check. If I recall correctly, a free market is characterized by minimal government intervention, protection of private property rights, and allowing market forces to set prices and wages. So, based on that, private property seems like a fundamental aspect.\n\nI think the answer is C. Private property.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
