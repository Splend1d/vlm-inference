                    "text": "Let's see. If there's a 70% chance that it will rain on a given day, I need to find out what the percent chance is that it will not rain on that same day. Hmm, I think this has something to do with probability, right?\n\nOkay, so in probability, when you have two opposite events, like raining or not raining, their probabilities should add up to 100%, right? Because either it rains or it doesn't, there's no other option. So, if the chance of rain is 70%, then the chance of not raining should be the rest, which is 100% minus 70%.\n\nLet me calculate that: 100% - 70% = 30%. So, it should be 30% chance that it will not rain.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe using probability formulas. I recall that for mutually exclusive events, the probability of one event not happening is 1 minus the probability of it happening. Yeah, that matches what I did earlier.\n\nJust to be sure, let's think about it again. The probability of rain is 70%, so probability of no rain is 1 - 0.7, which is 0.3, or 30%. That seems straightforward.\n\nLet me check if there could be any trick here. The question says \"on a given day,\" so I don't think there's any dependency on multiple days or anything like that. It's just one day, and we're given the probability of rain for that day.\n\nI should also look at the options provided:\n\nA. 0%\n\nB. 30%\n\nC. 50%\n\nD. 70%\n\nOkay, so 30% is option B. That seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let's make sure. If the probability of rain is 70%, which is higher than 50%, meaning it's more likely to rain than not, so the probability of not raining should be less than 50%, which is 30% in this case.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that if raining has a 70% chance, not raining has a 30% chance. So, yeah, I'm confident that 30% is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other factor that could influence this. Suppose there's a third event, like it could be cloudy without raining, but the question specifies \"it will rain,\" so I assume that not raining means no rain, regardless of other weather conditions.\n\nAlso, in probability terms, if rain and not rain are complementary events, their probabilities must sum to 1. So, P(rain) + P(not rain) = 1. Given P(rain) = 0.7, then P(not rain) = 0.3.\n\nYeah, that's solid. I don't think there's any other angle to consider here. It's a straightforward probability question.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 30%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
