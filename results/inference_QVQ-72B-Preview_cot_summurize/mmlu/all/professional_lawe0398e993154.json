                    "text": "Okay, so I'm trying to understand this double jeopardy thing in the context of this drug dealer's case. Let me start by making sure I know what double jeopardy is. I think it's when someone can't be tried twice for the same crime. Like, if you're acquitted, they can't prosecute you again for the same offense. But I think there are exceptions or complexities, especially when it comes to federal and state jurisdictions.\n\nSo, in this case, the drug dealer was arrested for selling cocaine to undercover cops and was convicted in state court for possession with intent to distribute narcotics. He got a 10-year sentence. Then, while his appeal is pending, he's indicted again by both a federal and a state grand jury for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine. His lawyer is saying that this violates double jeopardy and wants both new indictments dismissed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what double jeopardy actually protects against. I think it's primarily about not being prosecuted twice for the same offense after an acquittal or a conviction. But in this case, he's already been convicted in state court for possession with intent to distribute. Now, he's being indicted for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine by both federal and state grand juries.\n\nI wonder if the new charges are considered the same offense. Is conspiracy to distribute the same as possession with intent to distribute? I don't think so. Conspiracy involves an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, whereas possession with intent is more about having the drugs with the plan to sell them. So, they seem like different crimes.\n\nBut, maybe double jeopardy applies because it's the same cocaine and related to the same transaction. I'm a bit confused here.\n\nAlso, there's the issue of federal and state jurisdictions. I recall that under the dual sovereignty doctrine, a person can be prosecuted by both state and federal governments for the same crime without violating double jeopardy. So, even if he was convicted in state court, the federal government can still prosecute him for the same act.\n\nBut does that apply to conspiracy charges? And what if the conspiracy charge is based on the same act that led to the state conviction?\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose someone is convicted in state court for robbery and then the federal government indicts them for robbery under federal law. The dual sovereignty doctrine would allow that, right? So, in this case, it's similar but with conspiracy charges.\n\nWait, but conspiracy is a separate crime from possession with intent to distribute. So, even if the conspiracy involves the same cocaine, it's a different crime, isn't it?\n\nI think the key here is whether the new charges are for the same offense or a different one. Since conspiracy is a separate crime from possession with intent, maybe double jeopardy doesn't apply.\n\nBut I've heard about something called \"offense identity\" in double jeopardy cases. Maybe the courts look at whether the elements of the crimes are the same or substantially the same.\n\nLet me look that up. Oh, there's something called the \"same offense\" test, which involves whether the elements of the crimes are the same. If they're different, then it's not the same offense for double jeopardy purposes.\n\nIn this case, possession with intent to distribute and conspiracy to distribute have different elements. Possession with intent requires having the drugs and the intent to sell them, while conspiracy requires an agreement to commit the crime and some act in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\nSo, they're different crimes with different elements. Therefore, prosecuting for conspiracy after a conviction for possession with intent shouldn't violate double jeopardy.\n\nBut what about the fact that it's the same cocaine and probably the same underlying act?\n\nWell, I think that's where the dual sovereignty doctrine comes in. Even if the same act violates both state and federal law, each government can prosecute separately.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the state can convict him for possession with intent, and the federal government can prosecute him for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine.\n\nAdditionally, the state can also prosecute for conspiracy if they choose to, which they are, and that should be allowed under the dual sovereignty doctrine.\n\nTherefore, neither indictment should be dismissed on double jeopardy grounds.\n\nWait, but the answer options suggest that one or both indictments might be dismissed. My reasoning leads me to think that neither should be dismissed, so option D. Neither of the indictments.\n\nBut maybe there's something I'm missing. Perhaps there's a limit to how many times someone can be prosecuted for the same conduct, even under different jurisdictions or for different crimes.\n\nLet me consider the Supreme Court case Lawrence v. Texas, where they talked about due process and not being subjected to multiple prosecutions for the same act. But that was about decriminalizing certain behaviors.\n\nAlternatively, there's the concept of collateral estoppel, where if an issue was decided in a prior proceeding, it can't be litigated again. But I don't think that applies here.\n\nGiven that, I still think that both indictments should stand, and double jeopardy shouldn't require their dismissal.\n\nSo, my answer is D. Neither of the indictments.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
