                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out what the musician's chances are of winning a damage claim against his neighbor for causing his storage building to collapse. The neighbor started a sand business and did a lot of heavy hauling and excavating on his property, and as a result, the musician's storage building collapsed. Now, the question is asking which of these options is correct regarding the musician's ability to recover damages.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal concepts that might apply here. There's a mention of \"lateral support,\" which I think has to do with the natural support that land provides to adjacent land. So, if the neighbor is excavating heavily, maybe he's removing the natural support that was holding up the musician's land, leading to the collapse of the building.\n\nOption A says the musician will probably be successful if he can prove the neighbor was negligent in his excavations. Negligence means that the neighbor didn't act with reasonable care, and that his actions caused the damage. So, if the musician can show that the neighbor should have known that his excavating could cause damage to neighboring properties and he didn't take steps to prevent it, that could be negligence.\n\nOption B says the musician will be successful because the neighbor would be strictly liable for his removal of lateral support. Strict liability means that the neighbor would be responsible for the damage regardless of whether he was negligent or not, just because he was conducting an activity that could cause such damage.\n\nOption C says the musician will not be successful because the neighbor can't be held liable for damage to an artificial structure like a storage building. That seems odd because usually, property damage includes both natural and artificial structures.\n\nOption D says the musician will not be successful because an adjacent landowner is under no affirmative duty to laterally support his neighbor's land. This seems to contradict option B, which suggests that there is a duty to provide lateral support.\n\nOkay, so I need to sort this out. I recall that in property law, there's a principle called the \"rule of lateral and subjacent support.\" This rule basically says that landowners have the right to have their land supported by the land below and beside it. So, if a neighbor excavates and removes that support, causing damage to the adjacent land or structures, they may be liable.\n\nNow, is this a case where the neighbor has to provide lateral support? It seems like yes, because excavating can remove the natural support that holds up the neighboring land. So, if the neighbor excavates and doesn't provide adequate support, and as a result, the musician's building collapses, then the neighbor might be liable.\n\nBut, is this a case of negligence or strict liability? Negligence requires proving that the neighbor didn't act reasonably, while strict liability doesn't require proving negligence; the activity itself is so inherently dangerous that the neighbor is liable regardless of fault.\n\nI think in most jurisdictions, the removal of lateral support without providing adequate replacement support is considered a violation of the duty to support neighboring land, and the landowner who causes damage by such actions can be held liable, possibly under strict liability.\n\nHowever, option A suggests that negligence needs to be proven, while option B says strict liability applies. Given that excavating and removing lateral support can be considered an ultrahazardous activity, which often falls under strict liability in tort law, option B seems plausible.\n\nBut, I need to make sure. Let me think about this differently. If someone excavates their land and doesn't provide proper support, causing the neighboring land to subside or structures to collapse, is this something for which they would be strictly liable?\n\nI did a quick search in my mind about cases related to lateral support and strict liability. I recall that in some jurisdictions, the removal of support without providing adequate replacement can indeed be a basis for strict liability, especially if the activity is abnormally dangerous.\n\nOn the other hand, some places might require proof of negligence, meaning that the landowner who excavates must act reasonably to prevent harm to neighboring properties.\n\nGiven that, option A and option B are both possible, depending on the jurisdiction. But the question seems to be pointing towards one of them as the most accurate.\n\nOption C seems incorrect because it claims that the neighbor can't be held liable for damage to an artificial structure. That doesn't make sense because typically, property damage includes both natural features and man-made structures.\n\nOption D contradicts the idea of lateral support, saying that there's no affirmative duty to provide lateral support. That seems contrary to the rule of lateral and subjacent support.\n\nTherefore, between options A and B, I need to decide which one is more accurate. Considering that excavating and removing lateral support can be seen as an abnormally dangerous activity, which is often subject to strict liability, I'm leaning towards option B.\n\nSo, the musician will probably be successful because the neighbor would be strictly liable for his removal of lateral support.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
