                    "text": "So I've got this equation: 1.2 equals 0.4y. And I'm supposed to solve for y using mental math. Okay, let's see. I'm not super confident with mental math, but maybe I can break it down.\n\nFirst, the equation is 1.2 = 0.4y. I need to find out what y is. It looks like I need to divide both sides by 0.4 to isolate y. So, y equals 1.2 divided by 0.4.\n\nHmm, dividing decimals can be tricky, but maybe if I think about it in terms of fractions, it'll be easier. 1.2 is the same as 12 tenths, and 0.4 is 4 tenths. So, 12 tenths divided by 4 tenths is the same as 12 divided by 4, right? Wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me think about it differently. Maybe I can move the decimal points to make it easier. If I multiply both numbers by 10, then I get 12 equals 4y. Then, dividing both sides by 4, y equals 12 divided by 4, which is 3.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, y equals 3. Let me check if that makes sense. If y is 3, then 0.4 times 3 is 1.2, which matches the equation. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I should consider another approach. Maybe using algebraic steps.\n\nStarting with 1.2 = 0.4y, I can divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for y.\n\nSo, y = 1.2 / 0.4.\n\nNow, to divide 1.2 by 0.4, I can think of it as multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 10 to eliminate the decimals.\n\nSo, 1.2 divided by 0.4 is the same as (1.2 * 10) divided by (0.4 * 10), which is 12 divided by 4.\n\nAnd 12 divided by 4 is 3.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous answer. So, y equals 3.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA. 1.6\n\nB. \u22123\n\nC. 4\n\nD. 3\n\nSo, option D is 3, which is what I got.\n\nWait a minute, is there any possibility that y could be negative? Let's see. If y were negative, say y = -3, then 0.4 times -3 would be -1.2, which doesn't equal 1.2. So, y can't be negative.\n\nAlso, option C is 4. If y = 4, then 0.4 times 4 is 1.6, which doesn't equal 1.2. So, that's not correct.\n\nOption A is 1.6. If y = 1.6, then 0.4 times 1.6 is 0.64, which is not 1.2.\n\nSo, the only option that works is D, which is 3.\n\nI think I'm confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
