                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, there's a supermarket that just reopened after a six-month renovation. The painting company fixed up the ceilings and walls. The day after reopening, the manager notices some plaster fragments on the floor from a specific area of the ceiling, about 10 square feet. He puts up signs saying \"Caution: Falling Plaster\" and calls the painting company to fix it. Later that afternoon, a shopper is in that area, reaches for some canned goods, and at that moment, part of the ceiling falls and hits her, causing serious injuries.\n\nNow, the question is whether the shopper will prevail if she sues the supermarket. The options are:\n\nA. Prevail, because the supermarket failed to take adequate precaution to ensure the safety of its patrons against such an unreasonable risk of harm.\n\nB. Prevail, because the supermarket is vicariously liable for the negligence of its independent contractor in the performance of a non-delegable duty.\n\nC. Not prevail, because the injury was the fault of the painting company.\n\nD. Not prevail, because the supermarket posted signs warning customers of the risk of harm.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the supermarket had renovations done by a painting company, including fixing the ceilings and walls. After reopening, the manager notices plaster fragments falling from a specific area, about 10 square feet. He posts warning signs and contacts the painting company to fix it. Despite this, a section of the ceiling falls and injures a shopper who was in the warned area.\n\nSo, the supermarket took some steps to address the issue by warning customers and seeking repair, but the accident still occurred.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n**Option A:** Prevail, because the supermarket failed to take adequate precaution to ensure the safety of its patrons against such an unreasonable risk of harm.\n\n- The supermarket did post warning signs, but perhaps the question is whether those warnings were sufficient. Also, the supermarket called the painting company to fix the issue, showing they were taking steps to address the problem.\n\n- However, the fact that the ceiling fell despite these measures might indicate that the supermarket didn't do enough to prevent the harm. Maybe they should have closed off the area completely instead of just posting signs.\n\n- So, there's a possibility that the supermarket didn't take adequate precautions.\n\n**Option B:** Prevail, because the supermarket is vicariously liable for the negligence of its independent contractor in the performance of a non-delegable duty.\n\n- This one gets into the relationship between the supermarket and the painting company. The painting company was an independent contractor hired by the supermarket.\n\n- Generally, employers aren't liable for the actions of independent contractors unless certain exceptions apply, like retaining control over the work or if the work is inherently dangerous.\n\n- The term \"non-delegable duty\" suggests that even though the work was delegated to an independent contractor, the supermarket still has a responsibility to ensure the safety of its patrons.\n\n- So, if repairing ceilings is considered a non-delegable duty, meaning the supermarket can't shift the responsibility for safety to the contractor, then the supermarket could be liable.\n\n- But, I need to think about whether ceiling repairs are considered a non-delegable duty. I'm not entirely sure, so I might need to look that up or think of similar cases.\n\n**Option C:** Not prevail, because the injury was the fault of the painting company.\n\n- This option suggests that the\u8d23\u4efb lies solely with the painting company since they did the renovation and presumably didn't do it correctly, leading to the plaster falling.\n\n- However, just because the painting company is at fault doesn't mean the supermarket isn't liable. As a business open to the public, supermarkets have a duty to ensure the safety of their patrons.\n\n- So, even if the painting company is negligent, the supermarket might still be held responsible if they didn't exercise reasonable care in maintaining a safe environment.\n\n- Therefore, this option seems unlikely.\n\n**Option D:** Not prevail, because the supermarket posted signs warning customers of the risk of harm.\n\n- The supermarket did post warning signs, which shows they were aware of the potential danger and took steps to warn customers.\n\n- However, the shopper was still in the area and was injured. The question is whether the warnings were sufficient, and whether the supermarket had a duty to do more than just post signs.\n\n- Maybe the supermarket should have closed off the area entirely to prevent customers from entering and being injured.\n\n- So, while posting signs is a step, it might not be enough to fully discharge their duty of care to customers.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that the supermarket did take some steps to address the issue by warning customers and arranging for repairs, but perhaps those steps weren't sufficient to prevent the injury.\n\nBetween the options, I'm leaning towards Option A: Prevail, because the supermarket failed to take adequate precaution to ensure the safety of its patrons against such an unreasonable risk of harm.\n\nThe fact that they posted signs but didn't close off the area might indicate that they didn't take sufficient precautions to protect their customers from the risk of falling plaster.\n\nOption B is also plausible, but I think Option A is stronger because it directly relates to the supermarket's duty to maintain a safe environment for its patrons, regardless of who performed the repairs.\n\nOption C seems unlikely because even if the painting company is at fault, the supermarket still has a responsibility to ensure customer safety.\n\nOption D suggests that posting signs is sufficient, but as discussed, it might not be enough if the risk is significant and the supermarket should have taken more extensive measures to prevent injury.\n\nTherefore, I think the shopper will probably prevail based on the supermarket's failure to take adequate precautions to ensure customer safety.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
