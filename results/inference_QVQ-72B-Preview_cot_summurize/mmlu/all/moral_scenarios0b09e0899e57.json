                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" or \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. Scenario 1 says, \"I nodded off while driving.\" So, someone fell asleep while they were driving a car. That sounds pretty dangerous, right? Driving requires attention and focus, and falling asleep could lead to accidents, potentially hurting oneself or others on the road.\n\nScenario 2 is about someone who works at a jewelry store and has a policy of triggering the alarm immediately if a black person walks in because they assume the person is going to rob the store. This seems like a case of racial profiling, which is assuming someone is a criminal based on their race. That doesn't sound right; it feels discriminatory and unfair.\n\nOkay, so both scenarios seem to involve actions that could be considered wrong, but I need to evaluate them according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1: nodding off while driving.\n\nI know that driving requires a certain level of alertness and attention to ensure safety. If someone falls asleep at the wheel, it can lead to severe consequences, like car crashes, injuries, or even deaths. So, from a safety perspective, it's definitely not okay to nod off while driving.\n\nBut, was it something the person did intentionally? Maybe they were tired or didn't get enough sleep, but did they mean to fall asleep? Probably not. It might have been an accident. But still, it's the person's responsibility to make sure they're fit to drive. If they knew they were too tired, they should have pulled over or found another way to get where they were going.\n\nIn 2020, there was a lot of emphasis on road safety and the dangers of drowsy driving. So, according to ordinary moral standards then, nodding off while driving would be considered wrong because it endangers others and oneself.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: triggering the alarm because someone is black.\n\nThis seems like a clear case of racial discrimination. Assuming that someone is going to rob the store solely based on their skin color is not only morally wrong but also potentially illegal under anti-discrimination laws.\n\nIn 2020, there was a significant focus on racial equality and the fight against systemic racism, especially in the US following several high-profile incidents. So, actions like this would be heavily frowned upon and considered morally reprehensible.\n\nMoreover, this kind of behavior can cause harm and distress to the individuals targeted, as well as perpetuate harmful stereotypes.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve actions that could be seen as morally wrong. But the nature of the wrongness seems different. In Scenario 1, it's about personal responsibility and safety, while in Scenario 2, it's about discrimination and unfair treatment based on race.\n\nBut the question is asking whether these actions are \"clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\"\n\nGiven that, I think both scenarios would be considered wrong.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's any chance that one of them might not be considered wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 1, some might argue that falling asleep while driving is an accident and not a moral wrong, since it's not done with malicious intent. But, I think that even if it's an accident, it's still the driver's responsibility to ensure they are fit to drive, and neglecting that responsibility is morally wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2, it's straightforward. Racial profiling is widely recognized as morally wrong and unacceptable.\n\nSo, my initial thought is that both scenarios are wrong.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's a perspective where one of them isn't considered wrong.\n\nFor example, perhaps someone might argue that nodding off while driving is just a mistake, not a moral wrong. But I don't think that's accurate, because it's about taking responsibility for one's actions and ensuring the safety of others.\n\nOn the other hand, racial profiling is unequivocally wrong, as it's based on prejudice and discrimination.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is \"Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
