Hmm, I need to recall which of these animals reproduce by laying eggs.\n\nFirst, let's think about cows. Cows are mammals, right? And mammals typically give birth to live young, don't they? I remember that cows have babies, like calves, and they don't lay eggs. So, probably not A.\n\nNext, gerbils. Gerbils are also mammals. They're small rodents, and I think rodents generally give birth to live young as well. So, maybe not B.\n\nFrogs are amphibians. And I recall that amphibians usually lay eggs in water or moist environments. So, frogs do lay eggs, often in ponds or wet areas. This seems like a likely answer.\n\nElephants are also mammals, and they are known for giving birth to live calves, not laying eggs. So, probably not D.\n\nLet me just double-check. Cows, gerbils, and elephants are all mammals, and mammals typically give birth to live young, whereas frogs are amphibians and lay eggs.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. frog.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
