                    "text": "So I'm trying to answer this question about existential risks posed by AI, and it's asking which professor is most commonly associated with these risks. The options are Nando de Freitas, Yann LeCun, Stuart Russell, and Jitendra Malik. Hmm, I recognize all these names in the field of AI, but I need to figure out who specifically talks about the existential risks.\n\nFirst off, I know that existential risks refer to threats that could lead to the extinction or irreparable damage of humanity or the planet. In the context of AI, this usually means the potential for artificial general intelligence (AGI) or superintelligence to cause harm, either intentionally or unintentionally.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Nando de Freitas. He's a prominent figure in AI, currently involved with Google DeepMind. I recall that he's done a lot of work in machine learning and reinforcement learning. But I don't immediately associate him with discussions about existential risks from AI. Maybe he has spoken about it, but it's not his primary focus as far as I know.\n\nNext is Yann LeCun. He's famous for his work on deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks, which have revolutionized computer vision. He's the Director of AI Research at Facebook and a professor at New York University. While he talks about the responsible development of AI, I don't think existential risks are his main area of focus.\n\nThen there's Stuart Russell. He's a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and he's well-known for his work on artificial intelligence, including writing a popular textbook on the subject. I think he has been quite vocal about the potential risks of AI, including existential risks. I remember he's involved in the AI safety community and has written about the importance of ensuring that superintelligent machines remain aligned with human values.\n\nLastly, Jitendra Malik. He's also a professor at UC Berkeley, known for his work in computer vision and machine learning. While he's made significant contributions to AI, I don't recall him specifically discussing existential risks from AI.\n\nBased on this thinking, Stuart Russell seems to be the most fitting answer. He has a substantial track record of engaging with the topic of AI safety and existential risks. He's written books and papers on ensuring that AI remains beneficial to humanity, even as it becomes more powerful.\n\nLet me double-check this. I can try to recall if any of the other professors have written books or been particularly active in campaigns or organizations focused on existential risks from AI.\n\nNando de Freitas is more known for his research in deep learning and reinforcement learning. Yann LeCun is primarily known for his work on convolutional neural networks and deep learning architecture. Jitendra Malik is renowned for his contributions to computer vision and image understanding.\n\nStuart Russell, on the other hand, has been involved in the AI safety discussion for quite some time. He's authored \"Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Alignment,\" which directly addresses the issue of ensuring that advanced AI systems do not pose existential risks to humanity.\n\nGiven this information, it seems clear that Stuart Russell is the professor most commonly associated with discussing existential risks posed by AI.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Stuart Russell}} \\]"
