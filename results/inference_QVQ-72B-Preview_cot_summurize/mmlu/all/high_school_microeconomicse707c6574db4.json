                    "text": "Let's see here. So, if consumers are told that multigrained bread can really help reduce the risk of cancer, that sounds pretty convincing. I mean, health is a big deal, right? So, I would imagine that more people would want to buy multigrained bread because of this information.\n\nNow, in economics, when something becomes more desirable, like multigrained bread in this case, it usually means that the demand for it increases. And when demand increases, if the supply stays the same, the price tends to go up. So, from that logic, it seems like the demand curve would shift to the right, and the price would increase.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA. The demand curve will shift to the left, decreasing the price of multigrained bread.\n\nBut if the bread is now perceived as healthier, wouldn't demand increase, not decrease? Shifting demand to the left would mean less demand, which doesn't seem to align with the scenario.\n\nB. The supply curve will shift to the left, increasing the price of multigrained bread.\n\nSupply shifting to the left means producers are supplying less at every price, which might happen if production costs increase or something, but in this case, the change is in consumer perception, not in production costs. So, why would supply decrease? Doesn't make much sense.\n\nC. The demand curve will shift to the right, increasing the price of multigrained bread.\n\nThis seems more plausible. If demand increases because people think the bread is healthier, and supply remains constant, then yes, the price should go up.\n\nD. The supply curve will shift to the right, decreasing the price of multigrained bread.\n\nSupply shifting to the right means producers are supplying more at every price, which could happen if they see an increase in demand and decide to produce more. But, in the short term, supply might not adjust that quickly. Moreover, if demand is increasing, and supply remains constant, price should increase, not decrease.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think about this more carefully. Perhaps there's a trick here.\n\nLet me consider the standard supply and demand graph. The demand curve is downward sloping, and the supply curve is upward sloping. Equilibrium is where they intersect.\n\nIf consumer perception changes, making multigrained bread more desirable, that's a change in demand, not supply. So, the demand curve should shift outward to the right, indicating increased demand. Assuming supply remains constant, this would lead to a higher equilibrium price and possibly a higher quantity sold.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems correct: demand curve shifts to the right, increasing the price of multigrained bread.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's something about supply shifting as well.\n\nIf producers see that multigrained bread is in higher demand because of this health advice, they might be incentivized to produce more of it. So, in the long run, supply might increase, shifting the supply curve to the right. But in the short term, supply might not adjust that quickly.\n\nHowever, the question doesn't specify a time frame, so it's a bit ambiguous. But I think the immediate effect would be an increase in demand, leading to a higher price, assuming supply doesn't change immediately.\n\nOption D suggests supply shifts to the right, decreasing the price, but that would require both an increase in supply and a decrease in price, which doesn't align with the scenario described.\n\nOption B suggests supply shifts to the left, increasing the price, but there's no reason to believe that supply would decrease in this scenario. In fact, if demand increases, supply might eventually increase in response, but again, that's more of a long-term adjustment.\n\nOption A suggests demand shifts to the left, decreasing the price, which contradicts the idea that the bread is now perceived as healthier and more desirable.\n\nTherefore, the most logical answer is option C: the demand curve will shift to the right, increasing the price of multigrained bread.\n\nI think that's the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
