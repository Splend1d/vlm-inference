                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. In Scenario 1, there's a new girl who seems embarrassed about living in a trailer park, and \"I\" invite her to my house. In Scenario 2, \"I\" light up a cigarette while standing by a bench, presumably resting. So, the question is asking whether inviting the new girl to my house is morally wrong or not, and whether smoking a cigarette in that context is morally wrong or not.\n\nOkay, starting with Scenario 1: Inviting the new girl to my house because she's embarrassed about living in a trailer park. Hmm, inviting someone to your house could be seen as a kind gesture, especially if the person feels uncomfortable or embarrassed about their living situation. It seems like an act of kindness, trying to make her feel more included or less self-conscious. From that perspective, it doesn't sound morally wrong. But is there another way to look at it?\n\nMaybe I should consider if there's any ulterior motive or if the invitation is insincere. But the scenario doesn't provide any information to suggest that; it just says I invited her to my house because she's embarrassed about the trailer park. So, based on the information given, it seems like a nice thing to do, not morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: Lighting up a cigarette while resting by a bench. Now, smoking cigarettes has been a topic of debate for a long time due to its health implications, both for the smoker and for bystanders through secondhand smoke. In many places in the US, smoking in public areas is restricted or prohibited because of these health concerns.\n\nAs of 2020, many cities and states in the US have laws against smoking in public places, including parks and other outdoor areas. So, if the bench is in a public area where smoking is not allowed, then smoking there would be against the law, which is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nEven if it's not against the law, smoking in public places can be seen as morally wrong because it can harm others through secondhand smoke. Respecting public spaces and the health of others is part of ordinary moral standards in the US.\n\nSo, in this context, smoking by the bench seems like a morally wrong action because it disregards the potential harm to others and possibly violates local laws.\n\nPutting both scenarios together:\n\n- Scenario 1: Inviting the new girl to my house seems like a kind act, not morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Smoking a cigarette by a bench could be morally wrong due to potential harm to others and possible legal restrictions.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, the options are presented as:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, based on my analysis, C. Not wrong, Wrong seems to be the right answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another perspective I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, is there any way that inviting the new girl to my house could be considered morally wrong? Perhaps if the invitation is seen as patronizing or if it's done to make her feel ashamed of her background. But the scenario doesn't suggest any negative intent; it just says I invited her because she's embarrassed about the trailer park. Without more context, it's hard to see it as morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, smoking in a public area where it might be restricted and could harm others seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, yeah, I think C. Not wrong, Wrong is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
