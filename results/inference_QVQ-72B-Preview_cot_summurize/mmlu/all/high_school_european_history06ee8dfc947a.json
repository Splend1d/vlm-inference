                    "text": "So I've got this passage to read and then answer a question based on it. Let's see what it's about.\n\nIt starts with someone shouting to the narrator that something's been posted at the district mayor's office. The narrator runs to Rue Drout and reads a message that says, \"The First Day of Mobilization Will Be Sunday, August 2 [1914].\" That sounds significant\u2014mobilization means preparing for war, right? So, August 2, 1914, is when France started preparing for war.\n\nThe narrator feels dead tired but exhilarated and goes to their newspaper's office, bursting into Georges Clemenceau's office. Clemenceau was a prominent figure in French politics, I believe he was a prime minister during World War I. But in this passage, he's referred to as the chief of the newspaper.\n\nThe narrator tells Clemenceau that Paris is singing, meaning people are happy and celebratory about the war starting. Clemenceau responds, \"It will be all right then.\"\n\nThe question is: From the passage, one may infer that Clemenceau...\n\nOptions are:\n\nA. was disgusted to hear that Paris was reacting with joy at the advent of war\n\nB. had grave doubts about France's ability to win a war against Germany\n\nC. would one day serve as prime minister of France\n\nD. was relieved to hear that Paris was reacting with joy at the advent of war\n\nAlright, let's think about this.\n\nFirst, the passage doesn't indicate that Clemenceau was disgusted by the public's reaction. In fact, his response suggests he's reassured by it. So option A seems unlikely.\n\nOption B suggests he had doubts about France winning against Germany. The passage doesn't provide any information about his thoughts on the outcome of the war. He just responds positively to the public's morale.\n\nOption C is interesting. Clemenceau did serve as Prime Minister of France during World War I, but this passage is from around 1914, and he became Prime Minister in 1917. So, at the time of this passage, he wasn't Prime Minister yet. The passage doesn't predict his future political career, so option C seems like a stretch.\n\nOption D says he was relieved to hear that Paris was reacting with joy. His response, \"It will be all right then,\" does suggest that he feels better or more confident knowing that the public is supportive and enthusiastic.\n\nSo, based on the information in the passage, option D seems the most plausible inference.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's more to it.\n\nThe narrator is exhilarated and reports that Paris is singing, meaning people are cheerful and supportive. Clemenceau's response is positive, indicating that he sees this as a good thing.\n\nThere's no indication in the passage that he's disgusted or doubtful. The fact that he's relieved aligns with his positive reaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D: was relieved to hear that Paris was reacting with joy at the advent of war.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
