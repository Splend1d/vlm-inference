From what I remember, market segmentation is when a company divides its target market into smaller groups based on shared characteristics, like age, income, or interests, and then tailors its marketing strategies to those specific groups.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A is about Phillips marketing its product to all residents of the European Union with one marketing mix based on the concept 'Sense and Sensibility.' Hmm, this sounds like they're using the same marketing approach for everyone in the EU, which would be more of a undifferentiated marketing strategy, not segmentation. So, probably not the answer.\n\nOption B says that high-income and low-income consumers are being treated the same at Marks and Spencer (M&S). If M&S is not differentiating between these groups and offering the same products and marketing to both, then this also doesn't sound like market segmentation. Maybe they're using a undifferentiated approach or focusing on a broader segment that includes both income levels.\n\nOption C mentions a garden nursery seeing residents of urban areas and rural areas as one market needing trees. So, instead of separating them into different segments, they're considering them as a single market. Again, this seems like they're not segmenting the market, but rather seeing it as a whole. So, probably not an example of segmentation.\n\nOption D is about Honda separating its potential customers into economy car buyers and luxury car buyers. This sounds more like segmentation. They're dividing their market based on the type of car customers are interested in, which could be related to factors like income, lifestyle, or preferences. By targeting these distinct groups with different types of cars, Honda is tailoring its products and likely its marketing efforts to each segment.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option D is the best example of a segmented market.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In option A, Phillips is using one marketing mix for the entire EU, which is more of a standardized approach, not segmentation. Option B, M&S is treating high-income and low-income consumers the same, which might be a strategy, but it's not segmentation if they're not differentiating their offerings or marketing based on income segments.\n\nOption C, the garden nursery is considering urban and rural residents as one market, meaning they're not segmenting based on location, which again points to a non-segmented approach.\n\nOption D clearly indicates that Honda is dividing its customers into two distinct groups: economy car buyers and luxury car buyers. This is a classic example of market segmentation, where the company recognizes different needs and preferences among its customers and adjusts its product offerings accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Honda separating its potential customers into economy car buyers and luxury car buyers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
