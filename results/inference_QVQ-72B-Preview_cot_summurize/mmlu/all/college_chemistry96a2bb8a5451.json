                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out the strength of a 13C 90\u00b0 pulse with a duration of 1 microsecond. The options are 3.72 mT, 5.18 mT, 17.0 mT, and 23.3 mT. I'm not entirely sure about the relationship between the pulse angle, duration, and the magnetic field strength, so I need to recall some basic principles of NMR spectroscopy.\n\nFirst off, I know that in NMR, a radiofrequency (RF) pulse is used to excite the nuclei, and the angle of this pulse is important for different types of experiments. A 90\u00b0 pulse means that it should tip the magnetization vector by 90 degrees from the equilibrium position.\n\nThe relationship between the pulse angle, the magnetic field strength (B1), and the pulse duration (\u03c4) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\gamma \\cdot B_1 \\cdot \\tau\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(\\theta\\) is the pulse angle (90 degrees in this case),\n\n- \\(\\gamma\\) is the gyromagnetic ratio of the nucleus,\n\n- \\(B_1\\) is the strength of the RF field,\n\n- \\(\\tau\\) is the pulse duration.\n\nWait, actually, I think the correct formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\gamma \\cdot B_1 \\cdot \\tau\n\\]\n\nBut I recall that in some contexts, there might be a factor of \\(\\pi\\) involved, so I need to be careful here. Let me double-check.\n\nYes, the standard formula is indeed \\(\\theta = \\gamma \\cdot B_1 \\cdot \\tau\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is in radians, \\(\\gamma\\) is in radians per tesla per second, \\(B_1\\) is in teslas, and \\(\\tau\\) is in seconds.\n\nGiven that, I need to convert the pulse angle from degrees to radians because the formula requires radians. I know that 180 degrees is equal to \\(\\pi\\) radians, so:\n\n\\[\n90^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need the gyromagnetic ratio for 13C. I remember that for 13C, \\(\\gamma\\) is approximately 10.7052 MHz/Tesla. But wait, the units are in MHz per Tesla, which is frequency per tesla. However, the formula requires \\(\\gamma\\) in radians per tesla per second.\n\nSo, I need to convert the gyromagnetic ratio to the correct units. I know that 1 MHz is equal to \\(10^6\\) Hz, and since angular frequency \\(\\omega\\) is \\(2\\pi f\\), where \\(f\\) is the frequency in Hz, I can convert \\(\\gamma\\) accordingly.\n\nGiven that, for 13C:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = 10.7052 \\, \\text{MHz/T} = 10.7052 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{Hz/T} = 10.7052 \\times 10^6 \\times 2\\pi \\, \\text{rad/s/T}\n\\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = 10.7052 \\times 10^6 \\times 2\\pi \\approx 67.27 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{rad/s/T}\n\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's recalculate:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = 10.7052 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{Hz/T} = 10.7052 \\times 10^6 \\times 2\\pi \\, \\text{rad/s/T} = 10.7052 \\times 10^6 \\times 6.2832 \\approx 67.27 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{rad/s/T}\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, \\(\\gamma \\approx 67.27 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{rad/s/T}\\).\n\nNow, plugging the values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\pi}{2} = 67.27 \\times 10^6 \\times B_1 \\times 1 \\times 10^{-6}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\pi}{2} = 67.27 \\times B_1 \\times 10^{-6}\n\\]\n\nWait, actually, since \\(\\gamma\\) is in rad/s/T and \\(\\tau\\) is in seconds, the units should work out directly.\n\nLet me solve for \\(B_1\\):\n\n\\[\nB_1 = \\frac{\\pi / 2}{\\gamma \\cdot \\tau} = \\frac{\\pi / 2}{67.27 \\times 10^6 \\times 1 \\times 10^{-6}}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the numerator:\n\n\\[\n\\pi / 2 \\approx 1.5708 \\, \\text{rad}\n\\]\n\nDenominator:\n\n\\[\n67.27 \\times 10^6 \\times 1 \\times 10^{-6} = 67.27 \\, \\text{rad/s/T}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nB_1 = \\frac{1.5708}{67.27} \\approx 0.0233 \\, \\text{T}\n\\]\n\nConverting to milliteslas:\n\n\\[\n0.0233 \\, \\text{T} = 23.3 \\, \\text{mT}\n\\]\n\nSo, according to this calculation, the B1 field strength should be approximately 23.3 mT, which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming the gyromagnetic ratio conversion:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = 10.7052 \\, \\text{MHz/T} = 10.7052 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{Hz/T} = 10.7052 \\times 10^6 \\times 2\\pi \\, \\text{rad/s/T} \\approx 67.27 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{rad/s/T}\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, the formula is indeed \\(\\theta = \\gamma \\cdot B_1 \\cdot \\tau\\), with \\(\\theta\\) in radians.\n\nGiven \\(\\theta = \\pi / 2\\), \\(\\gamma = 67.27 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{rad/s/T}\\), and \\(\\tau = 1 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{s}\\), the calculation for \\(B_1\\) is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 23.3 mT.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this or if there's any additional factor I might have missed.\n\nI recall that in some NMR literature, the B1 field is sometimes expressed in terms of frequency offset, but in this case, the question directly provides the pulse angle and duration, so the straightforward approach should be sufficient.\n\nAlso, sometimes the pulse angle formula might include a factor of 2 or \\(\\pi/2\\), depending on the convention used, but in standard NMR theory, the formula is as I've used.\n\nGiven that, I'm confident that the calculation is correct, and the answer is indeed D. 23.3 mT.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{D}"
