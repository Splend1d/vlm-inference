Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\n\nD. Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices\n\nI need to figure out which one of these was the first standardized assessment tool.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what a standardized measure of assessment means. Standardized tests are those that are administered and scored in a consistent manner. They usually have norms that allow for the comparison of scores across different individuals.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Stanford Binet: I know that the Stanford Binet is an intelligence test that was developed from the original Binet-Simon scale. It was adapted by Lewis Terman at Stanford University. But is it the first standardized measure?\n\nB. Binet-Simon Scale: This was the original intelligence test developed by Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon in France. It was designed to identify students who needed special help in school. It was later revised and became the basis for the Stanford Binet.\n\nC. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS): This was developed by David Wechsler and was first published in 1939. It's another intelligence test that provides both verbal and performance scores. But again, is this the first standardized measure?\n\nD. Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices: This is a non-verbal test of general intelligence. It was designed by John C. Raven in 1938. It's widely used and doesn't require reading or writing skills, which makes it useful for a broad range of people.\n\nHmm, I need to think about the timeline here. Which of these tests was developed first?\n\nBinet and Simon developed their scale in 1905. That was the first intelligence test, right? The Stanford Binet was an adaptation of that, done by Lewis Terman in 1916. So, Binet-Simon Scale came before Stanford Binet.\n\nThe Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale was published in 1939, which is after both the Binet-Simon and Stanford Binet.\n\nRaven\u2019s Progressive Matrices was first published in 1938, which is also after the Binet-Simon Scale and Stanford Binet.\n\nSo, based on this, the Binet-Simon Scale seems to be the earliest one among these options.\n\nBut wait, is there any earlier standardized measure? Maybe something even before Binet-Simon?\n\nI think Binet-Simon was indeed the first standardized intelligence test. Before that, assessments were more subjective and not standardized in the way we think of it today.\n\nLet me double-check this. I recall that Binet and Simon were commissioned by the French ministry of education to develop a method to identify children who were falling behind in school. Their scale was the first to provide a systematic way to assess intelligence through a series of tasks.\n\nThe Stanford Binet was an adaptation of the Binet-Simon Scale, aimed at American populations. It introduced the concept of mental age and intelligence quotient (IQ).\n\nThe Wechsler scales came later, introducing deviations IQs based on age norms, which was a significant improvement over earlier tests.\n\nRaven\u2019s Progressive Matrices was developed as a culture-fair test, focusing on abstract reasoning.\n\nSo, chronologically, Binet-Simon Scale comes first, then Stanford Binet, then Wechsler scales, and finally Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices.\n\nTherefore, the first standardized measure of assessment among these options is the Binet-Simon Scale.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is asking for the first standardized measure of assessment. Is there a possibility that there were other standardized measures before Binet-Simon?\n\nI don't think so. Binet-Simon Scale was groundbreaking because it provided a standardized way to assess intelligence, with clear instructions and scoring methods.\n\nMaybe I should consider if there were any other standardized tests in other domains before Binet-Simon. For example, in psychology, there might have been other types of standardized assessments, but I'm not sure.\n\nHowever, based on my knowledge, the Binet-Simon Scale was the first standardized psychological assessment tool.\n\nSo, I think the answer should be B. Binet-Simon Scale.\n\nBut let's see if there's any other perspective that might make another option the correct answer.\n\nPerhaps if the question is referring to the first standardized measure in a specific context, like for adults or in a particular country, but the question is quite general.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"standardized measure of assessment\" could refer to any type of standardized test, not necessarily an intelligence test. But all the options provided are intelligence tests, so that's probably the context.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the question is trying to trick me by including both Binet-Simon and Stanford Binet, and expecting me to choose Stanford Binet because it's more famous.\n\nBut no, Binet-Simon was indeed earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the first standardized measure that is still widely used today. In that case, perhaps Stanford Binet or Wechsler scales would qualify, but again, Binet-Simon was earlier.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The straightforward answer is that the first standardized measure of assessment was the Binet-Simon Scale.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. Binet-Simon Scale.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
