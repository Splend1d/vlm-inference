                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"A group of students played a basketball game after school. Which total can be found using the expression 7 x 2?\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. The total number of points if a player made 7 shots and each shot was worth 2 points.\n\nB. The total number of basketballs if 7 basketballs were old and 2 basketballs were new.\n\nC. The total number of points if one player had 7 points and a different player had 2 points.\n\nD. The total number of basketballs used if there were 7 basketballs and 2 of the basketballs were not used.\n\nAlright, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the expression 7 x 2 represents. Multiplication is about combining groups of equal size. So, 7 x 2 means there are 7 groups of 2 things each or 2 groups of 7 things each, depending on the context.\n\nLet's look at option A: If a player made 7 shots and each shot was worth 2 points, then the total points would be 7 shots times 2 points per shot. That sounds like 7 multiplied by 2, which is 14 points.\n\nOption B: There are 7 old basketballs and 2 new basketballs. To find the total number of basketballs, I would add 7 and 2 together, which is 7 + 2 = 9. But the expression is 7 x 2, which is 14, so this doesn't match.\n\nOption C: One player has 7 points and another has 2 points. Again, to find the total points, I would add 7 and 2, which is 9. That's not 7 x 2 = 14.\n\nOption D: There are 7 basketballs in total, and 2 were not used. So, the number of basketballs used would be 7 minus 2, which is 5. Again, not 14.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm missing something. Let's double-check each option.\n\nOption A seems straightforward. If one player made 7 shots, each worth 2 points, then total points are indeed 7 multiplied by 2, which is 14. So, this matches the expression 7 x 2.\n\nOption B is about adding two separate groups of basketballs: 7 old and 2 new. Adding them gives 7 + 2 = 9, which is not the same as 7 x 2.\n\nOption C is similar: adding two different players' points, 7 + 2 = 9, not 14.\n\nOption D: Subtracting the unused basketballs from the total: 7 - 2 = 5, which also doesn't match 7 x 2.\n\nSo, based on this, option A is the only one that uses the expression 7 x 2 correctly to find the total points.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the options.\n\nIn option B, maybe the \"7 old and 2 new\" could be interpreted differently. Perhaps each old basketball counts as 1 and each new one counts as 2 or something like that. But the way it's phrased, it seems like just adding the numbers.\n\nOption C: It's clear that it's just adding two different players' points, not multiplying.\n\nOption D: It's about subtraction, not multiplication.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is option A.\n\nWait, but let's see if there's any other way option A could be interpreted. If a player made 7 shots, and each shot is worth 2 points, then yes, that's 7 times 2 points, which is 14 points in total.\n\nIs there any other context where 7 x 2 would apply in this scenario? Not really, from what's given.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option A: The total number of points if a player made 7 shots and each shot was worth 2 points.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
