                    "text": "Let's tackle this logic problem step by step. I need to construct a truth table for the given argument and then determine if it's valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I have to pick the correct counterexample from the options provided.\n\nFirst, let's understand the argument. It has the form:\n\nP \u2283 Q\n\nQ \u00b7 R / ~P \u00b7 R\n\nThis looks like a conditional and a conjunction leading to another conjunction. I need to translate this into standard form to make it clearer. The argument seems to be:\n\nPremise 1: P \u2283 Q\n\nPremise 2: Q \u00b7 R\n\nConclusion: ~P \u00b7 R\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. The way it's written, it's a bit ambiguous. Let's see:\n\nP \u2283 Q\n\nQ \u00b7 R / ~P \u00b7 R\n\nI think it's:\n\nFrom P \u2283 Q and Q \u00b7 R, conclude ~P \u00b7 R.\n\nSo, premises:\n\n1. P \u2283 Q\n\n2. Q \u00b7 R\n\nConclusion:\n\n~P \u00b7 R\n\nAlright, now I need to make a truth table for all possible truth values of P, Q, and R, and see if the argument holds in all cases.\n\nFirst, list all possible truth value combinations for P, Q, and R. Since there are three variables, there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations.\n\nLet's list them:\n\n1. P: T, Q: T, R: T\n\n2. P: T, Q: T, R: F\n\n3. P: T, Q: F, R: T\n\n4. P: T, Q: F, R: F\n\n5. P: F, Q: T, R: T\n\n6. P: F, Q: T, R: F\n\n7. P: F, Q: F, R: T\n\n8. P: F, Q: F, R: F\n\nNow, for each of these, I need to evaluate the premises and the conclusion.\n\nFirst, Premise 1: P \u2283 Q\n\nThis is a conditional, meaning if P is true, then Q is true. It's only false when P is true and Q is false.\n\nPremise 2: Q \u00b7 R\n\nThis is a conjunction, meaning both Q and R are true.\n\nConclusion: ~P \u00b7 R\n\nThis is a conjunction where ~P (not P) and R are both true.\n\nSo, for each row, I need to check if both premises are true, and if so, does that make the conclusion true?\n\nIf there's any row where both premises are true but the conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid.\n\nLet's evaluate each premise and the conclusion for all eight rows.\n\nRow 1:\n\nP: T, Q: T, R: T\n\nPremise 1: P \u2283 Q \u2192 T \u2283 T \u2192 T\n\nPremise 2: Q \u00b7 R \u2192 T \u00b7 T \u2192 T\n\nConclusion: ~P \u00b7 R \u2192 ~T \u00b7 T \u2192 F \u00b7 T \u2192 F\n\nSo, premises are both true, conclusion is false. This is a counterexample.\n\nWait, but let's check all rows to be thorough.\n\nRow 2:\n\nP: T, Q: T, R: F\n\nPremise 1: T \u2283 T \u2192 T\n\nPremise 2: T \u00b7 F \u2192 F\n\nConclusion: ~T \u00b7 F \u2192 F \u00b7 F \u2192 F\n\nHere, Premise 2 is false, so no need to check conclusion.\n\nRow 3:\n\nP: T, Q: F, R: T\n\nPremise 1: T \u2283 F \u2192 F\n\nPremise 2: F \u00b7 T \u2192 F\n\nConclusion: ~T \u00b7 T \u2192 F \u00b7 T \u2192 F\n\nPremise 1 is false, so no need to check conclusion.\n\nRow 4:\n\nP: T, Q: F, R: F\n\nPremise 1: T \u2283 F \u2192 F\n\nPremise 2: F \u00b7 F \u2192 F\n\nConclusion: ~T \u00b7 F \u2192 F \u00b7 F \u2192 F\n\nPremise 1 is false.\n\nRow 5:\n\nP: F, Q: T, R: T\n\nPremise 1: F \u2283 T \u2192 T\n\nPremise 2: T \u00b7 T \u2192 T\n\nConclusion: ~F \u00b7 T \u2192 T \u00b7 T \u2192 T\n\nHere, both premises are true, conclusion is true.\n\nRow 6:\n\nP: F, Q: T, R: F\n\nPremise 1: F \u2283 T \u2192 T\n\nPremise 2: T \u00b7 F \u2192 F\n\nConclusion: ~F \u00b7 F \u2192 T \u00b7 F \u2192 F\n\nPremise 2 is false.\n\nRow 7:\n\nP: F, Q: F, R: T\n\nPremise 1: F \u2283 F \u2192 T\n\nPremise 2: F \u00b7 T \u2192 F\n\nConclusion: ~F \u00b7 T \u2192 T \u00b7 T \u2192 T\n\nPremise 2 is false.\n\nRow 8:\n\nP: F, Q: F, R: F\n\nPremise 1: F \u2283 F \u2192 T\n\nPremise 2: F \u00b7 F \u2192 F\n\nConclusion: ~F \u00b7 F \u2192 T \u00b7 F \u2192 F\n\nPremise 2 is false.\n\nSo, only in Row 1 do both premises hold, and there the conclusion is false. Therefore, the argument is invalid, and Row 1 is a counterexample.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Valid\n\nB. Invalid. Counterexample when P, R, and Q are true\n\nC. Invalid. Counterexample when P and Q are true and R is false\n\nD. Invalid. Counterexample when R and Q are true and P is false\n\nWait, in Row 1, P is true, Q is true, R is true. So, that matches option B.\n\nBut let's double-check if there are other rows where both premises are true and conclusion is false.\n\nLooking back, only Row 1 has both premises true, and there conclusion is false.\n\nSo, the argument is invalid, and the counterexample is when P, Q, and R are all true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check the other options.\n\nOption C: P and Q are true, R is false.\n\nLooking at Row 2: P true, Q true, R false.\n\nBut in Row 2, Premise 2 is false, so no counterexample there.\n\nOption D: R and Q are true, P is false.\n\nLooking at Row 5: P false, Q true, R true.\n\nIn Row 5, both premises are true, and conclusion is true, so not a counterexample.\n\nOption A: Valid, but we've shown it's invalid with Row 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
