                    "text": "So I have this question about maximizing total utility from sardines. It's asking when the total utility is maximized in terms of purchasing sardines. The options are:\n\nA. Marginal utility is zero\n\nB. Marginal benefit equals marginal cost\n\nC. Consumer surplus is zero\n\nD. Distributive efficiency is achieved\n\nOkay, let's break this down. I need to recall some basic economic concepts here.\n\nFirst, total utility is the total satisfaction or benefit a person gets from consuming a good or service. Marginal utility is the additional utility gained from consuming one more unit of that good or service.\n\nSo, in this case, we're talking about buying sardines. Each additional can of sardines I buy gives me some extra utility, but probably, as I buy more and more, each new can gives me less additional utility than the previous one. That's the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n\nNow, to maximize total utility, I need to find the point where adding another can of sardines doesn't increase my total utility anymore, or where the benefit from the last can equals the cost.\n\nLet me think about option A: marginal utility is zero. Does that mean I stop buying sardines when the additional utility from the last can is zero? Hmm. That seems like I'd stop buying when the last can doesn't give me any extra satisfaction. So, total utility is maximized because adding another can would add zero to total utility. That makes sense.\n\nBut wait, I've heard somewhere that in utility maximization, you set marginal utility equal to zero. Is that right?\n\nOption B: marginal benefit equals marginal cost. This sounds familiar. In economics, the optimal consumption point is where the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost. So, for sardines, the benefit from the last can should equal the cost of that can.\n\nBut hold on, in standard consumer choice theory, we usually set marginal utility per dollar spent equal across all goods. But maybe in this context, it's simplified to just MB = MC for sardines.\n\nOption C: consumer surplus is zero. Consumer surplus is the difference between what a consumer is willing to pay and what they actually pay. If consumer surplus is zero, that means the price is equal to the willingness to pay. Not sure if that's the point of maximized total utility.\n\nOption D: distributive efficiency is achieved. I'm not sure what distributive efficiency means in this context. Maybe it's related to distributional equity or something, but that seems out of place here.\n\nLet me consider this again. I think the key is to relate marginal utility to the price paid. In utility maximization, the consumer chooses the quantity where marginal utility equals the price paid, assuming the good is normal and there are no externalities.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in the standard model, the consumer chooses quantity where marginal utility per dollar is equal across all goods. But here, we're focusing only on sardines, so maybe we can simplify.\n\nLet me think about the mathematical approach. Suppose total utility is a function of the number of sardines, say U = f(Q), where Q is quantity of sardines. To maximize total utility, we take the derivative of U with respect to Q and set it equal to zero.\n\nSo, dU/dQ = MU = 0. That would be option A.\n\nBut, in reality, there's a budget constraint. I have to consider the cost of each additional can. So, perhaps it's more accurate to set marginal benefit equal to marginal cost, which aligns with option B.\n\nWait, but in microeconomics, for a single good, marginal benefit is often equated with marginal utility, and marginal cost is the price per unit, assuming no production costs are considered.\n\nSo, in that case, MU = P, where P is the price of sardines.\n\nBut if I'm to maximize total utility, given a budget, I need to allocate my spending such that the last dollar spent on each good provides the same marginal utility.\n\nBut again, since we're focusing only on sardines, maybe we can think of it differently.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that total utility is maximized when the marginal utility from the last can equals the price paid, i.e., MU = P.\n\nBut that seems similar to option B, where marginal benefit equals marginal cost.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to rephrase.\n\nIn consumer choice theory, the optimal quantity of a good is where MU = P (price per unit), assuming no other goods are consumed.\n\nBut in reality, consumers buy multiple goods, and they set MU/P equal across goods to maximize total utility subject to their budget constraint.\n\nBut here, the question is specifically about sardines, so maybe we can consider that the consumer is only buying sardines, or that sardines are the main variable in this scenario.\n\nSo, if I only buy sardines, I would buy until MU from sardines equals their price.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the marginal benefit from sardines equals the marginal cost, that also makes sense.\n\nWait, maybe marginal benefit is just another way of saying marginal utility, and marginal cost is the price.\n\nSo, MB = MU = P.\n\nTherefore, option B seems correct.\n\nBut option A says marginal utility is zero. Is that the same as MU = P?\n\nNot really. If MU = 0, that's different from MU = P.\n\nUnless P is zero, which is unlikely.\n\nSo, perhaps option A is incorrect, unless in some special cases.\n\nOption C: consumer surplus is zero. Consumer surplus is total utility minus total expenditure.\n\nIf CS = 0, that means total utility equals total expenditure, or U = P*Q.\n\nBut is that the point of maximization? Not necessarily.\n\nI think consumer surplus is maximized when consumption is optimal, but it's not zero.\n\nOption D: distributive efficiency. I'm not sure what this refers to in this context. Maybe it's about fair distribution, but that seems unrelated to utility maximization for sardines.\n\nSo, between options A and B, I'm leaning towards B: marginal benefit equals marginal cost.\n\nBecause in standard microeconomics, the optimal consumption point is where the marginal benefit from the last unit equals the marginal cost of that unit.\n\nIn this case, MB would be the additional satisfaction from the last can of sardines, and MC would be the cost of that can.\n\nSo, buying sardines until MB = MC would maximize total utility.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf I buy one more can, and MB > MC, then it's worth buying because the benefit exceeds the cost.\n\nIf MB < MC, then it's not worth buying that extra can.\n\nSo, the optimal point is where MB = MC.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nOption A, marginal utility is zero, might be a point where total utility is maximized, but it's not the general rule for maximization.\n\nIn fact, in some cases, MU could approach zero but not necessarily be zero at the optimal consumption level.\n\nSo, perhaps option A is not accurate in all scenarios.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B: marginal benefit equals marginal cost.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
