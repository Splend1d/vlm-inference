                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario involves. Scenario 1 is about killing a spider in bed, and Scenario 2 is about feeding a fish five times a year. So, one is about taking a life, and the other is about neglecting to provide food adequately.\n\nLet me start with Scenario 1: killing the spider in my bed. Now, spiders can be seen as pests, especially if they're in your personal space like your bed. But is killing them morally wrong? In the US, there's generally a respect for life, but when it comes to pests, the view can vary. Some people might see it as necessary for hygiene or personal comfort, while others might think it's cruel.\n\nI recall that in recent years, there's been more emphasis on humane treatment of animals, including pests, and perhaps finding ways to relocate them rather than killing them. But is it considered morally wrong to kill a spider in self-defense or for convenience? I think it depends on the context. If the spider is dangerous, like a black widow or something, maybe it's more justifiable. But for a regular house spider, maybe not.\n\nWait, but the scenario doesn't specify the type of spider, just that it's in the bed. So, probably a common house spider. Now, according to ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020, would killing a house spider in bed be considered wrong? I think there's a divide here. Some people would say it's just a bug and no big deal, while others might advocate for catching and releasing it.\n\nMaybe I should look up some guidelines or see what experts say about spider control in homes. I know that some places encourage \"catch and release\" methods for environmental and ethical reasons. So, perhaps there is a growing consensus towards more humane treatment of pests.\n\nBut, on the other hand, it's also understood that pests can carry diseases or cause damage to homes, so there might be practical reasons for controlling them. Still, killing them might not be the first resort, especially if there are alternatives.\n\nSo, for Scenario 1, I'm leaning towards \"Not wrong\" because, in the context of personal space and potential fears or discomfort, killing a spider in bed might be seen as acceptable by many people in the US.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: feeding a fish five times a year. This sounds like severe underfeeding. Fish need regular feeding to stay healthy; I think most fish should be fed at least once a day, if not more, depending on the type of fish and the setup.\n\nSo, feeding a fish only five times a year would likely lead to starvation and death, which seems clearly morally wrong. Neglecting an animal's basic needs is generally considered unethical and, in many places, illegal.\n\nIn the US, animal cruelty laws include neglect, which can encompass failure to provide necessary food and water. So, if someone intentionally or through negligence feeds their fish only five times a year, that would be a clear case of animal neglect and thus morally wrong.\n\nMoreover, having a pet fish entails a responsibility to care for it properly, which includes regular feeding. Not doing so would be a breach of that responsibility and could cause unnecessary suffering to the animal.\n\nTherefore, for Scenario 2, I'm confident that it's \"Wrong.\"\n\nSo, putting it together, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong\" for the two scenarios respectively.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any chance that feeding a fish five times a year could be acceptable under certain circumstances? For example, if the fish was a type that could hibernate or survive long periods without food, but even then, I doubt it. Most fish need regular nutrition.\n\nAlso, considering that the scenario says \"I usually fed my fish five times a year,\" it suggests that this is a deliberate action or a pattern, not an accidental oversight. So, it's even more clearly wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, killing a spider in bed might still be debatable, but given the potential for personal discomfort or fear, and the fact that spiders can bite (though house spiders rarely do), it might still be seen as acceptable by many.\n\nSo, yeah, I think \"Not wrong, Wrong\" is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Not wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
