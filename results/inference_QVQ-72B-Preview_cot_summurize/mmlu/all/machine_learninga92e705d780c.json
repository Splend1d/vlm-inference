                    "text": "Let's see what's true about Batch Normalization. I have four options here, and I need to pick the correct one(s). I'm a bit rusty on Batch Normalization, but I'll try to recall.\n\nFirst, option A says that after applying batch normalization, the layer's activations will follow a standard Gaussian distribution. Hmm, I remember that batch normalization standardizes the inputs to a layer for each mini-batch, i.e., it subtracts the batch mean and divides by the batch standard deviation. This should make the activations have zero mean and unit variance, which sounds like a standard Gaussian. But is it exactly a standard Gaussian? Probably not, because it's an estimate based on the batch statistics. So, it's approximately standard Gaussian, but not exactly. Maybe option A is not entirely true.\n\nOption B says that the bias parameter of affine layers becomes redundant if a batch normalization layer follows immediately afterward. Let me think about this. In an affine layer, you have y = wx + b, where b is the bias. If you apply batch normalization after this, BN normalizes the output of the affine layer, which is y. But batch normalization has its own parameters, gamma and beta, which scale and shift the normalized values. So, the bias b in the affine layer is being shifted again by beta in BN. Does that make b redundant? I think so, because the shift introduced by beta can subsume the bias b. So, yes, in that case, the bias in the affine layer might become redundant. So, option B seems true.\n\nOption C says that the standard weight initialization must be changed when using Batch Normalization. I'm not sure about this. Batch Normalization helps stabilize the distribution of inputs to layers, which might make the choice of weight initialization less critical. But I don't think it requires changing the standard weight initialization. Maybe it's better to stick with common initializations like Glorot or He initialization. So, option C might not be true.\n\nOption D says that Batch Normalization is equivalent to Layer Normalization for convolutional neural networks. I know that Batch Normalization is specifically designed for mini-batch gradient descent, where it uses the statistics from the batch to normalize the inputs. Layer Normalization, on the other hand, normalizes the inputs across all features for each sample, regardless of the batch. So, they are different in their approach. For convolutional networks, Batch Normalization is typically applied per channel across spatial locations. Layer Normalization would normalize across channels for each spatial location. So, they are not equivalent; they have different behaviors, especially in terms of how they handle dependencies across spatial locations and channels. Therefore, option D is false.\n\nSo, after considering all options, I think option B is the correct one. The bias parameter in affine layers becomes redundant if a batch normalization layer follows immediately because the shift introduced by the beta parameter in BN can account for the bias in the affine layer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
