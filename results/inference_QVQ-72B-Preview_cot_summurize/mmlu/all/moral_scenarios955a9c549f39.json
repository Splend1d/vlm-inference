                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. In Scenario 1, it says, \"I make sure my high-watt security light doesn't aim in my neighbor's bedroom window.\" So, someone has a bright security light, and they're taking care to direct it in a way that it doesn't shine into their neighbor's bedroom window. That seems considerate, right? Like, they're thinking about how their light might affect their neighbors and making sure it doesn't cause any inconvenience or discomfort.\n\nOn the other hand, in Scenario 2, it says, \"I swung a pillow at my best friend James.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit different. Swinging a pillow at someone could be playful, but it could also be seen as aggressive or harmful, depending on the context and intent.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, what constitutes a morally wrong action? Generally, moral wrongs involve harming others, either physically, emotionally, or violating their rights or privacy.\n\nLet's apply this to both scenarios.\n\nIn Scenario 1, by making sure the security light doesn't aim into the neighbor's bedroom window, the person is actually being considerate and respectful of their neighbor's privacy and comfort. If the light were shining into the bedroom, it could disrupt the neighbor's sleep or feel intrusive. By directing the light elsewhere, they're avoiding potential harm or annoyance to their neighbor. So, in this case, it seems like they're doing the right thing, not something morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, swinging a pillow at a best friend could be interpreted in different ways. If it's done in a playful manner during a pillow fight with consent, it might not be morally wrong. However, if it's done out of anger or without consent, it could be considered aggressive and potentially harmful, both physically and emotionally. Given that it's specified as \"swung a pillow at,\" it suggests a forceful action, which might not be appropriate, especially if it could cause harm to James.\n\nBut wait, the scenario doesn't provide context about the intent or the relationship dynamics. James is described as the \"best friend,\" which might imply a close relationship where playful antics are common. In that case, swinging a pillow might be part of friendly banter or playfighting, which isn't necessarily morally wrong.\n\nHowever, without specific context, I have to consider the action on its own terms. Swinging a pillow at someone could be seen as an act of aggression or an attempt to cause harm, especially if it's done without the person's consent or in a harmful manner.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 shows consideration for a neighbor's well-being and privacy, while Scenario 2 involves an action that could potentially harm a friend, depending on the context.\n\nGiven that, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 seems morally acceptable, whereas Scenario 2 could be morally wrong, depending on the context.\n\nBut the question is to choose among options: both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong.\n\nOption A: Wrong, Wrong\n\nOption B: Wrong, Not wrong\n\nOption C: Not wrong, Wrong\n\nOption D: Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 could be wrong, depending on the context. However, since the context for Scenario 2 isn't specified, and it could be interpreted as playful or aggressive, I need to make a judgment call.\n\nI think the safest choice is Option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBecause even if the pillow swinging is playful, there's a risk of harm, and it's generally not acceptable to swing objects at people without consent, especially if it could cause injury.\n\nWhereas in Scenario 1, the person is actively avoiding causing harm or inconvenience to their neighbor, which is morally commendable.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
