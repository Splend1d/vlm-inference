                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about valuing a stock using the growing perpetuity formula. The company last paid a dividend of $3, the expected return on equity is 12%, and the current share price is $75. I need to find the dividend growth rate that makes all this consistent.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a growing perpetuity is. It's a financial concept where a series of cash flows grows at a constant rate forever. In this case, the cash flows are dividends, so the dividend is expected to grow at a constant rate each period.\n\nThe formula for the present value of a growing perpetuity is:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{D}{r - g} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( PV \\) is the present value of the perpetuity.\n\n- \\( D \\) is the expected cash flow (dividend) in the next period.\n\n- \\( r \\) is the discount rate (expected return on equity).\n\n- \\( g \\) is the constant growth rate of the dividend.\n\nWait a minute, the formula I have in my notes is sometimes written as:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{D_1}{r - g} \\]\n\nWhere \\( D_1 \\) is the dividend at time 1.\n\nBut in this problem, it says the last dividend was $3. So, is \\( D \\) the last dividend paid or the next dividend expected?\n\nI think \\( D \\) here is the expected dividend next period, so if the last dividend was $3 and it's growing at rate \\( g \\), then \\( D = 3 \\times (1 + g) \\).\n\nBut the problem mentions that the shares are currently quoted at $75, which should be equal to the present value of the future dividends, i.e., \\( PV = 75 \\).\n\nSo, plugging into the formula:\n\n\\[ 75 = \\frac{3 \\times (1 + g)}{0.12 - g} \\]\n\nBecause \\( r = 12\\% = 0.12 \\), and \\( g \\) is the growth rate we're trying to find.\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\( g \\) in this equation.\n\nLet me write it again:\n\n\\[ 75 = \\frac{3(1 + g)}{0.12 - g} \\]\n\nFirst, I can multiply both sides by \\( (0.12 - g) \\) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[ 75(0.12 - g) = 3(1 + g) \\]\n\nNow, let's expand both sides:\n\nLeft side:\n\n\\[ 75 \\times 0.12 - 75 \\times g = 9 - 75g \\]\n\nRight side:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 1 + 3 \\times g = 3 + 3g \\]\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n\\[ 9 - 75g = 3 + 3g \\]\n\nNow, I'll bring like terms together. Let's add \\( 75g \\) to both sides to eliminate the \\( -75g \\) on the left:\n\n\\[ 9 = 3 + 78g + 3g \\]\n\nWait, no. Adding \\( 75g \\) to both sides would give:\n\n\\[ 9 + 75g = 3 + 3g \\]\n\nNow, I'll subtract \\( 3 \\) from both sides to get:\n\n\\[ 6 + 75g = 3g \\]\n\nWait, no. Wait a second, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check.\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[ 9 - 75g = 3 + 3g \\]\n\nAdding \\( 75g \\) to both sides:\n\n\\[ 9 = 3 + 78g \\]\n\nWait, no. \\( -75g + 75g = 0 \\), so:\n\n\\[ 9 = 3 + 3g + 75g \\]\n\n\\[ 9 = 3 + 78g \\]\n\nOkay, now that makes sense.\n\nSo, now subtract 3 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 6 = 78g \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 78:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{6}{78} \\]\n\nSimplify that fraction:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{1}{13} \\]\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n\\[ g \\approx 0.0769 \\]\n\nSo, the growth rate is approximately 7.69%, but looking at the options, none of them match this. The options are 0%, 8%, 16%, and -4%.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to check my calculations again.\n\nLet me go through the steps once more.\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\[ 75 = \\frac{3(1 + g)}{0.12 - g} \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( (0.12 - g) \\):\n\n\\[ 75(0.12 - g) = 3(1 + g) \\]\n\nExpand both sides:\n\n\\[ 9 - 75g = 3 + 3g \\]\n\nNow, add 75g to both sides:\n\n\\[ 9 = 3 + 78g \\]\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 6 = 78g \\]\n\nDivide by 78:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{6}{78} = \\frac{1}{13} \\approx 0.0769 \\]\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but it's not matching the options. Maybe I need to consider if the growth rate is negative or something, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the formula. Let me check the growing perpetuity formula again.\n\nThe present value \\( PV \\) of a growing perpetuity is indeed:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{D_1}{r - g} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( PV \\) is the current price of the stock.\n\n- \\( D_1 \\) is the expected dividend in the next period.\n\n- \\( r \\) is the required rate of return.\n\n- \\( g \\) is the constant growth rate.\n\nIn this problem, the last dividend was $3, so \\( D_0 = 3 \\), and \\( D_1 = 3 \\times (1 + g) \\).\n\nSo, plugging into the formula:\n\n\\[ 75 = \\frac{3(1 + g)}{0.12 - g} \\]\n\nWhich is what I had before.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the growing perpetuity formula is written as:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{D_0 \\times (1 + g)}{r - g} \\]\n\nWhich is the same as above.\n\nSo, my calculation seems correct, but the answer isn't in the options. Maybe there's a mistake in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dividend is not growing from the last period's dividend but from the current dividend. But the problem says the last dividend was $3, so I think \\( D_1 = 3 \\times (1 + g) \\) is correct.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the expected return includes the dividend yield plus the growth rate. So, the total return is dividend yield plus growth rate:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{D_1}{P} + g \\]\n\nRearranged:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{D_1}{r - g} \\]\n\nWhich is the same as the formula I used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dividend is growing forever, and the present value is the sum of all future dividends discounted back to today.\n\nI think I'm on the right track, but the answer isn't matching the options.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the growth rate could be negative. Let's see what happens if \\( g \\) is negative.\n\nIf \\( g \\) is negative, say \\( g = -0.04 \\), then:\n\n\\[ 75 = \\frac{3(1 - 0.04)}{0.12 - (-0.04)} = \\frac{3 \\times 0.96}{0.16} = \\frac{2.88}{0.16} = 18 \\]\n\nBut 18 is not equal to 75, so that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, if \\( g = 0.08 \\):\n\n\\[ 75 = \\frac{3(1 + 0.08)}{0.12 - 0.08} = \\frac{3.24}{0.04} = 81 \\]\n\nWhich is not equal to 75.\n\nIf \\( g = 0.16 \\):\n\n\\[ 75 = \\frac{3(1 + 0.16)}{0.12 - 0.16} = \\frac{3.48}{-0.04} = -87 \\]\n\nNegative price doesn't make sense, so that can't be right.\n\nIf \\( g = 0\\% \\):\n\n\\[ 75 = \\frac{3(1 + 0)}{0.12 - 0} = \\frac{3}{0.12} = 25 \\]\n\nNot equal to 75.\n\nHmm, none of these options seem to work. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem or the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dividend is not growing from the last period but from a different base. But the problem says \"the last paid dividend,\" so I think \\( D_1 = 3 \\times (1 + g) \\) is correct.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe the expected return is not the required rate of return, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the share price is misquoted. If the price is $75, and the last dividend was $3, with an expected return of 12%, then using the formula:\n\n\\[ 75 = \\frac{3(1 + g)}{0.12 - g} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( g \\), as I did before, gives \\( g = \\frac{1}{13} \\approx 7.69\\% \\), which isn't among the options.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider more decimal places. Let's solve it more accurately.\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[ 75(0.12 - g) = 3(1 + g) \\]\n\n\\[ 9 - 75g = 3 + 3g \\]\n\n\\[ 9 - 3 = 78g \\]\n\n\\[ 6 = 78g \\]\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{6}{78} = \\frac{1}{13} \\approx 0.076923 \\]\n\nStill approximately 7.69%, which isn't matching the options.\n\nMaybe the problem expects a different approach. Let's consider the dividend growth rate in terms of the stock price.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expected return is the sum of the dividend yield and the growth rate:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{D_1}{P} + g \\]\n\nRearranged:\n\n\\[ g = r - \\frac{D_1}{P} \\]\n\nBut I need \\( D_1 \\), which is \\( 3(1 + g) \\), so that seems circular.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use trial and error with the given options.\n\nLet's try \\( g = 8\\% = 0.08 \\):\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{3(1 + 0.08)}{0.12 - 0.08} = \\frac{3.24}{0.04} = 81 \\]\n\nWhich is higher than $75.\n\nIf \\( g = 0\\% \\):\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{3}{0.12} = 25 \\]\n\nWhich is lower than $75.\n\nIf \\( g = 16\\% = 0.16 \\):\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{3(1 + 0.16)}{0.12 - 0.16} = \\frac{3.48}{-0.04} = -87 \\]\n\nNegative price doesn't make sense.\n\nIf \\( g = -4\\% = -0.04 \\):\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{3(1 - 0.04)}{0.12 - (-0.04)} = \\frac{2.88}{0.16} = 18 \\]\n\nStill not $75.\n\nThis suggests that none of the provided options result in a present value of $75, which is confusing.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the problem setup. Perhaps the expected return is not 12%, or maybe the dividend is not $3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that the dividend growth rate is part of the expected return.\n\nWait, perhaps the expected return is the sum of the dividend yield and the growth rate:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{D_1}{P} + g \\]\n\nRearranged:\n\n\\[ g = r - \\frac{D_1}{P} \\]\n\nBut I still need \\( D_1 \\), which is \\( 3(1 + g) \\), so it's still circular.\n\nThis is getting tricky. Maybe I need to approach it differently.\n\nLet me consider the present value formula again:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{D_1}{r - g} \\]\n\nAnd I know \\( PV = 75 \\), \\( D_1 = 3(1 + g) \\), \\( r = 0.12 \\), and I need to find \\( g \\).\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ 75 = \\frac{3(1 + g)}{0.12 - g} \\]\n\nLet me try to solve this equation for \\( g \\).\n\nFirst, express it as:\n\n\\[ 75(0.12 - g) = 3(1 + g) \\]\n\n\\[ 9 - 75g = 3 + 3g \\]\n\n\\[ 9 - 3 = 78g \\]\n\n\\[ 6 = 78g \\]\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{6}{78} = \\frac{1}{13} \\approx 0.076923 \\]\n\nWhich is approximately 7.69%, but that's not among the options.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the growth rate is expressed as a percentage, so 7.69% is roughly 8%, which is option B.\n\nBut earlier when I tried \\( g = 0.08 \\), I got \\( PV = 81 \\), which is higher than $75.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust my calculation.\n\nLet me plug \\( g = 0.076923 \\) back into the formula:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{3(1 + 0.076923)}{0.12 - 0.076923} = \\frac{3.230789}{0.043077} \\approx 75 \\]\n\nYes, that's approximately $75.\n\nSo, the growth rate is about 7.69%, which rounds to 8%, which is option B.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried \\( g = 0.08 \\), I got \\( PV = 81 \\), which is higher than $75.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use a more precise value.\n\nLet me set up the equation again:\n\n\\[ 75 = \\frac{3(1 + g)}{0.12 - g} \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( (0.12 - g) \\):\n\n\\[ 75(0.12 - g) = 3(1 + g) \\]\n\n\\[ 9 - 75g = 3 + 3g \\]\n\n\\[ 9 - 3 = 78g \\]\n\n\\[ 6 = 78g \\]\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{6}{78} = \\frac{1}{13} \\approx 0.076923 \\]\n\nWhich is approximately 7.69%, closest to 8%.\n\nBut to confirm, let's plug \\( g = 0.076923 \\) back into the formula:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{3(1 + 0.076923)}{0.12 - 0.076923} = \\frac{3.230789}{0.043077} \\approx 75 \\]\n\nYes, that matches the current share price.\n\nTherefore, the dividend growth rate should be approximately 7.69%, which rounds to 8%.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 8%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
