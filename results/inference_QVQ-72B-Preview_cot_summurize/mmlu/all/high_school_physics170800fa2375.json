                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about electromagnetic radiation and I need to find out which type has the longest wavelength from the options given. The options are gamma rays, ultraviolet, blue light, and orange light. I remember that in the electromagnetic spectrum, different types of radiation have different wavelengths, and generally, the spectrum goes from the shortest wavelengths like gamma rays up to the longest wavelengths like radio waves.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the order of the electromagnetic spectrum. Starting from the shortest wavelengths: gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, microwave, and radio waves. So, among the options provided, gamma rays have the shortest wavelength, and radio waves would have the longest, but radio waves aren't listed here. So, among A. Gamma rays, B. Ultraviolet, C. Blue light, D. Orange light, which one has the longest wavelength?\n\nLet me think about the visible light spectrum. Visible light is a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and it includes colors from violet to red, with violet having the shortest wavelength and red having the longest wavelength in this range. So, blue light is shorter in wavelength than orange light because blue is closer to violet, which has shorter wavelengths, while orange is closer to red, which has longer wavelengths.\n\nUltraviolet radiation has shorter wavelengths than visible light, so it's shorter than both blue and orange light. Gamma rays have even shorter wavelengths than ultraviolet.\n\nSo, if I list these in order of increasing wavelength:\n\nA. Gamma rays (shortest)\n\nB. Ultraviolet\n\nC. Blue light\n\nD. Orange light (longest among the options)\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be D. Orange light.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that. Maybe I can look up the wavelengths for each type to be sure.\n\nI know that the electromagnetic spectrum is organized by wavelength, with gamma rays having the shortest wavelengths and radio waves having the longest. Since radio waves aren't included here, I need to focus on the visible and nearby regions.\n\nUltraviolet light has wavelengths just shorter than visible light, ranging approximately from 10 to 400 nanometers (nm), with visible light ranging from about 400 to 700 nm.\n\nWithin visible light:\n\n- Violet: approximately 400-450 nm\n\n- Blue: 450-490 nm\n\n- Green: 490-570 nm\n\n- Yellow: 570-590 nm\n\n- Orange: 590-620 nm\n\n- Red: 620-700 nm\n\nSo, according to this, orange light has a longer wavelength compared to blue light, which is consistent with what I thought earlier.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this.\n\nIs there any chance that in a specific context, orange light could have a shorter wavelength than blue? No, that doesn't seem right. The standard wavelength ranges place orange at a longer wavelength than blue.\n\nWhat about the fact that different sources might have slight variations in these ranges? Well, yes, but generally, the trend remains that orange is longer in wavelength than blue.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that as we move from violet to red in the visible spectrum, the wavelengths increase. So, blue is towards the violet side, and orange is towards the red side.\n\nTherefore, orange light has the longest wavelength among the options provided.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the longest wavelength,\" and since radio waves aren't listed, orange light is indeed the longest among the given options.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Orange light.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
