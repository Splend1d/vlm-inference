Joan Woodward, C. Rensis Likert, and D. Fred Fiedler. Hmm, I need to recall who among these is known for contributing to the contingency theory of leadership.\n\nFirst off, I remember that contingency theory suggests that there is no one best way to lead and that effective leadership depends on the situation. So, different situations might require different leadership styles. Now, I need to think about which of these individuals is associated with this theory.\n\nLet me start by considering Fred Fiedler. I think he developed something called the contingency model of leadership effectiveness. He believed that a leader's effectiveness depends on both their personal characteristics and the environment they're in. That sounds a lot like contingency theory. Maybe he's the one.\n\nBut wait, I should check about the others too. Rosabeth Kanter, I know she's a management theorist, but I don't recall her being directly associated with contingency theory of leadership. Maybe she has other contributions, but not specifically to this theory.\n\nJoan Woodward, I think she did some work on organizational structure and environmental influences, but again, not directly related to leadership theories. So, perhaps she's not the main writer on contingency theory of leadership.\n\nRensis Likert, he's famous for his work on management styles and organizational behavior. He proposed a four-system model of management, which focuses on different leadership styles and their impact on organizational performance. While his work is related to leadership, I don't think he's specifically known for contingency theory.\n\nGoing back to Fred Fiedler, I recall that his contingency model is one of the earliest situational leadership theories. He introduced the concept that a leader's style is contingent upon the favorableness of the situation. He measured this favorableness using factors like leader-member relations, task structure, and position power. So, this seems directly aligned with contingency theory.\n\nI should also consider if any of the others have similar contributions. Rosabeth Kanter is known for her work on diversity and empowerment in organizations, which is important but not directly tied to contingency theory of leadership.\n\nJoan Woodward studied the relationship between organizational structure and technological processes, which is more about organization design than leadership theories.\n\nRensis Likert's work on management systems is more about the overall approach to managing an organization rather than the specific situational factors that contingency theory emphasizes.\n\nTherefore, based on what I recall, Fred Fiedler is the leading writer on contingency theory of leadership among the given options. His model specifically addresses how leadership effectiveness is contingent upon the interaction between the leader's style and the situational context.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check my memory. Contingency theory indeed emphasizes that there is no single best way to lead and that effective leadership depends on various situational factors. Fiedler's model aligns perfectly with this perspective, as it matches different leadership styles to different situational contexts based on the leader's inherent tendencies.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is D. Fred Fiedler.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
