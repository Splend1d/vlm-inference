                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. It's a bit complex, but if I break it down, I can manage it.\n\nFirst, understand what the problem is asking: We have a microcomputer that needs to process four analog input signals in real-time, digitize them, compute their average, and output that average continuously. The goal is to find the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the system to keep up with the input-output data rates.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Time to digitize one input: 12 microseconds\n\n- Five CPU instructions for each digitization\n\n- Ten CPU instructions to average each set of four samples and output\n\n- Suitable data buffering is employed\n\n- Ignore time for digital to analog conversion\n\nWe need to find the maximum average instruction execution time.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the total time required for digitizing four inputs.\n\nTime to digitize one input: 12 microseconds\n\nFor four inputs: 4 * 12 = 48 microseconds\n\nFor each digitization, five CPU instructions are executed. So for four digitizations: 4 * 5 = 20 instructions\n\nThen, to average the four samples and output, ten instructions are executed: 10 instructions\n\nTotal instructions per set of four samples: 20 + 10 = 30 instructions\n\nNow, the system needs to process these four inputs and output their average continually. Assuming data buffering, the system can process the next set of four inputs while outputting the previous average.\n\nBut since digitization and processing are sequential, we need to ensure that the instruction execution time doesn't cause a backlog.\n\nThe critical part is the digitization time and the instruction execution time.\n\nThe digitization time is 48 microseconds for four inputs.\n\nThe instruction execution time for 30 instructions is what we need to find, and it should be such that the total time for digitization and instruction execution doesn't exceed the time between output averages.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions that the system outputs the average continually, and buffering is employed. So, perhaps the output can be done while the next set is being digitized and processed.\n\nBut to keep it simple, let's first calculate the total time required for one cycle:\n\n- Digitize four inputs: 48 microseconds\n\n- Execute 30 instructions: 30 * (average instruction execution time)\n\nThe total cycle time should be less than or equal to the time between outputs, which is the time to process and output one set of four samples.\n\nBut what is the time between outputs? The problem doesn't specify a rate for outputs, only that it's continual with buffering.\n\nPerhaps, since digitization takes 48 microseconds, and instruction execution takes some time, the output can be done while the next set is being processed.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of throughput.\n\nEach cycle consists of:\n\n- Digitizing four inputs: 48 microseconds\n\n- Executing 30 instructions: 30 * T, where T is the average instruction execution time\n\n- Outputting the average: negligible time (ignored)\n\nSo, the total time per cycle is 48 + 30T microseconds.\n\nFor the system to keep up, the time per cycle should be less than or equal to the time between outputs.\n\nBut since outputs are continual and buffered, perhaps the output time is effectively zero, or it overlaps with the processing of the next set.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cycle time should be less than or equal to the digitization time, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nThe system needs to process four inputs, compute their average, and output it continually.\n\nGiven that digitization takes 48 microseconds, and instruction execution takes 30T microseconds, the total time per cycle is 48 + 30T microseconds.\n\nFor the system to keep up, this total time should be less than or equal to the time between outputs.\n\nBut what is the time between outputs? The problem doesn't specify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system processes one set of four inputs, outputs the average, and then moves on to the next set.\n\nIn that case, the time between outputs is the time to process one set, which is 48 + 30T microseconds.\n\nBut that seems circular.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rate is determined by the digitization time.\n\nSince digitization takes 48 microseconds for four inputs, perhaps the output rate is once every 48 microseconds.\n\nBut that seems too fast because the instruction execution time would need to be negligible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is done every 48 microseconds, and within that time, the system must complete digitization and instruction execution.\n\nSo, setting up the inequality:\n\n48 + 30T \u2264 48\n\nBut that would imply T \u2264 0, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is done immediately after processing, and the next set starts digitizing.\n\nIn that case, the time to process one set is 48 + 30T microseconds, and the time between outputs is the digitization time for the next set, which is 48 microseconds.\n\nBut again, that would require 48 + 30T \u2264 48, which implies T \u2264 0.\n\nThis suggests I'm missing something.\n\nPerhaps the instruction execution time is overlapped with the digitization time.\n\nMeaning, while one set is being digitized, the previous set is being processed.\n\nIn that case, the instruction execution time for one set can be overlapped with the digitization time of the next set.\n\nSo, if digitization takes 48 microseconds, and instruction execution takes 30T microseconds, to keep up, 30T should be less than or equal to 48 microseconds, assuming that instruction execution can start as soon as digitization is done.\n\nWait, but digitization is triggered by a CPU instruction, and five instructions are executed per digitization.\n\nSo, perhaps the sequence is:\n\n1. Trigger digitization of input 1 (includes 5 instructions)\n\n2. Wait 12 microseconds for digitization to complete\n\n3. Process input 1 (5 instructions)\n\n4. Repeat for inputs 2, 3, 4\n\n5. Average the four samples and output (10 instructions)\n\nSo, the digitization of each input is sequential, each taking 12 microseconds, with five instructions per digitization.\n\nSo, total digitization time: 4 * 12 = 48 microseconds\n\nTotal instructions for digitization: 4 * 5 = 20 instructions\n\nThen, averaging and output: 10 instructions\n\nTotal instructions: 20 + 10 = 30 instructions\n\nTotal time per cycle: time for digitization + time for instruction execution\n\nTime for digitization: 48 microseconds\n\nTime for instruction execution: 30 * T microseconds\n\nTotal time per cycle: 48 + 30T microseconds\n\nFor the system to keep up, this total time should be less than or equal to the time between outputs.\n\nBut what is the time between outputs?\n\nThe problem says \"continually,\" so outputs are happening at a certain rate.\n\nPerhaps the output rate is determined by the digitization time.\n\nSince digitization takes 48 microseconds for four inputs, perhaps outputs are happening every 48 microseconds.\n\nBut that seems too fast because the instruction execution time would need to be negligible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is done immediately after processing, and the next set starts digitizing.\n\nIn that case, the time to process one set is 48 + 30T microseconds, and the time between outputs is the digitization time for the next set, which is 48 microseconds.\n\nBut again, that would require 48 + 30T \u2264 48, which implies T \u2264 0.\n\nThis suggests that instruction execution time cannot be positive, which is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction execution time is overlapped with the digitization time.\n\nMeaning, while one set is being digitized, the previous set is being processed.\n\nIn that case, the instruction execution time for one set can be overlapped with the digitization time of the next set.\n\nSo, if digitization takes 48 microseconds, and instruction execution takes 30T microseconds, to keep up, 30T should be less than or equal to 48 microseconds, assuming that instruction execution can start as soon as digitization is done.\n\nSo, 30T \u2264 48\n\nT \u2264 48 / 30 = 1.6 microseconds\n\nSo, the maximum average instruction execution time is 1.6 microseconds.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 0.8 microseconds\n\nB. 1.2 microseconds\n\nC. 1.6 microseconds\n\nD. 2.4 microseconds\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 1.6 microseconds.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs it possible that the instruction execution time can be higher?\n\nWait, but according to the earlier reasoning, if 30T \u2264 48, then T \u2264 1.6 microseconds.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction execution time is overlapped with the digitization time in a different way.\n\nLet's consider that during the digitization time of 48 microseconds, the system can execute some instructions.\n\nThen, the remaining instructions must be executed during the time left in the cycle.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the instruction execution time during the digitization period.\n\nLet's see.\n\nDigitization time: 48 microseconds\n\nDuring this time, the CPU can execute instructions.\n\nAssuming that the CPU can execute instructions concurrently with digitization, then the instruction execution time can be overlapped with digitization.\n\nIn that case, the total instruction execution time should be less than or equal to the digitization time, so 30T \u2264 48.\n\nThus, T \u2264 1.6 microseconds.\n\nTherefore, the maximum average instruction execution time is 1.6 microseconds.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 1.6 microseconds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
