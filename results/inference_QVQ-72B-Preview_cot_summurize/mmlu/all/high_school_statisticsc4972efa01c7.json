                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a bakery and its bread demand. The mean daily demand is 2,500 loaves, and the standard deviation is 225 loaves. The bakery bakes 3,000 loaves every morning, and I need to find the probability that they'll run out of bread today, assuming the demand is normally distributed.\n\nAlright, first things first, since the demand is normally distributed with a mean of 2,500 and a standard deviation of 225, I need to find the probability that the demand exceeds the supply, which is 3,000 loaves.\n\nSo, if demand is a random variable, let's denote it as D, and it's normally distributed: D ~ N(2500, 225^2).\n\nThe bakery bakes 3,000 loaves, so I need to find P(D > 3000), which is the probability that demand is greater than 3,000.\n\nTo work with normal distributions, it's often easier to standardize the variable. So, I'll find the z-score for 3,000.\n\nThe z-score is calculated as z = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3, where X is the value, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: z = (3000 - 2500) / 225 = 500 / 225 = 2.222...\n\nSo, z \u2248 2.22.\n\nNow, I need to find P(D > 3000) = P(Z > 2.22).\n\nBut standard normal tables typically give P(Z < z), so I can find P(Z < 2.22) and then subtract it from 1.\n\nLooking up the standard normal table, P(Z < 2.22) \u2248 0.9869.\n\nTherefore, P(Z > 2.22) = 1 - 0.9869 = 0.0131.\n\nSo, the probability that the bakery will run out of bread is approximately 0.0131, or 1.31%.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.8333\n\nB. 0.1667\n\nC. 0.9869\n\nD. 0.0132\n\nMy answer of 0.0131 is closest to option D. 0.0132.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, calculating the z-score:\n\nz = (3000 - 2500) / 225 = 500 / 225 = 2.222..., that seems correct.\n\nLooking up the standard normal table for z = 2.22, P(Z < 2.22) \u2248 0.9869.\n\nThen, P(Z > 2.22) = 1 - 0.9869 = 0.0131.\n\nThe difference between my answer and option D is probably due to rounding, since the table might give P(Z < 2.22) as 0.9869 and 1 - 0.9869 = 0.0131, but option D is 0.0132.\n\nGiven that, I think it's safe to choose option D. 0.0132 as the closest answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the bakery bakes 3,000 loaves, and the demand is 2,500 with a standard deviation of 225.\n\nWait, but no, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that running out of bread means demand exceeds supply, which is D > 3000, which is what I calculated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to look at it, like considering the difference between supply and demand.\n\nBut no, I think the approach I took is straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the bakery bakes 3,000 loaves, and the demand is normally distributed with mean 2,500 and SD 225.\n\nSo, P(D > 3000) = P(Z > (3000 - 2500)/225) = P(Z > 2.222...)\n\nWhich is what I found.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a continuity correction since demand is a continuous variable, but in this case, since we're dealing with probabilities, and the question is about running out, which is demand exceeding supply, I think the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 0.0132.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
