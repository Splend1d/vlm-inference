                    "text": "So I have this question here about Anscombe's view on moral obligation. The options are:\n\nA. preference.\n\nB. maximizing utility.\n\nC. positive law.\n\nD. divine law.\n\nAnd the question is: Anscombe claims that the notion of moral obligation is derived from which of these concepts?\n\nFirst off, I need to recall who Anscombe is and what her philosophical views are, especially regarding ethics and moral obligation.\n\nGeraldine Mary Anscombe was an English philosopher who made significant contributions to philosophy of mind, metaphysics, and ethics. She was also a prominent figure in the development of virtue ethics, particularly through her critique of modern moral philosophy.\n\nNow, the question is specifically about where she thinks the notion of moral obligation comes from. Let's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: preference.\n\nIn philosophy, preferences can refer to desires or inclinations towards certain outcomes or states of affairs. Some ethical theories, like preference utilitarianism, base moral value on satisfying the preferences of individuals. However, Anscombe was critical of utilitarianism and other consequentialist theories that focus on outcomes. So, it seems unlikely that she would attribute the notion of moral obligation to preferences.\n\nOption B: maximizing utility.\n\nThis sounds very much like utilitarianism, which Anscombe was known to critique. Utilitarianism suggests that actions are morally right if they maximize overall happiness or utility. Given that Anscombe was critical of this approach, it's probably not the correct choice.\n\nOption C: positive law.\n\nPositive law refers to laws created and enforced by human beings, typically through legislative processes. While Anscombe did write about law and morality, her work in \"Modern Moral Philosophy\" suggests that she distinguished between legal obligations and moral obligations. She argued that modern moral philosophy had incorrectly equated moral\u4e49\u52a1 with legal obligations, which she saw as a mistake. So, again, this doesn't seem to align with her views on moral obligation.\n\nOption D: divine law.\n\nDivine law is based on the idea that moral obligations are derived from the commands or nature of a divine being, such as God. Anscombe was a Roman Catholic and her philosophical work was influenced by Thomistic philosophy, which emphasizes the role of divine law in ethics. In \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" she discusses the importance of natural law, which is closely related to divine law, as a foundation for moral obligations.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that Anscombe would attribute the notion of moral obligation to divine law. Her Thomistic influences and her critique of modern moral philosophy that downplays or ignores divine law further support this conclusion.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it a bit more. In \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" Anscombe argues that the concept of moral obligation has been misused in modern times, being tied too closely to the idea of duty imposed by law, rather than understood in terms of virtue and the natural law. She advocates for a return to a more Aristotelian and Thomistic understanding of ethics, where moral obligations are seen as flowing from our nature as rational beings and from the will of God.\n\nSo, in that context, divine law would indeed be a central component in deriving moral obligations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. divine law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
