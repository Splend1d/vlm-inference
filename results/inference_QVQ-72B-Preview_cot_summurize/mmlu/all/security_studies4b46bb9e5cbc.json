                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about differences in theorizing on both sides of the Atlantic, meaning the United States and Europe, I assume. The options are A, B, C, and D, and I need to pick which ones emerge as differences in their approaches to security studies or something along those lines. Let me read them carefully.\n\nOption A says, from a US perspective, it's common to regard the main voice of security as external. Hmm, that sounds a bit unclear. It might mean that in the US, the focus is on external threats to security, like other countries or non-state actors, rather than internal issues. Then it mentions the question of what should or should not count as security issues and how to conceptualize security. So, maybe it's about the definition and scope of security studies in the US.\n\nOption B talks about the European school being based on a hegemonic form of knowledge. Hegemonic means dominating or having dominant influence. So, perhaps European approaches to security are influenced by a particular dominant ideology or perspective. It also says knowledge is conceived as understanding causal mechanisms in relation to the material on which they act. That sounds like a realist or materialist approach, focusing on cause and effect in security matters.\n\nOption C mentions different forms of knowledge relate to a conflicting conception of the relationship to policy: problem-solving tradition in US political science versus critical studies in Europe. So, this seems to suggest that in the US, the approach is more about solving practical problems, while in Europe, it's more about critical analysis and perhaps challenging existing systems or policies.\n\nOption D says theorizing has parallel theoretical forms of knowledge based on empirically substantiated cause-and-effect relationships. This sounds like both sides use empirical evidence and causal analysis in their theories, which might indicate similarities rather than differences.\n\nAlright, so I need to identify which of these options represent differences in theorizing between the US and Europe. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, option A seems to suggest that in the US, security is seen more from an external perspective, and there's a debate about what constitutes security issues. This could be a difference in focus, with the US perhaps emphasizing external threats more than internal ones.\n\nOption B talks about the European school being based on hegemonic knowledge and a materialist approach. This might indicate that European theories are influenced by a dominant ideology or perspective and focus on material causes and effects.\n\nOption C directly contrasts the US problem-solving tradition with European critical studies. This seems like a clear difference in approach: one is about finding solutions to existing problems, while the other is about critically examining and possibly challenging the status quo.\n\nOption D suggests that both sides use empirical evidence and causal analysis, which points to similarities in their theoretical approaches.\n\nGiven these considerations, options A, B, and C seem to highlight differences in focus, perspective, and approach between the US and European theorizing, whereas option D points to a similarity.\n\nTherefore, the differences that emerge are likely to be options A, B, and C.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"differences emerged with regard to theorizing on both sides of the Atlantic.\" It doesn't specify how many differences there are, just which ones emerge as differences.\n\nSo, if I had to choose among these options, I would select A, B, and C as the ones that highlight differences in theorizing between the US and Europe.\n\nBut, the way the question is phrased, \"what differences emerged...?\" It might be expecting multiple choices, but it's phrased in a way that suggests selecting the differences that emerged, possibly more than one.\n\nHowever, in standard multiple-choice formatting, especially in written form, each option is typically independent, and you might need to select all that apply.\n\nBut, given that option D suggests a similarity, it's probably not a difference and therefore not something to select.\n\nSo, my final answer would be A, B, and C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A, B, C} \\]"
