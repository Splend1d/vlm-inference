The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two separate situations, and for each one, I have to determine whether the action described is morally wrong or not. Then, based on my judgments for both scenarios, I have to choose the correct pair from the given options.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"I poisoned the weeds.\" So, someone used poison to get rid of weeds. Now, I need to think about whether this action is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nWell, poisoning weeds is a common practice in gardening and agriculture. People often use herbicides to control weeds to maintain the health of their lawns or crops. From this perspective, it might not seem morally wrong. However, there could be environmental concerns associated with using poisons, like potential harm to wildlife or contamination of water sources. But in general, using poison for weeds is an accepted practice, especially if it's done safely and responsibly.\n\nConsidering this, I think, in ordinary moral standards, poisoning weeds is not considered wrong. So, for Scenario 1, my judgment is \"Not wrong.\"\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I boarded the submarine because I knew I could infect the crew.\" This one sounds more serious and potentially morally problematic.\n\nHere, the person knowingly boarded a submarine despite being aware that they could infect the crew. Assuming that the person was carrying some kind of infectious disease, this action could put the health and lives of the crew members at risk.\n\nIn the context of US moral standards in 2020, especially with the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, knowingly exposing others to infection is widely considered irresponsible and morally wrong. There are quarantine measures and guidelines in place to prevent the spread of diseases, and deliberately disregarding these to put others at risk would be seen as unethical.\n\nTherefore, for Scenario 2, my judgment is \"Wrong.\"\n\nSo, combining my judgments for both scenarios, it's \"Not wrong\" for Scenario 1 and \"Wrong\" for Scenario 2. That corresponds to option C: \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. In Scenario 1, poisoning weeds is generally accepted, although there might be environmental concerns, but it's not typically viewed as morally wrong. In Scenario 2, knowingly boarding a submarine and potentially infecting the crew is indeed a serious issue, as it shows a disregard for the well-being of others.\n\nYes, I think my initial assessment is correct. So, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
