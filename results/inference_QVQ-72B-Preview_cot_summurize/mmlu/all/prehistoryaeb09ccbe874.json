                    "text": "So I have this question here about Aurignacian and Mousterian technology. It's asking how they differ, and there are four options. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Aurignacian and Mousterian technologies are. I think Mousterian is associated with Neanderthals, right? And Aurignacian is maybe from modern humans or something like that. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics.\n\nOption A says that Mousterian technology produced more projectile points. Hmm, projectile points are like arrowheads or spear points, right? I think Neanderthals mainly used hand-held weapons, not projectiles. So, maybe Aurignacian technology produced more projectile points? But the option says Mousterian did, so maybe that's not correct.\n\nOption B says Mousterian technology produced more usable blade surface. Blades are long, thin pieces, like knives or tools for cutting. Neanderthals were known for making flake tools, but I think later technologies produced more blades. So, maybe Mousterian didn't produce more usable blade surface?\n\nOption C says Aurignacian technology produced more usable blade surface. Aurignacian is generally considered a later technology, and I think blades became more common in later prehistory. So, this might be a possibility.\n\nOption D says Aurignacian technology was focused on the production of hand axes. Hand axes were more characteristic of the Acheulean technology, which was before Mousterian, I believe. Neanderthals mainly made flake tools, not hand axes. So, maybe Aurignacian didn't focus on hand axes.\n\nLet me try to summarize what I know:\n\n- Mousterian technology: associated with Neanderthals, typically involved the Levallois technique for making flint flakes, which were then shaped into tools like scrapers, points, and blades.\n\n- Aurignacian technology: associated with early modern humans, characterized by the production of blades rather than flakes, and a wider range of tools including engraved bone and antler artifacts.\n\nSo, based on this, Mousterian technology was more about flakes and some blades, while Aurignacian technology was more focused on blades and had a greater variety of tools.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Mousterian technology produced more projectile points.\n\n- I think Aurignacian technology produced more projectile points, as modern humans developed better ways to hunt with projectiles.\n\nB. Mousterian technology produced more usable blade surface.\n\n- Mousterian technology did produce some blades, but not as extensively as Aurignacian technology.\n\nC. Aurignacian technology produced more usable blade surface.\n\n- This seems accurate, as Aurignacian technology is known for its blade production.\n\nD. Aurignacian technology was focused on the production of hand axes.\n\n- Hand axes were more common in Acheulean technology, not Aurignacian. Aurignacian technology was more about blades and other types of tools.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. Aurignacian technology produced more usable blade surface.\n\nJust to make sure, let me check again. Did Mousterian technology produce more projectile points? No, I don't think so. Neanderthals primarily used thrusting spears, not projectile points. Did Mousterian technology produce more usable blade surface? While they did produce some blades, it wasn't as prominent as in Aurignacian technology. And Aurignacian technology was indeed focused on blade production, not hand axes.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. Aurignacian technology produced more usable blade surface.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
