A process of securitization is when an issue not included in the political sphere becomes politicized and is managed within the political system. A securitized issue is part of public policy requiring governmental action; decision-making, resource allocation and even communal governance.\nB. A securitizing actor can argue for an issue to be securitised when it is outside of the political domain. An existential threat can be made a matter for state attention even when it is not included within public debate. Securitization refers to the recognition of the threat prior to its emergence in the political process.\nC. Securitization refers to the move of issues from a politicized state to a heightened state of politics beyond the normal political domain of decision-making activities. Once placed above the political sphere it cannot be returned to the public sphere, having been translated into a state interest above normal proceedings.\nD. An issue can be securitized, that is framed as a security question, when it is moved from the politicized to the securitized sphere. During the securitization process, the securitizing actor(s) use discourse to persuade an audience that the issue at hand is one of urgency and priority, and that it presents an existential threat to some referent object.\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about securitization. It seems a bit complex at first glance, but I think I can work through it.\n\nSo, the question is: \"How is a process of securitization completed?\" And there are four options to choose from. I need to pick the one that best explains how securitization happens.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand what securitization means. From what I recall, securitization is a process where an issue is framed as a security threat, which then allows it to be handled outside of normal political procedures. It's about escalating an issue to a point where it's seen as so critical that it requires urgent and exceptional measures.\n\nOption A says that securitization is when an issue not included in the political sphere becomes politicized and is managed within the political system. But wait, that seems contradictory. If it's becoming politicized, it's entering the political sphere, not being securitized and moved beyond it. Securitization is about moving an issue from the political into the security domain, not the other way around. So, maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nOption B suggests that a securitizing actor can argue for an issue to be securitized when it's outside of the political domain. It also mentions that securitization refers to recognizing a threat before it emerges in the political process. Hmm, this seems interesting. Securitization does involve identifying a threat and elevating it to a security issue, potentially before it becomes a part of public debate. But is this the complete picture? I think securitization can also involve issues that are already politicized. Maybe this option is too narrow.\n\nOption C states that securitization is the movement of issues from a politicized state to a heightened state of politics beyond the normal political domain of decision-making activities. Once it's securitized, it can't be returned to the public sphere and is translated into a state interest above normal proceedings. This sounds more in line with what I understand about securitization. It emphasizes that securitization elevates issues beyond normal politics, and they can't be easily depoliticized afterward. This seems plausible.\n\nOption D explains that an issue can be securitized when it's framed as a security question and moved from the politicized to the securitized sphere. It also mentions that during the securitization process, the securitizing actor(s) use discourse to persuade an audience that the issue is urgent and poses an existential threat to some referent object. This seems very comprehensive. It captures the essence of securitization as a discursive process where actors try to convince others that an issue is so critical that it requires exceptional measures.\n\nComparing these options, I think Option D is the most accurate and complete explanation of how securitization is completed. It outlines the process clearly, emphasizing the role of discourse and persuasion in framing an issue as a security threat.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any truth in the other options.\n\nOption A seems to confuse securitization with politicization. Securitization is about moving an issue from politics into security, not the other way around.\n\nOption B touches on a aspect of securitization by mentioning recognizing threats early, but it doesn't fully capture the process of framing and elevating the issue through discourse.\n\nOption C is close, but it suggests that once an issue is securitized, it cannot be returned to the public sphere. While it's true that securitization can make issues less open to debate, it's not necessarily irreversible. There can be processes of desecuritization where issues are brought back into normal political channels.\n\nGiven this, Option D still seems the best choice. It accurately describes the process of securitization as involving discourse and persuasion to frame an issue as a security threat, thereby moving it from the politicized to the securitized sphere.\n\nSo, my answer is D. An issue can be securitized, that is framed as a security question, when it is moved from the politicized to the securitized sphere. During the securitization process, the securitizing actor(s) use discourse to persuade an audience that the issue at hand is one of urgency and priority, and that it presents an existential threat to some referent object.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
