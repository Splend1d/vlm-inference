                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about two electrically charged balls. They're separated by a short distance and there's a force between them of 50 microNewtons. Then, keeping the charge of each ball the same, the mass of one of the balls is doubled, but not the other. I need to find out what the new electric force between the balls is.\n\nFirst off, I know that electric forces between charged objects are governed by Coulomb's law. Coulomb's law says that the force between two point charges is proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The formula is:\n\n\\[F = k \\times \\frac{q_1 \\times q_2}{r^2}\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(F\\) is the force between the charges,\n\n- \\(k\\) is Coulomb's constant,\n\n- \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\) are the magnitudes of the charges,\n\n- \\(r\\) is the distance between the centers of the charges.\n\nIn this problem, the charges \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\) are staying the same, and the distance \\(r\\) is also staying the same. The only thing that's changing is the mass of one of the balls. But wait a minute, Coulomb's law involves charges and distance, but not mass. So, if the charges and the distance aren't changing, should the force change at all?\n\nLet me think about this again. The problem says that the mass of one of the balls is doubled, but it specifies that the charge remains the same. So, in terms of Coulomb's law, none of the variables are changing: charges \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\) are constant, and distance \\(r\\) is constant. Therefore, the force \\(F\\) should remain the same.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something else going on here. For example, if the mass changes, could that affect the charge? Well, in reality, mass and charge are independent properties. Doubling the mass of an object doesn't change its electric charge, at least in the context of classical physics. So, the charge remains the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me by implying that mass and charge are related, but I don't think that's the case here. It seems pretty straightforward.\n\nLet me consider the units as well. Force is measured in Newtons, charge in Coulombs, distance in meters. Mass is measured in kilograms. Since mass isn't part of the formula for electric force, changing the mass shouldn't affect the force calculation.\n\nWait a second, maybe there's a gravitational force involved here as well, but the problem is specifically asking about the electric force. So, I think we can focus solely on Coulomb's law for this problem.\n\nSo, to summarize, the initial force is 50 \u03bcN, and since neither the charges nor the distance are changing, the force should remain 50 \u03bcN.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 50 \u03bcN\n\nB. 100 \u03bcN\n\nC. 200 \u03bcN\n\nD. 400 \u03bcN\n\nIt seems like option A is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me see if there's any possibility that the force could change. Maybe there's some other factor at play here that I'm not considering.\n\nFor example, if the mass of one ball is doubled, perhaps its inertia changes, but again, that shouldn't affect the electric force between the two charges.\n\nUnless there's some dependency between mass and electric charge that I'm not aware of, I don't think the mass change would affect the electric force.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the problem is trying to test understanding of inverse square laws or something similar, but again, since none of the variables in Coulomb's law are changing, the force shouldn't change.\n\nPerhaps the confusion comes from thinking about gravitational forces, where both mass and distance are factors. But in this case, we're dealing with electric forces between charged particles, so Coulomb's law applies.\n\nLet me check the problem again: \"Two electrically charged balls are separated by a short distance, producing a force of 50 \u03bcN between them. Keeping the charge of each ball the same, the mass of one of the balls but not the other is doubled. What is the new electric force between the balls?\"\n\nIt's clear: charges and distance remain the same, only mass changes. Since mass isn't a factor in Coulomb's law, the force should remain the same.\n\nI think I'm confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 50 \\ \\mu \\text{N}} \\]"
