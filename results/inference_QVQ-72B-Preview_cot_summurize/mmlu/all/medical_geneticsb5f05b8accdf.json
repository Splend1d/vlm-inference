I'm not super familiar with this topic, but I think I can work it out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a homeotic mutation is. I remember that mutations are changes in the DNA sequence, and they can affect how an organism develops or functions. Homeotic mutations sound like they might have something to do with development, maybe with how different parts of the body form during embryonic development.\n\nOption A says that a homeotic mutation is present in only one form in an individual. Hmm, that seems a bit vague. I think it's talking about whether the mutation is homozygous or heterozygous, but I'm not sure. Maybe if I skip this one for now and come back to it.\n\nOption B says that a homeotic mutation substitutes one body part for another in development. That sounds interesting. It makes me think of those famous fruit fly mutations where legs grow out of the head instead of antennae. Is that a thing? I think it's called antennapedia. If that's the case, then this option seems to be describing homeotic mutations pretty well.\n\nOption C says that a homeotic mutation results in the development of a tumor. Well, tumors are caused by mutations that affect cell growth and division, usually leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Homeotic mutations, from what I recall, are more about the placement and identity of body parts during development. So, I don't think this is correct.\n\nOption D says that a homeotic mutation is wild type at one temperature and abnormal at another. This sounds like it's describing a temperature-sensitive mutation. In some organisms, especially in research settings, mutations can be temperature-sensitive, meaning their phenotype changes depending on the temperature. But I don't think this is specifically what homeotic mutations are about. Maybe some homeotic mutations are temperature-sensitive, but that's not their defining characteristic.\n\nSo, between options A, B, and C, option B seems the most accurate based on what I know about homeotic mutations. They do seem to involve substituting one body part for another during development. Option A is a bit too vague, and option C is more related to cancer-causing mutations, not homeotic ones.\n\nLet me see if I can find some more information to confirm this. I recall that homeotic genes are part of the Hox gene family, which plays a crucial role in embryonic development, particularly in determining the identity of different body segments. So, if these genes are mutated, it could lead to one body part being replaced by another, like legs where antennae should be in fruit flies.\n\nYeah, that seems to align with option B. So, I think the correct answer is B: substitutes one body part for another in development.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if any of the other options could possibly be right.\n\nOption A: is present in only one form in an individual. This seems more related to genotype frequencies or something like that, not specifically to homeotic mutations. So, I don't think this is correct.\n\nOption C: results in development of a tumor. This is more related to oncogenic mutations, which are different from homeotic mutations. Homeotic mutations are more about the patterning and identity of body parts, not about uncontrolled cell growth.\n\nOption D: is wild type at one temperature and abnormal at another. This describes a temperature-sensitive mutation, which is a type of conditional mutation. While some homeotic mutations might be temperature-sensitive, this isn't the defining characteristic of homeotic mutations. Their primary characteristic is their effect on developmental patterning.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B: substitutes one body part for another in development.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
