                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out who gets the apartment building after all these people have passed away. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a widow who owns an apartment building outright, which is called \"fee simple\" ownership. That means she has complete ownership and can do pretty much whatever she wants with it, including leaving it to someone in her will.\n\nShe drafts a will and devises the apartment building to her granddaughter. Additionally, she leaves the residue, which is probably everything else she owns that isn't specifically mentioned in the will, to her friend and her assistant. So, the apartment building is a specific devise, and the rest goes to these two people.\n\nOne year later, the granddaughter dies intestate, meaning without a will, and she's survived by her son, who is her only heir at law. That means her son is the one who would inherit her estate since she didn't have a will specifying otherwise.\n\nNow, the jurisdiction where this is happening has a statute that says: \"If a devisee of a grandparent or lineal descendant of a grandparent dies at the time of execution of the will or fails to survive the testator, the issue of the deceased person shall take the decedent's share under the will.\"\n\nOkay, so this seems like an anti-lapse statute. Generally, a lapse occurs when a beneficiary named in a will dies before the testator, and their gift lapses, meaning it goes back to the residuary estate. But an anti-lapse statute prevents that from happening by allowing the deceased beneficiary's heirs to take the gift instead.\n\nIn this case, the granddaughter is the devisee of the apartment building, and she dies after the will is executed but before the testator (the widow) dies. So, according to the statute, since the granddaughter didn't survive the testator, her issue (her son) should take her share under the will.\n\nThe widow then dies, and her will is admitted to probate. Now, there's a dispute between the friend, the assistant, and the son over who gets the apartment building.\n\nThe question is whether the son is entitled to any share or interest in the apartment building.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because under the anti-lapse statute, the granddaughter's interest passes to her son.\n\nB. Yes, because rules relating to lapse of class gifts do not apply to specific devises.\n\nC. No, because intestate succession is inapplicable to devolution of title to specific devisees.\n\nD. No, because the granddaughter predeceased the widow, title to the apartment building passes to the friend and assistant under the residuary clause of the will.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an anti-lapse statute does. It seems clear that the statute is designed to prevent the gift from lapsing back to the residuary estate if the beneficiary dies before the testator. Instead, it passes to the beneficiary's heirs.\n\nIn this case, the granddaughter dies after the will is executed but before the testator dies. So, she didn't survive the testator, and she has an issue, which is her son. Therefore, according to the statute, her son should take her share under the will, which is the apartment building.\n\nOption A seems straightforward. But let's see about the other options.\n\nOption B says yes, because rules relating to lapse of class gifts do not apply to specific devises. I'm not entirely sure about this. \"Class gifts\" might refer to gifts to a class of people, like \"all my grandchildren,\" whereas here, it's a specific devise to one granddaughter. But in this scenario, it's a specific devise to one person, not a class.\n\nOption C says no, because intestate succession is inapplicable to devolution of title to specific devisees. Intestate succession is when someone dies without a will, and their estate passes according to state law. But in this case, the widow had a will, and the granddaughter also had a will, but she died intestate. However, the statute seems to override intestate succession in this context by specifying that the heir takes the deceased beneficiary's share under the will.\n\nOption D says no, because the granddaughter predeceased the widow, so the apartment building passes to the friend and assistant under the residuary clause. But that seems contrary to the anti-lapse statute. If the statute says that the heir takes the share, then it shouldn't pass to the residuary beneficiaries.\n\nSo, based on the statute, it seems that the son should get the apartment building. Therefore, options A and B suggest yes, while C and D suggest no. But between A and B, A seems more directly related to the statute provided.\n\nLet me think about this again. The statute says that if a devisee dies at the time of execution of the will or fails to survive the testator, the issue of the deceased person shall take the decedent's share under the will.\n\nIn this case, the granddaughter dies after the will is executed but before the testator dies, so she fails to survive the testator. Therefore, her issue, which is her son, should take her share.\n\nSo, the son is entitled to the apartment building.\n\nWait, but option B says yes, because rules relating to lapse of class gifts do not apply to specific devises. I'm not sure about that. Class gifts are different from specific devises. A class gift is to a group of people, like \"all my children,\" whereas a specific devise is to one specific person or property. So, maybe in this case, since it's a specific devise to one granddaughter, the rules about lapse don't apply in the same way.\n\nBut the statute seems to cover both scenarios. It says if the devisee dies at the time of execution or fails to survive the testator, the issue takes the share. So, regardless of whether it's a class gift or a specific devise, the statute applies.\n\nTherefore, the son should get the apartment building.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this. Maybe the residuary clause could somehow affect this. The residuary clause leaves everything else to the friend and the assistant. But the apartment building is specifically devised to the granddaughter, so it shouldn't be part of the residuary estate.\n\nUnless, of course, something happened to the devise, like if it failed for some reason. But the anti-lapse statute seems to prevent the devise from failing and passing to the residuary beneficiaries by allowing the heir to take the share.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A: Yes, because under the anti-lapse statute, the granddaughter's interest passes to her son.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
