                    "text": "So I have this problem here about a weak monoprotic acid. It says that a 0.060 molar solution of this acid has a pH of 2.0, and I need to find the ionization constant, Ka, for this acid. The options are A. 2.0 \u00d7 10^-3, B. 2.0 \u00d7 10^-1, C. 1.7 \u00d7 10^-1, and D. 5.0 \u00d7 10^-3.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a weak monoprotic acid is. A monoprotic acid is an acid that can donate one proton (H+) per molecule. For example, hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong monoprotic acid because it completely ionizes in water to give one H+ and one Cl-. However, since this is a weak acid, it doesn't ionize completely; only some of the molecules donate their H+ ions.\n\nThe ionization constant, Ka, is a measure of how much the acid ionizes in solution. The higher the Ka, the stronger the acid. For a weak monoprotic acid, the ionization can be represented by the equation:\n\nHA \u21cc H+ + A-\n\nWhere HA is the acid, H+ is the hydrogen ion, and A- is the conjugate base of the acid.\n\nThe Ka expression for this ionization is:\n\nKa = [H+][A-] / [HA]\n\nNow, if I can find the concentrations of [H+], [A-], and [HA], I can plug them into this equation to find Ka.\n\nI know the initial concentration of the acid is 0.060 M, and the pH is 2.0. The pH is a measure of the hydrogen ion concentration in the solution. The relationship is:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\nSo, if the pH is 2.0, then [H+] = 10^-2.0 = 0.01 M.\n\nSince the acid is weak, I can assume that the ionization is small, meaning that only a small fraction of the acid molecules have ionized. Therefore, the concentration of HA at equilibrium is approximately equal to the initial concentration minus the amount that ionized, which is [H+].\n\nSo, [HA] \u2248 0.060 M - 0.01 M = 0.050 M\n\nAnd [A-] is equal to [H+], because for every HA that ionizes, one H+ and one A- are produced. So, [A-] = 0.01 M\n\nNow, plugging these values into the Ka expression:\n\nKa = (0.01 M)(0.01 M) / (0.050 M) = (1.0 \u00d7 10^-4) / 0.050 M = 2.0 \u00d7 10^-3\n\nSo, the Ka should be 2.0 \u00d7 10^-3, which corresponds to option A.\n\nBut wait a minute, I should check if this approximation is valid. Because I assumed that [HA] is approximately 0.050 M, which is not too close to [H+]. If the ionization is significant compared to the initial concentration, this approximation might not hold.\n\nLet me try to solve this more accurately without making that approximation.\n\nThe ionization of HA can be represented as:\n\nHA \u21cc H+ + A-\n\nInitial concentrations: [HA] = 0.060 M, [H+] = 0, [A-] = 0\n\nAt equilibrium, let's say [HA] = 0.060 - x M, [H+] = x M, [A-] = x M\n\nWhere x is the degree of ionization.\n\nGiven that pH = 2.0, [H+] = 0.01 M, so x = 0.01 M\n\nTherefore, [HA] = 0.060 - 0.01 = 0.050 M\n\n[A-] = 0.01 M\n\nNow, Ka = [H+][A-] / [HA] = (0.01)(0.01) / 0.050 = 0.0002 / 0.050 = 0.004 = 2.0 \u00d7 10^-3\n\nSo, again, Ka = 2.0 \u00d7 10^-3, which is option A.\n\nBut let's see if this is consistent with the options provided. The options are:\n\nA. 2.0 \u00d7 10^-3\n\nB. 2.0 \u00d7 10^-1\n\nC. 1.7 \u00d7 10^-1\n\nD. 5.0 \u00d7 10^-3\n\nSo, according to this calculation, option A seems correct.\n\nHowever, I recall that for weak acids, sometimes the Ka can be expressed differently, or maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula that relates Ka to the initial concentration and the degree of ionization. But since I already have the [H+], this seems straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the Ka expression directly.\n\nKa = [H+][A-] / [HA]\n\nI know [H+] = 0.01 M, [A-] = 0.01 M, and [HA] = 0.050 M\n\nSo, Ka = (0.01)(0.01) / 0.050 = 0.0001 / 0.050 = 0.002 = 2.0 \u00d7 10^-3\n\nAgain, Ka = 2.0 \u00d7 10^-3, which is option A.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor that I might have missed. For example, maybe the autoionization of water contributes to the [H+]?\n\nAt 25\u00b0C, the autoionization of water is negligible compared to the ionization of a 0.060 M acid solution, especially since the pH is 2.0, which indicates a significant contribution from the acid.\n\nTherefore, the autoionization of water can be neglected in this calculation.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the acid is indeed weak or if it's strong. The problem states that it's a weak monoprotic acid, so I don't need to consider complete ionization.\n\nIf it were a strong acid, the Ka would be effectively infinite, or at least much larger than the values given in the options.\n\nAlso, I should confirm if the approximation [HA] \u2248 0.060 M - x is valid. Here, x = 0.01 M, so [HA] = 0.050 M. Since 0.01 M is not negligible compared to 0.060 M, the approximation might not be entirely accurate, but in this case, it's acceptable for the purposes of this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the Ka expression and solve for Ka directly without making any approximations.\n\nGiven that for a weak acid HA:\n\nKa = [H+]^2 / [HA]\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nActually, no. The correct expression is Ka = [H+][A-] / [HA], which is what I used earlier.\n\nBut in some texts, for very dilute solutions, they approximate [A-] \u2248 [H+], which is what I did.\n\nIn this problem, since [A-] = [H+] = 0.01 M, and [HA] = 0.050 M, plugging into the Ka expression gives Ka = (0.01)(0.01)/0.050 = 2.0 \u00d7 10^-3.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that [A-] \u2248 [H+], then Ka \u2248 [H+]^2 / [HA]\n\nSo, Ka \u2248 (0.01)^2 / 0.050 = 0.0001 / 0.050 = 0.002 = 2.0 \u00d7 10^-3\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is A. 2.0 \u00d7 10^-3.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect the Ka calculation.\n\nPerhaps the concentration of the acid is affecting the Ka value. But Ka is an equilibrium constant and should be independent of the initial concentration, provided that the acid remains weak.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pH isn't directly related to the [H+] concentration due to some other factors, but in standard conditions, pH is defined as -log[H+].\n\nTherefore, I don't think there's any other factor that would change this calculation.\n\nSo, the final answer is A. 2.0 \u00d7 10^-3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
