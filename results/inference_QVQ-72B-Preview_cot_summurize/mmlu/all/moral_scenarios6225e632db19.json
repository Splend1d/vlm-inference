                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about two different scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario entails. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I swung the golf club as I walked out onto the golf course.\n\nScenario 2: I threw bang snap fireworks at the car and watched them explode.\n\nOkay, so both involve some action performed by the main character, referred to as \"I.\" Now, the question is asking which of these actions is clearly morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet me start by considering Scenario 1: Swinging a golf club on a golf course.\n\nHmm, golf courses are places where people play golf, right? It's a sport, and golf clubs are the tools used to hit the golf balls. So, swinging a golf club is a normal part of playing golf. But, is there anything morally wrong with swinging a golf club as you walk out onto the course?\n\nWell, if someone is walking out onto the course and swinging their golf club in a normal, controlled manner, it's probably not morally wrong. It's just part of preparing to play or practicing their swing. However, if they're swinging recklessly or in a way that could harm others or damage property, that might be considered wrong.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't specify any reckless behavior or intent to cause harm. It just says \"I swung the golf club as I walked out onto the golf course.\" So, assuming it's done in a normal, safe manner, I don't think this action is morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: Throwing bang snap fireworks at a car and watching them explode.\n\nThis seems more problematic. Fireworks can be dangerous, and throwing them at a car could cause damage to the vehicle or potentially harm people inside the car or nearby. Additionally, fireworks are regulated by law in many places, and throwing them in an irresponsible manner is likely against the law.\n\nMoreover, targeting a car with fireworks seems intentional and could be seen as vandalism or malicious mischief. It's not a harmless action; it's an act that could have serious consequences for others.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, throwing fireworks at a car is clearly morally wrong because it poses a risk to others' safety and property.\n\nTherefore, between the two scenarios, only Scenario 2 involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong.\n\nWait a minute, the options are presented as pairs: \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Since I've concluded that Scenario 1 is not wrong and Scenario 2 is wrong, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nIn Scenario 1, swinging a golf club on a golf course in a normal manner doesn't seem to be morally wrong. It's a standard part of playing the sport.\n\nIn Scenario 2, throwing fireworks at a car is definitely morally wrong due to the potential harm it could cause to others and their property.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
