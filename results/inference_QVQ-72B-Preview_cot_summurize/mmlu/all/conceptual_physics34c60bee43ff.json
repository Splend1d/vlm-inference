                    "text": "Let's see. I remember that decibels are a way to measure sound intensity, and they use a logarithmic scale. So, a higher decibel level means a higher intensity, but not linearly higher. There's a formula to relate decibels to intensity.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{decibels (dB)} = 10 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{\\text{intensity}}{\\text{reference intensity}} \\right) \\]\n\nI think the reference intensity is usually \\(1 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\text{W/m}^2\\), but I'm not sure. For this problem, maybe I don't need to know that specifically.\n\nI have two sound levels: 60 dB and 80 dB. I need to find out how many times greater the intensity is at 80 dB compared to 60 dB.\n\nLet's denote the intensity at 60 dB as \\(I_1\\) and at 80 dB as \\(I_2\\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ 60 = 10 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{I_1}{I_0} \\right) \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ 80 = 10 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{I_2}{I_0} \\right) \\]\n\nWhere \\(I_0\\) is the reference intensity.\n\nFirst, I can solve for \\(I_1\\) and \\(I_2\\).\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n\\[ 6 = \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{I_1}{I_0} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{I_1}{I_0} = 10^6 \\]\n\n\\[ I_1 = I_0 \\times 10^6 \\]\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\n\\[ 8 = \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{I_2}{I_0} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{I_2}{I_0} = 10^8 \\]\n\n\\[ I_2 = I_0 \\times 10^8 \\]\n\nNow, to find how many times greater \\(I_2\\) is compared to \\(I_1\\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{I_2}{I_1} = \\frac{I_0 \\times 10^8}{I_0 \\times 10^6} = \\frac{10^8}{10^6} = 10^{8-6} = 10^2 = 100 \\]\n\nSo, the intensity at 80 dB is 100 times greater than at 60 dB.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to do this, maybe without finding the actual intensities.\n\nI know that the decibel scale is logarithmic, and each 10 dB increase corresponds to a tenfold increase in intensity.\n\nSo, from 60 dB to 80 dB, there's a 20 dB increase.\n\nSince each 10 dB corresponds to a factor of 10 in intensity, 20 dB would correspond to a factor of 10 twice, which is 100.\n\nSo, again, I get that 80 dB is 100 times more intense than 60 dB.\n\nLet me see if I can generalize this.\n\nIf two sound levels differ by \\(d\\) decibels, what is the factor by which the intensity changes?\n\nFrom the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{dB difference} = 10 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{I_2}{I_1} \\right) \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\frac{I_2}{I_1} = 10^{\\frac{\\text{dB difference}}{10}} \\]\n\nIn this problem, the dB difference is 80 - 60 = 20 dB.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\frac{I_2}{I_1} = 10^{\\frac{20}{10}} = 10^2 = 100 \\]\n\nWhich confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, since 20 dB is equivalent to a hundredfold increase in intensity (because 20 dB is 2 times 10 dB, and each 10 dB is a factor of 10, so 10*10=100).\n\nTherefore, the intensity at 80 dB is 100 times greater than at 60 dB.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 10 times greater\n\nB. 100 times greater\n\nC. 1000 times greater\n\nD. more than 1000 times greater\n\nThe correct answer is B. 100 times greater.\n\nI think that's solid. No need to consider the reference intensity because it cancels out in the ratio.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
