                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that a 2.35-gram sample was dissolved in water, and then chloride ions were precipitated by adding silver nitrate. The reaction is Ag+ + Cl- \u2192 AgCl, and they obtained 0.435 grams of precipitate. I need to find the percentage of chlorine in the sample.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. When you add silver nitrate to the solution, the silver ions react with chloride ions to form silver chloride (AgCl), which precipitates out of the solution. So, the mass of the precipitate, which is 0.435 grams, should be pure silver chloride.\n\nNow, to find the percentage of chlorine in the original sample, I need to determine how much chlorine was present in the sample and then divide that by the total mass of the sample, multiplied by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nBut wait, the sample isn't purely chlorine; it's a compound that contains chlorine. So, I need to figure out how much chlorine was in the sample based on the amount of chloride ions that reacted to form AgCl.\n\nSince every chloride ion reacts with one silver ion to form one AgCl molecule, the number of moles of Cl- ions in the sample should be equal to the number of moles of AgCl precipitated.\n\nSo, if I can find the number of moles of AgCl formed, which is 0.435 grams, and then find the mass of chlorine in that amount of AgCl, I can relate that back to the original sample.\n\nFirst, I need to find the molar mass of AgCl. I know that silver (Ag) has an atomic mass of approximately 107.87 g/mol, and chlorine (Cl) has an atomic mass of approximately 35.45 g/mol.\n\nSo, the molar mass of AgCl is 107.87 + 35.45 = 143.32 g/mol.\n\nNow, if I have 0.435 grams of AgCl, I can find the number of moles of AgCl:\n\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass = 0.435 g / 143.32 g/mol \u2248 0.00303 moles.\n\nSince each mole of AgCl contains one mole of Cl-, there are 0.00303 moles of Cl- in the sample.\n\nNow, I need to find the mass of chlorine in 0.00303 moles.\n\nMass of chlorine = moles \u00d7 molar mass of Cl = 0.00303 mol \u00d7 35.45 g/mol \u2248 0.107 grams.\n\nSo, the original sample contains 0.107 grams of chlorine.\n\nThe total mass of the sample is 2.35 grams.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of chlorine in the sample is (0.107 g / 2.35 g) \u00d7 100% \u2248 4.55%.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 10.80%\n\nB. 4.60%\n\nC. 43.50%\n\nD. 18%\n\n4.55% is closest to option B. 4.60%.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, molar mass of AgCl:\n\nAg: 107.87 g/mol\n\nCl: 35.45 g/mol\n\nTotal: 143.32 g/mol. That seems correct.\n\nNumber of moles of AgCl: 0.435 g / 143.32 g/mol \u2248 0.00303 moles. That looks right.\n\nSince the reaction is 1:1, moles of Cl- are also 0.00303 moles.\n\nMass of Cl: 0.00303 mol \u00d7 35.45 g/mol \u2248 0.107 g.\n\nPercentage: (0.107 / 2.35) \u00d7 100% \u2248 4.55%. Yes, that matches option B.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
