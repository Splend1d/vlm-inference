                    "text": "So I have this problem here: Dani has 45 marbles, and she has 5 times as many marbles as Joe has. I need to figure out how many marbles Joe has. The options are 50, 40, 9, or 5.\n\nAlright, let's see. It says Dani has 5 times as many marbles as Joe. So, if I let the number of marbles Joe has be represented by J, then Dani has 5J marbles.\n\nGiven that Dani has 45 marbles, I can set up the equation: 5J = 45.\n\nNow, to find J, I need to solve for J in this equation. To isolate J, I should divide both sides of the equation by 5.\n\nSo, J = 45 / 5.\n\nLet me calculate that: 45 divided by 5 is 9.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Maybe I can use another approach to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of proportions. If Dani has 5 times as many marbles as Joe, then the ratio of Dani's marbles to Joe's marbles is 5:1.\n\nSo, for every 5 marbles Dani has, Joe has 1 marble.\n\nGiven that Dani has 45 marbles, I can divide 45 by 5 to find out how many groups of 5 are there, which should give me the number of marbles Joe has.\n\nSo, 45 \u00f7 5 = 9.\n\nAgain, that gives me J = 9.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using multiplication to verify.\n\nIf Joe has 9 marbles, and Dani has 5 times as many, then 5 \u00d7 9 should be equal to 45.\n\nIndeed, 5 \u00d7 9 = 45.\n\nThat matches the given information, so it seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if there's any trick here. Is there any possibility that the relationship isn't exactly as stated, or is there any other factor involved?\n\nThe problem says, \"She has 5 times as many marbles as Joe has.\" It seems straightforward. There doesn't appear to be any other condition attached to this statement.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, J = 9 seems to be the answer.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 50\n\nB. 40\n\nC. 9\n\nD. 5\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. 9.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider why the other options might be incorrect.\n\nOption A: 50. If Joe had 50 marbles, then 5 times that would be 250, but Dani only has 45 marbles. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nOption B: 40. If Joe had 40 marbles, then 5 times that would be 200, which is more than Dani's 45 marbles. So, that's not correct.\n\nOption D: 5. If Joe had 5 marbles, then 5 times that would be 25, which is less than Dani's 45 marbles. So, that doesn't fit either.\n\nHence, the only possible correct answer is C. 9.\n\nI think that's it. I've checked it multiple ways, and it all adds up.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
