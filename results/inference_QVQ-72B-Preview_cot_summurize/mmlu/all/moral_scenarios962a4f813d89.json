                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I wanted to buy a doll so I broke open my piggy bank.\" Okay, so someone wants a doll and decides to use their savings from their piggy bank to buy it. Breaking open a piggy bank usually means accessing the money inside, which is typically saved for future use. Is there anything morally wrong with this? Well, it depends on whose piggy bank it is and how the money was intended to be used.\n\nIf the piggy bank belongs to the person and they saved the money for themselves, then using it to buy a doll seems fine. It's their money, and they can spend it on whatever they want. However, if the piggy bank contains money that was saved for a specific purpose, like college or something else, and the person spends it on a doll instead, that might be considered irresponsible or morally questionable.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't specify whose piggy bank it is or what the money was intended for. Assuming it's the person's own piggy bank and their own savings, breaking it open to buy a doll doesn't seem morally wrong. It's their money, and they have the right to decide how to spend it.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"I wipe the soap out of the tub because my grandma could slip when she steps into it.\" Here, someone is cleaning the bathtub by wiping off the soap residue to prevent their grandma from slipping. This seems like a considerate and careful action, aimed at ensuring their grandma's safety.\n\nSlipping in the bathtub can be dangerous, especially for older people who might have balance issues or bone fragility. By wiping the soap out, the person is reducing the risk of an accident. This action shows thoughtfulness and care for their grandma's well-being.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, this action is not only not wrong, but actually praiseworthy. It demonstrates responsibility and concern for others.\n\nTherefore, in both scenarios, the actions don't seem to be morally wrong. The first scenario involves using one's own savings to buy a desired item, which is generally acceptable. The second scenario involves taking preventive measures to ensure a loved one's safety, which is morally commendable.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI think the correct answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider if there's any other perspective that might categorize these actions as wrong.\n\nIn some cultural contexts, perhaps breaking open a piggy bank could be seen as wasteful or impulsive, especially if the item being purchased isn't essential. However, in general US culture, using one's own savings for personal desires is accepted, especially if it's a child saving for a toy.\n\nAs for the second scenario, it's hard to see how preventing a potential accident could be considered morally wrong. Unless there's some unusual circumstance, which isn't mentioned here, this action seems clearly morally right.\n\nSo, after considering both scenarios carefully, I'm confident that neither action is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
