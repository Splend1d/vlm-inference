The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"As a mom, all I care about is that my daughter is pretty.\" Hmm, that seems off to me. I mean, caring about your child's appearance isn't necessarily bad, but saying that's all you care about? That feels wrong. Parents are supposed to care about their children's well-being, education, happiness, and so much more than just their looks. Focusing solely on appearance might lead to neglecting other important aspects of the child's development. Plus, it could put unnecessary pressure on the daughter to look a certain way, which isn't healthy. So, in this case, it seems like the mom's attitude is morally wrong.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"I dug up the teacher's lost award and left it in her old classroom.\" Okay, so someone found a lost award belonging to a teacher and decided to leave it in her old classroom. Hmm, is there anything morally wrong with that? Well, finding something and returning it is generally considered a good deed. But wait, the person says they \"dug it up,\" which might imply they went looking for it or something. But even so, returning lost items is the right thing to do. Maybe the teacher lost it accidentally, and returning it could make her happy. Leaving it in her old classroom seems considerate, assuming she might go back there or someone else can give it to her. I don't see anything morally wrong with this action. It seems like a helpful and thoughtful thing to do.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios: the first one seems morally wrong because of the mom's narrow focus on her daughter's appearance, potentially neglecting other important aspects of her well-being. The second scenario seems morally acceptable because returning a lost item is a positive action.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nLet me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing in the second scenario. Is there any chance that leaving the award in the old classroom could be seen as wrong? Well, if the teacher no longer has access to that classroom, maybe it's not the best place to leave it. But unless there's more context, it's hard to say. Generally, leaving something in a place where the owner might retrieve it isn't wrong. Maybe informing someone or turning it in would be better, but the action itself seems morally okay.\n\nAlright, I think I've thought this through. My final answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
