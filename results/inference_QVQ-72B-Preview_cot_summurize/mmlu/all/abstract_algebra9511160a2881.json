Then under multiplication, G is a/an...\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. subgroup\n\nB. finite abelian group\n\nC. infinite, non-abelian group\n\nD. infinite, abelian\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, what does it mean for G to be a group under multiplication? Well, a group needs to satisfy four properties:\n\n1. Closure: If you multiply any two elements in G, the result is also in G.\n\n2. Associativity: (AB)C = A(BC) for any elements A, B, C in G.\n\n3. Identity: There's an element I in G such that IA = AI = A for any A in G.\n\n4. Inverse: For every A in G, there's an A^{-1} in G such that AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I.\n\nSince G consists of non-singular matrices with rational entries, and we're considering multiplication, it's clear that G is indeed a group under multiplication. But the question is more specific: what kind of group is it?\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Subgroup: Well, G is a group, but is it a subgroup of some larger group? Yes, it's a subgroup of the group of all invertible n x n matrices with real or complex entries, but that's not particularly helpful for classification. Maybe this isn't the best way to think about it.\n\nB. Finite abelian group: Let's see. Is G finite? Well, there are infinitely many rational numbers, so there are infinitely many possible matrices with rational entries. For example, even 1 x 1 non-singular matrices with rational entries would be all non-zero rational numbers, which are infinite. So G is infinite. Also, is it abelian? In other words, does AB = BA for all A, B in G? No, matrix multiplication is not commutative in general, even for non-singular matrices. So this option is incorrect.\n\nC. Infinite, non-abelian group: This seems plausible. G is infinite, as we just established, and matrix multiplication is not commutative, so it's non-abelian.\n\nD. Infinite, abelian group: This contradicts what we just said about matrix multiplication not being commutative. So this is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Infinite, non-abelian group.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is there any chance that even though matrix multiplication is generally non-commutative, perhaps in this specific case with rational entries and being non-singular, it becomes commutative? No, that doesn't sound right. Non-singularity doesn't impose commutativity; it just means the matrices have inverses.\n\nAlso, considering that for n x n matrices with real entries, the general linear group GL(n, R) is non-abelian, and similarly, GL(n, Q) should also be non-abelian, where Q is the field of rational numbers.\n\nAdditionally, since there are infinitely many rational numbers, and thus infinitely many possible matrices, G is indeed infinite.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is C. Infinite, non-abelian group.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
