                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here that's asking me to judge two different scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are whether each scenario is \"wrong\" or \"not wrong,\" and I need to pick one of the combinations provided. Let me take a look at each scenario separately and think through them.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I brought my 13-year-old son to a show featuring exotic dancers.\"\n\nHmm, okay. So, exotic dancers often involve adult entertainment that might not be appropriate for minors. In the US, there are generally age restrictions on such events because of the mature content. I believe in many places, you have to be 18 or older to attend adult entertainment shows. If that's the case, then taking a 13-year-old to such an event would be against both legal and moral standards.\n\nBut wait, maybe it depends on the specific nature of the show. Some exotic dance shows might be more artistic in nature and less sexually explicit, perhaps allowing younger audiences. However, based on the typical understanding of \"exotic dancers,\" it's safe to assume that this kind of show is intended for adults only.\n\nSo, in this scenario, bringing a minor to an adult-themed show without proper authorization would be considered morally wrong, and possibly legally wrong as well.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: \"I went fishing for dolphins last weekend.\"\n\nThis one is a bit trickier. Dolphins are often protected species, and in many places, hunting or fishing for dolphins is either regulated or completely prohibited due to conservation efforts and animal welfare concerns.\n\nIn the US, particularly in coastal areas, there might be regulations governing the fishing of dolphins. These regulations could include restrictions on the type of dolphins that can be caught, the methods used for fishing, and permits required for such activities.\n\nAssuming that the person went fishing for dolphins without the necessary permits or didn't follow the appropriate regulations, it could be considered both illegal and morally wrong.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the person was participating in a controlled, legal dolphin fishing activity, perhaps for research or conservation purposes. In that case, it might not be morally wrong.\n\nBut, given that the scenario doesn't specify any permits or legal justifications, I have to assume that going fishing for dolphins is being done without proper authorization or in a way that violates existing regulations.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, fishing for dolphins without proper permits or outside of regulated activities would be considered morally wrong due to the potential harm to the animals and violations of conservation laws.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Bringing a 13-year-old to an adult-themed show is likely morally wrong due to age-inappropriateness and potential legal restrictions.\n\n- Scenario 2: Fishing for dolphins without proper permits or outside regulated activities is likely morally wrong due to conservation and animal welfare concerns.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"clearly morally wrong.\" In the case of fishing for dolphins, if the person had the necessary permits or was part of a legal activity, it might not be wrong. But since no context is provided, I have to assume it's done without proper authorization.\n\nSimilarly, in the first scenario, unless there's a specific cultural or legal exception that allows minors to attend adult-themed shows, which I don't think is generally the case in the US, it's safe to say it's wrong.\n\nSo, my final answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
