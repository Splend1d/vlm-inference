                    "text": "So I have this question about inductors and the voltage they induce. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it. The options are:\n\nA. Product of its inductance and current through it.\n\nB. Ratio of its inductance to current through it.\n\nC. Ratio of current through it to its inductance.\n\nD. Product of its inductance and rate of change of current through it.\n\nHmm, I remember that inductors oppose changes in current, right? So, when the current through an inductor changes, a voltage is induced that tries to keep the current at its previous value. That makes sense intuitively, but what's the formula for that?\n\nLet me think back to my physics class. Oh, yeah! There's a formula that relates voltage, inductance, and current. It's something like V equals L times dI over dt. Is that right? Let me verify that.\n\nSo, V is the voltage across the inductor, L is the inductance, and dI/dt is the rate of change of current through it. So, that would make it V = L * (\u0394I / \u0394t), where \u0394I over \u0394t is the change in current over time.\n\nWait, but in calculus, it's actually dI/dt, which is the derivative of current with respect to time, representing the instantaneous rate of change of current.\n\nSo, if V is equal to L times dI/dt, that means the voltage is proportional to the inductance and how quickly the current is changing.\n\nLet me see which option matches that. Option D says product of its inductance and rate of change of current through it. That sounds exactly like V = L * (dI/dt).\n\nLet me just double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: product of inductance and current through it. That would be V = L * I, which is actually the formula for the voltage across an inductor if it were a resistor, but no, inductors have voltage related to the change in current, not the current itself.\n\nOption B: ratio of inductance to current through it. That would be V = L / I. I don't recall that being relevant in this context. Maybe in some other scenario, but not for induced voltage in an inductor.\n\nOption C: ratio of current through it to its inductance. That would be V = I / L. Again, that doesn't ring a bell. It seems unrelated to the basic behavior of an inductor.\n\nSo, by process of elimination, option D seems to be the correct one.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider the units. The unit of voltage is volts (V), inductance is henries (H), and rate of change of current is amperes per second (A/s). So, H times A/s equals volts. Yeah, that checks out.\n\nAlso, thinking about practical examples, like a solenoid or a coil, when you switch the current on or off, you get a voltage spike, which is consistent with the idea that voltage is proportional to the rate of change of current.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. Option D is definitely the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
