His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nIn European industry, the mining industry as discussed in the passage grew in importance following the invention of\n\nA. the water frame\nB. the spinning jenny\nC. the steam engine\nD. the internal combustion engine\n"

                    "text": "Alright, so I'm reading this passage from \u00c9mile Zola's \"Germinal,\" and it's about some social and economic issues in Russia and France, I think. There's talk about nihilists, national liberation, and workers' attitudes towards money and society. But the question at the end is about the mining industry in Europe and which invention made it grow in importance after a certain point.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of the passage. It seems like Souvarine is a character who is disappointed with the state of affairs in Russia and with the attitudes of his former comrades, the nihilists, who are focusing on political actions like killing the despot instead of working towards a more fundamental social change based on labor and fraternity.\n\nHe mentions his own experiences among workers, trying to foster a sense of community and common labor, but feeling that a true fusion hasn't happened. He criticizes the French workers for wanting to accumulate wealth for themselves, like the hatworkers who won a lottery and invested it to live without working, rather than using their resources to help the poor and build a better society.\n\nHis point is that as long as workers hold onto their possessions and dream of becoming bourgeois themselves, they won't achieve true happiness or social progress.\n\nNow, the question is about the mining industry in Europe and which invention led to its growth in importance following its invention.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. The water frame\n\nB. The spinning jenny\n\nC. The steam engine\n\nD. The internal combustion engine\n\nI need to recall what each of these inventions is and when they were developed to understand their impact on the mining industry.\n\nStarting with the water frame: I believe this is a type of spinning machine used in textile manufacturing, powered by water. It was invented in the 18th century, around 1764 by Richard Arkwright, and was important in the Industrial Revolution for textile production. But I don't recall it having a direct impact on mining.\n\nNext, the spinning jenny: This is another textile machine, invented by James Hargreaves in 1764, which allowed for multiple spools of thread to be spun at once. Again, this is more related to textiles than to mining.\n\nThe steam engine: This is a significant invention, developed in the 18th century by people like Thomas Newcomen and improved by James Watt. The steam engine was used to power pumps in mines to remove water, which was a major problem in deep mining. This allowed mines to go deeper and extract more minerals, which certainly increased the importance and productivity of the mining industry.\n\nThe internal combustion engine: This was developed later, in the 19th century, and is primarily associated with the automobile industry. While it has had widespread impacts, I don't think it directly influenced the mining industry in the same way that the steam engine did.\n\nGiven this background, it seems that the steam engine is the most relevant invention for the growth of the mining industry in Europe. It addressed a critical issue in mining\u2014water accumulation\u2014and enabled deeper and more efficient mining operations.\n\nSo, my answer would be C. The steam engine.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check the other options quickly.\n\nThe water frame and spinning jenny are both textile innovations and don't directly relate to mining. The internal combustion engine came later and isn't directly linked to mining's growth in the way the steam engine was.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. The steam engine.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
