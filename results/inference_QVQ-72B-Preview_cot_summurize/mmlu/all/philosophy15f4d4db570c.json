The question is: According to Hobbes, in the condition of man in which there is a state of war of everyone against everyone, every man has a right to...\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. some things\n\nB. lawful treatment\n\nC. due process\n\nD. everything\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I remember that Hobbes wrote \"Leviathan,\" where he talks about the state of nature and the social contract. The state of war he mentions is the state of nature where there's no government, and people are in a \"war of everyone against everyone.\"\n\nIn this state, what rights do individuals have? Well, Hobbes believed that in the state of nature, there is a right to everything. That means everyone has the right to do anything they want, including taking another person's life if they feel threatened or if it's in their self-interest.\n\nWait, but that sounds a bit extreme. Let me think again. Hobbes thought that without a common power to keep people in awe, they would live in constant fear of violence and death. So, in this state, everyone has the natural right to do whatever they think is necessary for their own self-preservation.\n\nSo, does that mean they have the right to \"everything\"? Well, in a way, yes. Because if self-preservation requires you to take someone else's life, steal their property, or lie to them, then according to Hobbes, you have the right to do so.\n\nBut hold on, the question is phrased as \"every man has a right to _____.\" And the options are:\n\nA. some things\n\nB. lawful treatment\n\nC. due process\n\nD. everything\n\nGiven that, option D seems the most fitting because in the state of nature, according to Hobbes, there are no laws, no government, and therefore no restrictions on what individuals can do to one another.\n\nWait, but maybe there are some natural laws or something that limit people's actions. Let me recall. Hobbes did talk about natural laws, but in the state of nature, these are more like moral guidelines rather than enforceable laws.\n\nHe said that the first law of nature is to seek peace when it can be obtained, and to follow one's own right to self-preservation. But again, in the absence of a sovereign power to enforce these, people are still in a state where they can act contrary to these laws without fear of punishment.\n\nSo, in that case, it still points towards everyone having the right to everything, meaning they can act without regard for others' rights or well-being.\n\nLet me consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: some things \u2013 that seems vague. If I choose this, it implies that there are limits to what people can do, but in the state of nature according to Hobbes, there are no such limits enforced.\n\nOption B: lawful treatment \u2013 but in the state of nature, there are no laws to speak of, so this doesn't make sense.\n\nOption C: due process \u2013 again, due process is a legal concept that requires a fair trial and other legal protections, which don't exist in the state of nature.\n\nTherefore, by elimination, option D seems correct: every man has the right to everything.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me think about Hobbes's actual writings. In \"Leviathan,\" he writes that in the state of nature, \"every man has a right to everything,\" meaning that there is no moral or legal restriction on actions.\n\nHe also famously says that life in this state is \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short,\" because everyone is against everyone, and there's constant fear and threat of violence.\n\nSo, based on that, it's clear that in Hobbes's view, in the state of war of everyone against everyone, every man has the right to everything.\n\nI think the answer is D. everything.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
