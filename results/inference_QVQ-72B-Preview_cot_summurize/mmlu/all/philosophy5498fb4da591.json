                    "text": "So I have this question here about Cicero, the ancient Roman philosopher and statesman. The question is asking, according to Cicero, it is expedient to be:\n\nA. just.\n\nB. generous.\n\nC. kind.\n\nD. all of the above.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what \"expedient\" means in this context. Expedient generally means advantageous or beneficial, often in a practical sense. So, the question is essentially asking, according to Cicero, it is advantageous to be just, generous, kind, or all of those things.\n\nNow, Cicero was a prominent figure in ancient Rome, known for his writings on philosophy, politics, and morality. He was deeply influenced by Greek philosophy, particularly Stoicism, which emphasized virtue, reason, and living in accordance with nature.\n\nLet me recall some of Cicero's teachings. He believed in the importance of virtue and moral integrity. In his work \"De Officiis\" (On Duties), Cicero discusses the relationship between moral right and expediency. He argues that true expediency aligns with what is morally right.\n\nSo, considering that, I would think that Cicero would consider it expedient to be just, generous, and kind, since these are virtues.\n\nBut let's think more carefully. Maybe not all of these are directly addressed by Cicero, or perhaps there's a nuanced difference in his perspective.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nFirst, being just. Justice is a fundamental virtue in Cicero's ethics. He believed that justice is the first virtue of citizens and that it forms the basis of a well-ordered society. In \"De Officiis,\" he writes about how justice requires us to give each person what is due to them. So, being just is not only morally right but also expedient, as it contributes to social harmony and personal reputation.\n\nNext, being generous. Generosity involves giving freely to others, often without expecting anything in return. Cicero would likely view generosity as a virtue because it shows concern for others and fosters goodwill. In his work \"On Friendship,\" he discusses the importance of generosity in building strong relationships. Therefore, being generous seems to align with expediency, as it can lead to reciprocal benefits and strengthen social bonds.\n\nThen, being kind. Kindness involves treating others with compassion and consideration. Cicero would have seen kindness as an essential aspect of human interaction. In \"De Officiis,\" he emphasizes the importance of kindness towards others, especially those who are vulnerable or in need. Kindness can improve one's reputation and relationships, making it expedient in the sense of being advantageous in the long run.\n\nGiven all this, it seems that Cicero would consider it expedient to be just, generous, and kind. Therefore, the answer should be D. all of the above.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe there's something I'm missing. Perhaps there's a specific context in Cicero's writings where he might prioritize one of these virtues over the others or see them differently in terms of expediency.\n\nLet me double-check. In \"De Officiis,\" Cicero does discuss the relationship between different virtues and how they sometimes can conflict. However, he generally maintains that virtues are interdependent and that living a virtuous life requires cultivating all of them.\n\nMoreover, he emphasizes that what is morally right is also what is truly expedient. So, if being just, generous, and kind are morally good, then they are also expedient.\n\nAnother point to consider is that Cicero was a pragmatist. He recognized the challenges of real-life situations and advocated for a balance between moral principles and practical considerations. However, he insisted that virtues should guide our actions, even when it seems inconvenient.\n\nTherefore, based on this understanding, it's safe to conclude that according to Cicero, it is expedient to be just, generous, and kind.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. all of the above.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
