The options are nuclear disarmament, d\u00e9tente, anticommunism, and international free trade. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that Reagan was the president in the 1980s, right? I think he was pretty focused on standing up to communism. Like, he called the Soviet Union an \"evil empire\" or something like that. So, that makes me think that anticommunism was a big part of his policy.\n\nBut let's think deeper. Nuclear disarmament\u2014that sounds like he wanted to reduce nuclear weapons. Did Reagan push for that early in his administration? I think later on, towards the end of his presidency, he and Gorbachev signed some treaties to reduce nuclear arms, like the INF Treaty. But was that early on?\n\nD\u00e9tente\u2014that's a term I've heard before. I think it refers to a period of improved relations between the US and the Soviet Union. Was that something Reagan emphasized early in his administration?\n\nAnticommunism seems to align with Reagan's rhetoric and actions. He was known for his hard-line approach against communism, supporting anti-communist movements around the world, like in Central America and Afghanistan.\n\nInternational free trade\u2014that's an interesting one. Reagan was a big believer in free markets and reducing trade barriers. He did work on trade agreements, but was that a primary focus of his early foreign and defense policies?\n\nLet me consider the context. His first term was from 1981 to 1985, during the Cold War. The Cold War was largely about containing communism, so it makes sense that Reagan would focus on anticommunism during that period.\n\nI recall that in the early 1980s, there was a lot of tension between the US and the Soviet Union. Reagan increased military spending significantly, which was part of his strategy to outpace the Soviets economically.\n\nAlso, he implemented the Reagan Doctrine, which supported anti-communist resistance movements globally. That sounds very much like anticommunism in action.\n\nNuclear disarmament, while important, seems to have come more towards the end of his presidency, especially with the Summit in Geneva in 1985 and the signing of the INF Treaty in 1987.\n\nD\u00e9tente was more associated with the Nixon and Carter administrations. Reagan initially took a more confrontational approach towards the Soviet Union, which might have led to increased tensions before eventually moving towards d\u00e9tente later in his presidency.\n\nAs for international free trade, while Reagan was a proponent of free markets, his early foreign and defense policies were more centered around countering communism.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the best answer is C. anticommunism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
