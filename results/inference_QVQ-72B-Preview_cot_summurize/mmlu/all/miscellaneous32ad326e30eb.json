                    "text": "So I've got this problem about depreciation. Let's see what it's asking. There's a farmer who buys a new tractor for $40,000, and he expects to use it for 20 years. After those 20 years, the tractor will have a salvage value of $10,000. I need to find out the straight-line depreciation for the first year of ownership. The options are A. 1500, B. 1667, C. 2000, and D. 2250.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what straight-line depreciation is. From what I remember, straight-line depreciation is a method of calculating depreciation where the cost of an asset is spread evenly over its useful life. So, it's basically taking the difference between the purchase price and the salvage value, and then dividing that by the number of years it's going to be used.\n\nSo, the tractor costs $40,000, and after 20 years, it will be worth $10,000. That means the total depreciation over 20 years is $40,000 minus $10,000, which is $30,000. Now, to find the annual depreciation, I should divide that total depreciation by the number of years, which is 20.\n\nLet me do that calculation: $30,000 divided by 20 years. Hmm, $30,000 divided by 20. Let's see, 30,000 divided by 10 is 3,000, but that's too easy. Wait, 30,000 divided by 20 should be 1,500. Yeah, that makes sense because half of 30,000 is 15,000, and 20 years divided by 2 is 10 years, so $1,500 per year.\n\nWait a minute, but one of the options is 1500, which seems correct, but let's double-check if there's any other factor I should consider. Is there any chance that the depreciation might be calculated differently in the first year? Sometimes, there's something called half-year convention or something, but the problem specifies straight-line depreciation for the first year of ownership, so I think it's just $1,500.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it. Maybe I can think about the formula for straight-line depreciation. The formula is:\n\nAnnual Depreciation = (Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life\n\nPlugging in the numbers: ($40,000 - $10,000) / 20 = $30,000 / 20 = $1,500 per year.\n\nYeah, that seems straightforward. I don't think there's any trick here that I'm missing. The question is pretty clear in stating that it's straight-line depreciation for the first year, so I don't need to worry about any accelerated methods or anything like that.\n\nLet me just make sure that I'm not confusing depreciation with other concepts like amortization or anything else. Depreciation is specifically for tangible assets like machinery or vehicles, which lose value over time due to use or obsolescence. In this case, it's a tractor, which fits that description.\n\nAlso, sometimes, there might be tax implications or other financial considerations that could affect depreciation, but the problem doesn't provide any additional information about that, so I think it's safe to assume that we're just dealing with the basic straight-line depreciation calculation.\n\nSo, based on all that, I'm confident that the correct answer is $1,500, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let's check if maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let's see, $40,000 minus $10,000 is indeed $30,000. Dividing that by 20 years gives $1,500 per year. Yeah, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the salvage value is being considered incorrectly. Maybe the tractor will be sold for $10,000 after 20 years, but perhaps the book value will be different, considering depreciation. But no, in straight-line depreciation, the book value at the end should be equal to the salvage value.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other aspect I might have missed. Perhaps the tractor has some residual value before the end of its life, but the problem states that the salvage value is $10,000 after 20 years, so I think that's the only value we need to consider.\n\nAnother thing to think about is whether the depreciation is being calculated on a monthly basis or annually. But the question specifies the first year of ownership, so I assume it's on an annual basis.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all possible angles here, and I still arrive at $1,500 as the annual depreciation. So, my final answer is option A. 1500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 1500} \\]"
