It says that in a team tug of war, Ty didn't pull as hard as he would have if he were pulling alone against one competitor. And I need to identify which of these options\u2014deindividuation, groupthink, social loafing, or bystander effect\u2014best describes his behavior.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with deindividuation: I think it's when people in a group lose their sense of individual identity and start behaving in ways they normally wouldn't if they were alone. Like, they might do things they wouldn't do individually because they feel anonymous in a crowd. But in this scenario, Ty is just not pulling as hard in a team tug of war. It doesn't seem like he's losing his individuality or doing something out of character.\n\nNext is groupthink. I believe this is when a group makes decisions without critically evaluating all the options because there's too much cohesion or pressure to conform. But in this case, it's just about Ty's effort in a physical activity, not about making a decision with a group. So, maybe not groupthink.\n\nThen there's social loafing. This sounds familiar; I think it's when people put in less effort in a group setting because they feel their individual contribution isn't as important or they can rely on others to pick up the slack. Hmm, that seems relevant to Ty's situation. He's in a team tug of war, so maybe he thinks his effort isn't as crucial since there are others pulling too.\n\nLastly, the bystander effect. I know this is about how people are less likely to help in an emergency when there are others around because they assume someone else will take action. Again, this doesn't seem directly related to Ty not pulling as hard in a tug of war.\n\nSo, comparing all these, social loafing seems to be the most fitting concept here. Ty is in a group setting, and he's not putting in as much effort as he would if he were alone because he's relying on his teammates to contribute.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something. Deindividuation is more about losing individual identity and behaving differently due to anonymity, which doesn't align with Ty's behavior. Groupthink is about decision-making in groups, which isn't applicable here. The bystander effect is about helping behavior in emergencies, which also doesn't fit.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. social loafing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
