The options are the Laws of Dharma, the Laws of Karma, the Laws of Vishnu, and the Laws of Manu. Hmm, I need to recall which one is the most famous and also dates back to around the first century.\n\nFirst off, Dharmashastra is a genre of Hindu texts that deal with Dharma, which can be translated as \"righteousness,\" \"religion,\" or \"law.\" These texts are important in understanding the social and religious norms of ancient India.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Laws of Dharma \u2013 This sounds generic and straightforward, but I don't recall it being a specific title of a text. Maybe it's a simplified name for one of the texts.\n\nB. Laws of Karma \u2013 Karma is a concept related to cause and effect, but I think it's more associated with individual actions and their consequences rather than a comprehensive set of laws governing society. So, maybe not the primary Dharmashastra.\n\nC. Laws of Vishnu \u2013 Vishnu is a major deity in Hinduism, known as the preserver. There is a text called the Vishnu Dharmashastra, which is an encyclopedic work on Hindu law and practice. But I'm not sure about its exact date.\n\nD. Laws of Manu \u2013 This one rings a bell. The Manusmriti, also known as the Laws of Manu, is a prominent Dharmashastra. It's a metrical work that covers a wide range of topics from caste system to the duties of rulers and individuals.\n\nI remember that the Manusmriti is one of the most well-known and influential Dharmashastras. It's often cited for its detailed rules on social classes, duties, and rituals. Now, regarding its date, I think it was composed sometime around the first century BCE or CE. Let me verify that.\n\nA quick search in my mind: the Manusmriti is generally dated to somewhere between 100 BCE and 300 CE. So, around the first century seems plausible. The exact date is a bit fuzzy, but that's close enough to consider it as \"around the first century.\"\n\nComparatively, the Vishnu Dharmashastra is also an important text, but I think it's slightly later, maybe around the 5th century CE. And the Laws of Dharma seems too vague; it might be a translation or a general reference rather than a specific text.\n\nThe Laws of Karma, while Karma is a central concept in Hinduism, I don't recall it being the title of a specific Dharmashastra. It might be more related to philosophical texts or Upanishads.\n\nTherefore, based on my knowledge, the Laws of Manu (Manusmriti) is the most famous Dharmashastra and is indeed probably from around the first century.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check. Yeah, the Manusmriti is consistently referred to as one of the most authoritative texts in the Dharmashastra tradition, and its composition period aligns with the given timeframe.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Laws of Manu.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
