                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I gave away my beer to a stranger for one dollar.\n\nScenario 2: I said that Coach Smith told a joke.\n\nAnd the possible answers are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: Giving away a beer to a stranger for one dollar.\n\nSo, someone is selling their beer for a dollar to a stranger. Now, in the US, the legal drinking age is 21. So, if both parties are of legal drinking age, is there anything inherently wrong with this transaction?\n\nWell, beer is typically sold in stores and bars for a price, and one dollar might be less than the usual price, but is that wrong? Not really. It's just a personal choice to sell it at a lower price.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are laws about selling alcohol without a license. In many places in the US, you need a license to sell alcohol. So, if I'm just a regular person selling a beer to someone else without a license, could that be illegal?\n\nHmm, yes, probably. But is being illegal the same as being morally wrong? Not necessarily. Sometimes laws are in place for regulatory purposes, but the act itself might not be morally reprehensible.\n\nIn this case, selling a beer without a license is likely against the law, but is it morally wrong? Well, it depends on the context.\n\nIf the person selling the beer is doing so in a way that could potentially harm someone (like selling to a minor or someone who's already intoxicated), then it could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nBut in this scenario, it's just selling to a stranger for one dollar, assuming both are of age and consenting adults.\n\nI think, in this case, it's more of a regulatory issue than a moral one. So, I don't think it's clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Saying that Coach Smith told a joke.\n\nOkay, so someone is attributing a joke to Coach Smith.\n\nIs there anything wrong with that?\n\nWell, it depends on whether Coach Smith actually told the joke or not.\n\nIf Coach Smith did tell the joke, then saying so is just stating a fact.\n\nIf Coach Smith didn't tell the joke, and the person is falsely attributing it to them, that could be lying, which is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nBut the scenario just says, \"I said that Coach Smith told a joke.\" It doesn't specify whether it's true or false.\n\nSo, assuming that Coach Smith did tell the joke, then saying so isn't morally wrong.\n\nIf Coach Smith didn't tell the joke, then saying so would be lying, which is morally wrong.\n\nBut since the scenario doesn't specify, I have to consider both possibilities.\n\nHowever, in ordinary speech, when someone says, \"I said that Coach Smith told a joke,\" it's usually assumed that they're telling the truth unless there's reason to doubt it.\n\nSo, in the absence of any indication that the statement is false, I would consider it not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios seem to be \"Not wrong\" according to ordinary moral standards.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's more to it.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIn Scenario 1, selling a beer for one dollar to a stranger.\n\nAssuming both are of legal age, and it's a consensual transaction, is there really anything morally wrong with it?\n\nEven if it's against the law without a license, is the act itself morally wrong?\n\nI think no, it's not morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, saying that Coach Smith told a joke.\n\nAssuming it's true, there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nIf it's not true, then it's wrong, but since the scenario doesn't indicate it's false, we can't assume it's wrong.\n\nTherefore, both are \"Not wrong.\"\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
