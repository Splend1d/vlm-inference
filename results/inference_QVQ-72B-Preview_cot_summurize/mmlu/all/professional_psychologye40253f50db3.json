The question is asking in which capacity a psychologist is most likely to face vicarious liability. The options are:\n\nA. Faculty member\n\nB. Supervisor\n\nC. Mentor\n\nD. Therapist\n\nFirst, I need to understand what vicarious liability means. From what I recall, vicarious liability is when one person is held responsible for the actions of another person. So, in a professional setting, it's about being liable for the actions of someone you supervise or are in a position of authority over.\n\nGiven that, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Faculty member: If a psychologist is a faculty member, say at a university, they might be teaching students or supervising research. Could they be held liable for the actions of their students? Maybe in certain cases, like if they supervised a student's research that had ethical violations.\n\nB. Supervisor: This seems straightforward. If a psychologist is supervising other professionals or trainees, they might be held responsible for the work those supervisees do. For example, if a supervisee makes a mistake in treatment that leads to harm, the supervisor could potentially be held liable if they were supposed to oversee and guide the supervisee's work.\n\nC. Mentor: Mentoring is often more advisory and less formal than supervision. While mentors can influence mentees, the relationship might not carry the same level of formal responsibility that supervision does. So, perhaps the liability isn't as direct as in a supervisory role.\n\nD. Therapist: As a therapist, the psychologist is directly providing treatment to clients. Any liability would likely be direct, meaning the therapist is responsible for their own actions, not necessarily for those of others.\n\nFrom this thinking, option B, supervisor, seems the most fitting for vicarious liability. Because supervision involves a direct oversight role, where the supervisor is expected to monitor and guide the work of the supervisee, they could be held liable for the supervisee's actions if they failed to provide adequate supervision.\n\nTo double-check, I remember that in many professions, including psychology, supervisors can be held responsible for the work of those they supervise, especially if the supervisee is still in training or not fully licensed. This makes sense because the supervisor is supposed to ensure that the work meets professional standards.\n\nIn contrast, being a faculty member or mentor might involve some level of influence or guidance, but it's generally not as directly oversight-based as supervision. And as a therapist, the direct responsibility is for one's own actions with clients, not for the actions of others.\n\nTherefore, I would say that B. Supervisor is the most likely capacity in which a psychologist would face vicarious liability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
