When the art collector described a painting by a well-known artist, the woman indicated she might like to buy that painting. The art collector said, \"I'll sell you the painting for $10,000. I'll give you 30 days to decide whether you want the painting. \" On March 25, the art collector wrote to the woman and stated that the offer of March 15 was withdrawn. The woman received the March 25 letter on March 26. On March 27, the woman wrote the art collector the following letter:\"Please be advised that I hereby accept your offer of March 15. \" The art collector received this letter on March28. Thereafter, the art collector and the woman engaged in several telephone discussions. On April 10, the woman, in a telephone conversation, told the art collector that she would pay $15,000 if the painting was delivered on or before April 15. The art collector agreed to deliver the painting for $15,000. On April 15, the art collector tendered the painting, but the woman refused to pay more than $10,000. If the art collector asserts a claim against the woman for breach of contract, which of the following is the most accurate statement?\n\nA. The art collector is obligated to sell the woman the painting for $10,000, because the woman, as offeree, had the right to accept the initial offer within the 30-day period.\nB.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this legal conundrum. So, we have an art collector who offered to sell a painting to a woman for $10,000, giving her 30 days to decide. Then, he withdrew the offer on March 25, which she received on March 26. But she sent a letter on March 27 accepting the original offer, which he received on March 28. Later, they had phone conversations where she offered $15,000 for the painting if delivered by April 15, and he agreed. But when he tendered the painting on April 15, she refused to pay more than $10,000.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the art collector can claim breach of contract against the woman, and which statement is the most accurate in that scenario.\n\nLet's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's the initial offer on March 15 for $10,000 with a 30-day decision period. Then, on March 25, the art collector withdrew the offer, which the woman received on March 26. She sent an acceptance on March 27, which he received on March 28.\n\nIn contract law, once an offer is revoked, any subsequent acceptance is\u65e0\u6548 because the offer is no longer valid. So, her acceptance on March 27 was after the offer was revoked on March 25, which means there was no valid contract formed at $10,000.\n\nThen, on April 10, they had a phone conversation where she offered $15,000 if the painting was delivered by April 15, and he agreed. This seems like a new offer and acceptance, forming a valid contract at $15,000.\n\nBut when he tendered the painting on April 15, she refused to pay more than $10,000.\n\nNow, the question is, if the art collector claims breach of contract, which statement is most accurate?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The art collector is obligated to sell the painting for $10,000 because the woman had the right to accept within the 30-day period.\n\nBut wait, the offer was revoked on March 25, and she accepted on March 27, which is after the revocation. So, her acceptance was\u65e0\u6548 because the offer was no longer open. Therefore, there was no contract at $10,000.\n\nB. Since the art collector, as offeror, had the power to revoke the original offer before acceptance, the woman is obligated under the terms of their April 10 agreement.\n\nThis seems plausible. The original offer was revoked, so any acceptance after that is\u65e0\u6548. Then, on April 10, she made a new offer of $15,000, which he accepted. So, they have a binding contract at $15,000.\n\nC. Since the parties entered into a subsequent modification, the woman is obligated to pay the art collector $15,000 for the painting.\n\nThis is similar to option B. It acknowledges that there was a modification of the original terms, leading to a new agreement at $15,000.\n\nD. An enforceable contract does not exist between the parties because of mutual mistake of fact.\n\nMutual mistake occurs when both parties share a common mistake about a material fact, which can render a contract voidable. But in this scenario, it's not clear what the mutual mistake is. They seem to have different understandings of the price, but that's not a mutual mistake; it's a disagreement on terms.\n\nSo, between options B and C, which is more accurate?\n\nOption B says that since the art collector could revoke the original offer, the woman is obligated under the April 10 agreement. Option C says that because they entered into a subsequent modification, she owes $15,000.\n\nBoth B and C point to the April 10 agreement as binding, but option C is more direct in stating that the modification created the obligation to pay $15,000.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the $10,000 offer was revoked before acceptance.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there doesn't seem to be a mutual mistake.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is C: Since the parties entered into a subsequent modification, the woman is obligated to pay the art collector $15,000 for the painting.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. In contract law, when one party makes an offer and the other accepts, a contract is formed on those terms. If a new offer is made and accepted, that supersedes any previous agreements.\n\nIn this case, the original offer was revoked, so her acceptance was\u65e0\u6548. Then, on April 10, she offered $15,000 for delivery by April 15, and he agreed. So, they have a valid contract at $15,000.\n\nTherefore, when he tendered the painting on April 15, she was obligated to pay $15,000, not $10,000.\n\nHer refusal to pay $15,000 would constitute a breach of contract.\n\nSo, the art collector can claim breach of contract based on the April 10 agreement at $15,000.\n\nTherefore, option C is the most accurate statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
