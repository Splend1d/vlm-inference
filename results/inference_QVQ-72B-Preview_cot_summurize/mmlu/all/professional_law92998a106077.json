Pursuant to a state statute governing medical care for indigents, the hospital notified county officials that it had in its hospital an indigent who might qualif' for county care and requested that the man be transferred to the county's public hospital facility. In accordance with the approved procedures, the private hospital claimed reimbursement from the county in the amount of $1,069 for the care and services it had provided. Under the relevant state statute:\"Individual county governments are charged with the mandatory duty of providing necessary hospital and medical care for their indigent sick. In order to qualif' for such hospital and medical care, an indigent shall be resident of the county for the preceding 12 months in order to be eligible for free non-emergency medical care. \"As a consequence, the county refused to admit the man to its public hospital or to reimburse the private hospital because the man had not been a resident of the county for the preceding year.

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about an indigent man who moved to a new state and then had a severe respiratory attack. He was taken to a private hospital, which then notified the county that he might qualify for county care. But the county said no because he hadn't lived in the county for the past 12 months, which is a requirement in the state statute for free non-emergency medical care for indigents.\n\nNow, there's a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of this residency requirement. The question is, what will the federal court most likely decide? Is this statute constitutional or unconstitutional?\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment says. It basically requires that states provide equal protection under the law to all people, without arbitrary discrimination.\n\nIn this case, the statute in question imposes a residency requirement for indigents to receive free medical care. Specifically, you have to have been a resident of the county for the preceding 12 months to qualify.\n\nSo, this residency requirement is creating a classification based on how long someone has lived in the county. That means some indigents get free medical care and others don't, based on their residency history.\n\nNow, when a law creates a classification like this, courts typically review it under one of three levels of scrutiny: rational basis review, intermediate scrutiny, or strict scrutiny.\n\nStrict scrutiny is for laws that affect fundamental rights or target suspect classes, like race or national origin. Intermediate scrutiny is for laws that discriminate based on gender or affect certain quasi-suspect classes.\n\nRational basis review is the most lenient and is applied when the law doesn't fall into any of those categories. Under rational basis review, the law is constitutional if it's rationally related to a legitimate government interest.\n\nIn this case, the classification is based on residency duration, which isn't a suspect or quasi-suspect classification, and it doesn't affect a fundamental right directly. So, it's likely that the court will apply rational basis review.\n\nBut wait, there's a twist. The Supreme Court has held that residency requirements can sometimes be subject to stricter scrutiny if they burden the right to travel, which is considered a fundamental right protected by the Constitution.\n\nSo, maybe this isn't just a straightforward rational basis review case.\n\nLet me look into that more.\n\nThe right to travel has been recognized by the Supreme Court as a fundamental right, derived from the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, Section 2, and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThere are different aspects to the right to travel:\n\n1. The right to enter another state.\n\n2. The right to be treated as a citizen of the state once there.\n\n3. The right to travel internationally.\n\nIn this scenario, we're dealing with the second aspect: how new residents are treated after they move to a state.\n\nThe state is requiring a 12-month residency before indigents can qualify for free medical care. This could be seen as penalizing new residents and favoring long-term residents, which might violate the Equal Protection Clause or the Privileges and Immunities Clause.\n\nThe Supreme Court has struck down residency requirements that unduly burden the right to travel, especially when they discriminate against new residents in accessing basic public services.\n\nFor example, in Shapiro v. Thompson (1969), the Court held that a one-year residency requirement for receiving welfare benefits violated the Equal Protection Clause because it impeded the right to travel.\n\nSimilarly, in Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County (1974), the Court struck down a 12-month residency requirement for free medical care for indigents, finding that it imposed an unconstitutional burden on the right to travel.\n\nSo, based on these precedents, it seems likely that a federal court would declare this statute unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nBut let me consider the other options.\n\nOption A says the statute is constitutional because it promotes a compelling state interest.\n\nFor a law to be constitutional under strict scrutiny, it must serve a compelling state interest and be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\n\nWhat might be the compelling state interest here?\n\nPerhaps the state is trying to prevent people from moving to the state just to get free medical care, which could be a burden on the state's resources.\n\nBut even so, the Supreme Court has said that such interests aren't compelling enough to justify residency requirements that burden the right to travel.\n\nIn Memorial Hospital, the Court rejected the argument that preventing migrants from coming to the state for welfare was a compelling state interest.\n\nSo, option A is probably incorrect.\n\nOption B says the statute is constitutional because it's a proper exercise of state action.\n\nWell, states have the power to regulate many aspects of their internal affairs, including providing public assistance.\n\nHowever, that power isn't absolute and must comply with the Constitution, including the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nGiven the Supreme Court's rulings on residency requirements, it's unlikely that this statute would be upheld as a proper exercise of state action.\n\nOption C says the statute is constitutional because it's within the state's police power to regulate the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.\n\nAgain, while states have police powers to regulate for the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens, these regulations must not violate constitutional rights.\n\nThe right to travel is a fundamental right, and imposing residency requirements that burden that right would likely be unconstitutional.\n\nOption D says the statute is unconstitutional because it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nBased on the Supreme Court's precedents, particularly Shapiro v. Thompson and Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County, this seems to be the most accurate statement.\n\nTherefore, the court will most likely declare the statute unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
