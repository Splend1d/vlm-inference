                    "text": "So I've got this logic problem here, and I need to translate a symbolic logic formula into English using the given key for the variables. The formula is (~A \u2228 ~B) \u2283 C, and the variables are:\n\nA: Marina reads a Percy Jackson book.\n\nB: Izzy plays Minecraft.\n\nC: Emily stops working.\n\nD: Russell makes dinner.\n\nE: Ashleigh stops by.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the formula (~A \u2228 ~B) \u2283 C means in English. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe symbol ~ means \"not,\" so ~A means \"not A,\" which translates to \"Marina does not read a Percy Jackson book.\" Similarly, ~B means \"Izzy does not play Minecraft.\"\n\nThe symbol \u2228 means \"or,\" so (~A \u2228 ~B) means \"Marina does not read a Percy Jackson book or Izzy does not play Minecraft.\"\n\nThe symbol \u2283 means \"implies\" or \"if...then,\" so (~A \u2228 ~B) \u2283 C means \"if Marina does not read a Percy Jackson book or Izzy does not play Minecraft, then Emily stops working.\"\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but I should make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nLet me recall the truth table for the implication operator. An implication P \u2283 Q is false only when P is true and Q is false; otherwise, it's true.\n\nSo, in this case, (~A \u2228 ~B) is the antecedent, and C is the consequent.\n\nNow, I need to look at the options provided and see which one correctly translates the formula.\n\nOption A says: If neither Marina reads a Percy Jackson book nor Izzy plays Minecraft, then Emily stops working.\n\nHmm, \"neither...nor\" corresponds to ~(A \u2228 B), which is not the same as ~A \u2228 ~B. ~A \u2228 ~B is equivalent to ~(A \u2227 B), but not ~(A \u2228 B). So, this option seems to be interpreting ~A \u2228 ~B as ~(A \u2228 B), which is not correct. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B says: If it's not the case that both Marina reads a Percy Jackson book and Izzy plays Minecraft, then Emily stops working.\n\nOkay, \"it's not the case that both A and B\" is the same as ~(A \u2227 B), which is equivalent to ~A \u2228 ~B due to De Morgan's laws. So, this option is correctly capturing the meaning of ~A \u2228 ~B. Therefore, option B seems to be correct.\n\nOption C says: Either Marina not reading a Percy Jackson book or Izzy not playing Minecraft entails that Emily stops working.\n\nThis is essentially stating (~A \u2228 ~B) \u2283 C, which matches the original formula. So, this also correctly translates the formula.\n\nOption D says: Emily stopping working is a sufficient condition for either Marina not reading a Percy Jackson book or Izzy not playing Minecraft.\n\nWait, this seems to be reversing the direction of the implication. The original formula is (~A \u2228 ~B) \u2283 C, but this option is saying C \u2283 (~A \u2228 ~B). That's the opposite direction. So, this is incorrect.\n\nSo far, options B and C seem to correctly translate the formula, while options A and D do not.\n\nBut the question is to choose all correct translations, and I think only one is supposed to be selected. Maybe I need to check again.\n\nLet me double-check option C. It says: Either Marina not reading a Percy Jackson book or Izzy not playing Minecraft entails that Emily stops working.\n\n\"Entails that\" is a bit vague, but in logic, \"P entails Q\" typically means P \u2283 Q. So, in this case, it's (~A \u2228 ~B) \u2283 C, which matches the original formula.\n\nOption B says: If it's not the case that both Marina reads a Percy Jackson book and Izzy plays Minecraft, then Emily stops working.\n\nThis is also (~A \u2228 ~B) \u2283 C.\n\nSo both B and C seem correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is to choose the best translation, or maybe there's a subtle difference I'm missing.\n\nLet me consider the structure again. The original formula is (~A \u2228 ~B) \u2283 C.\n\nOption B: If not both A and B, then C.\n\nOption C: Either not A or not B entails C.\n\nBoth seem logically equivalent, but perhaps one is more natural than the other.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing understanding of logical connectives and their English equivalents.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the logical equivalence.\n\n~A \u2228 ~B is equivalent to ~(A \u2227 B), which is \"not (A and B).\"\n\nSo, the implication (~A \u2228 ~B) \u2283 C can be rewritten as ~(A \u2227 B) \u2283 C.\n\nIn English, this is: If it is not the case that both A and B, then C.\n\nWhich matches option B.\n\nOption C says: Either not A or not B entails C.\n\nThis is also a correct interpretation of (~A \u2228 ~B) \u2283 C.\n\nBut perhaps the question is to choose the most straightforward translation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is to identify which option correctly captures the logical structure.\n\nWait, looking back at the options:\n\nOption A: If neither A nor B, then C.\n\nBut \"neither A nor B\" is ~(A \u2228 B), which is different from ~A \u2228 ~B.\n\nOption B: If not both A and B, then C.\n\nThis is ~(A \u2227 B) \u2283 C, which is equivalent to (~A \u2228 ~B) \u2283 C.\n\nOption C: Either ~A or ~B entails C.\n\nThis is directly (~A \u2228 ~B) \u2283 C.\n\nOption D: C is sufficient for ~A \u2228 ~B.\n\nThis is C \u2283 (~A \u2228 ~B), which is the converse of the original implication.\n\nTherefore, options B and C are correct translations, while A and D are not.\n\nBut the question says \"use the following key to translate the given formula of PL to natural, English sentences,\" and presents four options. It doesn't specify to choose one or multiple, but likely expects the selection of one best answer.\n\nGiven that both B and C are correct translations, perhaps the intended answer is B, as it uses more natural English constructs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects only one answer, so between B and C, which one is more appropriate.\n\nConsidering that, perhaps option B is the best answer because it directly translates the logical structure without using the term \"entails,\" which might be considered too formal or technical for a natural English sentence.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
