It says: \"In a _____________ attack, the extra data that holds some specific instructions in the memory for actions is projected by a cyber-criminal or penetration tester to crack the system.\"\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Phishing\n\nB. MiTM\n\nC. Buffer-overflow\n\nD. Clickjacking\n\nHmm, let's break this down. I need to understand what each of these attacks does and see which one fits the description.\n\nFirst, phishing. I know that phishing is when someone tries to trick me into giving them my login details or credit card information by pretending to be a trustworthy entity, like a bank or a popular website. So, it's more about social engineering and\u6b3a\u9a97\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u76f4\u63a5\u5411\u7cfb\u7edf\u6ce8\u5165\u6570\u636e\u6765\u7834\u574f\u5b83\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u3002\n\nNext, MiTM, which stands for Man-in-the-Middle attack. This is where an attacker intercepts communications between two parties to eavesdrop or possibly alter the data being sent. It's like someone listening in on your conversation or even changing what's being said. But again, this doesn't sound like injecting extra data with specific instructions into memory to crack a system.\n\nNow, buffer-overflow. I've heard of this one before. It's when a program tries to store more data in a buffer than it can handle, causing the extra data to overflow into adjacent memory locations. If a hacker can exploit this, they might be able to inject malicious code or manipulate the program's execution. This sounds a bit like the description in the question\u2014injecting extra data with specific instructions to crack the system.\n\nLastly, clickjacking. This is when a malicious site tricks me into clicking on something that I didn't intend to, maybe by overlaying invisible buttons over legitimate content. It's a way to make me perform actions against my will, like liking a post or sharing something on social media. Again, not quite fitting the description of injecting data with specific instructions into memory.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like a buffer-overflow attack is the one where extra data with specific instructions is injected into memory to crack the system.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it a bit more.\n\nPhishing is about\u9a97\u53d6\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0cMiTM\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u62e6\u622a\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u7be1\u6539\u901a\u4fe1\uff0cclickjacking\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u8bf1\u4f7f\u7528\u6237\u70b9\u51fb\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e0d\u5e94\u8be5\u70b9\u51fb\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u3002\u53ea\u6709\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u6ea2\u51fa\u653b\u51fb\u6d89\u53ca\u5230\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u989d\u5916\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6267\u884c\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6216\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5229\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u662fC.
