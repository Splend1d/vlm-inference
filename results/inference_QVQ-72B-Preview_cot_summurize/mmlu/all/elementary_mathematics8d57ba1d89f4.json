                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: there are 15 toucans and 60 parrots at a zoo, and I need to find the ratio of toucans to parrots. The options are 1:04, 1:05, 4:01, and 4:05. Hmm, ratios can be tricky, but I think I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio represents. A ratio compares two quantities by division. In this case, it's comparing the number of toucans to the number of parrots. So, it's toucans to parrots, which is 15 to 60.\n\nOne way to express a ratio is in its simplest form. To do that, I should divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD). Let's find the GCD of 15 and 60. The factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15. The factors of 60 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60. The common factors are 1, 3, 5, and 15. The greatest common factor is 15.\n\nSo, if I divide both numbers by 15, I get:\n\n15 \u00f7 15 = 1\n\n60 \u00f7 15 = 4\n\nTherefore, the simplified ratio is 1:4. That would be option A, 1:04.\n\nWait a minute, but I see option B is 1:05, which seems incorrect because according to my calculation, it should be 1:4. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check.\n\nStarting again: toucans are 15 and parrots are 60. Ratio is 15 to 60. Dividing both by 15 gives 1 to 4. Alternatively, I can write it as a fraction: 15/60, which simplifies to 1/4. So, yes, 1:4 is correct.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option A is 1:04, which is the same as 1:4, just with an extra zero. Option B is 1:05, which is different. So, perhaps the extra zero is just for formatting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is being expressed differently. Let me consider if there's another way to interpret the ratio.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the ratio in terms of decimals or something, but no, it's a simple ratio of whole numbers. Alternatively, perhaps they want the ratio in reverse, like parrots to toucans, but no, the question specifically asks for toucans to parrots.\n\nAnother thought: maybe they want the ratio in terms of parts per something, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nLooking back, I think the correct answer is A, 1:04, which is essentially 1:4.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to simplify the ratio. If I divide both numbers by 3, I get 5:20, which can be further simplified to 1:4. Dividing by 5 gives 3:12, which also simplifies to 1:4. So, again, 1:4 is the simplest form.\n\nI don't think there's any other simplification needed beyond that. Therefore, the ratio of toucans to parrots is 1:4, or 1:04 as per the options provided.\n\nWait, but option C is 4:01, which would be parrots to toucans, but the question asks for toucans to parrots. Option D is 4:05, which doesn't match either.\n\nSo, I conclude that option A, 1:04, is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
