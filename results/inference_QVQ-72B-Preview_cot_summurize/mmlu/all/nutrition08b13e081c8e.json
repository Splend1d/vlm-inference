Reduced gluconeogenesis\n\nD. Reduced proteolysis\n\nHmm, let's recall what insulin does. Insulin is a hormone that's released by the pancreas when we have high blood sugar levels. It helps to lower blood sugar by promoting the uptake of glucose into cells, like muscle and fat cells. So, in insulin deficiency, which is like in type 1 diabetes, there's not enough insulin to regulate blood sugar properly.\n\nNow, let's think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Reduced lipolysis. Lipolysis is the breakdown of fats into fatty acids and glycerol. Insulin is known to inhibit lipolysis. So, if there's less insulin, lipolysis should increase, not reduce. So, this option seems incorrect.\n\nOption B: Increased ketogenesis. Ketogenesis is the production of ketones, which happens when the body breaks down fats for energy, especially during times when carbohydrate intake is low or when there's insulin resistance. In insulin deficiency, since insulin isn't suppressing lipolysis effectively, more fatty acids are released into the bloodstream. This can lead to increased ketogenesis in the liver. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption C: Reduced gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis is the process where the liver makes glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, like amino acids and glycerol. In insulin deficiency, since insulin isn't suppressing gluconeogenesis, you'd expect it to increase, not decrease. So, this option is probably wrong.\n\nOption D: Reduced proteolysis. Proteolysis is the breakdown of proteins into amino acids. Insulin promotes protein synthesis and inhibits proteolysis. So, if insulin is deficient, proteolysis should increase, not reduce. So, this option is likely incorrect.\n\nPutting it all together, it seems that insulin deficiency is associated with increased ketogenesis. Let me double-check.\n\nIn insulin deficiency:\n\n- Lipolysis increases because insulin isn't inhibiting it.\n\n- Ketogenesis increases due to higher fatty acid levels.\n\n- Gluconeogenesis increases because insulin isn't suppressing it.\n\n- Proteolysis increases because insulin isn't inhibiting protein breakdown.\n\nSo, yes, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
