There's an investor who owns one lot with an office building, and a developer who owns the neighboring lot, also with an office building. The developer decides to demolish their existing building and build a taller one. They've got all the necessary government approvals for zoning and building, and there are no specific statutes or ordinances mentioned beyond those approvals.\n\nDuring the demolition and excavation process, the developer digs deeper into the ground, using shoring that meets all local, state, and federal safety regulations. Despite this, the investor notices cracks developing in their building and informs the developer. The developer argues that any subsidence in the investor's building is due to the weight of the building itself and that no subsidence would occur if the investor's land were in its natural state. The developer continues with the excavation, and ultimately, the investor's building suffers extensive damage, costing $750,000 to repair.\n\nNow, the question is about the investor's ability to recover damages from the developer. There are four options provided:\n\nA. The developer is liable because they removed necessary support for the investor's lot.\n\nB. The developer cannot be held liable solely on the proof that support was removed but may be held liable if negligence is proved.\n\nC. Once land is improved with a building, the owner cannot invoke the right of lateral support.\n\nD. The developer's only obligation was to satisfy all local, state, and federal safety regulations.\n\nI need to determine which of these comments is the best regarding the investor's action to recover damages.\n\nFirst, I should recall some basic principles of property law, particularly regarding lateral support. Lateral support refers to the natural support that one piece of land provides to adjacent land. Generally, landowners have a right to have their land supported by neighboring land in its natural state. However, when improvements like buildings are constructed, this can complicate things.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A states that the developer is liable because they removed necessary support for the investor's lot. This seems to align with the concept of lateral support. If the developer's actions in excavating caused damage to the investor's building by removing the support that the investor's building relied upon, then there might be liability there.\n\nHowever, I need to consider whether the right to lateral support applies when there's a building on the land. Option C suggests that once land is improved with a building, the owner cannot invoke the right of lateral support. If that's the case, then the investor might not have a claim based on lateral support.\n\nBut I think it's more nuanced than that. In many jurisdictions, while the right to lateral support is generally associated with land in its natural state, there can still be obligations not to cause subsidence or damage to adjacent buildings through one's actions.\n\nOption B mentions that the developer cannot be held liable solely on the proof that support was removed but may be held liable if negligence is proved. This implies that simply causing subsidence by removing support isn't automatically negligent or wrongful, and that there needs to be a showing of negligence.\n\nThis seems reasonable. The developer is taking steps to construct a building, which involves excavation and shoring. Even if done according to regulations, there's always a risk of some subsidence, especially in urban areas with closely packed buildings.\n\nThe key here is whether the developer acted reasonably, following applicable building codes and safety regulations. Since the shoring met all local, state, and federal safety regulations, it suggests that the developer took reasonable precautions to prevent damage to adjacent properties.\n\nOption D states that the developer's only obligation was to satisfy all local, state, and federal safety regulations. If they did that, then they've discharged their duty, and there's no liability for any resulting damage.\n\nThis seems like a strong statement. While following regulations is important and can be a defense in some cases, it doesn't necessarily absolve someone from all liability, especially if there's negligence beyond just following regulations.\n\nIn many legal systems, particularly in tort law, following regulations may be seen as a minimum standard of care, but not necessarily sufficient to avoid all liability if damage occurs.\n\nSo, if the developer followed all regulations but the excavation still caused damage to the neighboring building, there might still be liability if it can be shown that the developer was negligent in some way.\n\nOption C, as I mentioned earlier, suggests that with a building on the land, the owner cannot invoke the right of lateral support. This might be the case in some jurisdictions, but I think it's more accurate to say that the right to lateral support can be modified by the presence of improvements.\n\nIn fact, some legal doctrines recognize that once a building is constructed, the neighboring landowner may have an obligation to support that building, at least to some extent.\n\nGiven that, option C seems too absolute.\n\nBetween options A, B, and D, option B seems to strike a balance between the developer's right to develop their property and the investor's right to have their building remain stable.\n\nThe developer is excavating deeper and using shoring that meets safety regulations. However, the investor's building is suffering damage, despite these precautions.\n\nIf the developer followed all regulations and used appropriate shoring, it might be difficult for the investor to prove negligence solely based on the fact that damage occurred.\n\nOn the other hand, if the investor can show that the developer was negligent in some aspect of the excavation process, beyond just following regulations, then there might be liability.\n\nFor example, if the shoring was adequate according to regulations but the developer failed to monitor the adjacent building for signs of subsidence or didn't take additional preventive measures when cracks started to appear, that could be seen as negligence.\n\nIn this scenario, the developer was notified of cracks developing in the investor's building but continued with the excavation, asserting that any subsidence was due to the weight of the investor's building.\n\nThis assertion suggests that the developer believed they were not at fault because the investor's building was overburdening the soil, especially since the natural state of the land wouldn't have such issues.\n\nHowever, the fact that the developer continued with the excavation despite being notified of potential damage could be seen as a failure to take reasonable steps to prevent further harm.\n\nIn such a situation, the developer might be found negligent for not taking additional precautions or pausing the excavation to assess the situation.\n\nTherefore, option B seems the most accurate because it indicates that mere proof of support removal isn't sufficient for liability, but negligence could be a basis for recovery.\n\nOption A oversimplifies the issue by focusing only on the removal of support, without considering whether that act was negligent or not.\n\nOption C is likely incorrect because it makes a blanket statement that improved land doesn't entitle the owner to lateral support, which may not hold in all jurisdictions or under all circumstances.\n\nOption D is too absolute in stating that satisfying safety regulations is the only obligation, ignoring the possibility of negligence beyond just following the rules.\n\nIn conclusion, the best comment concerning the investor's action to recover damages from the developer is option B: the developer cannot be held liable simply upon proof that support was removed, but may be held liable if negligence is proved.\n\nThis option recognizes that following regulations is important but that liability can still attach if negligence is established beyond just adhering to those regulations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
