It says: \"If a client has difficulty in learning new adaptive responses due to interference from old learning, this is a case of...\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. reminiscence\n\nB. retroactive inhibition\n\nC. latent learning\n\nD. proactive inhibition\n\nHmm, let's break this down. The client is having trouble learning new things because of their previous learning. So, it's about new learning being interfered with by old learning.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each term means:\n\nA. Reminiscence: I think this has to do with remembering past events, maybe in a therapeutic context. But it doesn't seem to fit here because the issue is about learning new things, not recalling old memories.\n\nB. Retroactive inhibition: I recall that this is when new learning interferes with old learning. So, it's the opposite of what's being described in the question. Here, it's old learning interfering with new learning, not the other way around.\n\nC. Latent learning: I believe this is learning that isn't immediately expressed in behavior but can be revealed under certain conditions. Again, doesn't seem to directly relate to the issue of interference between old and new learning.\n\nD. Proactive inhibition: This sounds like it might be the answer because it refers to when old learning interferes with new learning. That matches exactly with the description in the question.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I'm not mixing things up. Proactive inhibition is a type of interference where previously learned information hinders the acquisition of new information. So, in this case, the client's old learning is making it hard for them to learn new adaptive responses.\n\nRetroactive inhibition, on the other hand, is when newly learned information interferes with the recall of older information. So, that's different from what's described in the question.\n\nReminiscence is more about the recall of past memories, often in older adults, and doesn't relate to the interference between old and new learning.\n\nLatent learning is about learning that isn't demonstrated until there's a reason to do so, like a reward or a change in environment. It's not about interference between old and new learning.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be D. proactive inhibition.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider an example. Suppose a client was trained to respond in a certain way to a stimulus, and now, in a new context, they need to learn a different response to the same stimulus, but they're struggling because of their previous training. This scenario describes proactive inhibition, where the old learning is interfering with the new learning.\n\nSo, I'm confident that D. proactive inhibition is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
