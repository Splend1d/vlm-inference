                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find out which of these four food items\u2014apple, slice of bread, cheeseburger, or broccoli\u2014is the cheapest in terms of price per calorie and also the most nutritious. Okay, so there are two main aspects here: price per calorie and nutrition.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"price per calorie\" means. It's essentially how much money you have to spend to get one calorie from a particular food. The lower the price per calorie, the more cost-effective the food is for providing energy (calories).\n\nBut wait, the question also mentions \"the most nutritious.\" So, it's not just about calories; it's about the overall nutritional value. Nutrition includes vitamins, minerals, fiber, and other beneficial components that are important for health.\n\nSo, I need to balance two factors:\n\n1. Price per calorie (want it to be low, meaning better value for money in terms of energy).\n\n2. Nutritional value (want it to be high, meaning the food provides more nutrients relative to its calorie content).\n\nTo approach this, I might need to gather some data:\n\n- Price of each food item.\n\n- Calorie content per serving.\n\n- Nutritional information, such as vitamin and mineral content, fiber, etc.\n\nLet's assume that each food item is purchased individually, without any bulk discounts or special offers.\n\nStarting with the apple:\n\n- Assume an apple costs, say, $0.50.\n\n- A medium apple has about 95 calories.\n\n- Nutrients in an apple include vitamin C, fiber, and various antioxidants.\n\nNext, a slice of bread:\n\n- A loaf of bread might cost $2.00, and there are about 20 slices per loaf.\n\n- So, one slice costs $2.00 / 20 = $0.10.\n\n- A slice of bread has about 70 calories.\n\n- Nutrients include B vitamins, some minerals, and fiber, depending on the type of bread.\n\nThen, a cheeseburger:\n\n- Assume a cheeseburger costs $3.00.\n\n- It has about 300-500 calories, but let's say 400 calories for simplicity.\n\n- Nutrients include protein, some vitamins and minerals from the meat and cheese, but it might also be high in saturated fats and sodium.\n\nLastly, broccoli:\n\n- A bunch of broccoli might cost $1.50, and it weighs about 1 pound.\n\n- One cup of broccoli (about 55 grams) has about 55 calories.\n\n- So, the cost per cup would be $1.50 / (16 ounces / 55 grams per cup), but this conversion might be tricky. Maybe I should look up the exact cost per cup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should find the cost per serving and calories per serving for each food.\n\nLet's try to standardize this.\n\nFor the apple:\n\n- One medium apple: $0.50, 95 calories.\n\nFor the slice of bread:\n\n- One slice: $0.10, 70 calories.\n\nFor the cheeseburger:\n\n- One burger: $3.00, 400 calories.\n\nFor broccoli:\n\n- One cup: let's say $0.25, 55 calories.\n\nNow, to calculate price per calorie:\n\n- Apple: $0.50 / 95 calories = $0.00526 per calorie.\n\n- Bread slice: $0.10 / 70 calories = $0.00143 per calorie.\n\n- Cheeseburger: $3.00 / 400 calories = $0.0075 per calorie.\n\n- Broccoli: $0.25 / 55 calories = $0.00455 per calorie.\n\nSo, based on price per calorie, the slice of bread is the cheapest ($0.00143 per calorie), followed by the cheeseburger ($0.0075), broccoli ($0.00455), and the apple ($0.00526).\n\nBut we also need to consider nutrition. Nutrition can be a bit more complex because it involves various nutrients, and different foods excel in different areas.\n\nOne way to quantify nutrition is to look at nutrient density, which is the amount of nutrients relative to the calorie content.\n\nA common method is to use a nutrient density score, such as the Nutrient Density Index or the Nutrient-to-Calorie Ratio.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll consider a few key nutrients: vitamin C, fiber, and protein.\n\nLet's assign some approximate values:\n\nApple:\n\n- Vitamin C: 10% DV (Daily Value)\n\n- Fiber: 5% DV\n\n- Protein: minimal\n\nSlice of bread:\n\n- Vitamin B6: 10% DV\n\n- Iron: 10% DV\n\n- Fiber: 5% DV\n\n- Protein: about 4 grams\n\nCheeseburger:\n\n- Protein: 20-25 grams\n\n- Iron: 20% DV\n\n- Vitamin B12: 50% DV\n\n- Saturated fat: 15% DV\n\n- Sodium: 30% DV\n\nBroccoli:\n\n- Vitamin C: 150% DV\n\n- Vitamin K: 200% DV\n\n- Fiber: 10% DV\n\n- Protein: about 4 grams\n\nNow, I need a way to combine these nutrients into a single score. Since different nutrients have different daily values and importance, this can be tricky.\n\nOne simple approach is to sum the percentage daily values of beneficial nutrients and subtract the percentage daily values of less beneficial components like saturated fat and sodium.\n\nSo, for each food, calculate:\n\nNutrient Score = (sum of % DV of beneficial nutrients) - (sum of % DV of less beneficial components)\n\nFor apple:\n\n10% (Vitamin C) + 5% (fiber) = 15%\n\nNo significant less beneficial components.\n\nScore: 15\n\nSlice of bread:\n\n10% (B6) + 10% (iron) + 5% (fiber) = 25%\n\nNo significant less beneficial components.\n\nScore: 25\n\nCheeseburger:\n\n20% (iron) + 50% (B12) = 70%\n\nLess beneficial: 15% (saturated fat) + 30% (sodium) = 45%\n\nScore: 70 - 45 = 25\n\nBroccoli:\n\n150% (Vitamin C) + 200% (Vitamin K) + 10% (fiber) = 360%\n\nNo significant less beneficial components.\n\nScore: 360\n\nNow, to combine this with the price per calorie.\n\nPerhaps I can create a composite score that considers both nutrient density and price per calorie.\n\nOne way is to divide the nutrient score by the price per calorie.\n\nSo, Composite Score = Nutrient Score / Price per Calorie\n\nHigher composite scores indicate better value in terms of both cost and nutrition.\n\nCalculating this:\n\nApple:\n\n15 / 0.00526 \u2248 2851.7\n\nBread slice:\n\n25 / 0.00143 \u2248 17482.5\n\nCheeseburger:\n\n25 / 0.0075 \u2248 3333.3\n\nBroccoli:\n\n360 / 0.00455 \u2248 79123.5\n\nWait, these numbers seem too large. Maybe I should adjust the units or the approach.\n\nAlternatively, since price per calorie is in dollars per calorie, and nutrient score is dimensionless, the composite score would have units of (nutrient score) / (dollars per calorie) = nutrient score per dollar.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nSo, higher scores mean more nutrients per dollar spent.\n\nWith that in mind, broccoli has by far the highest composite score (79123.5), followed by bread (17482.5), cheeseburger (3333.3), and apple (2851.7).\n\nTherefore, broccoli offers the best combination of nutritional value and cost-effectiveness in terms of price per calorie.\n\nBut wait a minute, perhaps I should consider the serving sizes and real-world scenarios.\n\nFor example, one cup of broccoli has only 55 calories, which might not be sufficient for someone needing more energy.\n\nSimilarly, one slice of bread has 70 calories, which is also relatively low.\n\nAn apple has 95 calories, and a cheeseburger has 400 calories.\n\nSo, if someone needs, say, 2000 calories a day, they would need to eat a lot of broccoli to meet their energy needs, which might be impractical.\n\nHowever, the question is about price per calorie and nutrition, not about meeting total daily energy needs.\n\nStill, it's worth considering that broccoli, while highly nutritious per calorie and per dollar, may not be sufficient on its own for energy requirements.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nBased on the composite score, broccoli is the cheapest and most nutritious option per dollar spent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Broccoli.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
