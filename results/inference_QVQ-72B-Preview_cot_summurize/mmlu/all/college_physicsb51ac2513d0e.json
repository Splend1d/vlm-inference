                    "text": "So I've got this problem about sound waves diffracting out of a speaker enclosure. The speaker has a long rectangular slit that's 0.14 meters across, and the sound waves are moving at 350 meters per second. I need to find out at what frequency the sound will first disappear at an angle of 45 degrees from the normal to the speaker face. The options are 500 Hz, 1,750 Hz, 2,750 Hz, and 3,500 Hz.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how diffraction works for sound waves. Diffraction is when waves bend around obstacles or spread out after passing through an opening. The amount of diffraction depends on the relationship between the wavelength of the wave and the size of the opening. If the wavelength is much larger than the opening, there will be significant diffraction. If the wavelength is much smaller, the wave will behave more like a particle and less like a wave, meaning less diffraction.\n\nIn this case, the opening is a long rectangular slit that's 0.14 meters across. I assume this is the width of the slit, which will be the dimension that affects the diffraction pattern. The sound waves are moving at 350 meters per second, and I need to find the frequency at which the sound first disappears at an angle of 45 degrees from the normal to the speaker face.\n\nI think this problem is related to diffraction grating or single-slit diffraction. Since it's a single slit, it's probably single-slit diffraction. In single-slit diffraction, there are minima (dark fringes) at certain angles where the wave interference cancels out, resulting in no intensity at those angles.\n\nThe condition for a minimum in a single-slit diffraction pattern is given by:\n\n\\[ d \\sin \\theta = m \\lambda \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( d \\) is the width of the slit\n\n- \\( \\theta \\) is the angle from the normal to the central maximum to the minimum\n\n- \\( m \\) is an integer (the order of the minimum, starting from 1 for the first minimum)\n\n- \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength of the light\n\nIn this problem, we're dealing with sound waves instead of light, but the principle should be similar because both are waves. So, I can use this equation, but I need to make sure I'm using the correct units and values.\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\( d = 0.14 \\) meters\n\n- \\( v = 350 \\) meters per second (speed of sound)\n\n- \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\)\n\n- \\( m = 1 \\) (first minimum)\n\nI need to find the frequency \\( f \\), since \\( \\lambda = \\frac{v}{f} \\).\n\nFirst, plug \\( m = 1 \\) and \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) into the diffraction formula:\n\n\\[ d \\sin \\theta = m \\lambda \\]\n\n\\[ 0.14 \\times \\sin(45^\\circ) = 1 \\times \\lambda \\]\n\nI know that \\( \\sin(45^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx 0.7071 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ 0.14 \\times 0.7071 = \\lambda \\]\n\n\\[ \\lambda \\approx 0.099 \\) meters\n\nNow, since \\( \\lambda = \\frac{v}{f} \\), I can solve for \\( f \\):\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{v}{\\lambda} \\]\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{350}{0.099} \\]\n\n\\[ f \\approx 3535.35 \\) Hz\n\nBut this is not matching any of the options provided. The closest option is 3,500 Hz, but my calculation gives approximately 3,535 Hz.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake in assuming \\( m = 1 \\). The problem says \"first disappear,\" which should correspond to the first minimum, so \\( m = 1 \\) seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the slit width \\( d \\) is different from what I thought. Let me double-check the units. The slit is 0.14 meters across, which seems reasonable for a speaker enclosure.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the diffraction formula for light applies directly to sound waves. Maybe there's a difference in the way sound waves diffract through slits compared to light.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the first minimum in sound diffraction. Let me see if I can find the correct formula for sound wave diffraction through a slit.\n\nAfter some research, I find that for sound waves passing through a single slit, the angular position of the first minimum is given by:\n\n\\[ \\sin \\theta = \\frac{1.22 \\lambda}{d} \\]\n\nThis is similar to the formula for light diffraction but has a constant factor of approximately 1.22 for the first minimum.\n\nUsing this formula:\n\n\\[ \\sin \\theta = \\frac{1.22 \\lambda}{d} \\]\n\nGiven \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\), \\( d = 0.14 \\) m, and \\( v = 350 \\) m/s.\n\nFirst, solve for \\( \\lambda \\):\n\n\\[ \\sin(45^\\circ) = \\frac{1.22 \\lambda}{0.14} \\]\n\n\\[ 0.7071 = \\frac{1.22 \\lambda}{0.14} \\]\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{0.14 \\times 0.7071}{1.22} \\]\n\n\\[ \\lambda \\approx \\frac{0.099}{1.22} \\]\n\n\\[ \\lambda \\approx 0.081 \\) meters\n\nNow, \\( f = \\frac{v}{\\lambda} \\):\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{350}{0.081} \\]\n\n\\[ f \\approx 4319.75 \\) Hz\n\nThis is still not matching any of the options provided. The closest is 3,500 Hz, but my calculation gives approximately 4,320 Hz.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something here. Perhaps the constant factor for the first minimum is different for sound waves compared to light.\n\nLet me try to look up the exact factor for the first minimum in sound diffraction through a slit.\n\nAfter some research, I find that for sound waves passing through a slit, the angular position of the first minimum is given by:\n\n\\[ \\sin \\theta = \\frac{1.84 \\lambda}{d} \\]\n\nThis is based on the Bessel function zeros for circular apertures, but since it's a slit, it might be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the formula for diffraction from a single slit in acoustics. Let me think differently.\n\nIn acoustics, the condition for the first minimum in the diffraction pattern of a single slit is:\n\n\\[ \\sin \\theta = \\frac{\\lambda}{d} \\]\n\nThis is similar to the optical formula I used earlier, without the 1.22 factor.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the initial approach is correct, and there's an error in the options provided.\n\nLet me recalculate using the original formula:\n\n\\[ d \\sin \\theta = m \\lambda \\]\n\nFor \\( m = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{d \\sin \\theta}{1} = 0.14 \\times \\sin(45^\\circ) = 0.14 \\times 0.7071 \\approx 0.099 \\) meters\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{v}{\\lambda} = \\frac{350}{0.099} \\approx 3535.35 \\) Hz\n\nThis is closest to option D, 3,500 Hz.\n\nBut let's see if there's a better match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the first minimum at 45 degrees corresponds to a different order.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the relationship between the wavelength and the slit width more carefully.\n\nLet me consider the Rayleigh criterion for diffraction, which states that the first minimum occurs when:\n\n\\[ \\theta = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{d}\\right) \\]\n\nGiven that \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\), I can set:\n\n\\[ 45^\\circ = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{0.14}\\right) \\]\n\n\\[ \\sin(45^\\circ) = \\frac{\\lambda}{0.14} \\]\n\n\\[ \\lambda = 0.14 \\times \\sin(45^\\circ) \\approx 0.14 \\times 0.7071 \\approx 0.099 \\) meters\n\nAgain, \\( f = \\frac{v}{\\lambda} = \\frac{350}{0.099} \\approx 3535.35 \\) Hz\n\nThis reinforces my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a factor of 2 missing somewhere.\n\nLet me try:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{d \\sin \\theta}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{0.14 \\times 0.7071}{2} \\approx 0.0495 \\) meters\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{v}{\\lambda} = \\frac{350}{0.0495} \\approx 7070.71 \\) Hz\n\nThis is not matching any options either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the slit width corresponds to half the wavelength at the first minimum.\n\nIf \\( d = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\), then \\( \\lambda = 2d = 0.28 \\) meters\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{v}{\\lambda} = \\frac{350}{0.28} = 1250 \\) Hz\n\nStill not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is \\( d = \\lambda \\), meaning \\( \\lambda = 0.14 \\) meters\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{v}{\\lambda} = \\frac{350}{0.14} = 2500 \\) Hz\n\nCloser to option C, 2,750 Hz, but still not exact.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the relationship between the wavelength and the slit width for the first minimum.\n\nLet me recall that for a single slit, the first minimum occurs when the path difference is half a wavelength, i.e., \\( d \\sin \\theta = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\)\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\lambda}{2} = d \\sin \\theta \\]\n\n\\[ \\lambda = 2 d \\sin \\theta \\]\n\n\\[ \\lambda = 2 \\times 0.14 \\times 0.7071 \\approx 0.198 \\) meters\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{v}{\\lambda} = \\frac{350}{0.198} \\approx 1767.67 \\) Hz\n\nThis is closest to option B, 1,750 Hz.\n\nHmm, this is interesting. Now I have two different results: approximately 3,535 Hz and approximately 1,768 Hz.\n\nI need to determine which one is correct.\n\nLet me look up the exact condition for the first minimum in single-slit diffraction for sound waves.\n\nAfter some research, I find that for a single slit, the condition for the first minimum is indeed \\( d \\sin \\theta = m \\lambda \\), where \\( m = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\) for the first, second, third, etc., minima.\n\nGiven that, and \\( m = 1 \\), \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\), \\( d = 0.14 \\) m, and \\( v = 350 \\) m/s, my initial calculation of \\( f \\approx 3535.35 \\) Hz seems correct.\n\nHowever, perhaps the problem is considering the first minimum to correspond to \\( m = 2 \\) or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding of what \"first disappear\" means in this context.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"At about what frequency will the sound first disappear at an angle of 45 degrees from the normal to the speaker face?\"\n\n\"First disappear\" likely refers to the first minimum in the diffraction pattern, which corresponds to \\( m = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, using \\( m = 1 \\), \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\), \\( d = 0.14 \\) m, and \\( v = 350 \\) m/s, I get \\( f \\approx 3535.35 \\) Hz, which is closest to option D, 3,500 Hz.\n\nHowever, considering the options provided, 3,500 Hz is not exactly matching my calculation, but it's the closest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the problem or the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of the speed of sound being approximately 343 m/s at standard temperature and pressure, but it's given as 350 m/s, which might be an approximation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the slit width is misinterpreted. Maybe it's 14 cm instead of 0.14 meters.\n\nWait, 0.14 meters is 14 centimeters, which seems reasonable for a speaker enclosure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle is not 45 degrees but something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the geometry of the setup more carefully.\n\nLet me consider that the speaker is emitting sound waves that diffract through the slit, and I'm observing the intensity at an angle of 45 degrees from the normal.\n\nIn single-slit diffraction, the intensity pattern is given by:\n\n\\[ I(\\theta) = I_0 \\left( \\frac{\\sin \\beta}{\\beta} \\right)^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\beta = \\frac{\\pi d \\sin \\theta}{\\lambda} \\)\n\nThe minima occur when \\( \\beta = m \\pi \\), which corresponds to \\( d \\sin \\theta = m \\lambda \\), which aligns with my earlier formula.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach seems correct.\n\nGiven that, and my calculation leading to approximately 3,535 Hz, I would conclude that the answer is closest to option D, 3,500 Hz.\n\nHowever, since my calculation gives approximately 3,535 Hz and the options are in whole numbers, perhaps the exact answer is 3,500 Hz, and the approximation is due to rounding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options, and 3,500 Hz is the intended answer.\n\nTherefore, I will select option D, 3,500 Hz, as the closest to my calculation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{D}"
