One morning, a customer comes in to make a deposit and hands her a $5 bill that's misprinted\u2014President Lincoln's picture is upside down. The woman knows that this kind of misprinted bill is worth $500 to bill collectors. So, she offers the customer to exchange \"that old $5 bill\" for a new one, and the customer agrees, handing over the misprinted bill for a new one.\n\nA week later, the customer finds out that the $5 bill he gave away was worth $500. Now, he wants to make a claim against the woman for deceit. The question is, will he prevail?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Yes, because the customer was the true owner of the misprinted bill and, therefore, he was entitled to the benefit of the bargain.\n\nB. Yes, because the woman did not disclose the true value of the misprinted bill.\n\nC. No, because the woman made no false representation of fact.\n\nD. No, because the customer was not justified in relying on the woman's offer.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, what is deceit? Deceit is basically lying or intentionally misleading someone to their detriment. So, for the customer to succeed in a claim of deceit, he would need to show that the woman intentionally misled him in some way that caused him to suffer a loss.\n\nOption A says that the customer was the true owner of the misprinted bill and therefore entitled to its value. Well, that seems straightforward. He owned the bill, and it was worth $500, but he only got $5 in return. So, he lost $495. But does that mean deceit occurred?\n\nWait, deceit involves intentional misrepresentation. So, was there an intentional misrepresentation here?\n\nOption B says yes, because the woman did not disclose the true value of the misprinted bill. Hmm. But did she have a duty to disclose that information? In general, in a transaction, do people have a duty to tell the other party the value of what they're exchanging?\n\nI'm not sure. Maybe not necessarily. If I sell you something and you don't know its value, I don't think I'm obligated to tell you its worth, unless there's some special relationship or duty of care between us.\n\nOption C says no, because the woman made no false representation of fact. That seems relevant. Deceit requires a false statement of fact. Did the woman make any false statement?\n\nShe said, \"Would you like to exchange that old $5 bill for a new bill?\" Is that a false statement? No, it's a proposal to exchange one bill for another. She didn't lie about the nature of the exchange. She offered a new bill for an old one, and the customer agreed.\n\nSo, maybe there was no false representation. She didn't say anything that was factually incorrect.\n\nOption D says no, because the customer was not justified in relying on the woman's offer. Well, reliance is part of deceit. The customer did rely on her offer and exchanged the bill. But was his reliance unjustified?\n\nWait, perhaps the customer should have known that the bill was misprinted and might have been worth more, but he didn't check. So, maybe his reliance on her offer to exchange it for a new bill was unjustified because he didn't exercise due care in assessing the value of what he was giving away.\n\nBut, on the other hand, the average person might not know that a misprinted bill is valuable, so maybe his reliance was justified.\n\nBut, in this case, the woman knew it was worth $500, and she didn't tell him. Does that matter?\n\nI think the key here is whether the woman made any false statements or had a duty to disclose the value of the bill.\n\nShe didn't make any false statements; she just offered to exchange the bill without mentioning its value. So, perhaps she didn't commit deceit because she didn't lie or misrepresent any facts.\n\nHowever, it feels a bit shady that she knew its value and didn't tell the customer. But is that enough for deceit?\n\nMaybe the customer could argue that there was a special relationship between them, like a fiduciary duty, since she was a bank teller and he was a customer. But I don't think bank tellers have fiduciary duties to their customers in every transaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a case for unfair enrichment or something, but that's not deceit.\n\nSo, considering the options, I think Option C is the correct answer: No, because the woman made no false representation of fact.\n\nShe didn't lie; she just didn't tell the customer about the bill's value. Therefore, there was no deceit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
