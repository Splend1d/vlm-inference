Hmm, I remember that DES uses a 56-bit key, but I think that's the overall key size, not necessarily per round.\n\nLet me recall how DES works. DES is a symmetric block cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks of data. It uses a 56-bit key, but the key schedule algorithm generates a different subkey for each of the 16 rounds. So, the main key is 56 bits, but it's expanded and processed to create these round subkeys.\n\nI think the subkey for each round is 48 bits. Let me verify that. The key schedule takes the 56-bit key and generates 16 different 48-bit subkeys, one for each round. Yeah, that sounds familiar. So, option C is 48, which seems right.\n\nWait, but why 48 bits? Is there a reason for that specific size? I think it has to do with the way DES is structured. Each round consists of permutation and substitution operations. The subkey is XORed with the round input after permutation and before substitution. The S-boxes in DES take 6 bits as input and produce 4 bits as output, and there are 8 S-boxes. So, total input to S-boxes is 48 bits (8 * 6 = 48), and output is 32 bits (8 * 4 = 32). But the subkey is XORed with the round input before the S-boxes, which is 48 bits.\n\nActually, now that I think about it, the round input after expansion is 48 bits, and the subkey is also 48 bits, so they can be XORed together. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the subkey length for each round in DES is indeed 48 bits. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 48.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check. The DES algorithm has a key size of 56 bits, and it goes through 16 rounds, each using a 48-bit subkey derived from the main key. Yeah, that's consistent with what I've learned.\n\nI should also remember that the key schedule involves permutation and shifting, and it generates these 48-bit subkeys for each round. So, no, options A, B, or D don't seem correct. 32 bits would be too small, 56 is the overall key size, and 64 is the block size and the key schedule initially expands the key to 64 bits with parity bits, but the effective key is 56 bits.\n\nYeah, I'm confident that the subkey length per round is 48 bits.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
