                    "text": "So I have this problem about Carmen and her spending habits. She spends all her weekly income on two goods: X and Y. At her current consumption level, the marginal utility of the last dollar spent on X is 5, and for Y, it's 10. I need to figure out what she should do to maximize her utility.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what utility maximization is all about. Utility maximization is when a consumer gets the most satisfaction from the goods they buy, given their budget constraints. There's a rule for this, right? It's called the utility maximization rule.\n\nI think the rule is that to maximize utility, the marginal utility per dollar spent should be the same for all goods. So, MUx/Px = MUy/Py, where MUx is the marginal utility of X, Px is the price of X, MUy is the marginal utility of Y, and Py is the price of Y.\n\nBut in this problem, it seems like they're talking about the marginal utility per dollar spent on each good. They say the marginal utility of the last dollar spent on X is 5 and on Y is 10. So, it looks like MUx/Px = 5 and MUy/Py = 10.\n\nWait a minute, but they don't give me the actual prices of X and Y. Hmm. Maybe I don't need the prices to figure this out.\n\nLet me think differently. If the marginal utility per dollar is higher for Y than for X (10 vs. 5), that means Carmen is getting more satisfaction per dollar spent on Y compared to X. So, intuitively, she should shift her spending towards Y to get more total utility.\n\nThat would mean she should buy fewer units of X and more units of Y. But let's see if that makes sense with the theory.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's more to it. Maybe I need to consider the law of diminishing marginal utility. As she buys more of Y, the marginal utility of Y might decrease, and vice versa for X.\n\nBut in this problem, since we're looking at her current consumption level, and at that level, MU per dollar for Y is higher than for X, it still seems like she should buy more Y and less X to equalize the MU per dollar spent on both goods.\n\nLet me try to formalize this. Suppose she shifts some spending from X to Y. If she buys less X, the MU of X might increase (since marginal utility decreases as consumption increases), and the MU of Y might decrease because she's buying more Y.\n\nSo, if she shifts spending, the MU per dollar of X would increase, and the MU per dollar of Y would decrease. She should keep shifting until MUx/Px = MUy/Py.\n\nGiven that currently, MUx/Px = 5 and MUy/Py = 10, she should shift spending towards Y until both are equal.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B: buy fewer units of X and more units of Y.\n\nBut let's double-check. Is there any other factor that could influence this decision?\n\nWhat if the prices of X and Y are different? For example, if X is more expensive than Y, maybe that affects her choices. But no, because the MU per dollar already takes into account the price.\n\nWait, actually, MU per dollar is MU divided by price. So, if X is more expensive, but MUx/Px is still 5, that means she's getting less MU per dollar on X compared to Y, so she should still shift towards Y.\n\nAlternatively, what if Y is much more expensive, but she's getting higher MU per dollar on Y. But in this case, it's already given that MUy/Py = 10, which is higher than MUx/Px = 5.\n\nSo, regardless of the prices, since MU per dollar is higher for Y, she should buy more Y and less X.\n\nI think the answer is clear: Carmen should buy fewer units of X and more units of Y to maximize her utility.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
