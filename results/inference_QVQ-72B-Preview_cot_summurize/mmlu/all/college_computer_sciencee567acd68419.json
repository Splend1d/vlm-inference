                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a parallel program that takes 100 seconds when run on a single processor. Forty percent of this computation is inherently sequential, meaning it can't be sped up by adding more processors. The question is asking for the theoretically best possible elapsed times when we use 2 and 4 processors, respectively.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"inherently sequential\" means in this context. If 40% of the computation is sequential, that means 60% can be parallelized, right? So, out of the 100 seconds, 40% is sequential and 60% is parallelizable.\n\nLet me calculate the time for each part:\n\nSequential time: 40% of 100 seconds = 0.4 * 100 = 40 seconds\n\nParallelizable time: 60% of 100 seconds = 0.6 * 100 = 60 seconds\n\nNow, when we add more processors, the parallel part can be divided among them, potentially reducing the execution time.\n\nI recall Amdahl's law, which is used to find the maximum theoretical speedup for a program running on multiple processors. The formula is:\n\n1 / (S + P/n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- S is the fraction of the program that is sequential\n\n- P is the fraction that is parallel\n\n- n is the number of processors\n\nBut wait, in this case, it's slightly different. Amdahl's law is usually stated as:\n\n1 / (S + (1 - S)/n)\n\nWhere S is the sequential fraction.\n\nIn this problem, S is given as 40%, or 0.4, and P is 60%, or 0.6.\n\nSo, for n processors, the theoretical minimum execution time T_min is:\n\nT_min = S * T_total + P * T_total / n\n\nWhere T_total is the original execution time on one processor.\n\nWait, that seems similar to Amdahl's law. Let me confirm.\n\nAmdahl's law gives the total time as:\n\nT = S * T_total + (1 - S) * T_total / n\n\nYes, that matches what I wrote.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nFor 2 processors:\n\nT_min = 0.4 * 100 + 0.6 * 100 / 2 = 40 + 0.6 * 50 = 40 + 30 = 70 seconds\n\nFor 4 processors:\n\nT_min = 0.4 * 100 + 0.6 * 100 / 4 = 40 + 0.6 * 25 = 40 + 15 = 55 seconds\n\nLooking back at the options, that corresponds to option D: 70 and 55 seconds.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nI remember that Amdahl's law assumes that the parallel parts can be perfectly divided among the processors without any overhead. In reality, there might be communication overhead or other factors that could make the actual speedup less than this theoretical maximum. However, the question is asking for the theoretically best possible elapsed times, so this calculation should hold.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the speedup. The speedup S is defined as T1 / T_p, where T1 is the time on one processor and T_p is the time on p processors.\n\nBut in this case, since 40% is sequential, the speedup for the parallel part is only limited by the parallelizable portion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for Amdahl's law directly.\n\nThe formula for the execution time with n processors is:\n\nT(n) = (S) * T1 + (1 - S) * T1 / n\n\nWhich is what I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for speedup is:\n\nS(n) = 1 / (S + (1 - S)/n)\n\nThen, the time T(n) = T1 / S(n)\n\nBut using the first formula seems more straightforward.\n\nLet me verify with n=1:\n\nT(1) = 0.4*100 + 0.6*100 / 1 = 40 + 60 = 100 seconds, which matches the given time.\n\nFor n=2:\n\nT(2) = 40 + 30 = 70 seconds\n\nFor n=4:\n\nT(4) = 40 + 15 = 55 seconds\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the speedup formula:\n\nS(2) = 1 / (0.4 + 0.6/2) = 1 / (0.4 + 0.3) = 1 / 0.7 \u2248 1.4286\n\nThen, T(2) = 100 / 1.4286 \u2248 70 seconds\n\nAnd S(4) = 1 / (0.4 + 0.6/4) = 1 / (0.4 + 0.15) = 1 / 0.55 \u2248 1.8182\n\nThen, T(4) = 100 / 1.8182 \u2248 55 seconds\n\nAgain, the same results.\n\nSo, the theoretically best possible elapsed times are 70 seconds with 2 processors and 55 seconds with 4 processors.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 70 and 55 seconds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{D}\\]"
