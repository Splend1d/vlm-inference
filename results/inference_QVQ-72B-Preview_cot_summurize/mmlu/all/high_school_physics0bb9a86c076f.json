                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about a spherical charge distribution where the volume charge density \u03c1 is given by \u03c1 = ar, with a being a positive constant, and the distribution extends out to a radius R. I need to figure out how the electric field strength behaves at a distance r from the center, especially compared to R.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Gauss's law, which is a good way to find the electric field due to symmetric charge distributions like this one. Gauss's law states that the electric flux through any closed surface is equal to the total charge enclosed divided by \u03b5\u2080, where \u03b5\u2080 is the permittivity of free space. Mathematically, \u222eE\u00b7dA = Q_enc / \u03b5\u2080.\n\nSince the charge distribution is spherical, I'll use a spherical Gaussian surface of radius r centered at the center of the sphere. There are two cases to consider: one where r < R (inside the charge distribution) and one where r > R (outside the charge distribution).\n\nLet's start with r < R.\n\n**Case 1: r < R**\n\nIn this case, the Gaussian surface is entirely within the charge distribution. I need to find the charge enclosed within this Gaussian surface.\n\nThe charge density is \u03c1 = ar, which means the charge density increases linearly with radius. That's interesting.\n\nTo find the total charge Q_enc within the Gaussian surface of radius r, I need to integrate the charge density over the volume enclosed by the Gaussian surface.\n\nThe volume element in spherical coordinates is dV = 4\u03c0r\u00b2 dr, so the charge dq is \u03c1 dV = ar * 4\u03c0r\u00b2 dr = 4\u03c0a r\u00b3 dr.\n\nTherefore, Q_enc = \u222b dq from 0 to r = \u222b(4\u03c0a r\u00b3 dr) from 0 to r = 4\u03c0a \u222b(r\u00b3 dr) from 0 to r = 4\u03c0a [r\u2074 / 4] from 0 to r = (\u03c0a r\u2074)/1.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let's double-check that integral.\n\nActually, \u222b r\u00b3 dr = r\u2074 / 4, so yes, Q_enc = 4\u03c0a \u222b r\u00b3 dr from 0 to r = 4\u03c0a [r\u2074 / 4] - 4\u03c0a [0] = \u03c0a r\u2074.\n\nOkay, so Q_enc = \u03c0a r\u2074.\n\nNow, by Gauss's law, the electric flux through the Gaussian surface is E * 4\u03c0r\u00b2 = Q_enc / \u03b5\u2080 = (\u03c0a r\u2074)/\u03b5\u2080.\n\nTherefore, E * 4\u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c0a r\u2074 / \u03b5\u2080.\n\nSolving for E, we get E = (\u03c0a r\u2074)/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080 r\u00b2) = (a r\u00b2)/(4\u03b5\u2080).\n\nSo, for r < R, E \u221d r\u00b2.\n\nThat's a non-linear increase with r.\n\nNow, **case 2: r > R**\n\nHere, the Gaussian surface is entirely outside the charge distribution, so the enclosed charge is the total charge Q_total within the sphere of radius R.\n\nFirst, I need to find Q_total.\n\nUsing the same approach as before, Q_total = \u222b \u03c1 dV from 0 to R.\n\nQ_total = \u222b(ar * 4\u03c0r\u00b2 dr) from 0 to R = 4\u03c0a \u222b r\u00b3 dr from 0 to R = 4\u03c0a [r\u2074 / 4] from 0 to R = \u03c0a R\u2074.\n\nSo, Q_total = \u03c0a R\u2074.\n\nNow, by Gauss's law, E * 4\u03c0r\u00b2 = Q_total / \u03b5\u2080 = \u03c0a R\u2074 / \u03b5\u2080.\n\nTherefore, E = (\u03c0a R\u2074)/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080 r\u00b2) = (a R\u2074)/(4\u03b5\u2080 r\u00b2).\n\nSo, for r > R, E \u221d 1/r\u00b2.\n\nThat's an inverse square relationship, which is typical for a point charge.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. It increases as r approaches infinity.\n\nWell, for r > R, E \u221d 1/r\u00b2, which means E decreases as r increases, not increases. So, this can't be right.\n\nB. It decreases linearly for r > R.\n\nNo, it's 1/r\u00b2, which is not linear. It's an inverse square relationship.\n\nC. It increases linearly for r > R.\n\nAgain, it's 1/r\u00b2, not linear.\n\nD. It increases non-linearly for r < R.\n\nFor r < R, E \u221d r\u00b2, which is indeed a non-linear increase.\n\nSo, the correct choice is D.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says \"at a distance r from the center\", which could include both r < R and r > R. But option D specifies \"for r < R\", which is only part of the picture.\n\nHowever, the question is \"which of the following is true\", and among the options, D is the only one that correctly describes the behavior of the electric field for r < R.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
