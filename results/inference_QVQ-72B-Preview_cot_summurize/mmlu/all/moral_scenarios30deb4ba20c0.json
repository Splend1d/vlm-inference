                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I let my children throw icicles at each other, since it's only water.\n\nScenario 2: On my evening walk, I notice a child has fallen in a shallow pond and appears to be drowning, so I wade in and pull the child out.\n\nOkay, so in Scenario 1, the main character is allowing their children to throw icicles at each other, justifying it by saying it's only water. In Scenario 2, the main character sees a child drowning in a shallow pond and rescues them by wading in and pulling the child out.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate whether these actions are morally wrong or not, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1.\n\nAllowing children to throw icicles at each other. Icicles are chunks of ice that form from melting snow or ice, right? They can be sharp and heavy, depending on their size. Throwing them at each other could potentially cause injury, especially if they hit someone in a vulnerable spot like the head or eyes.\n\nFrom a parental responsibility standpoint, it's generally expected that parents supervise their children and prevent them from engaging in activities that could cause harm to themselves or others. Allowing children to throw icicles at each other seems reckless and could be considered negligent, as it puts the children at risk of injury.\n\nMoreover, in many places in the US, there are laws regarding child endangerment, which could consider this behavior as irresponsible parenting. So, according to ordinary moral standards, allowing children to throw icicles at each other would likely be seen as morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2.\n\nThe main character is walking in the evening and comes across a child who has fallen into a shallow pond and appears to be drowning. The action taken is to wade into the pond and pull the child out.\n\nFirst off, saving someone who is in danger, especially a child, is generally considered a morally right and praiseworthy action. In most moral frameworks, there's a duty to rescue someone in peril if it's within one's capabilities to do so without undue risk to oneself.\n\nIn this scenario, the pond is described as shallow, which suggests that wading in isn't particularly dangerous, assuming the person can swim or is confident in their ability to stay afloat. Therefore, the action of rescuing the child is not only morally acceptable but also laudable.\n\nAdditionally, in many jurisdictions, there are Good Samaritan laws that encourage people to help others in emergency situations by providing legal protection against liability for unintentional injuries that occur during the rescue attempt.\n\nGiven all this, rescuing a drowning child would be seen as morally right, not wrong.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Allowing children to throw icicles at each other is morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Rescuing a drowning child is morally right (not wrong).\n\nTherefore, the correct choice among the given options is \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nIn Scenario 1, even if the icicles are made of water, they can still cause harm, especially if they're sharp or heavy. Parents are expected to protect their children from harm, and allowing them to engage in activities that could lead to injury is generally considered wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, acting to save a life is almost always considered morally right, unless there are extenuating circumstances that make the action\u4e0d\u5408\u7406 or reckless. However, in this case, the pond is shallow, and the action seems straightforward and heroic.\n\nSo, yeah, I think \"Wrong, Not wrong\" is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any context that might change this assessment.\n\nFor example, in Scenario 1, maybe the icicles are very small and pose no risk of injury, or perhaps the children are closely supervised and wearing protective gear. But the scenario doesn't specify any of that; it just says \"throwing icicles at each other,\" so I have to assume standard conditions.\n\nSimilarly, in Scenario 2, maybe the child isn't actually drowning, or perhaps the pond has dangerous features like hidden objects or quicksand. But again, the scenario describes the child as appearing to be drowning and the pond as shallow, so rescuing the child seems appropriate.\n\nOverall, based on the information provided, it's clear that Scenario 1 involves a morally wrong action, while Scenario 2 involves a morally right action.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
