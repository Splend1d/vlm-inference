                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about property law, specifically about remainders and reversion. The question is: when a remainder in the grantor's heirs is invalid and becomes a reversion in the grantor, what is that called? The options are A. Rule in Shelley's Case, B. Related Doctrine of Merger, C. Contingent remainder, D. Doctrine of Worthier Title.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a remainder and a reversion are. A remainder is an interest in property that follows a life estate or some other prior estate. It's like waiting for your turn to own the property after someone else's interest expires. A reversion, on the other hand, is the right to regain possession of the property when the current estate ends, typically belonging to the original owner or grantor.\n\nSo, the question is saying that a remainder interest that's supposed to go to the grantor's heirs is invalid and instead turns into a reversion back to the grantor. I need to find out why this happens and what principle or doctrine causes this transformation.\n\nLet me look at each option:\n\nA. Rule in Shelley's Case: I recall that this rule is about restricting the creation of certain future interests. It states that when a freehold estate is given to someone for life and then to their heirs, it's considered as a fee simple absolute to the life tenant. So, it's about the nature of the estate created, not directly about remainders becoming reversions.\n\nB. Related Doctrine of Merger: I'm not as familiar with this. Maybe it has to do with when two estates in the same property are owned by one person, and they merge into one estate. But I'm not sure how that relates to remainders becoming reversions.\n\nC. Contingent remainder: This sounds like a type of remainder that depends on some condition. If the condition isn't met, maybe the remainder fails and reverts back to the grantor. That could be a possibility.\n\nD. Doctrine of Worthier Title: This rings a bell. I think it's about not creating a remainder in a person who has a prior or better title to the property. So, maybe if the grantor has a better title than their heirs, creating a remainder in the heirs is invalid, and the estate reverts back to the grantor.\n\nLet me think more carefully about the Doctrine of Worthier Title. It seems relevant because it prevents creating a remainder in someone who already has a better estate in the property. In this case, the grantor has a better title than their heirs, so creating a remainder in the heirs would be invalid, and the estate reverts back to the grantor.\n\nI remember that the Doctrine of Worthier Title is about not allowing a person to create a lesser interest in themselves or their heirs when they already have a greater interest. So, if the grantor is conveying a life estate to someone else and then a remainder to their heirs, but they themselves have a fee simple interest, creating a remainder in their heirs might be invalid because the heirs already have a interest through the grantor's fee simple.\n\nWait, that might be a bit confusing. Let's consider an example. Suppose Grantor owns a fee simple absolute in Blackacre. Grantor deeds Blackacre to Life Estate in Grantee, then to Grantor's heirs. According to the Doctrine of Worthier Title, since Grantor has a fee simple, which is a better estate than the remainder in the heirs, creating a remainder in the heirs is invalid. Instead, the estate reverts back to Grantor.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in this scenario, the remainder in the grantor's heirs is invalid due to the Doctrine of Worthier Title, and it becomes a reversion in the grantor.\n\nLet me check the other options again to make sure.\n\nRule in Shelley's Case: That's more about the nature of the estate created when using the term \"heirs.\" It's not directly about remainders becoming reversions in this context.\n\nDoctrine of Merger: This is about combining two estates into one when they are owned by the same person. Doesn't seem directly related to this situation.\n\nContingent remainder: While remainders can be contingent on certain conditions, the specific scenario described seems more aligned with the Doctrine of Worthier Title.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Doctrine of Worthier Title.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
