                    "text": " So I'm reading this article by Callahan, and he's talking about the Dutch Commission on Euthanasia in 1990. I'm supposed to figure out what point he's trying to make with this reference. The options are:\n\nA. Laws permitting euthanasia can and have been abused.\n\nB. Doctors who perform euthanasia may not report doing so.\n\nC. Both A and B.\n\nD. Neither A nor B.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what the Dutch Commission on Euthanasia in 1990 was about. From what I recall, the Netherlands has been at the forefront of the euthanasia debate, and in 1990, they had some significant developments in their approach to euthanasia.\n\nLet me do a quick search to refresh my memory. Oh, wait, I don't have internet access right now. Hmm. Okay, maybe I can recall some details from my ethics class last semester.\n\nIn 1990, the Dutch government set up a commission to study the practice of euthanasia and assisted suicide. This commission was in response to the increasing number of cases where doctors were helping patients end their lives, often without clear legal guidelines.\n\nOne of the key findings of this commission was that there were instances where euthanasia was performed without the explicit request of the patient. That sounds like a case of abuse, doesn't it? So, if doctors were performing euthanasia without the patient's consent, that would be against the principles that euthanasia should only be carried out at the patient's voluntary and well-informed request.\n\nAlso, I remember that the commission reported that not all cases of euthanasia were being reported by doctors. There was underreporting, which suggests that doctors might be performing euthanasia and not disclosing it, possibly to avoid legal repercussions or maintain their medical practice's reputation.\n\nSo, if Callahan is discussing this commission, he might be highlighting these findings to argue that permitting euthanasia can lead to abuses, such as doctors taking matters into their own hands without proper consent, and also that there might be a lack of transparency in reporting these practices.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. Option A suggests that laws permitting euthanasia can and have been abused. Based on the commission's findings, that seems accurate because there were cases where euthanasia was performed without the patient's request, which is a clear violation of the ethical and legal standards.\n\nOption B states that doctors who perform euthanasia may not report doing so. Again, the commission found evidence of underreporting, so this also seems to be the case.\n\nTherefore, both A and B seem to be supported by the commission's findings. So, the answer should be C: both A and B.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that Callahan is indeed using the commission's report to make these points. Maybe he has a different angle or is focusing on something else.\n\nRecalling back to the article, I think he was discussing the potential risks and ethical concerns associated with legalizing euthanasia. He might be using the Dutch Commission's report as an example to illustrate these risks.\n\nAdditionally, I think he might be emphasizing the importance of having stringent regulations and oversight to prevent such abuses. But in this particular reference, I believe he's primarily highlighting the abuses that can occur when euthanasia is permitted.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the Dutch model has evolved over the years. After the 1990 commission, the Netherlands further refined its euthanasia laws, leading to the Termination of Life on Request and Assisted Suicide (Review Procedures) Act in 2002, which legalized euthanasia under strict conditions.\n\nBut since the commission was in 1990, it was during a time when the practices were being examined to inform future policies.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I think Callahan is using the Dutch Commission's findings to support the idea that laws permitting euthanasia can be abused, and that doctors may not report all cases of euthanasia they perform. Therefore, the answer is C: both A and B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
