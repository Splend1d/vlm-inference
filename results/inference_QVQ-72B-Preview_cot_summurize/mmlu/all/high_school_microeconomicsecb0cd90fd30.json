Differentiated products\n\nB. Patents and copyrights\n\nC. Possibility of profit in the short run\n\nD. Deadweight loss exists\n\nLet me think about each one.\n\nFirst, differentiated products. In monopolistic competition, firms sell products that are similar but not identical. So, they have some differentiation. In a monopoly, the product is unique, and there are no close substitutes. So, in that sense, a monopoly also has a differentiated product, but maybe in a different way. Wait, but the question is asking for something that is part of a monopoly but not of monopolistic competition.\n\nHmm.\n\nNext, patents and copyrights. These are typically associated with monopolies because they give the holder exclusive rights to produce or sell a product or service, limiting competition. In monopolistic competition, there might be some intellectual property protections, but they're not as strong or exclusive as in a monopoly. So, maybe this is a characteristic more of a monopoly than of monopolistic competition.\n\nMoving on to the possibility of profit in the short run. In both monopoly and monopolistic competition, firms can make profits in the short run. In perfect competition, in the long run, profits are driven to zero due to entry and exit of firms. But in monopolistic competition, even in the long run, firms can make positive profits if they have some market power. Similarly, in monopoly, they can make sustained profits. So, this might not be a distinguishing characteristic.\n\nLastly, deadweight loss exists. Deadweight loss is when the allocation of resources is not efficient, often because of market power or other distortions. Both monopoly and monopolistic competition can lead to deadweight loss, as prices are above marginal costs, leading to underproduction compared to the socially optimal level.\n\nSo, considering all this, patents and copyrights seem more directly associated with monopoly than with monopolistic competition.\n\nWait, but in monopolistic competition, could there be patents and copyrights? Well, patents and copyrights can exist in any market structure, but they're more likely to create a monopoly situation by granting exclusive rights. In monopolistic competition, while firms may have some differentiated products, they generally face more competition and their exclusive rights might not be as dominant.\n\nSo, perhaps B. Patents and copyrights is the best answer here.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn monopolistic competition, firms have some market power due to product differentiation, but there are still many competitors. In contrast, a monopoly has no competitors and has exclusive control over the market, often due to barriers like patents or economies of scale.\n\nSo, patents and copyrights are a key way to create those barriers and sustain monopoly power.\n\nTherefore, while patents and copyrights can exist in monopolistic competition, their impact is more significant in creating and maintaining a monopoly.\n\nI think B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
