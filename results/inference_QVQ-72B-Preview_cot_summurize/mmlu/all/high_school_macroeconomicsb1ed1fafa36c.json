                    "text": "Let's see here. So, DVD players are a normal good, and they're traded in a competitive market. If household income increases, all else being equal, what happens to the equilibrium quantity and price? I have four options, but I need to figure out which one makes sense.\n\nFirst off, I know that a normal good is something where demand increases when income increases, holding all else constant. So, if people have more money, they tend to buy more of this good. That means the demand curve should shift to the right, right? Because there's an increase in demand.\n\nSo, if demand increases, what happens to equilibrium quantity and price? I think both should increase. But let me think about it step by step.\n\nLet me draw a simple supply and demand graph in my mind. Initially, there's a demand curve and a supply curve, and they intersect at the equilibrium point, determining the equilibrium price and quantity.\n\nNow, if income increases and DVD players are a normal good, demand increases. That means the demand curve shifts to the right. So, at the original price, there's now excess demand because the new demand is higher than the supply at that price.\n\nThis excess demand will push the price up. As the price starts to rise, the quantity supplied increases (because suppliers see higher prices and produce more), and the quantity demanded decreases (because higher prices lead to less consumption).\n\nThis process continues until a new equilibrium is reached, where the new higher demand and the increased supply meet at a higher price and a higher quantity.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like both equilibrium quantity and price should increase.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Increase the equilibrium quantity and increase the price.\n\nB. Decrease the equilibrium quantity and increase the price.\n\nC. Increase the equilibrium price but the change in quantity is ambiguous.\n\nD. Decrease the equilibrium quantity and decrease the price.\n\nGiven my reasoning, option A seems correct.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other factor that could affect this.\n\nWait, the question says \"all else being equal.\" So, no other changes are happening besides the increase in household income.\n\nIn reality, though, if income increases, people might spend more on DVDs, but also, if the economy is growing, that might affect costs for producers, but the question specifies \"all else being equal,\" so I should assume that only income has changed.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether DVD players are substitutes or complements to other goods. For example, if streaming services are a substitute for DVDs, maybe as income increases, people buy more streaming services and fewer DVDs. But the question specifies that DVD players are a normal good, meaning that demand increases with income, not decreases.\n\nSo, even if there are substitutes, the direct effect of increased income on a normal good should be an increase in demand, leading to higher equilibrium price and quantity.\n\nWait, but what if the increase in income leads to a shift in preferences away from DVDs towards streaming? That would be a shift in demand, but again, the question specifies that DVDs are a normal good, so demand should increase with income.\n\nUnless, perhaps, at higher incomes, DVDs become inferior goods? But that seems unlikely, as the definition of a normal good is that demand increases with income.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating this. The straightforward answer is that for a normal good in a competitive market, an increase in income leads to an increase in demand, which shifts the demand curve rightward, leading to a higher equilibrium price and quantity.\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nBut let's look at option C: increase in equilibrium price but ambiguous change in quantity.\n\nWhy would the change in quantity be ambiguous? Well, if supply is perfectly inelastic, meaning it doesn't respond to price changes, then the quantity supplied wouldn't change, and only the price would adjust. But in that case, the equilibrium quantity wouldn't decrease; it would stay the same.\n\nWait, but if supply is perfectly inelastic, and demand increases, the price goes up, but quantity remains the same. So, in that scenario, quantity doesn't increase; it stays the same.\n\nBut the question is about a competitive market, which might imply that supply can adjust, at least to some extent.\n\nStill, if supply is perfectly inelastic, quantity wouldn't increase; it would remain constant, and only the price would rise.\n\nSo, in that case, the change in quantity is zero, which is neither an increase nor a decrease.\n\nBut option C says \"increase in equilibrium price but the change in quantity is ambiguous.\" That suggests that in some cases, quantity could increase or decrease, depending on the specifics of the supply curve.\n\nBut in this scenario, if demand shifts right and supply is perfectly inelastic, quantity doesn't change; it doesn't increase or decrease. So, it's not ambiguous; it's just that quantity remains constant.\n\nAlternatively, if supply is upward sloping, which is typical, then as price increases, quantity supplied increases.\n\nSo, in the standard case with an upward-sloping supply curve, both price and quantity increase when demand increases.\n\nTherefore, option A is the most straightforward answer, assuming typical supply and demand curves.\n\nOption B suggests that quantity decreases and price increases, which would happen if supply decreases, but in this scenario, only demand is changing, and supply is assumed to remain constant.\n\nOption D suggests quantity decreases and price decreases, which would happen if supply increases significantly while demand decreases, but again, in this scenario, only demand is increasing.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems correct.\n\nBut perhaps there's a trick here. Maybe DVD players are a special case where, with increased income, demand shifts in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a technological advancement that increases supply simultaneously with increased income, but the question says \"all else being equal,\" so we should assume no other changes.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The straightforward answer is that for a normal good, an increase in income leads to an increase in demand, which shifts the demand curve rightward, leading to a higher equilibrium price and quantity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: increase the equilibrium quantity and increase the price.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
