                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here about computer vision and object detection. There are four statements, and I need to pick the false one. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Semantic segmentation models predict the class of each pixel, while multiclass image classifiers predict the class of the entire image.\" Hmm, that sounds right. In semantic segmentation, like in models such as U-Net or SegNet, each pixel is classified into a category. Whereas, multiclass image classifiers like CNNs classify the whole image into one or multiple classes. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption B says: \"A bounding box with an IoU (intersection over union) equal to 96% would likely be considered a true positive.\" IoU is a measure of how much a predicted bounding box overlaps with the ground truth box. A higher IoU means better overlap. Usually, in object detection, a prediction is considered a true positive if its IoU exceeds a certain threshold, often 0.5 or 0.7. But 96% is really high, almost perfect overlap. So, yes, that should definitely be considered a true positive. This seems correct.\n\nOption C says: \"When a predicted bounding box does not correspond to any object in the scene, it is considered a false positive.\" Okay, so in object detection, a false positive is when the model detects an object where there isn't one. That means the predicted box doesn't match any ground truth box. So, this also sounds correct.\n\nOption D says: \"A bounding box with an IoU (intersection over union) equal to 3% would likely be considered a false negative.\" Wait a minute, that doesn't sound right. False negative is when an object is present but the model fails to detect it. However, in this case, there is a predicted bounding box, just with very low overlap (3%). I think this should be considered a false positive, not a false negative. Let me double-check.\n\nIn object detection, a false positive typically occurs when the model detects an object where there isn't one, or when it detects a non-existent object. A false negative is when an object is present but the model doesn't detect it. So, if a bounding box has a very low IoU, like 3%, it means the prediction is way off and doesn't correspond to any actual object. That sounds more like a false positive because the model is incorrectly suggesting there's an object there when there isn't, or it's mislocating the object.\n\nOn the other hand, a false negative would be when there's an object, but the model doesn't put any bounding box around it at all. So, in this case, since there's a predicted bounding box, but it doesn't match the ground truth well, it's more of a false positive.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be false because a bounding box with a 3% IoU would likely be considered a false positive, not a false negative.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- A: Correct\n\n- B: Correct\n\n- C: Correct\n\n- D: False\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
