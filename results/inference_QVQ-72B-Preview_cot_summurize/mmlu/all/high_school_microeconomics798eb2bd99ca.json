                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this economics problem about the market for denim jeans. It says that the market is in equilibrium, and then the price of polyester pants, which are a substitute good, rises. I need to figure out what happens in the jean market because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a substitute good is. A substitute good is something that can be used instead of another good. So, if the price of polyester pants goes up, people might switch to buying more denim jeans instead, right? Because jeans become relatively cheaper compared to polyester pants.\n\nOkay, so if polyester pants are a substitute for denim jeans, and their price increases, I would think that the demand for denim jeans would increase because people would buy more jeans instead of the more expensive polyester pants.\n\nWait, but the question says that the market for denim jeans is in equilibrium initially. So, before any change, supply and demand are balanced, determining the equilibrium price and quantity.\n\nNow, if the price of polyester pants increases, making them less attractive to consumers, some consumers might shift their demand from polyester pants to denim jeans. That means the demand for denim jeans increases.\n\nSo, the demand curve for denim jeans should shift to the right, indicating an increase in demand.\n\nLet me draw this mentally. The demand curve shifts to the right, meaning that at any given price, more quantity is demanded now.\n\nNow, what happens to the equilibrium price and quantity?\n\nWell, if demand increases, and supply remains the same, then the equilibrium price should increase, and the equilibrium quantity should also increase.\n\nWait, but one of the options says that supply falls, which doesn't seem to be the case here. The problem mentions that the price of polyester pants rises, which affects the demand for denim jeans, but doesn't directly mention anything about the supply of denim jeans changing.\n\nSo, assuming that the supply of denim jeans remains unchanged, the increase in demand should lead to a higher equilibrium price and a higher equilibrium quantity.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Supply falls, increasing the price and decreasing the quantity.\n\nBut I don't think supply falls in this scenario. The rise in polyester pants' price affects demand for jeans, not directly supply.\n\nB. Supply falls, increasing the price and increasing the quantity.\n\nAgain, supply doesn't fall; it remains the same.\n\nC. Demand falls, increasing the price and decreasing the quantity.\n\nNo, demand increases, not decreases.\n\nD. Demand rises, increasing the price and increasing the quantity.\n\nThis seems to match my earlier thought. Demand increases, leading to higher price and higher quantity.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure. If demand increases and supply remains constant, then yes, price increases and quantity increases.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Suppose demand increases. At the original price, there is now excess demand, which leads to a pressure on the price to rise.\n\nAs the price rises, the quantity demanded decreases slightly, but the quantity supplied increases, leading to a new equilibrium with a higher price and higher quantity.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, option D seems correct.\n\nBut let's double-check. What if supply is affected indirectly?\n\nFor example, if the price of polyester pants rises, and assuming that the production of polyester pants and denim jeans use similar resources, maybe there's a shift in production.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't provide any information about production costs or resources, so maybe that's overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if polyester pants become more expensive, people buy more jeans, as I initially thought, increasing demand for jeans.\n\nYes, that seems straightforward.\n\nSo, the answer should be D: demand rises, increasing the price and increasing the quantity.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of supply changing.\n\nIf the price of polyester pants rises, and assuming that the production of polyester pants and denim jeans are unrelated in terms of costs, then the supply of denim jeans shouldn't be affected directly.\n\nTherefore, the change in the price of polyester pants only affects the demand for denim jeans, not the supply.\n\nHence, the correct choice is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
