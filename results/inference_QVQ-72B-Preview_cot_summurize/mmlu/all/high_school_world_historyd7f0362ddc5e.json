Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nRodney's argument in the passage is most likely a response to which of the following developments of the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about Walter Rodney's argument in \"How Europe Underdeveloped Africa.\" The question is asking which development between 1450 and 1750 C.E. Rodney's argument is most likely responding to. The options are:\n\nA. The colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers\n\nB. The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World\n\nC. The spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa\n\nD. The importation of New World products into Africa\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Rodney is arguing in the passage. He says that the imperialist system is mostly responsible for Africa's economic underdevelopment because it drained African wealth and prevented the continent's resources from developing more quickly. He also mentions that the capitalists of Western Europe actively extended their exploitation from Europe to cover all of Africa.\n\nSo, Rodney is blaming the imperialist system and European capitalists for Africa's underdevelopment. Now, I need to see which of these developments from 1450 to 1750 C.E. this argument is responding to.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: The colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers.\n\nDuring the period from 1450 to 1750 C.E., European powers did establish colonies in Africa, but mostly along the coast. The interior of Africa was not extensively colonized until the late 19th century, which is after this period. So, while there was some colonization, it was primarily along the coast.\n\nOption B: The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World.\n\nThis refers to the forced migration of Africans to the Americas through the transatlantic slave trade. During the 15th to the 18th centuries, millions of Africans were enslaved and taken to the Americas to work on plantations and mines.\n\nOption C: The spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nWhile Christianity did spread into some parts of Africa during this period, it was mostly along the coast and in areas like Ethiopia. The interior of Africa was not extensively Christianized until the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nOption D: The importation of New World products into Africa.\n\nThis would involve products from the Americas being brought to Africa, such as maize, potatoes, tomatoes, etc. These crops did spread from the Americas to other parts of the world, including Africa, during the Columbian Exchange.\n\nNow, considering Rodney's argument about European imperialist exploitation and the draining of African wealth, which of these options aligns best with his critique?\n\nRodney is talking about European imperialist actions that exploited Africa and led to its underdevelopment. So, it's about European activities that had a direct economic impact on Africa.\n\nOption A suggests colonization of the interior, but as I thought earlier, colonization of the interior was more of a 19th-century phenomenon. During the 15th to 18th centuries, European presence in Africa was mostly limited to coastal trading posts and forts.\n\nOption B is about the African diaspora to the New World. This was a massive event during this period, with Europeans playing a central role in the transatlantic slave trade. This trade involved capturing Africans, transporting them to the Americas, and selling them as slaves. This had a devastating impact on African societies, depleting them of millions of people, including some of their most able-bodied and skilled individuals.\n\nOption C, the spread of Christianity, was more of a cultural and religious influence. While it had impacts, it wasn't directly about economic exploitation in the way Rodney is describing.\n\nOption D, the importation of New World products into Africa, involved bringing crops and possibly other goods from the Americas to Africa. While this had some impact on African agriculture and diet, it's not directly about European exploitation of African resources.\n\nRodney's argument is about European imperialist systems draining African wealth and preventing the development of African resources. The transatlantic slave trade, option B, fits into this because Europeans were directly involved in capturing and selling African people, which not only deprived Africa of its population but also enriched European economies through the profits from slavery and the production of cash crops in the Americas that were dependent on slave labor.\n\nMoreover, the slave trade was part of a larger system of trade and exploitation that included the exchange of goods, but the human cost was enormous, and the economic impact on Africa was severely negative.\n\nSo, considering this, I think option B is the most appropriate answer. The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World through the transatlantic slave trade was a development during the period 1450 to 1750 C.E. that Walter Rodney's argument in \"How Europe Underdeveloped Africa\" is most likely responding to.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Option A: Colonization of the interior was more of a 19th-century phenomenon.\n\n- Option C: Spread of Christianity was more cultural and religious, less directly related to economic exploitation.\n\n- Option D: Importation of New World products was more about introducing new crops and goods, not directly about European exploitation of African resources.\n\n- Option B: Transatlantic slave trade involved direct exploitation and depletion of African human resources by Europeans, fitting Rodney's critique of imperialist exploitation and underdevelopment of Africa.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
