                    "text": "Let's see. When I brush my hair, especially if it's dry outside, my hair can stand on end afterward. I think that's because of static electricity. So, when I brush my hair, the brush is scraping electrons from my hair, right? Hmm, but I need to remember what happens to the charge of my hair when electrons are scraped off.\n\nI know that electrons are negatively charged particles. So, if the brush is scraping electrons from my hair, that means my hair is losing electrons. Losing negative charges should make my hair positively charged because positive and negative charges balance each other. If I lose negatives, the positives dominate.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about this. Maybe I should think about it differently. Let's consider the process step by step.\n\nWhen I brush my hair, the brush and my hair interact frictionally. This friction can cause electrons to be transferred from one material to the other. The direction of electron transfer depends on the materials involved and their positions in the triboelectric series.\n\nAssuming that the brush is made of a material that attracts electrons more strongly than my hair, it would pull electrons from my hair, making my hair positively charged and the brush negatively charged.\n\nBut, I need to confirm if that's the case with my specific brush. My brush is probably made of plastic or nylon, which are common materials in hairbrushes. Hair is primarily composed of keratin, which is a protein.\n\nLooking back, I recall that nylon is higher in the triboelectric series than keratin. That means nylon tends to gain electrons when rubbed against keratin. So, when I brush my hair with a nylon brush, the nylon brush gains electrons (becoming negatively charged) and my hair loses electrons (becoming positively charged).\n\nThat makes sense because when my hair loses electrons, it becomes positively charged. That would explain why my hair stands on end after brushing, especially in dry air, because the positive charges repel each other, causing the hairs to stand apart.\n\nWait a minute, but I've also heard that sometimes hair can become negatively charged, especially if it's rubbed with certain materials. For example, if I rub my hair with a balloon, my hair might become negatively charged and the balloon positively charged, depending on the materials.\n\nBut in this question, it's specified that the brush is scraping electrons from my hair, implying that my hair is losing electrons and thus becoming positively charged.\n\nSo, based on this, the charge of my hair becomes positive.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another perspective. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nI know that in electrostatic interactions, when two different materials are rubbed together, electrons can be transferred from one to the other based on their affinity for electrons. The material higher in the triboelectric series will gain electrons and become negatively charged, while the lower one will lose electrons and become positively charged.\n\nGiven that, and assuming the brush is made of a material higher in the series than hair, like nylon, then yes, the brush gains electrons and hair loses them, making hair positively charged.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that in some conditions, such as high humidity, static electricity is less likely to build up because moisture in the air can dissipate the charge. But in dry conditions, like winter, static electricity is more pronounced, which is why hair might stand on end after brushing.\n\nAlso, I recall that synthetic fibers in clothing can also cause static cling for similar reasons, especially if they're higher in the triboelectric series than cotton or skin.\n\nSo, to sum it up, when I brush my hair and the brush scrapes electrons from my hair, my hair becomes positively charged.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. positive.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's think about a simple experiment I could perform. If I have a balloon and rub it on my hair, the balloon becomes negatively charged and my hair becomes positively charged, and they attract each other. But in this scenario, the brush is scraping electrons from my hair, which should have the same effect.\n\nWait, but the question says \"scrape electrons from your hair,\" which suggests that the brush is gaining electrons at the expense of my hair, making my hair positively charged.\n\nYes, that aligns with what I thought.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is A. positive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ positive}} \\]"
