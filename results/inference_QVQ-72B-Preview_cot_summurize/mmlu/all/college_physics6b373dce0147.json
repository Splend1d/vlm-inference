                    "text": "So I have this problem about a satellite orbiting a planet, and I need to figure out how the time for one revolution depends on the masses of the satellite and the planet, as well as the orbit radius. The options are given, but I want to understand why they are like that, not just pick one blindly.\n\nFirst, I remember that for circular orbits, there's a relationship between the orbital radius, the masses involved, and the period of orbit. Since it's a satellite orbiting a planet, I can assume that the planet is much more massive than the satellite, so maybe the mass of the satellite doesn't affect the orbit that much, but I need to verify that.\n\nI recall that for celestial bodies orbiting under gravity, Newton's law of universal gravitation comes into play. The gravitational force between the planet and the satellite provides the centripetal force needed for the orbital motion.\n\nSo, the gravitational force is:\n\n\\[F = G \\frac{M m}{R^2}\\]\n\nAnd the centripetal force is:\n\n\\[F = m R \\omega^2 = m R \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{T}\\right)^2\\]\n\nWhere \\(T\\) is the period of revolution, and \\(\\omega\\) is the angular velocity.\n\nSetting these equal:\n\n\\[G \\frac{M m}{R^2} = m R \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{T}\\right)^2\\]\n\nI can simplify this equation to find \\(T\\).\n\nFirst, divide both sides by \\(m\\) (since \\(m \\neq 0\\)):\n\n\\[G \\frac{M}{R^2} = R \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{T}\\right)^2\\]\n\nThen, solve for \\(T^2\\):\n\n\\[T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 R^3}{G M}\\]\n\nSo, \\(T\\) is proportional to \\(R^{3/2}\\) and inversely proportional to \\(\\sqrt{M}\\).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. independent of M\n\nBut from the equation, \\(T\\) depends on \\(M\\), so this can't be right.\n\nB. proportional to \\(m^{1/2}\\)\n\nFrom the derivation, \\(T\\) doesn't depend on \\(m\\), so this is incorrect.\n\nC. linear in R\n\nNo, \\(T\\) is proportional to \\(R^{3/2}\\), not linearly to \\(R\\).\n\nD. proportional to \\(R^{3/2}\\)\n\nYes, this matches the derived relationship.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says \"the time required for one revolution is\"\n\nLet me check again.\n\nFrom the equation \\(T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 R^3}{G M}\\), taking square roots:\n\n\\[T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{R^3}{G M}}\\]\n\nSo, \\(T\\) is indeed proportional to \\(R^{3/2}\\) and inversely proportional to \\(\\sqrt{M}\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. proportional to \\(R^{3/2}\\).\n\nBut let's see if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nIs \\(T\\) independent of \\(m\\)? From the equation, it seems so, which aligns with option B being incorrect.\n\nOption A says independent of \\(M\\), but \\(T\\) depends on \\(M\\), so that's wrong.\n\nOption C says linear in \\(R\\), but it's \\(R^{3/2}\\), which is not linear.\n\nOption D matches our derivation.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. proportional to \\(R^{3/2}\\).\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there are any other factors that could influence this.\n\nIs the mass of the satellite \\(m\\) relevant? In more advanced treatments, maybe both masses affect the orbit, but in the ideal case where the planet is much more massive, the satellite's mass should cancel out, which it did in our derivation.\n\nAlso, is the orbit perfectly circular? The problem states it's a circular orbit, so yes, that's a safe assumption.\n\nTherefore, the time for one revolution is proportional to \\(R^{3/2}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
