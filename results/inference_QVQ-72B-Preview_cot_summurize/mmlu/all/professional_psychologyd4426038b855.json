Let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what's being asked. It's about recognizing objects through touch, which is called tactile recognition or stereognosis. So, if someone can't do that, it means there's an issue somewhere in the brain that processes touch information.\n\nOkay, let's think about where in the brain touch is processed. I remember that the somatosensory cortex is involved in processing touch sensations. That's in the parietal lobe, right? So, the parietal cortex might be a good candidate.\n\nBut let's consider each option:\n\nA. Medulla oblongata: This is part of the brainstem, involved in autonomic functions like heart rate and breathing. I don't recall it being directly involved in touch recognition.\n\nB. Corpus callosum: This is the bundle of neural fibers that connects the left and right hemispheres of the brain. Damage here might affect communication between hemispheres, but I'm not sure if that would specifically cause problems with recognizing objects by touch.\n\nC. Parietal cortex: As I thought earlier, this is where somatosensory information is processed. If this area is damaged, it could affect the ability to interpret touch sensations, including recognizing objects.\n\nD. Pons: This is also part of the brainstem, involved in sleep cycles, respiration, and other automatic functions. Again, not directly related to touch recognition.\n\nSo, based on this, the parietal cortex seems the most likely answer. But just to be sure, maybe I should look up some references or recall if there are any specific syndromes or conditions that involve loss of tactile recognition due to brain damage.\n\nI recall that astereognosis is the inability to recognize objects by touch, and it's often associated with damage to the parietal lobe, particularly the somatosensory cortex. So, that aligns with my initial thought.\n\nLet me consider if there's any reason to think otherwise. For example, could damage to the corpus callosum affect tactile recognition? Well, the corpus callosum connects the two hemispheres, and if one hemisphere processes touch information, maybe disrupting communication could affect recognition. But I think the parietal cortex is more directly involved in the processing of touch information.\n\nSimilarly, the medulla oblongata and pons are more involved in regulatory functions, not directly in sensory processing related to touch recognition.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is the parietal cortex.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
