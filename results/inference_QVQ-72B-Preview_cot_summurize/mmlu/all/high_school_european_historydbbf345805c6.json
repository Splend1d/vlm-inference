                    "text": "So I've got this passage about the Paris Exposition of 1889 and how it was a big deal for anthropologists. It talks about all these opportunities to study \"the natural history of man\" in Paris during that time, especially in August when lots of conferences and the French Association were meeting. The passage lists places like the Mus\u00e9e and Laboratoire Broca, Bertillon's anthropometric operations, lectures at the \u00e9cole d'Anthropologie, collections at the Jardin de Plantes, and research opportunities in medical schools and hospitals. All these places seem to be important for anthropologists and comparative anatomists.\n\nNow, the question is asking about when this field, which I assume is anthropology, was born. It gives four options, and I need to pick the correct one based on the information in the passage.\n\nOption A says that anthropology was born when scientific societies needed new ways of attracting members who were less interested in the study of the natural world. Hmm, that seems a bit contradictory because anthropology is about the study of humans, which is part of the natural world. So, if people were less interested in the natural world, why would creating a field that studies humans, which is part of the natural world, attract them? Maybe I'm missing something here, but this option doesn't seem to make a lot of sense in the context of the passage.\n\nOption B says that anthropology was born when there was a sudden interest in expanding human rights throughout the French colonies. The passage mentions the Paris Exposition of 1889, which was a time when France had a large empire, including colonies in Africa and Asia. But the passage doesn't directly talk about human rights or any sudden interest in expanding them. It's more about scientific study and research opportunities in anthropology. So, this option doesn't seem to align well with the information provided.\n\nOption C says that anthropology was born when scientific principles were applied to other cultures as a result of the sudden expansion of European dominance across large parts of the globe. Now, this seems more relevant. The passage mentions the Mus\u00e9e and Laboratoire Broca, which are likely involved in scientific studies of humans, and Bertillon's anthropometric operations, which sound like measurements of human physical characteristics. This seems to align with applying scientific methods to understand different cultures and peoples, especially given the context of European expansion in the 19th century.\n\nOption D says that anthropology was born when there was a large influx of immigrants from Africa and Asia arrived in Europe. While it's possible that immigration could spark interest in studying different cultures, the passage doesn't mention anything about immigration. It's focused on scientific institutions and opportunities in Paris during the Exposition, not on population movements.\n\nBased on the information in the passage, option C seems to be the most fitting answer. It refers to the application of scientific principles to other cultures, which aligns with the focus on anthropological studies and the expansion of European influence globally during that period.\n\nBut let me double-check. The passage mentions \"the natural history of man,\" which is a key phrase. Anthropology is the study of humans, including their cultures, societies, and biological characteristics. The institutions listed, like the Mus\u00e9e and Laboratoire Broca and Bertillon's anthropometric operations, suggest a focus on both cultural and physical aspects of humans, which fits with the scientific study of other cultures as a result of European expansion.\n\nAdditionally, the Paris Exposition of 1889 was a world fair that showcased technological and cultural achievements, and it was held to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. Given the timing and context, it was a period when European powers were actively engaged in imperialist endeavors, exploring and colonizing parts of Africa and Asia. This expansion would have brought European scientists into contact with a wide variety of cultures and peoples, providing ample opportunity for scientific study and analysis.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the correct choice, as it reflects the application of scientific principles to the study of other cultures, which was a significant factor in the development of anthropology as a field during the time of European imperial expansion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
