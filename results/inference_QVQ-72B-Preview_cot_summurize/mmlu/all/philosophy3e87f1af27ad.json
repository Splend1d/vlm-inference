                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about Moore's philosophy. It says, \"According to Moore, we are thinking about good whenever we think about:\n\nA. pleasure.\n\nB. things that we desire.\n\nC. intrinsic value.\n\nD. none of the above.\"\n\nAlright, I need to recall what Moore thought about the concept of \"good.\" I remember that G. E. Moore was an ethical non-naturalist, which means he believed that \"good\" is not the same as any natural property like pleasure or desire satisfaction.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, Moore is famous for his \"open question argument,\" which suggests that no naturalistic property can fully capture the meaning of \"good.\" So, if someone says that \"good\" is the same as \"pleasure,\" Moore would argue that we can always ask whether pleasure is good, making the definition not fully capturing the concept of good.\n\nSo, according to Moore, \"good\" is a simple, indefinable quality that can't be reduced to anything else. It's what he calls an \"intrinsic value.\"\n\nWait a minute, but option C is \"intrinsic value.\" Is that correct?\n\nI recall that Moore did use the term \"intrinsic value\" to refer to something that is good in itself, not because of anything else it brings about. So, in a way, when we think about intrinsic value, we are thinking about good.\n\nBut let's be careful. Moore might have distinguished between \"good\" and \"intrinsic value\" in some specific ways. Maybe \"good\" is a property that something has intrinsically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he considered \"good\" to be synonymous with \"intrinsic value.\"\n\nLet me consider some examples. If something has intrinsic value, it's good in itself. So, according to Moore, when we say something is good, we're pointing to this intrinsic quality it has.\n\nTherefore, when we think about good, we're thinking about intrinsic value.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Is there a difference between \"good\" and \"intrinsic value\" in Moore's philosophy?\n\nI think in Moore's ethics, he considered \"good\" to be a fundamental property that some things have intrinsically. So, in that case, \"intrinsic value\" would be closely related to \"good.\"\n\nLet me consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is pleasure. As I mentioned earlier, Moore would argue that pleasure is not identical to good because pleasure is a natural property, and good is a non-natural, indefinable property.\n\nSimilarly, option B is things that we desire. Moore would likely say that what we desire is not necessarily good. Desires can be for good things or bad things, so desirability doesn't define goodness.\n\nTherefore, both A and B are incorrect according to Moore's view.\n\nOption D is \"none of the above,\" which seems unlikely given that C seems plausible.\n\nSo, my best answer is C. intrinsic value.\n\nBut to double-check, let's consider if there's any other perspective within Moore's philosophy that might suggest otherwise.\n\nMoore talked about \"good\" as being a simple, non-analyzable quality. He believed that we can intuit what is good through moral intuition. So, when we think about good, we're directly apprehending this quality, which is intrinsic to certain things.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense that when we think about good, we're thinking about intrinsic value.\n\nI think C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
