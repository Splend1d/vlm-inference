                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this accounting problem about Dash Co.'s utility bills. I need to find out how much they should report as a liability on their June 30 balance sheet. Let's go through the information step by step.\n\nFirst, there are three utility bills listed, each covering a specific period and with a specified amount, and they're paid on certain dates. Here they are:\n\n1. Period covered: April 16 to May 15\n   Amount: $5,000\n   Date paid: June 1\n\n2. Period covered: May 16 to June 15\n   Amount: $6,000\n   Date paid: July 1\n\n3. Period covered: June 16 to July 15\n   Amount: $8,000\n   Date paid: August 1\n\nAnd the question is, what is the amount that Dash should report as a liability in its June 30 balance sheet?\n\nOkay, so to understand this, I need to recall what a liability represents in accounting. Liabilities are obligations that a company owes, whether in terms of money or services, that need to be paid in the future.\n\nIn this case, since we're dealing with utility bills, each bill represents the cost of utilities used during a specific period. The payment for these bills is made after the period they cover, which makes sense because utilities are typically paid based on usage over a past period.\n\nNow, the balance sheet is a snapshot of the company's financial position at a particular point in time. In this problem, that point in time is June 30.\n\nSo, I need to determine what utility costs have been incurred but not yet paid as of June 30.\n\nLet's look at each bill:\n\n1. The first bill covers April 16 to May 15 and was paid on June 1 for $5,000.\n\nSince this bill was paid on June 1, it should have already been recorded as an expense and paid off by June 30. So, this shouldn't create any liability as of June 30.\n\n2. The second bill covers May 16 to June 15 and is to be paid on July 1 for $6,000.\n\nThis bill was for the period May 16 to June 15, and it's due to be paid on July 1. Since the payment is after June 30, this means that as of June 30, Dash still owes this amount. Therefore, this should be recorded as a liability on the June 30 balance sheet.\n\n3. The third bill covers June 16 to July 15 and is to be paid on August 1 for $8,000.\n\nSimilarly, this bill covers the period from June 16 to July 15 and is due to be paid on August 1. Since June 30 is before August 1, this amount is also still owed by Dash as of June 30 and should be recorded as a liability.\n\nSo, adding up the amounts of the second and third bills: $6,000 + $8,000 = $14,000.\n\nBut wait a minute, let's make sure there isn't any overlap or something I'm missing.\n\nThe first bill covers April 16 to May 15 and was paid on June 1, so that's taken care of.\n\nThe second bill covers May 16 to June 15 and is unpaid as of June 30.\n\nThe third bill covers June 16 to July 15 and is also unpaid as of June 30.\n\nSo, the total liability should indeed be the sum of the second and third bills, which is $14,000.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. $6,000\n\nB. $7,000\n\nC. $10,000\n\nD. $14,000\n\nIt seems like $14,000 is one of the options, so according to my calculation, that should be the answer.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's any trick here.\n\nIs there any possibility that part of the utility cost might have been prepaid or that there's a different accounting treatment I should consider?\n\nLet me think about accrual accounting. In accrual accounting, expenses are matched to the period in which they are incurred, regardless of when they are paid.\n\nSo, for the period covered by the bill, the expense should be recognized in the period it was incurred, and the liability should be recorded if it hasn't been paid yet.\n\nGiven that, the bills for May 16 to June 15 and June 16 to July 15 are unpaid as of June 30, so the total liability should be the sum of these two bills.\n\nWait a second, perhaps there's something about the timing that I'm missing.\n\nLet me consider the periods again:\n\n- April 16 to May 15: paid on June 1 ($5,000)\n\n- May 16 to June 15: paid on July 1 ($6,000)\n\n- June 16 to July 15: paid on August 1 ($8,000)\n\nAs of June 30, the bill for April 16 to May 15 has been paid on June 1, so no liability remains for that period.\n\nThe bill for May 16 to June 15 is unpaid as of June 30, so that's $6,000 liability.\n\nThe bill for June 16 to July 15 is also unpaid as of June 30, so that's another $8,000 liability.\n\nTherefore, total liability is $6,000 + $8,000 = $14,000.\n\nAgain, that points to option D.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any proration or partial periods that might affect this.\n\nFor example, since June 30 is the end of the month, and the bill for June 16 to July 15 covers a period that starts after June 30, perhaps there's some prepaid portion.\n\nWait, the bill for June 16 to July 15 covers from June 16 onward, which includes June 16 to June 30, a portion of which has been incurred by June 30.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to prorate the $8,000 bill based on the days in June.\n\nLet me calculate the number of days from June 16 to June 30.\n\nJune has 30 days, so from June 16 to June 30 is 15 days.\n\nThe total bill period is from June 16 to July 15, which is 30 days.\n\nSo, the portion of the bill for June 16 to June 30 is 15 days out of 30 days, which is half of the bill.\n\nTherefore, the liability for the June 16 to July 15 bill as of June 30 would be half of $8,000, which is $4,000.\n\nWait a minute, that changes things.\n\nSo, if the $8,000 bill covers 30 days from June 16 to July 15, and as of June 30, only 15 days have been used (June 16 to June 30), then perhaps only half of the $8,000 should be recognized as a liability, and the other half would be prepaid.\n\nBut I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire $8,000 should be recognized as a liability since the entire bill period is from June 16 to July 15, and none of it has been paid yet.\n\nBut if that's the case, why would we prorate it?\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about it differently.\n\nLet's consider that the utility bill for June 16 to July 15 is $8,000, and it's paid on August 1.\n\nAs of June 30, Dash has used utilities from June 16 to June 30, which is 15 days, and the remaining 15 days (July 1 to July 15) haven't been used yet.\n\nSo, perhaps only the portion for June 16 to June 30 should be recognized as a liability, and the remaining portion for July 1 to July 15 should be recorded as a prepaid expense.\n\nIf that's the case, then the liability for the June 16 to July 15 bill would be $4,000, not $8,000.\n\nSimilarly, the prepaid expense would also be $4,000 for the unused portion in July.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about this approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in accounting practice, the entire bill is recognized as a liability when it's incurred, and when it's paid, it's reduced.\n\nBut given that the payment is after the usage period, it's likely that the liability is recognized for the full amount when the usage occurs.\n\nHowever, since the bill covers a full month, and payment is made one month after the end of the billing period, perhaps the entire $8,000 should be recognized as a liability.\n\nBut considering that, as of June 30, only half of the billing period has been used, maybe it's appropriate to recognize only half as a liability.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing.\n\nLet me try to look up how to handle utilities in accounting.\n\nIn general, utilities are expensed in the period they are used, and a liability is recognized for the amount owed but not yet paid.\n\nIf a bill covers a period that spans two accounting periods, the liability should be apportioned accordingly.\n\nIn this case, the bill for June 16 to July 15 is for $8,000, and it's paid on August 1.\n\nAs of June 30, the usage from June 16 to June 30 should be recognized as an expense and a liability for the corresponding amount.\n\nThe portion from July 1 to July 15 would not have been used yet, so perhaps it shouldn't be recognized as a liability yet.\n\nTherefore, only half of the $8,000, which is $4,000, should be recognized as a liability as of June 30.\n\nAdding that to the $6,000 liability for the May 16 to June 15 bill, the total liability would be $6,000 + $4,000 = $10,000.\n\nWait, but that's option C.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was $14,000.\n\nNow, I'm confused.\n\nLet me see another perspective.\n\nPerhaps the entire $8,000 should be recognized as a liability since the entire bill period is from June 16 to July 15, and none of it has been paid yet.\n\nBut then, the $6,000 bill for May 16 to June 15 is also unpaid.\n\nSo, total liability would be $6,000 + $8,000 = $14,000.\n\nBut if I consider that the $8,000 bill includes some portion that hasn't been used yet (July 1 to July 15), maybe only the used portion should be recognized as a liability.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nLet me try to think about it in terms of accruals.\n\nAs of June 30, Dash has used utilities from May 16 to June 15 and June 16 to June 30.\n\nThe bill for May 16 to June 15 is $6,000 and is unpaid.\n\nThe bill for June 16 to July 15 is $8,000 and is unpaid.\n\nTherefore, the total liability should be $6,000 + $8,000 = $14,000.\n\nBut if I consider that the $8,000 bill includes July usage, which hasn't happened yet, perhaps only half should be recognized now, and the other half in July.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire $8,000 should be recognized as a liability, and when July comes, the prepaid portion will be adjusted.\n\nI'm still unsure.\n\nLet me look for a general rule.\n\nIn accounting, when a bill covers a period that spans two accounting periods, the liability is recognized for the portion that has been used.\n\nSo, for the June 16 to July 15 bill, only the portion from June 16 to June 30 should be recognized as a liability as of June 30.\n\nGiven that the billing period is 30 days, and 15 days have been used by June 30, the liability would be $8,000 * (15/30) = $4,000.\n\nAdding that to the $6,000 liability for the May 16 to June 15 bill, the total liability is $6,000 + $4,000 = $10,000.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. $10,000.\n\nBut I need to make sure.\n\nLet me see another way.\n\nIf I consider that the $8,000 bill is for 30 days, and each day's cost is $8,000 / 30 \u2248 $266.67 per day.\n\nFrom June 16 to June 30, that's 15 days, so 15 * $266.67 \u2248 $4,000.\n\nSo, again, $4,000 liability for the June 16 to June 30 portion.\n\nPlus the $6,000 for the May 16 to June 15 bill, which is fully used by June 30, total liability is $10,000.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. $10,000.\n\nI think the initial thought of adding $6,000 + $8,000 = $14,000 is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that part of the $8,000 bill is for future usage in July, which hasn't occurred yet as of June 30.\n\nSo, prorating the $8,000 bill based on the days used in June makes sense.\n\nHence, the correct choice is C. $10,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
