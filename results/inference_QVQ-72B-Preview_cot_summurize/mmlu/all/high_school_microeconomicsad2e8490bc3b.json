                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to figure out which of these statements correctly illustrates why price equals marginal revenue under perfect competition and why price is greater than marginal revenue under monopoly or imperfect competition.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what perfect competition and imperfect competition are. Perfect competition is a market structure where there are many buyers and sellers, all selling identical products, and no single firm can influence the market price. Because of this, each firm in perfect competition faces a perfectly elastic demand curve, which means they can sell as much as they want at the prevailing market price. So, for each additional unit sold, the marginal revenue is equal to the price.\n\nOn the other hand, in imperfect competition, which includes monopolies and monopolistic competition, firms face downward-sloping demand curves because they have some market power and can influence the price by adjusting their output. As a result, to sell more units, they have to lower the price, which affects the marginal revenue. Marginal revenue is the additional revenue from selling one more unit, and in this case, it's less than the price because selling that extra unit requires lowering the price for all units sold.\n\nSo, statement I says MR = P = demand on a horizontal function for perfect competition. That sounds right because in perfect competition, the demand curve faced by the firm is horizontal (perfectly elastic), and both MR and P are equal to the market price.\n\nStatement II says P > MR as downward-sloping functions for imperfect competition. That also seems correct because in imperfect competition, the demand curve is downward-sloping, and MR is less than P.\n\nStatement III says demand and price are represented as a vertical function for imperfect competition. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. In imperfect competition, the demand curve is downward-sloping, which is not vertical. A vertical demand curve would imply that quantity demanded doesn't change with price, which isn't typical for imperfect competition. Actually, in perfect competition, the demand curve faced by the firm is horizontal, not vertical.\n\nSo, based on this, statements I and II seem correct, but statement III is not.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. I, II, and III.\n\nB. I and II.\n\nC. I only.\n\nD. I and III.\n\nSince I and II are correct and III is not, the answer should be B. I and II.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing about vertical demand curves in imperfect competition.\n\nIn imperfect competition, like monopoly, the demand curve is downward-sloping but not vertical. It's true that the firm can set its price above marginal cost, but the demand curve still allows for some relationship between price and quantity demanded. A vertical demand curve would suggest that quantity demanded is fixed regardless of price, which isn't the case in imperfect competition.\n\nTherefore, statement III is incorrect because in imperfect competition, the demand curve is downward-sloping, not vertical.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. I and II.\n\nWait a minute, but looking back at the options, option A includes III, which we've determined is incorrect. Option B includes I and II, which we've confirmed as correct. Option C is just I, but we need both I and II. Option D includes I and III, but III is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. I and II.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
