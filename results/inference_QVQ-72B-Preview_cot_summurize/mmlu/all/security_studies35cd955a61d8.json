Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that transnational crime developed because of declining defense spending and the reduction of armies, which reduced the risk of activities. Hmm, that seems a bit counterintuitive. If defense spending decreases and armies are stood down, you might think that there's less capacity to fight crime, but does that directly lead to the expansion of transnational crime? Maybe indirectly, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I need to think about this differently.\n\nOption B mentions that TNC emerged in the academic sphere related to human security concerns and developmental opportunities in weak states as a means of conflict resolution and peace building in Europe. This sounds more theoretical and less about the actual expansion of crime. It seems like it's talking about how the concept was understood or studied, not necessarily what caused its expansion in reality. So, perhaps this isn't the direct answer to the question.\n\nOption C states that transnational criminal activities have always been around, and the growth of interest in TNC is due to better intelligence and communications technology, which allows us to see the full extent of the problem. This makes sense because with improved technology, we can detect and understand more about these crimes. However, does the improvement in technology directly enable the expansion of transnational crime, or does it just help us see what's already there? Maybe it's a bit of both, but I think it's more about revealing what's happening rather than causing the expansion.\n\nOption D suggests that international trends like globalization may have unintentionally created new opportunities for transnational crime to grow. This resonates with me. Globalization involves increased connectivity, trade, and movement of people, which can make it easier for criminals to operate across borders. So, perhaps the expansion of transnational crime in the 1990s was facilitated by the accelerating process of globalization.\n\nLet me summarize my thoughts:\n\n- Option A: Decreased defense spending might create some vulnerabilities, but it's not clearly linked to the expansion of transnational crime.\n\n- Option B: This seems more about the academic understanding of TNC rather than the actual expansion of crime activities.\n\n- Option C: Better technology helps us understand the scope of the problem, but it's not necessarily the driving force behind the expansion of crime.\n\n- Option D: Globalization creating new spaces and opportunities for criminals seems plausible.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think Option D is the most accurate answer. International trends like globalization likely enabled the expansion of transnational crime in the 1990s by opening up new spaces and opportunities for criminal activities to flourish across borders.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
