                    "text": "So I'm looking at this problem about Skytop Co., a nonprofit, considering buying a machine for $80,000. It's going to generate cash inflows of $25,000 each year for four years. They use discounted cash flows with a 10% cost of capital to evaluate projects. There's a table provided with some future and present value factors for four years at 10%, and there are four options to choose from, each suggesting whether to acquire the machine or not, based on different calculations.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what they're asking. They want to know whether Skytop should acquire the machine based on the net present value (NPV) calculation using the given factors. The options provide different reasons and NPV values, so I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nI recall that NPV is the sum of the present values of all future cash flows minus the initial investment. If NPV is positive, the project is considered acceptable because it's expected to add value to the organization. If it's negative, it's not advisable to proceed because the project would subtract value.\n\nGiven that Skytop is a nonprofit, they might have different objectives, but in financial terms, they still need to ensure that their investments are worthwhile and generate enough return to cover the cost of capital.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\n- Future value of $1 for 4 years at 10%: $1.464\n\n- Present value of $1 for 4 years at 10%: $0.683\n\n- Future value of $1 ordinary annuity for 4 years at 10%: $4.641\n\n- Present value of $1 ordinary annuity for 4 years at 10%: $3.170\n\nI think the most relevant factor here is the present value of an ordinary annuity for four years at 10%, which is $3.170. Since the cash inflows are uniform each year, this is essentially an annuity.\n\nLet me calculate the present value of the cash inflows.\n\nThe annual cash inflow is $25,000, and the present value factor for an annuity of $1 per year for four years at 10% is $3.170. So, the present value of the cash inflows would be:\n\nPresent value of inflows = $25,000 * 3.170 = $79,250\n\nNow, the initial investment is $80,000. So, the NPV would be:\n\nNPV = Present value of inflows - Initial investment = $79,250 - $80,000 = -$750\n\nSince the NPV is negative, it suggests that the machine acquisition is not financially favorable. It would lead to a loss of $750.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Yes Net cash flow is $20,000\n\nB. Yes Net future value is $36,025\n\nC. No Net present value is ($750)\n\nD. No Net present value is ($8,750)\n\nOption C seems to align with my calculation: NPV is -$750, and it advises not to acquire the machine.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirm the present value factor for the annuity. Using the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity:\n\nPV = C * [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r\n\nWhere:\n\n- C = cash flow per period ($25,000)\n\n- r = discount rate (10% or 0.10)\n\n- n = number of periods (4 years)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nPV = $25,000 * [1 - (1 + 0.10)^-4] / 0.10\n\nCalculate (1 + 0.10)^-4:\n\n(1.10)^-4 = 1 / (1.10)^4 \u2248 1 / 1.4641 \u2248 0.683 (which matches the given present value of $1)\n\nSo,\n\nPV = $25,000 * (1 - 0.683) / 0.10\n\nPV = $25,000 * (0.317) / 0.10\n\nPV = $25,000 * 3.170 \u2248 $79,250\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, initial investment is $80,000, so NPV = $79,250 - $80,000 = -$750.\n\nSo, option C seems correct.\n\nBut let's look at option D: No Net present value is ($8,750)\n\nWhere does $8,750 come from? Maybe there's a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they're using a different approach, like calculating the net future value.\n\nLooking at option B: Yes Net future value is $36,025\n\nWait, but the question mentions discounted cash flows, which typically involve present values, not future values. Maybe there's confusion between present and future values.\n\nLet me consider calculating the future value of the cash inflows and compare it to the initial investment.\n\nFirst, find the future value of the annuity.\n\nFuture value of an ordinary annuity = C * [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r\n\nWhere:\n\n- C = $25,000\n\n- r = 0.10\n\n- n = 4\n\nFuture value = $25,000 * [(1.10)^4 - 1] / 0.10\n\nCalculate (1.10)^4:\n\n(1.10)^4 = 1.4641\n\nSo,\n\nFuture value = $25,000 * (1.4641 - 1) / 0.10\n\n= $25,000 * (0.4641) / 0.10\n\n= $25,000 * 4.641 \u2248 $116,025\n\nNow, the initial investment is $80,000. So, the net future value would be $116,025 - $80,000 = $36,025\n\nWait, that matches option B: Yes Net future value is $36,025\n\nBut the problem is about NPV, not net future value. Maybe there's confusion in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they're considering the net cash flow over the four years without discounting.\n\nTotal cash inflow over four years: $25,000 * 4 = $100,000\n\nInitial investment: $80,000\n\nNet cash flow: $100,000 - $80,000 = $20,000\n\nWhich matches option A: Yes Net cash flow is $20,000\n\nBut this doesn't account for the time value of money, which is why we use NPV.\n\nPerhaps the options are intended to represent different perspectives, but the problem specifies discounted cash flows.\n\nGiven that, the correct choice should be C: No Net present value is ($750)\n\nBecause the NPV is negative, indicating the project doesn't cover its cost sufficiently considering the time value of money.\n\nBut to ensure, let's consider another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're calculating the present value using the present value of $1 factors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the NPV calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate NPV using the formula.\n\nNPV = -Initial investment + \u03a3 [Cash flow_t / (1 + r)^t ]\n\nWhere t = 1 to 4\n\nSo,\n\nNPV = -$80,000 + $25,000 / 1.10 + $25,000 / (1.10)^2 + $25,000 / (1.10)^3 + $25,000 / (1.10)^4\n\nCalculate each term:\n\nYear 1: $25,000 / 1.10 \u2248 $22,727.27\n\nYear 2: $25,000 / 1.21 \u2248 $20,661.06\n\nYear 3: $25,000 / 1.331 \u2248 $18,782.73\n\nYear 4: $25,000 / 1.4641 \u2248 $17,061.96\n\nSum of present values of cash flows: $22,727.27 + $20,661.06 + $18,782.73 + $17,061.96 \u2248 $79,233\n\nNPV = $79,233 - $80,000 \u2248 -$767\n\nHmm, slightly different from earlier calculation due to rounding.\n\nBut still approximately -$750.\n\nSo, NPV is negative, meaning the project shouldn't be accepted.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: No Net present value is ($750)\n\nOption D suggests NPV is -$8,750, which doesn't match my calculation.\n\nOption B mentions net future value, which is different from NPV.\n\nOption A considers only the net cash flow without discounting.\n\nHence, C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
