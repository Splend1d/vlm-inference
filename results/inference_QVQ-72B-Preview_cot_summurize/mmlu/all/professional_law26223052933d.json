                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a furniture dealer and a young couple with less than perfect credit. The couple bought some furniture on account, and there's a contract that says if they buy new items, they don't own the old purchases until the new ones are paid off. This provision was in fine print on the back of the papers. Then, the husband lost his job, and by that time, they had paid for everything except for one chair they bought a few weeks earlier. The store is suing to repossess all the furniture ever sold to the couple. The question is, will the couple likely prevail on a defense of unconscionability?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what unconscionability means. Unconscionability is a legal doctrine that allows courts to set aside contracts or contract terms that are so unfair to one party that they are deemed unconscionable or grossly unfair. It's often applied in cases where there is a significant imbalance in bargaining power between the parties, leading to terms that are oppressive or unfairly one-sided.\n\nIn this scenario, the couple has less than perfect credit, which might make it harder for them to negotiate favorable terms or find other furniture dealers willing to extend credit. The furniture dealer, knowing their credit situation, might have an upper hand in setting the terms of the contract.\n\nThe contract has a provision in fine print on the reverse side that says if the couple purchases new items on the account, they don't own the old purchases until the new ones are paid in full. This seems pretty harsh. It means that even if they've paid for most of their purchases, as long as there's a new item on the account that hasn't been paid off, the dealer can claim ownership of all previous purchases.\n\nNow, the husband lost his job, and they couldn't pay for the last chair they bought. The store is trying to repossess all the furniture they've ever sold to the couple, even though most of it has already been paid for.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because they might be able to find another store to sell them furniture, which proves that there was no lack of bargaining power.\n\nWell, just because they might find another store doesn't necessarily mean there was no lack of bargaining power. If their credit is less than perfect, they might have limited options for financing furniture. So, this doesn't seem like a strong argument against unconscionability.\n\nB. No, because the store was nice enough to extend credit, and the couple should be expected to pay for everything before they own any of it.\n\nThis seems like a weak argument. Just because the store extended credit doesn't mean the terms can't be unconscionable. In fact, the terms might be overly harsh and unfair, especially if they allow the store to repossess all previously paid items based on the non-payment of a single new item.\n\nC. Yes, because any time a seller puts terms in fine print it is proof of bad faith and unconscionability.\n\nThis seems too broad. Not all fine print is unconscionable. However, fine print can be indicative of an attempt to hide important terms, which might contribute to a finding of unconscionability, especially if those terms are particularly onerous.\n\nD. Yes, because a combination of factors makes it likely that the court will recognize unconscionability under these circumstances.\n\nThis seems plausible. There are several factors at play here that could lead a court to find the contract terms unconscionable:\n\n1. The couple has less than perfect credit, which might have limited their bargaining power.\n\n2. The provision is in fine print on the reverse side, which suggests it might not have been brought to their attention in a clear manner.\n\n3. The provision is overly harsh, allowing the store to repossess all furniture, including items that have been fully paid for, based on the non-payment of a single new item.\n\n4. The husband lost his job, which is a circumstance beyond their control, and yet the store is trying to take back everything.\n\nThese factors combined might lead a court to conclude that the contract terms are so unfair that they should be set aside.\n\nBut wait, let's think about this more carefully. Unconscionability typically involves both procedural and substantive elements. Procedural unconscionability relates to the process of forming the contract, such as unequal bargaining power or inadequate notice of terms. Substantive unconscionability relates to the fairness of the contract terms themselves.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- Procedural unconscionability: The couple has less than perfect credit, which might indicate they had limited negotiating power. The provision is in fine print on the back of the papers, which suggests they may not have been adequately informed about its terms.\n\n- Substantive unconscionability: The provision allows the store to repossess all furniture, including fully paid items, if a new purchase is not paid off. This seems disproportionate and overly harsh, especially if the new purchase is a small item like a chair.\n\nAdditionally, the store is trying to repossess all furniture based on the non-payment of one chair. If the couple had already paid for most of their purchases, it seems unfair to lose everything over one unpaid item.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether this provision is standard in such contracts or if it's an unusually harsh term. Some contracts have cross-collateralization clauses where new purchases secure the old debts, but I'm not sure if this is common practice in furniture sales.\n\nAlso, the fact that the provision is on the reverse side in fine print might make it difficult for the couple to claim they were unaware of it, but it still indicates that it wasn't prominently displayed.\n\nLet me consider some possible counterarguments:\n\n- The couple signed the contract, so they agreed to the terms, including the fine print.\n\n- The store was taking a risk by extending credit to a couple with less than perfect credit, so they have a right to protect their interests with such provisions.\n\n- The couple should have read the contract carefully before signing.\n\nWhile these points are valid, they don't necessarily negate the possibility of unconscionability. Courts often look at whether the terms are so unfair that they shock the conscience, regardless of whether the party signed the contract.\n\nMoreover, if the terms are adhesive\u2014meaning they are take-it-or-leave-it terms imposed by the stronger party\u2014the court may be more inclined to find unconscionability.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the provision is necessary to balance the risks between the parties. If the store is extending credit to someone with a higher risk of default, they might need stronger safeguards. However, allowing them to repossess all furniture, including fully paid items, for the non-payment of a single new item seems excessive.\n\nPerhaps there are laws in some jurisdictions that regulate such practices, limiting the ability of creditors to repossess fully paid items when new purchases are not paid off.\n\nI should also consider the principle of good faith and fair dealing in contracts. Even if the term is part of the contract, if enforcing it would be unfair or in bad faith, a court might refuse to enforce it.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the provision is in fine print might make it harder for the store to enforce it, as they may not have adequately disclosed it to the couple.\n\nLet me think about similar cases. In the case of Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc., the California Supreme Court discussed unconscionability in the context of employment arbitration agreements. They noted that unconscionability requires both procedural and substantive unconscionability, and that a clause may be unconscionable if it imposes significant costs on one party but imposes no corresponding benefits or only trivial ones on the other party.\n\nIn this scenario, the provision imposes significant risk on the couple by allowing the store to repossess all furniture, including fully paid items, for the non-payment of a single new item. The benefit to the store is protection against default, but this seems disproportionate.\n\nAnother relevant case is Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co., where the court considered whether a conditional sales contract that allowed the seller to repossess all goods upon default, even if some had been fully paid for, was enforceable. The court held that such clauses were enforceable because they provided security for the unpaid balance.\n\nHowever, in that case, the court also noted that the buyer had the option to pay off the balance to regain possession of the repossessed goods. In this problem, the couple had already paid for most of their purchases, and the store is trying to repossess everything based on the non-payment of one chair.\n\nPerhaps the couple could argue that they should only lose the chair that hasn't been paid for, and not all the other furniture they've already paid for.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the husband lost his job might be relevant as it shows a change in circumstances that was beyond their control.\n\nBut, generally, courts are reluctant to rewrite contract terms based on changes in circumstances, unless the terms are unconscionable.\n\nSo, balancing all these factors, it seems likely that the court would consider the provision unconscionable under these circumstances.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Yes, because a combination of factors makes it likely that the court will recognize unconscionability under these circumstances.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
