                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. It's a bit tricky with all the percentages and relationships between the three toothpaste tubes, but if I break it down, I can manage.\n\nFirst, we know that Fresh costs $1.00 per unit of volume. That's straightforward. Now, Bright is 60% more expensive than Fresh and has 25% less volume than Glow. Also, Glow is 25% less expensive than Bright and has 33 1/3% more volume than Fresh. We need to find the number of cents per unit of volume of Glow.\n\nOkay, let's start by finding the cost and volume of Bright and Glow in terms of Fresh.\n\nSince Fresh costs $1.00 per unit of volume, let's denote the cost of Fresh as C_f = $1.00 and its volume as V_f.\n\nWait, actually, since Fresh costs $1.00 per unit of volume, and volume is in units, maybe I should think in terms of total cost and total volume.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- C_f = cost of Fresh\n\n- V_f = volume of Fresh\n\nSimilarly for Bright and Glow.\n\nGiven that Fresh costs $1.00 per unit of volume, and assuming Fresh has V_f units of volume, then C_f = V_f * $1.00, so C_f = V_f.\n\nSimilarly, we can express costs and volumes for Bright and Glow.\n\nBut maybe I need to assign variables differently.\n\nLet me try this again.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- C_f = cost of Fresh\n\n- V_f = volume of Fresh\n\n- C_b = cost of Bright\n\n- V_b = volume of Bright\n\n- C_g = cost of Glow\n\n- V_g = volume of Glow\n\nGiven:\n\n1. Bright is 60% more expensive than Fresh: C_b = C_f + 0.60 * C_f = 1.60 * C_f\n\n2. Bright has 25% less volume than Glow: V_b = V_g - 0.25 * V_g = 0.75 * V_g\n\n3. Glow is 25% less expensive than Bright: C_g = C_b - 0.25 * C_b = 0.75 * C_b\n\n4. Glow has 33 1/3% more volume than Fresh: V_g = V_f + (33 1/3)% * V_f = V_f + (1/3) * V_f = (4/3) * V_f\n\nAlso, Fresh costs $1.00 per unit of volume: cost per unit volume of Fresh is $1.00.\n\nWait, but Fresh's total cost C_f is V_f * $1.00, so C_f = V_f.\n\nSimilarly, we can express C_b and C_g in terms of their respective volumes.\n\nBut I need to be careful here. The problem asks for the number of cents per unit of volume of Glow. So, I need to find C_g / V_g in cents.\n\nLet me see.\n\nFrom point 4: V_g = (4/3) * V_f\n\nFrom point 1: C_b = 1.60 * C_f\n\nBut C_f = V_f (since cost per unit volume is $1.00)\n\nSo, C_b = 1.60 * V_f\n\nFrom point 3: C_g = 0.75 * C_b = 0.75 * 1.60 * V_f = 1.20 * V_f\n\nFrom point 2: V_b = 0.75 * V_g\n\nBut V_b can also be expressed in terms of C_b and cost per unit volume of Bright.\n\nWait, I need to be careful here.\n\nActually, I think I need to find relationships between costs and volumes.\n\nGiven that Fresh costs $1.00 per unit volume, so C_f = V_f * $1.00, which means C_f = V_f.\n\nSimilarly, for Bright, C_b = V_b * cost per unit volume of Bright.\n\nBut I don't know the cost per unit volume of Bright yet.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nLet me try to express everything in terms of V_f.\n\nFrom point 4: V_g = (4/3) * V_f\n\nFrom point 2: V_b = 0.75 * V_g = 0.75 * (4/3) * V_f = (1/2) * V_f\n\nFrom point 1: C_b = 1.60 * C_f\n\nBut C_f = V_f * $1.00 = V_f\n\nSo, C_b = 1.60 * V_f\n\nFrom point 3: C_g = 0.75 * C_b = 0.75 * 1.60 * V_f = 1.20 * V_f\n\nNow, C_g = V_g * cost per unit volume of Glow\n\nSo, 1.20 * V_f = (4/3) * V_f * cost per unit volume of Glow\n\nLet me solve for cost per unit volume of Glow:\n\n1.20 * V_f = (4/3) * V_f * cost per unit volume of Glow\n\nDivide both sides by V_f (assuming V_f \u2260 0):\n\n1.20 = (4/3) * cost per unit volume of Glow\n\nLet me solve for cost per unit volume of Glow:\n\ncost per unit volume of Glow = 1.20 / (4/3) = 1.20 * (3/4) = 0.90\n\nSo, cost per unit volume of Glow is $0.90, which is 90 cents per unit volume.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 90\n\nB. 120\n\nC. 60\n\nD. 320\n\nSo, option A. 90 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from Fresh: C_f = V_f = $1.00 (since cost per unit volume is $1.00)\n\nBright: C_b = 1.60 * C_f = 1.60 * V_f\n\nV_b = 0.75 * V_g\n\nBut also, C_b = V_b * cost per unit volume of Bright\n\nWait, I don't know the cost per unit volume of Bright, but maybe I don't need it.\n\nGlow: C_g = 0.75 * C_b = 0.75 * 1.60 * V_f = 1.20 * V_f\n\nV_g = (4/3) * V_f\n\nCost per unit volume of Glow = C_g / V_g = (1.20 * V_f) / (4/3 * V_f) = (1.20 / (4/3)) = 0.90, as calculated before.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 cents per unit of volume for Glow.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]"
