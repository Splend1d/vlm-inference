Whoever sells intoxicating liquor to any person who is intoxicated or inebriated is guilty of a misdemeanor. This section shall not apply in the case of sales of intoxicating liquor by a hotel, motel, or inn to any person registered and resident as a guest in such hotel, motel, or inn for consumption upon the premises thereof. \"\"Section 1213. It shall be unlawful for any vendor with a valid state liquor license to sell intoxicating beverages on Sunday. Anyone in violation of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not less than $100 or more than $1,000. \"The state authorities have regularly enforced the aforementioned dram shop statute and \"blue law\" prohibiting Sunday liquor sales. At 12:30 a. m. on Sunday morning, a customer entered a liquor store and purchased a bottle of wine. The clerk who made the sale, thought the time was 11:30 p. m. Saturday night because that was the time shown on the store's wall clock. Unknown to the clerk, the clock was malfunctioning and was running an hour behind. Thus, the clock displayed the wrong time when the clerk sold the wine to the customer. When the clerk made the sale, the customer did not appear to be visibly inebriated. After making the purchase, the customer drank the entire bottle of wine. He then drove off in his car and struck a pedestrian, injuring him. At the time of the accident, the customer was intoxicated from drinking the wine. If the pedestrian asserts a claim against the liquor store, will the plaintiff prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the liquor store was negligent per se by selling the wine in violation of the \"blue law\" prohibiting Sunday liquor sales.\nB. Yes, because the accident would not have occurred but for the sale of the wine to the customer.\nC. No, because the purpose of the \"blue law\" prohibiting Sunday liquor sales was not to prevent accidents caused by drivers driving while intoxicated.\nD. No, because the clerk did not violate the dram shop statute, and his violation of the \"blue law\" resulted from the clock's malfunctioning.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out if the pedestrian can successfully sue the liquor store for selling wine to a customer who then got drunk and caused an accident. There are a couple of statutes involved: one about not selling liquor to intoxicated people, and another about not selling liquor on Sundays. The customer bought the wine at what he thought was 11:30 p.m. on Saturday, but it was actually 12:30 a.m. on Sunday due to a malfunctioning clock in the store. The customer drank the wine, drove, and hit a pedestrian while intoxicated.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relevant laws. There's a dram shop statute, Section 1212, which says you can't sell liquor to someone who's already intoxicated, except in certain cases like hotels selling to their guests. Then there's Section 1213, which prohibits selling intoxicating beverages on Sundays, and there's a penalty for violating that.\n\nThe customer bought the wine after midnight on Sunday, which is against the law because of the Sunday sales ban. The clerk thought it was still Saturday night because the clock was wrong, so he didn't realize he was breaking the law.\n\nNow, the pedestrian wants to sue the liquor store. The question is whether the pedestrian will prevail in this claim.\n\nOption A says yes, because the liquor store was negligent per se by selling the wine in violation of the \"blue law\" prohibiting Sunday liquor sales.\n\nNegligence per se means that violating a statute is considered negligent behavior in itself, if the statute is designed to prevent the kind of harm that occurred. So, in this case, if the purpose of the Sunday sales ban is to prevent drunk driving accidents, then violating the ban could be considered negligence per se if someone gets hurt as a result.\n\nBut wait, the question is whether the pedestrian will prevail. So, I need to think about whether the Sunday sales law is intended to prevent drunk driving accidents.\n\nOption C says no, because the purpose of the blue law prohibiting Sunday liquor sales was not to prevent accidents caused by drivers driving while intoxicated.\n\nHmm, that seems relevant. If the law wasn't meant to prevent drunk driving accidents, then maybe negligence per se doesn't apply.\n\nOption D says no, because the clerk didn't violate the dram shop statute, and his violation of the blue law was due to the clock malfunctioning.\n\nSo, the dram shop statute is about selling to intoxicated people, which wasn't the case here\u2014the customer didn't appear intoxicated when he bought the wine. So, the clerk didn't violate that law.\n\nBut he did violate the Sunday sales ban because he sold liquor after midnight, even though he didn't know it was Sunday.\n\nThe clock was malfunctioning, so the clerk was mistaken about the time. Does that matter in terms of liability?\n\nIn some laws, ignorance or mistake of fact can be a defense if the person didn't intend to break the law or if they exercised reasonable care to avoid breaking it.\n\nBut in this case, it's a strict liability offense, meaning you can be held responsible even if you didn't know you were breaking the law.\n\nWait, is that right? In many jurisdictions, alcohol sales laws are considered strict liability, meaning you can't use ignorance as a defense.\n\nSo, even if the clerk didn't know it was Sunday, selling liquor on Sunday is still illegal, and the store can be penalized.\n\nBut the question is about civil liability to the pedestrian, not about the store being fined by the state.\n\nSo, in a civil case, would the store be liable for the pedestrian's injuries because they sold wine on Sunday, which led to the accident?\n\nOption A suggests that it's negligence per se because of violating the blue law.\n\nBut option C says no, because the purpose of the blue law isn't to prevent accidents caused by drunk driving.\n\nI need to think about the purpose of the blue law. Blue laws are typically based on religious or moral grounds, aiming to observe a day of rest or to reduce vice and immorality.\n\nThey may not specifically be intended to prevent drunk driving accidents; rather, they might be intended to reduce overall alcohol consumption on certain days or to respect religious observances.\n\nSo, if the purpose of the blue law isn't directly related to preventing drunk driving accidents, then violating it might not be negligence per se in the context of causing an accident.\n\nOn the other hand, selling alcohol on Sunday increases the opportunity for people to drink and drive, which could lead to accidents.\n\nBut if the law wasn't specifically aimed at preventing accidents, maybe the connection is too indirect for negligence per se to apply.\n\nOption B says yes, because the accident wouldn't have happened but for the sale of the wine.\n\nThis is the \"but for\" causation test. It's a way of determining whether the defendant's actions were a cause of the plaintiff's injury.\n\nIn this case, if the customer hadn't bought the wine, he wouldn't have drunk it and driven drunk, so the accident wouldn't have happened.\n\nSo, in that sense, the sale of the wine was a cause of the accident.\n\nBut in legal terms, is the liquor store liable for the customer's misuse of the wine?\n\nNormally, when you sell a product, you're not liable for how someone uses it unless there's something inherently dangerous about it or unless you knew or should have known that the person would use it in a harmful way.\n\nIn this case, the customer appeared sober when he bought the wine, so the clerk didn't have reason to suspect he would drink it and drive.\n\nSo, maybe the store isn't liable based on the dram shop statute because the customer wasn't visibly intoxicated at the time of sale.\n\nBut the dram shop statute only applies to selling to intoxicated persons, which wasn't the case here.\n\nSo, the dram shop statute isn't directly relevant here.\n\nOption D mentions that the clerk didn't violate the dram shop statute, which is true, but he did violate the blue law by selling on Sunday.\n\nBut option D also mentions that the violation was due to the clock malfunctioning.\n\nSo, even though the clerk didn't intend to violate the law, he still did violate it, and in civil law, sometimes intent isn't necessary for liability.\n\nBut again, the question is whether the pedestrian will prevail in their claim against the liquor store.\n\nOption A relies on negligence per se based on violating the blue law.\n\nIf the blue law wasn't intended to prevent drunk driving accidents, then maybe negligence per se doesn't apply.\n\nOption C directly states that the blue law wasn't intended to prevent such accidents.\n\nSo, perhaps the pedestrian won't prevail because the connection between the blue law violation and the accident isn't strong enough.\n\nOption D suggests that the clerk didn't violate the dram shop statute, and his violation of the blue law was due to a mistake.\n\nBut even if it was a mistake, if the blue law is strictly enforced, the store might still be liable.\n\nHowever, if the purpose of the blue law isn't to prevent accidents, then maybe the store isn't liable for accidents caused by customers who drink and drive after buying alcohol on Sunday.\n\nI think the key here is understanding the purpose of the blue law.\n\nIf the blue law is meant to reduce alcohol consumption on Sundays for moral or religious reasons, and not specifically to prevent drunk driving accidents, then violating it might not directly lead to liability for accidents.\n\nOn the other hand, selling alcohol on Sunday increases the risk of drunk driving, which could lead to accidents.\n\nBut if that wasn't the primary purpose of the law, maybe the store isn't liable based on negligence per se.\n\nOption B seems too broad, saying yes because but for the sale, the accident wouldn't have happened.\n\nBut in law, causation needs to be more direct, and there needs to be a duty owed by the store to the pedestrian.\n\nMaybe the store doesn't have a duty to prevent customers from drinking and driving if they appear sober at the time of sale.\n\nSo, perhaps the pedestrian won't prevail.\n\nI'm leaning towards option C or D.\n\nOption C says no, because the purpose of the blue law wasn't to prevent accidents caused by drunk driving.\n\nOption D says no, because the clerk didn't violate the dram shop statute, and his violation of the blue law was due to the clock malfunctioning.\n\nBut the clock malfunctioning might not be a valid defense if the blue law is strictly enforced.\n\nSo, maybe option C is the better answer, as it addresses the purpose of the law.\n\nYes, I think that's the key point.\n\nSo, the answer is no, because the purpose of the blue law prohibiting Sunday liquor sales was not to prevent accidents caused by drivers driving while intoxicated.\n\nTherefore, the pedestrian will not prevail in their claim against the liquor store.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
