                    "text": "A gambler learned that a friend of his was planning a vacation to visit some casinos. The gambler, who was an avid college football fan, approached his friend. The gambler explained that he wanted to place a bet with a sports-betting agency that his beloved team would win the college football championship the next year. The gambler further explained that he had read that the odds of his team winning the football championship next year were listed as 100-1, and he wanted to place a $1,000 bet on his team. The gambler told his friend that he would pay him for his efforts. After further discussion, the gambler wrote up the following agreement:\"I hereby promise to pay my friend $100 if he will place a $1,000 bet for me that my favorite team will win the college football championship next year. The bet is to be placed at my lucky casino sports book. I further promise to pay my friend an additional $100 within 30 days after the bet is placed. \"Since the gambler knew his wife would be angry if she found out about the bet, the gambler included a clause that the friend promised not to tell anyone about the bet. After both the gambler and his friend signed the agreement, the gambler gave him $1,100, representing $1,000 to place the bet and $100 as the initial payment for the friend's efforts. The friend then went on vacation. Shortly after arrival, the friend attempted to place the bet for the gambler. However, the friend discovered that the gambler's lucky casino had recently closed its sports book. The friend then entered another casino next door and discovered that they had a sports book, also offering 100-1 odds on the gambler's favorite team winning the college football championship the next year. The friend placed the bet with the other casino's sports book. After returning from his vacation, the friend gave the betting slip to the gambler. Nothing more was said until 30 days later, when the friend asked the gambler when he was going to receive the final $100. The gambler then refused to pay anything more to the friend. In a breach of contract action by the friend to collect the $100, which of the following, if true, is the gambler's best defense?\n\nA. The contract was void ab initio, because the contract could not be performed in its entirety within the span of one year.\nB. The friend's placing the $1,000 bet at the other casino instead of at the gambler's lucky casino constituted a material breach of contract, thereby relieving the gambler of any further contractual obligations under the terms of their agreement.\nC. While on vacation, the friend told his girlfriend about the $1,000 that he bet on the gambler's behalf.\nD. Since the gambler's lucky casino no longer had a sports book at which to place the bet, all contractual obligations would be suspended under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a gambler and his friend making a bet on a college football championship. The gambler wants to bet $1,000 on his favorite team at 100-1 odds, and he's paying his friend $100 upfront and another $100 within 30 days for placing the bet. They have an agreement in writing, and there's a clause about not telling anyone about the bet. The friend goes on vacation, finds out the gambler's lucky casino is closed, but places the bet at another casino with the same odds. Then, the friend gives the betting slip to the gambler, but when the friend asks for the remaining $100 after 30 days, the gambler refuses to pay. Now, the friend is suing for breach of contract to get that $100, and I need to figure out which defense the gambler has.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. The contract was void ab initio because it couldn't be performed within one year.\n\nB. The friend placing the bet at another casino instead of the gambler's lucky one is a material breach, relieving the gambler of further obligations.\n\nC. The friend told his girlfriend about the bet while on vacation.\n\nD. The closure of the lucky casino suspends all contractual obligations under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.\n\nFirst, option A says the contract is void from the beginning because it couldn't be performed within one year. I need to recall if contracts that can't be performed within one year are void. I think there's a rule about contracts that can't be performed within one year needing to be in writing, but I'm not sure if that makes them void ab initio. Maybe I should look into the Statute of Frauds.\n\nWait, the Statute of Frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable, including contracts that cannot be performed within one year. But does that make the contract void ab initio if it's not in writing? I think it makes the contract unenforceable, not necessarily void. Void means it's invalid and never existed legally, whereas unenforceable means it's valid but can't be enforced in court. So, maybe this isn't the best defense.\n\nOption B says that the friend placing the bet at another casino instead of the specified lucky one is a material breach, relieving the gambler of further obligations. A material breach is when one party fails to do something significant in the contract, which allows the other party to not perform their part. In this case, the contract specified that the bet should be placed at the gambler's lucky casino. But the friend placed it at another casino because the lucky one was closed. However, the other casino offered the same odds, and the bet was placed as requested. So, is this really a material breach? It seems like the essence of the contract was fulfilled\u2014placing the bet at 100-1 odds\u2014but just not at the specified casino. Maybe the gambler had some sentimental attachment to the lucky casino, but legally, if the bet was placed as requested, this might not be a material breach.\n\nOption C mentions that the friend told his girlfriend about the bet while on vacation. There was a clause in the agreement that the friend promised not to tell anyone about the bet. So, if the friend told his girlfriend, that would be a breach of that confidentiality clause. But does this relieve the gambler of paying the remaining $100? Well, it depends on whether this breach is material enough to affect the entire contract. Telling his girlfriend might not be as significant as failing to place the bet correctly, but it's still a breach. Maybe the gambler can use this as a defense to withhold payment, but I'm not sure if it's the best one.\n\nOption D talks about the doctrine of frustration of purpose because the lucky casino was closed. Frustration of purpose occurs when an unforeseen event makes the contract's purpose impossible to achieve. But in this case, the purpose of the contract was to place a bet, and the friend did place the bet at another casino with the same odds. So, the purpose was still achieved; it's just that it wasn't at the specified casino. Does that mean the purpose was frustrated? Probably not, since the essential part of the contract (placing the bet at 100-1 odds) was fulfilled.\n\nNow, considering all this, which option is the gambler's best defense? Option B seems strong because the friend didn't place the bet at the specified casino, which might have been an important term in the contract. However, the friend placed the bet at another casino with the same odds, so the main objective was achieved. Maybe the court would consider this a minor deviation rather than a material breach.\n\nOption C is about the friend breaching the confidentiality clause by telling his girlfriend. While this is a breach, it might not be directly related to the friend's failure to receive the remaining $100, especially if the confidentiality clause was separate from the payment terms.\n\nOption D doesn't seem applicable because the purpose of the contract wasn't frustrated; the bet was still placed as requested, just at a different casino.\n\nOption A might not be correct because, even if the contract couldn't be performed within one year, that typically makes the contract unenforceable, not void ab initio.\n\nSo, perhaps the best defense is Option B, arguing that the friend's failure to place the bet at the specified casino constitutes a material breach, relieving the gambler of further obligations. However, I have some doubts because the friend did place the bet at another casino with the same odds, which was the primary objective.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the gambler can argue that the friend had authority only to place the bet at the specified casino, and by placing it elsewhere, the friend exceeded his authority. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gambler can argue that the friend was supposed to place the bet at the lucky casino, and since it was closed, the friend should have found out beforehand and informed the gambler, who might have wanted to choose another casino himself.\n\nBut in the scenario, it says that the friend discovered the casino was closed upon arrival and then placed the bet at another casino offering the same odds. So, it seems like the friend took reasonable steps to fulfill the contract under the circumstances.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the friend had implied authority to place the bet at another casino if the specified one was closed, given that the primary objective was to place the bet, not necessarily where it was placed.\n\nBut perhaps the gambler can argue that the specified casino was essential and that any deviation is a breach.\n\nI need to think about the materiality of the breach. If the friend placed the bet at another casino, but with the same odds, is that a significant enough deviation to relieve the gambler of paying the remaining $100?\n\nMaybe the court would consider this a minor breach and require the gambler to pay the $100, perhaps with some reduction for the breach, but not necessarily full relief.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gambler can argue that the friend's actions caused some damage or that the bet might not be as favorable because it wasn't placed at the lucky casino.\n\nBut that seems speculative. The odds were the same, so the substance of the bet is unchanged.\n\nI'm starting to think that Option B might not be the strongest defense after all.\n\nWhat other defenses could the gambler have? Maybe arguing that the contract was for an illegal purpose, but betting on sports can be legal depending on the jurisdiction, so that might not hold up.\n\nOr perhaps arguing that the friend didn't perform as per the contract, but as I thought earlier, the friend did place the bet as instructed, just at a different casino.\n\nWait, maybe the gambler can argue that the friend was supposed to get his consent before placing the bet at another casino.\n\nBut in the scenario, it says that the friend placed the bet and then gave the betting slip to the gambler, and nothing more was said until 30 days later.\n\nSo, perhaps the gambler can argue that by not objecting immediately, he waived his right to object to the casino choice.\n\nBut that might not be a strong defense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gambler can argue that the friend had a duty to inform him that the lucky casino was closed and seek further instructions, and by failing to do so, the friend breached the contract.\n\nBut again, the friend placed the bet at another casino with the same odds, which seems reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I need to consider that the gambler already paid $100 upfront, and the remaining $100 was promised within 30 days.\n\nSo, the gambler has already partially performed, paying $100, and now is refusing to pay the remaining $100.\n\nWhat could be the gambler's best defense to not paying the remaining $100?\n\nOption C says that the friend told his girlfriend about the bet, which breaches the confidentiality clause.\n\nIf that's the case, perhaps the gambler can withhold the remaining payment as a remedy for that breach.\n\nBut I'm not sure how significant that breach is, especially if the gambler's main concern was where the bet was placed.\n\nMaybe the gambler can combine both defenses: the friend placed the bet at another casino and breached the confidentiality clause.\n\nBut I need to pick the best defense among the options provided.\n\nOption D suggests that the closure of the lucky casino frustrates the purpose of the contract, but as I thought earlier, the purpose was still achieved by placing the bet at another casino with the same odds.\n\nSo, that doesn't seem applicable.\n\nOption A claims the contract is void ab initio because it couldn't be performed within one year.\n\nI need to recall if contracts that can't be performed within one year are void ab initio.\n\nI think the Statute of Frauds requires contracts that can't be performed within one year to be in writing, but that doesn't make them void ab initio.\n\nIt makes them unenforceable if they're not in writing.\n\nBut in this case, the agreement is in writing, so that defense doesn't seem applicable.\n\nWait, the agreement is in writing, so even if it couldn't be performed within one year, since it's in writing, it should be enforceable.\n\nSo, Option A is incorrect.\n\nBetween Options B and C, I need to decide which one is the gambler's best defense.\n\nOption B is about the friend placing the bet at another casino being a material breach.\n\nOption C is about the friend breaching the confidentiality clause by telling his girlfriend.\n\nI think the primary issue here is the place where the bet was placed.\n\nThe friend was supposed to place the bet at the gambler's lucky casino, but it was closed, so he placed it at another casino with the same odds.\n\nIs this a material breach?\n\nI think it depends on whether placing the bet at the lucky casino was a condition of the contract or just a promise.\n\nIf it was a condition, then failing to do so would be a material breach.\n\nBut if it was just a promise, then failing to do so might not be a material breach, especially since the friend took reasonable steps to fulfill the contract by placing the bet at another casino with the same odds.\n\nGiven that, maybe the court would not consider it a material breach, and the gambler can't rely on that as a defense to withhold the remaining payment.\n\nTherefore, Option B might not be the best defense.\n\nOption C, on the other hand, is about the friend breaching the confidentiality clause.\n\nThis is a separate issue, but it's still a breach of the contract.\n\nPerhaps the gambler can argue that the friend's breach of the confidentiality clause allows him to withhold the remaining payment.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nIn contract law, breaches of different clauses might not necessarily allow the other party to withhold payments unrelated to those breaches.\n\nFor example, if the confidentiality clause was separate from the payment terms, then breaching it might entitle the gambler to some remedy, like damages, but not necessarily to withhold the remaining payment for the friend's services in placing the bet.\n\nSo, maybe Option C isn't the best defense either.\n\nOption D is about the doctrine of frustration of purpose due to the closure of the lucky casino.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, the purpose of the contract was to place the bet, which was done, so this defense doesn't seem applicable.\n\nSo, perhaps the best defense is Option B, arguing that the friend's failure to place the bet at the specified casino is a material breach, relieving the gambler of further obligations.\n\nEven though the friend placed the bet at another casino with the same odds, which achieved the primary objective, the gambler might argue that the specified casino was essential and that any deviation is a breach.\n\nHowever, I still have doubts because the friend took reasonable steps to fulfill the contract under the circumstances.\n\nMaybe the court would consider this a minor breach and require the gambler to pay the remaining $100, perhaps with some reduction for the breach.\n\nBut among the options provided, Option B seems to be the strongest defense for the gambler.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
