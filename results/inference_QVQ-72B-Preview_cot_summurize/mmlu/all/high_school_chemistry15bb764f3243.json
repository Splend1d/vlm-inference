                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of the following has an octet of electrons around the central atom?\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. BF3\n\nB. NH4+\n\nC. PF5\n\nD. SF6\n\nAlright, so first things first, I need to understand what an octet of electrons means. From my chemistry classes, I remember that in valence shells, atoms tend to have eight electrons because that's a stable configuration. So, an octet is eight electrons around the central atom.\n\nNow, I need to look at each of these molecules or ions and determine if the central atom has eight electrons around it.\n\nLet's start with BF3, which is boron trifluoride.\n\nBoron (B) is group 13, so it has three valence electrons.\n\nFluorine (F) is group 17, so it has seven valence electrons.\n\nIn BF3, boron is the central atom, and it's bonded to three fluorines.\n\nEach fluorine brings one bond, so boron forms three covalent bonds.\n\nEach bond shares two electrons, so boron has six electrons around it: 3 bonds \u00d7 2 electrons = 6 electrons.\n\nBut wait, an octet is eight electrons. So, if boron only has six, that's not an octet.\n\nMaybe it has some lone pairs? Let me check.\n\nBoron has three valence electrons, uses six in bonds, so no lone pairs.\n\nSo, total electrons around boron in BF3 is six, which is not an octet.\n\nSo, option A is out.\n\nNext, NH4+, which is ammonium ion.\n\nNitrogen (N) is group 15, so it has five valence electrons.\n\nHydrogen (H) has one valence electron.\n\nIn NH4+, nitrogen is the central atom, bonded to four hydrogens.\n\nEach bond is covalent, sharing two electrons.\n\nSo, four bonds \u00d7 two electrons = eight electrons.\n\nBut wait, nitrogen normally has five valence electrons, and in this case, it's forming four bonds, using eight electrons.\n\nBut in reality, nitrogen in NH4+ is achieving a stable configuration similar to that of carbon, with eight electrons around it.\n\nSo, it seems like nitrogen in NH4+ has an octet.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nTotal electrons around nitrogen: four bonds with hydrogen, each bond has two electrons, so eight electrons.\n\nAdditionally, nitrogen has five valence electrons, and in forming four bonds, it uses four of them, leaving one electron.\n\nBut in NH4+, there's a positive charge, meaning one electron is lost.\n\nSo, four bonds (eight electrons) plus one electron from nitrogen makes nine electrons around nitrogen.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up.\n\nActually, in NH4+, nitrogen has four bonds and no lone pairs.\n\nSo, total electrons around nitrogen are eight, which is an octet.\n\nTherefore, NH4+ has an octet around its central atom.\n\nSo, option B seems to be a possible answer.\n\nBut I should check the others to be sure.\n\nNext, PF5, which is phosphorus pentfluoride.\n\nPhosphorus (P) is group 15, so it has five valence electrons.\n\nFluorine (F) is group 17, seven valence electrons.\n\nIn PF5, phosphorus is central, bonded to five fluorines.\n\nEach bond is covalent, sharing two electrons.\n\nSo, five bonds \u00d7 two electrons = ten electrons around phosphorus.\n\nBut an octet is eight electrons.\n\nSo, phosphorus in PF5 has ten electrons around it, which is more than an octet.\n\nTherefore, option C is not correct.\n\nLastly, SF6, sulfur hexafluoride.\n\nSulfur (S) is group 16, six valence electrons.\n\nFluorine (F) again, seven valence electrons.\n\nIn SF6, sulfur is central, bonded to six fluorines.\n\nEach bond is covalent, sharing two electrons.\n\nSo, six bonds \u00d7 two electrons = twelve electrons around sulfur.\n\nAgain, an octet is eight electrons, so sulfur in SF6 has twelve electrons around it, which is more than an octet.\n\nTherefore, option D is not correct.\n\nSo, going back to option B, NH4+, which does have an octet around its central atom, nitrogen.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that in some cases, central atoms can have more than eight electrons, like in expanded octets, especially if they're larger atoms.\n\nBut in this case, nitrogen is in period 2, and it's generally not supposed to expand its octet.\n\nSo, NH4+ having exactly eight electrons around nitrogen seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nLet me consider the formal charge.\n\nIn NH4+, the nitrogen has four bonds and no lone pairs.\n\nThe formal charge on nitrogen is valence electrons (5) minus non-bonding electrons (0) minus bonding electrons (8) divided by 2, which is (5 - 0 - 8)/2 = -1.\n\nBut the overall charge is +1, so it makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, the formal charge on nitrogen is -1, and the molecule has a +1 charge, likely due to the loss of an electron somewhere.\n\nBut in terms of electron arrangement around nitrogen, it's still eight electrons.\n\nSo, I think NH4+ is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other options could possibly have an octet.\n\nBF3: We already saw it has six electrons around boron, which is less than eight.\n\nPF5: Ten electrons around phosphorus, more than eight.\n\nSF6: Twelve electrons around sulfur, again more than eight.\n\nSo, indeed, NH4+ is the only one with exactly eight electrons around its central atom.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. NH4+\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ NH_{4}^{+}} \\]"
