From what I remember, the median is the middle value when they're all ordered from least to greatest. Since there are nine numbers, the fifth one should be the median, right?\n\nFirst, I need to order these numbers. Let's see: 8, 10, 10, 13, 22, 24, 26, 32, 35. Yeah, that looks ordered from least to greatest.\n\nNow, counting the positions: 1 is 8, 2 is 10, 3 is 10, 4 is 13, 5 is 22, 6 is 24, 7 is 26, 8 is 32, 9 is 35.\n\nSo, the fifth number is 22. But wait, I thought the median should be the middle value. For nine numbers, the fifth one should be the median. But let me double-check.\n\nI recall that for an odd number of observations, the median is indeed the middle one. So with nine numbers, the fifth one is the median. So, 22 seems correct.\n\nBut looking at the options, A is 23, B is 20, C is 22, D is 27. So, C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check again if I ordered the numbers correctly. Let's list them again: 8, 10, 10, 13, 22, 24, 26, 32, 35. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to arrange them in a different way to confirm. Let's see, 8 is the smallest, then 10, then 13, then 22, 24, 26, 32, and 35. Yes, no mistakes there.\n\nSo, the median is 22. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 22.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a different way to look at it. Like, maybe considering the frequency of numbers. For example, 10 appears twice, but since we're ordering them, it doesn't really affect the median position.\n\nOr maybe I should think about the definition again. The median divides the data into two halves, with one half being less than or equal to the median and the other half being greater than or equal to it. In this case, with nine numbers, the fifth one should have four numbers below it and four above it.\n\nLet me count: below 22, we have 8, 10, 10, 13 \u2013 that's four numbers. Above 22, we have 24, 26, 32, 35 \u2013 another four numbers. So, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the mode or the mean, but no, the question specifically asks for the median.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident with my answer. The median is 22, which is option C.\n\nJust to make sure, let me check if there's any other way that the median could be interpreted. For example, maybe they want the median of some other set, but no, the question is clear: find the median of the given set of data.\n\nAlso, perhaps they want the median of the frequencies, but again, that doesn't apply here since each number is unique except for 10 repeating twice.\n\nNo, I think I've covered all possible angles here. The answer should be C. 22.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
