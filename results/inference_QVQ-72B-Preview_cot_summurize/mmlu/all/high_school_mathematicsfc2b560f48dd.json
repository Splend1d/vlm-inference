                    "text": "So I've got this equation: 3^(x \u2013 3) + 10 = 19. I need to solve for x. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to isolate the exponential part, which is 3^(x \u2013 3). To do that, I should subtract 10 from both sides of the equation. So, 3^(x \u2013 3) + 10 - 10 = 19 - 10, which simplifies to 3^(x \u2013 3) = 9.\n\nNow, I have 3^(x \u2013 3) = 9. I need to solve for x. I know that 3^2 = 9, but here it's 3 to the power of (x \u2013 3). So, maybe I can set the exponents equal to each other if I can express 9 as a power of 3.\n\nWait, 9 is 3^2, so I can rewrite the equation as 3^(x \u2013 3) = 3^2. Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. So, x \u2013 3 = 2.\n\nNow, to find x, I just add 3 to both sides of the equation: x = 2 + 3, which means x = 5.\n\nLet me check if that's correct. Plug x = 5 into the original equation: 3^(5 \u2013 3) + 10 = 3^2 + 10 = 9 + 10 = 19. Yes, that matches the given equation.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 5.\n\nWait a minute, let me see if there's another way to solve this, maybe using logarithms or something. Just to verify.\n\nStarting from 3^(x \u2013 3) = 9, I could take the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(3^(x \u2013 3)) = ln(9).\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule, which is ln(a^b) = b * ln(a), I get (x \u2013 3) * ln(3) = ln(9).\n\nNow, I can solve for x \u2013 3: x \u2013 3 = ln(9) / ln(3).\n\nI know that ln(9) / ln(3) is equal to log3(9), which is 2, because 3^2 = 9.\n\nSo, x \u2013 3 = 2, which again gives me x = 5.\n\nAlright, that confirms my earlier result. It's good to know that both methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is multiple-choice, I could have just plugged in the options to see which one satisfies the equation.\n\nLet's try option A: x = 3.\n\nPlug into the equation: 3^(3 \u2013 3) + 10 = 3^0 + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11, which is not equal to 19.\n\nOption B: x = 4.\n\n3^(4 \u2013 3) + 10 = 3^1 + 10 = 3 + 10 = 13, not 19.\n\nOption C: x = 5.\n\n3^(5 \u2013 3) + 10 = 3^2 + 10 = 9 + 10 = 19. This matches the equation.\n\nOption D: x = 6.\n\n3^(6 \u2013 3) + 10 = 3^3 + 10 = 27 + 10 = 37, which is more than 19.\n\nSo, by plugging in, it's clear that x = 5 is the correct answer.\n\nBut since I already solved it algebraically and confirmed with logarithms, I'm confident that C. 5 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
