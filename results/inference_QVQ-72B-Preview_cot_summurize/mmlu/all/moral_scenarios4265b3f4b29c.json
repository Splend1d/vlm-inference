                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about two different scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: At the grocery store, I coughed into my shirt sleeve.\n\nScenario 2: I called the police on my friend for doing a good deed.\n\nAnd the question is asking for which of these scenarios the main character (who uses \"I/me/my\") does something clearly morally wrong.\n\nOkay, so to approach this, I think I should consider each scenario individually and evaluate whether the action described is considered morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US around 2020.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1: Coughing into one's shirt sleeve at the grocery store.\n\nI remember that around 2020, there was a lot of emphasis on hygiene practices due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health organizations were recommending coughing into your elbow or a tissue to prevent the spread of germs. Specifically, they advised against coughing into your shirt sleeve because it could contaminate the sleeve and potentially spread germs to other surfaces or people.\n\nSo, if someone coughed into their shirt sleeve in a public place like a grocery store, where there are many people around, it could be seen as not following proper hygiene practices, which could be considered irresponsible or inconsiderate, especially during a pandemic.\n\nBut is this considered clearly morally wrong? I need to think about that. Morality often involves harm or the potential for harm to others. In this case, coughing into a shirt sleeve could potentially spread illness to others, which could be seen as harmful. However, it's also possible that the person didn't know the proper way to cough or was in a hurry and didn't have a tissue handy.\n\nConsidering that, I think there's a gray area here. While it's not the best practice and could be seen as negligent, especially during a pandemic, I'm not sure if it's clearly morally wrong. Maybe it's more of a lapse in judgment or ignorance of the rules rather than a deliberate act to harm others.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: Calling the police on a friend for doing a good deed.\n\nThis one seems more straightforward at first glance. If someone does a good deed and you report them to the police for it, that sounds like you're trying to get them in trouble for something positive they did. That seems morally wrong because you're actively working against someone's positive action and potentially causing them harm or inconvenience.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more context here. Maybe the \"good deed\" had some unintended consequences, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding about what constitutes a good deed. For example, if someone did something that was well-intentioned but illegal, like breaking into a building to save someone's life, then calling the police might be seen as the right thing to do, depending on the situation.\n\nHowever, the scenario is quite vague and doesn't provide specific details about what the good deed was or what the circumstances were. It just says, \"I called the police on my friend for doing a good deed.\"\n\nGiven that, I think I need to consider the most straightforward interpretation. If someone does a good deed, and you call the police on them for it, without any additional context, it seems like you're reporting them for something positive they did, which aligns with Scenario 2 being morally wrong.\n\nComparing both scenarios, Scenario 1 seems more like a mistake or a lapse in judgment, while Scenario 2 appears to be a deliberate action to report someone for doing something good, which seems more clearly morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe both scenarios could be considered morally wrong depending on the context. For example, in Scenario 1, if the person knew they had a contagious illness and deliberately coughed into their sleeve to spread germs, that would be clearly morally wrong. Similarly, in Scenario 2, if the good deed was actually illegal or caused harm, calling the police might be justified.\n\nHowever, the scenarios don't provide that level of detail, so I have to rely on the information given.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Maybe the question is testing my understanding of moral actions based on societal norms in the US around 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, coughing into one's shirt sleeve in a public place like a grocery store could be seen as irresponsible during the pandemic, as it could spread germs. But is it clearly morally wrong, or is it more of a public health guideline violation?\n\nI think there's a difference between moral wrongness and breaking health guidelines. While it's important to follow health recommendations, especially during a pandemic, coughing into a shirt sleeve might be seen as a mistake or ignorance rather than a deliberate immoral act.\n\nOn the other hand, calling the police on someone for doing a good deed seems like a deliberate act to harm or punish someone for positive behavior, which aligns more clearly with being morally wrong.\n\nGiven that, I'm leaning towards \"Not wrong\" for Scenario 1 and \"Wrong\" for Scenario 2.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps in Scenario 1, if the person knew they had a contagious illness and deliberately coughed into their sleeve to avoid drawing attention to themselves, that could be seen as morally wrong because they're knowingly putting others at risk.\n\nBut again, the scenario doesn't specify that. It just says \"I coughed into my shirt sleeve,\" without mentioning any knowledge of being sick or intentions behind it.\n\nSimilarly, in Scenario 2, if the friend's good deed was something that was against the law, like vandalizing property to protest, then calling the police might be seen as the right thing to do, even if the friend had good intentions.\n\nBut again, the scenario is vague and doesn't provide specifics about the nature of the good deed or the legal implications.\n\nGiven that, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that in Scenario 1, coughing into one's shirt sleeve is not clearly morally wrong, whereas calling the police on a friend for doing a good deed is clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at this.\n\nPerhaps both scenarios could be seen as morally wrong from different perspectives. For example, in Scenario 1, even if it's just a lapse in judgment, it could still be considered morally wrong because of the potential harm to others. Similarly, in Scenario 2, if the good deed was something that was against the law but still morally right, calling the police could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nHowever, I think that's overcomplicating things. Based on the information provided, Scenario 1 is more about a health guideline violation, which might be seen as irresponsible but not necessarily clearly morally wrong, whereas Scenario 2 involves reporting someone for doing something good, which aligns more clearly with being morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong."
