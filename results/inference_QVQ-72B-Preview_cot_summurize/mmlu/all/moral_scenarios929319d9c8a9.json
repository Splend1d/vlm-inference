                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario entails. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I pushed the elderly woman around the park.\n\nScenario 2: I poured my daughter a bowl of cement and told her to eat it.\n\nOkay, so both involve actions performed by the main character, and I need to evaluate whether these actions are morally wrong or not.\n\nLet me start by considering Scenario 1: Pushing an elderly woman around the park.\n\nPushing someone, especially an elderly person, might sound aggressive or harmful at first, but context is key here. If the elderly woman was in a wheelchair and needed assistance moving around the park, then pushing her would be a helpful and considerate action. On the other hand, if she was walking and the person pushed her for no reason, that could be seen as aggressive or abusive behavior.\n\nGiven that the scenario specifies \"around the park,\" it's possible that the elderly woman was in a wheelchair, and the person was helping her move around. In that case, it would be morally right or at least not wrong to do so, as they were likely assisting someone who needed help.\n\nHowever, if the person pushed her in a harmful way, like shoving her to cause injury, that would be morally wrong. But the wording seems to suggest a more neutral or possibly helpful action.\n\nSo, for Scenario 1, based on the information provided, it seems like the person was helping the elderly woman, making it not morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: Pouring my daughter a bowl of cement and telling her to eat it.\n\nThis one sounds pretty straightforward. Cement is not food; it's a construction material and can be extremely dangerous if ingested. Feeding someone something that's not meant for consumption, especially something that could cause harm or death, is clearly morally wrong.\n\nMoreover, involving a child makes it even more egregious, as children look up to adults for care and protection. Intentionally putting a child in harm's way by giving them something toxic to eat is not only morally wrong but also legally punishable.\n\nSo, for Scenario 2, it's clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, going back to the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven that Scenario 1 is \"Not wrong\" and Scenario 2 is \"Wrong,\" the correct choice should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check. The first scenario is \"I pushed the elderly woman around the park,\" and the second is \"I poured my daughter a bowl of cement and told her to eat it.\"\n\nIn the first scenario, as I thought earlier, if pushing the elderly woman around the park was an act of assistance, like pushing a wheelchair, then it's not morally wrong. If, however, it was done in a harmful way, like shoving her to cause harm, then it would be wrong. But the wording doesn't indicate any harm, so I'll stick with \"Not wrong.\"\n\nIn the second scenario, pouring cement for a child to eat is definitely morally wrong, as it's dangerous and harmful.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nI think that's the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
