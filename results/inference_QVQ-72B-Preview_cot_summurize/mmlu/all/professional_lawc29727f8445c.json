                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a traveler who got robbed and injured in a hotel room. Let me try to understand what's going on and figure out which option is correct.\n\nFirst, the traveler is staying in a hotel room. While he's watching TV, a thief breaks in, hits him over the head, and steals his wallet. The traveler gets a concussion and has to stay in the hospital for three days. Now, the lock on the hotel room door meets the local ordinance standards for security. The traveler wants to sue the hotel for damages due to his injury and the stolen wallet.\n\nI need to determine whether the traveler will prevail based on the given options.\n\nOption A says he will prevail if the lock was defectively designed. Hmm, but the problem states that the lock fully complied with local ordinance standards. So, if it meets the required standards, does that mean it's not defectively designed? Maybe the lock was properly designed according to the ordinance, so perhaps there isn't a defective design issue here. Maybe.\n\nOption B says he will prevail because he was a business visitor on the hotel's property. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that he was a business visitor. It just says he was traveling and checked into the hotel for the night. So, unless specified otherwise, I think he's considered a guest, regardless of the reason for his stay. But does that matter in this context?\n\nOption C says he will not prevail because the thief's act was an intervening cause. Intervening cause sounds like something that comes between the original action and the harm, and it might relieve the hotel of liability. But in this case, the thief's actions directly caused the harm. So, maybe the hotel isn't responsible for the thief's criminal act.\n\nOption D says he will not prevail if the hotel used reasonable care in selecting the lock. So, if the hotel was careful in choosing the lock and it met the local ordinance standards, does that mean they used reasonable care? Probably. But does that mean the traveler won't prevail?\n\nLet me think about this more carefully.\n\nIn premises liability law, hotels have a duty to provide reasonable security measures to protect their guests from foreseeable harms, like crimes. If they fail to do so, and a guest is injured as a result, the hotel can be held liable.\n\nHere, the lock on the door met the local ordinance standards, which likely indicates that the hotel took reasonable steps to secure the room. So, if the lock was up to code, it suggests that the hotel exercised reasonable care in selecting the lock.\n\nBut, the thief still managed to pick the lock and enter the room. Does that mean the lock was inadequate? Well, locks can be picked, even if they meet security standards. It's not necessarily the hotel's fault that the thief was skilled enough to pick the lock.\n\nMoreover, the injury was directly caused by the thief's actions, not directly by any negligence of the hotel. So, the thief's actions might be seen as an intervening cause that breaks the chain of causation between any potential negligence of the hotel and the traveler's injuries.\n\nWait, but maybe the hotel has a duty to provide secure locks, and if the lock was inadequate, they could be liable. But in this case, the lock met the local ordinance standards, which are presumably set to ensure a certain level of security.\n\nPerhaps the hotel fulfilled its duty by installing a lock that meets the legal security standards, and therefore, they are not negligent.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes ordinances set minimum standards, and a higher standard might be required to fulfill the duty of care.\n\nBut in this scenario, since the lock complied with the ordinance, it's likely that the hotel met its duty to provide reasonable security.\n\nSo, if the hotel met its duty, and the injury was caused by an unforeseeable criminal act of a third party, then the hotel shouldn't be liable.\n\nTherefore, the traveler will not prevail, probably because the hotel used reasonable care in selecting the lock.\n\nSo, option D seems the most plausible answer.\n\nBut let me check again.\n\nIf the lock was defectively designed, as in option A, would the traveler prevail? Well, if the lock was defectively designed, that might be a different story. But the problem states that the lock fully complied with the local ordinance, which suggests that it was appropriately designed for security purposes. So, unless there's evidence that the lock was defective despite meeting the ordinance, I don't think option A applies.\n\nOption B says he will prevail because he was a business visitor. But the problem doesn't specify that he was a business visitor; he was just traveling. Moreover, being a business visitor might affect the level of duty the hotel owes, but in this case, since he's a guest, the hotel owes him a duty of care regardless.\n\nOption C mentions that the thief's act was an intervening cause. That could be a valid defense for the hotel, as the thief's criminal act was an independent event that caused the harm, potentially breaking the causal link between any negligence of the hotel and the traveler's injuries.\n\nHowever, option D seems more directly related to the issue at hand, which is the security provided by the lock.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is option D: the traveler will not prevail, if the hotel used reasonable care in selecting the lock.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
