                    "text": "So I've got this real estate situation here, and I need to figure out which answer is correct. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nThere's a purchaser who signed an agreement to buy some real estate. The agreement had a contingency clause that required him to make a completed application for a mortgage within a specified time, and it said that \"time was of the essence.\" That probably means that sticking to the timeline is really important in this contract.\n\nBut the purchaser didn't actually apply for the mortgage on time. Instead, he asked a mortgage broker friend for an opinion on whether he would qualify. Then, the seller told the purchaser that she was rescinding the sale because there was no mortgage application within the agreed time.\n\nA few days later, the purchaser made a belated application and received approval, but the seller still insisted on rescinding the contract. Now, the question is whether the seller will likely succeed in rescinding the transaction.\n\nOkay, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because the purchaser did not make a timely application and lost the protection of the contingency clause.\n\nHmm, this seems plausible. The contingency clause required a timely mortgage application, and he didn't do it on time. So, maybe the seller can back out because the purchaser didn't meet the condition.\n\nB. Yes, because she rescinded the sale prior to his notifying her of the approval \u2013 the first notice communicated is the effective one.\n\nThis one is a bit tricky. It seems to suggest that since the seller rescinded before the purchaser told her about the approval, the rescission stands. Maybe there's some rule about the timing of notices in contracts.\n\nC. No, because the amount of time that he was late was a \"de minimis\" delay that should not preclude him from the benefit of the bargain.\n\n\"De minimis\" means something like \"of minimal importance.\" So, this option is suggesting that the delay wasn't significant enough to justify rescinding the contract. Maybe the purchaser was only a day late or something, and that shouldn't be a big deal.\n\nD. No, because the original request to his mortgage broker friend was a timely application within the spirit of the agreement.\n\nThis one argues that even though the purchaser didn't formally apply on time, asking a mortgage broker for an opinion was enough to satisfy the spirit of the contingency clause. So, perhaps the seller can't rescind based on that.\n\nNow, I need to think about which one makes the most sense.\n\nFirst, the contract had a specific requirement for a timely mortgage application, and the purchaser didn't meet that requirement. He asked a friend who's a mortgage broker for an opinion instead of actually applying.\n\nBut was that request to the mortgage broker friend equivalent to making a mortgage application? It seems like he was just seeking advice, not submitting a formal application.\n\nSo, option D might not hold up because asking for an opinion isn't the same as submitting a completed application.\n\nOption A suggests that because he didn't make a timely application, he lost the protection of the contingency clause. That makes sense because the contingency clause was meant to protect both parties by ensuring that the purchaser could get financing.\n\nOption B is about the timing of the rescission notice. If the seller rescinded before the purchaser informed her of the approval, maybe that gives her the right to rescind. But I'm not sure about the specific rules regarding the sequence of notices in contract law.\n\nOption C brings up the idea of \"de minimis\" delay. If the delay was insignificant, perhaps the seller can't use it to rescind the contract. But I need to know how significant the delay was. If it was just a matter of days, maybe it's not a big deal, especially since the purchaser eventually got approved.\n\nHowever, the contract said \"time was of the essence,\" which probably means that the timing was crucial, and even a small delay could be significant.\n\nI think the key here is the \"time is of the essence\" clause. That usually means that meeting the deadlines is critical, and failing to do so can allow the other party to terminate the contract.\n\nSo, because the purchaser didn't apply on time, and the seller rescinded the contract before he provided the approval, it seems like the seller has the right to rescind.\n\nBut wait, the purchaser did apply later and got approved. Maybe the seller should honor the contract since the purchaser eventually got the financing.\n\nOn the other hand, the contract had a specific timeline, and he didn't meet it. So, perhaps the seller can walk away.\n\nI'm a bit torn between options A and B.\n\nOption A says yes because the purchaser didn't make a timely application and lost the protection of the contingency clause. That seems straightforward.\n\nOption B says yes because the seller rescinded before being notified of the approval, and the first notice is the effective one. This might be relevant in terms of contract law, where the first proper notice to rescind is effective.\n\nBut maybe both A and B are relevant. The purchaser didn't meet the contingency, and the seller rescinded before being notified of the approval.\n\nOption C argues that the delay was insignificant, but given the \"time is of the essence\" clause, even a small delay might be material.\n\nOption D claims that asking the mortgage broker friend was a timely application, but I don't think that's the case. Asking for an opinion isn't the same as submitting a formal application.\n\nSo, overall, I think the seller will likely prevail in rescinding the transaction. Either because of the purchaser's failure to make a timely application (option A) or because the rescission was communicated before the approval was notified (option B).\n\nBetween A and B, I think A is more directly related to the contingency clause and the \"time is of the essence\" provision. So, I'll go with option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
