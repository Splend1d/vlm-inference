                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about the Law of the Sea and Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs). I need to find out which statement is NOT correct. The options are:\n\nA. The EEZ extends up to 200 nautical miles (370 km) from the coastline.\n\nB. Countries have the right to exploit natural resources in their EEZ.\n\nC. Countries can exploit resources on the continental shelf extending up to 350 nautical miles (560 km) beyond their EEZ.\n\nD. A country does not have the right to exploit living resources in its EEZ.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what an EEZ is. I remember that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) defines the EEZ as an area where a coastal state has special rights over the exploration and use of marine resources, including both living and non-living resources. But wait, option D says that a country does not have the right to exploit living resources in its EEZ. That seems contradictory.\n\nLet me double-check. According to UNCLOS, within the EEZ, the coastal state has sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving, and managing the natural resources, whether living or non-living, of the waters superjacent to the seabed and its subsoil, and with regard to other activities for the economic exploitation and exploration of the zone, such as the production of energy from the water, currents, and winds.\n\nSo, that sounds like the country does have the right to exploit both living and non-living resources within its EEZ. Therefore, option D seems to be incorrect because it states that a country does not have the right to exploit living resources in its EEZ, whereas according to UNCLOS, they do have that right.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe there are some limitations or exceptions to that right. For example, there might be international agreements or regulations that restrict certain activities, but generally, under UNCLOS, coastal states have sovereign rights to exploit natural resources within their EEZ, including living resources like fish.\n\nAlright, so option D appears to be the incorrect statement. Now, let's quickly verify the other options to ensure they are correct.\n\nOption A: The EEZ extends up to 200 nautical miles (370 km) from the coastline. Yes, that's standard under UNCLOS. The EEZ typically starts from the baseline where the territorial sea begins, which is usually the low-water mark along the coast, and extends up to 200 nautical miles seaward.\n\nOption B: Countries have the right to exploit natural resources in their EEZ. As I mentioned earlier, this is correct under UNCLOS. They have sovereign rights to explore and exploit natural resources in their EEZ.\n\nOption C: Countries can exploit resources on the continental shelf extending up to 350 nautical miles (560 km) beyond their EEZ. Wait a minute, this seems a bit confusing. According to UNCLOS, the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles is subject to a different set of rules. The EEZ is up to 200 nautical miles, and beyond that, up to 350 nautical miles or 100 nautical miles beyond the 2500-meter depth contour, countries can claim an extended continental shelf. However, the rights here are different from those within the EEZ.\n\nOn the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, the coastal state has sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting the natural resources of the seabed and subsoil, but not the water column above. Also, there are specific procedures and obligations regarding the exploitation of resources in this area, including the requirement to submit data to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) to establish the outer limits of the continental shelf.\n\nSo, while countries can exploit resources on the continental shelf beyond their EEZ, the way it's phrased in option C might be a bit misleading because the EEZ itself only extends up to 200 nautical miles. Beyond that, it's the continental shelf, which has its own set of rules and limitations.\n\nHowever, compared to option D, which clearly contradicts UNCLOS regarding the exploitation of living resources within the EEZ, option C is less straightforward but still essentially correct in that countries can exploit resources on the continental shelf beyond their EEZ, provided they follow the necessary procedures and regulations.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT correct is option D: A country does not have the right to exploit living resources in its EEZ. In fact, they do have the right to exploit both living and non-living resources within their EEZ under UNCLOS.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
