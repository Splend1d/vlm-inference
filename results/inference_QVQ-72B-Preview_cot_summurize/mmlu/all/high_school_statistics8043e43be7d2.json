                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about the weights of packed boxes used for shipping books. There are a few different components to consider: the books, the boxes themselves, and the packing material. Each has its own mean weight and standard deviation, and I need to find the standard deviation of the total weight of the packed boxes.\n\nLet me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are books packed into boxes. The mean weight of books per box is 25 pounds, and the standard deviation is 2 pounds.\n\nThen, the boxes themselves have a mean weight of 1 pound with a standard deviation of 0.15 pounds.\n\nLastly, the packing material added per box has a mean weight of 2 pounds with a standard deviation of 0.25 pounds.\n\nSo, the total weight of a packed box would be the sum of the weight of the books, the weight of the box itself, and the weight of the packing material.\n\nI need to find the standard deviation of this total weight.\n\nI recall that when you have independent random variables and you add them together, the mean of the sum is the sum of the means, and the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\n- \\(X\\) = weight of books per box\n\n- \\(Y\\) = weight of the box itself\n\n- \\(Z\\) = weight of the packing material\n\nThen, the total weight \\(W\\) is:\n\n\\[W = X + Y + Z\\]\n\nThe mean of \\(W\\) would be:\n\n\\[\\mu_W = \\mu_X + \\mu_Y + \\mu_Z\\]\n\nAnd the variance of \\(W\\) would be:\n\n\\[\\sigma_W^2 = \\sigma_X^2 + \\sigma_Y^2 + \\sigma_Z^2\\]\n\nAssuming that all these variables are independent.\n\nFirst, let's find the means:\n\n\\[\\mu_X = 25 \\text{ pounds}\\]\\[\\mu_Y = 1 \\text{ pound}\\]\\[\\mu_Z = 2 \\text{ pounds}\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\\mu_W = 25 + 1 + 2 = 28 \\text{ pounds}\\]\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nNow, for the standard deviations, I have:\n\n\\[\\sigma_X = 2 \\text{ pounds}\\]\\[\\sigma_Y = 0.15 \\text{ pounds}\\]\\[\\sigma_Z = 0.25 \\text{ pounds}\\]\n\nThe variance is the square of the standard deviation, so:\n\n\\[\\sigma_X^2 = (2)^2 = 4\\]\\[\\sigma_Y^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225\\]\\[\\sigma_Z^2 = (0.25)^2 = 0.0625\\]\n\nThen, the variance of \\(W\\) is:\n\n\\[\\sigma_W^2 = 4 + 0.0225 + 0.0625 = 4.085\\]\n\nAnd the standard deviation of \\(W\\) is the square root of the variance:\n\n\\[\\sigma_W = \\sqrt{4.085} \\approx 2.021 \\text{ pounds}\\]\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 28.000 pounds\n\nB. 5.290 pounds\n\nC. 4.085 pounds\n\nD. 2.021 pounds\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. 2.021 pounds.\n\nBut wait a minute, I should double-check if all these variables are indeed independent. The problem doesn't specify any dependency between the weights of the books, the boxes, or the packing material, so it's reasonable to assume they are independent.\n\nAlso, I should confirm if there are any units issues, but all weights are in pounds, so that's consistent.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any other factors that could affect the total weight, like the number of books per box, but the problem states that it's the mean weight per box, so I think it's already accounted for.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this, just to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the total weight is a linear combination of the individual weights, and use the formula for the variance of a linear combination.\n\nFor independent variables, the formula is indeed:\n\n\\[\\text{Var}(aX + bY + cZ) = a^2 \\text{Var}(X) + b^2 \\text{Var}(Y) + c^2 \\text{Var}(Z)\\]\n\nIn this case, \\(a = b = c = 1\\), so it simplifies to:\n\n\\[\\text{Var}(W) = \\text{Var}(X) + \\text{Var}(Y) + \\text{Var}(Z)\\]\n\nWhich is what I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if there were correlations between the variables, I would need to account for covariance terms, but since they are independent, covariances are zero.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 2.021 pounds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
