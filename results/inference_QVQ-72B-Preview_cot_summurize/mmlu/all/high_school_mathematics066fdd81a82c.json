                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this function f(x) = 8x\u00b3 - 6x\u00b2 - 4x + 5, and I need to find the value of f(-2). Okay, so basically, I need to plug in -2 for x in the equation and calculate the result. I think I can do this, but I should be careful with the signs, especially with the negative two.\n\nFirst, I'll substitute x with -2 in each term.\n\nSo, the first term is 8x\u00b3. Let's calculate that.\n\n8 * (-2)\u00b3. Hmm, (-2)\u00b3 is -8 because negative two times negative two is positive four, and then times negative two again is negative eight.\n\nSo, 8 * (-8) = 8 * -8 = -64.\n\nAlright, that seems straightforward.\n\nNext, the second term is -6x\u00b2.\n\nSo, -6 * (-2)\u00b2. Wait, (-2)\u00b2 is positive four because negative two times negative two is positive four.\n\nThen, -6 * 4 = -24.\n\nOkay, that's the second term.\n\nMoving on to the third term, -4x.\n\nSo, -4 * (-2) = positive 8. Because a negative times a negative is positive.\n\nAnd finally, the constant term is +5.\n\nSo, now, I need to add all these up: -64 + (-24) + 8 + 5.\n\nLet me add the first two: -64 - 24. Well, 64 + 24 is 88, but since both are negative, it's -88.\n\nThen, -88 + 8 = -80.\n\nAnd finally, -80 + 5 = -75.\n\nSo, the value of f(-2) is -75.\n\nLet me just double-check that I did all the calculations correctly.\n\nFirst term: 8 * (-2)\u00b3 = 8 * (-8) = -64. That's right.\n\nSecond term: -6 * (-2)\u00b2 = -6 * 4 = -24. Correct.\n\nThird term: -4 * (-2) = +8. Yes.\n\nAnd the constant is +5.\n\nAdding them up: -64 - 24 is -88, plus 8 is -80, plus 5 is -75.\n\nYeah, I think that's correct.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 5\n\nB. -75\n\nC. -64\n\nD. -24\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. -75.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes there. If I did, I hope I can catch them now.\n\nWait, maybe I should try another way to verify.\n\nAlternatively, I could evaluate each term separately and then sum them up.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, calculate 8x\u00b3 when x = -2: 8 * (-8) = -64.\n\nSecond term: -6x\u00b2 when x = -2: -6 * 4 = -24.\n\nThird term: -4x when x = -2: -4 * (-2) = +8.\n\nAnd the constant term: +5.\n\nNow, sum them up: -64 + (-24) + 8 + 5.\n\nLet me add -64 and -24: that's -88.\n\nThen, -88 + 8 = -80.\n\nFinally, -80 + 5 = -75.\n\nSame result again. Seems consistent.\n\nMaybe I can also use the function evaluation step by step.\n\nf(-2) = 8*(-2)^3 - 6*(-2)^2 - 4*(-2) + 5\n\nFirst, (-2)^3 = -8.\n\nSo, 8*(-8) = -64.\n\nNext, (-2)^2 = 4.\n\nSo, -6*4 = -24.\n\nThen, -4*(-2) = +8.\n\nAnd finally, +5.\n\nAdding them up: -64 - 24 + 8 + 5.\n\nAgain, -64 - 24 is -88, plus 8 is -80, plus 5 is -75.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\nJust to be extra sure, maybe I can plug in x = -2 into the function using a calculator.\n\nBut since I don't have one right now, I'll assume that my manual calculation is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is -75, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-75} \\]"
