                    "text": "Alright, I've got this logic problem here. It says, \"All first-year students take a swim test.\" And I need to translate this statement into predicate logic from the given options. The options are:\n\nA. (\u2200x)(Sx \u2283 Fx)\n\nB. (\u2200x)(Fx \u2283 Sx)\n\nC. (\u2200x)(Fx \u2228 Sx)\n\nD. (\u2200x)(Fx \u2261 Sx)\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each symbol represents. I assume that:\n\n- Fx means \"x is a first-year student.\"\n\n- Sx means \"x takes a swim test.\"\n\nBut wait, let's make sure. The statement is \"All first-year students take a swim test.\" So, if something is a first-year student, then it takes a swim test.\n\nThat sounds like a conditional: If x is a first-year student, then x takes a swim test.\n\nIn logic, that's typically represented as Fx \u2283 Sx.\n\nBut there's a universal quantifier (\u2200x) in front, which means \"for all x,\" so it's (\u2200x)(Fx \u2283 Sx).\n\nLooking at the options, that would be option B.\n\nBut let me double-check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption A is (\u2200x)(Sx \u2283 Fx), which would mean \"For all x, if x takes a swim test, then x is a first-year student.\" That's different from the original statement, which says all first-year students take the test, not that only first-year students take the test.\n\nOption C is (\u2200x)(Fx \u2228 Sx), which means \"For all x, x is a first-year student or x takes a swim test.\" This allows for the possibility that some x's are not first-year students but still take the test, which isn't what the original statement says.\n\nOption D is (\u2200x)(Fx \u2261 Sx), which means \"For all x, x is a first-year student if and only if x takes a swim test.\" This implies that being a first-year student is both necessary and sufficient for taking the swim test, which is stronger than the original statement.\n\nSo, based on this, option B seems to be the correct translation of the statement \"All first-year students take a swim test.\"\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the domain of x. Is x a student or is x anything in general?\n\nIf x is anything in general, then saying (\u2200x)(Fx \u2283 Sx) would imply that if something is a first-year student, then it takes a swim test, even if x is not a student. But that seems odd because not everything is a student.\n\nPerhaps the domain is restricted to students. If that's the case, then (\u2200x)(Fx \u2283 Sx) would make sense, assuming x is a student.\n\nAlternatively, if the domain is all entities, then to specify that only students are being considered, the statement might need to include that x is a student.\n\nWait, but in standard predicate logic, the domain is specified separately, and the predicates are interpreted over that domain.\n\nAssuming the domain is students, then Fx is \"x is a first-year student,\" and Sx is \"x takes a swim test.\"\n\nSo, \"All first-year students take a swim test\" would be (\u2200x)(Fx \u2283 Sx), which is option B.\n\nOption A, (\u2200x)(Sx \u2283 Fx), would mean \"All students who take a swim test are first-year students,\" which is not what the original statement says.\n\nOption C, (\u2200x)(Fx \u2228 Sx), means \"Every student is either a first-year student or takes a swim test,\" which is different from the original statement.\n\nOption D, (\u2200x)(Fx \u2261 Sx), means \"Every student is a first-year student if and only if they take a swim test,\" which is too strong.\n\nTherefore, option B is indeed the correct translation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nIs there any possibility that \"first-year students\" includes only some first-year students, not all? No, the statement says \"all first-year students,\" so it's clearly referring to every student who is in their first year.\n\nAlso, \"take a swim test\" is straightforward\u2014there doesn't seem to be any ambiguity in that part.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, I'm confident that option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
