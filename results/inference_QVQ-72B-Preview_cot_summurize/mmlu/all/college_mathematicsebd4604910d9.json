                    "text": "So I have this problem about ideals in a ring. Let me see if I can figure this out. We have a ring R, and U and V are two-sided ideals of R. We need to determine which of the given options must also be ideals of R.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a two-sided ideal is. In a ring R, a subset I is called a two-sided ideal if it satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. I is an additive subgroup of R, meaning it's closed under addition and contains the additive inverse of each of its elements.\n\n2. I is closed under multiplication by any element of R from both sides. That is, for every r in R and every i in I, both r*i and i*r are in I.\n\nNow, we have three options to consider:\n\nI. {u + v : u \u2208 U and v \u2208 V}\n\nII. {uv : u \u2208 U and v \u2208 V}\n\nIII. {x : x \u2208 U and x \u2208 V}\n\nLet's consider each one separately.\n\nStarting with option I: {u + v : u \u2208 U and v \u2208 V}\n\nI need to check if this set is an ideal of R. To do that, I need to verify that it satisfies the two conditions of being a two-sided ideal.\n\nFirst, is it an additive subgroup? Well, U and V are both additive subgroups, so their sum should also be an additive subgroup. That is, if you take u1 + v1 and u2 + v2, their sum (u1 + u2) + (v1 + v2) should be in the set, which it is, since u1 + u2 is in U (because U is closed under addition) and v1 + v2 is in V. Also, the additive inverse of (u + v) should be in the set, which would be (-u) + (-v), and since U and V are additive subgroups, -u is in U and -v is in V.\n\nSecond, is it closed under multiplication by any element of R from both sides? Let's take r in R and s in R, and consider r*(u + v) and (u + v)*s.\n\nFor r*(u + v), since U and V are ideals, r*u is in U and r*v is in V, so their sum r*u + r*v should be in the set {u + v : u \u2208 U, v \u2208 V}.\n\nSimilarly, for (u + v)*s, u*s is in U and v*s is in V, so (u*s) + (v*s) is again in the set.\n\nTherefore, option I seems to be an ideal.\n\nMoving on to option II: {uv : u \u2208 U and v \u2208 V}\n\nAgain, I need to check if this set is an ideal.\n\nFirst, is it an additive subgroup? If I take uv and u'v', where u, u' are in U and v, v' are in V, is their sum uv + u'v' in the set? Not necessarily, because uv + u'v' doesn't directly fit the form uv for some u in U and v in V. Maybe not all elements of the form uv + u'v' can be expressed as a single uv, so this might not be closed under addition.\n\nMoreover, considering the additive inverse, if uv is in the set, is -uv also in the set? Well, -uv = (-u)v, and since U is an ideal, -u is in U. Similarly, v is in V. So -uv is also in the set. So it's closed under additive inverses.\n\nBut the bigger issue is with the closure under multiplication by elements of R.\n\nLet's take r in R and consider r*(uv), where u is in U and v is in V. Since U is an ideal, r*u is in U. Then (r*u)*v is in the set, since r*u is in U and v is in V. Similarly, u*(r*v) is in the set, since u is in U and r*v is in V (since V is an ideal). But is r*(uv) equal to (r*u)*v or u*(r*v)? Not necessarily, unless R is commutative, which we don't know.\n\nTherefore, this set might not be closed under multiplication by elements of R, so option II may not be an ideal.\n\nLastly, option III: {x : x \u2208 U and x \u2208 V}\n\nThis is simply the intersection of U and V, denoted by U \u2229 V.\n\nI need to check if U \u2229 V is an ideal of R.\n\nAgain, I need to verify the two conditions.\n\nFirst, is U \u2229 V an additive subgroup?\n\nSince both U and V are additive subgroups, their intersection is also an additive subgroup. This is a standard result: the intersection of subgroups is a subgroup.\n\nSecond, is U \u2229 V closed under multiplication by any element of R from both sides?\n\nTake r in R and x in U \u2229 V. Then, since x is in U and U is an ideal, r*x is in U. Similarly, since x is in V and V is an ideal, r*x is in V. Therefore, r*x is in U \u2229 V. The same argument applies to x*r.\n\nHence, U \u2229 V is also an ideal of R.\n\nSo, options I and III must be ideals of R, while option II may not necessarily be an ideal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. I and III only.\n\nWait a minute, but in some rings, option II might actually be an ideal. For example, if R is commutative, then UV = VU, and it should be an ideal. But since we don't know if R is commutative, I can't assume that.\n\nAlso, in some non-commutative rings, UV might still be an ideal, but that would depend on specific properties of U, V, and R, which are not given here. So, in general, I cannot assume that UV is an ideal.\n\nTherefore, the safe answer is that only I and III must be ideals of R.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
