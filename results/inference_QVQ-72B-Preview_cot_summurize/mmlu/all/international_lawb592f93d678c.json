                    "text": "So I have this question about the geographical scope of jurisdiction. It's asking what the ordinary geographical scope of jurisdiction is, and there are four options:\n\nA. Jurisdiction is ordinarily extra-territorial\n\nB. Jurisdiction is ordinarily on the high seas\n\nC. Jurisdiction is ordinarily territorial\n\nD. Jurisdiction is determined by the location of the offender.\n\nHmm, I need to think about this carefully.\n\nFirst off, jurisdiction refers to the legal authority that a court has to hear and decide a case. The geographical scope of jurisdiction determines where that authority extends.\n\nOption C says jurisdiction is ordinarily territorial. That sounds familiar. I think in most legal systems, jurisdiction is based on territory. Meaning, a country's courts have jurisdiction over crimes committed within its national borders. So, if someone commits a crime in France, French courts have jurisdiction over that crime.\n\nBut what about option A, which says jurisdiction is ordinarily extra-territorial? Extra-territorial means beyond one's territory. So, would that mean a country can exercise jurisdiction over actions that happen outside its borders? Well, sometimes that happens, like in cases of universal jurisdiction where certain crimes can be prosecuted by any country regardless of where they were committed, but that's more of an exception rather than the rule, I think.\n\nOption B mentions jurisdiction is ordinarily on the high seas. The high seas are areas of the ocean that are not within any country's territorial waters. There is international law that governs the high seas, like the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. But generally, ships are subject to the jurisdiction of their flag state, right? So, it's not that jurisdiction is ordinarily on the high seas, but rather that each ship is subject to its flag state's jurisdiction.\n\nOption D says jurisdiction is determined by the location of the offender. That seems a bit vague. If the offender is in one country when they're caught, but the crime was committed in another country, which jurisdiction applies? I think it's more about where the crime was committed or where the effects of the crime were felt.\n\nWait a minute, there's the principle of territoriality and the principle of nationality. The territoriality principle says that a state has jurisdiction over crimes committed within its territory, regardless of the nationality of the perpetrator or the victim. The nationality principle allows a state to exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed by its nationals, even if they were committed abroad.\n\nSo, combining these principles, it seems that territorial jurisdiction is primary, and nationality jurisdiction is additional.\n\nBut going back to the question, it's about the ordinary geographical scope of jurisdiction. Ordinary suggests what is most common or typical.\n\nI would say that the most common scope of jurisdiction is territorial, meaning within a state's own borders. That would make sense because that's where the state has direct control and authority.\n\nOption C seems the most straightforward answer here.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other perspective I should think about. For example, in international law, there might be cases where jurisdiction extends beyond territorial limits, but those are exceptions, not the rule.\n\nAlso, in civil law, sometimes courts have jurisdiction based on where the defendant resides or where the plaintiff resides, but again, that's more about personal jurisdiction rather than geographical jurisdiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to distinguish between criminal and civil jurisdiction.\n\nIn criminal law, jurisdiction is often based on where the crime was committed or where the offender is found.\n\nIn civil law, jurisdiction might be based on where the parties are located or where the events giving rise to the lawsuit occurred.\n\nBut the question is about the geographical scope of jurisdiction in general, so probably it's referring to criminal jurisdiction.\n\nIn that case, territoriality is indeed the primary basis for jurisdiction.\n\nLet me see if there's any other factor to consider.\n\nIs there a difference between domestic jurisdiction and international jurisdiction?\n\nDomestically, each state exercises jurisdiction over its own territory.\n\nInternationally, jurisdiction can be more complex, involving treaties and international agreements that may allow for extraterritorial jurisdiction in certain cases.\n\nBut again, these are exceptions to the general rule of territorial jurisdiction.\n\nMaybe I should look at some examples.\n\nSuppose someone commits a robbery in Country A and flees to Country B. Normally, Country A's courts would have jurisdiction over the robbery because that's where the crime was committed.\n\nCountry B might also have jurisdiction if the offender is a national of Country B, but that's secondary to the territorial principle.\n\nAnother example: if a crime is committed on the high seas, like piracy, then the flag state of the ship has jurisdiction, and possibly other states under certain international laws.\n\nBut again, this is a specific scenario, not the general rule.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, it seems that the ordinary geographical scope of jurisdiction is territorial.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me check the other options once more.\n\nOption A: jurisdiction is ordinarily extra-territorial. Well, extra-territorial jurisdiction is not the norm; it's an exception.\n\nOption B: jurisdiction is ordinarily on the high seas. No, jurisdiction on the high seas is governed differently, and it's not the ordinary scope.\n\nOption D: jurisdiction is determined by the location of the offender. While this can be a factor in some jurisdictions, especially in extradition cases, it's not the primary or ordinary basis for jurisdiction.\n\nHence, the best answer is C: jurisdiction is ordinarily territorial.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
