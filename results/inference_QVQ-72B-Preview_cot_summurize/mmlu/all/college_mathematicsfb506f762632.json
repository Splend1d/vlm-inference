                    "text": "So I've got this function \\(f(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 + 3xy\\) and I need to find out about its critical points. The problem says there exist distinct points P and Q where f has either local maxima, saddle points, or local minima, and I need to figure out which of these options A, B, C, or D correctly describes the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the gradient of the function is zero, meaning both partial derivatives with respect to x and y are zero.\n\nSo, let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n\\[\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 + 3y\\]\n\n\\[\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 3y^2 + 3x\\]\n\nNow, set both partial derivatives to zero to find the critical points:\n\n\\[3x^2 + 3y = 0\\]\\[3y^2 + 3x = 0\\]\n\nI can simplify these equations by dividing both sides by 3:\n\n\\[x^2 + y = 0 \\implies y = -x^2\\]\\[y^2 + x = 0 \\implies y^2 = -x\\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( y = -x^2 \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[(-x^2)^2 + x = 0\\]\\[x^4 + x = 0\\]\\[x(x^3 + 1) = 0\\]\n\nSo, \\( x = 0 \\) or \\( x^3 = -1 \\), which gives \\( x = -1 \\).\n\nPlugging these back into \\( y = -x^2 \\):\n\nIf \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( y = -0^2 = 0 \\).\n\nIf \\( x = -1 \\), then \\( y = -(-1)^2 = -1 \\).\n\nSo, the critical points are \\( (0, 0) \\) and \\( (-1, -1) \\).\n\nNow, I need to determine the nature of these critical points. To do this, I'll use the second partial derivative test.\n\nFirst, compute the second partial derivatives:\n\n\\[\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 6x\\]\\[\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 6y\\]\\[\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 3\\]\n\nThe Hessian determinant is:\n\n\\[D = \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\right)^2 = (6x)(6y) - (3)^2 = 36xy - 9\\]\n\nNow, evaluate D at each critical point.\n\nFirst, at \\( (0, 0) \\):\n\n\\[D = 36(0)(0) - 9 = -9\\]\n\nSince \\( D < 0 \\), this indicates a saddle point.\n\nNext, at \\( (-1, -1) \\):\n\n\\[D = 36(-1)(-1) - 9 = 36 - 9 = 27\\]\n\nSince \\( D > 0 \\), and \\( \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 6(-1) = -6 < 0 \\), this is a local maximum.\n\nSo, at \\( (0, 0) \\), we have a saddle point, and at \\( (-1, -1) \\), we have a local maximum.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C: a local maximum at P and a saddle point at Q.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the partial derivatives seem correct:\n\n\\[\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 + 3y\\]\\[\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 3y^2 + 3x\\]\n\nSetting them to zero and solving for x and y gave the critical points \\( (0,0) \\) and \\( (-1,-1) \\), which seems right.\n\nThe second partial derivatives are:\n\n\\[\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 6x\\]\\[\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 6y\\]\\[\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 3\\]\n\nThe Hessian determinant \\( D = 36xy - 9 \\), which was evaluated correctly at both points.\n\nAt \\( (0,0) \\), \\( D = -9 < 0 \\), which is a saddle point.\n\nAt \\( (-1,-1) \\), \\( D = 27 > 0 \\), and \\( \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = -6 < 0 \\), which confirms a local maximum.\n\nSo, yes, option C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
