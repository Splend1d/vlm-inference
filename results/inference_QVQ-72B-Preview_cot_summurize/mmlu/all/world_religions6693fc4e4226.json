                    "text": "So I'm trying to answer this question about Guru Nanak and the term he used to denote the \"divine word\" as part of divine revelation. The options are Shabad, Khalse, Nam, and Guru. Hmm, I need to recall which one refers to the divine word.\n\nFirst, I should remember that Guru Nanak was the first Sikh Guru and the founder of Sikhism. His teachings are central to the religion, and I know that in Sikhism, there's a strong emphasis on the divine word or the holy scripture.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Shabad: I think Shabad refers to the divine word or the sacred sound in Sikhism. It's often used in the context of Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture, where the teachings are considered the word of the Guru.\n\nB. Khalse: I believe Khalse refers to the Sikh military order founded by Guru Gobind Singh. It's about the community of initiated Sikhs who have taken baptism. So, that seems more related to the community structure rather than the divine word.\n\nC. Nam: This term is used in various religions, including Sikhism, where it refers to the name of God or the divine being. It's also related to the practice of meditating on God's name. While it is an important concept in Sikhism, I'm not sure if it specifically denotes the divine word as revealed knowledge.\n\nD. Guru: This is a significant term in Sikhism, referring to the spiritual teacher or guide. The Guru is considered the embodiment of divine knowledge and guidance. However, I don't think it directly refers to the divine word in the sense of revealed scripture.\n\nGiven these considerations, Shabad seems the most appropriate choice because it specifically refers to the divine word or the sacred teachings that are part of divine revelation. In Sikhism, the Guru Granth Sahib is considered the final and eternal Guru, and the Shabad contained within it is seen as the word of the Guru himself.\n\nLet me double-check this. I recall that in Sikh worship, the recitation of Shabad is a central practice. It's believed that through the Shabad, one can connect with the divine. Therefore, Shabad is indeed the term used to denote the divine word as part of divine revelation in Sikhism.\n\nI think the correct answer is A. Shabad.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Shabad}} \\]"
