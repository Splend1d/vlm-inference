                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which statement about conversion is not true. Let me first make sure I understand what conversion is. From what I recall, conversion is a tort that involves interfering with someone's property rights in a personal chattel, like personal property. It's when someone takes or uses another person's property in a way that's so significant that it's like they're treating it as their own.\n\nOption A says that conversion is an interference with another's right of possession so severe as to warrant the defendant to pay the full price of the chattel. That sounds right because in conversion cases, the damages often equate to the value of the property if the property can't be returned.\n\nOption B says that the intent is to do the act that brings about the interference. I know that intent is a key element in conversion. You have to mean to interfere with the property, but not necessarily intend the specific harm. So, this seems accurate.\n\nOption C says the remedy is recovery of actual damages from harm to the chattel or loss of use. This seems a bit confusing. While actual damages for harm to the chattel might be recoverable, I thought that in conversion, the primary remedy is either getting the property back or getting its full value if it's been sold or destroyed. Loss of use might be part of it, but I'm not sure if that's the main remedy.\n\nOption D says the remedy is a damage award of the fair market value of the chattel. This seems consistent with what I've learned about conversion. If someone converts your property, you can get the value of the property as compensation.\n\nComparing options C and D, it seems like D is more precise about the remedy in conversion cases. C mentions actual damages from harm to the chattel or loss of use, but in conversion, the core remedy is typically the value of the property itself, not just damages for harm or loss of use.\n\nLet me double-check that. If someone converts my laptop, for example, selling it without my permission, the remedy would be the value of the laptop, not just the repair costs if it was damaged or some loss of use during the time I didn't have it.\n\nSo, option C seems to be missing the main point about the remedy in conversion, which is getting the value of the property.\n\nOption A is correct because conversion does involve severe interference that can lead to paying the full price of the chattel.\n\nOption B is correct because intent to interfere is required.\n\nOption D is correct because the fair market value is a standard measure of damages in conversion cases.\n\nTherefore, option C is not true about conversion because the primary remedy is not just recovery of actual damages from harm to the chattel or loss of use; it's the value of the chattel itself.\n\nI think that's the answer: option C is not true about conversion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
