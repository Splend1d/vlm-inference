The options are naturalistic observation, survey, controlled experiment, and quasi-experiment. Let me think about each one.\n\nFirst, naturalistic observation sounds like watching people or animals in their natural settings without interfering. So, if Jyoti is just watching people in line without affecting them or asking them questions, that might fit. But let's check the other options to be sure.\n\nSurvey usually involves asking people questions, like through questionnaires or interviews. Does Jyoti seem to be doing that? It doesn't say she's asking questions, just noting behavior. So, probably not a survey.\n\nControlled experiment is when you manipulate variables and control conditions to see cause and effect. Like, maybe changing the waiting time or something and seeing how people react. But here, it seems like she's just observing without changing anything.\n\nQuasi-experiment is similar to a controlled experiment but without random assignment or control over variables. It's more about observing existing groups and seeing differences. Maybe like comparing different concert lines that already exist. But again, it seems like she's just observing one line.\n\nGiven that, naturalistic observation seems to fit best. She's observing people in a natural situation, waiting in line for tickets, without interfering or changing the environment. No manipulation of variables or asking questions, just watching and noting behavior.\n\nI think the answer is A. naturalistic observation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
