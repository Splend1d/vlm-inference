                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a man who owns a hotel and a salesperson who sells hotel equipment, specifically fire extinguishers. They're trying to make a deal, and there's some back and forth about the terms. Then, the salesperson claims that there's no enforceable contract because of the statute of frauds under the UCC. I need to figure out which statement about the salesperson's defense is accurate.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand what's happening here. The man owns a hotel and receives a call from a salesperson offering to sell him 1,000 fire extinguishers for $35 each, totaling $35,000, with payment due 90 days after delivery. The salesperson promises to install them by April 15. The man accepts this offer the next day, on March 16.\n\nBut then, on March 17, the man sends a memo saying he wants to take a 15% discount if he pays in cash seven days after installation. The salesperson receives this on March 20. On April 1, the salesperson sends a telegram saying that there's no enforceable contract and won't be delivering the fire extinguishers on April 15 or any other time.\n\nNow, the man is suing the salesperson for breach of contract, and the salesperson is using the statute of frauds under the UCC as a defense. I need to evaluate the options:\n\nA. The salesperson's defense is valid because the man's memo wasn't sufficient to indicate that a contract was formed.\n\nB. The salesperson's defense is valid because the man's memo was inconsistent with the terms of the salesperson's oral offer.\n\nC. The salesperson's defense is not valid because the salesperson failed to respond to the man's memo within a reasonable period of time.\n\nD. The salesperson's defense is not valid because under the UCC, the statute of frauds is not applicable in agreements between merchants.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, under the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code), which governs sales of goods, there are specific rules about forming contracts, especially when it comes to merchants.\n\nBoth the man and the salesperson seem to be merchants: the man owns a hotel, which is a business, and the salesperson is a distributor of hotel equipment. So, this is a transaction between merchants.\n\nNow, the UCC has a statute of frauds provision, which generally requires that contracts for the sale of goods priced at $500 or more must be in writing to be enforceable. In this case, the total is $35,000, which is well above $500, so a written confirmation is needed.\n\nThe salesperson made an oral offer, and the man accepted it orally. Then, the man sent a memo, which seems like an attempt to confirm the agreement in writing. However, the memo included different terms regarding payment and discount.\n\nSo, the question is, does this memo serve as a sufficient written confirmation of the contract? And does the salesperson's failure to object to the different terms in the memo within a reasonable time make the contract enforceable?\n\nLet me look at option D first. It says that the salesperson's defense is not valid because under the UCC, the statute of frauds is not applicable in agreements between merchants. That doesn't sound right. The UCC does apply the statute of frauds to contracts between merchants for the sale of goods over $500. So, I think option D is incorrect.\n\nOption C says that the salesperson's defense is not valid because they failed to respond to the man's memo within a reasonable period of time. Under the UCC, when merchants exchange confirmations that have additional or different terms, there are rules about how to handle that.\n\nSpecifically, unless otherwise agreed, the additional terms are proposed additions to the contract. Between merchants, such additional terms become part of the contract unless:\n\n- The offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer.\n\n- The additional terms materially alter the contract.\n\n- The offeror objects to the additional terms in a reasonable time.\n\nIn this case, the salesperson did object by sending a telegram on April 1, saying there's no enforceable contract. The man sent the memo on March 17, and the salesperson responded on April 1, which might be considered a reasonable time, depending on the circumstances.\n\nHowever, the salesperson's telegram says there's no enforceable contract because of the statute of frauds. So, they're arguing that the contract isn't enforceable because it's not properly memorialized in writing.\n\nBut, under the UCC, even if there's no complete written agreement, partial performance or acceptance of goods can make the contract enforceable. Also, the UCC allows for the enforcement of agreements based on confirmatory memos exchanged between merchants.\n\nIn this scenario, the man sent a memo confirming the agreement, even though he added a new term about the discount and payment terms. The salesperson received this memo but didn't immediately object to the additional term. Instead, they waited until April 1 to say there's no enforceable contract.\n\nOption A says that the salesperson's defense is valid because the man's memo wasn't sufficient to indicate that a contract was formed. But, under the UCC, a written confirmation that states the quantity and is signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought can be sufficient to satisfy the writing requirement, even if it includes additional terms.\n\nIn this case, the man's memo seems to reference the agreement to buy 1,000 fire extinguishers for $35,000, and proposes a payment term with a discount. So, it does state the quantity and the price, which are key elements required by the statute of frauds.\n\nOption B says that the salesperson's defense is valid because the man's memo was inconsistent with the terms of the salesperson's oral offer. But, under the UCC, between merchants, additional terms in a confirmation can become part of the contract unless they materially alter the agreement or the offeror objects timely.\n\nIn this case, the man's memo proposes a different payment term with a discount, which could be considered a material alteration. However, the salesperson didn't object immediately and instead waited until April 1 to respond.\n\nUnder UCC 2-207, if additional terms are proposed by the acceptor (the man), and the offeror (the salesperson) doesn't accept them, then there's no contract unless the original offer specified that acceptance must be on the offeror's terms.\n\nBut, in this scenario, the salesperson's original offer was oral, and there's no indication that it specified that acceptance must be on their terms only.\n\nMoreover, the man's memo was sent on March 17, and the salesperson received it on March 20. They didn't respond until April 1, which might be considered a reasonable time, but by that point, the installation date was approaching.\n\nPerhaps, if the salesperson wanted to object to the additional terms, they should have done so promptly upon receiving the memo.\n\nGiven that, it seems that the salesperson's delay in responding might prevent them from now claiming that there's no enforceable contract.\n\nTherefore, option C seems plausible: the salesperson's defense is not valid because they failed to respond to the man's memo within a reasonable period of time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the man's memo served as a written confirmation of the contract, and the salesperson's failure to object timely means that the additional term (the discount) becomes part of the contract.\n\nIn that case, there is an enforceable contract, and the salesperson's refusal to perform is a breach.\n\nSo, I think option C is the correct answer: the salesperson's defense is not valid because they failed to respond to the man's memo within a reasonable period of time.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the memo does satisfy the writing requirement of the statute of frauds.\n\nOption B is incorrect because, even if the memo included additional terms, the salesperson didn't timely object, so those terms may have become part of the contract.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the statute of frauds does apply to contracts between merchants for the sale of goods over $500.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
