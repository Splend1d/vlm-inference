                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about consumer rights. It says that traditionally, consumer rights were based on the notion of _______ or _______, where the responsibility lay with the consumer to avoid subpar products. But this idea has been eroding because of increased ________ at a ________, EU, and UN level.\n\nFirst, I need to fill in those blanks. The first two blanks seem to be about a principle or doctrine related to buying and selling. I think \"caveat emptor\" is a Latin phrase that means \"let the buyer beware.\" So, it's basically saying that the buyer should be careful and check the product before buying because the seller might not disclose everything. So, option B has \"caveat emptor\" and \"buyer beware,\" which sound like the same thing.\n\nOption A has \"caveat emptor\" and \"company responsibility,\" but that seems contradictory because caveat emptor is about the buyer being cautious, not the company being responsible.\n\nOption C has \"cemptor eaveat,\" which looks like a misspelling of \"caveat emptor.\" Maybe it's a typo.\n\nOption D also has \"cemptor eaveat\" and \"company responsibility,\" which again seems inconsistent with the traditional notion.\n\nSo, probably, the correct first two blanks are \"caveat emptor\" and \"buyer beware.\"\n\nNow, the third blank is about increased something at a certain level, and the fourth blank specifies the level, like national, EU, and UN.\n\nOption A mentions \"informal codes\" at an international level.\n\nOption B says \"regulation\" at a national level.\n\nOption C repeats the same as option B.\n\nOption D says \"informal codes\" at an international level.\n\nGiven that the erosion of the caveat emptor principle is likely due to more formal regulations and laws rather than informal codes, option B seems plausible.\n\nBut wait, the question mentions increased something at a national, EU, and UN level. The EU is a regional organization, not a national entity, and the UN is international. So, if the third blank is \"regulation,\" and the fourth is \"national,\" that doesn't align because the EU and UN are not national levels.\n\nOption A has \"informal codes\" at an international level, which could include the UN, but the EU is regional, not purely international.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the increased something is awareness or protection, but those aren't options.\n\nLooking back, perhaps the third blank is \"regulation,\" and the fourth is \"national,\" but that doesn't fit because the EU and UN are higher levels.\n\nWait, maybe the third blank is \"regulation,\" and the fourth is \"international,\" but in option B, it's \"national.\"\n\nOption D has \"informal codes\" at an international level, which could include the EU and UN.\n\nBut informal codes seem less likely to erode a legal principle like caveat emptor. Formal regulations and laws are more likely to do that.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the options. Or perhaps the correct answer isn't listed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third blank is \"protection,\" but that's not in the options.\n\nLet me see if I can rephrase the question to myself.\n\nTraditionally, consumer rights were based on caveat emptor or buyer beware, meaning the buyer had to be careful. But over time, this has changed due to increased regulation or protection at various levels.\n\nSo, the third blank is likely \"regulation\" or \"protection,\" and the fourth is about the level, which is national, EU, and UN.\n\nBut in the options, only option B has \"regulation\" at a \"national\" level, but that doesn't cover EU and UN.\n\nOption A has \"informal codes\" at an \"international\" level, which could encompass EU and UN, but \"informal codes\" seem less impactful than formal regulations.\n\nOption C is similar to B but with a misspelled caveat emptor.\n\nOption D has \"informal codes\" at an \"international\" level, similar to A.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is B, even though it specifies \"national\" level, and the EU and UN are not national.\n\nMaybe the idea is that regulation at the national level has been influenced by EU and UN levels, so by extension, it's still related.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. This question is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third blank is \"awareness\" and the fourth is \"international,\" but that's not in the options.\n\nI think the best answer is B: caveat emptor, buyer beware, regulation, national.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because the levels don't perfectly align, as EU and UN are not national.\n\nMaybe I need to choose the option that comes closest to matching the blanks, and B seems the closest.\n\nSo, I'll go with B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
