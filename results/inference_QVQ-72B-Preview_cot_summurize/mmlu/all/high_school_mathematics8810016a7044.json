                    "text": "So I need to figure out how many diagonals are in a regular octagon. An octagon has 8 sides, right? And a diagonal is a line that connects two non-adjacent vertices. So, if I can find a formula for that, that would be great.\n\nI remember there's a formula for the number of diagonals in a polygon. Let me think... For an n-sided polygon, the number of diagonals should be n(n-3)/2. Yeah, that sounds familiar. Let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it this way: for each vertex, I can connect it to n-3 other vertices to make a diagonal because I can't connect it to itself or its two adjacent vertices.\n\nSo, for an octagon, n = 8. Plugging into the formula, it would be 8(8-3)/2 = 8*5/2 = 20.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me see if there's another way to confirm this.\n\nLet's try counting them manually for a smaller polygon where it's easier to visualize. Take a square, for example. A square has 4 sides, and the number of diagonals should be 2, which matches the formula: 4(4-3)/2 = 4*1/2 = 2. Okay, that checks out.\n\nNow, a pentagon has 5 sides. According to the formula, the number of diagonals should be 5(5-3)/2 = 5*2/2 = 5. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nMoving on to a hexagon, which has 6 sides. The number of diagonals should be 6(6-3)/2 = 6*3/2 = 9. I think that's correct.\n\nNow, a heptagon has 7 sides. So, 7(7-3)/2 = 7*4/2 = 14 diagonals. That also seems plausible.\n\nFinally, the octagon with 8 sides should have 8(8-3)/2 = 8*5/2 = 20 diagonals. So, according to the formula, the answer should be 20.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can try to visualize or draw an octagon and count the diagonals myself. Let's see, an octagon has 8 sides, and from each vertex, I can draw a diagonal to the 5 non-adjacent vertices.\n\nWait, no, actually, from each vertex in an octagon, I can draw diagonals to 5 other vertices because there are 8 total vertices minus the vertex itself and its two adjacent vertices, which is 8 - 1 - 2 = 5.\n\nSo, if I have 8 vertices, and each connects to 5 others via diagonals, that would give me 8 * 5 = 40 diagonals. But that can't be right because each diagonal connects two vertices, so I must have counted each diagonal twice\u2014once from each endpoint.\n\nTherefore, the actual number of diagonals is 40 / 2 = 20, which matches the formula's result.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the combination formula. The number of ways to choose 2 vertices out of 8 is C(8,2), which is 8!/(2!(8-2)!) = (8*7*6!)/(2*1*6!) = (8*7)/2 = 28. But this counts all possible lines between vertices, including the sides of the octagon.\n\nSince an octagon has 8 sides, the number of diagonals would be C(8,2) - 8 = 28 - 8 = 20. Again, this confirms the earlier result.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I end up with 20 diagonals in a regular octagon.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 8\n\nB. 16\n\nC. 17\n\nD. 20\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 20.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check one more time. If I have 8 vertices and each connects to 5 others with diagonals, total initial count is 40, divided by 2 to account for double counting, gives 20. Yes, that seems consistent.\n\nAdditionally, considering that in a regular polygon, the diagonals are symmetrically placed, and there shouldn't be any overlapping or missing diagonals in my count.\n\nThus, I am confident that the answer is 20 diagonals in a regular octagon.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
