                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question about surveying people at a shopping mall to get the most representative sample. The options are:\n\nA. Conducting the survey at one shoe store\n\nB. Conducting the survey at all shoe stores\n\nC. Conducting the survey at the entrance to the mall\n\nD. Conducting the survey a mile away from the mall\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which of these options would give the best representation of all the people who shop at the mall.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what a representative sample is. I think it means that the sample should reflect the characteristics of the entire population. So, in this case, the population is all the people who shop at the mall, and the sample is the group of people they survey.\n\nOption A is conducting the survey at one shoe store. But, not all shoppers go to the shoe store, right? Some people might just shop for clothes or electronics or something else. So, if I survey only at the shoe store, I might miss out on people who shop elsewhere in the mall. That seems like it could introduce bias.\n\nOption B is conducting the survey at all shoe stores. This might be better than just one, but it's still focusing only on shoe stores. It's similar to option A in that it's limiting the survey to a specific type of store. So, I'm thinking that this might not be the best approach either because it still doesn't capture the entire mall-shopping population.\n\nOption C is conducting the survey at the entrance to the mall. This seems more promising. People enter the mall from the entrances, so if they survey people as they come in, they might catch a wider range of shoppers. This could include people who are there for different types of stores, whether they're shopping for shoes, clothes, food, or anything else.\n\nOption D is conducting the survey a mile away from the mall. That seems a bit odd. People might be going to the mall or leaving, but it's not directly where the shoppers are. It might not be as representative because it could include people who are just passing by and not actually shopping at the mall.\n\nSo, comparing these options, I think option C\u2014conducting the survey at the entrance to the mall\u2014is the best choice for getting a representative sample. It's where all shoppers have to pass through to enter the mall, so it's more likely to capture a diverse group of shoppers compared to surveying at specific types of stores or a location far away from the mall.\n\nBut, just to make sure, let me think about some possible drawbacks of option C. For example, if the mall has multiple entrances, surveying at only one entrance might not be sufficient. However, the question says \"at the entrance to the mall,\" which could imply all entrances, but it's a bit ambiguous. Maybe I should consider whether it's all entrances or just one.\n\nIf it's all entrances, that would be even better because it ensures coverage of all incoming shoppers. If it's just one entrance, it might still be a good option, assuming that shoppers use that entrance proportionally to others.\n\nComparatively, surveying at shoe stores, whether one or all, is likely to skew towards shoppers interested in shoes, which may not represent the entire shopping population. And surveying a mile away from the mall seems too removed from the actual shopping experience.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that option C, conducting the survey at the entrance to the mall, would give the most representative sample of the people who shop at the mall.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
