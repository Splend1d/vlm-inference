                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand Stevenson's response to the objection that his theory doesn't account for objective goodness that's known a priori. Let me first make sure I understand what Stevenson's theory is about.\n\nStevenson is known for his emotivist theory of ethics, which suggests that moral statements don't express factual claims but rather emotional attitudes or prescriptions. So, when someone says \"X is good,\" they're not making a statement that can be true or false in the same way that \"the sky is blue\" is true or false. Instead, they're expressing their approval of X or trying to persuade others to approve of X.\n\nNow, the objection here is that his theory doesn't account for objective goodness\u2014that is, goodness that exists independently of human feelings or opinions and can be known a priori, meaning without relying on experience or empirical evidence.\n\nSo, the question is, how does Stevenson respond to this criticism? The options are:\n\nA. He claims to have proven that such a property does not exist.\n\nB. He claims to have offered an account of just such a property.\n\nC. He claims he does not understand such a property.\n\nD. None of the above.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, Stevenson is an emotivist, and emotivism generally denies that moral statements have truth-value or correspond to some objective reality. Instead, they are expressions of emotion or prescriptions.\n\nSo, if someone objects that his theory doesn't account for objective goodness, which implies that there is such a thing as objective goodness, Stevenson might deny the premise that there is such a thing in the first place.\n\nOption A says he claims to have proven that such a property does not exist. That seems plausible because emotivists like Stevenson might argue that moral properties are not objective in that sense.\n\nBut wait, has Stevenson actually claimed to have proven that objective goodness doesn't exist? I need to recall if he made such a strong assertion.\n\nOption B says he claims to have offered an account of just such a property. But that seems contradictory because if he's an emotivist, he's arguing that moral statements are expressions of emotion or prescriptions, not descriptions of objective properties.\n\nOption C says he claims he does not understand such a property. That's different\u2014it's not denying the existence of objective goodness but rather expressing ignorance or incomprehension about it.\n\nI need to recall Stevenson's specific response to this objection.\n\nLet me consider what emotivists in general say about objective moral properties. Emotivists typically hold that moral statements don't express propositions that can be true or false, so they might argue that there are no objective moral facts to be known a priori.\n\nHowever, saying that they don't express propositions isn't the same as proving that objective moral properties don't exist. It's more about the function of moral language.\n\nSo, perhaps Stevenson doesn't claim to have proven that objective goodness doesn't exist, but rather that moral statements aren't the way to access such properties, if they exist.\n\nBut the question is specifically about his response to the objection that his theory doesn't account for objective goodness.\n\nMaybe he accepts that his theory doesn't account for objective goodness because he doesn't believe in objective goodness in the first place.\n\nBut again, does he claim to have proven that objective goodness doesn't exist?\n\nI'm a bit unsure here. Perhaps he doesn't claim to have proven it, but he does argue that his theory doesn't need to account for it because it doesn't exist.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he acknowledges that there might be objective moral properties, but his theory isn't intended to account for them.\n\nLet me consider the context. If someone objects that his theory doesn't account for objective goodness, Stevenson might respond by saying that his theory is about the function of moral language, not about the nature of moral properties themselves.\n\nSo, perhaps he would say that his theory doesn't claim to account for objective goodness because it's not its purpose to do so.\n\nBut that's not exactly what the options are suggesting.\n\nOption A seems close: he claims to have proven that such a property does not exist.\n\nBut I'm not sure if Stevenson went that far.\n\nOption B: he claims to have offered an account of just such a property.\n\nThat seems inconsistent with emotivism, as emotivism is about expressing attitudes or prescriptions, not describing objective properties.\n\nOption C: he claims he does not understand such a property.\n\nThat might be a possible response, but it seems a bit weak. Philosophers often deal with concepts they don't fully understand but still engage with them.\n\nMaybe Stevenson does understand the concept of objective goodness but argues that his theory isn't meant to handle it.\n\nBut the question is about his response to the objection that his theory doesn't account for it.\n\nPerhaps he acknowledges that his theory doesn't account for objective goodness and that's fine because his theory is about something else.\n\nBut none of the options directly say that.\n\nOption D is \"none of the above,\" which might be a safe bet if I'm unsure.\n\nBut let me think differently.\n\nIf Stevenson is an emotivist, and emotivism holds that moral statements are expressions of emotion or prescriptions, then his theory doesn't aim to account for objective moral properties.\n\nSo, if someone objects that his theory doesn't account for objective goodness, he might respond by saying that his theory isn't intended to do that.\n\nBut again, that's not one of the options.\n\nOption A suggests that he claims to have proven that objective goodness doesn't exist.\n\nThat seems strong, and I don't recall Stevenson making such a claim.\n\nHe might argue that there's no good reason to believe in objective goodness, but proving its non-existence is another matter.\n\nOption B says he claims to have offered an account of just such a property.\n\nBut that would contradict his emotivist position, as emotivism isn't about describing objective properties but about expressing attitudes.\n\nOption C says he claims he does not understand such a property.\n\nThat might be a possible response, but it seems unlikely that Stevenson wouldn't understand the concept of objective goodness, given his engagement with ethical theory.\n\nPerhaps he understands the concept but argues that his theory isn't the right tool to handle it.\n\nAgain, that's not directly addressed in the options.\n\nSo, maybe the answer is D, none of the above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Stevenson does claim to have offered an account of objective goodness through his theory, but that seems contradictory to emotivism.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about it differently.\n\nPerhaps Stevenson argues that the concept of objective goodness is incoherent or doesn't apply in the way the objection suggests.\n\nBut again, that's not directly reflected in the options.\n\nGiven the choices, I have to pick one, and based on my reasoning, I think D is the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
