                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about sampling plans for an online music streaming service. They want to survey customers who have joined in the past 12 months and they're concerned about getting a representative sample, especially considering that musical tastes vary by geographical region. There are four options provided, and I need to figure out which one would give the most representative sample.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a representative sample means. It should mirror the characteristics of the entire population as closely as possible. In this case, the population is all customers who have joined in the past 12 months, and one key characteristic is the geographical region since musical tastes vary by region.\n\nOption A suggests choosing all customers who joined in the last month. Hmm, but the question specifies customers who have joined in the past 12 months, so just taking the last month might not be representative, especially if there were any seasonal trends or promotions that affected sign-ups in that month. This seems too narrow and might not capture the variability across the entire 12-month period.\n\nOption B proposes making a list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months and then choosing a random sample from this list. Random sampling is a straightforward way to ensure that every customer has an equal chance of being selected, which generally helps in achieving a representative sample. However, since the problem mentions that musical tastes vary by geographical region, a simple random sample might not adequately represent all regions, especially if some regions have fewer customers.\n\nOptions C and D both involve stratified sampling based on the state where customers live. Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into subgroups (strata) based on a characteristic and then sampling from each stratum. This approach is useful when you want to ensure representation from all the strata, which in this case are the states.\n\nOption C suggests choosing 10 customers from each state. This is a form of stratified sampling with equal sample size per stratum. However, states have different population sizes and possibly different customer bases. Sampling the same number from each state might not be optimal if some states have many more customers than others.\n\nOption D suggests choosing 3% of the customers from each state. This is also a form of stratified sampling but with proportional allocation, where the sample size from each stratum is proportional to the stratum's size in the population. This approach ensures that each stratum is represented in the sample in proportion to its size in the population, which can lead to more precise estimates.\n\nGiven that the goal is to have a representative sample considering geographical variations, option D seems particularly suitable. By sampling a consistent percentage (3%) from each state, it ensures that each state's customer base is represented proportionally to its size, which could help account for regional variations in musical tastes.\n\nBut let's think about this again. If we use a percentage like 3%, we're effectively using proportional allocation in stratified sampling. This means that larger states with more customers will have more representatives in the sample, which makes sense because they have a larger customer base. However, if the variation in musical tastes is primarily driven by geographical regions (states in this case), then sampling a larger number from states with more customers ensures that we capture the diversity within those larger markets.\n\nOn the other hand, option C, which samples 10 customers from each state, might underrepresent larger states with many more customers. For example, if one state has 10 times more customers than another, sampling only 10 from each would mean that the smaller state has disproportionate influence in the sample, which might not accurately reflect the overall customer base.\n\nOption B, the simple random sample, could potentially capture the regional variations, but it doesn't guarantee representation from all regions, especially if the sample size isn't large enough or if some regions have very few customers.\n\nTherefore, between the given options, option D seems to be the most appropriate for ensuring a representative sample that accounts for geographical variations in musical tastes.\n\nWait a minute, but I should consider whether a 3% sample from each state is the optimal percentage. The choice of 3% might be arbitrary; perhaps a different percentage would be better. However, since the question provides this specific percentage, I assume that it's a reasonable one for the context.\n\nAlso, I should consider whether there are any potential issues with sampling 3% from each state. For instance, if some states have very small numbers of customers, even 3% might result in very few samples, which might not be sufficient to draw meaningful conclusions for those states. However, since the question is about the most representative sample of all customers, not specifically per state, this might not be a major issue.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the states are the best geographical stratification. Maybe there's a better way to stratify the data based on regions or other geographical divisions. But again, given the information provided, stratifying by state seems reasonable.\n\nLet me also consider the practical aspects. The company is planning to send out an email survey with a free month of service as an incentive upon completion. This incentive might improve response rates, which is good for getting a higher number of completed surveys.\n\nHowever, I should think about potential biases introduced by the sampling method. For example, if we're sampling from all customers who joined in the past 12 months, we might miss recent changes in the customer base if there are significant fluctuations in sign-ups.\n\nBut since the question specifies that they want to gather information about customers who have joined in the past 12 months, using this population seems appropriate.\n\nLet me also consider the representativeness in terms of other variables besides geography. For example, customer demographics, listening habits, or subscription types might vary. However, the problem specifically mentions geographical region as a variable of interest, so stratifying by state addresses that concern.\n\nIn summary, among the given options, I believe that option D\u2014stratifying by state and sampling 3% from each\u2014is the most representative approach because it ensures that each state's customer base is proportionally represented, thereby accounting for geographical variations in musical tastes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
