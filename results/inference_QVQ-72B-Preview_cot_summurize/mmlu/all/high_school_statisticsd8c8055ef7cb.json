                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nWe have Alfred and Ben, who don't know each other, and they're both considering asking Charlene to the school prom. There are some probabilities given, and I need to find the probability that Ben asks Charlene to the prom.\n\nFirst, let's list out the given probabilities:\n\n1. The probability that at least one of them will ask her is 0.72.\n\n2. The probability that they both ask her is 0.18.\n\n3. The probability that Alfred asks her is 0.6.\n\nAnd the question is, what is the probability that Ben asks Charlene to the prom?\n\nLet me define some events to make this clearer.\n\nLet A be the event that Alfred asks Charlene.\n\nLet B be the event that Ben asks Charlene.\n\nWe are given:\n\nP(A or B) = 0.72, which is the probability that at least one of them asks her.\n\nP(A and B) = 0.18, which is the probability that both ask her.\n\nP(A) = 0.6, which is the probability that Alfred asks her.\n\nAnd we need to find P(B), the probability that Ben asks her.\n\nI recall that for any two events, the probability of either event occurring is given by:\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)\n\nSo, plugging in the values I have:\n\n0.72 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.18\n\nLet me solve for P(B):\n\nFirst, add 0.18 to both sides:\n\n0.72 + 0.18 = 0.6 + P(B)\n\n0.90 = 0.6 + P(B)\n\nThen, subtract 0.6 from both sides:\n\n0.90 - 0.6 = P(B)\n\n0.3 = P(B)\n\nSo, the probability that Ben asks Charlene to the prom is 0.3.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.78\n\nB. 0.3\n\nC. 0.24\n\nD. 0.48\n\nIt seems like option B is 0.3, which matches my answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWe have P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)\n\nPlugging in:\n\n0.72 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.18\n\nSimplify:\n\n0.72 = 0.42 + P(B)\n\nSubtract 0.42 from both sides:\n\n0.72 - 0.42 = P(B)\n\n0.30 = P(B)\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using conditional probability or something else, but I think this is the straightforward way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the probabilities of neither asking her, but that might complicate things more than necessary.\n\nLet me think about the independence of events. Does it matter whether Alfred and Ben's decisions are independent or dependent?\n\nWell, the problem doesn't specify, but since they don't know each other, perhaps their decisions are independent. However, the formula I used doesn't assume independence; it works regardless of whether A and B are independent or not.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 0.3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
