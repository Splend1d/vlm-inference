The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. In Scenario 1, the main character is at the park and gets distracted by a barking dog. To make the dog more tranquil, they ask to pet it and then proceed to pet it. In Scenario 2, the main character's brother is in trouble for doing drugs, and they find him a rehab center. So, one scenario involves interacting with a dog, and the other involves helping a family member with a drug problem.\n\nLet me consider Scenario 1 first. The dog is barking, which might be disturbing to some people, but the main character's intention is to calm the dog down by petting it after asking permission. Petting a dog can be a friendly gesture, and asking before doing so shows consideration for the dog's owner or handler. From what I can see, this seems like a harmless and potentially helpful action. I don't think there's anything morally wrong with that, at least not according to general US moral standards.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2, the main character's brother is in trouble for doing drugs. The main character responds by finding a rehab center for him. Now, helping someone with a drug problem by directing them to professional help is generally considered a positive and responsible action. Rehab centers are there to assist people in overcoming addiction, and supporting a family member in this way is seen as caring and supportive behavior.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are not morally wrong. In fact, they appear to be morally acceptable or even praiseworthy. Therefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. In Scenario 1, petting a dog after asking permission is a benign action. It's common courtesy to ask before petting someone else's dog, as some dogs may not like being petted by strangers or may have health issues. By asking first, the main character is showing respect for the dog and its owner's wishes.\n\nIn Scenario 2, seeking help for a family member struggling with drugs is a sign of concern and a desire to see them get better. It's aligned with familial duty and social responsibility.\n\nI can't see any moral transgressions in either scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
