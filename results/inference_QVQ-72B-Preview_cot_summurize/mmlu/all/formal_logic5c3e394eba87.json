                    "text": "Let's tackle this logic problem. So, I have this sentence: \"Either England's not importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China promotes human rights if and only if South Africa doesn't supply diamonds.\" And I need to find which of the given formulas best symbolizes this sentence.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its components. There are two main parts connected by \"either...or...\". So, it's a disjunction of two conditional statements.\n\nLet's define the variables:\n\n- E: England imports beef.\n\n- F: France subsidizes agriculture.\n\n- C: China promotes human rights.\n\n- S: South Africa supplies diamonds.\n\nNow, the first part of the sentence is: \"England's not importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.\"\n\nI need to understand what \"necessary condition\" means in logical terms. A necessary condition for an event is one that must be true for the event to occur. In other words, if the condition is not met, then the event cannot happen.\n\nSo, if \"not importing beef by England\" is a necessary condition for \"France subsidizing agriculture,\" that means France can only subsidize agriculture if England is not importing beef. In logical terms, this translates to:\n\nIf France subsidizes agriculture, then England is not importing beef.\n\nWhich is F \u2283 ~E.\n\nSo, the first part is F \u2283 ~E.\n\nNow, the second part of the sentence is: \"China promotes human rights if and only if South Africa doesn't supply diamonds.\"\n\nThe \"if and only if\" indicates a biconditional relationship. So, China promotes human rights is true exactly when South Africa doesn't supply diamonds is true. In logical terms, this is C \u2261 ~S.\n\nSo, the entire sentence is: (F \u2283 ~E) \u2228 (C \u2261 ~S).\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. (F \u2283 ~E) \u2228 (C \u2261 ~S)\n\nB. (~E \u2283 F) \u2228 (C \u2283 ~S)\n\nC. ~(F \u2283 E) \u2228 (~S \u2283 C)\n\nD. (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (C \u2261 ~S)\n\nComparing the options with what I derived, option A matches exactly with my understanding of the sentence.\n\nBut I should double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming the first part: \"England's not importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture\" translates to F \u2283 ~E, which matches option A.\n\nSecond part: \"China promotes human rights if and only if South Africa doesn't supply diamonds\" translates to C \u2261 ~S, which also matches option A.\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's look at the other options and see why they might be incorrect.\n\nOption B: (~E \u2283 F) \u2228 (C \u2283 ~S)\n\nHere, ~E \u2283 F translates to \"if England is not importing beef, then France subsidizes agriculture.\" This is different from the first part of the original sentence, which said that not importing beef is a necessary condition for subsidizing agriculture, not a sufficient condition.\n\nSimilarly, C \u2283 ~S means \"if China promotes human rights, then South Africa doesn't supply diamonds,\" which is only the forward direction, not the biconditional.\n\nSo, option B doesn't match the original sentence.\n\nOption C: ~(F \u2283 E) \u2228 (~S \u2283 C)\n\nFirst part: ~(F \u2283 E). The negation of \"if F then E\" is \"F and not E,\" which is not directly related to the original sentence's first part.\n\nSecond part: ~S \u2283 C, which is \"if South Africa doesn't supply diamonds, then China promotes human rights,\" again, not the biconditional relationship specified in the original sentence.\n\nSo, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (C \u2261 ~S)\n\nFirst part: F \u2283 E, which is \"if France subsidizes agriculture, then England imports beef.\" This contradicts the original first part, which said that not importing beef is a necessary condition for subsidizing agriculture, which was F \u2283 ~E, not F \u2283 E.\n\nSecond part: C \u2261 ~S, which matches the original second part.\n\nSo, overall, option D doesn't fully capture the original sentence because the first part is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization of the original sentence is option A: (F \u2283 ~E) \u2228 (C \u2261 ~S).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
