                    "text": "So I need to find the slope of the line that passes through these two points: (5, 4) and (-2, 3). The options are A. 0.14, B. 0.2, C. 0.33, and D. 5. Hmm, I remember that the slope is like how steep the line is, right? But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.\n\nLet me think back to my math classes. Oh yeah, the slope formula is m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). Okay, that seems familiar. So, if I have two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), I can plug in the coordinates into this formula.\n\nSo, let's assign (5, 4) as (x1, y1) and (-2, 3) as (x2, y2). Wait, does it matter which one is which? I think the slope should be the same regardless of which point I choose as (x1, y1) or (x2, y2), as long as I keep the order consistent.\n\nLet me confirm that. If I switch the order, like (x2, y2) as (-2, 3) and (x1, y1) as (5, 4), the slope would be (3 - 4)/(-2 - 5), which is (-1)/(-7), which is 1/7, which is approximately 0.14. That's one of the options, A. 0.14.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure I'm doing it correctly. Let me try it the other way around. Let's say (x1, y1) is (-2, 3) and (x2, y2) is (5, 4). Then, m = (4 - 3)/(5 - (-2)) = (1)/(7) = 1/7, which is again approximately 0.14. So, it seems consistent.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Is there a possibility that the points are not on a straight line? Well, they are two points, so they always define a straight line. No, that's not an issue here.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the line is vertical or horizontal, but in this case, since both coordinates are different, it's neither purely vertical nor horizontal.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the definition of slope as rise over run. The rise is the change in y, which is 4 - 3 = 1, and the run is the change in x, which is 5 - (-2) = 7. So, rise over run is 1/7, which is approximately 0.14.\n\nThat matches option A. 0.14. But let me just double-check if there's any trick here that I'm missing.\n\nIs there a possibility that the slope is negative? Looking at the points, (5,4) and (-2,3). So, as x decreases from 5 to -2, y increases from 4 to 3. Wait, no, y decreases from 4 to 3 as x decreases from 5 to -2. So, it's actually a downward slope, which should be negative.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't align with what I calculated earlier. Both methods gave me a positive slope of 0.14, but actually, if y decreases as x increases, the slope should be negative.\n\nLet me re-examine my calculations. Starting again:\n\nGiven two points: (5,4) and (-2,3).\n\nUsing the slope formula: m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1).\n\nLet's choose (x1, y1) as (5,4) and (x2, y2) as (-2,3).\n\nThen, m = (3 - 4)/(-2 - 5) = (-1)/(-7) = 1/7 \u2248 0.14.\n\nAlternatively, if I choose (x1, y1) as (-2,3) and (x2, y2) as (5,4), then m = (4 - 3)/(5 - (-2)) = 1/7 \u2248 0.14.\n\nBut according to the direction of the line, since y decreases as x decreases, shouldn't the slope be negative?\n\nWait, maybe I have it confused. Let's think about it again.\n\nIf x increases from -2 to 5, and y increases from 3 to 4, then the slope should be positive. Because as x increases, y increases, indicating a positive correlation.\n\nSo, m = (4 - 3)/(5 - (-2)) = 1/7 \u2248 0.14.\n\nAlternatively, m = (3 - 4)/(-2 - 5) = (-1)/(-7) = 1/7 \u2248 0.14.\n\nBoth ways, the slope is positive 0.14.\n\nBut looking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.14\n\nB. 0.2\n\nC. 0.33\n\nD. 5\n\nOption A seems correct, but let's consider if there might be a different interpretation.\n\nPerhaps the question wants the slope in fraction form, but no, all options are decimals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the subtraction.\n\nLet me check the difference in y's and x's again.\n\nDifference in y: 4 - 3 = 1\n\nDifference in x: 5 - (-2) = 7\n\nSo, slope m = 1/7 \u2248 0.142857..., which rounds to 0.14.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the points in reverse order:\n\nDifference in y: 3 - 4 = -1\n\nDifference in x: -2 - 5 = -7\n\nSo, slope m = (-1)/(-7) = 1/7 \u2248 0.142857..., same as before.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. 0.14.\n\nBut to ensure there's no mistake, let me plot these points mentally.\n\nPoint (5,4): that's at x=5, y=4.\n\nPoint (-2,3): that's at x=-2, y=3.\n\nConnecting these, as x decreases from 5 to -2, y decreases from 4 to 3, but wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no: from x=5 to x=-2, that's a decrease in x, while y goes from 4 to 3, which is a decrease in y as well.\n\nBut actually, plotting it, moving leftward from (5,4) to (-2,3), both x and y are decreasing, so the slope should be positive.\n\nYes, that aligns with m = 1/7 \u2248 0.14.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the general formula, m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1), and plug in correctly, it should be consistent.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the slope is approximately 0.14, which corresponds to option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 0.14} \\]"
