Tolerant complaisant citizens.\" Hmm, interesting. I need to think about what makes a barrier to cultural diffusion.\n\nFirst off, cultural diffusion is when ideas, practices, or material goods spread from one culture to another, right? So, barriers to this diffusion would be things that hinder or slow down this spreading process.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Language. I know that language can be a big barrier. If two cultures speak different languages, it can be hard for them to communicate and share ideas. So, language differences can definitely hinder cultural diffusion. For example, if I don't speak Spanish and someone else doesn't speak English, we might have trouble understanding each other and sharing our cultural practices.\n\nOption B: Religion. Religion can also be a barrier. People's religious beliefs can influence how open they are to adopting new ideas or practices from other cultures. Sometimes, religious doctrines might discourage borrowing from other cultures, especially if those cultures have different religious practices. So, religion can act as a barrier to cultural diffusion.\n\nOption C: Oceans. Physical geography can also be a barrier. Oceans and seas can make it difficult for people to travel and interact with each other, which can limit the spread of cultural traits. Historically, crossing oceans was a major challenge, and it wasn't until the development of better navigation techniques and ships that ocean barriers started to become less of an obstacle.\n\nNow, Option D: Tolerant complaisant citizens. Hmm, what does this mean? \"Tolerant\" means willing to accept different opinions and behaviors without criticizing them, even if you do not agree with them. \"Complaisant\" is a bit of a fancier word; it means pleasing or agreeable, often used to describe someone who is easy to deal with and accommodating.\n\nSo, if citizens are tolerant and complaisant, that suggests they are open-minded and easy to get along with. They would likely be receptive to new ideas and cultural traits from other places. This sounds like it would facilitate cultural diffusion rather than hinder it.\n\nWait a minute, but is there any way that tolerant and complaisant citizens could be a barrier to cultural diffusion? Maybe if they're too complacent and not interested in change, but the word \"complaisant\" seems more about being agreeable and accommodating, not necessarily resistant to change.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Barriers to cultural diffusion are things that prevent or slow down the spread of cultural traits. Language differences, religious differences, and physical barriers like oceans all fit into that category. But tolerant and complaisant citizens seem to be the opposite of a barrier; they would make it easier for cultural traits to spread because they are accepting and agreeable.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, Option D: Tolerant complaisant citizens would NOT be considered a barrier to diffusion of a cultural trait.\n\nJust to make sure, let me see if there's any other way to interpret this. Maybe in some contexts, if people are too tolerant and complaisant, they might not actively resist harmful cultural traits, but that's more about the consequences of diffusion, not about hindering the diffusion process itself.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking about barriers to diffusion, meaning things that prevent or slow down the spread, not about the impacts of the spread itself. So, in that sense, tolerant and complaisant citizens would actually promote the spread of cultural traits, not hinder it.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Tolerant complaisant citizens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
