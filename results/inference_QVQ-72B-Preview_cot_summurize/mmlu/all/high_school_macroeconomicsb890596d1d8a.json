                    "text": "Okay, so I have this question about how consumption and saving change when disposable income increases by a certain amount, $X. The options are:\n\nA. Consumption increases by more than $X.\n\nB. Saving increases by less than $X.\n\nC. Saving increases by exactly $X.\n\nD. Saving remains constant.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which one is correct. I remember that disposable income is the income people have after taxes, and they can either consume it or save it. So, if disposable income increases, people can choose to consume more, save more, or a combination of both.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the fraction of an additional unit of income that is spent on consumption, and the marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the fraction saved. MPC plus MPS equals one, right? Because every dollar either goes to consumption or saving.\n\nSo, if disposable income increases by $X, the change in consumption would be MPC times X, and the change in saving would be MPS times X.\n\nGiven that MPC + MPS = 1, if MPC is less than 1 (which it usually is, unless there's some unusual situation), then MPC*X would be less than X, and MPS*X would also be less than X.\n\nWait a minute, but option A says consumption increases by more than $X. But if MPC is less than 1, then MPC*X should be less than X, not more. So, option A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B says saving increases by less than $X. Well, MPS*X would be less than X, since MPS is less than 1. So, that seems correct.\n\nOption C says saving increases by exactly $X. But MPS*X is less than X, not equal to X, so this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption D says saving remains constant. That can't be, because if income increases, saving should increase unless MPS is zero, which isn't usually the case.\n\nSo, based on this, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. Suppose disposable income increases by $100. If MPC is, say, 0.8, then consumption increases by $80, and saving increases by $20. So, saving increased by less than $100, which aligns with option B.\n\nAlternatively, if MPC is higher, say 0.9, consumption increases by $90, and saving by $10\u2014still less than $100.\n\nUnless MPS is equal to 1, which would mean all the additional income is saved, but that's not typical. Usually, MPS is less than 1.\n\nWait, but in standard macroeconomic models, MPS is less than 1, and MPC is greater than MPS, but both are less than 1.\n\nSo, in that case, saving increases by less than the increase in disposable income.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer: saving increases by less than $X.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the Keynesian consumption function: C = c0 + c1*Yd, where C is consumption, c0 is autonomous consumption, c1 is the marginal propensity to consume, and Yd is disposable income.\n\nIf Yd increases by X, then C increases by c1*X, and saving S = Yd - C, so S increases by X - c1*X = (1 - c1)*X, which is MPS*X.\n\nSince MPS is less than 1, (1 - c1)*X < X, which confirms that saving increases by less than X.\n\nTherefore, option B is correct.\n\nI think I've got it right. If I'm missing something, perhaps there's a special case where MPS equals 1, but that would imply that all additional income is saved, and consumption doesn't increase at all. That doesn't align with the options given, so I don't think that's relevant here.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with my choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
