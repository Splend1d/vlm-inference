                    "text": "So I have this genetics question here about blood types. It says that a child with type AB blood inherits an IA allele from one parent and an IB allele from the other. So, the child has both the IA and IB alleles, and as a result, both A and B glycoproteins are present on the surface of their red blood cells. The question is asking what this pattern of expression is called, and the options are codominance, epistasis, polygenic, or linkage.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what each of these terms means in the context of genetics.\n\nStarting with codominance: I remember that codominance is when both alleles of a gene are fully expressed in the heterozygous state. So, if someone has two different alleles, both are expressed equally, and their effects are seen together. In the case of blood types, if someone has both IA and IB alleles, and both A and B antigens are present on their red blood cells, that sounds a lot like codominance.\n\nNext, epistasis. Epistasis is when one gene masks the expression of another gene. So, for example, if gene A affects the phenotype of gene B. In the context of blood types, does having one allele mask the expression of another? Doesn't seem like it, because in type AB blood, both A and B antigens are expressed. So, maybe epistasis isn't the right answer here.\n\nPolygenic inheritance refers to traits that are influenced by multiple genes. For example, skin color or height can be polygenic because many different genes contribute to these traits. In the case of ABO blood groups, it's determined by a single gene with multiple alleles (IA, IB, and i). So, it's not polygenic; it's a single-gene trait with multiple alleles.\n\nLinkage is when two or more genes are located close together on the same chromosome and tend to be inherited together. This is different from independent assortment, where genes on different chromosomes are inherited independently. In the context of blood types, unless there's a specific linkage between the ABO locus and another gene, which I don't think is the case here, linkage isn't directly relevant to the scenario described.\n\nSo, going back to the question, it seems like codominance is the most fitting answer. Because both alleles, IA and IB, are being expressed simultaneously in the phenotype, meaning both A and B antigens are present on the red blood cells.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it again. In type AB blood, the individual has both A and B antigens, which suggests that both alleles are being expressed. This is different from dominance, where one allele would mask the other. For example, in type A blood, only A antigens are present, and in type B, only B antigens. Type O has neither A nor B antigens. So, in type AB, both are expressed, which aligns with codominance.\n\nI should also consider if there's any possibility of incomplete dominance or other genetic interactions, but in the ABO blood group system, codominance is the standard explanation for type AB blood.\n\nLet me check a quick reference to confirm. Oh, wait, I'm supposed to be thinking through this without external resources. Okay, trusting my understanding.\n\nSo, to sum it up, in the context of the ABO blood group system, where both IA and IB alleles are expressed in the heterozygous state, leading to the presence of both A and B antigens on red blood cells, this pattern of expression is best described as codominance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. codominance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
