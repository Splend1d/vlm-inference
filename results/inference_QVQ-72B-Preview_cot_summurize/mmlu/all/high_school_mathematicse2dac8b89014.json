                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this list of numbers: -36, -29, -22, and it goes up to 41, 48. The question is asking how many numbers are in this list. The options are 12, 10, 13, or 11. Hmm, I need to figure this out carefully.\n\nFirst, I notice that the sequence is increasing by 7 each time. So, from -36 to -29 is an increase of 7, then to -22 is another 7, and so on, up to 48. So, it's an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 7.\n\nTo find out how many terms are in this sequence, I should probably find the number of steps I need to take from the first term to the last term, each step being 7 units.\n\nLet me think about the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. I think it's:\n\nNumber of terms = (last term - first term)/common difference + 1\n\nYes, that sounds familiar. So, in this case, the last term is 48, the first term is -36, and the common difference is 7.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nNumber of terms = (48 - (-36)) / 7 + 1\n\nFirst, subtract -36 from 48:\n\n48 - (-36) = 48 + 36 = 84\n\nThen divide by 7:\n\n84 / 7 = 12\n\nAnd finally add 1:\n\n12 + 1 = 13\n\nSo, according to this, there are 13 numbers in the list. That would be option C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAnother approach: I can list out the sequence and count the numbers.\n\nStarting at -36, then -29, -22, -15, -8, 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 48.\n\nLet me count them:\n\n-36 (1), -29 (2), -22 (3), -15 (4), -8 (5), 1 (6), 8 (7), 15 (8), 22 (9), 29 (10), 36 (11), 43 (12), 48 (13).\n\nYep, that's 13 numbers. So, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the sequence as starting at -36 and adding 7 each time until I reach 48.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Maybe if the sequence includes zero or not, but in this case, it does include zero, and it's already listed as 1 in my count.\n\nWait, another thought: since it's an arithmetic sequence, the number of terms is always one more than the number of steps needed to get from the first to the last term.\n\nSo, the number of steps is (last term - first term)/common difference.\n\nIn this case, that's (48 - (-36))/7 = 84/7 = 12 steps.\n\nTherefore, the number of terms is 12 + 1 = 13.\n\nAgain, that points to option C.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any pattern or trick here that might make the answer different.\n\nIs the sequence inclusive? Well, yes, it starts at -36 and ends at 48, and all terms in between are included, so that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nMaybe I should check the differences again to make sure they're consistent.\n\nFrom -36 to -29: +7\n\n-29 to -22: +7\n\n-22 to -15: +7\n\n-15 to -8: +7\n\n-8 to 1: +9 wait, that's not right.\n\nWait a minute, from -8 to 1 is +9, but the common difference should be +7. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nLet me list the sequence again carefully:\n\nStarting at -36, adding 7 each time:\n\n-36, -29, -22, -15, -8, 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 48.\n\nWait, from -8 to 1 is +9, but that should be +7. Hmm, maybe the sequence is not consistently increasing by 7.\n\nWait, no: -8 +7 should be -1, but in the sequence, it's 1. Wait, that's strange.\n\nWait, let's check the sequence again. Maybe I miswrote it.\n\nWait, the sequence given is: -36, -29, -22, ..., 41, 48.\n\nWait, but in my earlier count, I had up to 48, but the sequence includes 41 and 48.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the sequence provided.\n\nWait, let's see: -36, -29, -22, -15, -8, 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 48.\n\nBut according to this, from -8 to 1 is +9, which breaks the common difference of 7.\n\nWait, perhaps the sequence is not increasing by exactly 7 each time, or maybe there's a typo.\n\nWait, let's check the differences:\n\n-29 - (-36) = 7\n\n-22 - (-29) = 7\n\n-15 - (-22) = 7\n\n-8 - (-15) = 7\n\n1 - (-8) = 9\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. From -8 to 1 is +9, not +7.\n\nWait, perhaps the sequence is supposed to increase by 7 each time, but there's an error in the sequence as written.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is: -36, -29, -22, -15, -8, 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 48.\n\nBut as we see, from -8 to 1 is +9, not +7.\n\nWait, perhaps the sequence is: -36, -29, -22, -15, -8, -1, 6, 13, 20, 27, 34, 41, 48.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n-36\n\n-29 (+7)\n\n-22 (+7)\n\n-15 (+7)\n\n-8 (+7 should be -1, but it's 1)\n\nWait, perhaps the sequence has a mistake in it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the common difference is -7, but that doesn't make sense because it's increasing.\n\nWait, perhaps the sequence is: -36, -29, -22, -15, -8, -1, 6, 13, 20, 27, 34, 41, 48.\n\nIn this case, the differences are consistent:\n\n-29 - (-36) = 7\n\n-22 - (-29) = 7\n\n-15 - (-22) = 7\n\n-8 - (-15) = 7\n\n-1 - (-8) = 7\n\n6 - (-1) = 7\n\n13 - 6 = 7\n\n20 - 13 = 7\n\n27 - 20 = 7\n\n34 - 27 = 7\n\n41 - 34 = 7\n\n48 - 41 = 7\n\nNow, this is a consistent arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 7.\n\nSo, the sequence should be: -36, -29, -22, -15, -8, -1, 6, 13, 20, 27, 34, 41, 48.\n\nCounting these, there are 13 terms, which corresponds to option C.\n\nAlternatively, if the sequence was different, but based on the given sequence and the consistent difference, 13 seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 13, option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]"
