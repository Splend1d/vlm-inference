                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"1 F is theoretically equal to A. 1 ohm of resistance, B. ratio of 1 V to 1 C, C. ratio of 1 C to 1 V, D. none of these.\" I need to figure out what 1 farad (F) is equal to in terms of volts (V) and coulombs (C).\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a farad is. I know that the farad is the unit of capacitance in the International System of Units (SI). Capacitance is the ability of a component to store an electric charge. So, if I have a capacitor with a capacitance of 1 farad, it means that it can store 1 coulomb of charge when there's a potential difference of 1 volt across it.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. Actually, capacitance is defined as the ratio of the charge stored to the voltage applied. So, capacitance (C) = charge (Q)/voltage (V). Therefore, 1 farad = 1 coulomb per volt, or 1 F = 1 C/V.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1 ohm of resistance\n\nOhms are units of resistance, which is a different concept from capacitance. Resistance is about how much a device opposes the flow of electric current, while capacitance is about storing charge. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nB. ratio of 1 V to 1 C\n\nThis would be volts per coulomb, which is actually ohms, not farads. Wait, no, volts per coulomb is actually volts per ampere, since ampere is coulombs per second. But actually, volts per coulomb is just ohms, which is resistance, not capacitance.\n\nC. ratio of 1 C to 1 V\n\nThis is coulombs per volt, which matches the definition of capacitance, which is C/V, i.e., farads.\n\nD. none of these\n\nWell, if I'm correct, then it's not none of these.\n\nLet me double-check. If capacitance is charge divided by voltage, then yes, 1 farad is 1 coulomb per volt. So, option C seems to be correct.\n\nBut wait, option B says ratio of 1 V to 1 C, which is 1 V / 1 C = 1 V/C. Since 1 V = 1 J/C (joules per coulomb), then 1 V/C would be 1 J/C\u00b2, which doesn't make much sense in this context. Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me consider the units:\n\n- Resistance: ohms (\u03a9) = volts per ampere (V/A)\n\n- Capacitance: farads (F) = coulombs per volt (C/V)\n\nSo, option C clearly matches the definition of capacitance.\n\nOption B is volts per coulomb, which is actually ohms, not farads.\n\nOption A is 1 ohm of resistance, which is different from capacitance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. ratio of 1 C to 1 V.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be sure, let me consider if there's any other way to interpret the question.\n\nIs there any possibility of misinterpretation? The question says \"1 F is theoretically equal to...\" and lists the options. It seems straightforward. Farads are units of capacitance, and capacitance is charge divided by voltage, so C/V.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. ratio of 1 C to 1 V.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
