                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out the best defense for the handyman in a contract action brought by the neighbor who got injured when a section of the fence fell on him. The neighbor is claiming damages for personal injuries, and the question is about which defense is the strongest in this situation.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand what's going on. The woman hired a handyman to build a fence between her property and the neighbor's property for $10,000. The fence was built, and she paid the handyman. Then, two weeks later, the neighbor was mowing his lawn near the property line, and a section of the fence fell on him, causing serious injuries. It turns out that the handyman didn't properly reinforce the fence, which led to the accident.\n\nNow, the neighbor is suing the handyman in a contract action for his personal injuries. I need to find out which of the given options is the handyman's best defense in this contract action.\n\nOption A says that damages for personal injuries cannot be recovered in a contract action.\n\nOption B says that damages for personal injuries to the neighbor were not within the contemplation of the woman and the handyman at the time they entered into their agreement.\n\nOption C says that the neighbor is only an incidental beneficiary of the agreement between the woman and the handyman.\n\nOption D says that the neighbor has no standing to assert such an action because he was not a party to the agreement between the woman and the handyman.\n\nAlright, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, in a contract action, typically, the parties involved are the ones who entered into the contract. Here, the contract was between the woman and the handyman to build a fence. The neighbor was not a party to this contract, so it's unusual for the neighbor to bring a contract action against the handyman.\n\nUsually, in contract law, only the parties to the contract can sue for breach of contract. So, the neighbor, who is not a party to the contract, might have a hard time bringing a contract action against the handyman.\n\nBut, there are exceptions to this rule. Sometimes, third parties who are intended beneficiaries of a contract can sue for breach of that contract.\n\nSo, in this case, was the neighbor an intended beneficiary of the contract between the woman and the handyman?\n\nWell, the fence was built between the woman's property and the neighbor's property. They had talked about the need for a fence, so perhaps the neighbor was an intended beneficiary.\n\nBut, the question is phrased as a contract action brought against the handyman by the neighbor, alleging only damages for personal injuries.\n\nNow, in contract law, damages are generally limited to those that were foreseeable at the time the contract was made and that flow directly from the breach of contract.\n\nIn this case, the breach is that the fence wasn't properly reinforced, and as a result, it fell on the neighbor, causing injuries.\n\nBut, personal injuries are typically not considered direct damages in a contract action. Usually, contract damages are for economic loss, such as the cost to fix or replace the defective workmanship.\n\nPersonal injuries are more akin to tort damages, which are typically recovered in a negligence action, not a contract action.\n\nSo, perhaps the handyman can argue that personal injury damages are not recoverable in a contract action, which is option A.\n\nBut, let's look at option B: damages for personal injuries to the neighbor were not within the contemplation of the woman and the handyman at the time they entered into their agreement.\n\nThis seems related to the concept of foreseeable damages in contract law. Damages that are too remote or not foreseeable at the time of contract formation may not be recoverable.\n\nSo, when the woman and the handyman agreed to build the fence, did they contemplate that a poorly built fence could fall on the neighbor and cause personal injuries?\n\nProbably not. Building a fence is generally for property division or privacy, not for ensuring the safety of the neighbor in the event of the fence falling.\n\nSo, the personal injuries might not have been within their contemplation, making these damages too remote to be recoverable in a contract action.\n\nThat seems like a strong defense.\n\nOption C says the neighbor is only an incidental beneficiary of the agreement between the woman and the handyman.\n\nIn contract law, there's a distinction between intended beneficiaries and incidental beneficiaries.\n\nIntended beneficiaries have the right to sue for breach of contract, while incidental beneficiaries do not.\n\nSo, if the neighbor is only an incidental beneficiary, he wouldn't have the right to sue in contract.\n\nBut, as I thought earlier, since the fence was built between the two properties, and there was discussion about the need for a fence, perhaps the neighbor was an intended beneficiary.\n\nHowever, even if he was an intended beneficiary, bringing a contract action for personal injuries might still be problematic because personal injuries are not typically considered economic damages in a contract context.\n\nOption D says the neighbor has no standing to assert such an action because he was not a party to the agreement.\n\nThis is similar to option C but takes a more direct approach.\n\nIn general, only parties to a contract can sue for its breach.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned earlier, intended beneficiaries can sometimes sue.\n\nSo, if the neighbor is an intended beneficiary, he might have standing to sue.\n\nBut, again, the nature of the damages\u2014personal injuries\u2014might not be recoverable in a contract action.\n\nNow, considering all this, I need to choose the best defense for the handyman.\n\nOption A argues that personal injury damages aren't recoverable in contract actions.\n\nOption B argues that such damages weren't contemplated at the time of the contract.\n\nOption C argues that the neighbor is only an incidental beneficiary.\n\nOption D argues that the neighbor has no standing because he's not a party to the contract.\n\nI think option B is the strongest defense here.\n\nHere's why:\n\nIn contract law, damages must be foreseeable and must flow naturally from the breach.\n\nPersonal injuries are not typically considered direct damages in a contract action.\n\nMoreover, it's unlikely that when the woman and the handyman agreed to build the fence, they contemplated that a poorly built fence could fall on the neighbor and cause personal injuries.\n\nTherefore, these damages would be too remote and not within the contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting.\n\nOption A is also strong, but option B gets more specific by referring to the contemplation of the parties, which is a key factor in determining the scope of damages in contract law.\n\nOption C and D rely on the neighbor's status as a beneficiary, which might or might not be the case, and even if he is an intended beneficiary, the nature of the damages might still bar his claim in contract.\n\nTherefore, I believe option B is the best defense for the handyman in this scenario.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
