                    "text": "So Gwen has this number pattern: 1, 5, 9, 13. And I need to figure out what the next two terms are. The options are A. 15, 17; B. 15, 19; C. 17, 19; D. 17, 21.\n\nFirst, I need to see if there's a pattern or a rule that's being followed here. Let me look at the differences between each pair of numbers:\n\n- 5 - 1 = 4\n\n- 9 - 5 = 4\n\n- 13 - 9 = 4\n\nOh, okay, so each number is 4 more than the previous one. So it's an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 4.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then the next term after 13 should be 13 + 4, which is 17. And the one after that should be 17 + 4, which is 21.\n\nLooking at the options, D. 17, 21 seems to fit this pattern.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another pattern going on that I'm not seeing yet.\n\nLet me see if there's any other pattern or rule that could apply here. For example, could it be a sequence based on multiples of a number, or something more complex?\n\nWell, 1 is not a multiple of 4, but 5 is 4 times 1 plus 1, wait no, that's not right. 4 times 1 is 4, plus 1 is 5, which matches the second term. Then 4 times 2 is 8, plus 1 is 9, which matches the third term. 4 times 3 is 12, plus 1 is 13, matching the fourth term. So, the general term could be 4n + 1, where n starts from 0.\n\nLet's check:\n\n- For n=0: 4*0 + 1 = 1\n\n- n=1: 4*1 + 1 = 5\n\n- n=2: 4*2 + 1 = 9\n\n- n=3: 4*3 + 1 = 13\n\nYes, that fits. So the next two terms would be for n=4 and n=5:\n\n- n=4: 4*4 + 1 = 17\n\n- n=5: 4*5 + 1 = 21\n\nAgain, this points to option D. 17, 21.\n\nBut let's see if there's any other possible interpretation. Maybe it's not just adding 4 each time, but something else is happening.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a sequence where each term is being multiplied by a certain number and then adding or subtracting something, but that seems unlikely given the straightforward increase by 4 each time.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to see if the sequence is quadratic, but given the first differences are constant (each term increases by 4), it's more likely an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a pattern based on positions, like odd positions are one number and even positions are another, but in this short sequence, that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nWait a minute, let's consider the numbers: 1, 5, 9, 13. All these are numbers that end with '1' or '3' in their units place. But that doesn't seem to help determine the next terms.\n\nAlso, all these numbers are odd, but that's because they're increasing by 4 each time, and starting from an odd number.\n\nLet me also consider the sequence in terms of binary or other number systems, but that seems too complicated for this context.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the possibility that the pattern isn't strictly arithmetic, and there might be an alternating pattern or something similar, but again, with only four terms, it's hard to see.\n\nGiven the information available, the most reasonable assumption is that it's an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4, making the next two terms 17 and 21.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider option A: 15, 17. If 15 were the next term, that would make the sequence increase by 2 from 13 to 15, which doesn't match the previous pattern of increasing by 4 each time.\n\nOption B: 15, 19. Again, 15 doesn't fit the pattern of adding 4, but 19 does, as 15 + 4 = 19.\n\nOption C: 17, 19. Here, 17 fits the pattern (13 + 4), but 19 doesn't fit if we're continuing to add 4 (17 + 4 = 21, not 19).\n\nOption D: 17, 21. Both fit the pattern of adding 4 each time.\n\nTherefore, based on the pattern of adding 4 each time, the correct answer should be D. 17, 21.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, perhaps I should consider if there's any other pattern that could lead to a different conclusion.\n\nFor example, maybe the sequence is based on multiples of 4 plus 1, as I thought earlier, and perhaps there's a point where this rule changes, but given the information provided, there's no indication of that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is being generated by a different formula, but with only four terms, it's challenging to deduce anything more complex.\n\nIn conclusion, the most logical and straightforward answer is that the next two terms in Gwen's pattern are 17 and 21, which corresponds to option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
