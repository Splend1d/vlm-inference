                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here. Juan rolls a fair regular octahedral die, which is an 8-sided die marked with numbers 1 through 8. Then Amal rolls a fair six-sided die, which is just a regular dice with numbers 1 through 6. We need to find the probability that the product of the two rolls is a multiple of 3.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what it means for the product to be a multiple of 3. That means that when Juan and Amal roll their dice, the numbers they roll multiplied together should give a number that's divisible by 3.\n\nSo, for example, if Juan rolls a 3 and Amal rolls a 3, their product is 9, which is divisible by 3. Or if Juan rolls a 6 and Amal rolls a 2, their product is 12, which is also divisible by 3.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider all the possible outcomes where at least one of the rolls is a multiple of 3, because if either Juan or Amal rolls a multiple of 3, the product will be a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, but it's not exactly \"at least one,\" because it's possible that both rolls are multiples of 3, which would also make the product a multiple of 3. So, it's the cases where Juan rolls a multiple of 3, or Amal rolls a multiple of 3, or both.\n\nLet me think about the sample space first. Juan has 8 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Out of these, which numbers are multiples of 3? 3 and 6.\n\nAmal has 6 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Multiples of 3 here are 3 and 6.\n\nSo, the total number of possible outcomes is 8 (Juan's options) times 6 (Amal's options), which is 48.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes where the product is a multiple of 3.\n\nLet me consider the cases:\n\n1. Juan rolls a multiple of 3.\n\n2. Juan does not roll a multiple of 3, but Amal does.\n\n3. Both roll multiples of 3.\n\nWait, actually, since I'm dealing with \"or,\" I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to avoid double-counting.\n\nBut in this case, since the events are not overlapping (because if both roll multiples of 3, it's counted in both), I need to be careful.\n\nActually, the probability that the product is a multiple of 3 is equal to the probability that Juan rolls a multiple of 3 or Amal rolls a multiple of 3 or both.\n\nSo, it's easier to calculate the probability that neither Juan nor Amal rolls a multiple of 3 and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThat is, find the probability that Juan rolls a number not divisible by 3 and Amal rolls a number not divisible by 3, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's see.\n\nFirst, find the probability that Juan does not roll a multiple of 3.\n\nJuan's die has numbers 1 through 8. Multiples of 3 are 3 and 6. So, there are 2 multiples of 3 out of 8 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability that Juan does not roll a multiple of 3 is (8 - 2)/8 = 6/8 = 3/4.\n\nSimilarly, for Amal, the die has numbers 1 through 6. Multiples of 3 are 3 and 6, so 2 out of 6. Therefore, the probability that Amal does not roll a multiple of 3 is (6 - 2)/6 = 4/6 = 2/3.\n\nSince the rolls are independent, the probability that both do not roll a multiple of 3 is (3/4) * (2/3) = 6/12 = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one of them rolls a multiple of 3 is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.\n\nIs it correct to assume that if at least one of them rolls a multiple of 3, then the product is a multiple of 3? Yes, because if Juan rolls a multiple of 3, regardless of what Amal rolls, the product will be a multiple of 3. Similarly, if Amal rolls a multiple of 3 and Juan doesn't, the product is still a multiple of 3.\n\nAnd since the events are independent, multiplying their probabilities for the \"neither\" case should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of the total number of favorable outcomes.\n\nNumber of ways Juan rolls a multiple of 3: 2 (3 or 6) times 6 (Amal's possible rolls), which is 12.\n\nNumber of ways Amal rolls a multiple of 3 but Juan doesn't: 6 (Amal's multiples of 3) times 6 (Juan's non-multiples of 3), which is 36.\n\nBut wait, this includes the cases where both roll multiples of 3, which are already counted in the first 12.\n\nSo, total favorable outcomes are 12 (Juan rolls multiple of 3) plus 36 (Amal rolls multiple of 3 and Juan doesn't), which is 48.\n\nWait, but that would mean all possible outcomes are favorable, which can't be right.\n\nWait, no. If I add 12 and 36, I get 48, but that's the total number of possible outcomes. That can't be, because some outcomes are being double-counted.\n\nAh, yes, the cases where both roll multiples of 3 are being counted in both the 12 and the 36.\n\nSo, I need to use inclusion-exclusion properly.\n\nNumber of outcomes where Juan rolls a multiple of 3: 2 * 6 = 12.\n\nNumber of outcomes where Amal rolls a multiple of 3: 8 * 2 = 16.\n\nNumber of outcomes where both roll multiples of 3: 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nSo, total favorable outcomes = 12 + 16 - 4 = 24.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 24/48 = 1/2.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier result.\n\nSo, the answer should be 1/2.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. \\frac{1}{2}\n\nB. \\frac{1}{4}\n\nC. \\frac{1}{144}\n\nD. \\frac{1}{288}\n\nSo, option A is correct.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't a mistake here.\n\nWait, in the inclusion-exclusion approach, I have:\n\nP(product is multiple of 3) = P(Juan rolls multiple of 3) + P(Amal rolls multiple of 3) - P(both roll multiples of 3).\n\nJuan: 2/8 = 1/4.\n\nAmal: 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nBoth: (2/8)*(2/6) = (1/4)*(1/3) = 1/12.\n\nSo, P(product is multiple of 3) = 1/4 + 1/3 - 1/12 = 3/12 + 4/12 - 1/12 = 6/12 = 1/2.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, using the complementary probability approach:\n\nP(neither rolls a multiple of 3) = P(Juan doesn't roll multiple of 3) * P(Amal doesn't roll multiple of 3) = (6/8)*(4/6) = (3/4)*(2/3) = 6/12 = 1/2.\n\nThen, P(at least one rolls a multiple of 3) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nSo, both methods confirm the answer is 1/2.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
