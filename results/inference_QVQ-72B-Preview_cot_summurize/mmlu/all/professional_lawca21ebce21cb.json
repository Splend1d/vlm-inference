                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario about a shopper who slipped and fell in a grocery store and got injured. She's suing the store for damages, and during the trial, she testified that while she was sitting on the floor after falling, she heard the assistant manager say to an employee, \"I thought I told you to get that mess up!\" Now, the grocery store's lawyer is objecting to this statement being admitted as evidence, saying it's hearsay. I need to figure out whether the court will overrule or sustain this objection based on the options provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what hearsay is. Hearsay is generally defined as an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and it's not admissible unless an exception applies. So, the assistant manager's statement, \"I thought I told you to get that mess up!\" is an out-of-court statement, and it seems to be implying that there was a mess on the floor that should have been cleaned up, which could be relevant to the store's negligence.\n\nOption A says that the objection will be overruled because the assistant manager's statement was not hearsay\u2014it was offered to show that they were aware of a problem on the floor. Hmm, but if the statement is being used to prove that there was a mess on the floor, which is the truth of the matter asserted, then it seems like hearsay to me. So, I'm not sure about this option.\n\nOption B says the objection will be sustained because the assistant manager's statement was pure hearsay and she had to be available for cross-examination for the statement to be admissible. Well, yes, hearsay statements are generally inadmissible unless the declarant is available for cross-examination or unless an exception applies. But maybe there's an exception here.\n\nOption C says the objection will be sustained because the statement was irrelevant to whether or not the store was negligent and liable for the shopper's injuries. But that doesn't seem right. If there was a mess on the floor that caused the shopper to fall, and the assistant manager knew about it and told someone to clean it up, that seems pretty relevant to the store's knowledge of the hazard and their negligence in not cleaning it up.\n\nOption D says the objection will be overruled because the assistant manager's statement, made in the scope of her duties, was a vicarious admission of the party opponent, the grocery store. This sounds promising. The party opponent rule allows statements by the opposing party to be admitted as exceptions to the hearsay rule. Since the assistant manager is an agent of the grocery store, her statement made in the course of her employment could be considered an admission by the store.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure about the scope of her duties. If she was acting within the scope of her employment when she made the statement, then it could be considered an admission by the store. However, if she was acting outside the scope of her employment, maybe in a personal capacity, then it might not qualify.\n\nAlso, I recall that there are different rules for admissions by a party opponent. In civil cases, statements by an opposing party are generally admissible. But in this case, it's the store that's the opposing party, and the assistant manager is an agent of the store.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. The assistant manager is an agent of the store, and her statement seems to be related to her job duties, specifically overseeing the cleanliness of the store. So, it's likely that her statement was made within the scope of her employment.\n\nMoreover, her statement could be considered an admission by the store that they knew about the mess and perhaps failed to clean it up in a timely manner, which is relevant to the store's negligence.\n\nSo, if her statement is being offered to prove that the store knew or should have known about the hazard and failed to address it, then it would be an admission by a party opponent and thus admissible under the hearsay exception.\n\nTherefore, the objection should be overruled, and the statement should be admitted.\n\nWait a minute, but option A also suggests overruling the objection, but for a different reason. Option A says it's not hearsay because it's offered to show awareness of a problem, not to prove the truth of the matter asserted. But actually, I think it is being offered to prove the truth of the matter\u2014that there was a mess on the floor\u2014that's why it's hearsay.\n\nSo, perhaps option D is a better choice because it correctly identifies the hearsay exception based on party opponent admissions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the statement is being offered not for its truth, but to show the store's awareness or to show subsequent remedial measures or something like that. But I don't think that's the case here.\n\nI think the key here is that the statement is being offered to prove that there was a mess on the floor, which is relevant to the store's negligence. Since the assistant manager is an agent of the store, and the statement was made within the scope of her employment, it's an admission by the party opponent and thus admissible.\n\nSo, I believe the correct answer is option D: the objection will be overruled because the assistant manager's statement, made in the scope of her duties, was a vicarious admission of the party opponent, the grocery store.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
