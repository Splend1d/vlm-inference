                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a box sliding horizontally without friction, and then a constant force is applied in the direction of its motion. It travels 5 meters with this force applied, and after the force is removed, it has a speed of 2 m/s. I need to find the magnitude of the applied force, and there are multiple choices: 1 N, 2 N, 3 N, or 4 N.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The box is moving horizontally at 1 m/s initially, and there's no friction, so no forces are opposing its motion initially. Then, a constant force is applied in the direction of its motion for a distance of 5 meters. After that, the force is removed, and the box has a speed of 2 m/s.\n\nI think I should use the work-energy theorem here, which relates the work done by a net force to the change in kinetic energy of the object. The work done by the constant force should equal the change in kinetic energy of the box during the time the force is applied.\n\nLet's recall the work-energy theorem:\n\n\\[ W = \\Delta K E \\]\n\nwhere \\( W \\) is the work done by the net force, and \\( \\Delta K E \\) is the change in kinetic energy.\n\nSince the force is constant and applied over a distance of 5 meters in the direction of motion, the work done by this force is:\n\n\\[ W = F \\cdot d \\]\n\nwhere \\( F \\) is the magnitude of the force and \\( d \\) is the distance over which it's applied.\n\nThe change in kinetic energy is the final kinetic energy minus the initial kinetic energy.\n\nFirst, let's find the initial and final kinetic energies.\n\nInitial velocity (\\( v_i \\)) = 1 m/s\n\nFinal velocity (\\( v_f \\)) = 2 m/s\n\nMass (\\( m \\)) = 10 kg\n\nInitial kinetic energy (\\( KE_i \\)) = \\( \\frac{1}{2} m v_i^2 \\) = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times (1)^2 \\) = 5 J\n\nFinal kinetic energy (\\( KE_f \\)) = \\( \\frac{1}{2} m v_f^2 \\) = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times (2)^2 \\) = 20 J\n\nChange in kinetic energy (\\( \\Delta KE \\)) = \\( KE_f - KE_i \\) = 20 J - 5 J = 15 J\n\nSo, according to the work-energy theorem:\n\n\\[ W = \\Delta KE \\]\n\n\\[ F \\cdot d = 15 J \\]\n\n\\[ F \\times 5 m = 15 J \\]\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{15 J}{5 m} = 3 N \\]\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let's double-check if there's more to this problem.\n\nI notice that the force is applied for a distance of 5 meters, but during that time, the box is accelerating because a constant force is being applied, which means its velocity is increasing. After the force is removed, it continues at a constant speed of 2 m/s.\n\nMaybe I should consider the acceleration and the equations of motion to find the force.\n\nLet's recall Newton's second law:\n\n\\[ F = m a \\]\n\nwhere \\( a \\) is the acceleration.\n\nAlso, the equations of motion (kinematic equations) can be used since the motion is uniform acceleration.\n\nGiven initial velocity (\\( v_i \\)) = 1 m/s\n\nFinal velocity (\\( v_f \\)) = 2 m/s\n\nDistance (\\( d \\)) = 5 m\n\nWe can find the acceleration using the equation:\n\n\\[ v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2 a d \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ (2)^2 = (1)^2 + 2 a (5) \\]\n\n\\[ 4 = 1 + 10 a \\]\n\n\\[ 10 a = 3 \\]\n\n\\[ a = 0.3 m/s^2 \\]\n\nNow, using Newton's second law:\n\n\\[ F = m a = 10 kg \\times 0.3 m/s^2 = 3 N \\]\n\nThis matches the earlier result of 3 N.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to approach this, maybe using the concept of work and energy again but more carefully.\n\nThe work done by the force is equal to the change in kinetic energy over the distance where the force is applied.\n\nAlternatively, since the force is constant and parallel to the displacement, the work done is simply force times distance.\n\nSo, \\( W = F d = \\Delta KE \\)\n\nWe already have \\( \\Delta KE = 15 J \\) and \\( d = 5 m \\), so:\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{15 J}{5 m} = 3 N \\]\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. The problem mentions that the force is applied in the direction of its motion, and there's no friction, so no other forces are acting horizontally.\n\nWait, but the box is moving horizontally without friction, and then a constant force is applied in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 meters while the force is applied, and after that, it has a speed of 2 m/s.\n\nI should make sure that the 5 meters is the distance traveled while the force is applied, and not the total distance.\n\nAlso, I should confirm if the force is applied for a certain time or distance. The problem says the box travels 5 meters with the constant force applied, so it's distance-based, not time-based.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the work done by the force over the 5 meters, which equals the change in kinetic energy.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the power, but that might be unnecessary here.\n\nI think the approaches I've taken so far are valid, and both lead to the same answer of 3 N.\n\nLet me check the multiple-choice options again:\n\nA. 1 N\n\nB. 2 N\n\nC. 3 N\n\nD. 4 N\n\nOur calculation suggests that C. 3 N is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possible misstep.\n\nOne potential misstep could be assuming that the force is the only force acting on the box, and that there's no other force contributing to the change in kinetic energy. The problem states that there's no friction and the force is applied in the direction of motion, so I think it's safe to assume that the force is the only horizontal force acting on the box.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the force is applied constantly over the 5 meters, which it is, as stated.\n\nAlternatively, if the force were applied for a certain time, I'd need to consider the acceleration and find the distance traveled during that time, but the problem specifies that the force is applied over a distance of 5 meters.\n\nTherefore, I believe that the answer is indeed 3 N.\n\nTo summarize, using both the work-energy theorem and the equations of motion, I arrived at the same result, which gives me confidence in the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3\\ \\text{N}} \\]"
