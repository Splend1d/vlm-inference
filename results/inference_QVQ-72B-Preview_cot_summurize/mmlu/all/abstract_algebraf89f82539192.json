                    "text": "Okay, I have this question about vector spaces and bases. There are two statements, and I need to determine whether each is true or false. Let's tackle them one at a time.\n\nFirst statement: \"In a finite-dimensional vector space, every linearly independent set of vectors is contained in a basis.\"\n\nHmm, I need to recall what a basis is. A basis for a vector space is a linearly independent set that spans the entire space. So, every vector in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors.\n\nThe statement is saying that any linearly independent set can be expanded to form a basis. That sounds familiar. I think there's a theorem in linear algebra that says something like that.\n\nLet me think about it. If I have a linearly independent set, say S, in a finite-dimensional vector space V, then I can add more vectors to S, one by one, as long as they are not linear combinations of the vectors already in S, and eventually, I'll get a basis.\n\nWait, but the statement says \"contained in a basis,\" which might mean that there exists some basis that includes S. Is that always true?\n\nI think so. In fact, there's a theorem that says that any linearly independent set can be extended to a basis. Let me see if I can recall the exact statement.\n\nOh, I think it's called the Steinitz exchange lemma or something like that. It allows us to exchange linearly independent vectors with vectors from a spanning set to get a basis.\n\nSo, if I have a linearly independent set S and a spanning set T, I can exchange vectors from T with those in S to get a basis.\n\nBut in this case, since V is finite-dimensional, there must be a finite basis. So, starting with S, which is linearly independent, I can keep adding vectors that are not in the span of S until I have a set that spans V.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the first statement should be true.\n\nNow, the second statement: \"If B\u2081 and B\u2082 are bases for the same vector space, then |B\u2081| = |B\u2082|.\"\n\nThis is about the cardinality of bases in the same vector space. I know that a fundamental theorem in linear algebra says that all bases of a finite-dimensional vector space have the same number of elements. This number is called the dimension of the vector space.\n\nSo, if B\u2081 and B\u2082 are both bases for V, which is finite-dimensional, then they should have the same number of vectors. That is, |B\u2081| = |B\u2082|.\n\nWait, but the question doesn't specify that V is finite-dimensional. It only says \"in a finite-dimensional vector space,\" but the statements are about finite-dimensional spaces.\n\nOh, hold on. The first statement explicitly says \"in a finite-dimensional vector space,\" so it's about finite-dimensional spaces. But the second statement doesn't specify, but I think it's implied that V is finite-dimensional, given the context of the first statement.\n\nBut to be sure, I should consider if V is finite-dimensional or not.\n\nActually, the first statement starts with \"in a finite-dimensional vector space,\" so it's clear that V is finite-dimensional there. The second statement begins with \"if B\u2081 and B\u2082 are bases for the same vector space,\" which is presumably V, as defined in the first statement.\n\nTherefore, both statements are about a finite-dimensional vector space V.\n\nSo, in finite-dimensional vector spaces, all bases have the same number of elements. That's a standard result, and I'm pretty sure it's true.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider an example. Take R\u00b2, the Euclidean plane. A basis could be {(1,0), (0,1)}, which has two vectors. Another basis could be {(1,1), (1,-1)}, also two vectors. Similarly, in R\u00b3, any basis will have three vectors.\n\nOn the other hand, in infinite-dimensional spaces, like the space of all polynomials, bases can have different cardinalities, but since V is finite-dimensional here, the statement should hold.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct answer should be A. True, True.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about if there's any exception or special case that might make one of the statements false.\n\nFor the first statement, is there any linearly independent set that cannot be extended to a basis in a finite-dimensional vector space?\n\nI don't think so. The process of extending a linearly independent set to a basis is a standard procedure in linear algebra, and it's guaranteed to work in finite-dimensional spaces.\n\nFor the second statement, is there any finite-dimensional vector space where bases have different numbers of elements?\n\nNo, that's a fundamental theorem in linear algebra. The dimension of a finite-dimensional vector space is well-defined, meaning all bases have the same number of elements.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, and the answer is A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
