                    "text": "Let's see here. I'm trying to figure out how the city of Cobb should report its two trust funds for the library. There are trust fund A and trust fund B, and they have different rules about how their funds can be used. I need to match these with the reporting categories provided in the options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each type of fund is.\n\nA permanent fund is typically used to account for resources that are restricted to produce income, and the principal amount can't be spent. So, it's like the principal is preserved forever, and only the earnings can be used for specific purposes.\n\nA special revenue fund, on the other hand, is used to account for specific revenues that are restricted or Ear-marked for particular purposes, and both the principal and the interest can be spent according to the restrictions.\n\nNow, looking at trust fund A, it says that only the earnings can be expended. That sounds a lot like a permanent fund because the principal is being preserved, and only the income generated can be used.\n\nFor trust fund B, both the principal and the interest can be expended. That seems more like a special revenue fund, where the principal and the earnings can be spent for the benefit of the library.\n\nSo, based on this, it looks like trust fund A should be reported as a permanent fund, and trust fund B should be reported as a special revenue fund.\n\nLet me double-check that. In the options provided:\n\nA. Permanent Permanent\n\nB. Permanent Special revenue\n\nC. Special revenue Permanent\n\nD. Special revenue Special revenue\n\nSo, option B seems to match my initial thought: trust fund A is permanent, and trust fund B is special revenue.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe there's a different way to look at this.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the purpose of each fund. Both are for the benefit of the city's library, but trust fund A restricts the expenditure to earnings only, while trust fund B allows both principal and interest to be spent.\n\nThat still points towards trust fund A being a permanent fund since the principal can't be touched, and trust fund B being a special revenue fund because both principal and interest can be used.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether these funds are subject to any external restrictions or if they're governed by specific laws or donor restrictions.\n\nGiven that they are trust funds, it's likely that there are specific terms governing their use, which aligns with the idea of them being either permanent funds or special revenue funds based on their expenditure rules.\n\nI don't think it's necessary to consider other types of funds, like debt service funds or capital projects funds, because those are for different purposes.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way to interpret this. Maybe trust fund A could be considered a special revenue fund if the earnings are being used for specific purposes, but that doesn't seem right because in a special revenue fund, typically the principal can be spent as well, unless there are specific restrictions.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the key is whether the principal can be spent or not. In trust fund A, the principal can't be spent, only the earnings, which again points towards it being a permanent fund.\n\nSimilarly, in trust fund B, both principal and interest can be spent, which aligns with a special revenue fund where the resources are restricted or Ear-marked for specific purposes but can be spent.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I think the correct answer is option B: trust fund A is permanent, and trust fund B is special revenue.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's eliminate the other options:\n\nOption A: Permanent Permanent \u2013 this would mean both funds are permanent, but trust fund B allows both principal and interest to be spent, which doesn't fit with the definition of a permanent fund.\n\nOption C: Special revenue Permanent \u2013 this would mean trust fund A is special revenue and trust fund B is permanent. But trust fund A restricts expenditures to earnings only, which is more characteristic of a permanent fund, not a special revenue fund.\n\nOption D: Special revenue Special revenue \u2013 this would mean both funds are special revenue funds, but trust fund A doesn't allow the principal to be spent, which contradicts the typical characteristics of a special revenue fund.\n\nTherefore, option B is the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
