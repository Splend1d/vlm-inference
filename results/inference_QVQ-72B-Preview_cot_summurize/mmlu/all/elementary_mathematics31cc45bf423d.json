Hmm, I remember that to solve for x, I should get x by itself on one side of the equation. So, if I add 3 to both sides, that should do it.\n\nLet me try that. Starting with x - 3 = 6, I'll add 3 to both sides. So, x - 3 + 3 = 6 + 3. That simplifies to x = 9. Okay, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check.\n\nIf x = 9, then plugging back into the original equation: 9 - 3 should equal 6. Yeah, that checks out because 9 minus 3 is indeed 6. So, it looks like the answer is 9.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I could think about it in terms of inverse operations. Subtracting 3 is the operation applied to x, so to isolate x, I need to do the opposite, which is adding 3. That matches what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about balancing the equation. Whatever I do to one side, I must do to the other to keep it equal. So, adding 3 to both sides maintains the equality.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other method or if perhaps I'm missing something. The equation seems pretty straightforward, so I don't think there's a trick here. It's just a simple algebraic manipulation.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if x could be something else, but I don't think that's the case. The options given are A. 2, B. 3, C. 6, D. 9. So, based on my calculation, D. 9 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with that. Maybe I'll try to explain it to someone else to see if I can teach the concept. So, if I have x - 3 = 6, and I want to find x, I need to undo the subtraction to find the original value of x. Adding 3 back to 6 would give me 9, which must be x. And indeed, checking by plugging x back into the equation confirms that 9 - 3 equals 6.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the possible angles here, and I'm satisfied with the answer. X equals 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
