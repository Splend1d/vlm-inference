                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about moral wrongs, and it's asking which of two scenarios involves doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" So, I need to evaluate each scenario and determine whether they are morally wrong or not.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I scraped the paint off of my house before I repainted it.\"\n\nOkay, so someone is repainting their house and they scraped off the old paint first. Seems like a pretty straightforward home improvement task. I don't see anything inherently immoral about maintaining one's own property. It's their house, and they're just taking care of it by repainting. There doesn't seem to be any harm done to others in this scenario. So, according to ordinary moral standards, I don't think this is morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I would kill for that slice of pie, figuratively speaking.\"\n\nHere, someone is saying they would kill for a slice of pie, but they specify \"figuratively speaking.\" That means they're not actually going to kill someone for a slice of pie; they're just expressing how much they want the pie in an exaggerated way. It's a common figure of speech to emphasize desire without literally meaning you would commit a heinous act for it.\n\nIn this case, since it's clearly stated as figurative, it's not an actual intention to commit murder. It's just a way of saying the pie looks really good. So, again, no actual moral wrongdoing here.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios seem to be \"Not wrong\" from a moral standpoint.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is asking for the answer that indicates which scenario is wrong and which is not. So, if both are not wrong, then the answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nIn Scenario 1, scraping and repainting a house is a normal maintenance activity, and there's nothing unethical about it. Unless there's some context missing, like the paint containing hazardous materials or something, but the scenario doesn't mention that. So, I'll assume it's just a standard painting job.\n\nIn Scenario 2, using figurative language to express a strong desire for food is harmless and doesn't involve any actual harm or wrongdoings. So, again, not morally wrong.\n\nSo, my final answer is \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
