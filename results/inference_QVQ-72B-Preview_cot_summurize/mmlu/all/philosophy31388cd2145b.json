The options are:\n\nA. act as one pleases.\n\nB. act on any of one\u2019s passions.\n\nC. act on one\u2019s strongest passion.\n\nD. act on one\u2019s conscience.\n\nAnd the question is, in the strictest and most proper sense, to follow nature is to...\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Butler means by \"following nature.\" I think, in philosophical terms, \"nature\" often refers to human nature, which includes our instincts, passions, and reason. So, following nature would involve acting in accordance with these natural inclinations.\n\nOption A says \"act as one pleases.\" That sounds a bit like doing whatever we want, without any constraints. But is that really following nature in the strictest sense? Maybe not, because human nature also includes the ability to reason and make moral choices, not just act on impulse.\n\nOption B is \"act on any of one\u2019s passions.\" Passions can be strong emotions or desires. So, this would suggest that following nature means giving in to any of our passions, whether they're strong or not. But again, human nature includes more than just passions; it includes rationality and moral sense.\n\nOption C is \"act on one\u2019s strongest passion.\" This seems a bit different. It's not about acting on any passion, but specifically on the strongest one. So, perhaps Butler is suggesting that our strongest desires or emotions should guide our actions. But I wonder if this is the most accurate interpretation. What if our strongest passion conflicts with our moral obligations or rational judgments?\n\nOption D is \"act on one\u2019s conscience.\" Conscience is often associated with moral judgment and the internal sense of right and wrong. So, acting on one's conscience would mean doing what one believes is morally right. This seems like a more guided and reflective way of following nature, incorporating both our moral senses and our rational capabilities.\n\nNow, considering Butler's perspective, I recall that he was an English bishop and moral philosopher. He is known for his emphasis on conscience and the importance of moral sense in guiding human behavior. In his work \"Sermon on Human Nature,\" he discusses the idea that human nature is composed of different principles, including self-love, benevolence, and conscience.\n\nButler argued that conscience is a fundamental part of human nature and that it should guide our actions. He believed that conscience is a reliable guide because it is a reflection of God's moral law within us. Therefore, acting according to one's conscience is acting in accordance with nature and with divine will.\n\nGiven this background, it seems that Butler would advocate for acting on one's conscience as the proper way to follow nature. He didn't think that following nature meant simply giving in to every passion or desire, but rather aligning one's actions with moral principles as dictated by conscience.\n\nLet me think about this further. If I consider that human nature includes both passions and reason, and that conscience is the voice of reason and morality, then acting on conscience would indeed be following the highest aspect of our nature.\n\nMoreover, Butler was critical of the idea that self-interest or passion should be the sole guides for action. He saw conscience as a check against mere self-interest and as a way to promote the common good.\n\nSo, if I were to choose among these options, I would say that acting on one's conscience is the most accurate representation of following nature in the strictest and most proper sense, according to Butler.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider if there's any evidence that Butler might have supported one of the other options.\n\nFor instance, option C suggests acting on one's strongest passion. While it's true that passions can be powerful motivators, Butler didn't view them as infallible guides. In fact, he recognized that passions can sometimes lead us astray, especially if they conflict with our moral duties.\n\nIn his sermons, Butler discussed the importance of balancing different aspects of human nature, but he ultimately placed conscience above other inclinations.\n\nSimilarly, option B, acting on any of one's passions, seems too permissive. Butler was aware that humans have many passions, some of which might be virtuous and others viceful. He wouldn't have advocated acting on just any passion without considering moral implications.\n\nOption A, acting as one pleases, is even more broad and could encompass acting on any whim or desire, which doesn't align with Butler's emphasis on moral responsibility and the guiding role of conscience.\n\nTherefore, after considering all the options, I'm confident that option D, acting on one's conscience, is the correct choice. It best reflects Butler's view on following nature in the strictest and most proper sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
