                    "text": "So I'm reading this passage from John Locke's Second Treatise of Government, and I'm trying to understand his ideas about when a government loses its legitimacy. Locke is famous for his theories on natural rights and the social contract, so this passage is probably building on those ideas.\n\nFirst, he talks about the \"end and measure\" of power in the state of nature being the preservation of all mankind. Then, when people form a government, that power is supposed to be used to preserve the lives, liberties, and possessions of the members of society. He emphasizes that this power isn't absolute or arbitrary over people's lives and fortunes but is instead about making laws and enforcing them to preserve the whole society.\n\nHe also mentions that this power comes from a compact or agreement among the people, meaning their mutual consent is what gives the government its authority. So, it's based on the idea that the government exists to serve the people and protect their rights.\n\nNow, the question is asking when a government loses its legitimacy according to Locke. The options are:\n\nA. It is weak and can be overthrown\n\nB. When the people wish to change governors\n\nC. When it becomes corrupt\n\nD. It tries to exercise absolute power\n\nLooking back at the passage, Locke says that when the legislative branch (the part of the government that makes laws) transgresses the \"fundamental rule of society\" by trying to grasp absolute power over people's lives, liberties, and estates, or by putting that power into the hands of others for improper ends, they forfeit their power.\n\nSo, according to Locke, the government loses its legitimacy when it attempts to become an absolute power, going against the original purpose for which it was established\u2014to preserve people's rights.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. It is weak and can be overthrown: The passage doesn't mention weakness as a reason for losing legitimacy. In fact, Locke seems to focus on the government's actions and whether they exceed their authority, not on their strength or vulnerability to being overthrown.\n\nB. When the people wish to change governors: While popular opinion is important in Locke's philosophy, especially since government power comes from the people's consent, the passage specifically mentions that transgressing the fundamental rules is what leads to forfeiture of power. Simply wanting to change leaders might not necessarily indicate a loss of legitimacy, especially if the government is still acting within its proper bounds.\n\nC. When it becomes corrupt: Corruption is certainly a problem in government, but the passage doesn't directly address corruption. It focuses more on the government exceeding its authority by trying to gain absolute power over people's lives, liberties, and possessions.\n\nD. It tries to exercise absolute power: This seems to align closely with what Locke is describing. He says that when the legislative branch attempts to grasp absolute power or put it into the hands of others for ends contrary to the society's preservation, they forfeit their power.\n\nGiven this, option D seems to be the most accurate based on the passage provided. Locke is clear that the government's power is derived from the people's consent and is intended for the purpose of preserving their rights. When the government exceeds these bounds and seeks absolute power, it betrays the trust of the people and thus loses its legitimacy.\n\nJust to make sure, let's look back at the key sentence: \"Whensoever, therefore, the legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society; and either by ambition, fear, folly or corruption, endeavor to grasp themselves, or put into the hands of any other, an absolute power over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people; by this breach of trust they forfeit the power the people had put into their hands for quite contrary ends.\"\n\nThis directly suggests that it's the government's attempt to seize absolute power that leads to a loss of legitimacy, not its weakness, the people's desire for new leaders, or general corruption (though corruption is implied as one possible cause of the government's transgression).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. It tries to exercise absolute power.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
