                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Who defined jurisprudence as the knowledge of things divine and human, the science of right and wrong?\" And the options are A. Austin, B. Ulpian, C. Holland, D. Allen. Hmm, I need to figure out who came up with that definition.\n\nFirst off, I remember that jurisprudence is the study of law and legal principles, kind of like the philosophy of law. It deals with the basic questions about the nature of law, justice, and the structure of legal systems. So, this definition seems to be attributing a specific understanding of what jurisprudence is all about.\n\nNow, the definition mentions \"the knowledge of things divine and human, the science of right and wrong.\" That sounds a bit classical, maybe even ancient, in its phrasing. It makes me think of Roman law or classical philosophy, where there was a lot of emphasis on natural law, morality, and divine influence on legal principles.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Austin \u2013 That's John Austin, right? He's known for his command theory of law, which is a type of legal positivism. He defined law as the commands of the sovereign backed by sanctions. But I don't recall him using this particular definition of jurisprudence.\n\nB. Ulpian \u2013 Now, Ulpian was a prominent Roman jurist. He lived during the 3rd century AD and was a key figure in the development of Roman law. I think he had a significant influence on how law was understood in the Roman Empire. Maybe he defined jurisprudence in this way?\n\nC. Holland \u2013 Zo\u00eb Holland? Wait, no, maybe Sir William Holland? I'm not sure. There are a few people with the last name Holland who have contributed to legal theory, but I don't specifically remember any of them using this definition.\n\nD. Allen \u2013 That could be any number of people. There are many scholars with the last name Allen who have written about law and jurisprudence. Without more specific information, it's hard to pin it down to one particular Allen.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should approach this differently. Perhaps I should look up the definition itself to see who is credited with it. Let me recall: \"the knowledge of things divine and human, the science of right and wrong.\" That sounds familiar, like something from ancient Roman jurisprudence.\n\nI think I've heard this definition before, and I believe it's attributed to Ulpian. Let me verify that. If I recall correctly, Ulpian was a influential Roman lawyer and jurist who contributed significantly to the Corpus Juris Civilis, which is a fundamental work in the history of Western legal tradition.\n\nYes, I think that's the case. Ulpian is known for defining jurisprudence as \"the knowledge of things divine and human, the science of right and wrong.\" This definition reflects the Roman legal thought that law encompasses not only human laws but also natural law and divine law, which were considered to be higher forms of law.\n\nSo, based on that, I would say that the correct answer is B. Ulpian.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider if any of the other options might also be associated with this definition. Austin, as I mentioned earlier, is known for his command theory of law, which is quite different from this classical definition. Holland doesn't ring a bell in connection with this particular definition, and Allen is too vague a reference without more context.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is B. Ulpian.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
