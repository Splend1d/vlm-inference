                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: a car starts from rest and uniformly accelerates to a final speed of 20.0 m/s in 15.0 seconds. I need to find out how far it travels during this time. The options are 150 m, 300 m, 450 m, and 600 m.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall the equations of motion for uniformly accelerated straight-line motion. I know there are a few key equations:\n\n1. v = u + at\n\n2. s = ut + (1/2)at\u00b2\n\n3. v\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + 2as\n\nWhere:\n\n- v is the final velocity\n\n- u is the initial velocity\n\n- a is the acceleration\n\n- t is the time\n\n- s is the displacement (distance in this case, since it's moving in a straight line without changing direction)\n\nGiven that the car starts from rest, the initial velocity u is 0 m/s. The final velocity v is 20.0 m/s, and the time t is 15.0 s. I need to find the distance s.\n\nLooking at the equations, the second one seems the most straightforward to use for finding distance: s = ut + (1/2)at\u00b2.\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\ns = (0 m/s)(15.0 s) + (1/2)a(15.0 s)\u00b2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\ns = 0 + (0.5)a(225 s\u00b2)\n\ns = (0.5)(a)(225)\n\ns = 112.5 a\n\nSo, if I can find the acceleration a, I can find s by multiplying it by 112.5.\n\nTo find a, I can use the first equation of motion: v = u + at.\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n20.0 m/s = 0 m/s + a*(15.0 s)\n\nSo, a = 20.0 m/s / 15.0 s = approximately 1.333 m/s\u00b2\n\nNow, plugging this back into the equation for s:\n\ns = 112.5 * 1.333...\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n112.5 * 1.333 = 112.5 * 1 + 112.5 * 0.333\n\n112.5 * 1 = 112.5\n\n112.5 * 0.3 = 33.75\n\n112.5 * 0.033 = approximately 3.7125\n\nSo, total s \u2248 112.5 + 33.75 + 3.7125 = 149.9625 m \u2248 150 m\n\nLooking back at the options, A is 150 m, which seems close enough to my calculation.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another way to approach this, maybe using the average velocity.\n\nI recall that for uniformly accelerated motion, the average velocity over time is (u + v)/2.\n\nSo, average velocity = (0 m/s + 20.0 m/s)/2 = 10.0 m/s\n\nThen, distance s = average velocity * time = 10.0 m/s * 15.0 s = 150 m\n\nAgain, this matches my previous result of 150 m.\n\nLet me just double-check if there's any other method or if I'm missing something.\n\nAnother equation I could use is the third equation: v\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + 2as.\n\nPlugging in v = 20.0 m/s, u = 0 m/s:\n\n(20.0 m/s)\u00b2 = (0 m/s)\u00b2 + 2*a*s\n\n400 m\u00b2/s\u00b2 = 0 + 2a s\n\nSo, 2a s = 400 m\u00b2/s\u00b2\n\na s = 200 m\u00b2/s\u00b2\n\nBut I already found a \u2248 1.333 m/s\u00b2, so s \u2248 200 / 1.333 \u2248 150 m\n\nConsistency across multiple methods is reassuring. It looks like the correct answer is 150 m.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should consider the significance of the options provided. The options are 150 m, 300 m, 450 m, and 600 m. My calculation points to 150 m, but let's see if there's any possible misinterpretation.\n\nIs there any chance that the car is moving with constant acceleration throughout, and I need to consider if the acceleration is changing or if there are other factors? The problem states that the car uniformly accelerates, which means constant acceleration, so I think my calculations are valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the relationship between speed and time graphically. The area under a speed-time graph gives the distance traveled. Since the car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly to 20 m/s in 15 s, the graph would be a straight line starting at 0 m/s and ending at 20 m/s at t=15 s.\n\nThe area under this line is a triangle with base 15 s and height 20 m/s, so area = (1/2)*base*height = (1/2)*15*20 = 150 m\n\nAgain, this confirms the distance is 150 m.\n\nI think I've approached this problem from multiple angles and consistently arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 150 m, which corresponds to option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 150\\ \\text{m}} \\]"
