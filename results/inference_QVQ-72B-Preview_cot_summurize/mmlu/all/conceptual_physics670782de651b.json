Hmm, I need to figure this out. I remember that light colors can mix to produce different colors, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics.\n\nFirst, I know that light is made up of different wavelengths, and when these wavelengths combine, they can create new colors. This is called additive color mixing. For example, if you have red, green, and blue lights, mixing them in certain proportions can produce a wide range of colors, including white.\n\nIn particular, red, green, and blue (RGB) are considered the primary colors of light. When you mix red and green, you get yellow; red and blue should give me another color. Wait, what color do red and blue make when overlapped?\n\nLet me think about this. I recall that in the RGB color model, mixing red and blue light produces magenta. So, that would be option A. But let me double-check because I want to be sure.\n\nI remember that magenta is a purplish-pink color, and it's often used in printing as one of the primary colors in the CMYK color model, but that's beside the point here. In the context of light mixing, magenta is indeed the result of mixing red and blue light.\n\nLet me consider the other options to make sure. Option B is yellow, which is what you get when you mix red and green light. Option C is cyan, which is the color you get when you mix green and blue light. And option D is white, which is produced when all three primary colors\u2014red, green, and blue\u2014are mixed together in equal proportions.\n\nSo, given that, mixing red and blue light should indeed produce magenta. Therefore, the correct answer should be A. magenta.\n\nWait a minute, just to be thorough, I'll think about it another way. Maybe using the color wheel could help visualize this. In the color wheel, red, blue, and green are evenly spaced. Magenta is typically located between red and blue, which makes sense because it's their mixture.\n\nYellow is between red and green, and cyan is between green and blue. So, again, confirming that magenta is the color produced by mixing red and blue light.\n\nI think I've covered the bases here. Additive color mixing is a fascinating topic, and it's crucial for understanding how electronic displays and televisions work. But for now, I'm confident that the answer is A. magenta.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ magenta}} \\]"
