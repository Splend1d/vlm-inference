Therefore, there won't be rain.\"\n\nAnd I need to determine which of the options A, B, C, or D is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of this argument. It's a conditional statement, right? The form is: If P, then Q. Where P is \"the sky is blue\" and Q is \"there won't be rain.\"\n\nSo, the argument is:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n\n2. P.\n\nTherefore, Q.\n\nThis is a standard modus ponens argument, which is a form of valid deductive reasoning. Modus ponens says that if you have a conditional statement and you affirm the antecedent, you can validly conclude the consequent.\n\nLet me recall the definition of a categorical syllogism. A categorical syllogism is an argument consisting of exactly three categorical propositions: two premises and a conclusion. Each of these propositions consists of two categorical terms connected by a quantifier and the copula.\n\nLooking back at the argument, it doesn't seem to fit the form of a categorical syllogism because it's a conditional syllogism, not a categorical one. Categorical syllogisms deal with categories like \"all S are P,\" \"no S are P,\" etc., whereas this is about conditional relationships.\n\nOption A says it's a formally valid categorical syllogism. But since it's a conditional argument, I don't think that's accurate.\n\nOption B says it's a formally invalid disjunctive syllogism. A disjunctive syllogism is of the form: P or Q; not P; therefore Q. Or P or Q; not Q; therefore P. The argument here is not in that form, so I don't think this option is correct either.\n\nOption C says it's a formally valid conditional syllogism. That seems to fit because it's a conditional argument, and as I thought earlier, it's a modus ponens argument, which is valid.\n\nOption D says it's a formally invalid conditional syllogism. But since it's valid, this can't be right.\n\nWait, but I should double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. Let's consider the structure again.\n\nPremise 1: If the sky is blue (P), then there won't be rain (Q).\n\nPremise 2: The sky is blue today (P).\n\nConclusion: Therefore, there won't be rain (Q).\n\nThis is classic modus ponens, which is a valid form of inference. So, the argument is valid.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any fallacy here. Is there any possibility of invalidity?\n\nWell, one might think about the truth of the premises. For example, maybe the sky can be blue and it can rain at the same time in some places or under certain conditions. But that's about the truth of the premises, not the form of the argument. The argument form itself is valid.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether this is a standard conditional syllogism. Yes, it is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone could argue that it's a hypothetical syllogism, but that's not quite right because hypothetical syllogisms involve chaining conditionals, like if P then Q, and if Q then R, therefore if P then R. Which isn't the case here.\n\nSo, no, this is straightforward modus ponens.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C: It is a formally valid conditional syllogism.\n\nJust to make sure, let's look again at the options:\n\nA. It is a formally valid categorical syllogism \u2013 No, it's conditional.\n\nB. It is a formally invalid disjunctive syllogism \u2013 No, it's neither disjunctive nor invalid.\n\nC. It is a formally valid conditional syllogism \u2013 Yes.\n\nD. It is a formally invalid conditional syllogism \u2013 No, it's valid.\n\nSo, C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
