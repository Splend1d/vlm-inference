                    "text": "I have this problem here: I need to find the product of two polynomials, f(x) = 4x - 5 and g(x) = 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 2, in the polynomial ring Z\u2088[x]. The options are A. 2x\u00b2 + 5, B. 6x\u00b2 + 4x + 6, C. 0, D. x\u00b2 + 1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Z\u2088[x] means. Z\u2088 is the integers modulo 8, and Z\u2088[x] is the ring of polynomials with coefficients in Z\u2088. So, any coefficients I get in the product will be reduced modulo 8.\n\nAlright, to find the product of f(x) and g(x), I should multiply them as polynomials and then reduce the coefficients modulo 8.\n\nLet's write down f(x) and g(x):\n\nf(x) = 4x - 5\n\ng(x) = 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 2\n\nI need to multiply these two polynomials. First, I'll distribute each term of f(x) with each term of g(x):\n\nf(x) * g(x) = (4x - 5)(2x\u00b2 - 4x + 2)\n\n= 4x * 2x\u00b2 + 4x * (-4x) + 4x * 2 + (-5) * 2x\u00b2 + (-5) * (-4x) + (-5) * 2\n\nNow, let's compute each term:\n\n4x * 2x\u00b2 = 8x\u00b3\n\n4x * (-4x) = -16x\u00b2\n\n4x * 2 = 8x\n\n-5 * 2x\u00b2 = -10x\u00b2\n\n-5 * (-4x) = 20x\n\n-5 * 2 = -10\n\nSo, the product before reducing coefficients is:\n\n8x\u00b3 - 16x\u00b2 + 8x - 10x\u00b2 + 20x - 10\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n8x\u00b3 + (-16x\u00b2 - 10x\u00b2) + (8x + 20x) - 10\n\n= 8x\u00b3 - 26x\u00b2 + 28x - 10\n\nNow, I need to reduce the coefficients modulo 8.\n\nLet's compute each coefficient modulo 8:\n\n8 mod 8 = 0\n\n-26 mod 8: -26 divided by 8 is -3 with a remainder of -2, so -2 mod 8 is equivalent to 6 mod 8 (since -2 + 8 = 6)\n\n28 mod 8: 28 divided by 8 is 3 with a remainder of 4, so 4 mod 8\n\n-10 mod 8: -10 divided by 8 is -2 with a remainder of 6, so 6 mod 8\n\nWait, but in Z\u2088, negative numbers can be confusing. Let's double-check:\n\n-26 divided by 8: -3*8 = -24, remainder -2. So, -2 mod 8 is the same as 6 mod 8 because -2 + 8 = 6.\n\nSimilarly, -10 divided by 8: -2*8 = -16, remainder 6.\n\nSo, the coefficients become:\n\n8x\u00b3 \u2192 0x\u00b3\n\n-26x\u00b2 \u2192 6x\u00b2\n\n28x \u2192 4x\n\n-10 \u2192 6\n\nSo, the product in Z\u2088[x] is 6x\u00b2 + 4x + 6.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 2x\u00b2 + 5\n\nB. 6x\u00b2 + 4x + 6\n\nC. 0\n\nD. x\u00b2 + 1\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. 6x\u00b2 + 4x + 6.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the multiplication:\n\n(4x - 5)(2x\u00b2 - 4x + 2)\n\n= 4x * 2x\u00b2 = 8x\u00b3\n\n+ 4x * (-4x) = -16x\u00b2\n\n+ 4x * 2 = 8x\n\n+ (-5) * 2x\u00b2 = -10x\u00b2\n\n+ (-5) * (-4x) = 20x\n\n+ (-5) * 2 = -10\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n8x\u00b3 - 16x\u00b2 + 8x - 10x\u00b2 + 20x - 10\n\n= 8x\u00b3 - 26x\u00b2 + 28x - 10\n\nNow, reducing coefficients modulo 8:\n\n8 mod 8 = 0\n\n-26 mod 8:\n\n-26 + 32 = 6, so 6 mod 8\n\n28 mod 8:\n\n28 - 24 = 4, so 4 mod 8\n\n-10 mod 8:\n\n-10 + 16 = 6, so 6 mod 8\n\nTherefore, the product is 6x\u00b2 + 4x + 6, which matches option B.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 6x^{2} + 4x + 6} \\]"
