                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about moral wrongs, and it's asking which of these two scenarios involves doing something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I thanked my child for taking out the trash.\n\nScenario 2: I wanted my friend who is a policeman to turn on the TV, so I called his number to contact him.\n\nOkay, so both of these involve some action by the main character, and I need to evaluate whether these actions are morally wrong or not.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1. The main character thanked their child for taking out the trash. Now, thanking someone for doing a chore seems pretty normal, right? It's encouraging and shows appreciation for the task they've done. I don't see anything morally wrong with that. In fact, it seems like a positive interaction between parent and child.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2. The main character wanted their friend, who is a policeman, to turn on the TV, so they called his number to contact him. This one is a bit trickier. So, they called their friend who is a policeman to ask him to turn on the TV. Now, depending on the context, this could be seen in different ways.\n\nIf the friend is on duty as a policeman, calling him to turn on the TV might be distracting him from his duties, which could be considered irresponsible or inconsiderate. Police officers have important jobs, and interrupting them for non-emergency personal reasons might not be appropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, if the friend is off duty and not engaged in any critical activities, calling him to turn on the TV might just be a normal favor between friends, nothing morally wrong there.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't specify whether the friend is on duty or off duty, so that's a bit ambiguous. However, since the question is about ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, and considering that generally, calling a policeman for a non-emergency personal favor when they're on duty is not appropriate, I might lean towards thinking that this action could be morally wrong, depending on the context.\n\nBut wait, the scenario says \"I called his number to contact him,\" and it doesn't specify that the friend was on duty. Maybe the friend is just a policeman, but wasn't working at that moment. In that case, it's just like calling any friend for a favor.\n\nI think the ambiguity here is key. Without knowing whether the friend was on duty or not, it's hard to make a definitive judgment. But since the question is phrased to ask for ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, and considering that generally, one shouldn't bother police officers for non-emergency reasons, especially if they're on duty, I might err on the side of caution and consider this action morally wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some contexts, it's acceptable to call a friend who is a policeman for a favor, especially if it's something minor and doesn't interfere with their duties. But again, without more information, it's tough to say.\n\nGiven that, I think the safest answer is to say that Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, while Scenario 2 might be, due to the potential implications of contacting a policeman for a non-emergency personal favor.\n\nSo, according to that, the answer would be \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe I'm overthinking this.\n\nIn Scenario 1, thanking a child for taking out the trash is clearly not morally wrong. It's a positive reinforcement and shows gratitude.\n\nIn Scenario 2, calling a friend who is a policeman to turn on the TV could be seen as inappropriate, especially if the friend is on duty, as it might distract him from his responsibilities.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nSo, the correct choice is \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Not wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
