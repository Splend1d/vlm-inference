                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these options is a feature of McGregor's Theory X. I remember that Theory X and Theory Y are management theories developed by Douglas McGregor, and they represent different assumptions about human nature and motivation in the workplace.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Theory X is all about. From what I can remember, Theory X assumes that employees are inherently lazy, dislike work, and need to be closely supervised and controlled to perform their jobs effectively. So, it's a more authoritarian approach to management.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says, \"Workers enjoy responsibility.\" That sounds more like something you'd expect from Theory Y, which assumes that employees are self-motivated and take pride in their work. Theory X, on the other hand, assumes that workers prefer to avoid responsibility and need to be directed.\n\nOption B says, \"Workers view physical and mental effort as a natural part of work.\" Again, this seems more aligned with Theory Y, which posits that work can be a source of satisfaction and that employees are capable of self-direction and self-control.\n\nOption C says, \"Workers like to show initiative.\" This also aligns more with Theory Y, which assumes that employees are capable of being innovative and creative and can be trusted to make decisions without constant supervision.\n\nOption D says, \"Workers like to be directed.\" This seems to align with Theory X's assumption that workers prefer to be told what to do and do not like to take on responsibility or make decisions on their own.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option D is the correct answer for a feature of McGregor's Theory X.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check the main tenets of Theory X.\n\nTheory X assumptions include:\n\n1. The average human being has an inherent dislike of work and will avoid it if possible.\n\n2. Most people must be coerced, controlled, directed, or threatened with punishment to get them to put forth adequate effort toward the achievement of organizational objectives.\n\n3. The average human being prefers to be avoided from responsibility and has relatively little ambition.\n\n4. The capacity to exercise a relatively high degree of imagination, ingenuity, and creativity in the solution of organizational problems is widely, not narrowly, distributed in the population.\n\n5. Under the conditions of modern industrial life, the intellectual potentialities of the average human being are only partially utilized.\n\nLooking back at these assumptions, it's clear that Theory X assumes that workers do not like responsibility, do not enjoy work, and need to be directed. Therefore, option D, \"Workers like to be directed,\" is indeed a feature of Theory X.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other options could possibly be considered part of Theory X.\n\nOption A, \"Workers enjoy responsibility,\" contradicts Theory X's assumption that workers prefer to avoid responsibility.\n\nOption B, \"Workers view physical and mental effort as a natural part of work,\" is more in line with Theory Y's view that work can be satisfying and that employees are willing to exert themselves if they see a connection between their efforts and the achievement of organizational goals.\n\nOption C, \"Workers like to show initiative,\" is again more characteristic of Theory Y, which holds that employees are capable of being self-motivated and innovative when given the opportunity.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, I'm confident that option D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
