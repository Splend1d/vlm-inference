The question is asking what you would get if you ask for \"gai\" at a Thai restaurant. The options are shrimp, chicken, beef, or pork.\n\nFirst off, I know that Thai cuisine is famous for its balance of flavors and use of fresh ingredients. But specifically, what does \"gai\" mean in Thai culinary terms?\n\nI recall that \"gai\" is a Thai word for chicken. So, if I order \"gai\" at a Thai restaurant, I should be getting chicken. But just to make sure, let me think about some common Thai dishes that feature chicken.\n\nFor example, \"Pad Kra Pao Gai\" is a popular Thai stir-fry dish that includes chicken, basil, and chili. Similarly, \"Tom Kha Gai\" is a creamy coconut soup with chicken and lemongrass. In both of these dishes, \"gai\" refers to chicken.\n\nI also remember that in Thai restaurants, they often have a list of proteins to choose from, like shrimp, chicken, beef, or tofu, and then you can select a preparation style, like stir-fry or curry.\n\nGiven that, if I were to order just \"gai,\" without any specific preparation, I would probably get plain cooked chicken, maybe grilled or poached, depending on the restaurant's style.\n\nBut to answer the question directly, what you get if you ask for \"gai\" at a Thai restaurant is chicken. So, among the given options:\n\nA. shrimp\n\nB. chicken\n\nC. beef\n\nD. pork\n\nThe correct choice is B. chicken.\n\nJust to double-check, I can recall that in Thai language, \"gai\" is indeed the word for chicken. Here's a quick language lesson:\n\n- Gai (\u0e44\u0e01\u0e48) means chicken\n\n- Kung (\u0e01\u0e38\u0e49\u0e07) means shrimp\n\n- Neua (\u0e40\u0e19\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d) means beef\n\n- Moo (\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e39) means pork\n\nSo, according to this, \"gai\" is definitely chicken.\n\nTo wrap it up, if you ask for \"gai\" at a Thai restaurant, you will get chicken. Whether that's in a dish like green curry with chicken or simply grilled chicken, the protein you're ordering is chicken.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. chicken}} \\]"
