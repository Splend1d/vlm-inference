                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about Freud's defense mechanisms. It's been a while since I studied psychology, but I think I can figure this out. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nChantal says that her mother is domineering and overbearing. But all of Chantal's friends agree that she is the one who has these characteristics, not her mother. Freud would suggest that Chantal's behavior exemplifies which of the following defense mechanisms?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Repression\n\nB. Regression\n\nC. Projection\n\nD. Displacement\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what's going on here. Chantal is attributing negative traits to her mother that her friends see in her instead. That sounds like she's projecting her own qualities onto someone else, especially since it's negative traits.\n\nLet me recall what each of these defense mechanisms is:\n\nA. Repression: This is when unpleasant thoughts or feelings are pushed out of conscious awareness. It's like burying something deep inside so you don't have to deal with it.\n\nB. Regression: This is when a person reverts to an earlier stage of development in terms of behavior. Like, acting like a child when under stress.\n\nC. Projection: This is when someone attributes their own unacceptable desires or feelings to someone else. Basically, seeing your own negative traits in others.\n\nD. Displacement: This is when frustration or anger is redirected from the actual source to a safer or more acceptable target.\n\nGiven that, Chantal is seeing her own domineering and overbearing qualities in her mother, even though others see it in her. That sounds a lot like projection.\n\nLet me think of an example to confirm. Suppose Chantal feels domineering, but she doesn't want to acknowledge that about herself. So, she might say that her mother is domineering instead, projecting her own trait onto her mother.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. Repression would be more about pushing down her own feelings of being domineering, not attributing them to someone else.\n\nRegression might involve Chantal acting in a domineering way because she feels like a child in her mother's presence, but that doesn't seem to fit the scenario as described.\n\nDisplacement would involve Chantal having frustration with someone else and taking it out on her mother, but that's not what's happening here. She's attributing negative traits to her mother, not redirecting anger.\n\nSo, based on this, projection seems to be the most fitting defense mechanism at play here.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any possibility of another mechanism being involved. Maybe denial? But no, denial is when you refuse to accept reality, like pretending something isn't happening when it is. In this case, Chantal is acknowledging that someone is domineering, just attributing it to the wrong person.\n\nWhat about reaction formation? That's when you express feelings that are the opposite of what you really feel. For example, hating someone but acting overly nice to them. But that doesn't seem to apply here.\n\nOr maybe rationalization? Making excuses for behavior. Like, \"I'm only domineering because my mother was the same way.\" But again, that's not quite what's happening.\n\nNo, I think projection is the strongest fit here. Chantal is projecting her own domineering tendencies onto her mother.\n\nI remember that Freud believed that defense mechanisms are ways the ego protects itself from anxiety by distorting reality. Projection is one such mechanism where the ego denies its own unacceptable impulses and attributes them to others.\n\nSo, in Chantal's case, she might feel uncomfortable acknowledging that she is domineering and overbearing, so she projects those qualities onto her mother instead.\n\nThat seems consistent with what the question is describing. Her friends see her as domineering, but she insists it's her mother who has those traits.\n\nTherefore, I would conclude that Freud would suggest Chantal's behavior exemplifies projection.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C.
