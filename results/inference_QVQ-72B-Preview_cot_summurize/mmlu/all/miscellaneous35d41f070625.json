                    "text": "So I'm trying to remember this episode from Seinfeld where George Costanza sits on something called \"fusilli Jerry.\" I think it's a type of pasta, right? But anyway, he sits on it and then goes to see a doctor. The question is asking what type of doctor he went to see, and the options are ophthalmologist, cardiologist, neurologist, or proctologist.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what happens in that episode. I remember that George was hiding under a table or something and ended up sitting on a piece of fusilli pasta. It must have been painful or uncomfortable, which is why he went to see a doctor.\n\nNow, let's think about what each type of doctor specializes in:\n\n- Ophthalmologist: They deal with eyes and vision problems.\n\n- Cardiologist: They specialize in heart diseases and disorders.\n\n- Neurologist: They focus on the nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord.\n\n- Proctologist: They specialize in disorders of the rectum and anus, which is part of the digestive system.\n\nGiven that George sat on something, it's likely that he experienced discomfort in the pelvic or rectal area. So, an ophthalmologist doesn't seem relevant unless there was some eye involvement, which I don't recall.\n\nA cardiologist deals with the heart, and again, sitting on something wouldn't directly affect the heart unless there was some trauma, which I don't think happened in the episode.\n\nA neurologist focuses on the nervous system. Maybe if George experienced numbness or tingling, but I think the main issue was more about local pain.\n\nA proctologist specializes in the rectum and anus. Sitting on something could potentially cause issues in that area, especially if the object was sharp or caused some injury.\n\nLet me try to recall more details from the episode. I think George was hiding under a table during a robbery or something and ended up sitting on a piece of fusilli pasta, which is curved and pointed at the ends. It probably poked him in a sensitive area.\n\nConsidering the location and the type of discomfort he likely experienced, it makes sense that he would go see a proctologist. That's the doctor who would be best suited to handle any issues related to the rectum or anus.\n\nI don't remember any specific scenes where he complained of eye problems, heart issues, or neurological symptoms related to sitting on the pasta. So, eliminating those options, proctologist seems the most fitting choice.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should consider if there was any joke or twist in the episode where he actually went to see another type of doctor. But no, I think it was straightforward. He sat on the pasta, experienced discomfort in that region, and went to see the appropriate specialist.\n\nSo, my final answer is D. proctologist.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
