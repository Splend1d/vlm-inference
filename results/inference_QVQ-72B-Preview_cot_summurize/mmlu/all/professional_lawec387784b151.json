He had served as a state trooper since 1978, and in 1998, he became fully qualified for his pension upon retirement. In 2006, the trooper retired and immediately started receiving monthly state pension checks. In 2009, the governor of the state signed into law a statute, which provided in part:\"Section 8.

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a state trooper who was convicted of taking bribes in 2008 and was sentenced to probation. He had been a state trooper since 1978 and retired in 2006, starting to receive his state pension right away. In 1998, he became fully qualified for his pension upon retirement. Then, in 2009, the governor signed a law that says if a member of the state law enforcement is convicted of bribery, they can't receive any retirement benefits from the state. This conviction is considered a breach of their employment contract. The law is retroactive to December 31, 1975, and took effect immediately.\n\nSo, after this law was passed, the trooper got a letter saying his pension benefits are being discontinued because of his 2008 bribery conviction. He contacted a lawyer who challenged the discontinuance, arguing that the new law is unconstitutional. But let's assume that the state's highest court holds the statute constitutional. Now, the question is, under which circumstance might the trooper still be able to have his pension reinstated?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. He exercises his constitutional right to discretionary review in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nB. He receives a presidential pardon for his bribery offense.\n\nC. He can show that he was convicted before the effective date of the statute.\n\nD. He can show that the statute violates the dormant commerce clause.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, option A suggests that if he exercises his constitutional right to discretionary review in the U.S. Supreme Court, he might have his pension reinstated. Well, the Supreme Court has discretionary review, meaning they can choose whether to hear a case or not. If they agree to hear the case and rule in his favor, perhaps finding the law unconstitutional, then yes, his pension might be reinstated. But this is speculative. The Supreme Court might not take the case, or even if they do, they might uphold the law. So, this seems like a possibility but not a certainty.\n\nOption B is about receiving a presidential pardon for his bribery offense. A presidential pardon can forgive a federal crime and restore certain rights. But in this case, the conviction was in federal court, so a presidential pardon could potentially erase the conviction. If the conviction is pardoned, then the basis for discontinuing his pension is removed. So, this could lead to his pension being reinstated. However, pardons are discretionary and not guaranteed.\n\nOption C says he can show that he was convicted before the effective date of the statute. The statute was signed in 2009 and took effect immediately, with retroactivity to December 31, 1975. His conviction was in 2008, which is after December 31, 1975, but before the law was passed in 2009. The law is retroactive to 1975, so his 2008 conviction falls within that retroactive period. Therefore, showing that he was convicted before the effective date of the statute wouldn't help him because the law applies retroactively to 1975. So, this seems unlikely to lead to reinstatement of his pension.\n\nOption D suggests that if he can show the statute violates the dormant commerce clause, his pension might be reinstated. The dormant commerce clause is a principle derived from the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits states from passing legislation that improperly burdens or discriminates against interstate commerce. It's not immediately clear how this would apply to a state law revoking pension benefits for law enforcement officers convicted of bribery. Unless the law affects interstate commerce in some specific way, which isn't evident from the information provided, this seems like a stretch.\n\nGiven these considerations, option B seems the most straightforward path to potentially reinstating his pension. If he receives a presidential pardon for his bribery offense, the conviction that triggered the discontinuation of his pension would be nullified, and thus, there would be no basis for denying him his pension.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that a pardon is a discretionary act and not something that can be guaranteed or compelled through legal action. It's also worth considering that even if his conviction is pardoned, the state might have other grounds or policies for denying or reducing pension benefits, but based on the information provided, the primary reason for discontinuing his pension is the bribery conviction.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the trooper might be able to have his pension reinstated if he receives a presidential pardon for his bribery offense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
