                    "text": "So I need to find out how many odd perfect squares are between 5 and 211. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a perfect square is. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 1 is 1\u00b2, 4 is 2\u00b2, 9 is 3\u00b2, and so on.\n\nNow, I need to find perfect squares that are odd and lie between 5 and 211. Let me list out some perfect squares and see which ones are odd and fall within this range.\n\nLet's list perfect squares starting from 3 upwards because 1\u00b2 is 1, which is less than 5.\n\n3\u00b2 = 9\n\n4\u00b2 = 16\n\n5\u00b2 = 25\n\n6\u00b2 = 36\n\n7\u00b2 = 49\n\n8\u00b2 = 64\n\n9\u00b2 = 81\n\n10\u00b2 = 100\n\n11\u00b2 = 121\n\n12\u00b2 = 144\n\n13\u00b2 = 169\n\n14\u00b2 = 196\n\n15\u00b2 = 225\n\n16\u00b2 = 256, which is greater than 211, so we can stop here.\n\nNow, I need to identify which of these are odd. I recall that the square of an odd number is odd, and the square of an even number is even. So, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 are odd numbers, and their squares should be odd.\n\nWait, but 3\u00b2 is 9, which is odd; 5\u00b2 is 25, odd; 7\u00b2 is 49, odd; 9\u00b2 is 81, odd; 11\u00b2 is 121, odd; 13\u00b2 is 169, odd; 15\u00b2 is 225, which is odd.\n\nAlso, 4\u00b2 is 16, even; 6\u00b2 is 36, even; 8\u00b2 is 64, even; 10\u00b2 is 100, even; 12\u00b2 is 144, even; 14\u00b2 is 196, even; 16\u00b2 is 256, even.\n\nSo, the odd perfect squares between 5 and 211 are 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, 169, and 225.\n\nLet me confirm if all these are within the range:\n\n9 is greater than 5 and less than 211.\n\n25 is within the range.\n\n49 is within the range.\n\n81 is within the range.\n\n121 is within the range.\n\n169 is within the range.\n\n225 is within the range.\n\nSo, there are 7 odd perfect squares between 5 and 211.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check if there are any others I might have missed. Starting from 3\u00b2 up to 15\u00b2, and excluding even squares, I think I have them all.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of finding the range of integers whose squares fall within the given interval.\n\nSo, for a number x, we have 5 < x\u00b2 < 211.\n\nTaking square roots, we get approximately 2.236 < x < 14.526.\n\nSince x must be an integer, x can be 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.\n\nNow, among these, we need only the odd integers because we're looking for odd perfect squares.\n\nSo, x can be 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13.\n\nLet me count them: 3,5,7,9,11,13. That's 6 odd integers.\n\nBut earlier I listed 7 odd perfect squares. Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nLet me list the squares again:\n\n3\u00b2 = 9\n\n5\u00b2 = 25\n\n7\u00b2 = 49\n\n9\u00b2 = 81\n\n11\u00b2 = 121\n\n13\u00b2 = 169\n\n15\u00b2 = 225\n\nSo, that's 7 squares, but 15 is also odd, and 15\u00b2 = 225, which is within 211. Wait, 225 is greater than 211. Did I make a mistake earlier?\n\nWait, 15\u00b2 is indeed 225, which is greater than 211. So, 15 is out of range.\n\nTherefore, only up to 14\u00b2 = 196 is within the range.\n\nSo, the odd x values are 3,5,7,9,11,13, which is 7 numbers.\n\nWait, but 13\u00b2 = 169, which is within 211, and 15\u00b2 = 225, which is above 211.\n\nSo, x can be 3,5,7,9,11,13. That's 6 odd integers, but earlier I included 15, which is out of range.\n\nWait, but 13\u00b2 is 169, which is within 211, and 15\u00b2 is 225, which is above 211.\n\nSo, the odd integers x for which x\u00b2 is between 5 and 211 are x = 3,5,7,9,11,13. That's 6 numbers, but earlier I counted 7.\n\nWait, perhaps I mistakenly included 15 earlier. So, x = 3,5,7,9,11,13, that's 6 odd perfect squares: 9,25,49,81,121,169.\n\nBut earlier I thought 225 was within the range, but it's actually above 211. So, 15\u00b2 = 225 is out of range.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 odd perfect squares between 5 and 211.\n\nWait, but in my initial list, I included 225, which is above 211, so it shouldn't be counted.\n\nSo, the correct count is 6, not 7.\n\nMaybe I was mistaken earlier.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\n3\u00b2 = 9\n\n5\u00b2 = 25\n\n7\u00b2 = 49\n\n9\u00b2 = 81\n\n11\u00b2 = 121\n\n13\u00b2 = 169\n\n15\u00b2 = 225 (exceeds 211)\n\nSo, only 6 odd perfect squares are within the range.\n\nBut wait, the answer options include 6, which is option C.\n\nBut I think I might have missed something.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nIs 225 less than or equal to 211? No, 225 > 211, so it's not included.\n\nTherefore, only up to 13\u00b2 = 169 is within the range.\n\nSo, the odd perfect squares are 9,25,49,81,121,169. That's 6 numbers.\n\nBut earlier, I thought there were 7, but that was a mistake because 225 is above 211.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 6, which is option C.\n\nBut let's see if there are any other odd perfect squares that I might have missed.\n\nIs there any other odd integer x where x\u00b2 is between 5 and 211?\n\nWe already have x from 3 to 13, odd numbers.\n\nNo, that's all.\n\nTherefore, the number of odd perfect squares between 5 and 211 is 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
