                    "text": "So I have this problem about an electric dipole. There are two charges, equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, each 4.0 nanocoulombs, and they're separated by 2.0 centimeters. I need to find the electric field strength at the point that's exactly midway between them. The options are zero, 9.0 times 10 to the power of 4 volts per meter, 1.8 times 10 to the 5, or 7.2 times 10 to the 5 volts per meter.\n\nFirst, I should recall what an electric dipole is. It's two point charges that are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, separated by a small distance. The electric field around a dipole has a specific pattern, with field lines starting from the positive charge and ending at the negative charge.\n\nSince the point I'm interested in is midway between the charges, I can use the principle of superposition to find the total electric field there. That means I calculate the electric field due to each charge separately and then add them vectorially.\n\nLet's start by finding the electric field due to the positive charge. The formula for the electric field due to a point charge is:\n\n\\[E = k \\times \\frac{q}{r^2}\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(k\\) is Coulomb's constant, which is approximately \\(8.99 \\times 10^9\\) N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\u00b2.\n\n- \\(q\\) is the magnitude of the charge.\n\n- \\(r\\) is the distance from the charge to the point where we're calculating the field.\n\nSimilarly, the electric field due to the negative charge would be:\n\n\\[E = k \\times \\frac{-q}{r^2}\\]\n\nSince the charges are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, their electric fields will have the same magnitude but different directions.\n\nNow, at the midpoint, the distance \\(r\\) from each charge is half the separation distance. Given that the charges are 2.0 cm apart, the midpoint is 1.0 cm from each charge.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says the separation is 2.0 cm, which is 0.02 meters. So, the midpoint is at 0.01 meters from each charge.\n\nBut actually, I should double-check that. If the charges are separated by 2.0 cm, then half of that is indeed 1.0 cm, which is 0.01 meters.\n\nSo, for both charges, \\(r = 0.01\\) meters.\n\nNow, plugging in the values:\n\nFirst, convert the charge from nanocoulombs to coulombs. 1 nanocoulomb is \\(1 \\times 10^{-9}\\) coulombs, so 4.0 nC is \\(4.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\) C.\n\nThus, the electric field due to the positive charge is:\n\n\\[E_{+} = 8.99 \\times 10^9 \\times \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-9}}{(0.01)^2}\\]\n\nSimilarly, the electric field due to the negative charge is:\n\n\\[E_{-} = 8.99 \\times 10^9 \\times \\frac{-4.0 \\times 10^{-9}}{(0.01)^2}\\]\n\nLet me calculate the denominator first:\n\n\\[(0.01)^2 = 0.0001\\]\n\nSo, both fields have the same magnitude:\n\n\\[E = 8.99 \\times 10^9 \\times \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-9}}{0.0001} = 8.99 \\times 4.0 \\times 10^{9-9+4} = 8.99 \\times 4.0 \\times 10^{4}\\]\n\n\\[8.99 \\times 4.0 = 35.96\\]\n\n\\[35.96 \\times 10^{4} = 3.596 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\text{V/m}\\]\n\nSo, each charge produces an electric field of approximately \\(3.6 \\times 10^{5}\\) V/m at the midpoint.\n\nNow, since the positive charge produces a field pointing away from it and the negative charge produces a field pointing towards it, at the midpoint, both fields are pointing in the same direction: from the positive charge towards the negative charge.\n\nTherefore, the total electric field at the midpoint is the sum of these two fields:\n\n\\[E_{\\text{total}} = E_{+} + E_{-} = 3.596 \\times 10^{5} + 3.596 \\times 10^{5} = 7.192 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\text{V/m}\\]\n\nRounding to two significant figures, that's approximately \\(7.2 \\times 10^{5}\\) V/m.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 7.2 \u00d7 10^5 V/m seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a second, is there a better way to calculate this, perhaps using the electric field formula for a dipole?\n\nI recall that for an electric dipole, the electric field at a point along the axis is given by:\n\n\\[E = \\frac{2kqd}{(r^2 - d^2/4)^2}\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(k\\) is Coulomb's constant,\n\n- \\(q\\) is the magnitude of the charge,\n\n- \\(d\\) is the separation distance between the charges,\n\n- \\(r\\) is the distance from the center of the dipole to the point where we're calculating the field.\n\nBut in this case, since we're at the midpoint (\\(r = d/2\\)), this formula might not be directly applicable or necessary.\n\nAlternatively, for points close to the dipole, the electric field along the axis is approximately:\n\n\\[E = \\frac{2kqd}{r^3}\\]\n\nGiven that \\(r = d/2\\), we can substitute:\n\n\\[E = \\frac{2kqd}{(d/2)^3} = \\frac{2kqd}{d^3/8} = \\frac{16kqd}{d^3} = \\frac{16kq}{d^2}\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[E = 16 \\times 8.99 \\times 10^9 \\times 4.0 \\times 10^{-9} / (0.02)^2\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\((0.02)^2 = 0.0004\\)\n\nThen:\n\n\\[E = 16 \\times 8.99 \\times 4.0 \\times 10^{9-9-4}\\]\n\n\\[16 \\times 8.99 = 143.84\\]\n\n\\[143.84 \\times 4.0 = 575.36\\]\n\n\\[575.36 / 0.0004 = 1,438,400 \\, \\text{V/m}\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't match my previous calculation. I must have made a mistake here.\n\nLet me check the formula again. The electric field along the axis of a dipole is indeed:\n\n\\[E = \\frac{2kqd}{r^3}\\]\n\nBut perhaps I misapplied it. Let's think differently.\n\nThe dipole moment \\(\\vec{p}\\) is defined as \\(q \\times d\\), considering the direction from the negative to the positive charge.\n\nThe electric field along the axis is:\n\n\\[E = \\frac{2kqd}{r^3}\\]\n\nGiven that \\(r = d/2\\), substitute:\n\n\\[E = \\frac{2kqd}{(d/2)^3} = \\frac{2kqd}{d^3/8} = \\frac{16kqd}{d^3} = \\frac{16kq}{d^2}\\]\n\nNow, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[k = 8.99 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{N m}^2/\\text{C}^2\\]\n\n\\[q = 4.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{C}\\]\n\n\\[d = 0.02 \\, \\text{m}\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[E = 16 \\times 8.99 \\times 10^9 \\times 4.0 \\times 10^{-9} / (0.02)^2\\]\n\n\\[16 \\times 8.99 = 143.84\\]\n\n\\[143.84 \\times 4.0 = 575.36\\]\n\n\\[(0.02)^2 = 0.0004\\]\n\n\\[E = 575.36 / 0.0004 = 1,438,400 \\, \\text{V/m}\\]\n\nWait, but this seems too high. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the electric field due to a dipole along the axis:\n\n\\[E = \\frac{2kqd}{r^3}\\]\n\nGiven \\(r = d/2\\), substitute:\n\n\\[E = \\frac{2kqd}{(d/2)^3} = \\frac{2kqd}{d^3/8} = \\frac{16kqd}{d^3} = \\frac{16kq}{d^2}\\]\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\[E = 16 \\times 8.99 \\times 10^9 \\times 4.0 \\times 10^{-9} / (0.02)^2\\]\n\n\\[16 \\times 8.99 = 143.84\\]\n\n\\[143.84 \\times 4.0 = 575.36\\]\n\n\\[(0.02)^2 = 0.0004\\]\n\n\\[E = 575.36 / 0.0004 = 1,438,400 \\, \\text{V/m}\\]\n\nThis doesn't match my earlier calculation of approximately \\(7.2 \\times 10^{5}\\) V/m. There must be an error in my approach.\n\nLet me think again. Perhaps I misapplied the formula. The formula \\(E = \\frac{2kqd}{r^3}\\) is for the electric field along the axis of the dipole, but I need to confirm if this is applicable at the midpoint.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the vector components. Let's try that.\n\nConsider the positive charge on the left and the negative charge on the right, separated by 2 cm (0.02 m). The midpoint is 1 cm (0.01 m) from each charge.\n\nThe electric field due to the positive charge points away from it, and the electric field due to the negative charge points towards it. Since both fields point in the same direction at the midpoint (from positive to negative), they add up.\n\nSo, \\(E_{\\text{total}} = E_{+} + E_{-}\\)\n\nFirst, calculate \\(E_{+}\\):\n\n\\[E_{+} = k \\times \\frac{q}{r^2} = 8.99 \\times 10^9 \\times \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-9}}{(0.01)^2} = 3.596 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\text{V/m}\\]\n\nSimilarly, \\(E_{-} = 3.596 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\text{V/m}\\)\n\nAdding them up:\n\n\\[E_{\\text{total}} = 3.596 \\times 10^{5} + 3.596 \\times 10^{5} = 7.192 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\text{V/m}\\]\n\nThis matches my initial calculation and corresponds to option D.\n\nBut why did the dipole formula give me a different result? Maybe I misremembered the formula.\n\nLet me look up the correct formula for the electric field along the axis of a dipole.\n\nThe electric field along the axis of a dipole is indeed:\n\n\\[E = \\frac{2kqd}{(r^2 + d^2/4)^2}\\]\n\nBut at the midpoint, \\(r = d/2\\), so:\n\n\\[E = \\frac{2kqd}{( (d/2)^2 + d^2/4 )^2} = \\frac{2kqd}{( d^2/4 + d^2/4 )^2} = \\frac{2kqd}{(d^2/2)^2} = \\frac{2kqd}{d^4/4} = \\frac{8kqd}{d^4} = \\frac{8kq}{d^3}\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, for points along the axis and close to the dipole, the electric field is approximately:\n\n\\[E = \\frac{2kqd}{r^3}\\]\n\nGiven that, at \\(r = d/2\\):\n\n\\[E = \\frac{2kqd}{(d/2)^3} = \\frac{2kqd}{d^3/8} = \\frac{16kqd}{d^3} = \\frac{16kq}{d^2}\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[E = 16 \\times 8.99 \\times 10^9 \\times 4.0 \\times 10^{-9} / (0.02)^2\\]\n\n\\[16 \\times 8.99 = 143.84\\]\n\n\\[143.84 \\times 4.0 = 575.36\\]\n\n\\[(0.02)^2 = 0.0004\\]\n\n\\[E = 575.36 / 0.0004 = 1,438,400 \\, \\text{V/m}\\]\n\nThis is still not matching my previous calculation of \\(7.2 \\times 10^{5}\\) V/m.\n\nPerhaps the formula \\(E = \\frac{2kqd}{r^3}\\) is not applicable here, or I'm misapplying it.\n\nLet me try to calculate the dipole moment first. The dipole moment \\(p\\) is \\(q \\times d\\):\n\n\\[p = 4.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{C} \\times 0.02 \\, \\text{m} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{C m}\\]\n\nThe electric field along the axis is:\n\n\\[E = \\frac{2k p}{r^3}\\]\n\nAt \\(r = d/2 = 0.01\\) m:\n\n\\[E = \\frac{2 \\times 8.99 \\times 10^9 \\times 8.0 \\times 10^{-11}}{(0.01)^3} = \\frac{1.4384 \\times 10^{1}}{0.000001} = 1,438,400 \\, \\text{V/m}\\]\n\nAgain, this doesn't match my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the direction and the vector components more carefully.\n\nLet me consider the electric field due to each charge separately, including the direction.\n\nThe electric field due to the positive charge points away from it, and the electric field due to the negative charge points towards it. At the midpoint, both fields point in the same direction, so they add up directly.\n\nThus, \\(E_{\\text{total}} = E_{+} + E_{-} = 2 \\times E_{+}\\)\n\nGiven that \\(E_{+} = 3.596 \\times 10^{5}\\) V/m, then \\(E_{\\text{total}} = 7.192 \\times 10^{5}\\) V/m, which rounds to \\(7.2 \\times 10^{5}\\) V/m.\n\nThis seems consistent, and matches option D.\n\nPerhaps the dipole formula I used earlier is not applicable in this scenario, or I misapplied it.\n\nLet me check the standard formula for the electric field along the axis of a dipole.\n\nThe electric field along the axis is indeed:\n\n\\[E = \\frac{2k p}{r^3}\\]\n\nWhere \\(p = qd\\) is the dipole moment.\n\nGiven \\(p = 4.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{C} \\times 0.02 \\, \\text{m} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{C m}\\)\n\nAnd \\(r = 0.01\\) m.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[E = \\frac{2 \\times 8.99 \\times 10^9 \\times 8.0 \\times 10^{-11}}{(0.01)^3} = \\frac{1.4384 \\times 10^{1}}{0.000001} = 1,438,400 \\, \\text{V/m}\\]\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that I might have made a mistake in applying the dipole formula.\n\nUpon further reflection, I realize that the formula \\(E = \\frac{2k p}{r^3}\\) is for the electric field along the axis of the dipole, but it assumes that \\(r\\) is much larger than \\(d\\), which is not the case here since \\(r = d/2\\).\n\nIn this problem, \\(r\\) is not much larger than \\(d\\), so the standard dipole approximation doesn't hold, and I should use the exact superposition of the fields from each charge.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach of calculating the field due to each charge separately and adding them is correct.\n\nThus, the electric field at the midpoint is \\(7.2 \\times 10^{5}\\) V/m, which corresponds to option D.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
