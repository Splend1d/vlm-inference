                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of these organs comes in a pair?\" and the options are liver, kidney, stomach, and gallbladder. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that some organs in the human body come in pairs, like the eyes or the ears, but I'm not sure about these specific ones. Let me think about each one individually.\n\nStarting with the liver: I recall that the liver is a pretty big organ in the abdomen, and I don't think there are two of them. It's responsible for things like detoxifying substances and producing bile. So, I'm pretty sure the liver is a single organ, not a pair.\n\nNext is the kidney. Now, I think there are two kidneys in the human body. They're located on either side of the spine, kind of towards the back. They're important for filtering waste products from the blood and regulating fluids. So, if I remember correctly, there are two kidneys, making them a pair.\n\nThe stomach: That's another organ in the abdomen, and I believe it's a single organ. It's where a lot of digestion happens, and it stores food before passing it on to the intestines. So, I don't think there are two stomachs in the human body.\n\nLastly, the gallbladder. This is a small organ that stores bile, which helps digest fats. It's usually located near the liver. And, as far as I know, there's only one gallbladder in the human body.\n\nSo, based on this, the only organ among these options that comes in a pair is the kidney.\n\nWait a minute, just to make sure, maybe I should double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing about one of these organs.\n\nLet me consider if any of these organs have multiple parts or something like that. For example, the liver does have lobes, but it's still considered one organ, right? Similarly, the stomach has different regions, but it's still a single organ.\n\nThe gallbladder, again, is just one organ. So, yeah, the kidneys are the only ones that come in a pair.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll think about some other organs that do come in pairs. There are the lungs, which are two, the heart is one, the brain is one, although it has two hemispheres, but that's different from being two separate organs.\n\nSo, sticking with my initial thought, the correct answer should be kidney.\n\nOh, but the question says \"which of these organs comes in a pair?\" and lists liver, kidney, stomach, and gallbladder. Since kidneys are the only ones that come in a pair, that should be the answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. kidney}} \\]"
