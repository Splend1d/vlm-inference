Dangers and difficulties, instead of deterring, seemed to have a charm in his eyes.\u2026 He conceived, at the first moment of his landing in Mexico, the design of its conquest. When he saw the strength of its civilization, he was not turned from his purpose.\u2026 This spirit of knight-errantry might lead us to undervalue his talents as a general, and to regard him merely in the light of a lucky adventurer. But this would be doing him injustice; for Cortes was certainly a great general, if that man be one, who performs great achievements with the resources which his own genius has created. There is probably no instance in history, where so vast an enterprise has been achieved by means apparently so inadequate.\u2026 He brought together the most miscellaneous collection of mercenaries who ever fought under one standard: adventurers from Cuba and the Isles, craving for gold; hidalgos, who came from the old country to win laurels; \u2026 wild tribes of the natives from all parts of the country, who had been sworn enemies from their cradles, and who had met only to cut one another's throats, and to procure victims for sacrifice; men, in short, differing in race, in language, and in interests, with scarcely anything in common among them. Yet this motley congregation was assembled in one camp, compelled to bend to the will of one man, to consort together in harmony, to breathe, as it were, one spirit, and to move on a common principle of action!\n\u2014William Hickling Prescott, History of the Conquest of Mexico, 1843\nAs Prescott makes clear in the passage above, an important reason for Cortes's military success was which of the following?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Hernando Cortes and his conquest of Mexico. The passage is from William Hickling Prescott's \"History of the Conquest of Mexico,\" written in 1843. It paints Cortes as a romantic and adventurous figure, filled with the spirit of enterprise, who was undeterred by dangers and difficulties. The passage emphasizes that Cortes had the vision to conquer Mexico from the moment he landed there, despite recognizing the strength and civilization of the land he aimed to conquer.\n\nPrescott mentions that Cortes was not just a lucky adventurer but a great general, capable of achieving remarkable feats with limited resources. He highlights that Cortes assembled a diverse and seemingly incompatible group of soldiers\u2014mercenaries from Cuba and the islands seeking gold, Spanish noblemen (hidalgos) eager for glory, and native tribes who were traditional enemies\u2014all of whom were united under Cortes's command.\n\nThe passage describes this assembly as a \"motley congregation,\" emphasizing the varied backgrounds, languages, and interests of the soldiers. Despite these differences, Cortes managed to instill a sense of unity and common purpose among them, compelling them to follow his will and work together harmoniously.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the important reasons for Cortes's military success, based on Prescott's passage. The options are:\n\nA. The advantage of superior numbers\n\nB. The superior military skill of mercenaries\n\nC. Taking advantage of divisions among the Indians\n\nD. Effective use of European artillery\n\nLet's evaluate each option in light of the information provided.\n\nOption A: The advantage of superior numbers\n\nThe passage doesn't explicitly mention the size of Cortes's army compared to that of the indigenous peoples. Given that Cortes was leading a group of adventurers and mercenaries from Cuba and the islands, supplemented by native tribes, it's possible that his forces were smaller in number compared to the indigenous populations he faced. However, the passage emphasizes the diversity and initial incompatibility of his forces rather than their numerical strength.\n\nOption B: The superior military skill of mercenaries\n\nThe passage does mention that Cortes assembled mercenaries who were adventurers from Cuba and the islands, craving for gold. These mercenaries likely had some military experience, but the passage doesn't specify their level of military skill or how it compared to that of the indigenous warriors. Moreover, the mercenaries were part of a larger, diverse force that included hidalgos and native tribes, so it's not clear if their military skill was the key factor in Cortes's success.\n\nOption C: Taking advantage of divisions among the Indians\n\nThis option seems particularly relevant based on the passage. Prescott notes that among Cortes's forces were \"wild tribes of the natives from all parts of the country, who had been sworn enemies from their cradles, and who had met only to cut one another's throats, and to procure victims for sacrifice.\" This suggests that Cortes was able to recruit natives who were enemies of one another, possibly because they shared a common enemy in the Aztecs or other powerful indigenous groups.\n\nFurthermore, the passage mentions that these diverse groups were compelled to bend to the will of one man, Cortes, and to move on a common principle of action. This implies that Cortes was skilled in diplomacy and alliance-building, leveraging the divisions among the indigenous peoples to unite them under his command against a common foe.\n\nOption D: Effective use of European artillery\n\nWhile European technology, including firearms and cannons, played a role in the conquest of the Americas, the passage doesn't specifically mention the use of artillery. It focuses more on the composition of Cortes's army and his ability to unite diverse groups rather than on the technological advantages he may have had.\n\nConsidering the information provided in the passage, option C\u2014taking advantage of divisions among the Indians\u2014seems to be the most directly supported reason for Cortes's military success. The passage highlights his ability to assemble and command a diverse and potentially conflicting group of soldiers, including native tribes who were traditional enemies, and to instill in them a sense of unity and common purpose.\n\nThis suggests that Cortes was adept at forming alliances and managing internal conflicts within his army, which likely gave him an advantage in his military campaigns against other indigenous groups. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that exploiting divisions among the indigenous peoples was a crucial factor in his success.\n\nHowever, to ensure a thorough understanding, it's worth considering whether other options might also be relevant. For example, European technology, including horses and firearms, is known to have given Cortes an advantage over the indigenous peoples. But the passage doesn't mention these aspects, so it's not possible to confirm their significance based on this specific excerpt.\n\nSimilarly, the passage doesn't provide information about the numbers of troops Cortes commanded or whether he had superiority in numbers. Therefore, option A cannot be substantiated from the given passage.\n\nOption B refers to the superior military skill of mercenaries, but the passage only mentions that mercenaries were part of the force, seeking gold, without commenting on their military capabilities compared to others in the army or to the indigenous warriors.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the passage, the best answer is option C: taking advantage of divisions among the Indians.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
