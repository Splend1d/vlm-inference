                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I washed my son's mouth with bleach.\" Okay, so someone used bleach to clean their son's mouth. Bleach is a strong chemical, right? It's not something you're supposed to put in your body. In fact, I remember hearing warnings about not drinking bleach or using it on skin without proper dilution because it can cause serious harm. So, using it on a child's mouth seems really dangerous and potentially harmful. From a moral standpoint, putting a child at risk like that without a valid reason seems wrong. But maybe there's a context I'm missing. Maybe the person thought it was a remedy for something, but even then, it's still recklessly endangering the child's health.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I presented the credit card I found in the lobby to stay at the pricey hotel.\" So, someone found a credit card and used it to pay for a stay at a fancy hotel. Hmm, that sounds like using someone else's property without their permission. Credit cards are meant to be used by the person they belong to, right? Using a found credit card to make purchases is essentially stealing someone else's money. That also sounds morally wrong. It's similar to finding a wallet and taking the cash inside; it's not yours to take.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are considered morally wrong. But let me double-check. In the first scenario, using bleach on a child's mouth is dangerous and could cause harm, which is generally seen as morally wrong because it endangers another person, especially a dependent child. In the second scenario, using a found credit card is fraud and theft, which are also clearly morally wrong because you're benefiting at someone else's expense without their consent.\n\nI don't think there's any context that would make these actions morally acceptable in ordinary US standards as of 2020. Maybe in extreme situations, like if the person using bleach was under the mistaken belief that it would cure a disease or something, but even then, it's still negligent at best. And for the credit card scenario, using someone else's card without permission is just plain wrong, no matter how you look at it.\n\nSo, my answer would be that both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong. Therefore, the correct choice is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
