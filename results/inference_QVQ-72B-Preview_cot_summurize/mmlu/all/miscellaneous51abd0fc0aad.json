                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question about an electric fence for both mature cattle and sheep. The options are different wire heights: 6 inches, 18 inches, 40 inches, and 60 inches. I need to figure out which of these heights should be used for the wire to effectively contain both animals.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand the sizes of mature cattle and sheep. Cattle are generally larger than sheep, right? So, mature cattle might be quite big, maybe up to five or six feet tall at the shoulder. Sheep, on the other hand, are smaller, maybe up to three or four feet tall.\n\nNow, an electric fence needs to be high enough to prevent the animals from jumping over or reaching over to get to the other side. But it also needs to be low enough to prevent smaller animals from going under or through the fence.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nI. 6 inches \u2013 That seems really low. Even small sheep could easily step over that. So, I don't think that's sufficient.\n\nII. 18 inches \u2013 This might be okay for sheep, but cattle are taller. Maybe some cattle could jump over this, especially if they're not too big. But I need to consider larger cattle too.\n\nIII. 40 inches \u2013 That's about 3.3 feet. This might be good for sheep, but cattle might still be able to jump over, depending on their size.\n\nIV. 60 inches \u2013 That's 5 feet. This seems more suitable for cattle, but is it necessary for sheep?\n\nI need to find a height that accommodates both animals. If I choose only higher wires like 60 inches, it might be fine for cattle, but is that necessary for sheep? Maybe not, as sheep are smaller and might not need such a high fence.\n\nBut then, if the fence is too low, cattle could jump over it, which is a problem. So, I need a balance.\n\nOption D suggests using III and IV only, which are 40 inches and 60 inches. That might cover a good range: 40 inches for sheep and 60 inches for cattle.\n\nBut wait, if I have wires at 40 inches and 60 inches, would that be sufficient to contain both animals? For sheep, 40 inches might be high enough, and for cattle, 60 inches should be good.\n\nOption C is II and III only, which is 18 inches and 40 inches. That might not be high enough for cattle, as they could potentially jump over the 40-inch wire.\n\nOption B is II only, which is 18 inches. That's definitely too low for cattle.\n\nOption A is I only, which is 6 inches. That's way too low for both animals.\n\nSo, between the options, D seems the most reasonable. Having wires at both 40 inches and 60 inches would provide a good barrier for both sheep and cattle.\n\nBut let me think again. Is there a standard height for electric fences for livestock? I think for cattle, a fence height of around 48 to 60 inches is common, and for sheep, it's around 40 to 48 inches.\n\nSo, if I have wires at 40 inches and 60 inches, that covers both ranges.\n\nAlternatively, maybe having wires at multiple heights would be better, like every 12 inches or so, but the question specifies specific heights.\n\nI think the best answer is D, III and IV only, which are 40 inches and 60 inches.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there's any reason to include lower wires. For instance, might sheep try to go under a higher wire? If I have a 60-inch wire, would sheep try to go under it? Probably not, as they are not that agile, and a 60-inch wire is still quite high for them.\n\nPlus, electric fences usually have multiple wires spaced out, and the animals learn not to approach them. So, having wires at 40 inches and 60 inches should be sufficient to deter both animals.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D. III and IV only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
