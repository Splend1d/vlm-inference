                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about why a surviving spouse might die within the first year after losing their partner. The options are:\n\nA. Stress and loss of social support\n\nB. Having the same disorder as the deceased\n\nC. The inability to remarry quickly\n\nD. They have the same defective genes\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that losing a spouse can be an extremely stressful event. Stress can have a big impact on a person's health, both mentally and physically. So, option A mentions stress and loss of social support. It makes sense that when someone loses their partner, they might feel lonely or have less support in daily life. This could lead to health problems, especially if they don't have others to turn to for help and comfort.\n\nBut what about option B? Having the same disorder as the deceased. Well, if both spouses had the same health condition, maybe a chronic illness like heart disease or something genetic, then it's possible that the surviving spouse could also be at risk for the same issues. But I'm not sure how likely it is that both would have exactly the same disorder, especially if the cause of death is something like an accident or a sudden event not directly related to health.\n\nOption C says inability to remarry quickly. Hmm, this seems a bit odd. While remarrying might provide new social support, I don't think the speed of remarrying is the primary factor here. Plus, not everyone wants to remarry quickly after losing a spouse, and it's not a realistic option for many people. So, I'm thinking this might not be the main reason.\n\nOption D mentions having the same defective genes. This could be a factor if the couple shared certain genetic risks for specific diseases. For example, if both came from families with a history of a particular genetic disorder, they might both be more likely to develop that condition. However, this seems like it would be a relatively rare scenario, and not applicable to most couples.\n\nLet me consider this more scientifically. There's a concept called the \"widowhood effect,\" which refers to the observation that widowed individuals have a higher mortality rate in the months following their spouse's death compared to those who are married or single. Researchers have looked into various factors that contribute to this phenomenon.\n\nOne study found that the risk of dying is higher immediately after the loss of a spouse and decreases over time. This suggests that the initial shock and stress of the loss play a significant role. Stress can affect the immune system, making people more susceptible to diseases and health problems. Additionally, widowed individuals might engage in less healthy behaviors, such as eating poorly or exercising less, which can also impact their health.\n\nSocial support is another crucial factor. Spouses often provide each other with emotional and practical support. When one partner dies, the surviving spouse might lose that support, which can affect their mental and physical health. Loneliness can lead to depression, which is linked to various health issues, including heart disease and stroke.\n\nNow, considering all this, it seems that stress and loss of social support are the most immediate and direct factors contributing to the increased mortality risk in the first year after losing a spouse. Having the same disorder as the deceased or sharing defective genes might be relevant in some cases, but these are more individual-specific and not as generalizable.\n\nMoreover, the idea that the surviving spouse can't remarry quickly seems like a minor factor, if it's a factor at all. Remarriage rates vary widely based on age, culture, and personal preferences, so it's not a universal solution or risk factor for mortality.\n\nIn summary, based on the knowledge about the widowhood effect and the general impact of stress and social support on health, option A\u2014stress and loss of social support\u2014seems to be the most accurate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
