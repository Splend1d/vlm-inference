                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a cube floating in a fluid. Let's see what it's asking. There's a solid plastic cube with a side length of 0.5 meters and a mass of 100 kilograms. It's placed in a vat of fluid with a density of 1200 kilograms per cubic meter. I need to find out what fraction of the cube's volume is above the surface of the fluid.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how buoyancy works. I remember that when an object floats in a fluid, the weight of the fluid displaced by the object equals the weight of the object itself. That's Archimedes' principle, right?\n\nSo, the weight of the cube is equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. Since I'm dealing with masses and densities, I should probably work with forces in Newtons.\n\nLet me find the weight of the cube. The weight is mass times gravity. Assuming standard gravity, g = 9.81 m/s\u00b2. So, weight of the cube (W_cube) = 100 kg * 9.81 m/s\u00b2 = 981 N.\n\nNow, the buoyant force (F_buoy) is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. The volume of the fluid displaced is equal to the volume of the part of the cube that's submerged. Since it's a cube, its volume is side length cubed, but since only a part is submerged, I need to find the submerged volume.\n\nLet me denote the submerged volume as V_submerged. The total volume of the cube is V_total = (0.5 m)^3 = 0.125 m\u00b3.\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the buoyant force, which should equal the weight of the cube since it's floating.\n\nSo, F_buoy = \u03c1_fluid * g * V_submerged = W_cube\n\nTherefore, \u03c1_fluid * g * V_submerged = W_cube\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n1200 kg/m\u00b3 * 9.81 m/s\u00b2 * V_submerged = 981 N\n\nNow, solve for V_submerged:\n\nV_submerged = 981 N / (1200 kg/m\u00b3 * 9.81 m/s\u00b2) = 981 / (1200 * 9.81)\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 1200 * 9.81 = 11772 N/m\u00b3\n\nThen, V_submerged = 981 / 11772 m\u00b3\n\nHmm, 981 / 11772. Let's see, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 9.\n\n981 \u00f7 9 = 109\n\n11772 \u00f7 9 = 1308\n\nSo, V_submerged = 109/1308 m\u00b3\n\nBut that seems like an exact fraction, but maybe it can be simplified further. Let's check if 109 and 1308 have any common factors.\n\n109 is a prime number, I think, so it can't be simplified further.\n\nSo, V_submerged = 109/1308 m\u00b3\n\nBut maybe I should check my calculations again.\n\nWait, 981 divided by 11772:\n\n981 \u00f7 11772.\n\nActually, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 981 divided by 11772 would be less than 1, which doesn't seem right. Maybe I did the division wrong.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\n11772 \u00f7 981.\n\nWait, no: V_submerged = 981 / 11772\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n981 \u00f7 11772 \u2248 0.0833 m\u00b3\n\nBut that seems too small. Maybe I should keep it as a fraction for now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently.\n\nLet me consider the densities.\n\nThe cube has a mass of 100 kg and a volume of 0.125 m\u00b3, so its average density is 100 kg / 0.125 m\u00b3 = 800 kg/m\u00b3.\n\nThe fluid has a density of 1200 kg/m\u00b3.\n\nFor the cube to float, the weight of the fluid displaced must equal the weight of the cube.\n\nSo, the submerged volume V_submerged times the fluid density times g must equal the cube's weight.\n\nSo, V_submerged * 1200 kg/m\u00b3 * 9.81 m/s\u00b2 = 100 kg * 9.81 m/s\u00b2\n\nWait, that's what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the ratio of densities to find the fraction submerged.\n\nI recall that for floating objects, the fraction submerged is equal to the density of the object divided by the density of the fluid.\n\nSo, fraction submerged = density_cube / density_fluid = 800 / 1200 = 8/12 = 2/3\n\nSo, V_submerged / V_total = 2/3\n\nTherefore, V_submerged = (2/3) * 0.125 m\u00b3 = (2/3)*0.125 = (2/3)*(1/8) = 2/24 = 1/12 m\u00b3\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. 2/3 of 0.125 should be 0.0833... m\u00b3, which is 1/12 m\u00b3, yes.\n\nBut earlier, I had V_submerged = 109/1308 m\u00b3, which is approximately 0.0833 m\u00b3, which matches 1/12 m\u00b3.\n\nSo, V_submerged = 1/12 m\u00b3\n\nThen, the volume above the surface is V_total - V_submerged = 0.125 - 1/12 = 0.125 - 0.0833... = 0.0416... m\u00b3\n\nBut the question is asking for the fraction of the cube's volume that floats above the surface.\n\nSo, fraction above = V_above / V_total = (0.125 - 1/12) / 0.125\n\nLet me compute 1/12 in terms of 0.125.\n\n0.125 is 1/8, so 1 - 1/12 is 12/12 - 1/12 = 11/12\n\nWait, no. Wait, V_total is 0.125 m\u00b3, which is 1/8 m\u00b3, and V_submerged is 1/12 m\u00b3, so V_above = 1/8 - 1/12 = (3/24 - 2/24) = 1/24 m\u00b3\n\nThen, fraction above = (1/24) / (1/8) = (1/24)*(8/1) = 8/24 = 1/3\n\nSo, the fraction above is 1/3.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1.0/9\n\nB. 1.0/3\n\nC. 2.0/3\n\nD. 4.0/5\n\nSo, option B. 1.0/3 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nDensity of cube: 800 kg/m\u00b3\n\nDensity of fluid: 1200 kg/m\u00b3\n\nFraction submerged: 800/1200 = 2/3\n\nTherefore, fraction above: 1 - 2/3 = 1/3\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the buoyancy formula:\n\nF_buoy = \u03c1_fluid * g * V_submerged = W_cube\n\nV_submerged = W_cube / (\u03c1_fluid * g) = (100 kg * 9.81 m/s\u00b2) / (1200 kg/m\u00b3 * 9.81 m/s\u00b2) = 100/1200 = 1/12 m\u00b3\n\nThen, V_above = 0.125 - 1/12 = 1/8 - 1/12 = 1/3 of the total volume.\n\nWait, 1/8 - 1/12 = (3 - 2)/24 = 1/24 m\u00b3\n\nThen, fraction above = (1/24)/(1/8) = 1/3\n\nYes, consistently getting 1/3.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 1.0/3\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 1.0/3} \\]"
