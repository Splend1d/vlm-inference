                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: The ratio of \\(2x - y\\) to \\(x + y\\) is 2 to 3, and I need to find the ratio of \\(x\\) to \\(y\\), expressed as a common fraction. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to translate the given information into an equation. The ratio of \\(2x - y\\) to \\(x + y\\) is 2 to 3, so I can write that as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2x - y}{x + y} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nAlright, so my goal is to find \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\). I need to manipulate this equation to get \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in a form where they are directly compared.\n\nMaybe I can cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions. Cross-multiplying the above equation gives:\n\n\\[\n3(2x - y) = 2(x + y)\n\\]\n\nLet's expand both sides:\n\n\\[\n6x - 3y = 2x + 2y\n\\]\n\nNow, I can subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides to get:\n\n\\[\n4x - 3y = 2y\n\\]\n\nHmm, maybe I should get all terms involving \\(y\\) on one side. So, I'll add \\(3y\\) to both sides:\n\n\\[\n4x = 5y\n\\]\n\nNow, this looks promising. To find the ratio of \\(x\\) to \\(y\\), I can write:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{5}{4}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If \\(4x = 5y\\), then dividing both sides by \\(y\\) and also by 4:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{5}{4}\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nLet me just verify by plugging in some numbers to see if it makes sense. Suppose \\(x = 5\\) and \\(y = 4\\), then:\n\n\\[\n2x - y = 10 - 4 = 6\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx + y = 5 + 4 = 9\n\\]\n\nSo the ratio is \\(\\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{2}{3}\\), which matches the given ratio. Great, that seems to check out.\n\nAlternatively, I could have tried to solve for one variable in terms of the other, but I think the way I did it is correct.\n\nLet me consider if there's another approach. Maybe using proportions or something else, but I think the way I did it is the simplest.\n\nSo, the ratio of \\(x\\) to \\(y\\) is \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\)\n\nB. \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\)\n\nC. \\(\\frac{5}{2}\\)\n\nD. \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\)\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option A: \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\).\n\nI feel confident about this answer because the steps I took\u2014writing the ratio as an equation, cross-multiplying, and solving for \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\)\u2014all seem straightforward and logically consistent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{4}} \\]"
