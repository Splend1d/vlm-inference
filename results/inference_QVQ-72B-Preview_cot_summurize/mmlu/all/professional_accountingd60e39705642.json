                    "text": "So I have this question here about equity and bonds, and it's asking which statement is true of equity but not of bonds. Let me see what the options are.\n\nOption A says they can be issued by firms. Hmm, both equity and bonds can be issued by firms, right? Companies issue stocks (equity) to raise capital, and they also issue bonds as another way to borrow money. So, I think A is not the correct answer because bonds can also be issued by firms.\n\nOption B says their payouts, meaning dividends for equity and coupons for bonds, are made after corporation tax has already been deducted. Now, I remember that dividend payments for equity are indeed paid out of after-tax profits. But what about bond coupons? Are they also paid after tax? Let me think. Corporation tax is a tax on a company's profits, and typically, interest payments on bonds are tax-deductible expenses, meaning they reduce the taxable income before calculating corporation tax. So, effectively, bond coupons are paid before tax, whereas dividends are paid after tax. So, this would mean that option B is true for equity but not for bonds, because bond coupons are paid before tax.\n\nOption C says their payouts, dividends or coupons, are made before corporation tax has been deducted. Based on what I just thought, dividends are paid after tax, so this wouldn't be true for equity. As for bonds, since interest is tax-deductible, it's almost like they're paid before tax because the company gets a tax benefit by paying interest. So, this seems true for bonds but not for equity. Therefore, option C is not the correct answer because it's supposed to be true for equity but not bonds, but in reality, it's the opposite.\n\nOption D says they can be traded on the secondary market. Both equity and bonds can be traded on secondary markets. Stocks are traded on stock exchanges, and bonds are traded in bond markets. So, this is true for both equity and bonds, making it not the correct answer for the question.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option B seems to be the correct answer. Dividends are paid after corporation tax has been deducted, whereas bond coupons are effectively paid before tax because they reduce taxable income. Therefore, option B is true for equity but not for bonds.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this. In terms of tax deductibility, interest expenses on bonds are deductible for the issuer, reducing their taxable income, whereas dividend payments are not deductible; they are paid from after-tax profits. So, yes, dividends are indeed paid after tax, and bond coupons are paid before tax in the sense that they reduce the tax liability. Therefore, option B is correctly stating that dividends are paid after tax, which applies to equity but not to bonds.\n\nSo, the answer should be option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
