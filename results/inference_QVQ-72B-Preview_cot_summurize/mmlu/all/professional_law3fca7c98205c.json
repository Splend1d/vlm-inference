In that year, the conservationist conveyed the tract \"to my nephew in fee simple, provided, however, that the grantee agrees that neither he nor his heirs or assigns shall ever use the property for any commercial purpose. If any portion of said tract is used for other than residential purposes, then the grantor or his successors in interest may re-enter as of the grantor's former estate. \" This deed was properly recorded. The nephew died intestate in 1999, survived by his wife. The conservationist died in 2002, survived by his two daughters, his only heirs. During the period between 1981 and 2007, the spreading development from a nearby city began to engulf the tract. Though still undeveloped, the tract became surrounded by office buildings, shopping malls, and other commercial edifices. In 2009, the wife executed and delivered to a developer a fee simple conveyance of the tract, which the developer immediately recorded. The deed did not contain any reference to the restriction noted above. After the developer acquired title to the tract, he commenced construction of a hotel complex on a portion of the tract that bordered an apartment building. The applicable recording statute in effect in this jurisdiction provides, in part, \"No deed or other instrument in writing, not recorded in accordance with this statute, shall affect the title or rights to, in any real estate, or any devisee or purchaser in good faith, without knowledge of the existence of such unrecorded instruments. \"If one of the daughters brings suit to enjoin the developer from constructing the hotel, the plaintiff will most likely\n\nA. win, because either daughter's right to the tract vested immediately upon the developer's construction of the hotel complex.\nB. win, because either daughter has the right of re-entry for condition broken.\nC. win, because the daughters, as the conservationist's only heirs, received a valid possibility of reverter from their father.\nD. lose, because a common development scheme had been established for the entire tract.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this property law scenario here, and I need to figure out whether one of the daughters can successfully sue to stop the developer from building a hotel on the land. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, in 1981, there was a conservationist who owned a 100-acre tract of land. He gave it to his nephew \"in fee simple,\" but with a condition: the land can't be used for any commercial purpose. If it is used for anything other than residential purposes, the conservationist or his successors can reclaim the property.\n\nOkay, so this is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. That means the nephew gets full ownership, but if he violates the condition about not using the land for commercial purposes, the conservationist or his heirs can take it back.\n\nThe deed was properly recorded, which is important for notice to future buyers.\n\nIn 1999, the nephew dies intestate, and his wife inherits the property. The conservationist dies in 2002, and his two daughters are his only heirs.\n\nBetween 1981 and 2007, the area around the tract develops a lot, with offices, shopping malls, and other commercial buildings popping up, surrounding the tract.\n\nIn 2009, the wife sells the tract to a developer without mentioning the restriction about no commercial use. The developer records the deed and starts building a hotel.\n\nNow, one of the daughters wants to sue to stop the hotel construction. The question is, will she likely win?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Win, because either daughter's right to the tract vested immediately upon the developer's construction of the hotel complex.\n\nB. Win, because either daughter has the right of re-entry for condition broken.\n\nC. Win, because the daughters, as the conservationist's only heirs, received a valid possibility of reverter from their father.\n\nD. Lose, because a common development scheme had been established for the entire tract.\n\nAlright, let's analyze each option.\n\nStarting with A: does the daughter's right to the tract vest immediately upon the developer's construction?\n\nWell, the conservationist gave the land to the nephew \"in fee simple,\" but with a condition subsequent. So, the nephew had full ownership unless he violated the condition.\n\nWhen the nephew died, his wife inherited, and she then sold to the developer.\n\nThe condition was that the land shouldn't be used for commercial purposes. The developer is building a hotel, which is commercial use, so the condition is violated.\n\nThe conservationist died in 2002, and his daughters are his heirs. So, they would be the ones who could enforce the condition subsequent.\n\nBut does their right vest immediately upon construction? I'm not sure. Maybe not immediately upon construction, but upon the violation of the condition.\n\nOption B: the daughter has the right of re-entry for condition broken.\n\nYes, that sounds right. In a condition subsequent, if the condition is violated, the grantor or their heirs have the right to re-enter and reclaim the property.\n\nSo, since the developer is building a hotel, which violates the no-commercial-use condition, the daughters, as the conservationist's heirs, have the right to re-enter and take back the property.\n\nOption C: the daughters received a valid possibility of reverter from their father.\n\nHmm, possibility of reverter usually refers to a situation where the grantor retains the right to have the property revert back under certain conditions, like in a fee simple determinable.\n\nBut in this case, the conservationist gave the land \"in fee simple,\" with a condition subsequent. So, it's a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, not a fee simple determinable.\n\nIn a condition subsequent, the conservationist didn't retain a possibility of reverter; instead, he created a right for himself or his heirs to re-enter if the condition was violated.\n\nSo, option C might not be accurate because it's referring to a possibility of reverter, which isn't the case here.\n\nOption D: the daughter loses because a common development scheme had been established for the entire tract.\n\nWhat does that mean? A common development scheme might refer to a planned unit development or some sort of unified planning for the area.\n\nBut in this case, the restriction is on the use of this specific tract, not on the surrounding area.\n\nEven if the surrounding area is developed commercially, that doesn't necessarily affect the restriction on this particular tract.\n\nSo, I don't think that's a strong argument against the daughter's claim.\n\nNow, between options A, B, and C, I think B is the most accurate.\n\nOption A talks about the right vesting immediately upon construction, but it's more about the violation of the condition triggering the right to re-enter.\n\nOption C refers to a possibility of reverter, which isn't applicable here because it's a condition subsequent, not a determinable fee.\n\nTherefore, option B seems correct: the daughter can win because she has the right of re-entry for condition broken.\n\nBut wait, there's more to consider.\n\nThe wife sold the tract to the developer in 2009, and the developer recorded the deed without mentioning the restriction.\n\nThere's a recording statute that says an unrecorded instrument doesn't affect the title or rights to real estate against a purchaser in good faith without knowledge of the existence of such unrecorded instruments.\n\nSo, the original deed with the restriction was recorded in 1981.\n\nThe wife sold to the developer in 2009 without mentioning the restriction.\n\nIf the developer didn't know about the restriction, and the restriction was recorded, then the developer should have known about it, assuming it was properly recorded and indexed.\n\nIf the restriction was properly recorded, then it's part of the public record, and the developer is charged with constructive notice of it.\n\nTherefore, the developer isn't a bona fide purchaser without knowledge of the restriction.\n\nSo, the restriction should still be enforceable against the developer.\n\nTherefore, when the daughter sues to enjoin the construction of the hotel, she should be able to enforce the condition subsequent and stop the construction.\n\nSo, the answer is B: win, because either daughter has the right of re-entry for condition broken.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any chance that the restriction could be unenforceable against the developer?\n\nWell, the recording statute says that an unrecorded instrument doesn't affect the title against a purchaser in good faith without knowledge.\n\nBut in this case, the restriction was recorded in 1981, so it should be part of the public record.\n\nAssuming the developer did a title search, they should have found the restriction.\n\nIf they didn't find it, maybe there was an error in the title search, but that's their problem.\n\nSo, the developer is charged with constructive notice of the restriction, and therefore isn't a bona fide purchaser without knowledge.\n\nTherefore, the restriction should still be enforceable against the developer.\n\nTherefore, the daughter should be able to enforce the condition subsequent and stop the construction.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
