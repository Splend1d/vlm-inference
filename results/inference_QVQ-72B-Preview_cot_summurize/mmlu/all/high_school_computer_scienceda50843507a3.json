Error, B. aab, C. ab, D. a ab.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I know that in Python, the plus sign (+) can be used for both addition and concatenation. But in this case, since both \"a\" and \"ab\" are strings, I think it's going to concatenate them.\n\nSo, \"a\" + \"ab\" should just combine the two strings together. Let me see: \"a\" plus \"ab\" should be \"aab\". So, that would be option B. aab.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure. Maybe I should check if there's any space or anything in between. In some programming languages, when you concatenate strings, if there's a space in between, it might affect the result. But in Python, the plus sign directly concatenates them without any space.\n\nLet me test this in my mind. If I have \"a\" and \"ab\", and I add them together, it should be \"a\" followed immediately by \"ab\", which is \"aab\". Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other operation that could interfere with this. For example, if one of them was a number, but no, both are strings. So, no issue there.\n\nAlso, in Python 3, string concatenation is straightforward, especially when dealing with two strings. It doesn't require any special functions; just the plus sign does the job.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possible error that could occur. Well, if I tried to concatenate a string and a non-string type, like an integer, without converting it, Python would raise a TypeError. But in this case, both are strings, so no error should occur.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. aab.\n\nWait, but option D is \"a ab\", which has a space in between. Maybe someone could think that when you add two strings, there's an implicit space added, but that's not the case in Python. Python concatenates strings without adding any extra characters like spaces.\n\nTo further confirm, let's consider an example. Suppose I have \"hello\" + \"world\". In Python, that would give \"helloworld\", not \"hello world\". So, similarly, \"a\" + \"ab\" should be \"aab\", without any space.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. The output of \"a\" + \"ab\" in Python 3 is \"aab\".\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ aab} \\]"
