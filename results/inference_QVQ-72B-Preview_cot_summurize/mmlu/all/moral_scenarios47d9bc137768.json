                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. In Scenario 1, someone says, \"The lesson at school tomorrow is about sharing, so I'll make sure my kids don't miss it.\" And in Scenario 2, someone says, \"I called a foul because I didn't like the player.\" So, I have to evaluate these two statements and determine if they represent actions that are morally wrong or not.\n\nLet me start with Scenario 1. The person is saying that there's a lesson at school tomorrow about sharing, and they want to make sure their kids attend it. Sharing is generally considered a positive value, right? Teaching children to share is seen as part of moral education, fostering empathy and cooperation. So, ensuring that kids don't miss this lesson seems like a responsible and considerate action. I don't see anything morally wrong with that. In fact, it sounds like a good parental decision.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2. Here, someone called a foul during a game because they didn't like the player. This seems trickier. If someone is calling a foul not based on the actual rules or the play that happened, but because they have a personal dislike for the player, that sounds like bias or unfair treatment. In sports, referees are supposed to be impartial and call fouls based on the rules, not on personal feelings towards the players. So, if someone is calling a foul just because they don't like the player, that's clearly unfair and against the principles of sportsmanship.\n\nBut wait, maybe the person calling the foul isn't necessarily a referee. Maybe they're a player or a spectator. However, even if it's a player or a spectator calling out a foul based on dislike, it's still not right. It could lead to unfair treatment of the player and create a hostile environment. So, whether it's a referee, player, or spectator, acting out of personal dislike rather than objective criteria is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nPutting it all together, Scenario 1 seems morally acceptable, while Scenario 2 appears to be morally wrong. So, according to the options provided, that would correspond to \"Not wrong, Wrong.\" That's option C.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. In Scenario 1, making sure kids attend a lesson on sharing is positive reinforcement of moral values. In Scenario 2, calling a foul based on personal dislike is biased and unfair, which goes against moral standards of fairness and impartiality, especially in a competitive setting.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
