The options are Zen Buddhism, Chan Buddhism, Humanistic Buddhism, and Pure Land Buddhism. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that Buddhism has many different schools and traditions, each with their own emphasis and practices. I should probably start by understanding what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with Zen Buddhism, I recall that Zen is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that originated in China and later spread to Japan. It's famous for its emphasis on meditation and direct experience over theoretical knowledge. Zen practitioners often use koans and meditation techniques to attain enlightenment. But in terms of social engagement, I'm not sure. I think Zen has had influences on art, culture, and even martial arts, but I don't know how much it specifically focuses on social engagement or attracting laypeople.\n\nNext is Chan Buddhism. Actually, I think Chan is the Chinese form of Zen. The name changes depending on the language: Zen in Japanese, Chan in Chinese. So, similar to Zen, it emphasizes meditation and personal insight. Again, not sure about its focus on social engagement.\n\nHumanistic Buddhism sounds interesting. The term \"humanistic\" suggests a focus on human concerns and perhaps an emphasis on improving society. I did a quick search in my mind and recalled that some Buddhist movements emphasize engagement with social issues, promoting peace, equality, and compassion in the world. Maybe this is the one that's more involved in community service, education, and other social programs that would attract laypeople.\n\nThen there's Pure Land Buddhism. I know that Pure Land is a devotional school of Buddhism, particularly popular in East Asia. It focuses on faith in Amitabha Buddha and the aspiration to be reborn in his Pure Land, where one can attain enlightenment more easily. It's known for its simple practices, like reciting the name of Amitabha Buddha, which can be done by anyone, including laypeople. So, it seems quite accessible to laypersons, but again, I'm not sure about its emphasis on social engagement.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider the primary activities of each tradition. Zen and Chan are more about meditation and personal enlightenment, though they do have lay followers. Pure Land is more about faith and devotional practices, also with a strong lay following. Humanistic Buddhism, as the name suggests, seems to place a greater emphasis on applying Buddhist principles to everyday life and society.\n\nI found a definition that says Humanistic Buddhism is a movement that emphasizes the importance of Buddhism in the context of human life and society. It advocates for the application of Buddhist teachings to solve contemporary social problems and encourages Buddhists to engage actively in the world to help others. This sounds very much aligned with social engagement and would likely attract lay participation since it involves people in community service and other outreach activities.\n\nComparatively, Zen and Chan are more inward-focused through meditation, while Pure Land is focused on devotional practices and rebirth in the Pure Land. Both have their values, but they don't seem to prioritize social engagement in the same way that Humanistic Buddhism does.\n\nAnother thought: some famous Buddhist organizations that are very active in social work and education, like the Fo Guang Shan or the Tzu Chi Foundation, are associated with Humanistic Buddhism. They are known for their extensive community service, disaster relief, and educational programs, which align perfectly with social engagement and lay participation.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that Humanistic Buddhism is the form that focuses on social engagement and attracts a lot of lay participation.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any possibility that Pure Land Buddhism also emphasizes social engagement? While Pure Land is known for its devotional practices, perhaps some branches or organizations within Pure Land also engage in social work. For example, some Pure Land temples might organize charity events or community services. However, from what I understand, social engagement isn't the primary focus of Pure Land Buddhism; rather, it's more about personal faith and aspiration for rebirth in the Pure Land.\n\nSimilarly, Zen and Chan are primarily about meditation and insight into the nature of reality. While these practices can inspire individuals to engage in social causes, the traditions themselves are more centered on individual spiritual development.\n\nIn contrast, Humanistic Buddhism explicitly integrates social engagement as part of its core mission. It sees Buddhism as a living tradition that should actively contribute to the betterment of society. Therefore, it's designed to be highly relevant to the lives of laypeople and encourages them to participate in various social and community activities.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. Humanistic Buddhism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
