                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this logic puzzle here. The question is about a type of fallacy where someone argues that a claim must be true because there's no evidence that it's false. And I need to match this description with one of the options provided: a priori, extension, appeal to ignorance, or plurium interrogationum.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a fallacy is. A fallacy is a flaw in reasoning, often used mistakenly in arguments to make a point seem more valid than it really is. So, in this case, the argument is that something must be true just because there's no proof it's not true. That seems fishy to me, but I need to see why it's a fallacy and what kind of fallacy it is.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A is \"a priori.\" I remember from philosophy classes that \"a priori\" knowledge is knowledge that's independent of experience or evidence from the senses. It's more about knowing something based on reason alone, like mathematical truths or logical deductions. But in this case, the claim is being accepted as true based on the absence of evidence against it, which doesn't seem to fit with the definition of a priori knowledge. So, maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nOption B is \"extension.\" I'm a bit unsure about this one. In logic, \"extension\" refers to the set of things to which a term applies. For example, the extension of the term \"dog\" would be the set of all dogs. But I don't see how this relates to accepting a claim as true because there's no evidence against it. This seems like a stretch, so I'll probably eliminate this one too.\n\nOption C is \"appeal to ignorance.\" This sounds familiar. I think it's a fallacy where someone claims that a proposition is true because it hasn't been proven false, or vice versa. Let me double-check that. Yes, the appeal to ignorance, also known as argumentum ad ignorantiam, is a fallacy where someone asserts that a claim is true because it hasn't been proven false, or that a claim is false because it hasn't been proven true. It's essentially using ignorance or lack of evidence as proof of something. That seems to match perfectly with the description in the question.\n\nOption D is \"plurium interrogationum.\" Hmm, I'm not as familiar with this term. Let me see if I can recall what it means. I think \"plurium interrogationum\" refers to asking multiple questions in one, which can be a tactic to confuse or complicate a discussion. It's more about the form of the question rather than the content of the argument. Given that, it doesn't seem to align with the scenario described in the question.\n\nSo, after considering each option, the one that fits the description of arguing that a claim must be true because there's no evidence that it's false is \"appeal to ignorance.\" Therefore, the correct answer should be C.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think of an example. Suppose someone says, \"There are aliens on Mars because no one has proven that there aren't.\" That's a classic case of appeal to ignorance. The person is using the absence of evidence against the existence of aliens on Mars as proof that they do exist. That's exactly the kind of reasoning the question is describing.\n\nYeah, I'm confident that appeal to ignorance is the correct choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
