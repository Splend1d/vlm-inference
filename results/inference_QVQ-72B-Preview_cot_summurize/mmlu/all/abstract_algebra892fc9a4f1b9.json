                    "text": "So I have this problem here: compute the product of (2,3) and (3,5) in the ring Z_5 x Z_9. I need to choose from options A through D, which are (1,1), (3,1), (1,6), and (3,6), respectively.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what it means to compute a product in the ring Z_5 x Z_9. I know that Z_n denotes the ring of integers modulo n, so Z_5 is integers modulo 5, and Z_9 is integers modulo 9. The direct product Z_5 x Z_9 combines these two rings component-wise.\n\nSo, elements of Z_5 x Z_9 are pairs where the first component is from Z_5 and the second from Z_9. To multiply two such elements, I should multiply their components separately, each in their respective ring.\n\nGiven that, I have (2,3) and (3,5). I need to compute (2,3) multiplied by (3,5).\n\nFirst, multiply the first components: 2 and 3 in Z_5.\n\n2 * 3 in Z_5 is 6, but since we're modulo 5, 6 is congruent to 1 modulo 5. So, the first component of the product is 1.\n\nNext, multiply the second components: 3 and 5 in Z_9.\n\n3 * 5 in Z_9 is 15, and 15 modulo 9 is 6. So, the second component of the product is 6.\n\nTherefore, the product should be (1,6), which corresponds to option C.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. In the direct product ring, operations are indeed performed component-wise, and each component is treated independently in its own ring.\n\nSo, for the first component: 2 * 3 in Z_5.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, and 6 mod 5 is 1. That seems correct.\n\nFor the second component: 3 * 5 in Z_9.\n\n3 * 5 = 15, and 15 mod 9 is 6. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, the product should be (1,6), which is option C.\n\nBut let me see if there's any other way to interpret this. Is there any possibility of a different operation being intended here? The problem says \"compute the product,\" which generally means multiplication, and in a ring, it's usually clear that it's multiplication unless specified otherwise.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there's any commutativity or other properties that might affect this, but in Z_5 and Z_9, multiplication is commutative, so that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nLet me see what the other options are:\n\nA. (1,1)\n\nB. (3,1)\n\nD. (3,6)\n\nNone of these match what I calculated. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the second component.\n\nWait, 3 * 5 in Z_9: 3 * 5 = 15, and 15 divided by 9 is 1 with a remainder of 6, so 15 \u2261 6 mod 9. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that Z_5 x Z_9 is isomorphic to Z_45 under certain conditions, but I don't think that's necessary here since we're just multiplying components separately.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the result in Z_5 x Z_9, but there might be a misinterpretation of the elements. Wait, no, it's clearly written as (2,3)(3,5) in Z_5 x Z_9.\n\nI think my calculation is correct, and the answer should be (1,6), which is option C.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other operation that could be intended by \"product.\" Could it be the cartesian product or something else? No, that doesn't make sense in this context. It's clearly multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's confusion about the rings involved. Z_5 is integers modulo 5, and Z_9 is integers modulo 9. Both are commutative rings with unity, and their direct product is also a commutative ring with unity.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is (1,6), option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
