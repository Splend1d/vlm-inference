                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out when Greek philosophers started moving away from the idea of gods being like humans in their behaviors and appearances. This is about rejecting the anthropomorphic view of the divine. The options are:\n\nA. Early Third Century BCE\n\nB. Second and First Century BCE\n\nC. Late Sixth Century BCE\n\nD. Fourth and Third Century BCE\n\nFirst, I need to understand what anthropomorphic means. It's the idea of attributing human characteristics to non-human entities, in this case, gods. So, Greek mythology is full of gods who have human-like forms and emotions\u2014they get angry, fall in love, plot against each other, etc. But at some point, philosophers began to question this view and sought a more abstract or less human-like conception of the divine.\n\nI need to recall when this shift happened. Let's think about the timeline of Greek philosophy.\n\nIn the sixth century BCE, we have philosophers like Thales, Anaximander, and Heraclitus, who were more concerned with natural philosophy and the material world. They weren't directly challenging the anthropomorphic gods of Olympus.\n\nIn the fifth century BCE, Socrates came along, but he still believed in the gods, though he might have had a more ethical approach to them. Plato, in the fourth century BCE, had more abstract ideas about the Forms, which could be seen as a move away from anthropomorphic deities, but he still believed in a kind of divine realm.\n\nAristotle, in the late fourth century BCE, also moved towards a more rational understanding of the world, including the idea of a \"prime mover\" that was pure thought and not anthropomorphic.\n\nSo, if I consider Plato and Aristotle, that puts me in the fourth and third centuries BCE.\n\nBut let's check about the Early Third Century BCE. That would be around the Hellenistic period, when philosophers like Epicurus and Zeno of Citium were active. Epicurus was an atomist and somewhat of a skeptic about the gods, while Zeno founded Stoicism, which had its own views on divinity, but not necessarily rejecting anthropomorphism entirely.\n\nThe Second and First Centuries BCE were times when Stoicism and Epicureanism were popular, but again, I'm not sure if they completely rejected anthropomorphic views of the divine.\n\nThe Late Sixth Century BCE would be around the time of the early Greek philosophers I mentioned earlier, who were more focused on nature and less on theology.\n\nSo, going back to Plato and Aristotle in the fourth and third centuries BCE, it seems that they began to shift the conception of the divine away from human-like forms and emotions.\n\nPlato's idea of the Forms or Ideas, which are perfect, unchanging abstractions, is quite different from the Olympian gods. His concept of the Good, which is the highest Form, is more of an abstract principle than a personal god.\n\nAristotle's notion of the Unmoved Mover, which is pure thought and the ultimate cause of all motion in the universe, is also highly abstract and not anthropomorphic.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the major shift away from anthropomorphic views of the divine occurred in the fourth and third centuries BCE, during the time of Plato and Aristotle.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Fourth and Third Century BCE.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
