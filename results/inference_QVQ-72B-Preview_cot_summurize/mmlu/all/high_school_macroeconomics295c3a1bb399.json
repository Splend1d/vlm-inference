                    "text": "So I have this question about monetary policy, and I need to figure out which option is an example of expansionary monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. The options are:\n\nA. Increasing the discount rate\n\nB. Increasing the reserve ratio\n\nC. Buying Treasury securities from commercial banks\n\nD. Lowering income taxes\n\nFirst, I need to recall what expansionary monetary policy is. I know that monetary policy is used to manage the money supply and interest rates in an economy to achieve specific goals like stable prices, full employment, and sustainable economic growth. Expansionary monetary policy is aimed at increasing the money supply or decreasing interest rates to stimulate economic growth, especially during recessions or periods of low inflation.\n\nSo, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Increasing the discount rate. The discount rate is the interest rate the Federal Reserve charges banks for short-term loans. If the Fed increases the discount rate, it makes borrowing more expensive for banks, which might lead them to borrow less from the Fed. This could result in less lending to individuals and businesses, which would reduce spending and slow down the economy. That sounds like contractionary monetary policy, not expansionary.\n\nOption B: Increasing the reserve ratio. The reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that banks are required to hold as reserves. If the Fed increases this ratio, banks have to hold more money in reserve and have less to lend out. This reduces the money supply in the economy, which is again contractionary. So, this doesn't seem like an expansionary policy either.\n\nOption C: Buying Treasury securities from commercial banks. This sounds familiar. I think when the Fed buys Treasury securities from banks, it injects money into the banking system. Here's how I understand it: when the Fed buys these securities, it pays for them by crediting the banks' reserve accounts. This increases the banks' reserves, allowing them to lend more money. More lending means more money in circulation, which should stimulate spending and investment. That sounds like expansionary monetary policy.\n\nOption D: Lowering income taxes. This seems different because it's about fiscal policy, not monetary policy. The Federal Reserve deals with monetary policy, while taxes are part of fiscal policy, which is handled by the legislative and executive branches of the government. Lowering income taxes would increase consumers' disposable income, potentially leading to increased spending, but this isn't a tool of the Fed.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option C seems to be the correct answer. Buying Treasury securities from commercial banks is a way for the Fed to increase the money supply and stimulate the economy, which is the goal of expansionary monetary policy.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check a couple of points. First, when the Fed buys Treasury securities, it's essentially pumping money into the banking system, which should lead to lower interest rates and increased borrowing and spending. Yes, that aligns with the objectives of expansionary policy.\n\nSecond, I should confirm that the other options are indeed not examples of expansionary monetary policy. Increasing the discount rate and increasing the reserve ratio both tend to reduce the money supply or make borrowing more expensive, which is contractionary. And lowering income taxes is a fiscal policy tool, not monetary policy, and is not directly related to the Fed's actions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Buying Treasury securities from commercial banks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
