                    "text": "So I have this problem here: the region bounded by the x-axis and the function f(x) = x/(1 + x^3) is rotated about the x-axis, and I need to find the volume of the solid generated. The options are \u03c0/3, \u03c0/4, \u03c0, and 2\u03c0.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the volume of a solid of revolution. Since the region is being rotated around the x-axis, I think the disk method is appropriate here. The disk method involves integrating the area of infinitesimally thin disks that make up the solid.\n\nThe formula for the volume using the disk method is:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi \\int_{a}^{b} [f(x)]^2 \\, dx \\]\n\nwhere a and b are the limits of integration, which correspond to the x-values where the region is bounded by the x-axis and the function.\n\nSo, in this case, f(x) = x/(1 + x^3), and I need to find the volume when this function is rotated around the x-axis.\n\nBut wait, I need to figure out the limits of integration. The problem says \"the region bounded by the x-axis and the function f(x) = x/(1 + x^3)\", but it doesn't specify the exact bounds. Maybe I need to find where f(x) intersects the x-axis.\n\nLet's see: f(x) = x/(1 + x^3)\n\nTo find where it intersects the x-axis, set f(x) = 0.\n\nSo, x/(1 + x^3) = 0\n\nThis implies x = 0, since the denominator can't be zero unless x^3 = -1, which would be x = -1.\n\nWait, x^3 + 1 = 0 => x = -1.\n\nSo, f(x) intersects the x-axis at x = 0 and x = -1.\n\nBut the problem likely considers positive x, since rotating negative x might involve different considerations. Maybe it's symmetric, or perhaps it's only considering x \u2265 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should consider both cases: rotating from x = -1 to x = 0, and from x = 0 to some positive value.\n\nBut the problem says \"the region bounded by the x-axis and the function f(x)\", without specifying the interval. Maybe it's assuming a standard interval where the function is non-negative or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's considering the entire region where f(x) is above the x-axis.\n\nLet me plot f(x) = x/(1 + x^3) to get a better idea.\n\nFor x < -1, x^3 + 1 = (x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1), which is zero at x = -1.\n\nFor x > -1, x^3 + 1 > 0.\n\nSo, f(x) is positive for x > -1, except at x = 0 where it's zero.\n\nWait, but x/(1 + x^3) at x = -1 is undefined because the denominator is zero.\n\nSo, f(x) is positive for x > -1, except at x = -1 where it's undefined.\n\nTherefore, the region bounded by the x-axis and f(x) would be from x = -1 to x approaches -1 from the right, and from x = 0 to some positive x where f(x) intersects the x-axis again.\n\nBut looking at f(x), as x increases beyond -1, f(x) increases from negative to positive.\n\nWait, no: f(x) = x/(1 + x^3)\n\nAt x = -1, denominator is zero, numerator is -1.\n\nAs x approaches -1 from the left, x^3 approaches -1, so denominator approaches zero from the negative side, since x^3 + 1 < 0 for x < -1.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the problem assumes rotating from x = 0 to some positive x where f(x) intersects the x-axis again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's considering the entire region where f(x) is above the x-axis.\n\nI think I need to consider the interval where f(x) is non-negative.\n\nLet's find where f(x) is above the x-axis.\n\nf(x) = x/(1 + x^3)\n\nFor f(x) > 0, we need x and 1 + x^3 to have the same sign.\n\nSo, 1 + x^3 > 0 when x > -1, and 1 + x^3 < 0 when x < -1.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- For x > -1, 1 + x^3 > 0, and x > 0, so f(x) > 0 for x > 0.\n\n- For x < -1, 1 + x^3 < 0, and x < 0, so f(x) > 0.\n\n- At x = -1, denominator is zero, undefined.\n\n- At x = 0, f(x) = 0.\n\nSo, f(x) is above the x-axis for x > 0.\n\nWait, but for x < -1, both numerator and denominator are negative, so f(x) is positive there.\n\nBut the problem likely considers only x \u2265 0, as rotating negative x might involve different considerations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's considering the entire real line except x = -1.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should assume the region is from x = 0 to some positive x where f(x) intersects the x-axis again.\n\nLooking at f(x) = x/(1 + x^3), let's see where f(x) = 0.\n\nf(x) = 0 when x = 0, and approaches 0 as x approaches infinity.\n\nSo, perhaps the bounded region is from x = 0 to x approaches infinity, but that wouldn't make sense for a bounded region.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's from x = 0 to x = some value where f(x) intersects the x-axis again, but f(x) only intersects at x = 0.\n\nWait, maybe it's from x = 0 to x = 1.\n\nLet's check f(1) = 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2, which is positive.\n\nf(x) is positive for x > 0, and approaches 0 as x approaches infinity.\n\nSo, perhaps the bounded region is from x = 0 to x = some value where f(x) is still above the x-axis.\n\nBut without a specific interval, it's hard to determine the limits of integration.\n\nMaybe I should assume the region is from x = 0 to x = some value, say x = 1, and see if the volume matches one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to find the volume from x = 0 to x = infinity, but that seems unlikely since the integral would diverge.\n\nWait, no: as x approaches infinity, f(x) approaches 0, so the integral might converge.\n\nLet me consider that possibility.\n\nCompute the volume V = \u03c0 * integral from 0 to infinity of [x/(1 + x^3)]^2 dx.\n\nBut that seems complicated, and maybe not what the problem intends.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the region is from x = 0 to x = 1.\n\nLet's compute V = \u03c0 * integral from 0 to 1 of [x/(1 + x^3)]^2 dx.\n\nBut that might not be the correct interval.\n\nAlternatively, maybe from x = 0 to x = 2.\n\nI need to find the correct interval.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire area where f(x) is above the x-axis, which is from x = 0 to infinity.\n\nBut that seems unlikely for a multiple-choice question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's from x = 0 to x = 1.\n\nLet me try computing V = \u03c0 * integral from 0 to 1 of [x/(1 + x^3)]^2 dx.\n\nFirst, simplify [x/(1 + x^3)]^2 = x^2 / (1 + 2x^3 + x^6).\n\nThis still looks complicated to integrate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can use the substitution method to simplify the integral.\n\nLet me set u = 1 + x^3, then du/dx = 3x^2, so dx = du/(3x^2).\n\nBut then the integral becomes \u03c0 * integral of [x / u]^2 * du/(3x^2) = \u03c0/3 * integral of x^2 / (u^2 x^2) du = \u03c0/3 * integral of 1/u^2 du.\n\nWait, that seems promising.\n\nIf u = 1 + x^3, then du = 3x^2 dx, so dx = du/(3x^2).\n\nThen, [x / (1 + x^3)]^2 = x^2 / (1 + x^3)^2 = x^2 / u^2.\n\nSo, V = \u03c0 * integral of [x^2 / u^2] * [du/(3x^2)] = \u03c0/3 * integral of 1/u^2 du.\n\nThat's much simpler.\n\nNow, integral of 1/u^2 du = integral of u^{-2} du = -1/u + C.\n\nSo, V = \u03c0/3 * (-1/u) evaluated from a to b.\n\nBut what are the limits of integration?\n\nIf I assume the region is from x = 0 to x = some value, say x = 1, then u changes from u = 1 + 0^3 = 1 to u = 1 + 1^3 = 2.\n\nSo, V = \u03c0/3 * [ -1/u ] from 1 to 2 = \u03c0/3 * [ -1/2 - (-1/1) ] = \u03c0/3 * [ -1/2 + 1 ] = \u03c0/3 * [1/2] = \u03c0/6.\n\nBut \u03c0/6 is not one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the limits are from x = 0 to x = infinity.\n\nThen, u goes from 1 to infinity.\n\nV = \u03c0/3 * [ -1/infinity - (-1/1) ] = \u03c0/3 * [0 + 1] = \u03c0/3.\n\nThat's one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe from x = 0 to x = 1, which gave \u03c0/6, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe from x = 0 to x = 2.\n\nThen, u goes from 1 to 1 + 8 = 9.\n\nV = \u03c0/3 * [ -1/9 - (-1/1) ] = \u03c0/3 * [ -1/9 + 1 ] = \u03c0/3 * [8/9] = 8\u03c0/27.\n\nNot an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe from x = 0 to x = some other value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the region is from x = 0 to x = infinity, giving V = \u03c0/3.\n\nThat seems plausible.\n\nBut let's check if the integral converges.\n\nConsider the integral from 0 to infinity of [x / (1 + x^3)]^2 dx.\n\nLet's see the behavior as x approaches infinity.\n\n[x / (1 + x^3)]^2 ~ [x / x^3]^2 = [1 / x^2]^2 = 1 / x^4.\n\nThe integral from 1 to infinity of 1/x^4 dx converges, since it's a p-integral with p = 4 > 1.\n\nSimilarly, near x = 0, [x / (1 + x^3)]^2 approaches 0, so it's okay there too.\n\nTherefore, the integral from 0 to infinity of [x / (1 + x^3)]^2 dx is finite.\n\nThus, V = \u03c0/3 is a possible answer.\n\nBut let's see if there are other possible intervals that could give one of the other options.\n\nFor example, from x = 0 to x = sqrt(2).\n\nWait, that doesn't seem helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe from x = 0 to x = 1.\n\nWe already saw that gives \u03c0/6, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, from x = 0 to x = 2, which gave 8\u03c0/27, not an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe from x = 0 to x = some other value that gives \u03c0/4 or \u03c0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the region is from x = 0 to x = 1, and I made a mistake in calculating V.\n\nWait, let's recalculate V for x from 0 to 1.\n\nu = 1 + x^3, du = 3x^2 dx.\n\nThen, [x / (1 + x^3)]^2 = x^2 / (1 + x^3)^2.\n\nV = \u03c0 * integral from 0 to 1 of x^2 / (1 + x^3)^2 dx.\n\nSubstitute u = 1 + x^3, then du = 3x^2 dx, dx = du/(3x^2).\n\nWait, but x^2 is in the numerator, so dx = du/(3x^2).\n\nBut x^2 is already in the numerator, so it cancels out.\n\nThus, V = \u03c0/3 * integral of 1/u^2 du from u=1 to u=2.\n\nIntegral of 1/u^2 du = -1/u.\n\nSo, V = \u03c0/3 * [ -1/2 - (-1/1) ] = \u03c0/3 * [ -1/2 + 1 ] = \u03c0/3 * [1/2] = \u03c0/6.\n\nBut \u03c0/6 isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the region is from x = 0 to x = infinity, giving V = \u03c0/3.\n\nThat seems to be the only option that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider only positive x, so from x = 0 to infinity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the region is symmetric, and I need to consider both positive and negative x.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as rotating negative x might involve different considerations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering only x \u2265 0, and rotating that region.\n\nIn that case, V = \u03c0/3 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to find the volume.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the shell method instead of the disk method.\n\nThe shell method involves integrating the surface area of cylindrical shells.\n\nThe formula for the shell method is:\n\n\\[ V = 2\\pi \\int_{a}^{b} x f(x) \\, dx \\]\n\nBut in this case, since the function is being rotated around the x-axis, the disk method seems more appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both methods can be used, but the disk method seems more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the substitution method again to simplify the integral.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a geometric interpretation that can simplify the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for symmetry in the function to simplify the integral.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider partial fractions to decompose 1/(1 + x^3).\n\nWait, that might be a way to proceed.\n\nRecall that 1 + x^3 = (x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1).\n\nSo, 1/(1 + x^3) = 1/[(x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)].\n\nThen, [x / (1 + x^3)]^2 = x^2 / (1 + x^3)^2.\n\nThis seems complicated to integrate directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the substitution method again.\n\nWait, earlier I used u = 1 + x^3, which simplified the integral to \u03c0/3 * integral of 1/u^2 du.\n\nAnd if I integrate from u = 1 to u = infinity, that gives \u03c0/3 * [ -1/u ] from 1 to infinity = \u03c0/3 * [0 - (-1)] = \u03c0/3 * 1 = \u03c0/3.\n\nWhich is one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider other intervals, like from x = 0 to x = some finite value, I get different results that aren't among the options.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the intended interval is from x = 0 to x = infinity, giving V = \u03c0/3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider only x \u2265 0, which would correspond to rotating the region from x = 0 to x = infinity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming the limits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the region is from x = 0 to x = 1, and I need to calculate V accordingly.\n\nLet me try that again.\n\nIf the region is from x = 0 to x = 1, then u goes from 1 to 2, as I did earlier, giving V = \u03c0/6, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the region is from x = 0 to x = some other value that gives V = \u03c0/4 or \u03c0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the entire area where f(x) is above the x-axis, which is from x = 0 to infinity.\n\nIn that case, V = \u03c0/3 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the volume is equal to \u03c0 times the integral of [f(x)]^2 dx from a to b.\n\nSo, V = \u03c0 * integral from 0 to infinity of [x / (1 + x^3)]^2 dx.\n\nUsing the substitution u = 1 + x^3, du = 3x^2 dx, dx = du/(3x^2).\n\nThen, [x / (1 + x^3)]^2 = x^2 / (1 + x^3)^2 = x^2 / u^2.\n\nSo, V = \u03c0 * integral of [x^2 / u^2] * [du/(3x^2)] = \u03c0/3 * integral of 1/u^2 du.\n\nIntegrating from u = 1 to u = infinity:\n\nV = \u03c0/3 * [ -1/u ] from 1 to infinity = \u03c0/3 * [0 - (-1)] = \u03c0/3 * 1 = \u03c0/3.\n\nTherefore, the volume is \u03c0/3.\n\nSo, the answer is A. \u03c0/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\dfrac{\\pi}{3}} \\]"
