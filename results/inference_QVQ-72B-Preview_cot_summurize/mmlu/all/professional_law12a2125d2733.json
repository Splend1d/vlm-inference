                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a freight company and a wholesale tire distributor. The freight company made an offer to buy a bunch of tires from the wholesaler, but before getting a response, the purchasing agent from the freight company called the wholesaler and said they're facing a critical financial crisis and can't afford to make the purchase. Then, the next day, the seller sent an acceptance form and shipped the goods with an invoice. But the purchasing company didn't pay and sent the goods back. Now, the seller is suing for lost profit, claiming that the purchasing agent's words weren't clear enough to revoke the offer.\n\nAlright, so first things first, I need to understand the contract law here, particularly regarding offer and acceptance, and how offers can be revoked.\n\nSo, in contract law, when one party makes an offer to another, that offer can be accepted or rejected. But sometimes, the offering party might want to revoke the offer before it's accepted. However, in this case, it's a bit different because the offer was made by the freight company to buy tires, and the wholesaler accepted by sending an acceptance form and shipping the goods.\n\nWait, but the purchasing agent called to say they can't afford to make the purchase due to a financial crisis before the acceptance was received. So, is that a revocation of the offer?\n\nLet me think about this. In contract law, an offer can be revoked any time before it's accepted, as long as the revocation is communicated to the offeree before they accept.\n\nSo, if the purchasing agent communicated to the wholesaler that they couldn't proceed with the purchase before the wholesaler accepted the offer, that might be a valid revocation.\n\nBut the seller claims that the purchasing agent's words weren't clear enough to communicate a revocation. They say, \"We are confronting a critical financial crisis and cannot afford to make the purchase.\"\n\nHmm, that seems pretty clear to me. Saying you can't afford to make the purchase sounds like you're backing out of the deal.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Perhaps there's some ambiguity in the statement that could affect its interpretation.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because a revocation of an offer requires explicit words of rejection in order to be enforced.\n\nB. Yes, because the seller must be able to rely on a definite order of goods.\n\nC. No, because the words of revocation were clear enough to communicate that the deal was off.\n\nD. No, because a buyer is never in breach of an agreement when it rejects goods prior to their shipment.\n\nOkay, so option A suggests that revocation needs explicit words of rejection. The purchasing agent's statement was pretty explicit: \"cannot afford to make the purchase.\" That sounds like a clear rejection to me.\n\nOption B says yes, because the seller must be able to rely on a definite order of goods. Well, generally, sellers do rely on orders, but in this case, the offer was revoked before acceptance, so maybe that's not entirely relevant.\n\nOption C says no, because the words were clear enough to communicate revocation. That aligns with my initial thought.\n\nOption D says no, because a buyer is never in breach when it rejects goods prior to shipment. But in this case, the seller already shipped the goods based on the original offer, and the buyer rejected the goods after the seller had accepted and shipped them.\n\nWait, but the buyer claimed they revoked the offer before the seller accepted. If that's the case, then there was no contract formed, and the buyer wouldn't be in breach by rejecting the goods.\n\nBut the seller is arguing that the revocation wasn't clear, so the acceptance was valid, and therefore the buyer is in breach for rejecting the goods.\n\nSo, the crux of the matter is whether the purchasing agent's statement effectively revoked the offer before the seller accepted it.\n\nLet me consider the communication aspect. The purchasing agent called the wholesaler to inform them of the financial crisis and inability to purchase before the acceptance was sent. So, presumably, the wholesaler received this communication before sending the acceptance.\n\nBut the seller claims that the words used weren't clear enough to constitute a revocation.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a difference between saying \"we can't afford to make the purchase\" and explicitly saying \"we revoke our offer to purchase the tires.\"\n\nPerhaps the purchasing agent didn't use the exact language of revocation, but conveyed that they couldn't proceed with the purchase due to financial difficulties.\n\nIn contract law, revocation needs to be communicated in a manner that clearly indicates the offeror's intention to no longer be bound by the offer.\n\n\"Saying 'we can't afford to make the purchase' could be interpreted as a statement of current financial capability rather than an intention to revoke the offer permanently.\n\nMaybe the purchasing agent should have said something like, \"we revoke our offer to purchase the tires due to our financial crisis.\"\n\nBut they didn't use those exact words. They just said they can't afford to make the purchase.\n\nSo, perhaps the seller interpreted this as a temporary issue and proceeded with the acceptance anyway, expecting that the financial crisis would pass or that the purchasing company would find a way to honor the purchase.\n\nFrom the seller's perspective, they might have relied on the original offer and proceeded with acceptance and shipment, despite the purchasing agent's statement.\n\nNow, considering that, the seller is suing for lost profit, claiming that the revocation wasn't clear enough.\n\nSo, the question is, were the purchasing agent's words sufficient to revoke the offer?\n\nOption A says yes, because revocation requires explicit words of rejection. But in this case, the seller is arguing that the words weren't explicit enough.\n\nOption B says yes, because the seller must rely on a definite order. But that seems to be more about the need for certainty in business transactions, which is understandable, but may not directly address the clarity of revocation.\n\nOption C says no, because the words were clear enough to communicate revocation. Which seems to align with my initial thought that saying \"we can't afford to make the purchase\" is pretty clear.\n\nOption D says no, because a buyer is never in breach when rejecting goods prior to shipment. But in this case, the goods were already shipped before the rejection, which complicates things.\n\nWait, the seller shipped the goods after the purchasing agent's statement but before any formal rejection from the buyer. So, the shipment was based on the original offer and the seller's acceptance, despite the purchasing agent's communication.\n\nIf the revocation was effective, then there was no contract, and the buyer wasn't obligated to accept the goods. Therefore, returning the goods wouldn't be a breach.\n\nBut the seller is claiming that the revocation wasn't effective because the words weren't clear enough, so the acceptance was valid, creating a contract, and the buyer breached by rejecting the goods and not paying.\n\nSo, the key is whether the revocation was effective.\n\nIn contract law, revocation must be clear and unequivocal. The offeree must be left in no doubt that the offeror intends to revoke the offer.\n\nIn this case, saying \"we can't afford to make the purchase\" could be seen as a statement of current financial incapacity rather than an intention to revoke the offer permanently.\n\nPerhaps the purchasing agent should have said, \"we revoke our offer to purchase the tires due to our financial crisis,\" or something to that effect.\n\nBut they didn't use those words. They just stated their financial\u56f0\u5883 and inability to make the purchase.\n\nSo, maybe the seller could argue that this was just a statement of current financial status and not a revocation of the offer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the purchasing agent's statement was clear enough to indicate that they were backing out of the deal.\n\nI can see both sides here.\n\nFrom the seller's perspective, they might have thought that the purchasing agent was facing temporary financial difficulties and still intended to honor the purchase, perhaps expecting that the financial crisis would be resolved soon.\n\nFrom the buyer's perspective, they clearly stated they couldn't afford to make the purchase, which seems like a definitive statement of inability to proceed.\n\nBut in contract law, the intention must be clear. If the offeree reasonably believes that the offer is still open, then the acceptance is valid.\n\nSo, if the seller reasonably believed that the offer was still open despite the purchasing agent's statement, then their acceptance would be valid, creating a contract, and the buyer would be in breach by rejecting the goods and not paying.\n\nOn the other hand, if the purchasing agent's statement was clear enough to indicate revocation, then there was no contract formed, and the buyer wasn't obligated to accept the goods.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is C: no, because the words of revocation were clear enough to communicate that the deal was off.\n\nSaying \"we can't afford to make the purchase\" is a pretty clear indication that they're backing out of the deal.\n\nTherefore, the seller wouldn't prevail in this case because the revocation was effective, and there was no contract formed.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption A says yes, because revocation requires explicit words of rejection. But in this case, the words used were \"we can't afford to make the purchase,\" which seems explicit enough.\n\nOption B says yes, because the seller must rely on a definite order. While that's true in general, it doesn't directly address the clarity of the revocation.\n\nOption D says no, because a buyer is never in breach when rejecting goods prior to shipment. But in this case, the goods were already shipped before the rejection, which might complicate things.\n\nHowever, if the revocation was effective, then there was no contract, and the buyer wasn't obligated to accept the goods even if they were already shipped.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is C: no, because the words of revocation were clear enough to communicate that the deal was off.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
