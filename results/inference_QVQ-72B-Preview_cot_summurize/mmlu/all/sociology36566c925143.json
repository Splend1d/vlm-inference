The options are:\n\nA. fixed-choice questions\n\nB. short questions\n\nC. leading questions\n\nD. funnelled questions\n\nHmm, let's think about this. I need to recall what makes a good survey question and what might make a question bad or biased.\n\nFirst off, I know that surveys are supposed to collect information in a way that's unbiased and allows respondents to answer honestly and freely. So, any question that steers people towards a particular answer or is unclear might be problematic.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\n**Option A: fixed-choice questions**\n\nFixed-choice questions are those where respondents have to choose from a set of predefined answers, like multiple-choice questions. These are pretty common in surveys because they're easy to analyze statistically. Plus, they can help ensure that all responses are comparable. So, I don't think these are generally avoided. In fact, they're often encouraged for their clarity and simplicity.\n\n**Option B: short questions**\n\nShort questions are, well, brief and to the point. Generally, keeping questions short can help prevent confusion and make the survey easier to complete. Long, rambling questions can lose people's attention or be harder to understand. So, again, I think short questions are usually preferred in surveys.\n\n**Option C: leading questions**\n\nNow, leading questions are ones that suggest a particular answer or bias the respondent in some way. For example, asking \"Don't you think that the new policy is a bad idea?\" implies that the policy is bad and tries to elicit a negative response. This kind of question is problematic because it may not reflect the respondent's true feelings and can skew the data. So, leading questions are definitely something to avoid in surveys for their bias.\n\n**Option D: funnelled questions**\n\nFunnelled questions are a sequence of questions that start broad and become more specific, kind of like a funnel. This technique is often used in surveys to help guide respondents into more detailed topics without overwhelming them. It's a method to refine responses and get more nuanced data. So, funnelled questions are actually a useful tool in survey design and not something to be avoided.\n\nPutting it all together, among the options provided, leading questions (Option C) are the ones that should be avoided in surveys. They introduce bias and can compromise the validity of the survey results.\n\nJust to double-check, let me consider if there's any context where one of the other options might also be considered something to avoid. For instance, maybe in certain situations, fixed-choice questions could be limiting if they don't capture the full range of possible responses. But generally, they're acceptable and widely used.\n\nSimilarly, short questions are usually better than long ones, as they're clearer and less likely to confuse respondents. And funnelled questions are a deliberate approach to guide respondents through complex topics, so they're also generally acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option C: leading questions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
