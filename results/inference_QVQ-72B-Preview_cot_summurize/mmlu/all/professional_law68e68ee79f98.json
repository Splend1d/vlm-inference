Shortly thereafter, while the purchaser was riding the bicycle along a city street, he saw a traffic light facing him turn from green to amber. He sped up, hoping to cross the intersection before the light turned red. However, the purchaser quickly realized that he could not do so and applied the brakes, which failed. To avoid the traffic that was then crossing in front of him, the purchaser turned sharply to his right and onto the sidewalk, where he struck a pedestrian. Both the pedestrian and the purchaser suffered injuries. The pedestrian asserted a claim based on negligence against the bicycle company. At trial, it was found that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect in the bicycle, and that the bicycle company failed to conduct a reasonable inspection that would have led to the discovery of the existence of the defect. Will the pedestrian prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the bicycle company placed a defective bicycle into the stream of commerce.\nB. Yes, because the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the bicycle company.\nC. No, because the pedestrian was not a purchaser of the bicycle.\nD. No, because the purchaser was negligent in turning onto the sidewalk.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this case here, and I need to figure out whether the pedestrian will prevail in their negligence claim against the bicycle company. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a bicycle company that manufactured a bike and sold it to a retailer, who then sold it to a purchaser. So, the bicycle company is the manufacturer, and the purchaser is the one who bought the bike from the retailer.\n\nShortly after buying the bike, the purchaser was riding it down a city street. He saw a traffic light change from green to amber and decided to speed up to make it across the intersection before it turned red. But he realized he couldn't make it in time, so he applied the brakes, which failed. To avoid oncoming traffic, he made a sharp right turn onto the sidewalk and ended up hitting a pedestrian. Both the pedestrian and the purchaser were injured.\n\nThe pedestrian is now suing the bicycle company for negligence because the brake failure was due to a manufacturing defect, and the bicycle company didn't do a reasonable inspection that would have caught this defect.\n\nOkay, so this seems like a product liability case, specifically involving negligence. In negligence claims, there are a few elements that need to be proven:\n\n1. **Duty of Care:** The defendant (the bicycle company) had a duty to manufacture a safe product.\n\n2. **Breach of Duty:** The bicycle company breached this duty by failing to conduct a reasonable inspection that would have revealed the manufacturing defect in the brakes.\n\n3. **Causation:** The defect in the brakes caused the accident, which in turn caused the pedestrian's injuries.\n\n4. **Damages:** The pedestrian suffered injuries and damages as a result of the accident.\n\nFrom what I can gather, it seems like all these elements might be present:\n\n- **Duty of Care:** Manufacturers have a duty to ensure their products are safe for use.\n\n- **Breach of Duty:** The bicycle company failed to conduct a reasonable inspection that would have found the defect.\n\n- **Causation:** The brake failure, due to the defect, led to the purchaser being unable to stop, which caused him to turn sharply and hit the pedestrian.\n\n- **Damages:** The pedestrian was injured.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because the bicycle company placed a defective bicycle into the stream of commerce.\n\nThis seems relevant because the company put a defective product on the market, which caused harm.\n\nB. Yes, because the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the bicycle company.\n\nThis also seems on point because the company failed to inspect the product properly, which led to the defect not being found.\n\nC. No, because the pedestrian was not a purchaser of the bicycle.\n\nThis might not hold up because in product liability cases, especially negligence claims, it's not always necessary to be the direct purchaser. Injuries to third parties can sometimes be compensated if the manufacturer was negligent.\n\nD. No, because the purchaser was negligent in turning onto the sidewalk.\n\nThis could be a possible defense, but it seems like the primary cause of the accident was the brake failure, not the purchaser's decision to turn onto the sidewalk. The purchaser turned to avoid oncoming traffic because his brakes failed, so his actions might be seen as a reaction to the brake failure.\n\nGiven all this, I think the pedestrian has a strong case for negligence against the bicycle company. The company had a duty to ensure the bike was safe, they failed to inspect it properly, which led to the defect not being found, and this defect caused the accident that injured the pedestrian.\n\nSo, I would say that the pedestrian will prevail, and the correct answer is either A or B. But between A and B, I think B is more precise because it directly refers to the company's failure to discover the defect through reasonable care, which is a key part of the negligence claim.\n\nOption A talks about placing a defective product into the stream of commerce, which is related but might be more associated with strict liability, which isn't the focus here since it's a negligence claim.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B: Yes, because the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the bicycle company.\n\nBut to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nIn negligence, the defendant is expected to exercise reasonable care in their actions. In manufacturing, this includes designing, producing, and inspecting the product to ensure it's safe. If the company fails to do so, and that failure leads to someone getting hurt, they can be held liable for negligence.\n\nIn this case, the company didn't conduct a reasonable inspection, which means they didn't exercise reasonable care, and as a result, a defect wasn't found, leading to the accident.\n\nOption A, while related, seems more aligned with strict liability arguments, where the manufacturer is liable simply because they sold a defective product that caused harm, regardless of whether they were negligent.\n\nBut in this scenario, since it's a negligence claim, proving that the company failed to exercise reasonable care is crucial. So, option B seems more appropriate.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the pedestrian doesn't have to be the purchaser to make a claim. In many jurisdictions, anyone who is injured due to a manufacturer's negligence can seek compensation.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because the purchaser's actions were a direct result of the brake failure. Even if he turned onto the sidewalk, the primary cause was the brakes not working, which was due to the manufacturing defect.\n\nTherefore, the pedestrian should prevail in this negligence claim against the bicycle company.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
