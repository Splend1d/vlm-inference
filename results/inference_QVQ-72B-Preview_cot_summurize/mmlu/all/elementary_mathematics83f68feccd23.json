                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question that asks which situation could be represented by the expression 6 times 2. Okay, so I need to look at each option and see which one matches multiplying 6 by 2.\n\nFirst option is A: Rocco hiked six miles each day for two days. Hmm, that sounds like he hiked 6 miles one day and 6 miles another day. So, total miles would be 6 plus 6, which is 12. That's like 6 times 2 equals 12. Wait, but is that the right way to think about it? Actually, yes, because 6 times 2 is indeed 12. So, this seems like a possible answer.\n\nNext is option B: Rocco had six baseballs and gave away two of them. So, if he had 6 and gave away 2, he should have 4 left. But 6 minus 2 is 4, which doesn't involve multiplication. It's subtraction, not multiplication. So, this doesn't match the expression 6 times 2.\n\nOption C: Rocco had a total of six tennis balls in two cans. Okay, so he has two cans, and together they hold 6 tennis balls. So, if each can has the same number, how many in each can? Well, 6 divided by 2 is 3, so each can has 3 tennis balls. But again, that's division, not multiplication. So, this doesn't match the expression 6 times 2.\n\nLastly, option D: Rocco biked six miles and then continued for two more miles. So, total miles biked would be 6 plus 2, which is 8. That's addition, not multiplication. So, again, this doesn't match the expression 6 times 2.\n\nSo, out of all these options, only option A involves multiplying 6 by 2 to get 12, which matches the expression 6 times 2.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In option A, it says he hiked six miles each day for two days. So, if he hiked 6 miles one day and 6 miles another day, the total is 12 miles. That is indeed 6 multiplied by 2. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nIn option B, if he had 6 baseballs and gave away 2, he has 4 left. That's 6 minus 2, which is subtraction, not multiplication.\n\nOption C, having 6 tennis balls in two cans, implies each can has 3 tennis balls, which is division (6 divided by 2 equals 3), not multiplication.\n\nAnd option D, biking 6 miles and then 2 more miles, that's just adding 6 and 2 to get 8, which is addition.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is option A: Rocco hiked six miles each day for two days.\n\nI think that's the answer. Good.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
