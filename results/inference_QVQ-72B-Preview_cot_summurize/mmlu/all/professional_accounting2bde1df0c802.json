So, Toft Co. has some common stock outstanding, issues more during the year, has some preferred stock out there too, and we've got net income. I need to find the EPS for the year.\n\nFirst things first, EPS is basically the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. The formula for basic EPS is net income minus any preferred dividends, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.\n\nSo, net income is $480,000. There are preferred stocks outstanding all year, 10,000 shares with a dividend of $5 per share. So, total preferred dividends would be 10,000 times $5, which is $50,000. So, the amount available for common shareholders is net income minus preferred dividends, which is $480,000 minus $50,000, equal to $430,000.\n\nNow, for the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. At the beginning of the year, there were 120,000 shares outstanding. Then, on April 1, they issued an additional 40,000 shares. Since the shares were issued on April 1, they were outstanding for the remaining part of the year, which is from April 1 to December 31. That's 9 months out of 12.\n\nTo calculate the weighted average, I need to consider the time each share was outstanding.\n\nSo, the initial 120,000 shares were outstanding for the entire year, which is 12 months. The additional 40,000 shares were outstanding for 9 months.\n\nThe weighted average number of common shares would be:\n\n(120,000 shares * 12 months) + (40,000 shares * 9 months), then divided by 12 months.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst part: 120,000 * 12 = 1,440,000\n\nSecond part: 40,000 * 9 = 360,000\n\nTotal weighted shares: 1,440,000 + 360,000 = 1,800,000\n\nNow, divide by 12 months to get the average: 1,800,000 / 12 = 150,000 shares\n\nSo, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding is 150,000.\n\nNow, EPS = Amount available to common shareholders / Weighted average number of common shares\n\nEPS = $430,000 / 150,000 shares\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n430,000 \u00f7 150,000 = 2.8666...\n\nSo, that's approximately $2.87 per share.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $2.69\n\nB. $2.87\n\nC. $3.00\n\nD. $3.20\n\nSo, option B. $2.87 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, some people might calculate the weighted average differently, but I think this method is standard.\n\nAnother way is to consider that the additional shares were outstanding for 9 months, so from April 1 to December 31, that's 9 months out of 12.\n\nSo, the weighted average would be:\n\nInitial shares: 120,000 * 12/12 = 120,000\n\nAdditional shares: 40,000 * 9/12 = 30,000\n\nTotal: 120,000 + 30,000 = 150,000\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the months in days or something, but no, since we're dealing with months, this should suffice.\n\nSo, yeah, $430,000 divided by 150,000 is indeed $2.8666..., which rounds to $2.87.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. $2.87.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 2.87} \\]"
