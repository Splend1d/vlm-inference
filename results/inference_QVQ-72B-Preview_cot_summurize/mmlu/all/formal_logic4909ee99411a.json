                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out the conclusion of this argument about utilitarian theory and utility monsters. The text is from Robert Nozick's \"Anarchy, State, and Utopia,\" and it's discussing a problem for utilitarianism. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, it says that utilitarian theory is embarrassed by the possibility of utility monsters. So, \"embarrassed\" here probably means that this concept presents a difficulty or challenge for the theory. Utilitarianism is the idea that the best action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or utility.\n\nThen, it defines a utility monster as someone who gets enormous gains in utility. More than that, these gains are greater than the utility lost by the sacrifices of others. So, even if many people have to make sacrifices, the total utility still increases because the monster's gain is so much bigger.\n\nThe argument seems to be that, according to utilitarian theory, it would be right to have these sacrifices because they lead to a greater total utility. But this seems problematic because it might require that a lot of people make significant sacrifices for the sake of one person's happiness.\n\nSo, the conclusion should be that utilitarian theory faces a significant issue with the concept of utility monsters, as it seems to require that many people be sacrificed for the sake of the monster's utility.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Utilitarian theory is embarrassed by the possibility of utility monsters.\n\nThis seems to be the conclusion because the entire argument is about how utilitarianism struggles with the idea of utility monsters.\n\nB. A utility monster gets enormous gains in utility.\n\nThis is more of a definition or a premise about what a utility monster is, not the conclusion.\n\nC. A utility monster gets gains in utility greater than the utility lost by the sacrifices of others.\n\nThis is another part of the definition or premise, explaining the relationship between the monster's gains and others' losses.\n\nD. The sacrifices of even large numbers of other people are outweighed by the gains of the utility monster.\n\nThis seems to be a consequence of the previous points, showing how utilitarianism might justify such sacrifices.\n\nGiven this, option A seems to be the conclusion because it sums up the main point: that utilitarian theory has a problem with utility monsters.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe the conclusion is that utilitarian theory requires that we all be sacrificed for the utility monster, and thus, utilitarianism is flawed. So, perhaps the conclusion is implicit beyond what's stated.\n\nWait, the last sentence says, \"The theory seems to require that we all be sacrificed in the monster's maw in order to increase total utility.\" This sounds like the conclusion because it's presenting the implication of the earlier points.\n\nSo, is the conclusion that utilitarian theory requires sacrificing everyone for the utility monster, which is problematic?\n\nBut looking back, option A directly states that utilitarian theory is embarrassed by utility monsters, which is essentially saying that there's a problem with utilitarianism regarding utility monsters.\n\nOption A seems to be the most straightforward conclusion based on the text provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the conclusion is that utilitarian theory leads to unacceptable sacrifices for the sake of utility monsters, but that's not exactly one of the options.\n\nGiven the options, I think A is the best choice.\n\nWait, but the question is to identify the conclusion of the following argument, and the argument is presented as a block of text, not as multiple choices. The multiple choices are likely options someone is providing for selection.\n\nBut in the way the question is phrased, it seems like the argument is the paragraph provided, and the options are to choose the conclusion from among A, B, C, D.\n\nGiven that, and considering the argument, I still think A is the conclusion.\n\nLet me consider the structure:\n\n- Premise: Utilitarian theory is embarrassed by utility monsters.\n\n- Explanation: Utility monsters get enormous utility gains.\n\n- Explanation: Their gains outweigh the sacrifices of others.\n\n- Explanation: Thus, theory requires sacrificing many for one.\n\n- Conclusion: Utilitarian theory is problematic due to utility monsters.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that utilitarian theory has issues with utility monsters, which is option A.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are more explanatory points or implications arising from the premise.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
