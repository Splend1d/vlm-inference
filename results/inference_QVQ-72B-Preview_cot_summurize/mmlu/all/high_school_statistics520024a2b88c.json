                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, the storekeeper surveyed 100 female customers and 120 male customers about whether they're interested in shopping on Sundays. He then calculated a 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions\u2014specifically, the proportion of females minus the proportion of males who said \"yes.\" The interval he got is from -0.23 to -0.18.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a confidence interval is. A 95% confidence interval means that if we were to repeat this survey many times, about 95% of the intervals calculated from those samples would contain the true difference in proportions. So, this interval gives us a range within which we're fairly confident the actual difference lies.\n\nNow, the interval is from -0.23 to -0.18. Since it's negative, that suggests that the proportion of females interested in shopping on Sundays is less than the proportion of males interested in shopping on Sundays. Let's confirm that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\( \\hat{p}_f \\) as the sample proportion of females who said \"yes.\"\n\n- \\( \\hat{p}_m \\) as the sample proportion of males who said \"yes.\"\n\nThe difference is \\( \\hat{p}_f - \\hat{p}_m \\), and the confidence interval is for this difference, which is from -0.23 to -0.18.\n\nSince the interval is entirely negative, it means that \\( \\hat{p}_f \\) is less than \\( \\hat{p}_m \\) in the sample. Moreover, because the interval doesn't include zero, it suggests that the difference is statistically significant at the 5% level.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays.\n\nThis would imply that \\( \\hat{p}_f - \\hat{p}_m > 0 \\), which contradicts our interval that is entirely negative. So, this can't be right.\n\nB. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays.\n\nThis would correspond to \\( \\hat{p}_m - \\hat{p}_f > 0 \\), but remember that the interval is for \\( \\hat{p}_f - \\hat{p}_m \\). So, if \\( \\hat{p}_f - \\hat{p}_m \\) is negative, then \\( \\hat{p}_m - \\hat{p}_f \\) is positive. Therefore, this option seems plausible.\n\nC. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays is equal to the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays.\n\nThis would suggest that \\( \\hat{p}_f - \\hat{p}_m = 0 \\), but our interval doesn't include zero, so this isn't supported by the data.\n\nD. Because the interval contains negative values, it is invalid and should not be interpreted.\n\nJust because the interval contains negative values doesn't make it invalid. In proportions, negative differences simply indicate that one group has a lower proportion than the other. So, this is incorrect.\n\nSo, based on this, option B seems to be the correct interpretation.\n\nWait a minute, but let's think carefully. The interval is for \\( \\hat{p}_f - \\hat{p}_m \\), and it's from -0.23 to -0.18. So, \\( \\hat{p}_f - \\hat{p}_m \\) is negative, meaning fewer females are interested compared to males.\n\nOption B states that the proportion of men interested exceeds the proportion of women interested. That would correspond to \\( \\hat{p}_m - \\hat{p}_f > 0 \\), which is the opposite of what the interval is giving directly.\n\nBut actually, since \\( \\hat{p}_f - \\hat{p}_m \\) is negative, \\( \\hat{p}_m - \\hat{p}_f \\) is positive. So, yes, the proportion of men interested is higher than that of women.\n\nTherefore, option B is indeed correct.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the meaning again. A 95% confidence interval for the difference \\( \\hat{p}_f - \\hat{p}_m \\) being (-0.23, -0.18) means we are 95% confident that the true difference in proportions (females minus males) lies between -0.23 and -0.18. Since this range is all negative, it consistently shows that the proportion for females is less than that for males.\n\nHence, we can conclude with 95% confidence that the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
