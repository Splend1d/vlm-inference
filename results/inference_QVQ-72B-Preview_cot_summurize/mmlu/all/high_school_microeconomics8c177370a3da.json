                    "text": "Let's see here. I'm looking at this question about a perfectly competitive firm, and there are four options. I need to pick the one that's accurate. Okay, let's go through them one by one.\n\nOption A says that demand is downward-sloping. Hmm, in perfect competition, I think the demand curve for an individual firm is perfectly elastic, right? Like, it's a horizontal line. So, that doesn't sound like a downward-sloping curve. Maybe this isn't accurate.\n\nOption B says that the demand curve lies above the marginal revenue curve. Well, in perfect competition, the demand curve for the firm is horizontal, and marginal revenue is the same as the price, which is also the demand curve. So, they should be the same, meaning the demand curve doesn't lie above the marginal revenue curve; they're overlapping. So, this might not be accurate.\n\nOption C says that price is determined by the equilibrium in the entire market. That sounds right. In perfect competition, the market price is determined by the intersection of the market demand and market supply curves, and individual firms take that price as given. So, this seems like a correct statement.\n\nOption D says that average revenue differs from price. In perfect competition, average revenue is total revenue divided by quantity, which is just price per unit. So, average revenue should be equal to price, not differ from it. So, this statement seems incorrect.\n\nAlright, so based on this, it seems like Option C is the accurate statement. Let me just double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nIn perfect competition, firms are price takers, meaning they accept the market price as given and can sell as much as they want at that price without affecting the market price. The demand curve for an individual firm is horizontal at the market price, indicating that quantity demanded is infinitely elastic at the market price.\n\nSo, Option A is incorrect because the demand curve is not downward-sloping; it's horizontal.\n\nOption B is incorrect because, in perfect competition, the demand curve (which is horizontal at the market price) is the same as the marginal revenue curve. There's no difference between them.\n\nOption C is correct because, indeed, the market determines the price through the interaction of all buyers and sellers in the market.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, in perfect competition, average revenue equals price.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
