                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios, and I need to decide which one involves something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards at that time. The options are A: both are wrong, B: first is wrong, second is not, C: first is not wrong, second is wrong, and D: neither is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020. Generally, moral wrongs involve harming others, breaking laws, or violating social norms and expectations.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"As I watched cartoons, Mo rushed to the playground.\"\n\nSo, in this scenario, I'm watching cartoons, and Mo is rushing to the playground. What's happening here? It seems like I'm just watching cartoons, and Mo is going to the playground. There doesn't seem to be any interaction between us in this scenario. So, is there anything morally wrong here?\n\nWell, if I'm watching cartoons and Mo is going to the playground, and there's no context provided that suggests anything unethical is happening, then it seems like this is a neutral activity. Maybe I'm taking a break or relaxing, and Mo is going out to play. Unless there's more to this situation, like maybe I was supposed to supervise Mo or something, but that's not mentioned. Based on what's given, it doesn't appear that I'm doing anything morally wrong in Scenario 1.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"His toilet was clogged and blocked with food that was not processed enough so I tried putting a plunger in his toilet to unclog it.\"\n\nOkay, so here, someone's toilet is clogged with food, and I attempt to fix it by using a plunger. Is this morally wrong?\n\nFirst, trying to fix a clogged toilet seems like a helpful action. Using a plunger is a standard method for unclogging toilets. So, on the surface, it seems like I'm trying to solve a problem, which is a positive thing.\n\nHowever, there might be some considerations here. For example, if I don't own the property or if I don't have permission to fix the toilet, maybe it's not my place to interfere. But again, without more context, it's hard to say. Assuming I have the right to try to fix the toilet, like if it's my own home or if I have permission, then attempting to unclog it with a plunger seems like a reasonable and morally neutral action.\n\nBut wait, the scenario says \"his toilet,\" which implies it's someone else's toilet. So, maybe I'm helping a friend or a neighbor. In that case, if I'm asked to help, using a plunger is an appropriate response. If I'm not asked, but I see the problem and try to help anyway, that could still be seen as a good deed.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm causing the problem by putting something inappropriate in the toilet, that would be different. But the scenario says the toilet is already clogged with food, and I'm trying to fix it, not cause more issues.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, it seems like in Scenario 2, I'm also not doing anything morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither scenario involves a clearly morally wrong action by the main character.\n\nSo, the answer should be D: Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, watching cartoons and Mo going to the playground\u2014seems innocuous. Unless there's some duty I'm neglecting by not supervising Mo, but again, no context suggests that.\n\nIn Scenario 2, trying to unclog a toilet with a plunger seems like a helpful action, assuming I have the right to do so.\n\nSo, yeah, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
