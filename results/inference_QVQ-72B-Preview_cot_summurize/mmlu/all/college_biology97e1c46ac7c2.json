                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about embryonic cleavage, and I need to figure out which statement isn't true. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that the presence of yolk inhibits cleavage. Hmm, I remember that yolk can affect cleavage patterns in eggs. In eggs with a lot of yolk, like bird eggs, the cleavage pattern is modified because the yolk can get in the way of cell divisions. So, maybe yolk does inhibit cleavage to some extent. But is it accurate to say that yolk inhibits cleavage altogether? Maybe not entirely, because cleavage still occurs, just differently.\n\nOption B says that telolecithal eggs undergo meroblastic cleavage. Telolecithal eggs are ones with a lot of yolk concentrated at one end, right? And meroblastic cleavage is when the cleavage is incomplete, and only the part without yolk divides fully. So, yeah, that seems correct. Telolecithal eggs typically undergo meroblastic cleavage because the yolk prevents complete division of the egg.\n\nOption C says that the vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than the animal pole. Wait a minute, in most eggs, especially in animals like frogs and birds, the vegetal pole has more yolk. Given that yolk can inhibit cleavage, as I thought earlier, I would imagine that the animal pole, which has less yolk, would cleave more readily. So, this statement seems contrary to what I know. Maybe this is the incorrect statement.\n\nOption D says that the rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres. Blastomeres are the cells resulting from cleavage divisions during early embryogenesis. So, cleavage is the process of rapid cell divisions that turn a single zygote into a multi-cellular embryo composed of blastomeres. This seems accurate.\n\nBased on my understanding, option C seems to be the incorrect statement. Let me double-check.\n\nIn amphibians like frogs, the vegetal pole has more yolk, and cleavage is typically slower and less complete there compared to the animal pole, which has less yolk and cleaves more readily. So, yes, I think the statement in option C is not true. It should be that the animal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than the vegetal pole due to the presence of more yolk at the vegetal pole.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than does the animal pole.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
