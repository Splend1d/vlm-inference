Later that same day, he approached a victim and, brandishing a knife, told her to accompany him or he would stab her. He led the victim to his car and then ordered her to disrobe. As the victim was removing her pantyhose, she kicked the defendant in the head, temporarily dazing him. The victim then safely ran from the car. The defendant is arrested and charged with the crime of assault with the intent to commit rape.\nB. A defendant attended a wedding reception at a hotel, where he drank several vodka daiquiris. Following the reception, the defendant engaged in a violent argument with the hotel's parking lot attendant. The defendant took a tire iron from his car and threw it at the attendant. The tire iron missed the attendant and hit a victim as he was entering the hotel. The defendant is arrested and charged with assault with the intent to commit battery.\nC. A defendant had been drinking liquor all evening at a bar with three of his buddies. An undercover detective overheard the defendant and his buddies plot to rob the bar after closing hours. When the defendant attempted to draw a gun from his coat, he was quickly disarmed and placed under arrest by the detective. The defendant is charged with the crime of conspiracy to commit robbery.\nD. At his law school graduation party, a defendant drank two six-packs of beer. Around midnight, the defendant was approached by a girl, who asked him to drive her home. Although the girl was only 15 years old, she had the appearance of a woman in her mid-to-late twenties. The defendant, who had had his eye on the girl all night, quickly agreed, and he showed her the way to his car. Once inside, they engaged in sexual intercourse. The age of consent in this jurisdiction is 17 years old for females. The defendant is subsequently arrested and charged with statutory rape.\n"

                    "text": "So I have this question about when a defendant's intoxication can't be used to negate criminal culpability. There are four scenarios, and I need to pick the one where intoxication wouldn't help the defendant avoid responsibility. I'm supposed to think about how intoxication affects the defendant's ability to form the necessary intent for the crime.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"negate his criminal culpability\" means. I think it means that the defendant is trying to say that because they were drunk, they shouldn't be held fully responsible for their actions. Maybe they couldn't form the intent to commit the crime because they were too intoxicated.\n\nSo, in each scenario, I need to look at what the crime is and what kind of intent is required, and then see how intoxication might or might not affect that intent.\n\nLet's look at option A:\n\nA defendant drank a fifth of bourbon and then approached a woman with a knife, threatening her and ordering her to disrobe. He's charged with assault with the intent to commit rape.\n\nHere, the crime is assault with intent to commit rape. Intent is a key part of this crime. If the defendant was so drunk that he couldn't form the specific intent to rape, maybe he could argue that he shouldn't be held responsible for that particular intent.\n\nBut, I recall that in many jurisdictions, intoxication isn't a defense for specific intent crimes if the intoxication was voluntary. Maybe there are exceptions or specific rules about how much intoxication can negate intent.\n\nMoving on to option B:\n\nA defendant drank several vodka daiquiris at a wedding and then got into an argument with a parking attendant. He threw a tire iron that missed the attendant but hit someone else. He's charged with assault with the intent to commit battery.\n\nAssault with intent to commit battery requires intent to cause harm or offensive contact. If the defendant was too drunk to intend to harm someone, maybe he can argue that he didn't have the required intent.\n\nHowever, if the act was reckless and he should have known that throwing a tire iron could hurt someone, maybe intoxication doesn't excuse that recklessness.\n\nOption C:\n\nA defendant was drinking with friends and was overheard plotting to rob the bar. He's charged with conspiracy to commit robbery.\n\nConspiracy requires an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime, coupled with an act in furtherance of the conspiracy. Intent is involved here too. If the defendant was too intoxicated to form the agreement or to have the specific intent to rob, maybe he can argue that the conspiracy charge shouldn't stand.\n\nBut, again, voluntary intoxication might not be a valid defense for forming a conspiracy.\n\nOption D:\n\nA defendant drank a lot at his graduation party and then had sex with a 15-year-old girl who looked older. He's charged with statutory rape.\n\nStatutory rape is having sex with someone below a certain age, regardless of consent. The age of consent here is 17. So, the defendant had sex with someone who was 15, which is below the age of consent.\n\nNow, statutory rape is generally a strict liability crime, meaning that the defendant's intent or state of mind isn't a defense. Even if he didn't know the person was under age, or was too drunk to know, he can still be held responsible.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, the girl looked older, and the defendant thought she was older. But the law says that mistake of age isn't a defense in statutory rape cases.\n\nSo, in this case, even if the defendant was intoxicated and didn't know her real age, it probably wouldn't matter because statutory rape is a strict liability offense.\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, statutory rape is indeed a strict liability crime. That means that the defendant's belief about the victim's age, or his intoxication, doesn't affect his culpability. He can still be convicted even if he honestly believed the victim was of age.\n\nSo, in option D, intoxication wouldn't negate his criminal culpability because the crime is strict liability.\n\nNow, comparing this to the other options:\n\nIn option A, assault with intent to commit rape requires specific intent, and intoxication might be a defense if it prevents the defendant from forming that intent. But it's not clear if voluntary intoxication is accepted as a defense in that context.\n\nIn option B, assault with intent to commit battery also requires intent, and again, intoxication might affect the defendant's ability to form that intent.\n\nIn option C, conspiracy to commit robbery requires intent to agree and to commit the crime, and intoxication might affect that.\n\nBut in option D, statutory rape is strict liability, so intoxication doesn't matter.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. The defendant's intoxication wouldn't be able to negate his criminal culpability in this situation because statutory rape is a strict liability offense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
