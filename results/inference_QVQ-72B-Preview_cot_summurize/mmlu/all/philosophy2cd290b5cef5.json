                    "text": "So I'm trying to answer this question about Tolstoy's life after he had a crisis of meaning. The options are:\n\nA. His income increased dramatically.\n\nB. He distrusted everyone.\n\nC. He became religious.\n\nD. He became an agnostic.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a crisis of meaning entails. Generally, a crisis of meaning refers to a period in someone's life when they question the purpose and value of their existence or their beliefs. It's often a time of deep introspection and soul-searching, which can lead to significant changes in one's worldview and lifestyle.\n\nLeo Tolstoy, the famous Russian author known for works like \"War and Peace\" and \"Anna Karenina,\" is well-documented as having experienced such a crisis in his middle age. From what I remember, this crisis led him to reevaluate his life, his writings, and his spiritual beliefs.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: His income increased dramatically.\n\nI need to think about whether Tolstoy's income increased after his crisis of meaning. Tolstoy came from a wealthy aristocratic family and inherited a large estate, so he always had a comfortable income. However, after his crisis, he became more concerned with spiritual and moral issues rather than material wealth. In fact, he eventually renounced his noble title and advocated for a simple, peasant-like lifestyle. So, it's unlikely that his income increased dramatically after this period, especially since he gave away much of his wealth and even considered communal living.\n\nOption B: He distrusted everyone.\n\nThis seems a bit extreme. While it's common for people undergoing a crisis of meaning to question their relationships and the motives of others, Tolstoy's crisis led him more towards self-reflection and a search for genuine spiritual truth rather than developing mistrust towards others. In fact, his later writings emphasize the importance of love, forgiveness, and compassion towards others, which suggests that he didn't develop a general distrust of people.\n\nOption C: He became religious.\n\nThis seems plausible. Tolstoy's crisis of meaning was deeply spiritual, and he did undergo a significant religious awakening. He was dissatisfied with the orthodox Christianity of his time and explored various philosophical and religious texts, including those from Eastern traditions. Eventually, he developed his own set of religious beliefs, which emphasized the teachings of Jesus but in a more personalized and simplified form. He believed in non-resistance to evil and the importance of living a moral life based on the Golden Rule.\n\nOption D: He became an agnostic.\n\nAgnosticism is the view that the existence of God or the ultimate cause of the universe is unknown and probably unknowable. Given that Tolstoy did develop a strong set of religious beliefs, even if they were unorthodox, it's unlikely that he became an agnostic. He was quite certain about his spiritual convictions and wrote extensively about them in works like \"The Kingdom of God Is Within You.\"\n\nConsidering all this, option C\u2014He became religious\u2014seems to be the most accurate answer. His crisis of meaning led him to embrace a new set of religious beliefs and to live a life more in line with his spiritual values.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it again. Did his crisis lead him to become more religious, or did it lead him to question religion altogether? From what I recall, Tolstoy did question organized religion, but he didn't reject the idea of God or spirituality. Instead, he redefined his understanding of religion and God in a way that made more sense to him personally.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after his crisis of meaning, Tolstoy became more religious, but in his own unique way. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
