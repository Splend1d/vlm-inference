                    "text": "So I need to figure out in which year the United States last won an Olympic gold medal in men's ice hockey. The options are 1976, 1980, 1984, and 1988. Hmm, I think I remember something about the \"Miracle on Ice,\" but I'm not sure which year that was. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I know that the Olympic Games happen every four years, and they alternate between winter and summer games. But since we're talking about ice hockey, that's a winter sport, so the Olympic years would be for the winter games.\n\nI recall that the \"Miracle on Ice\" was when the US men's hockey team won gold in 1980, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the last time they won. Maybe they won again in another year? Let me consider each option.\n\nStarting with 1976: That was the year of the Montreal Summer Olympics, but since ice hockey is a winter sport, I don't think the Olympics were held that year for hockey. Wait, no, actually, the 1976 Winter Olympics were held in Innsbruck, Austria. But I don't remember if the US won gold in ice hockey that year. Maybe not.\n\nNext is 1980: This rings a bell. I think this was when the US hockey team, consisting mostly of college players, surprisingly defeated the heavily favored Soviet team and then went on to win the gold medal. That was the \"Miracle on Ice.\" So, they did win in 1980.\n\nNow, 1984: The Winter Olympics were held in Sarajevo that year. Did the US men's hockey team win gold again? I don't think so. I believe they didn't make it to the finals that year.\n\nLastly, 1988: The Winter Olympics were in Calgary. Again, I don't recall the US men's hockey team winning gold that year. I think they performed decently but didn't reach the top.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like 1980 was the last time the US won an Olympic gold medal in men's ice hockey. But wait, maybe they won again after that? Let me double-check.\n\nI know that in 2010 and 2014, the US men's hockey team didn't win gold. In 2010, Canada won, and in 2014, Canada won again. So, that's after 1988, and they didn't win in those years.\n\nLooking back, perhaps 1980 was indeed the last time. But just to be thorough, let me check if there were any other years between 1980 and 1988 where the US might have won.\n\nIn 1984, as I thought earlier, I don't believe the US won gold. And in 1988, also no gold medal for the US men's team.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. 1980.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 1980} \\]"
