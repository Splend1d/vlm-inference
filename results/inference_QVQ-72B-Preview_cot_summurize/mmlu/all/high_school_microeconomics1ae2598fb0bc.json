                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of the following goods is likely to provide both the largest total utility and the smallest marginal utility?\n\nA. Plastic\n\nB. Automobiles\n\nC. Computers\n\nD. Air\"\n\nAlright, let's try to understand what's being asked here. Total utility refers to the total satisfaction or benefit a person gets from consuming a particular good or service. Marginal utility, on the other hand, is the additional satisfaction from consuming one more unit of that good or service.\n\nThe question is asking for the good that provides the largest total utility but the smallest marginal utility. So, I need to find something that gives a lot of overall satisfaction but adding one more unit doesn't give much extra satisfaction.\n\nFirst, let's think about total utility. Which of these goods would provide the most total utility? Well, that might depend on the context and the person's preferences. But maybe we can make some general assumptions.\n\nPlastic is ubiquitous; it's used in many products, from packaging to household items. So, it might provide a lot of total utility because it's so widely used.\n\nAutomobiles are essential for transportation for many people, providing mobility and convenience, which could be considered high total utility.\n\nComputers are also crucial in modern life, used for work, communication, entertainment, and education, so they likely provide significant total utility.\n\nAir is essential for survival; without air, we can't live. So, it's fundamental and provides necessary utility for basic functioning.\n\nNow, considering marginal utility. Marginal utility tends to decrease as more units of a good are consumed. This is known as the law of diminishing marginal utility. So, the more of something you have, the less additional benefit you get from one more unit.\n\nPlastic: While plastic is useful, having one more plastic item might not add much utility, especially considering the environmental impact.\n\nAutomobiles: After a certain point, having another car might not add much utility, especially if you already have multiple vehicles.\n\nComputers: Similarly, after having a few computers, an additional one might not provide much extra utility, unless it's for a specific purpose.\n\nAir: This is interesting. Air is necessary for survival, but since it's abundant and free, the marginal utility of one more unit (say, one more breath) might be very low, assuming you're already getting enough air.\n\nBut wait, total utility is the sum of all units consumed, while marginal utility is the utility from the last unit consumed.\n\nGiven that, air is something we consume in large quantities constantly, and each additional breath provides a small marginal utility, but the total utility is quite high because it's essential for life.\n\nSimilarly, plastic is consumed in large quantities, but each additional piece might not add much utility.\n\nAutomobiles and computers are more significant purchases, and additional units might not add as much utility as the first one.\n\nBut the question is asking for the good that provides both the largest total utility and the smallest marginal utility.\n\nSo, among these options, air seems to stand out because it's consumed in vast amounts, providing high total utility, but each additional unit (breath) provides a very small marginal utility since it's so abundant and necessary.\n\nPlastic is also consumed in large quantities, but its marginal utility might be lower than air's because it's not as essential for survival.\n\nAutomobiles and computers are high-utility items, but their marginal utility decreases rapidly after the first one or two.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting answer is air, as it provides the largest total utility due to its constant consumption and necessity, but the smallest marginal utility because each additional unit is not as valuable as the previous ones, given its abundance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Air}} \\]"
