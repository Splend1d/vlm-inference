                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question about Sikhism. It's asking what term refers to the divine order as an all-embracing higher principle in Sikhism. The options are Sansar, Hukam, Mantar, and Karam. Hmm, I need to recall what each of these terms means in the context of Sikhism.\n\nFirst, let's think about \"Sansar.\" I know that in some religions, like Hinduism, \"sansar\" refers to the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. But in Sikhism, I think it has a similar connotation of the worldly existence or the material world. So, maybe it's not the best fit for describing the divine order.\n\nNext, \"Hukam.\" This rings a bell. In Sikhism, \"hukam\" often refers to the will or command of God. It's about the divine ordination that governs the universe. This sounds like it could be the all-embracing higher principle mentioned in the question.\n\nThen there's \"Mantar.\" I remember that in Sikhism, a \"mantar\" is a sacred sound or phrase that is repeated as a form of meditation or prayer. It's more about spiritual practice rather than the divine order itself.\n\nLastly, \"Karam\" makes me think of karma, which in Sikhism is the concept of cause and effect. It's about the consequences of one's actions, but again, that seems more related to individual behavior rather than the overall divine order.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, \"Hukam\" seems to be the most appropriate choice. It directly refers to the divine will or order that encompasses everything in the universe, which aligns perfectly with the description provided in the question.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check my understanding. In Sikhism, Hukam is a fundamental concept that represents the sovereign will of the divine. It's seen as the guiding force behind all creation, governing both the natural world and the moral order. So, yes, that definitely fits the bill as an all-embracing higher principle.\n\nI don't think it's Sansar, because that's more about the worldly existence and the cycle of life, which isn't directly about the divine order. Mantar is more about spiritual practice and meditation, and Karam is about individual actions and their consequences. None of these capture the idea of the divine order in the same way that Hukam does.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. Hukam.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ Hukam} \\]"
