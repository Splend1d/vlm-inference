From what I can gather, it's about how our self-concept is shaped by how we think others see us. So, let's break this down.\n\nOption A says it's about young children realizing they have a separate identity. Hmm, that sounds more like something related to developmental psychology, maybe ego development or something. I don't think that's the main idea of Cooley's theory.\n\nOption B mentions the difficulty one experiences in seeing oneself as others do. Well, that seems more related to empathy or perspective-taking. Cooley's theory isn't really about the difficulty; it's more about how our self-perception is influenced by what we think others perceive in us.\n\nOption C states that one's self-concept is based on one's perception of how others see one. This seems to align closely with Cooley's idea. He talked about the looking-glass self being composed of three main components: the imagination of our appearance to the other person; the imagination of his judgment of that appearance; and some sort of self-feeling, such as pride or mortification.\n\nOption D suggests that our self-concept is heavily influenced by our physical appearance. While physical appearance can be a part of how others perceive us, Cooley's theory is broader than just physical attributes. It encompasses all aspects of how we think others see us, which could include personality, social status, behavior, and so on.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the correct answer is C. It directly refers to how our self-concept is based on our perception of others' views of us, which is the crux of Cooley's looking-glass self theory.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. Cooley believed that our self-image is formed by reflecting on how others see us, much like looking in a mirror. So, it's not just about realizing we have a separate identity (A), or the difficulty in seeing ourselves as others do (B), or solely based on physical appearance (D). It's about our overall self-concept being shaped by the reflected appraisals from others.\n\nYeah, I'm confident that C is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
