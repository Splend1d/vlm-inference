                    "text": "Let's tackle this logic problem. I need to construct a truth table for the given argument and then determine if it's valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I have to pick the correct counterexample from the options provided.\n\nFirst, let's understand the argument. It's in the form of a logical implication:\n\n~K \u2261 L / (K \u00b7 L) \u2228 (K \u00b7 ~L)\n\nThis looks like a conditional statement, where the part before the slash is the premise, and the part after the slash is the conclusion. So, the argument is:\n\nPremise: ~K \u2261 L\n\nConclusion: (K \u00b7 L) \u2228 (K \u00b7 ~L)\n\nHere, ~ denotes negation, \u2261 denotes logical equivalence, \u2228 denotes logical disjunction (or), and \u00b7 denotes logical conjunction (and).\n\nTo construct a truth table, I need to evaluate the truth values of the premise and the conclusion for all possible combinations of truth values for K and L. Since there are two variables, there are 2^2 = 4 possible combinations.\n\nLet's list them:\n\n1. K is true, L is true\n\n2. K is true, L is false\n\n3. K is false, L is true\n\n4. K is false, L is false\n\nFor each of these, I need to determine the truth values of the premise and the conclusion.\n\nFirst, let's define the premise: ~K \u2261 L\n\nRecall that \u2261 means logical equivalence, which is true when both sides have the same truth value, and false otherwise. So, ~K \u2261 L is true if and only if ~K and L have the same truth value.\n\nSimilarly, the conclusion is (K \u00b7 L) \u2228 (K \u00b7 ~L). This is a disjunction of two conjunctions involving K and L.\n\nLet's construct the truth table step by step.\n\nStep 1: Assign truth values to K and L.\n\nStep 2: Calculate ~K.\n\nStep 3: Calculate ~L.\n\nStep 4: Calculate K \u00b7 L.\n\nStep 5: Calculate K \u00b7 ~L.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the premise: ~K \u2261 L.\n\nStep 7: Calculate the conclusion: (K \u00b7 L) \u2228 (K \u00b7 ~L).\n\nStep 8: Determine if the argument is valid by checking if whenever the premise is true, the conclusion is also true.\n\nLet's start with the first row: K is true, L is true.\n\n1. K: T\n\n2. L: T\n\n3. ~K: F\n\n4. ~L: F\n\n5. K \u00b7 L: T \u00b7 T = T\n\n6. K \u00b7 ~L: T \u00b7 F = F\n\n7. Premise: ~K \u2261 L \u2192 F \u2261 T \u2192 F (since F \u2261 T is false)\n\n8. Conclusion: (T) \u2228 (F) = T\n\nSo, in this case, the premise is false, and the conclusion is true. Since the premise is false, the implication is true.\n\nNext, K is true, L is false.\n\n1. K: T\n\n2. L: F\n\n3. ~K: F\n\n4. ~L: T\n\n5. K \u00b7 L: T \u00b7 F = F\n\n6. K \u00b7 ~L: T \u00b7 T = T\n\n7. Premise: ~K \u2261 L \u2192 F \u2261 F \u2192 F (since F \u2261 F is true)\n\n8. Conclusion: (F) \u2228 (T) = T\n\nHere, the premise is true, and the conclusion is true. So, the implication holds.\n\nThird row: K is false, L is true.\n\n1. K: F\n\n2. L: T\n\n3. ~K: T\n\n4. ~L: F\n\n5. K \u00b7 L: F \u00b7 T = F\n\n6. K \u00b7 ~L: F \u00b7 F = F\n\n7. Premise: ~K \u2261 L \u2192 T \u2261 T \u2192 T (since T \u2261 T is true)\n\n8. Conclusion: (F) \u2228 (F) = F\n\nIn this case, the premise is true, but the conclusion is false. This means the implication is false, indicating that the argument is invalid.\n\nFinally, K is false, L is false.\n\n1. K: F\n\n2. L: F\n\n3. ~K: T\n\n4. ~L: T\n\n5. K \u00b7 L: F \u00b7 F = F\n\n6. K \u00b7 ~L: F \u00b7 T = F\n\n7. Premise: ~K \u2261 L \u2192 T \u2261 F \u2192 T (since T \u2261 F is false)\n\n8. Conclusion: (F) \u2228 (F) = F\n\nHere, the premise is false, and the conclusion is false. Since the premise is false, the implication is true.\n\nSo, from the truth table, we see that the argument is invalid because there is at least one row where the premise is true and the conclusion is false (the third row).\n\nNow, I need to choose the correct counterexample from the options provided:\n\nA. Valid\n\nB. Invalid. Counterexample when K and L are true\n\nC. Invalid. Counterexample when K is true and L is false\n\nD. Invalid. Counterexample when L is true and K is false\n\nFrom the truth table, the counterexample is when K is false and L is true (third row), where the premise is true and the conclusion is false.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B: K and L are true. In our first row, the premise is false, so not a counterexample.\n\nOption C: K is true and L is false. In the second row, the premise is true and the conclusion is true, so not a counterexample.\n\nOption D: L is true and K is false. This matches our third row, where the premise is true and the conclusion is false, which is the counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Invalid. Counterexample when L is true and K is false.\n\nBut wait, option D says \"when L is true and K is false,\" which aligns with our third row where K is false and L is true, and the premise is true while the conclusion is false.\n\nOption C says \"when K is true and L is false,\" but in our second row, when K is true and L is false, the premise is true and the conclusion is true, which doesn't serve as a counterexample.\n\nOption B has K and L both true, which in the first row, the premise is false, so not a counterexample.\n\nOption D is the correct choice.\n\nSo, the final answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
