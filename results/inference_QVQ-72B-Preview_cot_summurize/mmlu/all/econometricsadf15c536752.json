                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these options isn't a feature of continuously compounded returns, also known as log-returns. I'm not super familiar with this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what continuously compounded returns are. From what I recall, continuously compounded returns are based on the natural logarithm of the price ratios. So, if I have a stock price at time t and at time t+1, the log-return would be ln(P_{t+1}/P_t). That makes sense.\n\nOption A says that they can be interpreted as continuously compounded changes in prices. That sounds right because the formula I just thought of is a measure of how much the price has changed, expressed in logarithmic terms, which essentially gives the continuous compounding rate.\n\nOption B says they can be added over time to give returns for longer time periods. Hmm, I think this is a property of log-returns. Since log-returns are logarithms, and logarithms of ratios can be added together, this seems plausible. For example, if I have daily log-returns, I can sum them up to get the log-return for a week or a month.\n\nOption C says they can be added across a portfolio of assets to give portfolio returns. Wait a minute, I'm a bit unsure about this. I thought that for portfolio returns, you typically weight the individual asset returns by their portfolio weights. But maybe with log-returns, it's different. Maybe you can just add them up if the portfolio is equally weighted, but generally, you need to account for the weights.\n\nOption D says they are usually fat-tailed. Fat-tailed distributions have heavier tails than a normal distribution, meaning there are more extreme events than expected. I've heard that financial returns can exhibit fat tails, but I'm not sure if this is specifically true for log-returns or if it's a general property of financial returns.\n\nAlright, so I need to decide which one of these is not a feature of continuously compounded returns. Let me think again.\n\nOption A seems correct because that's the definition of log-returns.\n\nOption B also seems correct because one of the advantages of log-returns is that they are time-additive, meaning you can sum them over time.\n\nOption C is making me think twice. In portfolio theory, the return on a portfolio is the weighted average of the returns on the individual assets. So, if I have two assets with weights w1 and w2, the portfolio return would be w1*r1 + w2*r2, where r1 and r2 are the returns of the assets. But with log-returns, can you just add them up across different assets? I don't think so, because each asset has its own return, and to get the portfolio return, you need to account for the weights of the assets in the portfolio. So, maybe this is the incorrect statement.\n\nOption D is a bit tricky. I know that financial returns often exhibit fat tails, which is a stylized fact in financial econometrics. However, I'm not sure if this is unique to log-returns or if it's a general property of financial returns regardless of the type of return calculation.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option D is also not a feature specific to log-returns, but since the question is about \"NOT a feature,\" having fat tails might not be exclusive to log-returns, but it's still a property they can have.\n\nWait, but the question is asking which of these is NOT a feature of continuously compounded returns. So, if fat-tailed distributions are a common feature of financial returns, including log-returns, then maybe it's not the correct choice to pick.\n\nLet me consider this differently. Maybe the question is trying to test whether I understand that fat tails are a general property of financial returns and not specific to log-returns. In that case, perhaps D is not incorrect per se, but it might not be the best answer to the question.\n\nComparing options C and D, I think option C is more directly incorrect because adding log-returns across assets doesn't give you the portfolio return unless the portfolio is equally weighted and there are no correlations between assets. In general, for a portfolio, you need to consider the weighted sum of the individual asset returns, not just add the log-returns.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the one that is NOT a feature of continuously compounded returns because, in practice, you can't simply add log-returns across different assets to get the portfolio return without considering the weights.\n\nI think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
