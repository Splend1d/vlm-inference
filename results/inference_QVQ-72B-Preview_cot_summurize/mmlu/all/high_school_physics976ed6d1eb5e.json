                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: an object carries a charge of \u20131 C, and I need to figure out how many excess electrons it has. The options are pretty big numbers, like in the billions, but I'm not sure about the exact value yet. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that charge is measured in coulombs (C), and electrons are particles that carry charge. Each electron has a charge of \u20131.602 \u00d7 10^-19 C. Since the object has a total charge of \u20131 C, that means there are more electrons than protons, hence the negative charge.\n\nTo find out how many excess electrons there are, I should probably divide the total charge by the charge of a single electron. So, if each electron contributes \u20131.602 \u00d7 10^-19 C, then the number of electrons, N, would be:\n\nN = total charge / charge per electron\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nN = 1 C / (1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 C/electron)\n\nWait, but the charge is \u20131 C, and each electron has \u20131.602 \u00d7 10^-19 C. Since both are negative, the division should give a positive number, which makes sense because the number of electrons can't be negative.\n\nLet me do the math carefully:\n\nN = 1 / (1.602 \u00d7 10^-19)\n\nI should make sure to handle the units correctly. Since both are in coulombs, the units will cancel out, leaving just a number of electrons.\n\nLet me calculate 1 divided by 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19.\n\nFirst, 1 divided by 1.602 is approximately 0.624.\n\nThen, dividing by 10^-19 is the same as multiplying by 10^19.\n\nSo, 0.624 \u00d7 10^19 = 6.24 \u00d7 10^18.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 6.25 \u00d7 10^18\n\nB. 8.00 \u00d7 10^18\n\nC. 1.60 \u00d7 10^19\n\nD. 3.20 \u00d7 10^19\n\nMy calculation gives me approximately 6.24 \u00d7 10^18, which is closest to option A. 6.25 \u00d7 10^18.\n\nBut I should check if there's a more precise way to calculate this or if I've made any mistakes.\n\nLet me verify the charge of an electron. I recall that the elementary charge, which is the magnitude of the charge of an electron, is approximately 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 C. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, dividing 1 C by 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 C/electron should indeed give the number of electrons.\n\nLet me try to be more precise with the division.\n\n1 divided by 1.602 is approximately 0.62428.\n\nThen, 0.62428 \u00d7 10^19 = 6.2428 \u00d7 10^18.\n\nSo, roughly 6.24 \u00d7 10^18 electrons.\n\nLooking at the options again, option A is 6.25 \u00d7 10^18, which is very close to my calculation. The other options are significantly different.\n\nI think the slight difference might be due to rounding during the calculation. The exact value of 1 divided by 1.602 is approximately 0.6242857, so multiplying by 10^19 gives about 6.242857 \u00d7 10^18.\n\nOption A is 6.25 \u00d7 10^18, which is just a little higher, but given the precision of the given charge value, it's acceptable to choose this option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the charge per electron is given more precisely as 1.60 \u00d7 10^-19 C, in which case:\n\nN = 1 / (1.60 \u00d7 10^-19) = 1 / 0.00000000000000000160 = 1 / 1.60e-19\n\n1 divided by 1.60 is 0.625.\n\nThen, 0.625 \u00d7 10^19 = 6.25 \u00d7 10^18.\n\nAh, that matches option A exactly.\n\nSo, perhaps the charge was given with two significant figures, 1 C, and the elementary charge is 1.60 \u00d7 10^-19 C.\n\nTherefore, the calculation should be:\n\nN = 1 C / (1.60 \u00d7 10^-19 C/electron) = 0.625 \u00d7 10^19 electrons = 6.25 \u00d7 10^18 electrons.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nI should also consider whether the object has any protons or other charged particles, but the problem specifies that it's an object with excess electrons, so I think it's safe to assume that the only charge comes from the excess electrons.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider if there's any induced charge or other effects, but in basic electrostatics, especially at this level, we usually assume that charges are additive and don't interact in complicated ways for this purpose.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 6.25 \u00d7 10^18 electrons, which corresponds to option A.\n\nJust to make sure, let me check the other options quickly.\n\nOption B is 8.00 \u00d7 10^18, which would correspond to 1 C / (1.25 \u00d7 10^-19 C/electron), which doesn't match the known elementary charge.\n\nOption C is 1.60 \u00d7 10^19, which would be 1 C / (0.625 \u00d7 10^-19 C/electron), again not matching the elementary charge.\n\nOption D is 3.20 \u00d7 10^19, which would correspond to 1 C / (0.3125 \u00d7 10^-19 C/electron), which also doesn't align with the known charge of an electron.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
