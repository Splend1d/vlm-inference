                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. There are two situations presented:\n\n**Scenario 1:** \"When my stepmom's hair fell out from chemo, I styled my hair to show her up.\"\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"When my friend told me in private she had a crush, I kept it to myself.\"\n\nSo, the question is asking whether each of these actions is morally wrong or not, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet me consider Scenario 1 first.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the stepmother has lost her hair due to chemotherapy, which is likely a very difficult and emotional time for her. The person in the scenario decides to style their hair to \"show her up.\" Hmm, that sounds insensitive and unempathetic. Chemotherapy is a treatment for cancer, and hair loss can be a significant source of distress for many people going through that experience. It's a vulnerable time, and showing off one's own hair in a way that might make the stepmother feel worse seems callous and lacking in compassion.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to this. Perhaps the person had different intentions. Maybe they thought showing off their hair would make the stepmother feel better by reminding her that beauty comes in many forms. But even then, it seems risky and potentially hurtful. Generally, in situations where someone is going through a tough time, especially due to health issues, it's important to be sensitive and supportive, not to draw attention to oneself in a way that could cause further distress.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, I think styling one's hair to \"show someone up\" who is dealing with hair loss from chemo would be considered morally wrong. It lacks empathy and could cause emotional harm.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2.\n\nIn Scenario 2, a friend tells the person in private that she has a crush, and the person keeps it to themselves. So, the question is whether keeping a friend's secret is morally wrong.\n\nGenerally, keeping secrets is considered a part of respecting someone's privacy and maintaining trust in a friendship. If someone shares something in confidence, it's usually expected that the listener will not share it without permission. Breaking that trust could damage the relationship and harm the person who shared the secret.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions where keeping a secret might be morally questionable, such as if the secret involves harm to oneself or others. For example, if the crush involves someone who is already in a relationship or if there are age differences that make the crush inappropriate, then perhaps the person should consider whether to keep the secret or address the situation differently.\n\nBut in the scenario provided, there's no indication that the crush is on someone unavailable or that it poses any harm. It seems like a straightforward case of a friend sharing a personal secret in confidence, and the listener choosing to respect that confidentiality.\n\nTherefore, under ordinary circumstances, keeping a friend's secret about having a crush is not necessarily morally wrong. It's part of maintaining trust in the friendship.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Styling hair to show up a stepmother who lost her hair from chemo is likely considered morally wrong due to its insensitivity and potential to cause emotional harm.\n\n- Scenario 2: Keeping a friend's secret about having a crush, without any harmful context, is not necessarily morally wrong and is part of respecting privacy and trust in the friendship.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, selecting B. Wrong, Not wrong, would correspond to Scenario 1 being wrong and Scenario 2 being not wrong, which aligns with my earlier analysis.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other perspective that could change this conclusion.\n\nIn Scenario 1, perhaps the person had good intentions, like wanting to make their stepmother feel better by showing that hair isn't everything, or trying to normalize the situation. However, even with good intentions, the action could still be perceived as insensitive, especially if it makes the stepmother feel self-conscious about her appearance during a difficult time.\n\nIn Scenario 2, maybe there's a cultural expectation to share such information with other friends, but generally, respecting someone's request for confidentiality is important unless there's a clear reason to believe that keeping the secret could lead to harm.\n\nOverall, I think my initial assessment stands. Scenario 1 involves a morally wrong action due to its insensitivity towards someone going through a difficult time, while Scenario 2 involves respecting a friend's confidentiality, which is not morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
