                    "text": "Let's tackle this economics problem. So, we've got a situation where the full-employment GDP is $1.3 trillion, and the actual GDP is $1.2 trillion. That means there's a gap of $100 billion between what the economy could produce if everyone who wants a job has one, and what it's actually producing right now. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.8, which means that for every additional dollar of income, people spend 80 cents and save 20 cents.\n\nThe question is, how much should the government spend to close this $100 billion gap and achieve full employment? The options are $100 billion, $80 billion, $20 billion, or $10 billion.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula that relates government spending to the multiplier effect in the economy. I know that when the government spends money, it doesn't all stay in the economy in one place; instead, it gets spent and respent, creating a multiplier effect.\n\nThe formula for the multiplier is 1 / (1 - MPC). Given that MPC is 0.8, the multiplier should be 1 / (1 - 0.8) = 1 / 0.2 = 5.\n\nSo, every dollar of government spending will ultimately lead to a five-dollar increase in total economic activity because of this multiplier effect.\n\nNow, if there's a $100 billion gap to close to reach full employment, I need to figure out how much initial government spending is required to generate that $100 billion in total economic activity.\n\nSince the multiplier is 5, I can set up the equation: government spending \u00d7 multiplier = total increase in GDP needed.\n\nLet's denote government spending as G.\n\nSo, G \u00d7 5 = $100 billion.\n\nTo find G, I divide both sides by 5: G = $100 billion / 5 = $20 billion.\n\nWait a minute, that would suggest the answer is $20 billion, which is option C. But let's double-check because I want to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use the formula for the government spending multiplier directly. The formula is:\n\nChange in GDP = (Multiplier) \u00d7 (Change in Government Spending)\n\nWe need the change in GDP to be $100 billion, and we have the multiplier as 5.\n\nSo, $100 billion = 5 \u00d7 (Change in Government Spending)\n\nSolving for the change in government spending: $100 billion / 5 = $20 billion.\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nBut wait, I should confirm whether the multiplier is indeed 5. Let me verify the calculation for the multiplier.\n\nThe formula for the multiplier is 1 / (1 - MPC).\n\nGiven MPC = 0.8, so 1 - 0.8 = 0.2, and 1 / 0.2 = 5.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? The problem mentions ignoring inflation, so that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nAlso, I should remember that in reality, there might be other considerations like crowding out effects or changes in taxes, but the problem seems to be in a simple Keynesian cross framework, so the multiplier approach should be appropriate.\n\nLet me think about the spending multiplier again. The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is 1 - MPC, which is 0.2. The multiplier is 1 / MPS, which is again 5.\n\nSo, yeah, every dollar of government spending leads to a $5 increase in GDP through the multiplier effect.\n\nTherefore, to close a $100 billion gap, the government needs to spend an additional $20 billion.\n\nWait, but one of the options is $100 billion, which would be like saying if the government spends $100 billion, that directly adds $100 billion to GDP, ignoring the multiplier. But since the multiplier is 5, spending $100 billion should lead to a $500 billion increase in GDP, which is more than needed.\n\nThat doesn't make sense because we only need a $100 billion increase to reach full employment.\n\nSo, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula specifically for calculating the change in GDP due to government spending in this context.\n\nI recall that in the Keynesian model, the government spending multiplier is indeed 1 / (1 - MPC), which is 5 in this case, and that the change in GDP is equal to the multiplier times the change in government spending.\n\nSo, again, that points to $20 billion.\n\nBut let's consider the government spending multiplier formula more carefully.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n\u0394Y = (1 / (1 - MPC)) \u00d7 \u0394G\n\nWhere \u0394Y is the change in GDP, and \u0394G is the change in government spending.\n\nWe need \u0394Y to be $100 billion.\n\nSo,\n\n$100 billion = (1 / (1 - 0.8)) \u00d7 \u0394G\n\n$100 billion = (1 / 0.2) \u00d7 \u0394G\n\n$100 billion = 5 \u00d7 \u0394G\n\nTherefore, \u0394G = $100 billion / 5 = $20 billion.\n\nThis seems consistent every time.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect this calculation.\n\nSuppose that increasing government spending might require raising taxes, which could reduce consumer spending. But the problem doesn't mention any tax changes, so perhaps we can assume that taxes remain constant, and thus the full multiplier effect applies to the change in government spending.\n\nAlternatively, if there are automatic stabilizers or other factors at play, but again, the problem seems to present a straightforward Keynesian model without complications.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the standard Keynesian multiplier model, the answer should be $20 billion.\n\nSo, the correct choice is C. $20 billion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
