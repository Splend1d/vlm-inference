                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a biologist who studied a squirrel population for 15 years. Initially, the population was between 30 and 45 squirrels. Over time, more than half of the squirrels born didn't survive to reproduce due to food competition and predators. But in a single generation, 90% of the born squirrels survived to reproduce, and the population jumped to 80. We need to figure out which inference is true based on this information.\n\nFirst, let's understand the initial situation. The population was stable between 30 and 45 squirrels for 15 years, but in one generation, there was a significant increase to 80. This suggests that something changed in that particular generation to allow more squirrels to survive and reproduce.\n\nOption A says that the amount of available food may have increased. That makes sense because if there's more food, more squirrels can survive, leading to a population increase.\n\nOption B suggests that the number of predators may have decreased. If there are fewer predators, fewer squirrels would be preyed upon, increasing the number of survivors to reproduce.\n\nOption C is a bit more complex. It says that subsequent generations should show greater levels of genetic variation because squirrels that wouldn't have survived in the past are now surviving. So, if more squirrels are surviving to reproduce, that could introduce more genetic variation into the population.\n\nNow, the problem mentions that in this one generation, 90% of the born squirrels lived to reproduce, resulting in a population increase to 80. Previously, over half of the born squirrels did not survive to reproduce due to food competition and predation.\n\nLet me try to make some calculations to understand this better. If the population was around, say, 40 squirrels initially (midway between 30 and 45), and in one generation, 90% of the born squirrels survived to reproduce, leading to 80 squirrels, I need to see how this aligns with the previous situation.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the exact starting number. Let's assume that the starting population was, for example, 40 squirrels. If in one generation, 90% of the born squirrels survived to reproduce, and this led to a population of 80, that suggests a significant increase.\n\nBut I need to think about how populations grow. In a simple model, the population in the next generation is the current population plus the number of offspring that survive to reproduce.\n\nIf, for example, each surviving reproducing squirrel produces a certain number of offspring, and 90% of those offspring survive, that could lead to a population increase.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact reproduction rates or the starting population size, it's hard to do precise calculations. Maybe I don't need exact numbers to answer this question.\n\nLet's consider the options again.\n\nOption A: Increased food availability. If there's more food, that could support a larger population, which aligns with the population increase to 80.\n\nOption B: Decreased predator numbers. Fewer predators mean fewer squirrels are being eaten, so more survive to reproduce, again leading to a population increase.\n\nOption C: Greater genetic variation in subsequent generations. If more squirrels are surviving to reproduce, that could introduce more genetic diversity into the population, especially if those that normally wouldn't survive are now contributing their genes.\n\nGiven that all three options seem plausible reasons for the observed population increase, perhaps the correct answer is D: A, B, and C.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"which inference(s) about this population might be true?\" It's using \"might\" which suggests possibility rather than certainty.\n\nSo, it's possible that A, B, or C could be true based on the information provided.\n\nHowever, maybe there's more to consider. Perhaps one of these options is less likely than the others.\n\nLet me think about the context again. The population was stable for 15 years between 30 and 45 squirrels, with over half of the born squirrels not surviving to reproduce due to food competition and predation. Then, in one generation, 90% survived to reproduce, and the population jumped to 80.\n\nThis suggests that something changed in that generation to allow a higher survival rate of the born squirrels.\n\nPossible explanations are:\n\n1. Increased food availability (Option A), which reduces competition and increases survival rates.\n\n2. Decreased predator pressure (Option B), leading to fewer deaths from predation.\n\n3. A combination of both.\n\nNow, Option C suggests increased genetic variation in subsequent generations because more squirrels are surviving to reproduce. This could be a consequence of either increased food or decreased predators, as both would lead to higher survival rates and thus more varied genetic contributions to the next generation.\n\nTherefore, all three options could be true inferences based on the observed population increase.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way to look at this. Maybe not all three have to be true; maybe just one or two are sufficient explanations.\n\nWait, but the question is \"which inference(s) might be true,\" meaning possible explanations, not necessarily all of them being true simultaneously.\n\nGiven that, it's possible that any one of A, B, or C could be true, or any combination of them, based on the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the most comprehensive answer would be D: A, B, and C, meaning all three inferences could be true.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to choose among A, B, and C individually, I might consider that both A and B could directly lead to higher survival rates and population increases, while C is a potential consequence of higher survival rates.\n\nBut since the question allows for \"which inference(s) might be true,\" and all three seem plausible, D is the best answer.\n\nI think the answer is D: A, B, and C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
