There are four options, and I need to pick the false one. Let me read them again to make sure I understand.\n\nOption A says: \"In the 1990's it became apparent the European Court of Human Rights had to be reformed because it wasn't examining enough cases.\"\n\nOption B: \"In the 1990's it became apparent the European Court of Human Rights had to be reformed because the workload had increased.\"\n\nOption C: \"In the 1990's it became apparent the European Court of Human Rights had to be reformed because it was a part-time court that could not process the growing number of complaints.\"\n\nOption D: \"In the 1990's it became apparent the European Court of Human Rights had to be reformed because of the growth in the number of individuals who could access the Court after the increase in the number of member states.\"\n\nAlright, so all of these seem related to increases in workload or changes in how the court operates. I need to recall some history about the European Court of Human Rights in the 1990s.\n\nFirst, I know that the European Court of Human Rights is based in Strasbourg, France, and it's established by the European Convention on Human Rights. It's responsible for ensuring that the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention are respected by the member states.\n\nNow, in the 1990s, there were significant changes in Europe, especially with the fall of the Soviet Union and the reunification of Germany. This led to an expansion of the Council of Europe, which oversees the European Convention on Human Rights, and thus more member states meant potentially more individuals who could bring cases to the court.\n\nI think Option D is referring to this expansion of member states, which increased the number of people who could access the court. That sounds plausible, but is it the reason for reform?\n\nOption B mentions an increase in workload. That also seems likely, as more member states would probably lead to more cases being brought before the court.\n\nOption C says it was a part-time court that couldn't handle the growing number of complaints. Hmm, I thought the European Court of Human Rights was a full-time court, but maybe in the 1990s, its operations weren't as robust as they are now.\n\nOption A says it wasn't examining enough cases. That seems a bit vague. Maybe it's suggesting that the court was backlogged and couldn't get to all the cases it should have.\n\nI need to find out what actually led to the reform of the European Court of Human Rights in the 1990s.\n\nLet me think about this. The European Convention on Human Rights was originally drafted in the 1950s, and the court was established in 1959. With the Cold War ending and the expansion of the Council of Europe, there must have been pressures on the court's capacity.\n\nI recall that the court used to have a system where cases were heard by a smaller chamber, and only important cases went to a larger chamber or the full court. Maybe that system wasn't sufficient with the increased volume of cases.\n\nAlso, there might have been issues with the efficiency of the court's procedures, leading to delays in processing cases.\n\nLet me consider each option again in light of this background.\n\nOption A: It wasn't examining enough cases. This could be interpreted as the court having a backlog or being unable to handle the volume of cases, which seems possible.\n\nOption B: Workload had increased. This is straightforward and aligns with the idea that more member states meant more potential cases.\n\nOption C: It was a part-time court. I thought the European Court of Human Rights was always a full-time court, but maybe in its early days, it wasn't as fully staffed or operational year-round. Perhaps in the 1990s, it became clear that it needed to be a full-time operation to handle the caseload.\n\nOption D: Growth in the number of individuals who could access the court after an increase in member states. This seems directly related to the expansion of the Council of Europe, which did occur in the 1990s with countries from Eastern Europe joining.\n\nWait a minute, I should check when the Council of Europe expanded. I believe that after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, several Eastern European countries joined the Council of Europe, which would have increased the potential pool of individuals who could bring cases to the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nSo, Option D seems accurate.\n\nOption C mentions that it was a part-time court. I'm a bit skeptical about that. I thought the court always had full-time judges, but maybe their sessions weren't continuous before the 1990s.\n\nLet me see if I can find some information about the court's structure in the 1990s.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that the European Court of Human Rights was indeed established as a full-time court in 1959, but its sessions may not have been continuous, and it might have had limitations in its ability to handle a large number of cases efficiently.\n\nIn fact, prior to the 1990s, the court had a system where cases were first examined by a commission, which would filter out inadmissible or manifestly ill-founded cases before they reached the court.\n\nWith the expansion of the Council of Europe, the number of applications skyrocketed, overwhelming the existing system.\n\nSo, perhaps the court itself was full-time, but the system as a whole wasn't designed to handle the increased volume.\n\nGiven that, Option C might be misleading because the court was full-time, but the overall system might have been part-time in its operations or in its ability to process cases efficiently.\n\nOption A says it wasn't examining enough cases, which could be because of the backlog caused by the increased workload.\n\nOption B directly states that the workload had increased, which is likely due to the factors mentioned in Option D.\n\nSo, perhaps Option C is the false statement because the court was full-time, but the system may have had part-time elements or wasn't designed for high volumes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the court was sitting only part of the year, and reforms made it sit more frequently or continuously.\n\nI need to verify this.\n\nUpon further research, I find that prior to the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 to the European Convention on Human Rights in 1998, the court's jurisdiction and procedures were different. The 1998 reforms made the court a full-time institution with increased capacity to handle the growing number of applications.\n\nSo, before 1998, the court may not have been sitting continuously, and its procedures might have been less efficient for handling a large number of cases.\n\nTherefore, Option C might be partially accurate, but it's phrased as \"it was a part-time court,\" which could be misleading. The court might have had full-time judges but part-time sessions, or perhaps its operations weren't fully scaled up to handle the increased caseload.\n\nGiven that, I think Option C is the false statement because the court was always a full-time institution, even if its procedures or session times needed improvement to handle the increased workload.\n\nTo confirm, the European Court of Human Rights was established as a full-time court in 1959, but with the expansion of the Council of Europe in the 1990s, it became apparent that reforms were needed to enhance its capacity and efficiency.\n\nTherefore, statements A, B, and D are true, as they accurately reflect the reasons for reform: increased workload due to more member states and more individuals able to access the court, leading to a backlog of cases that the court wasn't examining promptly.\n\nStatement C is false because the court was not a part-time court; it was a full-time court that needed reforms to improve its ability to handle a larger number of cases efficiently.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
