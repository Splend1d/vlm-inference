                    "text": "So I have this question about uniform circular motion, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that the centrifugal force is the action-reaction pair of the centripetal force. Hmm, I remember that in uniform circular motion, there's a centripetal force that acts towards the center, causing the object to follow a circular path. But what about centrifugal force? I think centrifugal force is sometimes considered a fictitious force, like in rotating reference frames. Maybe it's not the action-reaction pair of centripetal force. Let me think again.\n\nOption B says that the centripetal acceleration and velocity point in the same direction. I know that velocity is tangent to the path of the object, and centripetal acceleration points towards the center. So, they are perpendicular to each other, right? Not in the same direction. So, this can't be true.\n\nOption C says that the velocity of the object changes, whereas the acceleration is constant. Wait, in uniform circular motion, the speed is constant, but the direction of velocity changes because the object is moving in a circle. The acceleration, which is centripetal acceleration, has a constant magnitude but changes direction as the object moves. So, is the acceleration constant? I think only its magnitude is constant, but its direction changes. So, perhaps this statement isn't entirely accurate.\n\nOption D says that a satellite undergoing uniform circular motion is falling toward the center in a circular path. This sounds familiar. Like how planets orbit the sun or moons orbit planets because the gravitational force is pulling them towards the center, causing them to follow a circular path. So, in a way, they are continuously falling towards the center but moving forward at such a speed that they go around in a circle.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- A: Centrifugal force isn't the action-reaction pair of centripetal force. Maybe it's a misunderstanding.\n\n- B: Centripetal acceleration and velocity don't point in the same direction; they are perpendicular.\n\n- C: Velocity changes direction, but acceleration changes direction too, so it's not constant.\n\n- D: Satellites are falling towards the center in a circular path, which seems correct.\n\nSo, based on this, option D seems to be the true statement.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about option C again. It says that velocity changes while acceleration is constant. In uniform circular motion, the velocity does change because the direction changes, even though the speed is constant. The acceleration is centripetal acceleration, which has a constant magnitude but changes direction as the object moves in the circle. So, acceleration is not constant because its direction changes. Therefore, option C is not entirely accurate.\n\nOption D, on the other hand, accurately describes that in uniform circular motion, like a satellite orbiting Earth, the satellite is being pulled towards the center by gravity, causing it to follow a circular path. So, yes, it's essentially falling towards the center but moving forward at a speed that keeps it in orbit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
