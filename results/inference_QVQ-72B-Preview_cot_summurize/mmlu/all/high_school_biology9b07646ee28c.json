                    "text": "Okay, so I have this question about the digestive system. It's asking which one of these organs doesn't secrete digestive enzymes: the mouth, the stomach, the gall bladder, or the small intestine. Hmm, I need to recall what each of these organs does.\n\nStarting with the mouth: I know that digestion begins here, right? When we chew our food, enzymes in our saliva start breaking down carbohydrates. So, the mouth does secrete digestive enzymes, specifically salivary amylase. So, option A, the mouth, does secrete digestive enzymes.\n\nNext is the stomach. The stomach secretes gastric juice, which contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. Pepsin is an enzyme that helps break down proteins. So, the stomach also secretes digestive enzymes. That would make option B, the stomach, not the correct answer.\n\nThen there's the gall bladder. I remember that the gall bladder stores and releases bile into the small intestine. Bile helps emulsify fats, making them easier to digest. But does bile contain digestive enzymes? I think not. Bile is mainly composed of bile salts, cholesterol, and phospholipids. It doesn't have enzymes; those are more related to breaking down macronutrients like proteins, carbohydrates, and fats chemically.\n\nWait, but maybe there are enzymes in bile? Let me think carefully. No, I don't think so. Bile is more about emulsifying fats, not directly breaking them down with enzymes. So, perhaps the gall bladder is the one that doesn't secrete digestive enzymes.\n\nLastly, the small intestine. This is where most of the digestion and absorption happen. The small intestine secretes intestinal juice, which contains various enzymes like lactase, sucrase, maltase for carbohydrates, peptidases for proteins, and lipases for fats. So, definitely, the small intestine secretes digestive enzymes.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Mouth: secretes salivary amylase (enzyme)\n\n- Stomach: secretes pepsin (enzyme)\n\n- Gall bladder: secretes bile, which does not contain enzymes\n\n- Small intestine: secretes multiple enzymes\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C, the gall bladder, because it does not secrete digestive enzymes.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check. Is there any chance that bile contains enzymes? I don't think so. Bile is primarily for emulsifying fats, which is a physical process, not a chemical one like enzyme-catalyzed reactions.\n\nYeah, I'm pretty confident with this answer. So, the final answer is C, the gall bladder.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
