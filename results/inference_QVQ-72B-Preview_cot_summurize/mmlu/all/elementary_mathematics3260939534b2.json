                    "text": "So I have this expression: -2(x - 3), and I need to evaluate it for x = 2. Let's see, I should plug in 2 for x and then simplify step by step.\n\nFirst, replace x with 2: -2(2 - 3). Okay, now I need to do the operation inside the parentheses. 2 minus 3 is... hmm, that's negative, right? Yeah, 2 - 3 equals -1.\n\nSo now I have -2 times -1. I remember that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result. So, -2 times -1 should be +2.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should consider the order of operations here. Is there any other operation besides multiplication and subtraction? No, just subtraction inside the parentheses and then multiplication outside.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to distribute the -2 over the terms inside the parentheses. So, -2 times x plus -2 times -3. If x is 2, then it's -2 times 2 plus -2 times -3. That would be -4 plus 6, which is also 2.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. But let me see if there's another way to look at it, just to be sure.\n\nMaybe I can think about the expression without the coefficient in front. First, find x - 3, which is 2 - 3 = -1. Then, multiply that by -2. Again, -2 times -1 is +2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can visualize this on a number line. Starting at x = 2, subtract 3 to get to -1, and then multiply by -2. Multiplying by -2 would flip the sign and scale the magnitude, turning -1 into +2.\n\nI think I'm consistent across different methods, all pointing to the answer being 2. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any potential mistake I might be making.\n\nOne common mistake is misapplying the distributive property with negative signs. Let's see: -2(x - 3) could be thought of as -1 times 2 times (x - 3). But that seems more complicated, and I don't think it's necessary here.\n\nAnother potential pitfall is forgetting that subtracting a larger number from a smaller one gives a negative result, which I accounted for when finding x - 3 = -1.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I'm handling the multiplication of negative numbers correctly. I know that the product of two negatives is positive, so -2 times -1 should indeed be +2.\n\nLet me consider if the expression could be interpreted differently. Is there any ambiguity in how the expression is written? For example, could the \"-2(x - 3)\" be misread as \"-2x - 3\" or something else? No, I think it's clear as written.\n\nJust to be extra sure, perhaps I can plug in the value into all the options provided and see which one matches the calculation.\n\nOption A: -4. If the answer were -4, that would mean -2 times -1 equals -4, which isn't correct because multiplying two negatives gives a positive.\n\nOption B: -2. That would require -2 times -1 to be -2, which is also incorrect for the same reason.\n\nOption C: 10. That seems too large. If I multiply -2 and -1, I get 2, not 10.\n\nOption D: 2. This matches my calculations.\n\nI think I've covered all possible ways to approach this problem, and each time I end up with 2 as the correct answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct choice is option D: 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
