                    "text": "So I'm reading this question about Ronald Dworkin and his endorsement of \"Hume's principle\" in his book \"Justice for Hedgehogs.\" The options are:\n\nA. That there is no distinction between law and morality.\n\nB. That there is a distinction between right and wrong.\n\nC. That facts about the world or human nature cannot normally ordain what ought to be.\n\nD. That human rights are fundamentally unsound.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what Hume's principle is and how Dworkin interprets it. I know that David Hume, the Scottish philosopher, made a famous distinction between statements of fact and statements of value. His principle is often summarized as \"you can't derive an 'ought' from an 'is'.\" In other words, just because something is a certain way doesn't mean it ought to be that way.\n\nSo, Hume was cautioning against moving from descriptive statements to prescriptive statements without proper justification. This is known as the is-ought problem.\n\nNow, Dworkin is a legal philosopher who has written extensively on law, morality, and political philosophy. In \"Justice for Hedgehogs,\" he delves into questions of morality and the nature of value.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. That there is no distinction between law and morality.\n\nThis seems contrary to Hume's principle because Hume was highlighting a distinction between facts (is) and values (ought), which can relate to both law and morality. Dworkin is known for arguing that law and morality are distinct, though interconnected. So, this option doesn't seem to align with Hume's principle as understood through Dworkin.\n\nB. That there is a distinction between right and wrong.\n\nThis is a bit too vague. While Hume's principle does touch on the distinction between facts and values, which could include right and wrong, this option doesn't capture the essence of the principle.\n\nC. That facts about the world or human nature cannot normally ordain what ought to be.\n\nThis sounds very much like Hume's principle. It's saying that factual knowledge alone isn't sufficient to derive moral obligations or prescriptions. This aligns well with the idea that you can't get an 'ought' from an 'is.'\n\nD. That human rights are fundamentally unsound.\n\nThis seems unrelated to Hume's principle. Hume's principle is about the relationship between facts and values, not specifically about human rights.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C seems to be the most accurate representation of Hume's principle as endorsed by Dworkin.\n\nBut let me double-check. I recall that in \"Justice for Hedgehogs,\" Dworkin discusses the importance of distinguishing between what is and what ought to be. He emphasizes that facts about the world don't directly tell us what we ought to do; rather, moral reasoning is required to bridge that gap.\n\nMoreover, Dworkin argues against the idea that moral truths can be derived solely from facts about human nature or the world. He believes that moral truths are objective but require interpretation and reasoning beyond just empirical observation.\n\nTherefore, endorsing Hume's principle would mean that Dworkin agrees that facts don't directly prescribe moral obligations. This aligns perfectly with option C: that facts about the world or human nature cannot normally ordain what ought to be.\n\nTo make sure I'm not missing something, I'll consider if any of the other options could be interpreted in a way that fits Dworkin's view.\n\nOption A suggests that there is no distinction between law and morality. However, Dworkin is known for his theory of law as integrity, which holds that law and morality are distinct but interconnected domains. He argues that judges should interpret the law in light of moral principles, but he doesn't say that law and morality are the same thing. Therefore, this option doesn't seem correct.\n\nOption B states that there is a distinction between right and wrong. While Dworkin certainly believes in objective moral truths and the distinction between right and wrong, this option doesn't capture the specific content of Hume's principle.\n\nOption D claims that human rights are fundamentally unsound. This contradicts Dworkin's views, as he is a strong advocate for human rights and has written extensively on their importance and foundation.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, I conclude that option C is the correct answer: that facts about the world or human nature cannot normally ordain what ought to be. This accurately reflects Dworkin's endorsement of Hume's principle in \"Justice for Hedgehogs.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
