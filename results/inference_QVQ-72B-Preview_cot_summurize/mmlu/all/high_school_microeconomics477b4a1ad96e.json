                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem about Mrs. Johnson and her spending on potato chips and onion dip. She's spending her whole budget on these two items, with chips costing $1 each and dip costing $2 each. Her current marginal utility for chips is 12 and for dip is 30. I need to figure out what she should do to maximize her utility.\n\nFirst, I remember that to maximize utility, the marginal utility per dollar should be the same for both goods. So, for chips and dip, the ratio of marginal utility to price should be equal.\n\nThe formula for that is:\n\nMU_chips / P_chips = MU_dip / P_dip\n\nPlugging in the values I have:\n\n12 / 1 = 30 / 2\n\nLet's calculate both sides:\n\nLeft side: 12 divided by 1 is 12\n\nRight side: 30 divided by 2 is 15\n\nSo, 12 \u2260 15, which means her current consumption isn't optimal. She should adjust her consumption to make these equal.\n\nSo, option A is wrong because she shouldn't do nothing; she needs to adjust her consumption.\n\nNow, I need to think about whether she should consume more or less of chips and dip.\n\nSince the marginal utility per dollar for dip is higher (15 vs. 12 for chips), she gets more utility per dollar spent on dip compared to chips. So, she should probably consume more dip and less chips to equalize the marginal utility per dollar.\n\nBut wait, let's think about this more carefully.\n\nThe general rule is that to maximize utility, a consumer should allocate their budget such that the last dollar spent on each good provides the same amount of marginal utility.\n\nSo, if MU_chips / P_chips < MU_dip / P_dip, then she should shift spending from chips to dip.\n\nBut let's look at the options again:\n\nB. increase her consumption of chips until the marginal utility of chip consumption equals 30.\n\nC. decrease her consumption of chips until the marginal utility of chip consumption equals 30.\n\nD. decrease her consumption of chips and increase her consumption of dip until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both goods.\n\nOption D seems to align with what I just thought. But let's make sure.\n\nIf she buys more dip and less chips, she would expect the marginal utility of dip to decrease (due to diminishing marginal utility) and the marginal utility of chips to increase.\n\nSo, by buying more dip and less chips, she should be able to equalize the marginal utility per dollar spent on both goods.\n\nBut option B suggests increasing consumption of chips until its marginal utility equals 30. That doesn't seem right because if she buys more chips, the marginal utility decreases, but in this case, the MU of chips is already 12, and she would need it to go up to 30, which isn't possible without changing her consumption.\n\nOption C says decrease consumption of chips until MU of chips equals 30. If she buys less chips, MU of chips would increase, but she would also be spending less on chips, so her budget allocation changes.\n\nBut I think option D is the best answer because it suggests adjusting consumption of both goods to equalize the marginal utility per dollar.\n\nLet me check the math.\n\nCurrently:\n\nMU_chips = 12\n\nP_chips = $1\n\nMU_dip = 30\n\nP_dip = $2\n\nSo, MU_chips / P_chips = 12 / 1 = 12\n\nMU_dip / P_dip = 30 / 2 = 15\n\nTo maximize utility, she needs both to be equal. So, she should adjust her consumption until:\n\nMU_chips / 1 = MU_dip / 2\n\nLet's say she buys fewer chips and more dip.\n\nAs she buys fewer chips, MU_chips increases, and as she buys more dip, MU_dip decreases.\n\nShe should keep adjusting until both ratios are equal.\n\nSo, yes, option D seems correct.\n\nWait, but option C says decrease consumption of chips until MU_chips = 30.\n\nIf MU_chips = 30 and P_chips = $1, then MU_chips / P_chips = 30 / 1 = 30\n\nAnd MU_dip / P_dip = 30 / 2 = 15\n\nSo, 30 \u2260 15, which is not equal.\n\nTherefore, option C is incorrect because even if MU_chips = 30, it doesn't equalize the marginal utility per dollar.\n\nSimilarly, option B suggests increasing consumption of chips until MU_chips = 30, which would make MU_chips / P_chips = 30 / 1 = 30, again not equal to MU_dip / P_dip = 15.\n\nSo, neither B nor C is correct.\n\nOption D is the only one that suggests adjusting both goods to equalize the marginal utility per dollar.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
