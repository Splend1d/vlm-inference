I remember that in hypothesis testing, there are two types of errors: Type I and Type II. Type I error is when you incorrectly reject the null hypothesis, and Type II error is when you fail to reject the null hypothesis even though it's false. So, let's look at each option:\n\nA. It is the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis.\n\nWait, no, that sounds like a Type I error. Type I error is about incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true. So, this seems to be describing alpha, the significance level, not the Type II error.\n\nB. It is equivalent to the power of the test.\n\nHmm, I think the power of the test is actually the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it's false. That's 1 minus the probability of a Type II error. So, it's the opposite of the Type II error, not equivalent to it.\n\nC. It is equivalent to the size of the test.\n\nThe size of the test is usually referred to as the significance level, which is the probability of a Type I error. That's different from the Type II error, which is the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it's false.\n\nD. It is the probability of failing to reject a null hypothesis that was wrong.\n\nThis seems to align with the definition of a Type II error. It's about not rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually false. So, this appears to be the correct description of a Type II error.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something. Type II error is indeed the probability of failing to detect an effect that is actually present, which is essentially failing to reject the null hypothesis when it's wrong. So, option D seems to be the best description among the given choices.\n\nI think the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
