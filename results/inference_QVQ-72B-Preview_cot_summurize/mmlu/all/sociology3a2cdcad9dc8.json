                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which sociological perspective views society as a system of interdependent and coordinated parts. The options are functionalism, conflict theory, symbolic interactionism, and role theory. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what each of these perspectives emphasizes. Starting with functionalism, I recall that it sees society as a complex system whose parts work together to promote solidarity and stability. It's kind of like a machine where each component has a function and contributes to the overall operation of the whole. So, in that sense, it sounds like functionalism emphasizes interdependence and coordination among social institutions or parts of society.\n\nNow, moving on to conflict theory. I know that this perspective focuses on the struggles between different social groups over scarce resources, power, and other inequalities. It suggests that society is characterized by conflict and competition rather than harmony and cooperation. So, unlike functionalism, which sees society as cohesive, conflict theory highlights discord and tension. Therefore, it doesn't view society as a system of interdependent and coordinated parts in the same way.\n\nNext is symbolic interactionism. This perspective is more micro-level, concentrating on how individuals interact and interpret symbols and meanings in their daily lives. It's about the social construction of reality and how people make sense of their world through communication and interpretation. While it does involve coordination in interactions, it's not primarily about the society as a whole system of interdependent parts. So, probably not the best fit for the description in the question.\n\nLastly, there's role theory. This approach looks at how individuals adopt and perform social roles in their lives. Social roles are patterns of behavior expected of someone occupying a given position in a social structure. Role theory emphasizes how these roles guide behavior and shape social relationships. While roles can be interdependent\u2014like in a workplace where different roles complement each other\u2014it's more about individual behavior and less about the society as a whole system of coordinated parts.\n\nConsidering all this, functionalism seems to be the most appropriate choice. It explicitly views society as a system where various parts work together harmoniously, each serving a function that contributes to the stability and continuity of the whole. The other perspectives don't emphasize this systemic, interdependent view to the same extent.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think about it another way. If I imagine society as a body, functionalism would be like saying each organ has a specific function and works together to keep the body healthy. Conflict theory would be more about the organs fighting over resources, symbolic interactionism would be about how cells communicate with each other, and role theory would be about the roles different cells play in the body's functioning.\n\nSo, yeah, I think functionalism is the correct answer here because it directly sees society as a system of interdependent and coordinated parts, each serving a particular function.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Functionalism}} \\]"
