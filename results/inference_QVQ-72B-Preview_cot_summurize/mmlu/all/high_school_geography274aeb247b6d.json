                    "text": "So I have this question about migration theories, and it's asking who proposed the idea that most migration happens over short distances and in steps. The options are Rostow, Ravenstein, von Th\u00fcnen, and Burgess. Hmm, I need to recall what each of these theorists is known for.\n\nStarting with Rostow, I remember he developed the Stage's of Economic Growth model, which talks about how countries develop through different stages, like traditional society, takeoff, and so on. But that seems more related to economic development rather than migration. So, probably not the right choice here.\n\nNext is Ravenstein. I think he did some early work on migration. Let me see... Ravenstein's Laws of Migration, I believe. One of his laws was that most migrants don't move very far; they tend to move shorter distances, often in a series of steps. That sounds promising. So, maybe he's the one who proposed this idea.\n\nThen there's von Th\u00fcnen. He's known for the von Th\u00fcnen model, which is about agricultural land use around cities, with different types of crops and farming methods based on distance from the market. That's more about land use and agriculture, not directly about migration. So, probably not the answer here.\n\nLastly, Burgess. I think he developed the concentric zone model of urban structure, which describes how cities grow in rings with different zones for things like the central business district, working-class housing, and so on. Again, that's more about urban geography and less about migration patterns.\n\nSo, based on what I recall, Ravenstein is the one who proposed that most migration occurs over short distances and in steps. His laws of migration include observations like migrants prefer shorter distances because they are less risky and more familiar. So, I think the answer should be B. Ravenstein.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. Rostow was about economic growth stages, von Th\u00fcnen about agricultural land use, Burgess about urban structure, and Ravenstein about migration patterns. Yeah, seems like Ravenstein is the correct choice for this particular theory about migration distances.\n\nI think I've got it right. If not, I might need to brush up on my migration theories, but for now, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
