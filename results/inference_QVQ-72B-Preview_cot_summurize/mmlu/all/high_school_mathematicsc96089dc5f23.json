                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Patricia starts with an annual salary of $20,000. After one year, her salary increases by 10%. Then, after her second year, it increases by another 10% based on her previous year's salary. We need to find out what her salary will be after these two years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the salary increases work. The first increase is 10% after one year. So, starting from $20,000, a 10% increase would be $2,000 (because 10% of $20,000 is $2,000). So, her salary after the first year would be $20,000 plus $2,000, which is $22,000.\n\nNow, for the second year, her salary increases by 10% more over the previous year's salary. So, the increase is again 10%, but this time it's based on her salary after the first increase, which is $22,000.\n\nLet me calculate 10% of $22,000. 10% of $22,000 is $2,200. So, her salary after the second year would be $22,000 plus $2,200, which is $24,200.\n\nLooking back at the options, $24,200 is option A.\n\nWait a minute, option B is $24,000, which might be a common mistake if someone added 10% twice but didn't compound it correctly. But since we're dealing with percentage increases on the new salary each time, the correct answer should indeed be $24,200.\n\nOption C is $22,000, which is her salary after the first year, but the question asks for her salary after two years, so that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption D is $4,000, which seems too low compared to the starting salary of $20,000, so that can't be right.\n\nSo, based on this calculation, the correct answer should be option A: $24,200.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting salary: $20,000. After first year, 10% increase: $20,000 + $2,000 = $22,000. After second year, another 10% increase on $22,000: $2,200. Total salary after two years: $22,000 + $2,200 = $24,200. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of a compound interest formula. The salary increases by 10% each year, so after one year, it's $20,000 * 1.10 = $22,000. After the second year, it's $22,000 * 1.10 = $24,200. Same result.\n\nI don't think there's any other way to interpret the problem. The key is to apply the percentage increase to the new salary each time, not just adding 10% of the original salary twice.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is option A: $24,200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 24200} \\]"
