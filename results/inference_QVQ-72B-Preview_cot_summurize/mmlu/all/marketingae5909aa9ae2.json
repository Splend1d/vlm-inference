Forecast total market potential.\n\nC. Forecast market share.\n\nD. Select target market segments.\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nMarket segmentation is the process of dividing a broad consumer or business market into subsets of consumers based on some common traits. So, before even starting this process, what should the firm have done?\n\nOption A says \"identify bases for segmenting markets.\" That sounds like something you'd do as part of the segmentation process, not necessarily before it. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nOption B is \"forecast total market potential.\" This seems like understanding the overall size of the market. Maybe that's something you should know before you start segmenting it. If you don't know how big the market is, maybe you can't effectively decide how to divide it.\n\nOption C is \"forecast market share.\" Market share is the percentage of total sales within a particular market that a company holds. Again, this seems like something you'd want to know after you've segmented the market and chosen a target segment.\n\nOption D is \"select target market segments.\" This definitely seems like something you do during or after the segmentation process, not before.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to consider the sequence of steps in market segmentation.\n\nI recall that the general steps are:\n\n1. Identify the market.\n\n2. Segment the market.\n\n3. Select target segments.\n\n4. Position the product or service within the selected segments.\n\nSo, in this sequence, identifying the market comes before segmenting it.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Identify bases for segmenting markets.\n\nB. Forecast total market potential.\n\nC. Forecast market share.\n\nD. Select target market segments.\n\nOption B, forecasting total market potential, seems to align with identifying the overall market size, which is necessary before you start segmenting it.\n\nLet me see if I can find some reference to confirm this.\n\nI found that market potential analysis is often conducted to estimate the maximum possible sales for a product or service in a particular market over a specified period. This analysis helps in understanding the total opportunity available in the market.\n\nSegmentation, on the other hand, is about dividing this market into smaller, more manageable groups based on shared characteristics, such as demographics, behavior, or needs.\n\nSo, logically, you'd want to know the total market potential before you start dividing it into segments.\n\nForecasting market share (option C) typically comes after you've determined your target segments and decided on your marketing strategy.\n\nSelecting target market segments (option D) is indeed a step in the process, but it comes after segmenting the market, not before.\n\nIdentifying bases for segmenting markets (option A) is part of the segmentation process itself, where you decide on the criteria to divide the market.\n\nTherefore, among the given options, forecasting total market potential (option B) seems to be the most appropriate answer.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it.\n\nI found another perspective that suggests that before segmenting the market, a firm should have a clear understanding of customer needs and the benefits they seek from the product or service. This understanding helps in identifying relevant segmentation variables.\n\nSo, perhaps identifying bases for segmenting markets (option A) is also crucial before starting the segmentation process.\n\nLet me think about this again.\n\nIf I consider that identifying the bases for segmentation is a preliminary step to actually performing the segmentation, then yes, it comes before the actual segmentation process.\n\nHowever, in the context of the question, which asks what a firm should do \"before beginning the market segmentation process,\" both identifying bases for segmentation and forecasting total market potential seem important.\n\nBut if I have to choose one among the options, and considering the sequence of steps in strategic marketing planning, I think forecasting total market potential is a more fundamental step that precedes segmentation.\n\nThis is because understanding the overall market size helps in allocating resources effectively and justifying the effort put into segmentation.\n\nMoreover, knowing the total market potential can influence how deeply or coarsely you segment the market.\n\nFor example, if the market is very large, you might want to segment it more finely to target specific groups effectively, whereas if it's smaller, broader segmentation might be more appropriate.\n\nTherefore, I believe that forecasting total market potential is something a firm should do before beginning the market segmentation process.\n\nTo sum it up, the correct answer should be B. Forecast total market potential.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
