                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Nussbaum's view on ethical inquiry, specifically regarding virtues. The question is: Nussbaum claims that at the first stage of ethical inquiry, terms for the virtues should be...\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. as descriptive as possible.\n\nB. those that are conventionally used.\n\nC. neutral between competing specifications of the virtue.\n\nD. none of the above.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall what Nussbaum says about ethical inquiry and virtues. I know that Nussbaum is a prominent figure in contemporary ethics, particularly known for her work in moral philosophy and political philosophy, often drawing on ancient philosophy, especially Aristotle.\n\nShe talks about ethical inquiry having stages. The first stage is, I think, about establishing a general understanding of virtues before delving into more specific or contested definitions. So, in this initial phase, she probably suggests using terms that are broadly acceptable or neutral among different interpretations of what a virtue is.\n\nLet me think about option C: neutral between competing specifications of the virtue. This seems plausible. If you're starting an ethical inquiry, you might want to use terms that don't favor one particular understanding of a virtue over another right off the bat. That way, you can build a foundation that various perspectives can agree on before exploring differences.\n\nOption A says as descriptive as possible. While description is important in ethics to understand what we're talking about, maybe at the first stage, it's more about using terms that are widely\u8ba4\u53efd or neutrally defined rather than being overly descriptive, which could bias towards a particular view.\n\nOption B is those that are conventionally used. Convention can be important because it relates to how people generally understand terms in a particular society or context. However, relying solely on conventional usage might not capture the full meaning or the ethical significance of a virtue, especially if different groups have different conventions.\n\nGiven that, option C seems more appealing because it suggests using terms that don't take sides in debates about what exactly constitutes a virtue. It's like setting a common ground before diving into disagreements.\n\nBut let me consider all options again to make sure. If terms are to be as descriptive as possible (option A), that might lead to incorporating specific characteristics that not everyone agrees on at the early stage of inquiry. So, perhaps it's better to start with more general or neutral descriptions.\n\nOption B, using conventionally used terms, might reflect common practice, but ethics often aims to go beyond mere convention to understand what is truly good or virtuous. So, perhaps relying solely on conventional usage isn't sufficient for ethical inquiry.\n\nOption C, being neutral between competing specifications, aligns with the idea of starting with a common denominator. This way, different perspectives can be considered without presupposing one definition over another.\n\nI think the answer is C. neutral between competing specifications of the virtue.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any possibility that another option could be correct. Maybe Nussbaum emphasizes descriptive terms to ensure clarity from the start. But no, I think neutrality is more important at the initial stage to avoid bias.\n\nOption D is none of the above, but since I believe C is the correct choice, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
