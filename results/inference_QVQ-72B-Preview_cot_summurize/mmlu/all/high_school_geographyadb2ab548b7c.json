Veda.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one is the sacred book of Hinduism.\n\nFirst off, I know that Hinduism is a religion that originated in India, and it has a lot of different texts and scriptures. But which one is considered their main sacred book?\n\nLet me think about this. I've heard of the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads; are those considered the main sacred books? Or is there something else?\n\nWait, looking at the options:\n\nA. Talmud \u2013 That's part of Judaism, right? I think the Talmud is a collection of Jewish laws and teachings. So, that doesn't seem right for Hinduism.\n\nB. Bible \u2013 That's the holy book of Christianity and Judaism. Definitely not Hinduism.\n\nC. Torah \u2013 That's another Jewish text, the first part of the Hebrew Bible. Again, not related to Hinduism.\n\nD. Veda \u2013 Now, this rings a bell. I think the Vedas are ancient sacred texts of Hinduism. There are four Vedas, and they contain hymns and mantras that are still used in Hindu rituals today.\n\nYes, that seems to make sense. So, the Veda is one of the primary sacred texts in Hinduism. But just to be sure, maybe I should double-check.\n\nI recall that the Vedas are the oldest scriptures in Hinduism, composed in Vedic Sanskrit. They cover a wide range of topics, from rituals to philosophy. And they're still highly revered in Hindu tradition.\n\nOn the other hand, the Bhagavad Gita is also a very important text in Hinduism, but it's part of the Mahabharata, which is a larger epic. So, while it's significant, it's not the primary sacred book in the same way the Vedas are.\n\nThe Upanishads are another key part of Hindu scriptures, and they're actually part of the Vedas, specifically the philosophical teachings that came after the hymns.\n\nSo, among the options given, D. Veda is the correct choice for the sacred book of Hinduism.\n\nJust to make sure there isn't something I'm missing, maybe I should consider if there's a single, unified sacred book in Hinduism, like the Bible in Christianity or the Quran in Islam.\n\nActually, Hinduism doesn't have one single sacred book. It has a vast body of literature, including the Vedas, Smriti texts like the Mahabharata and Ramayana, and philosophical texts like the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nBut if I had to pick one from the options, Veda is indeed the most appropriate choice for a sacred book of Hinduism.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it. The answer is D. Veda.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Veda}} \\]"
