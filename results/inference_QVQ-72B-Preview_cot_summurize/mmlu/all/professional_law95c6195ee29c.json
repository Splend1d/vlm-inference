As the highway passes through this business district, there is a stretch where the highway is too narrow to satisfS' the safety standards for state roadways. Along this narrow stretch and on opposite sides of the street are located two businesses. Situated on the east side of the street is a bar and grill; directly across the street on the west side is a lounge. In order to comply with state highway regulations, the state highway department, acting pursuant to state statute, ordered the city to prohibit parking on one side of the highway within the business district. The city council convened a special meeting to determine whether parking should be prohibited on the east or west side of the street. During the meeting, the council was unable to resolve the issue. Finally, the city council president decided the only fair way to resolve the matter was to flip a coin. After the coin flip, the city prohibited parking at all times on the west side of the highway. On account of this decision, parking in front of the lounge was permanently prohibited. This caused the lounge to suffer a substantial decline in business because of the unavailability of on-street parking. As a consequence, the owner of the lounge brought suit for declarative relief against the city alleging that the parking ban on his side of the street was unconstitutional.

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario here about a city's decision to ban parking on one side of a highway in their business district, and it's caused some issues for a lounge on that side. The lounge owner is suing, saying this ban is unconstitutional. I need to figure out if the plaintiff is likely to be successful in this cause of action. The options are:\n\nA. No, because as a governmental entity, the city enjoys immunity from such suits under the Eleventh Amendment.\n\nB. No, because the city's action was reasonable.\n\nC. Yes, because the action of the city violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nD. Yes, because responsible government officials cannot conduct or formulate their decision-making processes by means of coin flips.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. There's a highway running through the city's business district that doesn't meet state safety standards in a certain stretch because it's too narrow. The highway department told the city to prohibit parking on one side of the highway in this area to comply with regulations. The city council had to decide which side to ban parking on but couldn't agree, so they resorted to flipping a coin. The coin flip resulted in banning parking on the west side, which is where the lounge is located. This has hurt the lounge's business because there's no on-street parking available there now.\n\nSo, the lounge owner is claiming this is unconstitutional and seeking declaratory relief. I need to see which of these options is most likely correct.\n\nLet's look at option A: No, because the city enjoys immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. I remember that the Eleventh Amendment generally prevents a state from being sued in federal court without its consent. However, this case seems to be about a city's decision, not necessarily a state action. Plus, municipalities like cities can sometimes be sued, especially if it's under certain circumstances or if there's a waiver of immunity. I'm not entirely sure about this one, but maybe it's not the best answer.\n\nOption B: No, because the city's action was reasonable. Hmm, the city was faced with a regulation from the highway department to prohibit parking on one side of the highway for safety reasons. They had to choose one side, and they couldn't reach a consensus, so they flipped a coin. Is this reasonable? Well, from a practical standpoint, maybe choosing one side over the other seems arbitrary, but perhaps there were other factors they considered or didn't consider. The fact that they resorted to a coin flip might suggest a lack of consideration for the impact on both sides, but does that make the action unreasonable? I need to think about this more.\n\nOption C: Yes, because the city's action violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Equal Protection Clause requires that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. In this case, the city's decision affects one side of the street more than the other, particularly impacting the lounge. But was this discrimination intentional? Was it based on any class or group? The coin flip seems arbitrary, but was there a rational basis for the decision? Maybe the city had a rational basis for choosing one side over the other, even if it was just flipping a coin. I need to consider if this rises to a violation of equal protection.\n\nOption D: Yes, because government officials cannot make decisions by coin flips. This seems like a straightforward statement that using a coin flip for decision-making is improper. But is that true? In some contexts, random selection might be acceptable, like selecting audit targets or something. But in this case, it's about regulating parking and affecting businesses. Maybe there's an expectation that decisions should be based on some rational criteria rather than chance. But is there a specific law or constitutional provision that prohibits decision-making by coin flip?\n\nLet me think about this more systematically. The city was under a legal obligation to prohibit parking on one side of the highway to comply with state regulations. They had to choose one side, and they couldn't reach a consensus, so they flipped a coin. The result was that the west side, where the lounge is located, got the parking ban, which hurt the lounge's business.\n\nIs there a legal principle that says government decisions must be made in a certain way, like not through chance? I recall that administrative law generally requires that government decisions be rational, not arbitrary, and not capricious. Flipping a coin might be seen as arbitrary and capricious because it doesn't take into account relevant factors, like the impact on the businesses or traffic patterns.\n\nBut on the other hand, maybe the city didn't have any better information to make a choice, and flipping a coin was as good as any other method. However, that seems unlikely. They probably should have considered the potential impact on each side before making a decision.\n\nNow, considering the lounge owner is suing for declaratory relief, alleging that the parking ban is unconstitutional. For the Equal Protection Clause, the city's action would have to treat similarly situated entities differently without a rational basis. The lounge and the bar and grill are both businesses relying on customer parking, so they might be considered similarly situated. The city's decision to ban parking on one side but not the other could be seen as differential treatment.\n\nBut did the city have a rational basis for choosing one side over the other? If they flipped a coin, that doesn't seem like a rational basis. However, maybe they considered other factors that aren't mentioned here.\n\nAlso, the Eleventh Amendment issue: Does the city have immunity from such suits? Generally, states have sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment, but cities are typically considered arms of the state only in certain circumstances. Often, cities can be sued in federal court, especially under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, which allows suits against local governments for violations of constitutional rights.\n\nSo, option A seems unlikely to be correct because cities are generally not shielded by the Eleventh Amendment in the same way states are.\n\nOption B says no, because the city's action was reasonable. But given that they resorted to a coin flip, which seems arbitrary, I'm not sure that's a strong argument. Maybe the city should have considered the impact on both businesses and made a decision based on some criteria, not chance.\n\nOption C says yes, because it violates the Equal Protection Clause. That's possible, but I need to think about whether this differential treatment is substantial enough to violate equal protection. Maybe the court would find that the city had a rational basis for its decision, even if it was a coin flip.\n\nOption D says yes, because officials can't make decisions by coin flips. This seems like a direct criticism of the method used to make the decision. But is there a specific legal prohibition against using coin flips for decision-making?\n\nI need to consider if there's a constitutional or statutory requirement that government decisions be made in a particular way, specifically not through chance.\n\nLooking back at the scenario, the city was under a legal obligation to prohibit parking on one side of the highway. They had to choose one side, and they couldn't reach a consensus, so they flipped a coin. The lounge owner is arguing that this decision is unconstitutional.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to consider if the decision was arbitrary and capricious, which could be a violation of due process or equal protection.\n\nIn administrative law, decisions must be rational and not arbitrary. Flipping a coin might be seen as arbitrary because it doesn't take into account relevant factors.\n\nBut maybe the city didn't have any better information to make a choice, and flipping a coin was as good as any other method. However, that seems unlikely. They probably should have considered the potential impact on each side before making a decision.\n\nAlso, the fact that the lounge suffered a substantial decline in business might be relevant. If the city's decision had a significant negative impact on one business without a rational basis, that could be a problem.\n\nBut perhaps the city's action was reasonable in that they had to choose one side, and flipping a coin was a neutral way to do it.\n\nWait, but neutrality doesn't necessarily equate to rationality. If the city didn't consider the impact on the businesses, then the decision might be seen as arbitrary.\n\nI need to think about similar cases. Are there any precedents where a government's decision-making process was challenged because it involved chance or randomness?\n\nI recall that in some contexts, like jury selection, randomness is accepted and even desirable to ensure impartiality. But in regulatory decisions affecting specific businesses, it might be different.\n\nMaybe there's a difference between using randomness in jury selection and using it in regulatory decisions that have a direct impact on property rights or business operations.\n\nIn regulatory takings cases, for example, the government must provide just compensation if its actions amount to a taking of property. But in this case, it's a parking ban, which might affect business but isn't necessarily a taking.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this falls under substantive due process, where the court would review whether the city's action was arbitrary and capricious.\n\nGiven that, maybe the lounge owner has a case based on substantive due process, arguing that the city's decision was arbitrary and lacked a rational basis.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none of them mention substantive due process. Option C mentions equal protection, which is related but distinct.\n\nOption D is interesting because it directly criticizes the method of decision-making. But is there a legal principle that specifically prohibits decision-making by coin flip?\n\nI don't know of any specific law that says government officials can't make decisions by coin flip, but generally, decisions should be based on relevant factors and not on chance.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is D, because using a coin flip for such a significant decision is improper and could be seen as a failure to exercise proper discretion or to consider relevant factors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the city's action was reasonable because they had to choose one side, and flipping a coin was as fair as any other method, given that they couldn't reach a consensus.\n\nBut that seems like a weak argument because they should have considered the potential consequences of their decision on the affected businesses.\n\nPerhaps option C is better because the city's action treated similarly situated entities differently without a rational basis, which could violate equal protection.\n\nBut I'm still leaning towards option D because it directly addresses the method of decision-making.\n\nWait, maybe both C and D could be valid, but I have to choose the most likely successful cause of action.\n\nPerhaps the equal protection argument is stronger because it's a recognized constitutional principle, whereas the prohibition against decision-making by coin flip might not be as firmly established in law.\n\nOn the other hand, if the court finds that the coin flip was an arbitrary and capricious act, it might deem the decision unconstitutional on that basis alone.\n\nI need to think about which argument is more likely to prevail in court.\n\nConsidering that, I think option D is the most straightforward and likely correct answer.\n\nSo, the plaintiff is likely to be successful because responsible government officials cannot conduct or formulate their decision-making processes by means of coin flips.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D."
