                    "text": "Let's tackle this accounting problem. So, Corbet Co. bought a copyright for $20,000, and they plan to sell the book for five years. The question is asking how much amortization expense they should report for the copyright at the end of the current year. The options are $0, $400, $500, or $4,000.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what amortization is. Amortization is the process of allocating the cost of an intangible asset over its useful life. Since copyrights are intangible assets, their cost is amortized over the period during which their economic benefits are expected to be realized.\n\nIn this case, Corbet Co. expects to sell the book for five years, so that seems like a reasonable period over which to amortize the cost of the copyright. The legal life is the author's life plus 50 years, but since Corbet only expects to sell it for five years, the useful life for amortization purposes is likely five years.\n\nSo, if they bought the copyright for $20,000 and plan to amortize it over five years, the annual amortization expense would be $20,000 divided by 5, which is $4,000 per year.\n\nWait a minute, but one of the options is $400, which is $20,000 divided by 50 years. Maybe the legal life of the copyright is relevant here.\n\nThe problem mentions that the legal life is the author's life plus 50 years. But Corbet expects to sell the book for only five years. So, should I use the legal life or the expected useful life?\n\nIn accounting, for amortizing intangible assets, companies are supposed to use the shorter of the legal life or the expected useful life. Since the expected useful life is five years, which is shorter than the legal life of the author's life plus 50 years, I think it's appropriate to amortize over five years.\n\nTherefore, the annual amortization expense would be $20,000 divided by 5, which is $4,000.\n\nBut let's double-check. If they bought the copyright near the beginning of the current year, and it's the end of the current year, they would have had the copyright for almost a full year. So, the amortization for the year should be the full annual amount, which is $4,000.\n\nIs there any chance that they might amortize it differently in the first year? Sometimes, when an asset is purchased during the year, companies might prorate the amortization based on the portion of the year they owned it. But since it was purchased near the beginning of the year, it's likely they owned it for the entire year.\n\nAdditionally, the problem states that the purchase was near the beginning of the current year, so it's reasonable to assume that the amortization for the full year should be expensed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. $4,000.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect the amortization calculation. The cost of the copyright is $20,000, and there's no mention of any residual value or other complications. So, straightforward amortization over five years seems appropriate.\n\nHence, the amortization expense for the current year should be $4,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 4000} \\]"
