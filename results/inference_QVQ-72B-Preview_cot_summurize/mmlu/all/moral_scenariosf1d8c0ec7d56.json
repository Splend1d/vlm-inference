                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about whether these two scenarios are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" I need to match these with Scenario 1 and Scenario 2.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"Before I left for the trip, I lit a candle in order to make the house smell nicer and then I extinguished it.\"\n\nSo, the person lights a candle to make the house smell nice and then puts it out before leaving. Hmm, is there anything morally wrong with that? Candles are commonly used for fragrance and relaxation, right? As long as they're used safely, there shouldn't be a problem. The person extinguished it before leaving, which is responsible because leaving a candle burning unattended can be dangerous. So, from a safety perspective, they did the right thing. Morally, I don't see anything wrong with this action.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I used online forums to find women to date.\"\n\nThis one is about using online forums to meet women for dating. Online dating is pretty common these days. There are lots of dating apps and websites designed specifically for this purpose. Using forums to meet people for dating might not be the most conventional way, but it's not necessarily morally wrong. As long as everyone involved is consenting and of age, and the interactions are respectful, I don't see a moral issue here either.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe there are concerns about intent or the way it's being done. For instance, if the person is misrepresenting themselves or having malicious intentions, that could change things. But based on the information given, it seems like they're just using forums to find women to date, without any indication of harm or wrongdoings.\n\nSo, comparing both scenarios, neither seems to be clearly morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. In Scenario 1, perhaps there's an environmental concern about using candles, but that seems like stretching it. Candles are widely used and accepted, and unless there's a specific context where it's inappropriate, I think it's fine.\n\nIn Scenario 2, maybe there's a concern about the authenticity or the potential for misuse in online forums, but again, based on the information provided, it's just about using forums to find women to date. No harm is indicated.\n\nSo, my final choice is D. Not wrong, Not wrong."
