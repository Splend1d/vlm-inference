                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Nagel's view on moral assessment. The question says that before reflection, it's plausible that people cannot be morally assessed for certain things. And the options are:\n\nA. actions that affect only themselves.\n\nB. their character.\n\nC. what is due to factors beyond their control.\n\nD. actions that do not violate anyone\u2019s rights.\n\nI need to figure out which of these Nagel would think we can't be morally assessed for, prior to reflection.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what \"prior to reflection\" means in this context. I think it means that without thinking deeply or philosophically about moral responsibilities, our initial intuitions might tell us that certain actions or aspects of ourselves aren't open to moral judgment.\n\nNagel is Thomas Nagel, right? He's a philosopher who wrote about morality, free will, and other topics. I recall that he has ideas about how moral luck affects our moral judgments.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: actions that affect only themselves.\n\nSo, if someone does something that only affects them, like smoking or overeating, and no one else is directly harmed, might we initially think that they shouldn't be morally assessed for those actions? Maybe, because it's their own health or well-being they're impacting, not anyone else's. But then again, some people might argue that it's still morally wrong to harm oneself.\n\nOption B: their character.\n\nIs character something we can't be morally assessed for before reflection? Hmm. Our character traits, like honesty, courage, or selfishness, are often seen as central to moral evaluation. But maybe initially, without reflecting on it, we might think that character is just how we are, and not something we can be blamed or praised for.\n\nOption C: what is due to factors beyond their control.\n\nThis seems related to the concept of moral luck. Nagel has written about how sometimes, moral judgments can be influenced by factors outside a person's control. For example, if someone accidentally causes harm versus intentionally causing harm, our moral assessment might differ, even if the outcome is the same. So, perhaps before reflection, we might think that we shouldn't be morally assessed for things that are beyond our control.\n\nOption D: actions that do not violate anyone\u2019s rights.\n\nThis seems connected to the idea of negative rights, like the right to not be harmed or the right to liberty. If an action doesn't infringe on someone else's rights, maybe initially, we might think it's not morally assessable. But then again, there are actions that don't violate rights but might still be considered morally questionable, like charity work or personal choices that don't affect others.\n\nI need to think about which of these Nagel would consider plausible before reflection.\n\nConsidering Nagel's work on moral luck, I think he emphasizes how our moral assessments can be affected by factors beyond a person's control. So, option C seems particularly relevant.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIf we think about actions that affect only themselves (option A), Nagel might argue that even if an action only affects oneself, there could still be moral considerations, especially if it involves self-harm or neglect of one's duties to oneself.\n\nOption B, character, Nagel might argue that our character is central to moral assessment, as it influences our actions and intentions.\n\nOption D, actions that don't violate anyone's rights, Nagel might suggest that while these actions may not be morally wrong in the sense of violating rights, they could still be subject to moral evaluation based on other criteria, like moral virtues or the common good.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems the most fitting, as Nagel has written extensively on how factors beyond our control can affect moral assessment.\n\nMoreover, in his famous paper \"Moral Luck,\" Nagel discusses how we often hold people morally responsible for outcomes that are partly a matter of luck or beyond their control, which can complicate our moral assessments.\n\nTherefore, it's plausible that before reflection, people might think that they shouldn't be morally assessed for things that are due to factors beyond their control.\n\nSo, my answer would be option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
