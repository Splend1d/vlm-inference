Apparently, the co-defendants' investments had not been performing well in the economic downturn. The co-defendants, upset and humiliated by their firing, vowed to get back at the bank. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the bank and demand $2,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the bank should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, the co-defendants consulted the Internet, where they found all the information they needed on how to build a bomb. They built the bomb and placed it in a supply closet. Shortly thereafter, they phoned the bank and made a demand for the money. They said a bomb was in the bank and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The bank refused to pay the money. Realizing that their plan had gone awry, they drove to the bank to attempt to defuse the bomb. As they were driving back to the bank, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people.

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about two co-defendants who were investment brokers at a bank. They got fired and decided to get revenge by planting a bomb and demanding $2,000,000. They planned to tell the bank where the bomb was and how to defuse it after getting the money. They built the bomb using information from the internet and placed it in a supply closet. Then they called the bank, made the demand, and said the bomb would explode in 24 hours if the money wasn't paid. The bank didn't pay, so the co-defendants decided to go back and try to defuse the bomb themselves. On their way there, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. Now, they're charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder, and I need to figure out which statement is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what felony murder and conspiracy to commit murder mean. Felony murder is when someone dies during the commission of a felony, and the people involved can be charged with murder, even if they didn't intend to kill anyone. Conspiracy to commit murder is when two or more people agree to plan and carry out a murder.\n\nIn this case, the co-defendants planned to plant a bomb and demand money, with the intention of not actually hurting anyone because they planned to give the bank the information to defuse the bomb after getting the money. But unfortunately, the bomb exploded before they could defuse it, resulting in deaths.\n\nSo, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Both co-defendants are guilty of felony murder, but neither is guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nB. Both co-defendants are guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nC. Both co-defendants are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, but not murder.\n\nD. Both co-defendants are not guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nHmm. Let's think about conspiracy first. They definitely conspired to plant a bomb and demand money, with the understanding that if the money wasn't paid, the bomb would explode. Even though their plan was to defuse the bomb after getting the money, they still agreed to set up a situation where lives were at risk. So, it seems like they conspired to commit a crime that involved the risk of death or serious injury.\n\nNow, regarding murder, specifically felony murder. The bomb was planted as part of a felony (extortion), and deaths resulted from that act. Even though they didn't intend for anyone to die, because they planned to defuse the bomb, the bomb still exploded, leading to deaths. So, under felony murder rules, they could be charged with murder.\n\nBut wait, option A says they're guilty of felony murder but not conspiracy to commit murder. That doesn't seem right because they definitely conspired to carry out this plan.\n\nOption B says they're guilty of both murder and conspiracy to commit murder. This seems plausible because they conspired to commit a dangerous act, and deaths resulted from it.\n\nOption C says they're guilty of conspiracy to commit murder but not murder. That seems inconsistent because if they're guilty of conspiracy, and deaths resulted from their actions, they should also be guilty of murder under felony murder doctrine.\n\nOption D says they're not guilty of either, which doesn't seem to align with the facts presented.\n\nLet me think deeper. Conspiracy requires an agreement to commit a crime and an overt act in furtherance of that agreement. In this case, they agreed to plant a bomb and demand money, and they actually built and planted the bomb. So, they definitely committed conspiracy.\n\nAs for murder, under felony murder rules, if someone dies during the commission of a felony, the felons can be charged with murder. Here, the felony is extortion (demanding money under threat of explosion), and the bomb exploding during that process led to deaths. So, they should be guilty of murder.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any exception or specific aspect that might negate their guilt. For example, did they abandon their plan? They tried to go back and defuse the bomb, but the bomb exploded before they could. So, their attempt to prevent harm came after the harm had already occurred.\n\nAlso, their initial plan was to defuse the bomb after getting the money, but they didn't follow through with that part because the bank didn't pay. So, their plan to mitigate the risk depended on the bank paying, which didn't happen.\n\nI think the key point is that they set in motion a plan that involved a high risk to human life, and deaths resulted from that plan. Therefore, they should be guilty of both conspiracy to commit murder and murder under felony murder rules.\n\nSo, the correct statement is B: Both co-defendants are guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
