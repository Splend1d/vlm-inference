                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"In Python 3, which of the following is floor division? A. /, B. //, C. %, D. |.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these operators performs floor division in Python 3.\n\nFirst off, I know that division in Python can be a bit tricky sometimes, especially since there are different types of division. There's regular division, floor division, and then there's modulus, which is kind of related but different. So, let me make sure I understand what floor division is.\n\nFloor division is when you divide two numbers and then round down to the nearest whole number. In other words, it discards the fractional part and keeps only the integer part of the division. For example, if you have 9 divided by 2, which is 4.5, floor division would give you 4 because it rounds down.\n\nNow, in Python 3, I recall that the single forward slash (/) is used for regular division, which returns a floating-point number. So, if I use 9 / 2, I should get 4.5. But that's not floor division; that's just standard division.\n\nThe double forward slash (//) is another operator I've seen. I think this is the floor division operator. Let me test that. If I do 9 // 2, I believe it should give me 4, since it discards the fractional part. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nThe percentage sign (%) is the modulus operator. It returns the remainder of the division. So, 9 % 2 would give me 1, because 9 divided by 2 is 4 with a remainder of 1. That's not floor division; that's different.\n\nAnd then there's the pipe symbol (|), which I think is used for bitwise OR operations. It combines bits of two numbers. For example, 9 in binary is 1001, and 2 is 0010, so 9 | 2 would be 1011, which is 11 in decimal. That's definitely not floor division.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like the double forward slash (//) is the operator for floor division in Python 3. But just to be sure, let me double-check with some examples.\n\nLet's say I have two numbers, 10 and 3.\n\n- Regular division (10 / 3) should be approximately 3.3333333333333335.\n\n- Floor division (10 // 3) should be 3, since it discards the fractional part.\n\n- Modulus (10 % 3) should be 1, which is the remainder.\n\n- Bitwise OR (10 | 3) should be 11, which is the result of combining the bits.\n\nAnother example: negative numbers. Let's take -10 and 3.\n\n- Regular division (-10 / 3) should be approximately -3.3333333333333335.\n\n- Floor division (-10 // 3) should be -4, because it rounds down to the next smaller integer.\n\n- Modulus (-10 % 3) should be 2, since (-10) divided by 3 is -4 with a remainder of 2.\n\n- Bitwise OR (-10 | 3) would depend on how negative numbers are represented in binary, but that's a bit more complicated.\n\nWait, actually, in Python, negative numbers are handled differently in bitwise operations due to two's complement representation, but that's beside the point here. The main thing is that the // operator performs floor division, which is what we're interested in.\n\nLet me also check with decimal numbers to ensure I understand how floor division works.\n\nFor example, 9.5 // 2.\n\nRegular division: 9.5 / 2 = 4.75.\n\nFloor division: 9.5 // 2 should be 4, since it discards the fractional part.\n\nModulus: not applicable in the same way with floating-point numbers, but Python does allow it: 9.5 % 2 would give the floating-point remainder, which is 1.5.\n\nBitwise OR: doesn't make sense with floating-point numbers, as bitwise operations are for integers.\n\nSo, again, the double forward slash performs floor division even with floating-point numbers.\n\nWait a minute, does floor division convert floating-point numbers to integers? Let's see.\n\nIf I have 9.5 // 2, it's 4.0, which is a float, not an integer. Hmm, interesting. So, in Python 3, floor division of floating-point numbers results in a float that is the largest integer less than or equal to the division result.\n\nBut in the earlier example, 9 // 2 gave 4, which is an integer. So, it seems that when both operands are integers, the result is an integer, and when one or both are floats, the result is a float.\n\nLet me confirm that.\n\nExample:\n\n- 9 (int) // 2 (int) = 4 (int)\n\n- 9.0 (float) // 2 (int) = 4.0 (float)\n\n- 9 (int) // 2.0 (float) = 4.0 (float)\n\n- 9.0 (float) // 2.0 (float) = 4.0 (float)\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the // operator always returns the floor of the division, whether the result is an integer or a float.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, let's consider some edge cases.\n\nWhat happens if I divide by zero?\n\n- 9 / 0 will raise a ZeroDivisionError.\n\n- 9 // 0 will also raise a ZeroDivisionError.\n\n- 9 % 0 will raise a ZeroDivisionError.\n\n- 9 | 0 will give 9, since bitwise OR with zero doesn't change the value.\n\nSo, in all division operations, dividing by zero is undefined and raises an error.\n\nAnother edge case: dividing zero by any number.\n\n- 0 / x = 0.0 (if x != 0)\n\n- 0 // x = 0 (if x != 0)\n\n- 0 % x = 0 (if x != 0)\n\n- 0 | x = x, because zero OR anything is just x.\n\nAgain, if x is zero, it raises a ZeroDivisionError in the division operations.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered enough ground here. From all these examples and explanations, it's clear that the double forward slash (//) is the operator for floor division in Python 3.\n\nSo, the correct answer to the question is B. //.\n\nJust to reiterate, here's why:\n\n- A. / is regular division, which returns a float.\n\n- B. // is floor division, which discards the fractional part and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the division result.\n\n- C. % is the modulus operator, which returns the remainder of the division.\n\n- D. | is the bitwise OR operator, which combines bits of two integers.\n\nTherefore, the symbol for floor division in Python 3 is //.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\; //} \\]"
