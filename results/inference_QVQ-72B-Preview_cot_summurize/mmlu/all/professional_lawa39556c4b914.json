                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out what the court is most likely to do in this situation. Let me try to understand all the parts involved.\n\nFirst, there's a caterer who owns a summer cottage on a lake. This cottage is on a knoll above the lake, and to get to it, the caterer needs a way to access the property. So, the caterer makes an agreement with a neighbor who owns land adjacent to the caterer's property. This neighbor grants the caterer a right-of-way over a strip of land that's 30 feet wide and a quarter of a mile long, and this strip is along the eastern margin of the neighbor's property.\n\nOkay, so a right-of-way is like a path or a road that someone else has the right to use across your land. In this case, the caterer has the right to use this 30-foot strip to get to their cottage.\n\nNow, without telling the neighbor, the caterer decides to improve this road by having it asphalted. Asphalt is supposed to make it easier for motor vehicles to access the cottage. This happens several years before the neighbor starts a sand business.\n\nLater on, the neighbor starts a sand business and begins doing heavy hauling, which ends up destroying the asphalted surface on the road. So, because of the neighbor's activities, the road that the caterer improved is now damaged.\n\nNow, the caterer is taking legal action against the neighbor to stop them from using the road to transport sand. The question is, what will the court most likely do in this situation?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Issue an injunction against the neighbor to prevent further use of the road to haul sand.\n\nB. Refuse to grant the caterer's prayer for relief because the servient owner continues to have the right to use his own land.\n\nC. Issue an injunction against the neighbor unless it can be shown that the neighbor's use did not unreasonably interfere with the caterer's right of access.\n\nD. Dismiss the cause of action because the caterer's only remedy would be monetary damages.\n\nFirst, I need to understand some legal terms here. The \"servient owner\" is the owner of the land over which the right-of-way is granted, which in this case is the neighbor. The \"dominant tenement\" is the caterer's property, which has the benefit of the right-of-way.\n\nSo, the neighbor has granted the caterer a right-of-way over their land, but the neighbor still owns the land and has certain rights over it.\n\nNow, the caterer improved the road by asphalt without notifying the neighbor. Then, the neighbor's use of the road for heavy hauling damaged the asphalt.\n\nI need to figure out if the neighbor's actions are permissible under the terms of the right-of-way agreement.\n\nGenerally, a right-of-way allows another person to use a specified part of your land for a specific purpose. In this case, it's for access to the caterer's cottage. But the neighbor still has the right to use their own land, as long as it doesn't unreasonably interfere with the caterer's right of access.\n\nThe neighbor started a sand business and did heavy hauling that damaged the asphalted road. So, this action affected the caterer's improved road.\n\nNow, the caterer wants to enjoin, or stop, the neighbor from using the road to transport sand.\n\nOption A suggests that the court will issue an injunction to stop the neighbor from using the road for sand hauling.\n\nOption B says the court will refuse because the neighbor still has the right to use their own land.\n\nOption C says the court will issue an injunction unless it's shown that the neighbor's use doesn't unreasonably interfere with the caterer's right of access.\n\nOption D says the court will dismiss the case because the caterer's only remedy is monetary damages.\n\nI need to think about which one is most likely.\n\nFirst, the caterer has a right-of-way over the neighbor's land for access to the cottage. This implies that the caterer has the right to use that path for access purposes.\n\nThe caterer improved the road by asphalt without notifying the neighbor. While this might be seen as going beyond the terms of the agreement, the neighbor was aware of the improvement and didn't object at that time.\n\nSeveral years later, the neighbor starts a sand business and does heavy hauling that damages the asphalted surface.\n\nNow, the question is whether the neighbor's use of the road for heavy hauling interferes with the caterer's right of access.\n\nIf the heavy hauling damages the road to the point where it's no longer suitable for the caterer's access, then yes, it interferes with the caterer's right of access.\n\nBut the neighbor still has the right to use their land, including the right-of-way, for their own purposes, as long as it doesn't unreasonably interfere with the caterer's use.\n\nSo, the key here is whether the neighbor's use is unreasonable or interferes with the caterer's access.\n\nOption C seems to capture this by saying that an injunction would be issued unless it's shown that the neighbor's use doesn't unreasonably interfere with the caterer's right of access.\n\nOption B says the court will refuse because the servient owner has the right to use their land, but that's only if their use doesn't unreasonably interfere with the caterer's right of access.\n\nOption D suggests that the caterer's only remedy is monetary damages, but in cases where continued interference is occurring, an injunction might be appropriate to prevent future damage.\n\nOption A is a bit too absolute; it says the court will issue an injunction without considering whether the neighbor's use is reasonable or not.\n\nSo, between the options, I think Option C is the most balanced. It says the court will issue an injunction unless it can be shown that the neighbor's use doesn't unreasonably interfere with the caterer's right of access.\n\nThis makes sense because the neighbor has the right to use their land, but not in a way that destroys or significantly impairs the caterer's right of access.\n\nTherefore, the court would likely consider whether the neighbor's heavy hauling unreasonably interferes with the caterer's access, and if it does, an injunction might be issued to prevent further damage.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
