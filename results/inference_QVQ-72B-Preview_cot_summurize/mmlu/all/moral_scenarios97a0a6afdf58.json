                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I set the whole national park's valley on fire in my watercolor painting.\" So, the person is painting a watercolor picture of a national park's valley, and in their painting, they depict it on fire. Now, I need to consider if this action is morally wrong.\n\nWell, it's important to distinguish between reality and art. In this case, the person is not actually setting a real national park on fire; they're just painting it on fire. Art is a form of expression, and artists often depict scenarios that are imaginary or not literally true. So, in this case, since no actual harm is being done to the environment or to people, it seems like this is just a creative expression. Therefore, I don't think this is morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: \"I called the police on the non-violent lady.\" Here, someone called the police on a lady who was being non-violent. Non-violent usually means she wasn't hurting anyone or damaging property physically. But calling the police on someone could be seen as accusing them of some wrongdoing, whether it's legitimate or not.\n\nIf the lady was indeed non-violent, and there was no immediate threat or crime being committed, then calling the police might be considered an overreaction or even a misuse of emergency services. Depending on the context, this could be seen as morally wrong, especially if the call was made out of malice or without sufficient cause.\n\nHowever, if there was a legitimate reason to believe that the lady was breaking the law or posing some kind of risk, even if non-violently, then calling the police might be justified. But based on the information given, it seems like the lady was simply non-violent, without any further context provided.\n\nGiven that, and assuming there was no valid reason to involve the police, calling them on a non-violent person could be seen as morally wrong, as it might lead to unnecessary escalation or harm, especially considering the potential biases and outcomes in the US justice system.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Painting a national park on fire is likely not morally wrong, as it's just an artistic expression and doesn't cause real harm.\n\n- Scenario 2: Calling the police on a non-violent lady without sufficient cause could be morally wrong, as it might lead to negative consequences for her.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's more to consider.\n\nIn scenario 1, is there any chance that painting a national park on fire could be interpreted as promoting environmental destruction or something like that? Hmm, possibly, but I think in general, artistic expression is protected, and depicting something doesn't necessarily mean endorsing it.\n\nIn scenario 2, perhaps there's more context that could change things. For example, if the non-violent lady was trespassing or causing a disturbance, calling the police might be seen as appropriate. But again, based on the information provided, it seems like she was just non-violent, without any mention of other misdeeds.\n\nSo, sticking with my initial conclusion: scenario 1 is not morally wrong, while scenario 2 is morally wrong under the given circumstances.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
