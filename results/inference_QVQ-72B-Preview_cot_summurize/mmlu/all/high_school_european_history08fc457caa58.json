Lenin.\nThe independence of our country cannot be upheld unless we have an adequate industrial basis for defense. And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task\u2014in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it\u2014in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n\u2014Vladimir I.

                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this speech by Lenin from 1928. It's about industrialization and the challenges facing the Soviet Union at that time. He talks about the need for a strong industrial base to defend the country and mentions that socialism can't be built on two different foundations: advanced socialist industry and backward peasant agriculture. He emphasizes the importance of modernizing agriculture to match the industrial sector.\n\nNow, the question is asking which compromise from the New Economic Policy (NEP) Lenin is saying needs to be fixed in this speech. The NEP was introduced in 1921 as a temporary measure after the civil war, allowing some market elements to coexist with state control. It was a response to the economic hardships caused by World War I and the civil war.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Compromising with free markets in rural areas after the civil war.\n\nB. Sharing power with the provisional government.\n\nC. Giving the government too much power to further communism.\n\nD. Freeing the peasants from their landlords in exchange for their support.\n\nFirst, option B seems out of place because the provisional government was overthrown during the October Revolution in 1917, well before 1928. So, it doesn't make sense that Lenin would be talking about sharing power with them in 1928.\n\nOption D refers to freeing peasants from landlords in exchange for support. While land reform was a significant part of the Bolsheviks' early policies, this was implemented right after the revolution, not in 1928.\n\nOption C suggests that giving the government too much power to further communism is a compromise that needs fixing. But Lenin was a proponent of strong state control to build socialism. In fact, in this speech, he's emphasizing the need for more development and control to modernize agriculture. So, this option seems contradictory to his message.\n\nThat leaves option A: compromising with free markets in rural areas after the civil war. The NEP did allow for some market mechanisms in agriculture, where peasants could sell their surplus produce after meeting state quotas. This led to the emergence of a class of richer peasants, called kulaks, who operated small-scale capitalist farms.\n\nGiven that the speech is from 1928, which was a time when Stalin was pushing for rapid industrialization and collectivization of agriculture, it makes sense that Lenin would be concerned about the coexistence of socialist industry and capitalist agriculture. The speech mentions the need to bring agriculture up to the level of socialist industry and to place it on the basis of large-scale production.\n\nSo, it seems that Lenin is referring to the compromise made during the NEP, which allowed for free markets in rural areas, as something that needs to be fixed to align agriculture with the socialist industrial sector.\n\nLet me double-check. The NEP was introduced in 1921 and was still in place in 1928, although there were moves to restrict the kulaks and promote collectivization. Lenin died in 1924, so this speech must have been given by someone else, but the question attributes it to Lenin. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, Lenin died in 1924, but the speech is dated November 19, 1928. That can't be Lenin speaking in 1928. Maybe it's a mistake in the question, and it was actually given by Stalin or someone else.\n\nBut assuming it's a mistake and the speech was given by Lenin before his death, say around 1921-1924, the reference to 1928 might be an error. Alternatively, perhaps the date is correct, and it was someone else giving the speech.\n\nRegardless, the content of the speech emphasizes the need to modernize agriculture and align it with socialist industry, which aligns with the shift towards collectivization under Stalin in the late 1920s.\n\nBut to answer the question as it's presented, with the speech attributed to Lenin in 1928, and referring to the NEP, which was indeed a compromise with free markets in rural areas, option A seems the most fitting answer.\n\nSo, my answer is A. Compromising with free markets in rural areas after the civil war.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
