                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which crop began the Third Agricultural Revolution? A. Rice, B. Wheat, C. Barley, D. Millet.\" Hmm, I need to figure this out. I remember learning about agricultural revolutions in history class, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.\n\nFirst off, I should probably recall what the Third Agricultural Revolution is and when it took place. I think the First Agricultural Revolution was the Neolithic Revolution, where humans transitioned from hunting and gathering to farming and domesticating plants and animals. The Second Agricultural Revolution might have been during the Industrial Revolution, with mechanization and improvements in farming techniques.\n\nNow, the Third Agricultural Revolution sounds like it would be more recent. Maybe it's related to the Green Revolution in the mid-20th century, which involved developing high-yield varieties of crops, especially wheat and rice, to increase food production and address hunger issues.\n\nWait a minute, the Green Revolution is often associated with wheat and rice, so maybe one of these crops was the starting point for the Third Agricultural Revolution. Let me think about this.\n\nI recall that in the 1940s and 1950s, there was significant work done on wheat varieties in Mexico by someone named Norman Borlaug. He developed high-yielding wheat strains that helped Mexico become self-sufficient in wheat production. That seems like an important development.\n\nSimilarly, in the 1960s and 1970s, there was work on rice in Asia, particularly in the Philippines and India, which led to the development of high-yielding rice varieties known as IR8 and others. This helped to boost rice production and alleviate hunger in those regions.\n\nBut which one came first and started the Third Agricultural Revolution? Did wheat or rice come first in this context?\n\nLet me do a quick search in my mind. I think Norman Borlaug started his work in Mexico in the 1940s, and the Green Revolution is generally considered to have begun in the mid-1940s and spread through the 1970s.\n\nAs for rice, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) was established in the Philippines in 1960, and they developed IR8 in the mid-1960s. So, that would place the wheat advancements a bit earlier than the rice ones.\n\nDoes that mean wheat was the crop that began the Third Agricultural Revolution? That would make sense, given the timeline.\n\nBut wait, I should consider if there were any similar developments with barley or millet around that time. Barley and millet are also important crops, especially in certain regions, but I don't recall them being as central to the Green Revolution as wheat and rice were.\n\nPerhaps I should look into this more deeply. Let me consider the impact each crop had on the Green Revolution.\n\nWheat is a major crop in many parts of the world, especially in temperate regions. The development of high-yielding wheat varieties not only helped countries like Mexico but also had a significant impact in India and other parts of South Asia during the Green Revolution.\n\nRice, on the other hand, is the staple food for a large portion of the world's population, particularly in Asia. The development of high-yielding rice varieties was crucial in preventing widespread famine in countries like India, Pakistan, and the Philippines.\n\nHowever, considering the timeline, it seems that the wheat improvements started earlier and perhaps laid the foundation for similar advancements in rice and other crops.\n\nBarley and millet are also important, but they are generally considered secondary in terms of global production and consumption compared to wheat and rice. While there have been improvements in these crops as well, they weren't as pivotal in the Green Revolution.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, it seems that wheat was the crop that began the Third Agricultural Revolution.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should check if there's any specific reference to the Third Agricultural Revolution starting with wheat.\n\nAfter some thought, I recall that the Green Revolution is sometimes referred to as the Third Agricultural Revolution, following the Neolithic and the Second Agricultural Revolutions related to industrialization.\n\nIn that case, and given that wheat was one of the first crops to be targeted for improvement in the Green Revolution, it makes sense that wheat would be considered the starting point.\n\nMoreover, Norman Borlaug's work in wheat is widely recognized as a cornerstone of the Green Revolution, earning him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970.\n\nSo, all things considered, I'm confident that wheat is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B.
