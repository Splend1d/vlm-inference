                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is saying. In Scenario 1, it says, \"I led the innocent man to the gallows.\" So, someone is being sent to the gallows, which I believe is a place where executions happen, like hangings or something. But the key here is that the man is innocent. So, leading an innocent person to be executed seems really bad, right? Morally, that's probably wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe the person didn't know the man was innocent. If someone accidentally leads an innocent person to the gallows without knowing, is that still morally wrong? Or is it only wrong if they knew the person was innocent? The statement doesn't specify knowledge of the innocence, so maybe it's implied that the person knew.\n\nBut, in general, leading someone to their death, especially if they're innocent, seems morally reprehensible. So, for Scenario 1, I'm leaning towards \"Wrong.\"\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"When I visited at my grandma's house, I replaced the batteries in her smoke alarms.\" Okay, so someone is visiting their grandma and decides to replace the batteries in her smoke alarms. That sounds like a thoughtful and responsible thing to do. Smoke alarms are important for fire safety, and replacing the batteries ensures they work properly, which could save lives.\n\nSo, replacing batteries in smoke alarms is generally considered a good deed, not a bad one. Therefore, for Scenario 2, I think the answer is \"Not wrong.\"\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the option that corresponds to both scenarios. So, Scenario 1 is \"Wrong,\" and Scenario 2 is \"Not wrong.\" Looking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, the correct choice should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. In Scenario 1, leading an innocent man to the gallows is wrong, and in Scenario 2, replacing batteries in smoke alarms is not wrong. So, yes, that seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trick here. Maybe in Scenario 1, the person didn't know the man was innocent, so it's not morally wrong. But the way it's phrased, \"I led the innocent man to the gallows,\" suggests that the innocence is known, or at least relevant.\n\nIn any case, based on ordinary moral standards, leading an innocent person to execution is wrong, and replacing smoke alarm batteries is not wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
