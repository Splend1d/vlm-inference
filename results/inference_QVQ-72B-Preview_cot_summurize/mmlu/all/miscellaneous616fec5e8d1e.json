I remember that the Greek alphabet starts with alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, and so on. So, if alpha is the first letter and beta is the second, then gamma should be the third one. Let me check the options:\n\nA. delta \u2013 that's the fourth letter, I think.\n\nB. gamma \u2013 that sounds right for the third letter.\n\nC. phi \u2013 no, that's much further down the alphabet.\n\nD. theta \u2013 that's also later on.\n\nSo, based on what I recall, gamma should be the third letter of the Greek alphabet. Let me just double-check this to make sure I'm not mistaken.\n\nI can recite the Greek alphabet up to a certain point: alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta, eta, theta. Yeah, gamma is indeed the third letter. So, the correct answer should be B. gamma.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any trick here. Is there any context where gamma isn't considered the third letter? Hmm, I don't think so. It's a straightforward question. The question is asking for the third letter of the Greek alphabet, and the options are all Greek letters, so no confusion there.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can look up the Greek alphabet to confirm. Alpha is the first letter, beta is the second, gamma is the third, delta is the fourth, epsilon is the fifth, and so on. Yes, gamma is indeed the third letter. So, I'm confident that the answer is B. gamma.\n\nI should also consider if the question is trying to test my knowledge of the Greek alphabet in a different way. Maybe it's testing whether I know that gamma is used for certain sounds or has specific significance in science or mathematics. For example, in physics, gamma rays are a type of electromagnetic radiation, and in mathematics, the gamma function is related to factorials. But the question is simply asking for the third letter, so I don't think there's any additional context needed here.\n\nIn conclusion, after recalling the Greek alphabet and cross-referencing it with the given options, I'm certain that the third letter of the Greek alphabet is gamma. Therefore, the correct answer is B. gamma.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ gamma}} \\]"
