                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we're given that \\(f(2x) = x + 5\\) and that \\(f(g(6)) = 13\\). We need to find \\(2 \\times g(6)\\), and there are multiple choices provided: 6, 16, 32, or 36.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \\(f(2x) = x + 5\\) really means. This seems like a function definition, where \\(f\\) is applied to \\(2x\\), and the result is \\(x + 5\\). So, for any value of \\(x\\), if I plug \\(2x\\) into \\(f\\), I get \\(x + 5\\).\n\nNext, we're given \\(f(g(6)) = 13\\). This means that when we plug \\(g(6)\\) into \\(f\\), we get 13. So, according to the first equation, if \\(f(2x) = x + 5\\), then for \\(f(g(6)) = 13\\), we can set up an equation where \\(2x\\) is equal to \\(g(6)\\), and \\(x + 5 = 13\\).\n\nWait a minute, but that doesn't seem directly applicable because \\(f(2x) = x + 5\\), and \\(f(g(6)) = 13\\). So, perhaps I need to find a way to relate \\(g(6)\\) to \\(2x\\).\n\nLet me try to express \\(f\\) in terms of its input. If \\(f(2x) = x + 5\\), then for some value \\(a\\), if I have \\(f(a) = something\\), I need to relate \\(a\\) to \\(2x\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can solve for \\(f\\) in terms of its argument. Let's see.\n\nGiven \\(f(2x) = x + 5\\), I can think of \\(2x\\) as the input to \\(f\\), and \\(x + 5\\) as the output. So, if I let \\(y = 2x\\), then \\(x = \\frac{y}{2}\\), and substituting back, \\(f(y) = \\frac{y}{2} + 5\\).\n\nOh, that's interesting! So, \\(f(y) = \\frac{y}{2} + 5\\). That makes sense because if \\(y = 2x\\), then \\(x = \\frac{y}{2}\\), and plugging into \\(x + 5\\) gives \\(\\frac{y}{2} + 5\\).\n\nNow, with \\(f(y) = \\frac{y}{2} + 5\\), and given that \\(f(g(6)) = 13\\), I can substitute \\(g(6)\\) for \\(y\\):\n\n\\(f(g(6)) = \\frac{g(6)}{2} + 5 = 13\\).\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{g(6)}{2} + 5 = 13\\).\n\nNow, I can solve for \\(g(6)\\):\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n\n\\(\\frac{g(6)}{2} = 13 - 5 = 8\\).\n\nThen, multiply both sides by 2:\n\n\\(g(6) = 16\\).\n\nBut wait, the question asks for \\(2 \\times g(6)\\), so \\(2 \\times 16 = 32\\).\n\nLooking back at the options, 32 is one of the choices.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, going back to the original equation \\(f(2x) = x + 5\\), and knowing that \\(f(g(6)) = 13\\), perhaps I can set \\(2x = g(6)\\), and \\(x + 5 = 13\\).\n\nSo, \\(x + 5 = 13\\) implies \\(x = 13 - 5 = 8\\).\n\nThen, since \\(2x = g(6)\\), \\(g(6) = 2 \\times 8 = 16\\).\n\nAgain, \\(2 \\times g(6) = 2 \\times 16 = 32\\).\n\nAlternatively, if I consider \\(f(g(6)) = 13\\), and from \\(f(y) = \\frac{y}{2} + 5\\), setting \\(y = g(6)\\), I get \\(\\frac{g(6)}{2} + 5 = 13\\), which leads to the same result.\n\nI think this is consistent. So, the answer should be 32.\n\nWait, but let's see if there's any possibility of misinterpretation.\n\nSuppose \\(f(2x) = x + 5\\), and \\(f(g(6)) = 13\\). Maybe there's a different relationship or something I'm missing.\n\nLet me consider if \\(f\\) is a linear function. From \\(f(y) = \\frac{y}{2} + 5\\), it seems linear, and the steps I took should be valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a composition of functions here that I need to consider more carefully.\n\nLet me think about \\(f(g(6))\\). If I know \\(f(y) = \\frac{y}{2} + 5\\), then \\(f(g(6)) = \\frac{g(6)}{2} + 5 = 13\\), which is what I used.\n\nSolving for \\(g(6)\\):\n\n\\(\\frac{g(6)}{2} + 5 = 13\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{g(6)}{2} = 8\\)\n\n\\(g(6) = 16\\)\n\nThen, \\(2 \\times g(6) = 32\\)\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other approach or if there's a trap in the question.\n\nThe question gives \\(f(2x) = x + 5\\), and asks for \\(2 \\times g(6)\\), given \\(f(g(6)) = 13\\).\n\nI don't see any immediate alternative interpretation that would change the result.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 32.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 6\n\nB. 16\n\nC. 32\n\nD. 36\n\nSo, the correct choice is C. 32.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]"
