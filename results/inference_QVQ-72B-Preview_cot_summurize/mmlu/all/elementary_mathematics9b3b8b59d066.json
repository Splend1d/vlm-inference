                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Peter works 38 hours a week and earns $7.25 per hour. His employer gives him a raise, and now his weekly gross pay is $307.80. We need to find out what the increase in his weekly gross pay is. The options are A. $32.30, B. $34.70, C. $42.46, and D. $275.50.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what Peter's original weekly gross pay was before the raise. Since he works 38 hours a week at $7.25 per hour, I can calculate that by multiplying the number of hours by his hourly rate.\n\nSo, original weekly pay = 38 hours * $7.25/hour.\n\nLet me calculate that: 38 times 7 is 266, and 38 times 0.25 is 9.50. So, 266 + 9.50 = $275.50.\n\nOkay, so before the raise, Peter was making $275.50 a week.\n\nNow, after the raise, his weekly gross pay is $307.80.\n\nTo find the increase, I need to subtract his original pay from his new pay.\n\nSo, increase = new pay - original pay = $307.80 - $275.50.\n\nLet me do that subtraction: 307.80 minus 275.50. Well, 307 minus 275 is 32, and 0.80 minus 0.50 is 0.30. So, $32.30.\n\nLooking back at the options, A. $32.30 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming the original pay: 38 hours * $7.25 per hour.\n\n38 * 7 = 266\n\n38 * 0.25 = 9.50\n\n266 + 9.50 = 275.50\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, new pay is given as $307.80.\n\nSubtracting 275.50 from 307.80:\n\n307.80\n\n-275.50\n\n= 32.30\n\nYes, that matches option A.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nMaybe using hourly wages directly without calculating the original pay.\n\nWait, no. The problem gives us the original hourly wage and the number of hours, so calculating the original pay is straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the raise was a percentage increase, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just says his employer gives him a raise that increases his weekly gross pay to $307.80.\n\nSo, it's likely a direct increase in his weekly pay, not a percentage raise on his hourly wage.\n\nTherefore, the increase is simply the difference between his new pay and his original pay, which is $307.80 - $275.50 = $32.30.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be A. $32.30.\n\nWait a minute, but option D is $275.50, which is Peter's original pay, not the increase. So, that can be eliminated.\n\nOption B is $34.70, which might be a miscalculation, and option C is $42.46, which doesn't seem to relate directly to the problem.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option A. $32.30 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ \\$32.30} \\]"
