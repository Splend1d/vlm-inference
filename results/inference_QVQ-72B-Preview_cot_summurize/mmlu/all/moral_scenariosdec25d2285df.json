                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. I'm not from the US, but I think I have a general idea of what's considered moral there. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I told people that vaccines cause autism so I could sell them snake oil.\"\n\nOkay, so here, someone is spreading information that vaccines cause autism to sell some kind of fake remedy or treatment. I know that there's a lot of talk about vaccines and autism, but according to scientific research, there's no evidence that vaccines cause autism. That's a big deal because misinformation like this can lead people to avoid vaccines, which protects not only themselves but also others through herd immunity.\n\nSo, by spreading false information and using it to sell something that's not backed by science, it seems pretty unethical. It's taking advantage of people's fears and lack of knowledge for personal gain. That sounds wrong to me.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I fixed broken games slowly, so the customers would lose extra quarters.\"\n\nThis one is a bit different. It seems like someone is repairing arcade games or something similar but doing it deliberately slowly so that customers end up losing more quarters while playing. So, essentially, by prolonging the time it takes to fix the game, customers might be more likely to lose money trying to play a broken game.\n\nThis feels tricky. On one hand, if the game is broken, it's not fair to the customers to have to keep putting in quarters without getting proper playtime. On the other hand, if the person fixing the game is\u6545\u610f slowing down the repair process to benefit from the customers losing more money, that seems dishonest.\n\nBut, is this clearly morally wrong? Well, it depends on the context. If the person fixing the game is an employee and their job is to fix the games, then\u6545\u610f slowing down could be seen as unethical because it's not in the best interest of the customers or even the employer, who might be relying on having functional games.\n\nHowever, if the person fixing the game is the owner of the arcade, then maybe they're making more money by having the game broken longer. But even then, it's still unethical because it's deceptive to the customers. They're not being told that the game is intentionally being kept broken to make them lose more money.\n\nSo, in both scenarios, there's an element of deception for personal gain. In Scenario 1, it's spreading false information to sell a product, and in Scenario 2, it's manipulating the repair process to make more money from customers.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US, both actions seem to be clearly morally wrong. Deception and taking advantage of others for personal gain are generally considered unethical.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a difference in the degree of harm caused by each action.\n\nIn Scenario 1, spreading misinformation about vaccines could lead to real harm, as people might avoid vaccinating, which could lead to outbreaks of diseases and potentially deaths. That's a pretty severe consequence.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the harm is more minor\u2014customers might lose a few extra quarters. While that's still wrong, it's on a smaller scale and doesn't have the same level of potential harm as in Scenario 1.\n\nBut the question is asking whether each scenario is \"clearly morally wrong\" according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Both scenarios involve deception and personal gain at the expense of others, which are generally considered wrong.\n\nSo, my answer would be that both scenarios are clearly morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven that, option A seems to be the correct choice, as both scenarios are considered wrong.\n\nHowever, I'm wondering if there's a possibility that one of them could be considered not wrong. Maybe in certain contexts, but based on the information provided, both seem clearly wrong.\n\nLet me consider if there's any way Scenario 2 could be considered not wrong. Suppose the games were breaking down frequently anyway, and fixing them slowly didn't cause any additional harm beyond what was already happening. But even then, if the person is intentionally slowing down the repairs to benefit from customers losing more quarters, it still seems unethical.\n\nSimilarly, in Scenario 1, spreading misinformation for personal gain is almost always considered wrong, especially when it concerns health and well-being.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
