                    "text": "So I have this question about density. It says that if the volume of an object were to double, and there's no change in mass, what would happen to the density? The options are: A. halve, B. double, C. be the same, or D. none of these.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember what density is. Density is defined as mass per unit volume, right? So, density equals mass divided by volume. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the problem says that the volume doubles, but the mass remains the same. So, if volume increases and mass stays constant, what happens to density?\n\nLet me think about this step by step. If volume doubles, and mass stays the same, then density should decrease, because density is mass divided by volume. So, if volume increases while mass stays constant, density decreases.\n\nBut, let's see by how much it decreases. If mass is constant and volume doubles, then density should halve, because density is inversely proportional to volume when mass is constant.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think mathematically. Density is \u03c1 = m / v. If mass m stays the same, and volume v doubles to 2v, then new density \u03c1' = m / (2v) = (1/2) * (m / v) = (1/2) \u03c1.\n\nSo, new density is half the original density. That means density halves when volume doubles, assuming mass remains constant.\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward, but let me consider if there's any other factor that could affect this.\n\nThe problem states that there's no change in mass, and volume doubles. So, no, nothing else is changing. Therefore, density should indeed halve.\n\nWait a minute, is there any scenario where this wouldn't hold true? Well, in reality, mass is conserved, so if volume increases without adding more mass, density should decrease.\n\nAlso, thinking about it in terms of units might help. Density is in kilograms per cubic meter, or grams per cubic centimeter, etc. If you have, say, 1 kg of a substance, and it occupies 1 cubic meter, density is 1 kg/m\u00b3. If the volume doubles to 2 cubic meters, and mass remains 1 kg, then density becomes 0.5 kg/m\u00b3. So, yes, it halves.\n\nLet me consider another example. Suppose I have a block of metal that's 2 kg and has a volume of 1 liter (1000 cm\u00b3). Its density is 2 kg per liter. If I somehow make the volume double to 2 liters without changing the mass, then density becomes 1 kg per liter. Again, it's halved.\n\nIs there any way density could stay the same or double in this scenario? Only if mass changes, but the problem specifies that mass doesn't change.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the correct answer should be A. halve.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possible confusion here.\n\nOption B is \"double,\" which would be incorrect because increasing volume while keeping mass constant would decrease density, not increase it.\n\nOption C is \"be the same,\" which is also incorrect because density does change when volume changes at constant mass.\n\nOption D is \"none of these,\" which doesn't apply here since the correct answer is among the given options.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. halve.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ halve.}} \\]"
