                    "text": "So I have this problem: 11.7 + 3.4 + 6.3. I need to find the sum using mental math. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I can look at the numbers and see if there's a way to group them to make the addition easier. Maybe I can add 11.7 and 3.4 first, and then add 6.3 to the result. Let's try that.\n\nSo, 11.7 plus 3.4. I can break it down: 11 plus 3 is 14, and then 0.7 plus 0.4 is 1.1. So, 11.7 + 3.4 equals 14.1. Now, I need to add 6.3 to that. 14.1 plus 6.3. 14 plus 6 is 20, and then 0.1 plus 0.3 is 0.4. So, 14.1 + 6.3 equals 20.4.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to group these numbers that might be even easier? Maybe I can add 11.7 and 6.3 first, and then add 3.4. Let's see.\n\n11.7 plus 6.3. 11 plus 6 is 17, and 0.7 plus 0.3 is 1.0, so that's 17.0. Then, adding 3.4 to 17.0: 17 plus 3 is 20, and 0.0 plus 0.4 is 0.4, so that gives me 20.4 again. Okay, same result.\n\nMaybe I can try adding them all together at once. 11.7 + 3.4 + 6.3. Let's see: 11.7 plus 6.3 is 18.0, and then adding 3.4: 18 plus 3 is 21, and 0.0 plus 0.4 is 0.4, so 21.4. Wait, that's different from what I got before. Hmm, that can't be right.\n\nOh, I see where I went wrong. When I added 11.7 + 6.3, I got 18.0, but actually, 11.7 + 6.3 is 18.0, which is correct. Then adding 3.4: 18.0 + 3.4. 18 plus 3 is 21, and 0.0 plus 0.4 is 0.4, so it should be 21.4. But earlier, when I added them in different orders, I got 20.4 both times. There must be a mistake here.\n\nLet me check the first way I did it: 11.7 + 3.4. 11 + 3 is 14, and 0.7 + 0.4 is 1.1, so 14.1. Then, 14.1 + 6.3: 14 + 6 is 20, and 0.1 + 0.3 is 0.4, so 20.4. Okay, that seems consistent.\n\nThen, adding 11.7 and 6.3: 11 + 6 is 17, and 0.7 + 0.3 is 1.0, so 17.0. Then, 17.0 + 3.4: 17 + 3 is 20, and 0.0 + 0.4 is 0.4, so 20.4 again. Both methods give me 20.4.\n\nBut when I tried adding them all at once, I somehow ended up with 21.4, which doesn't match. Wait, no, actually, 11.7 + 6.3 is indeed 18.0, and then adding 3.4: 18.0 + 3.4 should be 21.4. But that contradicts my previous results of 20.4.\n\nI think I must have made a mistake in adding 11.7 + 6.3. Let me double-check that. 11.7 plus 6.3: 11 + 6 is 17, and 0.7 + 0.3 is 1.0, so 17.0. Then, adding 3.4: 17.0 + 3.4. 17 + 3 is 20, and 0.0 + 0.4 is 0.4, so it should be 20.4, not 21.4. I must have miscalculated that step.\n\nPerhaps I added 18.0 + 3.4 instead of 17.0 + 3.4, which would give me 21.4. Yes, that must be the error. So, correcting that, 17.0 + 3.4 is indeed 20.4.\n\nNow, to confirm, regardless of the order in which I add these numbers, the sum should be the same. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can add 3.4 and 6.3 first, and then add 11.7.\n\n3.4 + 6.3: 3 + 6 is 9, and 0.4 + 0.3 is 0.7, so 9.7. Then, add 11.7 to 9.7: 11 + 9 is 20, and 0.7 + 0.0 is 0.7, so 20.7. Wait, now I'm getting a different answer again. This can't be right.\n\nHmm, what did I do wrong this time? Let me check the addition of 3.4 + 6.3. 3 + 6 is 9, and 0.4 + 0.3 is 0.7, so 9.7 is correct. Then, adding 11.7 to 9.7: 11 + 9 is 20, and 0.7 + 0.7 is 1.4, so it should be 20.4, not 20.7. I must have misadded the decimal parts.\n\nYes, 0.7 + 0.7 is 1.4, so carrying over the one, it's 20 + 1 is 21, and then 0.4, making it 21.4. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 20.4. Now I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try again, more carefully. 3.4 + 6.3: 3 + 6 is 9, and 0.4 + 0.3 is 0.7, so 9.7. Then, adding 11.7 to 9.7: 11 + 9 is 20, and 0.7 + 0.7 is 1.4, so total is 20 + 1.4 = 21.4.\n\nBut earlier, when I added 11.7 + 3.4, I got 14.1, and then added 6.3 to get 20.4. Similarly, adding 11.7 + 6.3 gives 18.0, plus 3.4 gives 21.4. Wait, now I'm getting both 20.4 and 21.4 as possible sums, which can't be right.\n\nI must have made another mistake. Let me check the first addition: 11.7 + 3.4. 11 + 3 is 14, and 0.7 + 0.4 is 1.1, so 14.1. Yes, that's correct. Then, 14.1 + 6.3: 14 + 6 is 20, and 0.1 + 0.3 is 0.4, so 20.4. That seems right.\n\nNow, for 11.7 + 6.3: 11 + 6 is 17, and 0.7 + 0.3 is 1.0, so 17.0. Then, 17.0 + 3.4: 17 + 3 is 20, and 0.0 + 0.4 is 0.4, so 20.4. Again, 20.4.\n\nBut when I added 3.4 + 6.3 + 11.7, I got 21.4. Wait, no, when I added 3.4 + 6.3, I got 9.7, and then added 11.7 to get 21.4. But according to the associative property of addition, the order shouldn't matter; the sum should be the same.\n\nHowever, I'm getting inconsistent results. Maybe I need to consider the actual values more carefully. Let me write down the numbers:\n\n11.7\n\n+3.4\n\n+6.3\n\nTotal?\n\nFirst, add 11.7 and 3.4:\n\n11.7\n\n+3.4\n\n= 15.1\n\nWait, hold on. Earlier I thought 11 + 3 is 14 and 0.7 + 0.4 is 1.1, so 14.1. But now I'm getting 15.1. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me align the decimals properly. 11.7\n\n+3.4\n\nAdding the decimal parts: 0.7 + 0.4 = 1.1\n\nThen, 11 + 3 = 14\n\nSo, 14 + 1.1 is 15.1, not 14.1. I must have misremembered earlier. So, 11.7 + 3.4 = 15.1\n\nThen, 15.1 + 6.3: 15 + 6 is 21, and 0.1 + 0.3 is 0.4, so 21.4\n\nOkay, now that matches with adding 11.7 + 6.3 = 18.0, then 18.0 + 3.4 = 21.4\n\nAnd adding 3.4 + 6.3 = 9.7, then 9.7 + 11.7 = 21.4\n\nSo, the correct sum is 21.4\n\nWait a minute, but earlier I thought it was 20.4. Where did that come from?\n\nLet me check again. Starting with 11.7 + 3.4:\n\n11.7\n\n+3.4\n\n= 15.1\n\nThen, 15.1 + 6.3:\n\n15.1\n\n+6.3\n\n= 21.4\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nPerhaps in my initial attempt, I made a mistake in adding 15.1 + 6.3 and got 20.4 instead of 21.4. It's possible I thought 15 + 6 is 21, and then 0.1 + 0.3 is 0.4, so 21.4, but somehow I wrote down 20.4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misadded 11.7 + 3.4 as 14.1 instead of 15.1, and then 14.1 + 6.3 = 20.4. That must be what happened.\n\nNow that I've corrected that error, the correct sum is indeed 21.4.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 20.3\n\nB. 20.4\n\nC. 21.4\n\nD. 22.4\n\nThe correct answer should be C. 21.4\n\nTo ensure there are no further mistakes, let me perform one more check by adding all the numbers directly:\n\n11.7 + 3.4 + 6.3\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n11.7 + 3.4:\n\n11.7\n\n+3.4\n\n= 15.1\n\nThen, 15.1 + 6.3:\n\n15.1\n\n+6.3\n\n= 21.4\n\nYes, that confirms the sum is 21.4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 21.4\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ 21.4} \\]"
