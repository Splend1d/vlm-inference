The options are A. Franks, B. Visigoths, C. Russians, D. Anglo-Saxons.\"\n\nAlright, I need to figure out which one of these groups converted to Christianity in the tenth century, and specifically, it was due to missionaries from the Byzantine Empire.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall some basic timelines for each of these groups.\n\nStarting with the Franks: I know that the Franks were a Germanic tribe that settled in what is now France and Germany. Clovis, the Frankish king, converted to Christianity in the late fourth or early fifth century, I think. So that would be way before the tenth century. So, option A, Franks, is probably not the right answer.\n\nNext, the Visigoths: They were another Germanic tribe that played a significant role in the fall of the Western Roman Empire. I believe they established a kingdom in Spain and Portugal. As for their conversion to Christianity, I recall that they initially practiced Arian Christianity, which was considered heretical by the Roman Catholic Church. I think they eventually converted to Roman Catholicism in the seventh century, under King Recceswinth around 589 AD. Again, that's before the tenth century. So, option B, Visigoths, is likely incorrect.\n\nNow, the Russians: This is an interesting one. I've heard of Vladimir the Great, who was the Grand Prince of Kiev, and I think he converted to Christianity in the late tenth century. Specifically, I believe it was around 988 AD when he adopted Eastern Orthodox Christianity, which was brought by missionaries from the Byzantine Empire. This seems to fit perfectly with the question's description. So, option C, Russians, is a strong candidate.\n\nLastly, the Anglo-Saxons: They were Germanic tribes that migrated to England and formed the kingdoms that eventually became England. I know that Christianity arrived in Anglo-Saxon England in the sixth century, primarily through the efforts of Saint Augustine of Canterbury, who was sent by Pope Gregory the Great. So, again, this conversion happened earlier than the tenth century. Therefore, option D, Anglo-Saxons, is probably not the correct choice.\n\nSo, based on the timelines I've recalled, the Russians converted to Christianity in the tenth century, specifically around 988 AD, under Prince Vladimir of Kiev, through the influence of Byzantine missionaries.\n\nJust to make sure I'm not missing anything, maybe I should double-check if there were any other conversions among these groups in the tenth century.\n\nFor the Franks, after Clovis's conversion in the fifth century, their kingdom became firmly Christian, so no need for another conversion in the tenth century.\n\nThe Visigoths converted in the seventh century, as I mentioned earlier, so again, no tenth-century conversion there.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxons were Christianized in the sixth and seventh centuries, with the establishment of dioceses and the like, so no tenth-century conversion.\n\nThe Russians, as I recalled, converted in the tenth century under Vladimir the Great, adopting Eastern Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Russians.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
