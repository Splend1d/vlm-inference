                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here. It says that a medicine causes side effects in one out of every five patients who take it. A doctor prescribes this medicine to four unrelated patients, and I need to find the probability that none of them will develop side effects. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have four patients, each independently taking this medicine. For each patient, there's a chance they might develop side effects, but we're interested in the situation where none of them do. So, I need to find the probability that all four patients avoid side effects.\n\nAlright, let's think about probabilities. If the medicine causes side effects in one out of every five patients, that means the probability of developing side effects is 1/5, which is 0.2. So, the probability of not developing side effects would be 1 minus the probability of developing them, right? That would be 1 - 0.2, which is 0.8.\n\nNow, since there are four unrelated patients, and their responses to the medicine are independent of each other, I can assume that each one has the same probability of 0.8 for not developing side effects.\n\nTo find the probability that all four patients do not develop side effects, I need to find the probability that the first patient doesn't have side effects, and the second patient doesn't have side effects, and so on, for all four patients.\n\nSince these are independent events, I can multiply the probabilities together to get the combined probability. So, it would be 0.8 multiplied by itself four times.\n\nLet me calculate that: 0.8^4.\n\nLet's see, 0.8 squared is 0.64, and 0.64 squared is... let's compute that.\n\n0.64 times 0.6 is 0.384, and 0.64 times 0.4 is 0.256. Adding those together, 0.384 + 0.256 equals 0.64.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because 0.64 squared should be less than 0.64. Hmm, maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as (8/10)^4. Let's compute that.\n\n8/10 is 0.8, which is the same as before. So, 8/10 squared is 64/100, which is 0.64. Then, 0.64 squared is 0.4096.\n\nWait a minute, that seems familiar. Is that the answer?\n\nLooking back, the options are:\n\nA. 0.8\n\nB. 0.4096\n\nC. 0.25\n\nD. 0.2\n\nSo, according to my calculation, it should be 0.4096, which is option B.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWe have the probability of not having side effects for one patient as 0.8. For four independent patients, the probability that all four do not have side effects is indeed 0.8^4.\n\nCalculating 0.8^4:\n\n0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64\n\n0.64 * 0.8 = 0.512\n\n0.512 * 0.8 = 0.4096\n\nYes, that checks out. So, the probability is 0.4096, which is option B.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nMaybe using the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is P(k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where n is the number of trials, k is the number of successes, p is the probability of success.\n\nIn this case, we're looking for the probability of 0 patients developing side effects, so k=0, n=4, and p=0.2 (probability of side effects).\n\nPlugging into the formula: P(0) = C(4,0) * (0.2)^0 * (0.8)^4.\n\nC(4,0) is 1, since there's only one way to have 0 successes out of 4.\n\n0.2^0 is 1, since any number to the power of 0 is 1.\n\nSo, P(0) = 1 * 1 * (0.8)^4 = 0.4096\n\nAgain, that confirms the answer is 0.4096.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to think in terms of complementary probabilities, I could find the probability that at least one patient develops side effects and subtract that from 1. But that seems more complicated for this specific problem, since we're only interested in the case where none have side effects.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 0.4096, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.4096} \\]"
