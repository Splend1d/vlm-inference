                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question about how attitudes toward premarital and extramarital sex have changed over the past several decades. The options are:\n\nA. remained constant; remained constant\n\nB. become less permissive; become more accepting\n\nC. remained constant; become less accepting\n\nD. become more permissive; become less accepting\n\nOkay, so I need to think about premarital and extramarital sex separately and see how people's views on them have evolved.\n\nFirst, premarital sex. That means having sex before getting married. And extramarital sex is having sex while you're already married, but not with your spouse.\n\nI remember reading somewhere that society has become more accepting of premarital sex over time. Like, in the past, it was more taboo to have sex before marriage, but nowadays, it's seen as more acceptable. So, maybe attitudes have become more permissive.\n\nOn the other hand, extramarital sex seems pretty frowned upon, right? I think cheating on your spouse is generally considered wrong, and I don't think that view has changed much.\n\nWait, but maybe there are some trends where people are more tolerant of extramarital affairs these days. I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to recall some data or studies on this.\n\nI think in many cultures, especially Western ones, premarital sex has become more accepted over the years. Like, in the 1960s and 70s, there was a sexual revolution that made people more open about sexuality and less bound by traditional norms.\n\nSo, option D says premarital sex has become more permissive, which seems to align with what I think.\n\nBut what about extramarital sex? Has it become less accepting?\n\nI think extramarital sex is still widely viewed as wrong, and maybe even more so with the rise of certain moral movements or something.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps I should look at it from a historical perspective.\n\nIn the past, premarital sex was heavily stigmatized, and people who engaged in it might face social repercussions, like being ostracized or judged.\n\nBut now, it's much more common and accepted. For example, many people live together before getting married, which was uncommon a few decades ago.\n\nSo, for premarital sex, it's clear that attitudes have become more permissive.\n\nNow, for extramarital sex, I think it's always been considered wrong, at least in monogamous relationships.\n\nBut maybe there are some shifts, like in open relationships or certain cultural shifts where people are more accepting of affairs under certain circumstances.\n\nHowever, I think overall, extramarital sex is still largely viewed negatively.\n\nSo, based on that, option D seems correct: premarital sex has become more permissive, and extramarital sex has become less accepting.\n\nWait, but the way the options are phrased, option D says \"become more permissive; become less accepting.\"\n\nSo, premarital sex more permissive (which I agree), and extramarital sex less accepting (which seems contradictory to my initial thought that it's always been negative).\n\nBut maybe there's a twist here.\n\nPerhaps extramarital sex was always seen negatively, and it remains so, meaning it hasn't become less accepting because it was already not accepted.\n\nSo, maybe option C is better: remained constant; become less accepting.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense because if it remained constant, it wouldn't be less accepting unless there was a change.\n\nI think I'm getting confused with the wording.\n\nLet me rephrase it in my mind.\n\nAttitudes toward premarital sex have become more permissive over the past several decades; attitudes toward extramarital sex have become less accepting.\n\nIs that accurate?\n\nYes, I think so.\n\nPremarital sex is more accepted now than it was before, while extramarital sex is still largely unacceptable, perhaps even more so with stronger emphasis on fidelity in relationships.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure about the trend in extramarital sex acceptance.\n\nMaybe I should consider specific examples or studies.\n\nI recall that in some surveys, the percentage of people who think extramarital sex is always wrong has increased or stayed the same, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's been a shift in how people view extramarital sex, perhaps with more emphasis on individual circumstances.\n\nBut overall, I think extramarital sex is still largely viewed negatively, and maybe even more so in recent times.\n\nSo, perhaps option D is the correct one: premarital sex has become more permissive, and extramarital sex has become less accepting.\n\nYes, that seems to make sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
