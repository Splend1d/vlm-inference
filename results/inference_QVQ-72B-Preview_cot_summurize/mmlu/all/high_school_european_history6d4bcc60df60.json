A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rh\u00e9tel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the cur\u00e9, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery fire.\n\u2014Report of the Estates of Normandy, 1651\nWhich of the following would be most responsible for ending the problems of hunger mentioned above?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about ending hunger in a historical context, specifically referring to a report from the Estates of Normandy in 1651. The report describes a dire situation where people are starving, eating mice and rotten roots, and even resorting to eating diseased animals. It's pretty grim. The question is asking which of the given options would be most responsible for ending the problems of hunger mentioned in this report.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A mentions the elimination of the Black Plague in Europe during the seventeenth century. Now, the Black Plague was a massive epidemic that caused significant population decline in the 14th century, but by the 17th century, while there were still outbreaks, it wasn't as prevalent as before. However, the report is about hunger and famine, which can be caused by various factors like crop failures, war, or poor distribution of resources. The Black Plague directly caused death and disruption, but its elimination wouldn't necessarily address the underlying causes of famine and hunger described in the report.\n\nOption B talks about the elimination of fallow fields through the agricultural revolution during the seventeenth century. Fallow fields are fields that are left unplanted to restore nutrients in the soil. However, this practice can limit the amount of land available for cultivation, potentially leading to food shortages, especially in dense populations. If the agricultural revolution found ways to rotate crops or use fertilizers to keep lands productive without fallow periods, that could increase food production significantly. This seems directly relevant to addressing hunger by increasing food supplies.\n\nOption C mentions the creation of a strong putting-out system that allowed people to be paid for their work. The putting-out system was a early form of outsourcing where merchants would provide raw materials to workers, often in rural areas, who would process them and then return the finished products. This system could provide employment and income to people, which in turn could help them purchase food. So, while it might improve economic conditions and thus people's ability to access food, it doesn't directly address the availability or production of food itself.\n\nOption D refers to a declining population during the seventeenth century that led to better food yields and less hunger as Europe urbanized. While it's true that a declining population could reduce the demand for food, leading to more abundant supplies per person, this doesn't explain how the production of food improved. Moreover, the seventeenth century saw varying population trends in Europe, with some areas experiencing growth and others decline due to factors like disease, war, and emigration.\n\nConsidering the context of the report, which describes extreme hunger and famine conditions in 1651, the most direct way to address these issues would be to increase food production. Option B suggests that eliminating fallow fields through agricultural advancements increased food production, which aligns closely with what would be needed to combat famine and hunger.\n\nAdditionally, the agricultural revolution of the seventeenth century introduced new crops, improved farming techniques, and better tools, all of which contributed to higher yields and more efficient food production. This would have had a substantial impact on reducing hunger by ensuring a more stable and abundant food supply.\n\nIn contrast, options A, C, and D either address different aspects that are less directly connected to food production or suggest changes that might not have been as widespread or impactful in the seventeenth century.\n\nTherefore, the most responsible factor for ending the problems of hunger mentioned in the report would be the elimination of fallow fields through the agricultural revolution during the seventeenth century, as stated in option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
