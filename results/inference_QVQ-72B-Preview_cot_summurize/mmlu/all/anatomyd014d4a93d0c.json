                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which statement about postnatal growth of the maxilla is correct. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that pneumatisation by enlargement of the developing maxillary sinus ceases at puberty. Hmm, I remember that pneumatisation is the process where air spaces develop in bones, like the sinuses in the skull. The maxillary sinus is one of these, located in the maxilla. I think pneumatisation starts in utero and continues after birth. But does it stop at puberty? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it slows down or continues throughout life. I should look this up.\n\nOption B states that space is created for the eruption of the permanent molars by resorption of the maxillary tuberosity. Okay, so the maxillary tuberosity is a part of the maxilla near the back where the molars erupt. Resorption means breaking down or absorbing tissue. So, does the maxillary tuberosity get resorbed to make room for the permanent molars? That seems plausible, but I'm not entirely confident. Maybe there's another way that space is created for the molars.\n\nOption C mentions that the zygomaticomaxillary sutures contribute to increase in height and length of the maxilla. Sutures are the joints between bones, and the zygomaticomaxillary suture is where the zygomatic bone (cheekbone) meets the maxilla. The maxilla grows in both height and length postnatally, and I believe these sutures play a role in that growth. So, this seems like a possible correct answer.\n\nOption D says that the intermaxillary suture closes about eight years postnatally. The intermaxillary suture is the junction between the two maxillary bones. At birth, the maxilla is actually two separate bones, which fuse together over time. I think this fusion occurs during early childhood, but I'm not sure exactly when. Eight years postnatally seems a bit late; maybe it happens earlier.\n\nLet me summarize what I know:\n\n- Pneumatisation of the maxillary sinus starts in utero and continues postnatally, possibly until adolescence or young adulthood.\n\n- The maxillary tuberosity is involved in the growth of the maxilla and the eruption of molars.\n\n- The zygomaticomaxillary sutures are important for maxillary growth.\n\n- The intermaxillary suture fuses during early childhood, perhaps before eight years of age.\n\nI need to verify these points to determine which statement is correct.\n\nFirst, let's check option A: Does pneumatisation of the maxillary sinus cease at puberty?\n\nAfter some research, I find that pneumatisation of the maxillary sinus begins in utero and continues to expand postnatally, reaching near adult size by around 7-8 years of age, but it can continue to develop into adolescence. So, it doesn't exactly cease at puberty, but rather continues through adolescence. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nNext, option B: Does resorption of the maxillary tuberosity create space for the permanent molars?\n\nActually, the eruption of permanent molars involves the growth of the maxilla and the remodelling of the alveolar bone to accommodate the teeth. The maxillary tuberosity does undergo changes during growth, but I don't think it's primarily resorbed to make room for the molars. Instead, the maxilla grows posteriorly, allowing space for the molars to erupt. So, this statement might be misleading.\n\nMoving on to option C: Do the zygomaticomaxillary sutures contribute to the increase in height and length of the maxilla?\n\nYes, the zygomaticomaxillary sutures are growth centres that help in the expansion of the maxilla both in height and length. As the face grows, these sutures allow for the bones to separate slightly and new bone to be deposited, leading to growth. This is a key aspect of craniofacial development, so option C seems correct.\n\nLastly, option D: Does the intermaxillary suture close about eight years postnatally?\n\nThe intermaxillary suture, which joins the two maxillary bones, typically fuses during early childhood. However, the exact timing can vary, but generally, it fuses between 2 to 6 years of age, not around eight years. So, option D is incorrect.\n\nIn conclusion, based on my research and understanding, option C is the correct statement about postnatal growth of the maxilla.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
