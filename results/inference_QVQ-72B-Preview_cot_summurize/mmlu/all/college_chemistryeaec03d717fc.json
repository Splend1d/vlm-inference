                    "text": "So I have this question about the infrared-active normal modes of a carbon dioxide molecule. It's asking which of the following modes are infrared-active: bending, symmetric stretching, or asymmetric stretching. The options are A. I only, B. II only, C. III only, D. I and III only.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what makes a molecular vibration infrared-active. I remember that for a vibration to be infrared-active, it must involve a change in the dipole moment of the molecule. So, if the molecule's dipole moment changes during the vibration, then that mode will absorb infrared radiation.\n\nNow, carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) is a linear molecule with the structure O=C=O. It has three atoms, so the number of normal modes of vibration can be calculated using the formula 3N - 5 for nonlinear molecules or 3N - 6 for linear molecules, where N is the number of atoms. Since CO\u2082 is linear, it should have 3*3 - 6 = 9 - 6 = 3 normal modes of vibration.\n\nLet's list out the three normal modes for CO\u2082:\n\n1. Symmetric stretching: Both oxygen atoms move towards and away from the carbon atom in phase, meaning they move together simultaneously. So, the bond lengths change equally.\n\n2. Asymmetric stretching: Both oxygen atoms move towards and away from the carbon atom out of phase, meaning one moves while the other moves in the opposite direction.\n\n3. Bending: The oxygen atoms move perpendicular to the molecular axis, causing the molecule to bend.\n\nNow, I need to determine which of these modes involve a change in the dipole moment.\n\nFirst, consider the symmetric stretching mode. In this mode, both bonds are stretching equally, so the dipole moments due to each bond change in the same way. However, since the molecule is symmetric, the overall dipole moment might not change. Let's think about this carefully.\n\nIn CO\u2082, the C=O bonds are polar because oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, so each bond has a dipole moment directed from carbon to oxygen. But since the molecule is linear and symmetric, the two bond dipoles cancel each other out, resulting in a net dipole moment of zero. During symmetric stretching, both bonds stretch equally, so their individual dipole moments might increase or decrease similarly, but their vector sum would still cancel out, meaning no net change in the dipole moment. Therefore, the symmetric stretching mode should not be infrared-active.\n\nNext, consider the asymmetric stretching mode. Here, one bond is stretching while the other is compressing, so their dipole moments are changing differently. This should result in a change in the net dipole moment of the molecule because the individual dipole changes are not canceling each other out. Therefore, this mode should be infrared-active.\n\nNow, for the bending mode. In this vibration, the molecule bends, so the linear symmetry is broken temporarily. This means that the dipole moments of the bonds no longer cancel each other completely, leading to a net change in the dipole moment. Therefore, the bending mode should also be infrared-active.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the asymmetric stretching and the bending modes are infrared-active, while the symmetric stretching mode is not.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check this because I recall that in some molecules, only certain modes are infrared-active, and it's possible that in CO\u2082, only two out of the three modes are infrared-active. Let me see.\n\nUpon a quick search in my memory, I recall that in CO\u2082, indeed, only two modes are infrared-active: the asymmetric stretching and the bending modes. The symmetric stretching mode is not infrared-active because, as I reasoned earlier, there is no net change in the dipole moment due to its symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. I and III only, where I is bending and III is asymmetric stretching.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about the selection rules again. For a vibration to be infrared-active, the derivative of the dipole moment with respect to the normal coordinate must be nonzero. This is essentially what I said earlier: there needs to be a change in dipole moment during the vibration.\n\nIn CO\u2082, the molecule is linear and has a center of symmetry. The symmetric stretching mode is totally symmetric and doesn't change the dipole moment, hence it's infrared-inactive. The asymmetric stretching and bending modes break this symmetry and do result in a change in dipole moment, making them infrared-active.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. I and III only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
