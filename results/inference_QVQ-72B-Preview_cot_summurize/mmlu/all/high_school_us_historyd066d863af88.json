                    "text": "So I'm reading this passage from William Bradford's History of Plymouth Plantation, and it's about the early interactions between the Pilgrims and the Native Americans. Specifically, it talks about two Native Americans, Samoset and Squanto, who could speak English and interacted with the colonists. The question is asking which option best expresses Bradford's perspective based on this passage.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The Pilgrims arrived in Plymouth in 1620, and they had to establish relations with the indigenous people of the area. The passage mentions that the Indians would come around but keep their distance, sometimes showing themselves from afar but running away when approached closely. However, around March 16th, Samoset approached boldly and spoke to them in broken English. The colonists were surprised but could understand him. Samoset had learned English from English fishermen in the eastern parts of North America.\n\nSamoset provided valuable information about the surrounding area, including details about the local tribes, their names, numbers, strengths, locations, and distances from Plymouth. He also mentioned another Native American named Squanto, who was from Plymouth and had been to England, speaking English even better than Samoset.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. The only good Indian is a dead Indian.\n\nThis is a notoriously xenophobic and genocidal sentiment often attributed to some figures in American history, particularly in the 19th century during the Indian Wars. However, William Bradford was a Puritan leader in the 17th century and, based on this passage, seems to be approaching the Native Americans with curiosity and a desire to understand and possibly cooperate with them, at least initially. There's no indication in this passage of hostility or a desire to harm the Native Americans. In fact, their knowledge and language skills are presented as beneficial to the colonists.\n\nB. The native peoples of America need to be converted to Christianity.\n\nWhile it's true that many European colonists saw it as their mission to convert the Native Americans to Christianity, this particular passage doesn't mention anything about religion or conversion efforts. It focuses solely on the interaction and the exchange of information, particularly highlighting the language abilities of Samoset and Squanto.\n\nC. Native Americans need to be incorporated into their new colony.\n\nAgain, this option suggests a policy of inclusion or assimilation, which might or might not have been Bradford's view, but the passage doesn't provide any direct evidence for this. It simply describes the encounter and the information gained from Samoset.\n\nD. Surprise that Native Americans could learn English and serve as cultural intermediaries.\n\nThis seems to align closely with what's described in the passage. The colonists were marveled at Samoset's ability to speak English and were surprised to learn that there were Native Americans who had been to England and could communicate effectively with them. This surprise is natural given that the colonists were likely expecting little to no communication with the locals beyond basic signs and gestures.\n\nMoreover, the passage highlights the potential benefits of having such intermediaries, as Samoset provided valuable information about the surrounding areas and the local tribes. This suggests that Bradford saw value in these relationships and recognized the utility of having people who could bridge the cultural and linguistic divide between the colonists and the Native Americans.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the passage, option D seems to be the best expression of Bradford's perspective. It accurately reflects the colonists' surprise at the linguistic abilities of Samoset and Squanto and acknowledges their role as cultural intermediaries, which was likely a significant factor in the early years of the Plymouth colony.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is just one passage and may not fully represent Bradford's overall views on Native Americans. Historical context is crucial here: while Bradford and the Pilgrits did initially seek peaceful relations with the Native Americans, tensions did rise over time due to various factors, including land disputes and different understandings of property and sovereignty.\n\nBut based solely on this passage, option D is the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
