                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about suspended passive activity losses. I need to figure out which statement is correct regarding how these suspended losses can be used by an individual. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that $3,000 of suspended losses can be utilized each year against portfolio income. Hmm, I don't recall a specific dollar amount like $3,000 being applied to passive activity losses. I know that passive losses are generally suspended and can be used to offset future passive income, but there isn't a limit of $3,000 per year. Maybe I'm missing something, but this seems off.\n\nOption B states that suspended losses can be carried forward, but not back, until utilized. This sounds familiar. I think passive activity losses are suspended and can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future passive income. But can they be carried back? I don't think so. Passive losses generally can't be carried back to previous years to adjust prior tax returns. So, this option seems plausible.\n\nOption C claims that suspended losses must be carried back three years and forward seven years. This contradicts what I just thought about option B. If I remember correctly, passive losses don't have to be carried back; in fact, they can't be carried back to previous years. The idea of carrying them back three years and forward seven years sounds more like the treatment of net operating losses under certain tax regulations, but not specifically for passive activity losses. So, this might not be correct.\n\nOption D suggests that a maximum of 50% of the suspended losses can be used each year when an election is made to forgo the carryback period. Again, I'm not sure about this. I don't recall any election to forgo a carryback period for passive activity losses. This seems confusing because, as I understand, passive losses are suspended and carried forward automatically without a carryback option.\n\nLet me summarize what I know about passive activity losses. The passive activity loss rules generally prevent taxpayers from using passive activity losses to offset non-passive income, like salary or portfolio income. Instead, these losses are suspended and can be used in future years to offset passive income when it becomes available. They can also be deducted when the passive activity is disposed of in a fully taxable transaction.\n\nGiven this, option B seems to align with my understanding: suspended losses can be carried forward, but not back, until utilized. I don't think there's a requirement to carry them back, as option C suggests, and option D seems to introduce an election that I'm not familiar with regarding passive losses.\n\nI should also consider if there are any exceptions or special rules that might apply in certain circumstances. For example, if an individual is no longer involved in the passive activity, they might be able to deduct the suspended losses against other income, but that's more about the disposition of the activity rather than annual usage.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the individual is an active participant in rental real estate activities. If so, there might be some exceptions allowing for larger deductions, but again, nothing that matches the specifics in the options provided.\n\nI think the best answer among these options is B: suspended losses can be carried forward, but not back, until utilized. This seems to be the most accurate statement based on my understanding of passive activity loss rules.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll double-check each option:\n\n- A: $3,000 limit against portfolio income \u2013 Doesn't ring a bell; passive losses generally can't be used against portfolio income.\n\n- B: Carried forward, not back \u2013 Aligns with passive loss rules.\n\n- C: Must be carried back three years and forward seven years \u2013 This sounds like the treatment for net operating losses under older tax laws, but it's not applicable to passive activity losses.\n\n- D: 50% usage per year with an election to forgo carryback \u2013 No knowledge of such an election or limitation for passive losses.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that option B is the correct statement regarding suspended passive activity losses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
