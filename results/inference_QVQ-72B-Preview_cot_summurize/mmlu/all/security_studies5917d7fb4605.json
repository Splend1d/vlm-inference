The question is asking which techniques and targets belong to a workable definition of terrorism and terrorist concerns, and the options are:\n\nA. Suicide attacks have been employed by terrorists having the advantage of enabling detonation at the last minute or when casualties will be maximized. A potential future danger is that a suicide attack could be combined with the use of chemical, biological or radiological weapons.\n\nB. The ability to find vulnerable targets may be greater in democratic states since there are limitations on how much a government can monitor its citizen and will, in the event of an attack, generate more publicity. However, security forces in weak non-democratic countries also provide conditions conducive to terrorist activity, enabling relative freedom of operation and movement.\n\nC. WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction) have not been used very often, requiring high levels of resources and trained personnel for use. Furthermore, most terrorist groups still prefer to use more predictable methods for inflicting maximum casualties on the target. Yet to some extent, terrorist groups have gained a psychological edge because of the fear of use of WMD.\n\nD. All of these options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes a workable definition of terrorism and terrorist concerns. Terrorism is generally understood as the use of violence or intimidation, often for political purposes, targeted against civilians or non-combatants.\n\nOption A talks about suicide attacks and their potential combination with chemical, biological, or radiological weapons. Suicide attacks are indeed a tactic used by some terrorist groups, and combining them with WMD could increase their destructive potential. This seems relevant to terrorist concerns.\n\nOption B discusses the vulnerability of democratic states due to limitations on government monitoring and the potential for greater publicity from attacks. It also mentions that weak non-democratic countries can provide a conducive environment for terrorist activities. This seems to address the targets and the environments where terrorism can thrive.\n\nOption C mentions that WMD haven't been used often by terrorists because they require significant resources and trained personnel, and that terrorists prefer more predictable methods for causing casualties. However, the fear of WMD use gives terrorists a psychological advantage.\n\nAll of these options seem to relate to techniques used by terrorists (suicide attacks and potential use of WMD) and the types of targets or environments they might focus on (vulnerable points in democratic or weak non-democratic states). Therefore, it seems that all of these options are relevant to a workable definition of terrorism and terrorist concerns.\n\nBut I should think deeper to make sure. Let's consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Option A: Suicide attacks are a specific tactic used by some terrorist groups, notably in certain regions and contexts. They are designed to cause maximum harm and are often symbolic acts intended to send a message beyond just the immediate impact. The idea of combining suicide attacks with WMD is a concern because it could amplify the effects and spread fear more widely. So, this is definitely a part of terrorist concerns.\n\nOption B: This option talks about the ability to find vulnerable targets in democratic states due to limitations on government monitoring and the potential for greater publicity. Democracies often have open societies with fewer restrictions on movement and information, which can make them more susceptible to certain types of attacks. Additionally, attacks in democratic countries can generate significant media coverage, which terrorists might seek for their causes. The option also mentions that weak non-democratic countries can provide a safe haven for terrorists, allowing them to operate and move more freely without strong law enforcement or security measures. This dual perspective on both types of regimes is important for understanding where terrorist activities might be planned or executed.\n\nOption C: The use of WMD by terrorists is a significant concern, even if it hasn't been common yet. The reasons provided are that WMD require high levels of resources and trained personnel, which many terrorist groups lack. Moreover, conventional methods are seen as more predictable for inflicting casualties. However, the mere possibility of WMD use can create a disproportionate amount of fear and anxiety in the general public, giving terrorists a psychological upper hand.\n\nGiven all this, it seems that each option contributes to a comprehensive understanding of terrorism and terrorist concerns. Suicide attacks are a current reality, vulnerabilities in different types of governments are relevant targets, and the threat of WMD, even if not frequently used, is a persistent fear.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer should be D: All of these options.\n\nTo ensure I'm not missing something, I should consider if there's any overlap or if one option might be less relevant than the others. For example, Option A focuses on specific tactics and potential future threats, Option B on the types of targets and environments, and Option C on the use of WMD. All three are distinct but interconnected aspects of terrorism and terrorist concerns.\n\nMoreover, a workable definition of terrorism should encompass not only the methods used but also the targets and the environments in which terrorism operates. So, including all three options makes sense.\n\nIn conclusion, the techniques and targets that belong to a workable definition of terrorism and terrorist concerns include suicide attacks and their potential combination with WMD, the vulnerabilities in democratic and weak non-democratic states as targets, and the considerations around the use of WMD by terrorist groups. Therefore, the correct answer is D: All of these options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
