That language is a uniquely human skill.\n\nC. That primates can make and use tools.\n\nD. The danger of separating babies from their natural parents.\n\nI need to figure out which one correctly describes what Harlow's monkey experiment illustrated.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what Harlow's monkey experiment was about. I think Harry Harlow did some studies with rhesus monkeys, especially focusing on attachment and mother-infant relationships. He used surrogate mothers, like wire and cloth mommies, to see how monkeys would interact with them.\n\nLet me think about this. Harlow placed baby monkeys with two fake mothers: one made of wire with a wooden head that provided milk, and another made of wire covered with terry cloth that didn't provide milk. He observed that the babies spent more time with the cloth mother, even though the wire mother gave them food. This suggested that comfort and contact comfort were important for the babies.\n\nSo, this seems to highlight the importance of physical contact and comfort in development, which aligns with option A.\n\nOption B is about language being uniquely human. I don't recall Harlow's experiments involving language development in monkeys. His studies were more about social and emotional development, particularly attachment. So, this probably isn't the right choice.\n\nOption C says that primates can make and use tools. Again, Harlow's work wasn't focused on tool-making or tool-use in primates. I think Jane Goodall observed chimpanzees using tools in the wild, but not Harlow with his rhesus monkeys.\n\nOption D mentions the danger of separating babies from their natural parents. While Harlow's experiments did show negative effects of separation, like anxiety and social difficulties in the monkeys, the primary focus was on the nature of attachment and the comfort provided by physical contact, not solely on the risks of separation.\n\nSo, based on this, I think option A is the most accurate description of what Harlow's monkey experiment illustrated: the importance of physical contact to development.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check. Harlow's work did indeed emphasize the role of tactile comfort in forming attachments, which is crucial for healthy psychological development in infants. His experiments showed that mere provision of food isn't sufficient for emotional bonding; physical contact and comfort are essential components.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. The importance of physical contact to development.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
