                    "text": "So I've got this question here from the Bible about Moses and Aaron's sister. The options are Jochebed, Ruth, Leah, and Miriam. I need to figure out which one is correctly identified as their sister.\n\nFirst off, I know that Moses and Aaron are prominent figures in the Old Testament, especially in the book of Exodus. They were instrumental in leading the Israelites out of Egypt. So, their immediate family is also mentioned in the Bible.\n\nLet me recall: Moses had a sister who is famous for watching him as a baby when he was set adrift in the Nile River. I think her name was Miriam. Wait, is that right? Let me think carefully.\n\nI remember the story: Pharaoh had ordered all male Hebrew children to be killed, so Moses' mother placed him in a basket in the river to save him. His sister then followed to make sure he was safe and ended up arranging for Pharaoh's daughter to adopt him. Yes, that sounds familiar.\n\nSo, that sister was Miriam. Let me confirm that. In Exodus chapter 2, it says that Moses' mother put him in the river, and his sister stood watching from a distance. When Pharaoh's daughter found him, the sister approached and suggested that she find a Hebrew nurse for the baby. So, yes, that sister was Miriam.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, let's consider the other options.\n\nJochebed: I believe Jochebed was the mother of Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. So, she's their mother, not their sister.\n\nRuth: Ruth is a different biblical figure. She's known for her loyalty to her mother-in-law, Naomi, and is celebrated in the Book of Ruth. She wasn't related to Moses or Aaron.\n\nLeah: Leah was the wife of Jacob and the mother of several of his sons, including Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin. She lived much earlier than Moses and Aaron, so she couldn't be their sister.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Miriam.\n\nWait a minute, just to double-check, I'll look up Exodus chapter 2 again. It says, \"But a man of the house of Levi went and took as his wife a Levite woman. She became pregnant and gave birth to a son, and when she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months. But when she could hide him no longer, she took a papyrus basket and daubed it with asphalt and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile. His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.\"\n\nThen, when Pharaoh's daughter comes and finds the baby, \"His sister said to her, 'Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?' Pharaoh's daughter said to her, 'Yes, go.' So the girl went and called the child's mother. Pharaoh's daughter said to her, 'Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.' So she took the baby and nursed him.\"\n\nSo, clearly, the sister who watched over Moses was Miriam. Therefore, the correct choice is D. Miriam.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\text{ Miriam}} \\]"
