The LRAS represents the total output of goods and services that an economy can produce at full employment, and a rightward shift means an increase in that potential output.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that a nation devotes more resources to nondurable consumption goods rather than durable capital goods. So, if a country is focusing more on things like food, clothing, and other consumables that don't last long, rather than investing in things like machinery, buildings, or equipment that can increase future production capacity, would that shift LRAS to the right?\n\nI don't think so. In fact, investing in capital goods usually helps to increase an economy's productive capacity over time. So, if a country is diverting resources away from capital goods and into consumption goods, that might actually decrease its long-run productive capacity. So, this might shift LRAS to the left, not to the right.\n\nOption B mentions research that improves the productivity of labor and capital. This sounds promising. If research leads to better ways of producing things, making workers more efficient or capital more productive, that should increase the economy's ability to produce goods and services in the long run. So, this seems like it would shift LRAS to the right.\n\nOption C talks about more restrictive trade policies. Hmm, I need to think about this carefully. Restrictive trade policies, like tariffs or quotas, can make it harder for a country to import goods or services. This might protect domestic industries in the short term but could lead to less competition and potentially less efficiency in the long run.\n\nIf trade policies become more restrictive, it might limit the access to cheaper inputs or technologies from abroad, which could hinder productivity growth. That suggests that more restrictive trade policies could shift LRAS to the left, not to the right.\n\nOption D mentions annual limits to immigration of foreign citizens. Immigration can affect the labor force size and composition, which in turn affects the economy's productive capacity.\n\nIf immigration increases the labor force, it can lead to an increase in production capacity, assuming that the additional workers are employed productively. Conversely, setting limits to immigration might reduce the growth of the labor force, which could limit the economy's ability to produce more in the long run.\n\nSo, imposing annual limits on immigration might slow down the growth of the labor force and, therefore, not shift LRAS to the right.\n\nBased on this analysis, option B seems to be the correct answer because improving the productivity of labor and capital through research should lead to an increase in the economy's potential output, shifting LRAS to the right.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if there's any way that option B could potentially shift LRAS to the left. I don't think so. Improving productivity generally means that the economy can produce more with the same amount of resources, which should always shift LRAS to the right.\n\nAlright, I'm confident that option B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
