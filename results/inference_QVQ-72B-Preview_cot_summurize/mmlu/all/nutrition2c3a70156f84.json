                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about the thermic effect of food. It's been a while since I studied nutrition, but I think I can work through this.\n\nFirst off, the thermic effect of food (TEF) is the energy required to digest, absorb, and metabolize the nutrients in food. It's like the calories you burn just by eating. So, different macronutrients have different TEFs.\n\nOption A says that the TEF is substantially higher for carbohydrate than for protein. Hmm, I thought protein had a higher TEF compared to carbs. Let me double-check that. I recall that protein requires more energy to digest because it involves breaking down into amino acids and then processing those. So, actually, protein has a higher TEF than carbs. So, option A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B says that the TEF is accompanied by a slight decrease in body core temperature. Now, when you eat, your metabolism speeds up due to TEF, which should generate heat, right? So, I would think that body temperature might increase slightly, not decrease. Maybe it's different for different people or depends on the type of food, but generally, I don't think TEF causes a decrease in body core temperature. So, probably not B.\n\nOption C mentions that the TEF is partly related to sympathetic activity stimulation in the postprandial phase. The postprandial phase is after eating, right? And the sympathetic nervous system is involved in fight-or-flight responses, but it also plays a role in metabolic processes. I think eating can stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, especially if the meal is high in protein or certain other nutrients. So, this seems plausible. Maybe C is correct.\n\nOption D says that the TEF is not attenuated by food malabsorption. Malabsorption means that the body isn't absorbing nutrients properly. If that's the case, then less energy is being extracted from the food, so perhaps less energy is being spent on digesting it. But I'm not sure. Maybe the TEF is lower in cases of malabsorption because less work is being done by the digestive system. So, if that's the case, then option D would be incorrect.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- A seems incorrect because protein has a higher TEF than carbs.\n\n- B seems incorrect because TEF should increase body temperature, not decrease it.\n\n- C seems plausible because eating can stimulate the sympathetic nervous system.\n\n- D seems possibly incorrect because malabsorption might reduce TEF.\n\nTherefore, the most likely correct answer is C. The thermic effect of food is partly related to sympathetic activity stimulation in the postprandial phase.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check some quick references to confirm.\n\nFirst, regarding A: Yes, protein has a higher TEF than carbohydrates. Typically, protein's TEF is about 20-30% of the energy ingested, while carbs are about 5-10%. So, A is incorrect.\n\nFor B: The TEF actually increases body core temperature slightly due to the increased metabolic activity. So, B is incorrect.\n\nFor C: Sympathetic nervous system activity does increase after meals, particularly in response to certain nutrients like protein and fats. This can contribute to increased metabolic rate and heat production. So, C seems correct.\n\nFor D: In cases of malabsorption, since nutrients aren't being absorbed properly, the body might not need to spend as much energy processing them, leading to a reduced TEF. So, D is likely incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
