                    "text": "So I've got this question here about three major life tasks: friendship, occupation, and love. It's asking which philosopher's ideas are most consistent with this notion, and the options are Perls, Berne, Rogers, or Adler. Hmm, I need to recall what each of these theorists is known for, especially regarding their views on life tasks.\n\nFirst off, let's think about Alfred Adler. He was an Austrian medical doctor and psychologist who developed individual psychology. Adler emphasized the social nature of human beings and the importance of community feeling. He talked about the striving for superiority, but not in a negative way. Instead, it's about perfection and self-improvement. But does he specifically mention friendship, occupation, and love as the three major life tasks?\n\nLet me dig a bit deeper. I remember that Adler considered social interest, or the concern for the welfare of others, as crucial for mental health. He also discussed the importance of work, friendship, and love in a person's life. Wait, that sounds familiar. Maybe he did refer to these as key areas.\n\nNow, let's consider Carl Rogers. He was an American psychologist who developed person-centered therapy. Rogers emphasized the importance of self-actualization and unconditional positive regard. His theory revolves around the self-concept and the need for positive regard from others. While he talked about relationships and personal growth, I don't recall him specifically focusing on friendship, occupation, and love as distinct life tasks.\n\nThen there's Fritz Perls, who was a German-born psychotherapist and the founder of Gestalt therapy. Perls emphasized living in the present moment and taking responsibility for one's own experiences. His approach is more about awareness and integration of different parts of the self. Again, I don't think he specifically outlined friendship, occupation, and love as the main life tasks.\n\nEric Berne, on the other hand, was a Canadian-born psychiatrist who developed transactional analysis (TA). TA focuses on social interactions and the structure of personality. Berne analyzed relationships in terms of parent, adult, and child ego states. While his work touches on relationships and social transactions, I don't recall any specific emphasis on friendship, occupation, and love as life tasks.\n\nComparing all these, Adler seems to be the one who talked about work, friendship, and love as important areas in a person's life. In fact, I think he referred to them as the three main problems of life that every individual must face and resolve. He believed that how we handle these areas significantly affects our mental health and overall well-being.\n\nLet me double-check this. Adler's individual psychology holds that humans have an innate drive to overcome inferiority feelings and to strive for perfection. This striving is expressed through our approach to these three areas: work (occupation), friendship (social relationships), and love (intimate relationships). So, yes, this aligns perfectly with the notion presented in the question.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly recap why the other options aren't as fitting:\n\n- Perls: Gestalt therapy focuses on present awareness and self-integration, without specifically highlighting these three life tasks.\n\n- Berne: Transactional analysis looks at social transactions and ego states, but doesn't emphasize these particular life tasks.\n\n- Rogers: Person-centered therapy emphasizes self-actualization and positive regard, but doesn't specifically single out friendship, occupation, and love as the main life tasks.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Adler.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
