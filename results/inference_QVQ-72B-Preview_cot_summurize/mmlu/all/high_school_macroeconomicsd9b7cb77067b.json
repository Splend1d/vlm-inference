                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which combination of fiscal and monetary policy would help reduce a recessionary gap. First off, I need to understand what a recessionary gap is. From what I remember in economics class, a recessionary gap occurs when the actual GDP is less than the potential GDP, meaning the economy is producing below its capacity, and there's unemployment.\n\nTo close this gap, we need to stimulate the economy, increase aggregate demand, and get people back to work. So, I need to look for policies that will boost spending and production.\n\nLet's recall the differences between fiscal and monetary policy:\n\n- **Fiscal policy** involves government spending and taxation. Increasing government spending or decreasing taxes can stimulate the economy.\n\n- **Monetary policy** involves managing the money supply and interest rates, typically carried out by the central bank. Increasing the money supply or decreasing interest rates can encourage borrowing and spending.\n\nGiven that, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A: Increase taxes and increase the reserve ratio.**\n\n- **Increase taxes:** This is contractionary fiscal policy because higher taxes reduce disposable income, leading to decreased consumer spending.\n\n- **Increase the reserve ratio:** This is contractionary monetary policy because it reduces the amount of money banks can lend, leading to less investment spending.\n\nBoth of these policies are contractionary, which would make the recessionary gap worse by decreasing demand further.\n\n**Option B: Decrease spending and sell Treasury securities.**\n\n- **Decrease spending:** This is also contractionary fiscal policy, as reduced government spending leads to direct decreases in aggregate demand.\n\n- **Sell Treasury securities:** This is contractionary monetary policy because when the central bank sells Treasury securities, it reduces the money supply in the economy, leading to higher interest rates and decreased investment spending.\n\nAgain, both policies are contractionary, which isn't helpful for closing a recessionary gap.\n\n**Option C: Decrease taxes and buy Treasury securities.**\n\n- **Decrease taxes:** This is expansionary fiscal policy because lower taxes increase disposable income, leading to increased consumer spending.\n\n- **Buy Treasury securities:** This is expansionary monetary policy because when the central bank buys Treasury securities, it increases the money supply, leading to lower interest rates and increased investment spending.\n\nBoth of these policies are expansionary, which should help close the recessionary gap by increasing aggregate demand.\n\n**Option D: Increase spending and increase the reserve ratio.**\n\n- **Increase spending:** This is expansionary fiscal policy because higher government spending directly increases aggregate demand.\n\n- **Increase the reserve ratio:** This is contractionary monetary policy, as it reduces lending and investment.\n\nHere, we have a mix of expansionary and contractionary policies. The net effect would depend on which policy is stronger, but ideally, we want policies that work together to stimulate the economy.\n\nGiven these considerations, Option C seems to be the best choice because both fiscal and monetary policies are working in the same direction to increase aggregate demand and close the recessionary gap.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about which combination would be most effective. Increasing spending (Option D) is also expansionary fiscal policy, but coupled with increasing the reserve ratio, which is contractionary. So, perhaps Option C is still better because both policies are expansionary.\n\nLet me consider the magnitude of the effects. If I choose Option C, decreasing taxes should stimulate consumer spending, and buying Treasury securities should lower interest rates and encourage investment. That seems like a solid combination.\n\nIn contrast, Option D has increasing government spending, which is good, but increasing the reserve ratio, which is bad. So, the net effect might be less than Option C.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is **Option C: Decrease taxes and buy Treasury securities.**\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
