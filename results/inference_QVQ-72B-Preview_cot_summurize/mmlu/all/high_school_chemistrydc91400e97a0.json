                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have three samples of phenol, each 25.00 mL and approximately 0.10 M. They're titrated with standard KOH solution using cresol red as an indicator. The volumes of KOH needed to reach the endpoint are 31.75 mL, 32.38 mL, and 41.75 mL. We need to figure out why one of the samples required significantly more base.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's happening in this titration. Phenol is a weak acid, and KOH is a strong base. When they react, they should neutralize each other in a 1:1 molar ratio:\n\nC6H5OH + KOH \u2192 C6H5OK + H2O\n\nSo, the number of moles of phenol should equal the number of moles of KOH at the equivalence point.\n\nGiven that, let's calculate the theoretical volume of KOH needed for one sample.\n\nThe molarity of phenol is approximately 0.10 M, and the volume is 25.00 mL.\n\nMoles of phenol = Molarity \u00d7 Volume (in L) = 0.10 mol/L \u00d7 0.025 L = 0.0025 mol\n\nIf the molarity of KOH is known, we can calculate the volume needed.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't give the molarity of KOH. Hmm.\n\nLet's assume that the KOH is also 0.10 M for simplicity, but actually, without knowing the exact molarity of KOH, I can't calculate the exact volume needed.\n\nBut maybe I can find the molarity of KOH from the average of the first two titrations, since they are close to each other, and use that to find the molarity of KOH.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFirst two volumes: 31.75 mL and 32.38 mL. Average is (31.75 + 32.38)/2 = 32.065 mL\n\nThird volume: 41.75 mL, which is significantly higher.\n\nAssuming the first two are accurate, and the third one is anomalous, perhaps due to some contamination.\n\nNow, if the molarity of KOH is unknown, but assuming it's standard, maybe around 0.10 M, similar to phenol.\n\nLet's try to calculate the molarity of KOH using the average volume from the first two titrations.\n\nFrom the first two titrations:\n\nAverage volume of KOH = 32.065 mL\n\nMoles of phenol = 0.10 M \u00d7 0.025 L = 0.0025 mol\n\nAssuming 1:1 stoichiometry:\n\nMoles of KOH = moles of phenol = 0.0025 mol\n\nSo, molarity of KOH = moles of KOH / volume of KOH (in L) = 0.0025 mol / 0.032065 L \u2248 0.078 M\n\nWait, that would mean the KOH is about 0.078 M, not 0.10 M.\n\nHmm, maybe the phenol is not exactly 0.10 M.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenol concentration is not exactly 0.10 M, and that's why the volumes differ.\n\nBut the problem says \"approximately 0.10 M phenol,\" so some variation is expected.\n\nNow, looking at the third titration, which required 41.75 mL of KOH, that's significantly more than the first two.\n\nLet's see what volume of KOH would be needed if the phenol was exactly 0.10 M.\n\nUsing the molarity of KOH we just calculated, approximately 0.078 M.\n\nMoles of phenol = 0.10 M \u00d7 0.025 L = 0.0025 mol\n\nVolume of KOH needed = moles of KOH / molarity of KOH = 0.0025 mol / 0.078 M \u2248 0.03205 L = 32.05 mL\n\nWhich matches the average of the first two titrations, around 32 mL.\n\nBut the third titration required 41.75 mL, which is about 24% more than expected.\n\nSo, why would one sample require more base?\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\nA. The indicator was added too late.\n\nIf the indicator was added too late, perhaps some of the phenol had already reacted with the base before the indicator was present to signal the endpoint. This could lead to an overestimation of the volume of base added, as the reaction might have started before the indicator could detect the equivalence point.\n\nBut, in standard titration procedures, the indicator is added at the beginning, not during the titration. So, it's unlikely that the indicator was added too late.\n\nOption A seems unlikely.\n\nB. The wrong indicator was used.\n\nCresol red is a suitable indicator for the titration of a weak acid like phenol with a strong base. Its color change occurs around pH 7.2 to 8.8, which should be appropriate for the equivalence point of this titration.\n\nIf the wrong indicator was used, say one that changes color at a much higher or lower pH, it could lead to an incorrect endpoint being reached, possibly requiring more base.\n\nHowever, since the problem states that cresol red was used, and it's appropriate for this titration, it's unlikely that the wrong indicator was the cause.\n\nOption B seems possible but not directly supported.\n\nC. There was a base contaminating the unclean beaker.\n\nIf there was a base contaminating the beaker, that base would react with the phenol, consuming some of it before the titration even begins.\n\nAs a result, when you add KOH during the titration, less KOH would be needed to reach the endpoint because some phenol has already been neutralized by the contaminating base.\n\nBut in this case, one sample required significantly more base, which contradicts what would happen with base contamination.\n\nOption C seems unlikely.\n\nD. There was an acid contaminating the unclean beaker.\n\nIf there was an acid contaminating the beaker, this acid would react with the KOH during the titration, consuming some of the base.\n\nTherefore, more KOH would be needed to neutralize both the phenol and the contaminating acid.\n\nThis would lead to a higher volume of KOH being required to reach the endpoint, which matches the observation that one sample required significantly more base.\n\nOption D seems plausible.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully.\n\nIf there's an acid contaminant in the beaker, it will react with the KOH added during the titration:\n\nContaminant acid + KOH \u2192 salt + H2O\n\nThis means that part of the KOH is being used to neutralize the contaminant acid, in addition to the phenol.\n\nTherefore, the total volume of KOH needed to reach the endpoint would be higher than expected for just the phenol.\n\nThis explains why one sample required significantly more base.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct explanation.\n\nLet me just double-check.\n\nIf there was base contamination, as in option C, that would pre-neutralize some of the phenol, leading to less KOH needed, which doesn't match the observation.\n\nIf the indicator was added too late, it might affect the accuracy of the titration, but it's not clear how that would specifically lead to more base being used.\n\nUsing the wrong indicator could potentially lead to an incorrect endpoint, but without knowing what the wrong indicator was, it's hard to say how it would affect the results.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation is option D: there was an acid contaminating the unclean beaker.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD"
