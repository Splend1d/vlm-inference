The question is: According to Adler, firstborn children are more likely than subsequent children in a family to be...\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Sociable\n\nB. Funny\n\nC. Responsible\n\nD. Followers\n\nOkay, I need to recall what Adler said about firstborn children. I remember that Alfred Adler was a psychologist who emphasized the social nature of human beings and the importance of individual creativity and striving for perfection. He believed that birth order can influence personality development.\n\nLet me think about firstborn children. Adler thought that firstborns often take on a lot of responsibility because they're the first and might be expected to set an example for younger siblings. So, they might be more responsible. That sounds like option C.\n\nBut let's consider the other options too. Sociable \u2013 is that something Adler associated with firstborns? Well, firstborns are often seen as leaders rather than followers, so maybe not followers. Funny \u2013 I don't recall Adler emphasizing humor in firstborns. Maybe middle children are funnier, trying to get attention?\n\nWait, maybe I should look back on my notes. Adler believed that firstborns are often more conservative and conformist, perhaps more reliable and dutiful. That again points towards responsible.\n\nOption A, sociable, might apply to middle children who have to navigate between siblings and parents, learning to communicate and compromise.\n\nOption B, funny, might be more associated with later-born children who use humor to stand out or get attention in a family where the older siblings already have established roles.\n\nOption D, followers \u2013 Adler might see firstborns as more inclined to be leaders since they're used to being the oldest and possibly having more influence over younger siblings.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option C, responsible, is the most fitting description for firstborn children according to Adler.\n\nBut just to make sure, I'll double-check. I recall that Adler thought firstborns might feel pressured by parental expectations and the need to set an example, which could lead them to be more conscientious and responsible.\n\nAlso, they might experience more one-on-one time with parents before siblings come along, which could foster a stronger sense of responsibility and duty.\n\nI don't think sociability is specifically linked to firstborns in Adler's theory. Middle children often have to mediate between siblings and parents, which might make them more socially adept and adaptable.\n\nAs for being funny, that seems more like a trait that later-born children might develop as a way to differentiate themselves and seek attention in a family where older siblings already hold prominent roles.\n\nAnd followers \u2013 no, Adler would probably see firstborns as more inclined to lead rather than follow.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Responsible.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
