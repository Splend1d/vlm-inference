                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out what remedy the retiree had at common law before accepting the first rental payment after the initial three-year lease period ended. Let me try to understand the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a retiree who owns a building, and several years ago, an artist signed a three-year lease agreement to rent an apartment in that building for $800 a month. The three-year term has expired, but the artist keeps paying rent, and the retiree keeps accepting it. That suggests that even after the original lease ended, they continued their rental agreement on a month-to-month basis or maybe another type of tenancy.\n\nNow, there's a problem with rats in the building because a restaurant opened next door. The artist can't stand the rats and decides to move to another city, giving notice to the retiree. Since then, the artist hasn't been heard from again.\n\nThe question is asking about the remedy available to the retiree before she accepted the first rental payment after the initial three-year period ended. So, it's about the period right after the original lease term expired but before she accepted any further rent.\n\nAt common law, there are specific rules about what happens when a lease expires but the tenant stays on and the landlord accepts rent. This situation is often referred to as a \"holdover tenancy\" or \"tenancy at sufferance.\"\n\nI recall that when a lease expires but the tenant continues to occupy the property and the landlord accepts rent, it typically creates a new tenancy, often on a month-to-month basis, unless there's an agreement otherwise. However, the question is asking about the remedy before the retiree accepted the first rental payment after the initial lease period ended.\n\nSo, before accepting that first rent payment, what could the retiree do?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Eviction of the artist for non-payment of rent.\n\nBut the artist was paying rent regularly until they decided to move out. It seems like they were current with their rent payments up to that point. So, eviction for non-payment might not apply if the artist was up to date with rent when they gave notice.\n\nB. Recovery of the difference between the lease price and the fair market value of the leasehold for a year.\n\nThis sounds like something related to breach of contract, where the retiree could seek damages for the difference between the contract price and the market price. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Maybe if the artist was paying below market rate, but the retiree was still accepting the rent.\n\nC. Recovery of double the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the number of months the artist was on the premises beyond the three-year period.\n\nThis seems punitive, and I don't recall any common law principle that allows for double rent in this scenario. Maybe if the tenant was holding over without permission, but it seems like the retiree was consenting by accepting rent.\n\nD. Require that the artist move out immediately or be held responsible for three years' rent.\n\nThis seems drastic. Holding the artist responsible for three years' rent would be equivalent to enforcing the original lease term, but I think that once the lease expires and the tenant stays with the landlord's consent (by accepting rent), the tenancy continues on different terms, perhaps month-to-month.\n\nI need to think more carefully about the concept of holdover tenancy.\n\nAt common law, when a lease expires but the tenant remains in possession and the landlord accepts rent, it's generally understood that a new tenancy is created, often a periodic tenancy, like month-to-month. In such a case, the landlord can't suddenly change the terms unless there's a new agreement, but they can evict the tenant with proper notice.\n\nHowever, before accepting that first rent payment after the lease expires, perhaps the retiree had different options.\n\nMaybe she could have chosen to terminate the tenancy and require the artist to move out immediately, without creating a new tenancy.\n\nBut if she accepted the rent, that would likely create a new tenancy, making it harder to evict the artist without proper notice.\n\nSo, perhaps the retiree could have served a notice to quit or not accept the rent to avoid creating a new tenancy.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the remedy available before accepting the first rental payment after the lease period ended.\n\nI'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to research this a bit more.\n\nUpon checking, at common law, when a lease expires but the tenant remains in possession and the landlord accepts rent, it's generally considered that a new tenancy is created, often on a periodic basis, such as month-to-month.\n\nHowever, if the landlord does not accept rent and instead demands that the tenant vacate the premises, the tenant may be considered a holdover tenant or a tenant at sufferance, and the landlord can seek to evict them without creating a new tenancy.\n\nSo, before accepting that first rent payment after the lease expires, the retiree could have chosen to demand that the artist vacate the premises immediately, without creating a new tenancy.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct answer is A: Eviction of the artist for non-payment of rent.\n\nBut wait, the artist was paying rent until they decided to move out. So, if the retiree didn't accept the rent and demanded they move out, it might be considered non-payment of rent, but it's more about the retiree's intention not to continue the tenancy.\n\nOption D says: Require that the artist move out immediately or be held responsible for three years' rent.\n\nThis seems too harsh. I don't think common law would support holding the artist responsible for three years' rent just because the retiree didn't accept the first rent payment after the lease expired.\n\nOption B talks about recovering the difference between the lease price and the fair market value for a year.\n\nThis might be relevant if the lease price was below market rate, and the retiree wanted to adjust the rent to reflect current market conditions. However, at common law, once a lease expires and the tenant stays with the landlord's consent (by accepting rent), the terms of the original lease continue unless there's an agreement to change them. So, the retiree couldn't unilaterally increase the rent to market value without a new agreement.\n\nOption C suggests recovering double the rent on a monthly basis for the period the artist was on the premises beyond the three-year period.\n\nI don't recall any common law principle that allows for double rent in this scenario. Double rent might be a statutory provision in some jurisdictions for holdover tenants, but generally, at common law, the landlord can only recover the rent that was agreed upon or, in some cases, the value of the use and occupation.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most accurate answer is A: Eviction of the artist for non-payment of rent.\n\nThe reasoning is that before accepting the first rent payment after the lease expired, the retiree could have chosen not to accept the rent and instead demanded that the artist vacate the premises, effectively treating the artist as a holdover tenant and seeking eviction for non-payment of rent.\n\nHowever, I have some doubts because the artist was paying rent until they decided to move out. It seems like they were current with their rent obligations up to that point.\n\nMaybe another way to look at it is that once the lease expires, the artist's obligation to pay rent continues as long as they occupy the premises, and if they stop paying rent, the retiree can evict them for non-payment.\n\nBut in this case, the artist was paying rent until they gave notice and moved out. So, if the retiree didn't accept that last rent payment and demanded they move out immediately, it could be considered non-payment of rent.\n\nI think option A is the closest answer, but I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose the retiree didn't want to continue the tenancy after the lease expired. She could have given proper notice before the lease ended, informing the artist that she wouldn't be renewing the lease. But in this scenario, it seems like the lease expired and the artist stayed on, and the retiree accepted rent, which typically creates a new tenancy.\n\nHowever, the question specifies \"before she accepted the first rental payment after the end of the initial three-year period.\" So, perhaps the retiree had the option to not accept that first rent payment and instead demand that the artist vacate the premises, effectively avoiding the creation of a new tenancy.\n\nIn that case, the retiree could evict the artist for non-payment of rent, as the artist was occupying the premises without a valid tenancy agreement.\n\nTherefore, option A seems to be the correct remedy available to the retiree before accepting that first rent payment after the lease expired.\n\nI think I'll go with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
