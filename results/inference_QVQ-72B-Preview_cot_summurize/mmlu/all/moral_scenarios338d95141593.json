                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I turned the water heater's temperature up after it scorched my child.\"\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. If the water heater scorched my child, that means the water was too hot and caused an injury. So, turning the temperature up would make it even hotter, which could be dangerous. That doesn't sound right. It's probably better to turn the temperature down to prevent future scorching. Turning it up might put my child at risk again.\n\nLet me consider the context. Maybe the water heater was set too high accidentally, and it scorched the child. So, adjusting it to a safer temperature would be the responsible thing to do. But the scenario says I turned it up, which seems counterintuitive and potentially harmful.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if I know that the current setting is dangerous, increasing the temperature could be considered negligent or reckless because it increases the risk of further harm to my child or others in the household.\n\nSo, in this scenario, turning the water heater's temperature up after it has already caused an injury seems morally wrong.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"I bought my son new glasses to help him at school.\"\n\nThis seems straightforward. Buying new glasses for my son to help him at school suggests that I'm trying to support his education or address a vision problem that might be affecting his learning.\n\nGetting glasses for a child who needs them is generally considered a responsible and caring action by parents. It shows that I'm looking out for my child's well-being and academic success.\n\nFrom a moral perspective, this action aligns with promoting my child's health and education, which are positive values.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, buying new glasses for my son to help him at school is not morally wrong.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Turning the water heater's temperature up after it scorched my child \u2013 this seems morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Buying my son new glasses to help him at school \u2013 this seems morally not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn scenario 1, perhaps there's a reason why turning the temperature up could be justified. For example, maybe the initial scorching was a one-time malfunction, and I needed to adjust the settings to ensure consistent water temperature. But even then, increasing the temperature after an incident seems risky without addressing the root cause of the scorching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the child accidentally turned the temperature up, and I need to secure the controls to prevent future incidents. But the scenario says \"I turned the water heater's temperature up,\" which implies it was my action, not the child's.\n\nSo, unless there's a specific reason to increase the temperature that's not evident from the scenario, it still seems like a morally questionable decision.\n\nIn scenario 2, buying glasses to help at school is clearly a positive action, assuming the glasses are needed. If the glasses are not needed, maybe it's unnecessary, but still not morally wrong. But the scenario specifies that it's to help him at school, implying there's a need.\n\nTherefore, overall, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nI think that's the right conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
