                    "text": "Let's see what this problem is all about. We have two objects, A and B. There's a net force F_A acting on object A, and a net force F_B acting on object B. We're told that the mass of object B is twice that of object A, and that the acceleration of object B is twice that of object A. We need to find the relationship between F_A and F_B.\n\nFirst, I should recall Newton's second law, which says that force is equal to mass times acceleration. So, F = m * a.\n\nFor object A:\n\nF_A = m_A * a_A\n\nFor object B:\n\nF_B = m_B * a_B\n\nWe're given that m_B = 2 * m_A and a_B = 2 * a_A.\n\nSo, m_B = 2 * m_A\n\nAnd a_B = 2 * a_A\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for F_B:\n\nF_B = (2 * m_A) * (2 * a_A) = 4 * m_A * a_A\n\nBut we know that F_A = m_A * a_A\n\nSo, F_B = 4 * F_A\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check.\n\nIf F_A = m_A * a_A, and F_B = m_B * a_B, and m_B = 2 * m_A and a_B = 2 * a_A, then F_B should be 2 times m_A times 2 times a_A, which is 4 times m_A * a_A, which is 4 * F_A.\n\nSo, F_B = 4 * F_A\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. F_B = 1/4 F_A\n\nB. F_B = 1/2 F_A\n\nC. F_B = 2F_A\n\nD. F_B = 4F_A\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. F_B = 4F_A\n\nBut wait a minute, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nIs there any other factor that could affect this relationship? For example, are there any external factors or other forces acting on the objects that aren't considered here? The problem states that these are net forces, so I don't think there are any other forces to consider.\n\nAlso, the masses are related by a factor of 2, and accelerations by a factor of 2. So, multiplying both mass and acceleration by 2 should result in the force being multiplied by 4, since 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I can plug in some numbers to verify.\n\nSuppose m_A = 1 kg, then m_B = 2 kg.\n\nIf a_A = 1 m/s\u00b2, then a_B = 2 m/s\u00b2.\n\nThen, F_A = 1 kg * 1 m/s\u00b2 = 1 N\n\nF_B = 2 kg * 2 m/s\u00b2 = 4 N\n\nIndeed, F_B = 4 * F_A.\n\nAlternatively, if m_A = 2 kg, then m_B = 4 kg.\n\nIf a_A = 3 m/s\u00b2, then a_B = 6 m/s\u00b2.\n\nThen, F_A = 2 kg * 3 m/s\u00b2 = 6 N\n\nF_B = 4 kg * 6 m/s\u00b2 = 24 N\n\nAgain, F_B = 4 * F_A.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the units to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nForce is in newtons, mass in kilograms, acceleration in meters per second squared.\n\nNo issues there.\n\nIs there any possibility that the relationship isn't straightforward? For example, if there were multiple forces acting on the objects, but no, we're told these are net forces.\n\nI think the answer is D. F_B = 4F_A\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
