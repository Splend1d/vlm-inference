                    "text": "So I have this economics question here. It says: \"If the price of one good (A) increases and the quantity demanded of another good (B) increases, the two goods are...\" and then there are four options: A. substitute goods, B. complement goods, C. inferior goods, D. normal goods.\n\nHmm, okay, let's break this down. I need to understand the relationship between the price of good A and the quantity demanded of good B. When the price of A goes up, and as a result, the quantity demanded of B goes up, what does that tell me about how these two goods relate to each other?\n\nFirst, I should recall some basic economic concepts. There's the law of demand, which says that as the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded of that good decreases, assuming all else is equal. But here, we're dealing with two different goods, A and B.\n\nI think this has to do with substitute and complement goods. Substitute goods are those that can be used in place of each other. For example, if the price of coffee goes up, people might buy more tea instead. So, in that case, coffee and tea are substitutes. Similarly, if the price of beef increases, people might buy more chicken.\n\nOn the other hand, complement goods are those that are used together. For example, cars and gasoline. If the price of cars increases, the demand for gasoline might decrease because fewer people are buying cars.\n\nSo, back to the question. If the price of A increases and the quantity demanded of B increases, that suggests that A and B are substitutes. Because when A becomes more expensive, people are opting for B instead.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose good A is smartphones, and good B is feature phones. If smartphones become more expensive, some people might decide to buy feature phones instead, leading to an increase in the quantity demanded of feature phones.\n\nAnother example could be good A being butter and good B being margarine. If the price of butter increases, people might switch to margarine.\n\nWait a minute, what about complement goods? If good A and good B are complements, and the price of A increases, I would expect the quantity demanded of B to decrease, not increase. So, in that case, if B is decreasing when A's price increases, that would indicate they are complements. But in the question, it says the quantity demanded of B increases when A's price increases, which points towards them being substitutes.\n\nLet me consider the definition again. Substitute goods have a positive cross-price elasticity of demand, meaning that when the price of one good increases, the demand for the other good also increases.\n\nComplement goods have a negative cross-price elasticity of demand, meaning that when the price of one good increases, the demand for the other good decreases.\n\nSo, based on this, the scenario described in the question aligns with substitute goods.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider inferior and normal goods.\n\nInferior goods are those where, as income increases, the demand for them decreases because consumers switch to higher-quality options. Normal goods are those where demand increases as income increases.\n\nHowever, the relationship described in the question is between the price of one good and the quantity demanded of another good, which is more related to substitution or complementarity rather than income effects.\n\nSo, I don't think inferior or normal goods apply here directly.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using indifference curves or something, but that might be overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the market for good B. If the price of A increases, and this leads to an increase in the quantity demanded of B, it suggests that A and B are substitutes.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think about it in terms of opportunity cost. If A becomes more expensive, the relative cost of B decreases, making B a more attractive option, thus increasing its quantity demanded.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, in conclusion, based on the economic principles of substitute goods and cross-price elasticity, the correct answer should be A. substitute goods.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the other options again:\n\nB. complement goods: As I thought earlier, if A and B are complements, an increase in A's price would lead to a decrease in B's quantity demanded, not an increase.\n\nC. inferior goods: This relates to income effects, where as income rises, demand for inferior goods falls. But here, we're dealing with a change in A's price affecting B's quantity demanded, not an income change affecting demand.\n\nD. normal goods: Similar to C, this relates to income effects, where demand increases with income. Again, not directly related to the scenario presented.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is A. substitute goods.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
