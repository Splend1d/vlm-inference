                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out whether the court is likely to grant the plumber's motion to set aside the default judgment. Let me try to understand what's going on step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a company based in State A that's suing a plumber from State B in a federal court in State A. The company claims that the plumber messed up installing some pipes and caused $250,000 worth of damage to their headquarters building. So, the company is alleging negligence on the plumber's part.\n\nThe plumber, in response, files a motion to dismiss the case, saying the court doesn't have personal jurisdiction over him because he's from State B. But the court denies that motion, meaning they decide they do have the power to hear the case against the plumber.\n\nAfter the motion to dismiss is denied, the plumber doesn't do anything else\u2014no answer, no further responses. So, the company, seeing that the plumber isn't responding, asks the clerk to enter a default against the plumber. The clerk does that sixty days after the court's order denying the motion to dismiss.\n\nNow, with the default entered, the company applies to the court for a default judgment, meaning they want the court to rule in their favor because the plumber hasn't defended himself. They notify the plumber three days before the hearing for the default judgment application.\n\nAt the hearing, it's just the company presenting evidence on the amount of damages, since the plumber isn't there. The court listens to this evidence and then enters a default judgment for the full $250,000 that the company claimed.\n\nTen days after that judgment is entered, the plumber files a motion to set aside the default judgment. So, the question is, is the court likely to grant that motion?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. No, because the court could fix the amount of damages even without hearing the plumber's evidence.\n\nB. No, because the plumber failed to plead or otherwise defend against the company's action.\n\nC. Yes, because the plumber was not given adequate notice of the hearing on the company's application for the entry of a default judgment.\n\nD. Yes, because the State A federal court lacked personal jurisdiction over the plumber as a State B citizen.\n\nAlright, let's analyze these one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: the court could fix the amount of damages without the plumber's evidence. That seems plausible because in a default judgment, the court can determine damages based on the evidence presented by the plaintiff, even if the defendant doesn't show up. So, the fact that the plumber didn't provide his side on damages doesn't necessarily mean the judgment should be set aside.\n\nOption B says no because the plumber failed to plead or otherwise defend against the company's action. Well, that's true; the plumber didn't respond after the motion to dismiss was denied. But does that mean the court shouldn't grant the motion to set aside the default judgment? Maybe not directly. The failure to defend is what led to the default in the first place.\n\nOption C suggests that the plumber didn't get adequate notice of the hearing for the default judgment application. That's an important point. In most legal systems, including federal courts in the U.S., a party must be given adequate notice of significant proceedings, like a hearing for a default judgment. If the plumber didn't receive proper notice, that could be a valid reason to set aside the default judgment.\n\nOption D claims that the State A federal court lacked personal jurisdiction over the plumber because he's a citizen of State B. But wait, earlier in the scenario, the plumber filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, and the court denied it. So, presumably, the court decided that it does have jurisdiction over the plumber. Unless there's some error in that decision, this doesn't seem like a strong basis for setting aside the default judgment.\n\nNow, between options A, B, and C, I need to see which one is most likely to lead the court to grant the motion to set aside the default judgment.\n\nOption A is about the court's ability to determine damages without the defendant's input, which is generally acceptable in default judgments. So, that doesn't seem like a strong reason to set aside the judgment.\n\nOption B points out that the plumber failed to defend, which is why the default was entered in the first place. Granting the motion to set aside the judgment would essentially be giving the plumber another chance to respond, despite his previous inaction. While possible, it's not necessarily a given that the court would do that, especially if the plumber's inaction was willful or without good cause.\n\nOption C raises the issue of inadequate notice of the default judgment hearing. This is a significant point because due process requires that parties receive adequate notice of legal proceedings against them. If the plumber didn't get proper notice of the default judgment hearing, that could be a valid ground for setting aside the judgment.\n\nGiven that, I need to consider whether the three-day notice was adequate in this situation. In federal court, the rules generally require reasonable notice of hearings, but the exact timing can vary based on the circumstances. Three days might be too short, especially if the plumber lives in another state (State B), which could make it difficult to prepare or appear on such short notice.\n\nAdditionally, since the plumber had previously participated in the case by filing a motion to dismiss, he should be considered an appearing party, and thus entitled to notice of subsequent proceedings. If the notice was insufficient, that could be a basis for setting aside the default judgment.\n\nOn the other hand, the court might consider that the plumber had already been engaged in the case and was aware of the proceedings, so perhaps a shorter notice period is acceptable. However, without specific rules or case law to refer to, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the plumber has a meritorious defense or good cause for not responding after the motion to dismiss was denied. If he can show that he had a valid reason for not responding or that he intended to respond but something prevented him from doing so, that might strengthen his case for setting aside the default judgment.\n\nBut in the scenario provided, there's no indication that the plumber offered any explanation for his failure to respond or for seeking to set aside the default judgment. He simply files the motion ten days after the judgment is entered.\n\nGiven that, the court might be less inclined to set aside the judgment unless there's a compelling reason, such as inadequate notice.\n\nBetween the options given, option C seems the most plausible reason for the court to grant the motion to set aside the default judgment, assuming that the three-day notice was indeed inadequate.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that perhaps the court found the notice to be adequate, or that the plumber doesn't have a strong argument on that point. In that case, options A and B would suggest that the court is unlikely to grant the motion, while option D suggests that personal jurisdiction was lacking, but that was already addressed and denied by the court earlier.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is that the court will grant the plumber's motion to set aside the default judgment because he was not given adequate notice of the hearing on the company's application for the entry of a default judgment.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
