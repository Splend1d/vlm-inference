One October, his beloved baseball team was playing in the playoffs and he wanted to place a large bet on his team. He told one of his employees that he wanted to bet $10,000 on his team to win the championship, but that he did not have the time to travel to the casino to place the bet. He then told his employee that he wanted the employee to travel to the casino and place the bet for him. The businessman and the employee agreed that the employee would travel to the casino, place a $10,000 bet for the businessman and then immediately return. In exchange, the employee would be paid $500. The parties reduced this agreement to writing. After the agreement was signed, the businessman handed the employee $10,000 and a round-trip airline ticket. The businessman then told the employee that he would be paid $500 after the employee returned. The employee arrived the next day and immediately went to the casino. There he noticed that the marquis in the parking lot was unlit and covered in a banner that read, \"Casino Temporarily Closed Due to Renovations. \" Unable to reach the businessman by telephone, the employee placed the bet at another gaming establishment located next door to the casino. The following morning, the employee flew back and gave the betting receipt to the businessman. When the businessman saw that the bet had been made at another gaming establishment, he angrily told the employee, \"I purposely directed you to wager that $10,000 at the casino. Since you failed to follow my instructions, the deal's off. \" As a result, the businessman refused to pay the employee the $500. If the employee initiates suit for breach of contract, the court will most likely determine that placing the $10,000 wager at the other gaming establishment, rather than at the casino, constituted a\n\nA. breach of contract.\nB. modification.\nC. constructive condition precedent that was substantially performed.\nD. discharge by impossibility.\n"

So, he hires an employee to go to a specific casino and place a $10,000 bet on his behalf. They agree that the employee will get $500 for doing this, and they even put it in writing. The businessman gives the employee $10,000 and a round-trip airline ticket, and they agree that the $500 will be paid after the employee returns.\n\nSo, the employee goes to the casino the next day, but when they get there, the casino is closed for renovations. The marquis is unlit and there's a banner saying it's temporarily closed. The employee tries to call the businessman but can't reach him. So, the employee decides to place the bet at another gaming establishment right next door to the casino. Then, the employee flies back and gives the betting receipt to the businessman.\n\nBut the businessman is upset because the bet was placed at another casino, not the one he specified. He tells the employee that since the instructions weren't followed, the deal is off, and he refuses to pay the $500.\n\nNow, the question is, if the employee sues for breach of contract, what will the court most likely determine? The options are:\n\nA. Breach of contract.\n\nB. Modification.\n\nC. Constructive condition precedent that was substantially performed.\n\nD. Discharge by impossibility.\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, there's a contract between the businessman and the employee. The employee was to go to a specific casino and place a $10,000 bet, and in return, get $500. They even have it in writing, which is good.\n\nThe employee goes to the casino but finds it's closed. They can't reach the businessman, so they decide to place the bet at another nearby gaming establishment. They come back and give the receipt to the businessman, but he refuses to pay because the bet wasn't placed at the specified casino.\n\nSo, the issue here is whether the employee fulfilled their part of the contract. The businessman wanted the bet placed at a specific casino, but it was placed at another place.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Breach of contract: This would mean that the employee didn't do what was agreed upon. The businessman specified that the bet should be placed at the casino, and the employee placed it at another gaming establishment. So, technically, the employee didn't follow the exact instructions.\n\nBut, the employee did place the bet as instructed, just at a different location because the specified casino was closed.\n\nB. Modification: This would imply that the terms of the contract were changed after it was formed. But in this case, there was no agreement to change the terms. The employee just placed the bet elsewhere without agreement from the businessman.\n\nC. Constructive condition precedent that was substantially performed: This sounds complicated. A condition precedent is something that must happen before a contract obligation arises. A constructive condition might be implied by the court. Substantial performance means that even if not everything was done exactly as specified, enough was done to warrant partial payment.\n\nIn this case, the employee did place the bet, which was the main task, but at a different location than specified.\n\nD. Discharge by impossibility: This refers to when performance of the contract becomes impossible due to some external factor. Here, the casino was closed, which made it impossible for the employee to place the bet there.\n\nBut, the employee found an alternative place to place the bet, so maybe it wasn't entirely impossible.\n\nSo, which one is most likely?\n\nThe businessman might argue that the employee breached the contract by not placing the bet at the specified casino.\n\nBut, the employee could argue that they substantially performed their\u4e49\u52a1 because they placed the bet as instructed, just at a different location due to unforeseen circumstances.\n\nAlso, since the casino was closed, it was impossible to place the bet there, but they found an alternative.\n\nMaybe the court would consider this as substantial performance or even discharge by impossibility.\n\nBut, I think the most likely is that the court would consider this a breach of contract.\n\nBecause the employee didn't follow the specific instruction to place the bet at the casino, even if it was closed.\n\nThe businessman specified a particular casino, and that was part of the contract.\n\nThe employee should have tried to find another way to place the bet at the specified casino, like waiting until it reopens, or checking if it was only temporarily closed.\n\nBut, since they couldn't reach the businessman, maybe they had to make a decision on the spot.\n\nStill, in contract law, if there's a specific instruction, and it's not followed, it's considered a breach.\n\nEven if the employee had good reasons, like the casino being closed, they still didn't follow the exact instructions.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. Breach of contract.\n\nBut, I'm a bit unsure because the employee did place the bet, which was the main objective, just at a different location.\n\nMaybe the court would consider this substantial performance and require the businessman to pay, perhaps with some deduction for not following the exact instructions.\n\nBut, based on the options given, I think A. Breach of contract is the most accurate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
