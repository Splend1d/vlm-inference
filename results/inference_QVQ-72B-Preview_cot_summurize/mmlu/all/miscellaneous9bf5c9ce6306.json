                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"What kind of animal is cartoon character Tennessee Tuxedo?\" And the options are A. cat, B. skunk, C. walrus, D. penguin. Hmm, I need to figure this out. I think I've heard of Tennessee Tuxedo before, but I can't quite remember what kind of animal he is.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what Tennessee Tuxedo looks like. I think he's a black-and-white animal, maybe resembling a penguin or a skunk because of the color pattern. But I'm not sure. Let me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A is a cat. I don't remember cats typically having black-and-white tuxedo-like fur patterns, but it's possible. Some cats do have that kind of coloring, so maybe it's a possibility.\n\nOption B is a skunk. Skunks are known for their black-and-white coloration, which is often compared to a tuxedo. So, this seems like a likely candidate. Maybe Tennessee Tuxedo is a skunk.\n\nOption C is a walrus. Walruses are large marine mammals with grayish skin and prominent tusks. I don't recall Tennessee Tuxedo having tusks or being particularly large, so this seems unlikely. Probably not a walrus.\n\nOption D is a penguin. Penguins are black-and-white birds, often associated with tuxedos because of their color pattern. This also seems like a plausible option.\n\nNow, I need to narrow it down between the skunk and the penguin. Let me think about any distinctive features I might remember about Tennessee Tuxedo. I think he was a small animal, probably around the size of a skunk or a penguin. He also seemed to wear a bow tie or something similar, which might suggest a more formal appearance, like a penguin in a tuxedo.\n\nWait a minute, I'm getting confused. I think there's another cartoon character that's a penguin named Tuxedo Sam, but I'm not sure if that's the same as Tennessee Tuxedo. Maybe I'm mixing them up.\n\nLet me try a different approach. I'll think about the context in which Tennessee Tuxedo appeared. I believe he was from an old cartoon show, maybe in the 1960s or 1970s. I think he had a catchphrase or something, but I can't remember what it was.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the name \"Tennessee Tuxedo.\" The name suggests he might be from Tennessee, and \"tuxedo\" refers to his black-and-white coloration. Both skunks and penguins have tuxedo-like markings, so that doesn't help much.\n\nMaybe I should consider the physical characteristics. Skunks have a more rounded back and a bushy tail, while penguins have flippers and a more upright posture. If I can recall, Tennessee Tuxedo seemed to stand upright, almost like a person, which might lean more towards a penguin.\n\nBut then again, some cartoon skunks are anthropomorphized and stand upright too. So that might not be a reliable indicator.\n\nPerhaps I should think about the setting of the cartoon. If it was set in Tennessee, where skunks are common, that might point towards skunk. However, penguins are typically found in colder climates, not in Tennessee. But since it's a cartoon, the setting might not necessarily dictate the type of animal.\n\nWait, maybe I can recall the shape of Tennessee Tuxedo. I think he was somewhat rounded, with
