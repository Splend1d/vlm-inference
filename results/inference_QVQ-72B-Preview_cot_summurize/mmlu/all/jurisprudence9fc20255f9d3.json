I'm not super familiar with critical legal theory, but from what I understand, it's a movement that challenges traditional views of law, suggesting that law isn't just a neutral set of rules but is instead shaped by social, political, and economic factors. So, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says, \"Law is politics.\" I think critical legal theorists would agree with this. They probably see law as an extension of political power and as a tool for maintaining social control. So, this doesn't seem like something they would reject.\n\nOption B says, \"Law is determinate.\" Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what determinate means in this context. Does it mean that law is clear, certain, and predictable? If so, I suspect that critical legal theorists might disagree with this. They might argue that law is indeterminate, meaning that it's open to interpretation and isn't always clear-cut. So, perhaps they would reject the idea that law is determinate.\n\nOption C says, \"Law reflects economic power.\" This sounds like something they would agree with. Critical legal theorists often emphasize how law serves the interests of those with economic power, reinforcing existing inequalities. So, this proposition seems aligns with their views.\n\nOption D says, \"Law is unstable.\" This could be interpreted in different ways. If it means that law is constantly changing and unpredictable, critical legal theorists might agree with that, given their view on indeterminacy. But if it suggests that the entire legal system is unstable and unreliable, they might not necessarily agree with that.\n\nGiven these thoughts, I'm leaning towards Option B, \"Law is determinate,\" as the proposition that critical legal theorists would reject. But I want to make sure I understand what determinate means in this context. Maybe I should look it up to be certain.\n\nAlright, I looked it up, and determinate in law generally means that legal rules are definite and predictable, allowing for consistent application. Critical legal theorists, on the other hand, argue that law is indeterminate, meaning that it's subject to interpretation and can lead to different outcomes based on the interpreter's perspective. So, yes, they would likely reject the idea that law is determinate.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the other options again:\n\n- Option A: Law is politics \u2013 They would agree.\n\n- Option C: Law reflects economic power \u2013 They would agree.\n\n- Option D: Law is unstable \u2013 Depending on the interpretation, they might agree with law being indeterminate, but unstable could be seen as too extreme.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward answer is Option B: Law is determinate, which critical legal theorists would reject.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
