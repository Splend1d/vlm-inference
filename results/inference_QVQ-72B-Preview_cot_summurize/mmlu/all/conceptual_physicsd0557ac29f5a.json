                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"When 100 J are put into a device that puts out 40 J of useful work, the efficiency of the device is...\" and then there are four options: A. 40%, B. 50%, C. 60%, D. 140%. Okay, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what efficiency means in this context. Efficiency is basically how much of the input energy is converted into useful output energy. So, it's like, how good is the device at turning what you put in into what you want out.\n\nI think the formula for efficiency is:\n\nEfficiency = (Useful Work Output / Total Energy Input) \u00d7 100%\n\nSo, in this case, the total energy input is 100 joules, and the useful work output is 40 joules. Plugging those into the formula:\n\nEfficiency = (40 J / 100 J) \u00d7 100%\n\nLet me calculate that. 40 divided by 100 is 0.4. Then, multiplying by 100% gives 40%. So, that would be option A. 40%.\n\nWait a minute, is there more to this? Maybe I should think about whether there's any other factor that could affect the efficiency. Like, maybe there's heat loss or something, but the problem doesn't mention that. Or maybe the device uses some stored energy, but again, no information about that.\n\nAlright, based on the information given, it seems straightforward. Input is 100 J, output is 40 J, so efficiency is 40%. Let me see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the definition again. Efficiency is indeed the ratio of output to input, expressed as a percentage. So, yes, that's consistent with what I did.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the units to make sure. Joules are units of energy, and efficiency is a unitless percentage, so that checks out.\n\nIs there any possibility of misinterpretation here? For example, could the 40 J be something else besides useful work? The problem specifically says \"useful work,\" so I think it's safe to assume that's what it is.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the angles here. The answer should be A. 40%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 40\\%} \\]"
