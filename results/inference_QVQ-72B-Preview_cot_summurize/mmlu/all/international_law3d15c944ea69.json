                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what exactly a treaty is according to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT). There are a few options here, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me go through each option carefully.\n\nOption A says that treaties are all agreements concluded between States, international organizations, and non-State entities, like corporations. Hmm, I thought treaties were primarily between states, but I recall that sometimes international organizations can be parties to treaties too. But non-State entities like corporations? I'm not so sure about that. Maybe they can be involved in some international agreements, but I don't think they're considered parties to treaties in the same way states are. So, maybe this isn't entirely accurate.\n\nOption B states that treaties are agreements concluded between States in written form and governed by international law. This sounds familiar. I remember learning that treaties are essentially contracts between countries, and they're supposed to be in writing. Also, they're governed by international law, which makes sense because they involve relations between sovereign states. But wait, can treaties only be in written form? What about oral agreements between states? Are those considered treaties? I need to check that.\n\nOption C mentions that treaties are both written and oral agreements between States. This seems to suggest that treaties can be either written or spoken. But I thought that generally, international treaties are supposed to be in writing to ensure clarity and to have a formal record. I don't recall oral agreements being considered proper treaties. Maybe in some exceptional cases, but generally, I think they need to be in writing. I should verify this.\n\nOption D says that treaties are agreements concluded between States in written form governed either by international or domestic law. This is interesting. I know that treaties are primarily governed by international law, but sometimes, domestic law can influence how treaties are implemented within a country. However, I don't think that treaties are governed by domestic law in the same way they are by international law. Treaties are international agreements, so their primary governing framework should be international law. Including domestic law here might be too broad.\n\nLet me see if I can recall the exact definition from the VCLT. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties defines a treaty as \"an international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law.\" That sounds a lot like option B. It specifies that treaties are between states, in written form, and governed by international law. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if international organizations can be parties to treaties. I think they can, under certain circumstances. For example, the European Union signs treaties with other states or international organizations. So, perhaps the definition should include international organizations as potential parties to treaties.\n\nHowever, going back to option A, it includes non-State entities like corporations. I'm pretty sure that corporations aren't direct parties to treaties. While they might be subject to international law in some contexts, like international human rights or international criminal law, I don't think they can enter into treaties with states on an equal footing. Maybe there are exceptions, but generally, I don't think so.\n\nOption C suggests that oral agreements can be treaties. I recall that in international law, there's a preference for written agreements to ensure clarity and to have a formal record. Oral agreements might not be as binding or recognized in the same way as written treaties. So, probably, this isn't accurate.\n\nOption D includes domestic law in the governance of treaties, which seems off. Treaties are international agreements, and while their implementation might involve domestic law, the treaty itself is governed by international law. So, including domestic law here might be misleading.\n\nTherefore, based on my understanding, option B seems to be the most accurate definition of a treaty according to the VCLT. It's specifically between states, in written form, and governed by international law.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll look up the actual definition from the VCLT. Article 2(1)(a) of the VCLT defines a treaty as \"an international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law, whether embodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments and whatever its particular designation.\" Yep, that matches option B perfectly.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option B: treaties are agreements concluded between States in written form and governed by international law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
