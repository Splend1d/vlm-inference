                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these statements about goal-setting theory is incorrect. I remember that goal-setting theory is all about how goals affect motivation and performance. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that goals serve two purposes: they are a basis for motivation and they direct behaviors. That sounds right to me. Goals give us something to aim for, which motivates us, and they also guide our actions towards achieving those goals. So, I don't think A is incorrect.\n\nOption B says that goal attainment is maximized when goals are specific and highly difficult. Hmm, I need to be careful here. I know that setting specific goals is important because it gives clear direction and helps focus efforts. But what about highly difficult goals? Well, challenging goals can be motivating, but if they're too difficult, they might become demotivating. Maybe there's a point where goals are so hard that they're seen as unachievable, which could lead to decreased motivation rather than increased attainment. So, perhaps this statement is a bit too absolute. Maybe goal attainment isn't always maximized with highly difficult goals.\n\nOption C says that goal attainment is maximized when frequent feedback is given. Feedback is important in goal-setting because it helps people know how they're progressing towards their goals. Frequent feedback can allow for adjustments and corrections along the way, which should help in achieving the goals more effectively. So, this seems correct to me.\n\nOption D says that worker participation in goal-setting is also good. Participative goal-setting involves employees in the process of setting their own goals. This can lead to higher commitment to the goals because people are more invested in something they've helped create. It can also lead to more realistic goals since employees have firsthand knowledge of what's achievable. So, this seems like a positive thing.\n\nBased on my thinking, option B seems to be the one that might be incorrect. While specific goals are important, highly difficult goals might not always lead to maximized attainment. In fact, if goals are too difficult, they might have the opposite effect, leading to decreased motivation and lower attainment.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I recall that in goal-setting theory, there is a concept that harder goals lead to better performance, but only up to a point. Beyond that point, goals that are too difficult can lead to decreased performance because they may cause anxiety, lead to risk-averse behavior, or make people give up if they feel the goals are unattainable.\n\nSo, yes, it seems that while challenging goals can be motivating, there's a limit to how difficult they can be before they start having a negative impact on performance. Therefore, stating that goal attainment is maximized when goals are highly difficult is incorrect, because there's a balance needed between difficulty and achievability.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it. So, the incorrect statement is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
