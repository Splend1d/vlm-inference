                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about auditing. It says that when the operating effectiveness of a control isn't evidenced by written documentation, an auditor should obtain evidence about the control's effectiveness by which of the following methods: mailing confirmations, inquiry and other procedures like observation, analytical procedures, or recalculating the balance in related accounts.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"operating effectiveness of a control\" means. I think it refers to how well a company's internal controls are working in practice. So, if there's no written documentation to prove that these controls are being followed, the auditor has to find other ways to confirm that the controls are actually effective.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Mailing confirmations: This seems like a way to verify account balances with third parties, like sending a confirmation request to a bank or another company to confirm the balance of an account. But does this directly relate to the operating effectiveness of a control? Maybe not directly. It's more about verifying specific account balances rather than testing how controls are operating.\n\nB. Inquiry and other procedures such as observation: This sounds promising. Inquiry means asking company personnel about how controls are being applied. Observation would involve the auditor watching the processes in action to see if the controls are being followed as intended. This could be a good way to assess the effectiveness of controls without relying on written documentation.\n\nC. Analytical procedures: These involve reviewing financial data for relationships and trends that might indicate issues. For example, comparing current period figures to prior periods or to industry averages. While analytical procedures can help identify potential problems, I'm not sure if they directly assess the operating effectiveness of specific controls.\n\nD. Recalculating the balance in related accounts: This seems similar to confirmation but focuses on verifying the mathematical accuracy of account balances. It might help confirm the accuracy of amounts but doesn't necessarily speak to whether controls are operating effectively.\n\nSo, considering these options, I think B. Inquiry and other procedures such as observation is the most appropriate choice. It allows the auditor to directly assess how controls are being applied in practice, even without written documentation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if any of the other options could also be relevant.\n\nFor example, A. Mailing confirmations: While confirmations can provide evidence about account balances, they don't directly test the effectiveness of the controls that are supposed to prevent errors or fraud in the first place.\n\nC. Analytical procedures: These can be useful for gaining an understanding of the business and identifying areas of higher risk, but they don't directly evaluate the operating effectiveness of specific controls.\n\nD. Recalculating the balance in related accounts: This is more of a substantive procedure to verify the accuracy of account balances, rather than a test of controls.\n\nTherefore, I still believe that B. Inquiry and other procedures such as observation is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about the auditor's approach in more detail. Auditors use a variety of procedures to test controls, and when there's no written documentation, they might have to rely more on direct observation and inquiries.\n\nAlso, perhaps they could use some form of testing of controls through substantive testing of transactions. For example, selecting a sample of transactions and checking if the controls were applied correctly.\n\nHowever, without written documentation, it might be challenging to perform such tests reliably. That makes inquiry and observation even more crucial.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes, auditors might use IT\u5ba1\u8ba1 techniques to test controls, especially in cases where controls are embedded in software systems. But again, this would require some form of documentation or evidence that the controls are operating effectively.\n\nI think I'm reinforcing my initial thought that inquiry and observation are key here.\n\nLet me check a standard auditing textbook or resource to confirm this.\n\nAccording to the Auditing Standards, when written documentation of controls is lacking, auditors should consider other forms of evidence. The Standards suggest that auditors can obtain evidence about the design and operating effectiveness of controls through inquiry, observation, inspection, and reperformance.\n\nSo, this aligns with option B, which mentions inquiry and observation.\n\nAdditionally, the Standards indicate that when documentation is insufficient or unavailable, auditors may need to perform more extensive substantive procedures or alternative audit procedures to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence.\n\nTherefore, while analytical procedures and confirmations might be part of the auditor's toolkit, they are not directly addressing the operating effectiveness of controls in the absence of written documentation.\n\nIn conclusion, based on my understanding and the auditing standards, the correct answer is B. Inquiry and other procedures such as observation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
