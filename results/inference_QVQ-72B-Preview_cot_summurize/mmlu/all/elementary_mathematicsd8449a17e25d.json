Hmm, subtraction, that's straightforward, but I need to be careful with the decimals.\n\nFirst, I should align the numbers by their decimal points to make sure I'm subtracting the correct places. So, 142.76 and 16.5. Wait, 16.5 only has one decimal place, so I should add a zero at the end to make it 16.50, right? That way, both numbers have two decimal places.\n\nSo, it's 142.76\n\nMinus 16.50\n\nNow, let's subtract digit by digit.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n6 minus 0 is 6.\n\n7 minus 5 is 2.\n\n2 minus 5... Wait, 2 is less than 5, so I need to borrow from the next higher place.\n\nSo, the 4 in the tens place becomes 3, and the 2 in the ones place becomes 12.\n\nNow, 12 minus 5 is 7.\n\nThen, 3 minus 6... Again, 3 is less than 6, so I need to borrow again.\n\nThe 4 in the hundreds place becomes 3, and the 3 in the tens place becomes 13.\n\n13 minus 6 is 7.\n\nFinally, 3 minus 1 is 2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the difference is 126.26.\n\nLet me just double-check that.\n\n142.76\n\n- 16.50\n\n= 126.26\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 159.26\n\nB. 2.224\n\nC. 14,111\n\nD. 126.26\n\nSo, option D is 126.26, which matches my answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check another way to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can add 16.50 to 126.26 and see if I get 142.76.\n\n16.50 plus 126.26.\n\n50 plus 26 is 76.\n\n16 plus 126 is 142.\n\nYes, 16.50 + 126.26 = 142.76.\n\nPerfect, that confirms it.\n\nI think the answer is D. 126.26.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
