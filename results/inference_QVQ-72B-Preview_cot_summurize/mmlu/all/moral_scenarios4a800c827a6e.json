                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. In Scenario 1, the person says, \"I put my son in online classes because I didn't want teachers to see my son's bruises.\" So, there's a child with bruises, and the parent is choosing online classes to hide those bruises from teachers. That sounds concerning. Bruises on a child can be indicative of abuse or neglect, and teachers are often mandatory reporters who are required to report any suspected child abuse. So, by avoiding in-person classes, the parent might be trying to prevent teachers from seeing the bruises and possibly reporting them.\n\nNow, in Scenario 2, the person says, \"I moved to the United States to become a resident.\" This seems straightforward. Someone has relocated to the US with the intention of becoming a resident. Assuming that they've followed the proper legal procedures and obtained the necessary visas or green card, this action doesn't appear to be morally wrong. People move to different countries for various reasons, such as better job opportunities, family reunification, or seeking a different lifestyle, and that's generally accepted.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking about ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. So, I need to consider the context of that time. In 2020, the US was facing challenges related to immigration, but assuming that the person moved legally and followed all the rules, there shouldn't be any moral issue with that decision.\n\nBack to Scenario 1, the issue seems more complex. Hiding bruises from teachers could be seen as an attempt to cover up potential abuse. If the bruises are a result of accidental injury, perhaps the parent is embarrassed or worried about unnecessary intervention. However, if the bruises are a result of abuse, the parent's action could be seen as complicit in hiding the abuse, which is morally reprehensible.\n\nBut I don't have enough information to determine the cause of the bruises. Maybe the parent is aware of the source of the bruises and is trying to protect the child in their own way, or perhaps the bruises are from a harmless accident, and the parent is overreacting. Without more context, it's hard to make a definitive judgment.\n\nHowever, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, if a parent is knowingly hiding signs of potential abuse, that would be considered wrong. On the other hand, if the bruises are from innocent causes, and the parent is just trying to avoid unnecessary attention, it might still be seen as protective but perhaps not necessarily morally wrong.\n\nBut, in general, transparency is important when it comes to children's well-being, especially regarding injuries that could indicate abuse. Teachers and other school staff are trained to look for signs of potential harm to children, and parents are expected to cooperate with them in ensuring the child's safety.\n\nSo, in Scenario 1, the action of putting the son in online classes to hide bruises from teachers could be seen as interfering with the school's ability to monitor the child's well-being, which could be considered morally wrong.\n\nIn contrast, Scenario 2 seems\u65e0\u8f9c. Moving to another country for residency, assuming it's done legally and ethically, shouldn't be considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 appears to involve doing something morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does not.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" which corresponds to option B.\n\nWait a minute, the options are labeled as A, B, C, D, with descriptions. Let me double-check:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nYes, my conclusion matches option B.\n\nI think that's the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
