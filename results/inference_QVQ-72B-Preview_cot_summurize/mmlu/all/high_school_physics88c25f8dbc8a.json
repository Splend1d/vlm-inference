                    "text": "So I have this problem about a capacitor. It says that the plates of a capacitor are charged to a potential difference of 5 volts, and the capacitance is 2 millifarads. I need to find the charge on the positive plate. The options are A. 0.005 C, B. 0.01 C, C. 0.02 C, and D. 0.5 C.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a capacitor is and how it works. A capacitor consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulator, and when a voltage is applied across these plates, they store electric charge. The relationship between the charge (Q), the capacitance (C), and the voltage (V) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ Q = C \\times V \\]\n\nSo, if I know the capacitance and the voltage, I can find the charge by multiplying them together.\n\nGiven that, the capacitance is 2 millifarads. I should make sure I'm using the correct units. Farads are the unit for capacitance, and millifarads are one-thousandth of a farad. So, 2 millifarads is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\, \\text{mF} = 2 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{F} \\]\n\nAnd the potential difference is 5 volts.\n\nNow, plugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ Q = (2 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{F}) \\times 5 \\, \\text{V} \\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\[ Q = 2 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 5 \\]\n\n\\[ Q = 10 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{C} \\]\n\n\\[ Q = 10 \\, \\text{milliCoulombs} \\]\n\nBut the options are given in Coulombs, so I need to convert milliCoulombs to Coulombs.\n\n\\[ 10 \\, \\text{mC} = 10 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{C} = 0.01 \\, \\text{C} \\]\n\nSo, the charge on the positive plate should be 0.01 Coulombs, which corresponds to option B.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the formula:\n\n\\[ Q = C \\times V \\]\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\[ Q = 2 \\, \\text{mF} \\times 5 \\, \\text{V} \\]\n\n\\[ Q = 2 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{F} \\times 5 \\, \\text{V} \\]\n\n\\[ Q = 10 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{C} \\]\n\n\\[ Q = 0.01 \\, \\text{C} \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the units to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nCapacitance is defined as charge per voltage:\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{Q}{V} \\]\n\nSo, rearranging for Q:\n\n\\[ Q = C \\times V \\]\n\nWhich is what I used.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here; it seems like a straightforward calculation.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this, maybe to verify the answer.\n\nIf the capacitor has a capacitance of 2 mF and the voltage across it is 5 V, then the charge stored should indeed be:\n\n\\[ Q = C \\times V = 2 \\, \\text{mF} \\times 5 \\, \\text{V} = 10 \\, \\text{mC} = 0.01 \\, \\text{C} \\]\n\nAnother way to think about it is that for a parallel plate capacitor, the charge is directly proportional to the voltage applied, given the capacitance.\n\nI don't see any reason to doubt this calculation. The answer should be 0.01 Coulombs, which is option B.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption A is 0.005 C, which would correspond to half of 0.01 C. Maybe if I mistakenly used a different value for capacitance, but in this case, I used 2 mF correctly.\n\nOption C is 0.02 C, which would be double of 0.01 C. That might happen if I incorrectly used 4 mF for capacitance, but that's not the case here.\n\nOption D is 0.5 C, which seems too large compared to the calculation. That would require a capacitance of 0.1 F if voltage is 5 V, which is not the case.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: 0.01 C.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any errors in the reasoning or the calculation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
