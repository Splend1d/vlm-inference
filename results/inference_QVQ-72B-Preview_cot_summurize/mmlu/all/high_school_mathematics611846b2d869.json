                    "text": "Let's see. I have this function f(x) = 4 - 5x, and I need to find its inverse. The options are a bit confusing, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, to find the inverse of a function, I think I should swap the x and y variables and then solve for y. So, starting with y = 4 - 5x, I'll swap x and y:\n\nx = 4 - 5y\n\nNow, I need to solve this equation for y. Let's see:\n\nx = 4 - 5y\n\nI can subtract 4 from both sides:\n\nx - 4 = -5y\n\nThen, divide both sides by -5:\n\n(y) = (x - 4)/(-5)\n\nSimplifying that, it's:\n\ny = -(x - 4)/5\n\nHmm, looking at the options, there's one that says y = (x - 4)/5, which is option b. But mine has a negative sign in front of the denominator. Wait, maybe I can rewrite it.\n\nLet's see, -(x - 4) is the same as (4 - x). So, y = (4 - x)/5. Is that any of the options?\n\nLooking at option a: 5/(x - 4), that's not the same.\n\nOption b: (x - 4)/5, which is similar to what I have, but without the negative sign.\n\nOption c: (x + 4)/5, that's different.\n\nOption d: -(x - 4)/5, which is the same as what I got.\n\nSo, it seems like option d is the correct answer, since that's exactly what I got.\n\nWait a minute, but option b looks similar to what I have, but without the negative sign. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check my steps.\n\nI started with y = 4 - 5x.\n\nSwapped x and y:\n\nx = 4 - 5y\n\nThen, solved for y:\n\nx - 4 = -5y\n\nThen, y = (x - 4)/(-5)\n\nWhich simplifies to y = -(x - 4)/5\n\nThat should be correct. So, option d is the correct answer.\n\nBut option b is (x - 4)/5, which is different from what I have. The negative sign matters, right? Because if I plug in a value, say x = 1, into both expressions, I should get different results.\n\nLet me test that.\n\nFirst, using option b: (1 - 4)/5 = (-3)/5 = -0.6\n\nUsing option d: -(1 - 4)/5 = -( -3)/5 = 3/5 = 0.6\n\nBut according to the original function, f(1) = 4 - 5(1) = -1\n\nSo, the inverse should satisfy that if y = -1, then x = 1.\n\nSo, plugging y = -1 into the inverse:\n\nOption b: ( -1 - 4)/5 = (-5)/5 = -1, which should correspond to x = -1, but f(-1) = 4 - 5(-1) = 9, not -1.\n\nOption d: -(-1 - 4)/5 = -( -5)/5 = 5/5 = 1, which matches x = 1.\n\nSo, option d gives the correct corresponding x value for y = -1.\n\nTherefore, the correct inverse is y = -(x - 4)/5, which is option d.\n\nI think I was getting confused between the different forms, but this makes sense now.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
