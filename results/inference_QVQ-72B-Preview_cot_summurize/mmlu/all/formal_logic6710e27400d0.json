                    "text": "Alright, I've got this problem here: \"Some students work hard.\" And I need to translate this into predicate logic from the given options. The options are:\n\nA. (\u2203x)(Wx \u2228 Sx)\n\nB. (\u2203x)(Sx \u2228 Wx)\n\nC. (\u2203x)(Sx \u2022 Wx)\n\nD. (\u2203x)(Sx \u2283 Wx)\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each symbol represents. I assume that:\n\n- Sx means \"x is a student\"\n\n- Wx means \"x works hard\"\n\nThe phrase \"some students work hard\" means that there is at least one person who is both a student and works hard. So, in logical terms, it should be saying that there exists an x such that x is a student and x works hard.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: (\u2203x)(Wx \u2228 Sx)\n\nThis means \"there exists an x that is either a worker or a student.\" But wait, the original statement is about students who work hard, not just being a worker or a student. This doesn't seem to match.\n\nOption B: (\u2203x)(Sx \u2228 Wx)\n\nThis is similar to option A; it says \"there exists an x that is either a student or works hard.\" Again, this doesn't capture the idea that some students work hard. It could include people who are not students but work hard, which isn't what the original statement is saying.\n\nOption C: (\u2203x)(Sx \u2022 Wx)\n\nThis means \"there exists an x that is a student and works hard.\" This seems to directly match the meaning of \"some students work hard.\" It specifies that there is at least one entity that is both a student and works hard.\n\nOption D: (\u2203x)(Sx \u2283 Wx)\n\nThis one is a bit trickier. It says \"there exists an x such that if x is a student, then x works hard.\" This is equivalent to saying that all students among the entities we're considering work hard. However, the original statement is about some students, not all. So, this might not be the best fit.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think differently about option D. It says that there exists at least one x for which the implication \"if x is a student, then x works hard\" holds. But in logic, the implication p \u2283 q is true unless p is true and q is false. So, (\u2203x)(Sx \u2283 Wx) means there is at least one x where either x is not a student or x works hard, or both. This could include entities that are not students, or students who work hard. But it doesn't guarantee that there is any student who works hard, because it allows for the possibility that x is not a student.\n\nOn the other hand, option C clearly states that there is at least one x that is both a student and works hard.\n\nSo, between the options, C seems to be the most accurate translation of \"some students work hard.\"\n\nLet me double-check. Suppose I have a domain where there are students and non-students, and some people work hard and some don't.\n\n- Option A: There could be non-students who work hard, which doesn't necessarily mean some students work hard.\n\n- Option B: Same issue; it allows for non-students who work hard.\n\n- Option D: As I thought earlier, it could be satisfied by entities that are not students, so it doesn't guarantee that some students work hard.\n\n- Option C: This directly states that there is at least one entity that is both a student and works hard, which matches the original statement perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the best translation into predicate logic for \"some students work hard\" is option C: (\u2203x)(Sx \u2022 Wx).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
