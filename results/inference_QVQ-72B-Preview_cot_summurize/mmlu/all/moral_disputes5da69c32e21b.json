                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Kass's worries regarding cloned individuals. The options are:\n\nA. will be seen as curiosities.\n\nB. will be scrutinized in relation to the person they are clones of.\n\nC. both of the above\n\nD. none of the above\n\nI need to figure out which of these concerns Kass has about cloning.\n\nFirst, I should probably know who Kass is. I think Leon Kass is an American public intellectual and ethicist who has written about various ethical issues, including cloning. He's known for his critiques of reproductive technologies and cloning in particular.\n\nSo, if I recall correctly, Kass is against cloning humans because he believes it would undermine the uniqueness and dignity of individuals. He thinks that cloning is a form of playing God and that it could lead to ethical dilemmas.\n\nNow, looking at option A: will be seen as curiosities. I can see how that might be a concern. If someone is cloned, they might be treated differently because they're a copy of someone else. People might look at them as oddities or something to stare at, which could be upsetting for the cloned individual.\n\nOption B: will be scrutinized in relation to the person they are clones of. This also seems plausible. If someone is cloned, people might constantly compare them to the original person. They might be expected to behave or think a certain way because they're a clone, which could put a lot of pressure on them.\n\nSo both A and B seem like possible concerns that Kass might have.\n\nBut the question is asking specifically about Kass's worries. Maybe he only worries about one of these things.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully.\n\nI remember that Kass has written about the moral status of clones and how they might be perceived in society. He likely worries that clones would face a lot of ethical and social challenges.\n\nOne of his main concerns is that clones would lack uniqueness since they are genetically identical to another person. This could lead to them being viewed as less than fully individual, which aligns with being seen as a curiosity or being constantly compared to the original person.\n\nAdditionally, Kass might worry about the expectations placed on clones to live up to the legacy or achievements of the person they were cloned from. This could lead to intense scrutiny and pressure, which relates to option B.\n\nGiven that, it seems like both A and B are valid concerns for Kass.\n\nBut maybe there's a difference between being seen as a curiosity and being scrutinized in relation to the original person.\n\nBeing seen as a curiosity might just mean that people are interested in looking at or learning about the clone because they find the concept of cloning fascinating or unusual.\n\nOn the other hand, being scrutinized in relation to the original person implies that people are not only interested in the clone but are also making comparisons and perhaps judging the clone based on the traits or accomplishments of the original.\n\nSo, perhaps being seen as a curiosity is more about the novelty of cloning, while being scrutinized is about the expectations and comparisons to the original.\n\nBoth of these could be worries for Kass, as they both pose challenges to the cloned individual's identity and well-being.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be C: both of the above.\n\nBut to make sure, maybe I should check some of Kass's writings or statements on cloning.\n\nI recall that in his essay \"The Wisdom of Repugnance,\" Kass argues against cloning on the basis that it would lead to a loss of uniqueness and individuality. He suggests that clones would be treated as mere copies rather than as distinct persons.\n\nThis seems to align with the idea that they would be seen as curiosities and scrutinized in relation to the original person.\n\nMoreover, in his book \"Life, Liberty, and the Defense of Dignity,\" Kass discusses the ethical implications of cloning and expresses concern about the psychological impact on clones who are constantly compared to their genetic predecessors.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that both A and B are concerns that Kass has about cloned individuals.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: both of the above.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
