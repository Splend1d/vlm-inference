Individualism. I need to recall what Fayol's principles are and see which one doesn't fit in.\n\nFirst, I should remember who Fayol is. He's Henri Fayol, a management theorist who developed these principles in the early 20th century. His 14 principles are classics in management theory, focusing on how to organize and manage work efficiently.\n\nLet me list out the 14 principles to the best of my recollection:\n\n1. Division of Work: Specialization increases efficiency.\n\n2. Authority and Responsibility: Authority comes with responsibility.\n\n3. Discipline: Employees should follow rules and regulations.\n\n4. Unity of Command: Each employee should report to only one manager.\n\n5. Unity of Direction: Similar activities should be directed by one plan.\n\n6. Subordination of Individual Interests to General Interests: Organizational goals come first.\n\n7. Remuneration: Fair pay for work performed.\n\n8. Centralization: Balance of decision-making power.\n\n9. Scalar Chain: The hierarchy of authority from top to bottom.\n\n10. Order: Everything and everyone in their proper place.\n\n11. Equity: Fair and kind treatment of employees.\n\n12. Stability of Tenure of Personnel: Avoid frequent changes in staff.\n\n13. Initiative: Encourage employees to take initiative.\n\n14. Esprit de Corps: Foster team spirit and harmony.\n\nOkay, so looking at this list, I see that Esprit de corps, Initiative, and Order are all on the list. Individualism isn't listed here. Instead, there's Unity of Command, Unity of Direction, Subordination of Individual Interests, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check. I found a list of 14 principles, and Individualism isn't among them. Esprit de corps is the spirit of teamwork, which is definitely one of his principles. Initiative is encouraged among employees, and Order refers to having everything in its place, which is also on the list.\n\nIndividualism seems out of place here. Fayol's principles emphasize coordination and unity, not individualism per se. While individual contributions are important, the principles are more about aligning individual efforts towards common goals.\n\nMoreover, in the context of management principles, Individualism might contradict some of Fayol's ideas like Unity of Command and Subordination of Individual Interests to General Interests. So, it makes sense that Individualism isn't one of his principles.\n\nI think the answer is D. Individualism.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if Individualism could be interpreted differently. Maybe it's about fostering individual creativity or something? But no, Fayol's principles are more about structure and coordination, not specifically about individualism.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that Individualism is not one of Fayol's 14 principles of management.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
