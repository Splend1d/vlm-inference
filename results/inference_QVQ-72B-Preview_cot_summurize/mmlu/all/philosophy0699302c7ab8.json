                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about John Stuart Mill and utilitarianism. The question says that Mill claims one of the strongest objections to utilitarianism is drawn from the idea of... and then gives four options: duty, justice, virtue, or supererogation. I need to pick which one Mill thought was the strongest objection.\n\nFirst off, I should probably recall what utilitarianism is. Utilitarianism is a moral theory that suggests the best action is the one that maximizes utility, usually defined as happiness or pleasure, for the greatest number of people. So, it's all about outcomes and overall well-being.\n\nNow, the question is about objections to utilitarianism, specifically the strongest one according to Mill. I remember that Mill himself was aware of criticisms of utilitarianism and addressed some of them in his book \"Utilitarianism.\"\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Duty: In Kantian ethics, duty is central, and it's often posed against utilitarianism. Kant thought that duties are based on categorical imperatives and are absolute, regardless of the consequences. Utilitarianism, on the other hand, is consequentialist and focuses on the outcomes. So, there's a conflict there. Maybe that's a strong objection.\n\nB. Justice: Utilitarianism sometimes faces the criticism that it could lead to unjust outcomes if the happiness of the majority requires sacrificing the happiness or rights of the minority. For example, punishing an innocent person if it keeps the peace. So, justice seems like a significant objection to utilitarianism.\n\nC. Virtue: Virtue ethics focuses on character and virtues like honesty, courage, and compassion. It's less concerned with the consequences of actions and more with the moral character of the person performing the action. Utilitarianism might overlook the importance of virtues if an action that lacks virtue still produces the best overall results. So, this could be another objection.\n\nD. Supererogation: This is a bit trickier. Supererogatory actions are those that go above and beyond what is morally required. In utilitarianism, all actions are evaluated based on their utility, and there might not be a concept of actions that are above and beyond duty. So, maybe utilitarianism has trouble accounting for supererogatory actions.\n\nNow, I need to recall what Mill specifically thought was the strongest objection. I remember that in \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill discusses several objections, including those related to justice and the \"higher\" and \"lower\" pleasures.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about how Mill responds to these objections. If I can recall, in Chapter V of \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill addresses various criticisms, including the idea that utilitarianism is a doctrine fit only for beasts, ignoring higher faculties, and so on.\n\nBut specifically, regarding the options given, I think Mill did discuss the objection concerning justice at length. He even formulates a version of the utility principle that incorporates justice, suggesting that justice is essentially about equal consideration for all and that violating justice would decrease overall utility.\n\nSimilarly, with duty, Mill might have addressed how utilitarianism can account for duties as rules that, when followed, lead to greater overall happiness.\n\nAs for virtue, Mill does discuss the importance of developing good moral characters and habits, which aligns with virtue ethics to some extent. He suggests that cultivating virtues is part of what leads to human flourishing and happiness.\n\nSupererogation might be a bit more complex. Mill might not have directly addressed supererogation in the same way that later ethicists did, but his theory does allow for actions that are not strictly required but still add to overall utility.\n\nWait, but the question is about what Mill considered the strongest objection, not necessarily how he responded to it.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I should look back at the question: \"Mill claims that one of the strongest objections to utilitarianism is drawn from the idea of...\"\n\nIt's phrased as though Mill is acknowledging an objection to his own view. Mill was known for being fair-minded and addressing criticisms of utilitarianism.\n\nIn \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill does spend a lot of time defending the principle of utility against various objections. One of the most prominent objections he addresses is the idea that utilitarianism is too demanding or that it doesn't account for certain moral intuitions, like the importance of justice.\n\nIn fact, in Chapter V, Mill discusses the objection that utilitarianism conflicts with our sense of justice. He writes that \"whatever can be shown to be unjust, involves a conflict with some obligation to which utility is subordinate, and ought therefore to be classed as a crime, though the obligation is of a less binding nature than that which exists in the case of actions directly injurious to others.\"\n\nThis suggests that Mill took the objection from justice very seriously and tried to integrate justice into his utilitarian framework.\n\nSimilarly, with duty, Mill might have seen it as derivative from the principle of utility, perhaps as a kind of rule utilitarianism where duties are rules that, if generally followed, promote the greatest happiness.\n\nWith virtue, Mill does emphasize the development of character and the importance of virtuous actions, but again, he sees these as contributing to overall happiness.\n\nSupererogation might be less central to Mill's discussion, although it's possible that he considered it an objection.\n\nGiven that, I'm leaning towards justice being the strongest objection that Mill acknowledged. He spends considerable time defending utilitarianism against the charge that it doesn't adequately account for justice, suggesting that justice is a fundamental aspect of utility itself.\n\nMoreover, the idea that utilitarianism might require sacrificing individual rights or justice for the greater good is a persistent criticism, and Mill's efforts to reconcile utility and justice indicate that he saw this as a significant challenge to his theory.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B. justice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
