                    "text": "So I have this question about convertible debentures. It says that a $500 par-value convertible debenture is selling at $520, and the conversion ratio is 20. I need to find the conversion price. The options are A. $19.23, B. $20.18, C. $25.00, and D. $26.00.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a convertible debenture is. From what I recall, a convertible debenture is a type of bond that can be converted into a specified number of shares of the issuer's stock. The par value is the face value of the bond, which is $500 in this case. The conversion ratio tells me how many shares I get for each bond converted. Here, the conversion ratio is 20, which means I get 20 shares for each bond I convert.\n\nThe conversion price is the price at which each share is bought when the bond is converted. So, if I have a bond with a par value of $500 and a conversion ratio of 20, the conversion price should be the total par value divided by the number of shares I get, which is the conversion ratio.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nConversion price = Par value / Conversion ratio\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nConversion price = $500 / 20\n\nConversion price = $25.00\n\nLooking at the options, C. $25.00 seems to be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure I'm not missing something. The bond is selling at $520, which is above its par value of $500. Does that affect the conversion price?\n\nI think not, because the conversion price is typically based on the par value of the bond, not its market price. The market price fluctuates based on interest rates and other market conditions, but the conversion price is set by the terms of the bond.\n\nSo, even though the bond is trading at $520, the conversion price should still be $25.00 per share, based on the par value and the conversion ratio.\n\nLet me double-check this concept. If I have a bond with a par value of $500 and a conversion ratio of 20, each share upon conversion would be worth $500 / 20 = $25.00. So, the conversion price is indeed $25.00.\n\nI don't think the market price of the bond affects the conversion price. The conversion price is a set term of the bond, and the market price is just what people are willing to pay for it at a particular time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. $25.00.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this. Maybe using the market price instead of the par value. If I use the market price of $520 and divide by the conversion ratio of 20, I get:\n\nConversion price = $520 / 20 = $26.00\n\nThat would be option D. But I don't think this is correct, because the conversion price is typically based on the par value, not the market price.\n\nWait a minute, maybe in some cases, the conversion price can be adjusted based on the market price, but I don't think that's generally the case. I believe the standard formula is par value divided by the conversion ratio.\n\nLet me check an example online or in a textbook to confirm.\n\nSuppose I have a bond with a par value of $1,000 and a conversion ratio of 50. The conversion price would be $1,000 / 50 = $20 per share. Similarly, if the par value is $1,000 and the conversion ratio is 25, the conversion price is $40 per share.\n\nIn neither case does the market price of the bond affect the conversion price. Therefore, in this problem, the conversion price should be $500 / 20 = $25.00.\n\nI think I was initially correct. The answer is C. $25.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
