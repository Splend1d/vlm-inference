                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about the hydrogen lines in the spectrum of a quasar called 3C9. It says that these lines are shifted so far into the red that their wavelengths are three times as long as those observed in the light from hydrogen atoms at rest in a laboratory on Earth. And I need to find the relative speed of the quasar assuming that the shift is entirely due to the relative motion between the quasar and Earth.\n\nFirst off, I know that when we talk about redshift in astronomy, it's usually because of the Doppler effect, which tells us how the wavelength of light changes due to the relative motion between the source and the observer. In this case, the quasar is moving away from Earth, causing the light to be shifted towards the red end of the spectrum.\n\nThe formula for the Doppler shift for light waves is given by:\n\n\\[\n1 + z = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{observed}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}} = \\frac{c}{c - v}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(z\\) is the redshift,\n\n- \\(\\lambda_{\\text{observed}}\\) is the wavelength we observe,\n\n- \\(\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}\\) is the wavelength of the source at rest,\n\n- \\(c\\) is the speed of light,\n\n- \\(v\\) is the velocity of the source away from the observer.\n\nGiven that the observed wavelength is three times the rest wavelength, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{observed}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}} = 3\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n1 + z = 3 \\implies z = 2\n\\]\n\nPlugging this back into the Doppler formula:\n\n\\[\n3 = \\frac{c}{c - v}\n\\]\n\nI need to solve for \\(v\\), the velocity of the quasar relative to Earth.\n\nLet's rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[\n3 = \\frac{c}{c - v}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\(c - v\\):\n\n\\[\n3(c - v) = c\n\\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[\n3c - 3v = c\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\(3c\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-3v = c - 3c\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-3v = -2c\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by -3:\n\n\\[\nv = \\frac{2c}{3} \\approx 0.666c\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, but none of the options match this. The closest is 0.5c, which is option D, but my calculation gives approximately 0.666c, which is 2/3 of the speed of light.\n\nI should double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{observed}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}} = 3\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n1 + z = 3 \\implies z = 2\n\\]\n\nAnd the Doppler formula is:\n\n\\[\n1 + z = \\frac{c}{c - v}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in \\(z = 2\\):\n\n\\[\n3 = \\frac{c}{c - v}\n\\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\n3(c - v) = c\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3c - 3v = c\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3c - c = 3v\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2c = 3v\n\\]\n\n\\[\nv = \\frac{2c}{3} \\approx 0.666c\n\\]\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the formula.\n\nLet me recall that for relativistic velocities, the Doppler shift formula should actually be:\n\n\\[\n1 + z = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1 + \\frac{v}{c}}{1 - \\frac{v}{c}} }\n\\]\n\nGiven that the observed wavelength is three times the rest wavelength, \\(z = 2\\), as previously determined.\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\n\\[\n2 = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1 + \\frac{v}{c}}{1 - \\frac{v}{c}} }\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[\n4 = \\frac{1 + \\frac{v}{c}}{1 - \\frac{v}{c}}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n4(1 - \\frac{v}{c}) = 1 + \\frac{v}{c}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4 - 4\\frac{v}{c} = 1 + \\frac{v}{c}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's collect like terms:\n\n\\[\n4 - 1 = 4\\frac{v}{c} + \\frac{v}{c}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3 = 5\\frac{v}{c}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v}{c} = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6c\n\\]\n\nWait, now I get \\(v = 0.6c\\), but earlier I had \\(v = 0.666c\\). Which one is correct?\n\nI think I made a mistake in the first approach by using the non-relativistic Doppler formula for light. The correct formula should indeed be the relativistic Doppler shift formula, which gives \\(v = 0.6c\\).\n\nBut looking back, in the first approach, I used \\(1 + z = \\frac{c}{c - v}\\), which is actually the non-relativistic approximation. For velocities close to the speed of light, we need to use the relativistic Doppler formula.\n\nSo, using the relativistic formula:\n\n\\[\n1 + z = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1 + \\frac{v}{c}}{1 - \\frac{v}{c}} } = 3\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 + \\frac{v}{c}}{1 - \\frac{v}{c}} = 9\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{v}{c} = 9 - 9\\frac{v}{c}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{v}{c} = 9 - 9\\frac{v}{c}\n\\]\n\nBring like terms together:\n\n\\[\n1 - 9 = -9\\frac{v}{c} - \\frac{v}{c}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-8 = -10\\frac{v}{c}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v}{c} = \\frac{8}{10} = 0.8c\n\\]\n\nWait, now I have \\(v = 0.8c\\). But earlier I got \\(v = 0.6c\\). There's inconsistency here.\n\nI must have made another mistake.\n\nLet me correct the algebra.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n3 = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1 + \\frac{v}{c}}{1 - \\frac{v}{c}} }\n\\]\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n\\[\n9 = \\frac{1 + \\frac{v}{c}}{1 - \\frac{v}{c}}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n9(1 - \\frac{v}{c}) = 1 + \\frac{v}{c}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n9 - 9\\frac{v}{c} = 1 + \\frac{v}{c}\n\\]\n\nBring like terms together:\n\n\\[\n9 - 1 = 9\\frac{v}{c} + \\frac{v}{c}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n8 = 10\\frac{v}{c}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v}{c} = \\frac{8}{10} = 0.8\n\\]\n\n\\[\nv = 0.8c\n\\]\n\nAh, now I see. The correct calculation gives \\(v = 0.8c\\), which is option C.\n\nI must have made an algebraic error in my previous steps. The correct answer should be \\(v = 0.8c\\).\n\nTherefore, the relative speed of the quasar is 0.8 times the speed of light, or 80% of the speed of light.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 0.8c.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
