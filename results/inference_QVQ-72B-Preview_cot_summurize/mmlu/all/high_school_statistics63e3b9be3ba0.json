                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about normal distributions and z-scores. Let me try to understand what's being asked.\n\nWe have a student who took a midterm and a final exam. The midterm scores are normally distributed with a mean of 52 points and a standard deviation of 4 points. This same student scored 58 on the midterm. Now, the final exam scores are also normally distributed but with a different mean and standard deviation: 112 points and 10 points, respectively.\n\nThe question is, if the student had the same standardized score, or z-score, on the final exam as she did on the midterm, what must her score have been on the final?\n\nOkay, so first, I need to recall what a z-score is. A z-score measures how many standard deviations a particular value is from the mean. The formula for z-score is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(x - \\text{mean})}{\\text{standard deviation}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(x\\) is the value from the dataset.\n\n- Mean is the average of all the values.\n\n- Standard deviation measures the spread or variability of the data.\n\nSo, for the midterm, the student scored 58 points, with a mean of 52 and SD of 4. Let's calculate her z-score for the midterm.\n\n\\[ z_{\\text{midterm}} = \\frac{(58 - 52)}{4} = \\frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \\]\n\nSo, her midterm score is 1.5 standard deviations above the mean.\n\nNow, for the final exam, we need her score to have the same z-score, which is 1.5.\n\nSo, using the z-score formula again for the final exam:\n\n\\[ z_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{(x_{\\text{final}} - \\text{mean}_{\\text{final}})}{\\text{SD}_{\\text{final}}} \\]\n\nWe know that \\( z_{\\text{final}} = 1.5 \\), \\( \\text{mean}_{\\text{final}} = 112 \\), and \\( \\text{SD}_{\\text{final}} = 10 \\). Plugging in these values:\n\n\\[ 1.5 = \\frac{(x_{\\text{final}} - 112)}{10} \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( x_{\\text{final}} \\):\n\n\\[ x_{\\text{final}} - 112 = 1.5 \\times 10 \\]\n\n\\[ x_{\\text{final}} - 112 = 15 \\]\n\n\\[ x_{\\text{final}} = 112 + 15 \\]\n\n\\[ x_{\\text{final}} = 127 \\]\n\nSo, her score on the final exam must have been 127 points to have the same z-score as her midterm.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 15 points\n\nB. 58 points\n\nC. 118 points\n\nD. 127 points\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. 127 points.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, z-score for midterm:\n\n\\[ z_{\\text{midterm}} = \\frac{58 - 52}{4} = \\frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \\]\n\nThat's correct.\n\nThen, for the final exam, using the same z-score:\n\n\\[ 1.5 = \\frac{x_{\\text{final}} - 112}{10} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x_{\\text{final}} \\):\n\n\\[ x_{\\text{final}} - 112 = 1.5 \\times 10 = 15 \\]\n\n\\[ x_{\\text{final}} = 112 + 15 = 127 \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in another way to confirm.\n\nSince the z-score is the same for both exams, the student's performance relative to the class mean is the same in both exams.\n\nOn the midterm, she scored 58, which is 6 points above the mean of 52.\n\nSimilarly, on the final, the mean is 112, so adding 6 points would give 118, which is option C.\n\nWait a second, that's different from what I calculated earlier. So, where's the mistake?\n\nOh, I see. The z-score is not just about the difference from the mean, but about how many standard deviations that difference represents.\n\nIn the first approach, I correctly calculated the z-score for the midterm as 1.5, and then used that to find the corresponding score on the final exam.\n\nBut in the second approach, I mistakenly assumed that since she scored 6 points above the mean on the midterm, she should score 6 points above the mean on the final. But that's not necessarily true because the standard deviations are different.\n\nLet me see:\n\nOn the midterm, 6 points is how many standard deviations?\n\nWell, SD is 4, so 6/4 = 1.5 SDs, which matches the z-score.\n\nOn the final, SD is 10, so to have the same z-score of 1.5, she needs to be 1.5 * 10 = 15 points above the mean.\n\nMean is 112, so score should be 112 + 15 = 127.\n\nYes, that confirms the first approach.\n\nSo, the second approach was misleading because it didn't account for the different standard deviations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is indeed D. 127 points.\n\nI think that's solid. No further confusion here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{127} \\]"
