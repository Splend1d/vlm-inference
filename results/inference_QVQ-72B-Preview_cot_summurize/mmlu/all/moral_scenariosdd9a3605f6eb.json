                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of these standards, but I think if I apply general moral principles, I can get a sense of what's right and wrong here.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I laughed as a midget walked by me humming the willy wanka song.\"\n\nOkay, so there are a few things that jump out at me here. First off, the term \"midget\" is considered offensive and derogatory by many people. It's an outdated term that was sometimes used to describe people with dwarfism, but it's not acceptable to use that kind of language. Using such terms can be hurtful and disrespectful to individuals with differences in stature.\n\nAdditionally, the action of laughing at someone walking by while they're humming a song seems insensitive. It implies that the person is being mocked or made fun of because of their appearance or the song they're humming. Mocking someone based on their physical characteristics or innocent actions like humming a song is generally considered rude and lacking in empathy.\n\nSo, in this scenario, there are elements of using offensive language and mocking someone, which together suggest that this behavior is morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I denied the help of someone who said they would babysit my children for free.\"\n\nThis one is a bit different. Here, someone offers to babysit your children for free, and you decline their offer. Denying help that's been offered voluntarily doesn't seem inherently morally wrong. The person offering to babysit is doing so out of kindness, and it's your right to accept or decline their offer based on your own preferences or circumstances.\n\nPerhaps you have other plans, or you prefer to spend time with your children yourself, or maybe you're uncomfortable with the idea of someone else taking care of your kids for free. There could be many reasons why you might decline such an offer, and none of them necessarily make your decision morally wrong.\n\nIn fact, in some cases, accepting free babysitting might even be seen as taking advantage of someone's kindness, especially if you don't reciprocate in some way. But even then, it's still your choice whether to accept or decline, and declining isn't inherently wrong unless there are specific contexts I'm not considering here.\n\nBased on the information provided, it seems that denying someone's offer to babysit for free isn't morally wrong, whereas laughing at a person while using offensive language is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to this analysis, the answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing in either scenario.\n\nIn Scenario 1, using offensive language and laughing at someone because of their appearance or innocent actions is clearly inappropriate and morally wrong. In Scenario 2, declining a free babysitting offer doesn't seem to be morally wrong; it's just exercising your right to choose what's best for you and your family.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a different perspective. Some people might argue that declining free babysitting is selfish, especially if the person offering is a family member or a close friend. But even then, it's still up to the individual to decide what's best for their situation.\n\nUnless there are extenuating circumstances, like you're in desperate need of help and refusing it causes harm to someone else, but the scenario doesn't specify that.\n\nSo, I think my initial assessment stands. Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
