                    "text": " So I'm looking at this premise from Singer's main argument: \"If it is in your power to prevent something bad from happening, without sacrificing anything nearly as important, it is wrong not to do so.\" And the question is asking which phrase in this premise is deliberately left vague. The options are A. \"something bad,\" B. \"it is wrong,\" C. \"nearly as important,\" or D. \"in your power.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"deliberately left vague\" means. I think it means that the phrase is intentionally not clearly defined, maybe to make the argument more flexible or to avoid specific commitments. So, I should look for the phrase that isn't precisely defined in the context of the argument.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: \"something bad.\" What constitutes \"something bad\"? Well, this seems pretty open-ended. Different people might have different ideas about what is bad. For example, some might consider poverty bad, while others might consider environmental damage bad. So, this phrase could be interpreted in many ways depending on the situation and the person's values. But is this deliberate? Maybe. It might be intentional to keep it broad so that it applies to a wide range of scenarios.\n\nOption B: \"it is wrong.\" This seems like a moral statement. Determining what is right or wrong can be subjective and varies across different ethical frameworks. However, in the context of the premise, it's being used to make a general moral claim. But again, without specifying what makes something wrong, it's quite vague. But I think the focus here is more on the action of preventing bad things rather than defining what wrong is.\n\nOption C: \"nearly as important.\" This one seems particularly vague. What does \"nearly as important\" mean? How close to the importance of the bad thing does something have to be to make sacrificing it acceptable? Is there a quantitative measure, or is it qualitative? This seems quite fuzzy. Maybe it's left vague to allow for judgment calls in different situations.\n\nOption D: \"in your power.\" This seems straightforward at first glance. It means that you have the ability or means to prevent the bad thing from happening. But even here, there might be ambiguity. For example, does \"in your power\" include situations where you have to ask others for help, or is it only what you can do individually? Also, sometimes, what seems possible might not be practically feasible due to various constraints.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, I need to decide which one is most deliberately left vague. Both A and C seem quite vague, but C, \"nearly as important,\" stands out as particularly unclear. The term \"nearly\" is relative and can vary significantly based on context and personal judgment. For instance, if preventing a bad thing requires sacrificing something that is almost as bad, how does one measure and compare these bad things? It's not specified.\n\nOn the other hand, \"something bad\" is vague but might be intentionally broad to cover a wide range of negative outcomes. \"It is wrong\" is a moral assertion, but the vagueness there seems more about the nature of morality itself rather than a deliberate ambiguity in the premise.\n\n\"In your power\" could be vague in terms of what exactly constitutes one's capabilities, but I think it's less deliberately vague compared to \"nearly as important.\"\n\nTherefore, I would say that C. \"nearly as important\" is the phrase that is most deliberately left vague in this premise.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
