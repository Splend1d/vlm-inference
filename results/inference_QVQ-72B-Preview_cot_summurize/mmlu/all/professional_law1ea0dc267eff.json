                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out what crime the friend can be convicted of. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, a young man suggests to his friend that they steal a large-screen TV from a neighbor's house. But the friend is actually angry with the young man and wants to get revenge by getting him arrested. So, the friend agrees to help, planning all along to betray the young man.\n\nOn the night of the planned theft, the friend drives the young man to the neighbor's house. The young man goes in to break in, while the friend stays outside. Instead of waiting, the friend calls the police on his cell phone and drives away. The police arrive just as the young man is carrying the TV out the back door.\n\nNow, the jurisdiction defines crimes at common law. So, I need to recall what common law says about the crimes mentioned: conspiracy, burglary, and larceny.\n\nLet's start with conspiracy. At common law, conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit an unlawful act, coupled with an overt act in furtherance of that agreement. The key elements are the agreement and the overt act.\n\nIn this case, the young man and the friend agreed to steal the TV. They had a plan to break into the neighbor's house and take the TV. The friend drove the young man to the house, which could be considered an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\nHowever, the friend's intention was to get the young man arrested, not to actually steal the TV. Does this affect the conspiracy charge?\n\nWell, in conspiracy law, the agreement is between the parties to commit the crime, regardless of whether the crime is actually completed. So, even if the friend didn't intend to go through with the theft, the agreement was there, and there was an overt act in furtherance of the agreement.\n\nSo, the friend could potentially be charged with conspiracy.\n\nNext, burglary. At common law, burglary is the breaking and entering of a dwelling house at night with intent to commit a felony therein. Key elements are breaking and entering, dwelling house, night, and intent to commit a felony.\n\nIn this scenario, the young man broke into the neighbor's house at night with the intent to steal a TV, which is a felony. So, the young man committed burglary.\n\nBut what about the friend? He stayed outside and called the police. Did he participate in the burglary?\n\nGenerally, to be an accomplice to burglary, the friend would need to have aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, or encouraged the young man to commit the burglary.\n\nHowever, in this case, the friend's actions were aimed at getting the young man arrested, not at helping him commit the burglary. In fact, by calling the police, the friend was trying to prevent the burglary from succeeding.\n\nSo, it seems unlikely that the friend can be convicted of burglary because his actions were against the success of the burglary.\n\nNow, larceny. At common law, larceny is the trespassory taking and carrying away of personal property of another with intent to deprive the owner permanently of it.\n\nIn this scenario, the young man took the TV and was carrying it away when the police arrived. So, he committed larceny.\n\nBut again, what about the friend? He was outside, didn't take anything, and his actions were aimed at getting the young man arrested.\n\nSo, it doesn't seem like the friend can be convicted of larceny because he didn't participate in taking or carrying away the property.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's something called attempted larceny or something, but I don't think that applies here.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the friend can be charged with being an accessory before the fact to burglary or larceny.\n\nBut again, his intentions were to get the young man arrested, not to help him commit the crimes.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, if someone agrees to commit a crime but then withdraws and instead helps prevent the crime, they might not be liable for conspiracy or accomplice liability.\n\nBut in this case, the friend didn't withdraw from the conspiracy; he just had a different goal\u2014to get the young man arrested.\n\nSo, perhaps the friend can still be charged with conspiracy but not with burglary or larceny.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the friend can be charged with both conspiracy and larceny or burglary, depending on how the laws are interpreted.\n\nBut the question says \"of what crime, if any, can the friend properly be convicted?\"\n\nGiven that the friend participated in the conspiracy to steal the TV, he could be convicted of conspiracy.\n\nHowever, since he didn't actually participate in the burglary or larceny and instead tried to thwart them by calling the police, it's less clear if he can be convicted of burglary or larceny.\n\nMaybe the answer is conspiracy and larceny, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let's look at the options again:\n\nA. No crime.\n\nB. Conspiracy.\n\nC. Burglary.\n\nD. Conspiracy and larceny.\n\nGiven that the friend was part of the conspiracy, he can be charged with conspiracy.\n\nBut for burglary and larceny, since he didn't participate in those acts and instead tried to prevent them, it's unlikely he can be charged with those crimes.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer seems to be B. Conspiracy.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any possibility that the friend can be charged with both conspiracy and larceny?\n\nWell, conspiracy is a separate crime from the substantive offenses like burglary and larceny. So, it's possible to be charged with both.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, since the friend didn't actually commit burglary or larceny and instead acted to prevent them, it seems unfair to charge him with those crimes.\n\nMaybe the answer is D. Conspiracy and larceny, but I have doubts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is A. No crime, but that seems incorrect because the friend did conspire to commit a crime.\n\nNo, I think the correct answer is B. Conspiracy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
