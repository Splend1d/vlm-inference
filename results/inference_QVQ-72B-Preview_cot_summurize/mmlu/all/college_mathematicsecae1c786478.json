                    "text": "So I've got this problem about finite groups. It says that if a finite group G contains a subgroup of order seven, but no element other than the identity is its own inverse, then I need to figure out what the possible orders of G could be from the options: 27, 28, 35, or 37.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a group to have a subgroup of order seven. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup must divide the order of the group. So, if G has a subgroup of order seven, then the order of G must be divisible by seven. Looking at the options, 27 is not divisible by seven, 28 is (since 7*4=28), 35 is (7*5=35), and 37 is not. So, right off the bat, I can eliminate options A and D because 27 and 37 are not divisible by seven.\n\nNow, I need to consider the second condition: no element other than the identity is its own inverse. That means that for every element g in G except the identity, g\u00b2 \u2260 e, where e is the identity element.\n\nI need to see which of the remaining options, 28 or 35, satisfy this condition.\n\nLet's recall that in a group, if an element is its own inverse, then g\u00b2 = e. If no element other than the identity satisfies this, then in the group, every non-identity element has an order greater than 2.\n\nWait a minute, but the group has a subgroup of order seven, which is cyclic since seven is prime, so it's isomorphic to Z7, and in Z7, every non-identity element has order seven. So, in G, there is at least one subgroup where non-identity elements have order seven.\n\nBut the condition says no element other than the identity is its own inverse, which means no non-identity element has order 2.\n\nSo, I need to ensure that in G, no non-identity element has order 2.\n\nNow, let's think about the structure of groups of order 28 and 35.\n\nFirst, order 28: factorize 28, which is 2\u00b2 * 7. So, by the Sylow theorems, there are Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 7-subgroups.\n\nLet's denote the number of Sylow 7-subgroups as n7, which must divide 4 (since 28/7=4), and n7 \u2261 1 mod 7. The only possibility is n7=1. So, there is only one Sylow 7-subgroup, which is normal in G.\n\nSimilarly, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n2, must divide 7 (since 28/4=7), and n2 \u2261 1 mod 2. So, n2 can be 1 or 7.\n\nNow, since the Sylow 7-subgroup is normal, and the Sylow 2-subgroup may or may not be normal, I need to consider the possible structures of G.\n\nBut more importantly, I need to ensure that no non-identity element has order 2.\n\nIn a group of order 28, the Sylow 7-subgroup is cyclic of order 7, and the Sylow 2-subgroup is either of order 4 or 8, depending on n2.\n\nWait, no, 28 divided by 4 is 7, so n2 can be 1 or 7.\n\nIf n2=1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal.\n\nIf n2=7, then there are seven Sylow 2-subgroups.\n\nNow, in a group of order 28, the structure can vary, but one common structure is the dihedral group D14, which has order 28.\n\nIn D14, there are elements of order 2, which are the reflections.\n\nBut according to the problem, no non-identity element should be its own inverse, meaning no non-identity element has order 2.\n\nSo, if G is isomorphic to D14, then it wouldn't satisfy the condition because D14 has elements of order 2.\n\nTherefore, G cannot be D14.\n\nSo, perhaps G is an abelian group.\n\nIf G is abelian, then since it has order 28, which is 2\u00b2 * 7, its possible structures are:\n\n- Z28\n\n- Z4 \u00d7 Z7\n\n- Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u00d7 Z7\n\nNow, in Z28, the elements of order 2 are those that satisfy x\u00b2 = e. In Z28, the identity is 0, and the elements of order dividing 2 are those where 2x = 0.\n\nIn Z28, 2x = 0 mod 28 implies x = 14 mod 28. So, only x=14 has order 2, besides the identity.\n\nBut the problem says no non-identity element is its own inverse, meaning no non-identity element has order 2.\n\nSo, in Z28, x=14 has order 2, which violates the condition.\n\nTherefore, G cannot be Z28.\n\nNext, consider Z4 \u00d7 Z7.\n\nThe elements of Z4 \u00d7 Z7 have orders that are the least common multiple of their components' orders.\n\nThe identity is (0,0). Non-identity elements:\n\n- (1,0): order lcm(4,7)=28\n\n- (2,0): order 2\n\n- (3,0): order 4\n\n- (0,1): order 7\n\n- (1,1): order lcm(4,7)=28\n\n- (2,1): order lcm(2,7)=14\n\n- (3,1): order lcm(4,7)=28\n\n- (0,2): order 7\n\n- (1,2): order lcm(4,7)=28\n\n- (2,2): order lcm(2,7)=14\n\n- (3,2): order lcm(4,7)=28\n\n- (0,3): order 7\n\n- (1,3): order lcm(4,7)=28\n\n- (2,3): order lcm(2,7)=14\n\n- (3,3): order lcm(4,7)=28\n\nSo, elements (2,0) and (2,2) have order 2, which again violates the condition.\n\nTherefore, G cannot be Z4 \u00d7 Z7.\n\nNext, Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u00d7 Z7.\n\nThe identity is (0,0,0). Non-identity elements:\n\n- Elements with one 1 in their first two components: order 2\n\n- Elements with two 1's in the first two components: order 2\n\n- Elements with a 1 in the third component: order 7\n\n- Combinations of these\n\nSpecifically, the order of an element is the least common multiple of the orders of its components.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- (1,0,0): order 2\n\n- (0,1,0): order 2\n\n- (1,1,0): order lcm(2,2)=2\n\n- (0,0,1): order 7\n\n- (1,0,1): order lcm(2,7)=14\n\n- (0,1,1): order lcm(2,7)=14\n\n- (1,1,1): order lcm(2,7)=14\n\nSo, again, there are elements of order 2, namely (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (1,1,0).\n\nThus, Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u00d7 Z7 also has elements of order 2.\n\nTherefore, none of the abelian groups of order 28 satisfy the condition that no non-identity element is its own inverse.\n\nSo, perhaps there are non-abelian groups of order 28 that do satisfy this condition.\n\nEarlier, I mentioned D14, which is a non-abelian group of order 28, but it has elements of order 2.\n\nSo, if G is D14, it doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nAre there other non-abelian groups of order 28?\n\nWell, according to group theory, for a group of order pq\u00b2 where p and q are primes with p < q and q\u00b2 \u2261 1 mod p, there are only two possibilities: the group is either abelian or a semi-direct product.\n\nIn this case, p=2 and q=7, and 7\u00b2=49, which is not \u22611 mod 2, so perhaps there are only two groups of order 28: the cyclic one and the dihedral one.\n\nWait, actually, for order 28, there are three groups: the cyclic group Z28, the dihedral group D14, and the direct product Z4 \u00d7 Z7.\n\nBut earlier, I saw that Z4 \u00d7 Z7 has elements of order 2.\n\nIs there a way for a group of order 28 to not have elements of order 2 besides the identity?\n\nIt seems not, based on the above analysis.\n\nSo, perhaps 28 is not a possible order for G under the given conditions.\n\nNow, let's look at order 35.\n\n35 factors into 5 * 7.\n\nBy Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups n5 must divide 7 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possibility is n5=1.\n\nSimilarly, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups n7 must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 7. The only possibility is n7=1.\n\nTherefore, both Sylow 5 and Sylow 7 subgroups are unique and normal in G.\n\nSo, G must be a direct product of its Sylow subgroups.\n\nThat is, G \u2245 Z5 \u00d7 Z7.\n\nSince 5 and 7 are coprime, Z5 \u00d7 Z7 is isomorphic to Z35.\n\nSo, G is cyclic of order 35.\n\nNow, in Z35, the elements have orders that divide 35.\n\nThe possible orders are 1, 5, 7, and 35.\n\nThe identity has order 1.\n\nElements of order 5 have order 5, meaning they generate a subgroup of order 5.\n\nSimilarly, elements of order 7 generate a subgroup of order 7.\n\nNow, the problem is to ensure that no non-identity element is its own inverse.\n\nIn Z35, an element x is its own inverse if 2x \u2261 0 mod 35.\n\nSo, 2x \u2261 0 mod 35 implies x \u2261 0 mod 35/ gcd(2,35).\n\nSince gcd(2,35)=1, x \u2261 0 mod 35, meaning only the identity satisfies this.\n\nTherefore, in Z35, no non-identity element is its own inverse.\n\nSo, a group of order 35 satisfies the condition.\n\nTherefore, the possible order of G is 35.\n\nLooking back at the options, 35 is option C.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 35.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
