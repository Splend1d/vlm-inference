She was running late for the meeting and could not find a legal parking spot, so she decided to park illegally in front of a fire hydrant. This was in violation of a local ordinance that prohibited parking within 50 feet of a fire hydrant. The lawyer figured that it was better to get a ticket than to miss her meeting with an important client. The spot where she parked was next to the site of the construction of the new building. While the lawyer was at her meeting, an accident occurred at the construction site. A large crane was being used to lift a load of bricks. A cable on the crane broke, and the bricks fell. Most of them landed on top of the lawyer's car. The load of bricks that fell on the lawyer's car caused the gas tank of the car to rupture and explode. Shrapnel from the explosion flew in all directions and injured a pedestrian who was talking on the sidewalk near the lawyer's car. If the pedestrian sues the lawyer and relies on the doctrine of negligence per Se, which of the following, if true, is the lawyer's best defense?\n\nA. Payment of a small fine is the only penalty provided in the ordinance for those who park too close to fire hydrants.\nB. The police never issued a ticket to the lawyer for parking in front of the fire hydrant.\nC.

                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario. There's a lawyer who parked her car illegally in front of a fire hydrant because she was late for a meeting. Then, during her meeting, there was an accident at a nearby construction site where bricks fell from a crane and landed on her car, causing it to explode. A pedestrian nearby got injured from the explosion and wants to sue the lawyer using the doctrine of negligence per se. I need to find out which defense would be best for the lawyer in this situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what negligence per se is. From what I recall, negligence per se is a legal doctrine that says if someone violates a statute or ordinance that's designed to protect a certain class of people, and that violation causes injury to someone in that class, then the violator is automatically considered negligent. So, in this case, the pedestrian is claiming that the lawyer's illegal parking caused the injury, and because the parking violated a local ordinance, the lawyer is automatically negligent.\n\nBut the lawyer can defend against this by showing that the ordinance wasn't intended to protect against the type of harm that occurred here. So, if the parking ordinance was meant to prevent obstruction of fire trucks in case of a fire, and the harm that occurred was from a construction accident causing bricks to fall on the car and explode, then maybe the ordinance wasn't meant to protect against that specific kind of harm.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. Payment of a small fine is the only penalty provided in the ordinance for those who park too close to fire hydrants.\n\nSo, this is about the penalty for violating the ordinance. But negligence per se is about the violation of the ordinance leading to negligence. The severity of the penalty might not directly relate to whether the violation caused the harm or whether the ordinance was intended to prevent that specific harm.\n\nB. The police never issued a ticket to the lawyer for parking in front of the fire hydrant.\n\nThis seems irrelevant because whether a ticket was issued or not doesn't change the fact that the parking ordinance was violated. The violation itself is what triggers the negligence per se doctrine, not whether a ticket was issued.\n\nC. The purpose of the parking ordinance was to facilitate access to the hydrant by fire trucks, not to protect against accidents like the one that occurred when bricks fell on the lawyer's car.\n\nThis seems promising. If the ordinance was intended to ensure that fire trucks could access the hydrant in case of a fire, and the harm that occurred was from a construction accident unrelated to fire access, then maybe the violation of the ordinance wasn't directly related to the cause of the injury. So, perhaps the pedestrian can't rely on negligence per se because the harm wasn't the type the ordinance was designed to prevent.\n\nD. The pedestrian would not have been injured if the construction company had properly maintained the crane.\n\nThis points to the construction company's negligence as the cause of the injury, but it doesn't directly address whether the lawyer's violation of the parking ordinance was a cause of the injury. Even if the construction company was negligent, the lawyer's illegal parking might still be a contributing factor if, for example, the car's position made the explosion worse or put the pedestrian in harm's way.\n\nSo, between these options, C seems to be the strongest defense. It goes to the heart of the negligence per se doctrine by arguing that the ordinance wasn't intended to prevent the type of harm that occurred here. The other options don't directly address the connection between the ordinance violation and the harm suffered by the pedestrian.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Negligence per se requires that the violation of the ordinance caused the harm and that the harm was of the type the ordinance was intended to prevent. If the ordinance was only meant to prevent obstruction of fire trucks, and the harm here was from a construction accident, then the violation of the parking ordinance wasn't the cause of the harm in the way the ordinance was designed to prevent.\n\nSo, the lawyer can argue that the pedestrian can't rely on negligence per se because the harm wasn't within the protective scope of the ordinance. Therefore, the pedestrian would have to prove negligence in the traditional way, which might be more difficult.\n\nIn summary, option C seems to be the best defense for the lawyer in this scenario.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
