                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It wants to know what 60% of 30 is. Okay, so percentages have always been a bit tricky for me, but I think I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a percentage means. Percentage basically means \"per hundred,\" right? So, 60% means 60 out of 100. But here, it's not out of 100; it's out of 30. Hmm, I need to find a way to apply that.\n\nOne way I've learned to find a percentage of a number is to turn the percentage into a decimal and then multiply it by the number. So, 60% as a decimal is 0.60. Does that make sense? Let me think about that.\n\nTo convert a percentage to a decimal, I should divide it by 100. So, 60 divided by 100 is indeed 0.60. Okay, that seems right. Now, I need to multiply that decimal by 30 to find 60% of 30.\n\nSo, 0.60 times 30. Let's do that calculation. 0.60 multiplied by 30 is the same as 0.6 multiplied by 30. Wait, is that correct? Actually, no. 0.60 is the same as 0.6, so it's just 0.6 times 30.\n\nLet me calculate that. 0.6 times 30. Well, 0.6 times 30 is the same as 6 tenths times 30. So, 6 tenths times 30 would be 18. Wait, is that right? Let me think differently.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of fractions. Since 60% is the same as 60/100, which simplifies to 3/5, I can find 3/5 of 30. That might be easier for me.\n\nSo, 3/5 of 30. To find a fraction of a number, I can multiply the fraction by the number. So, 3/5 times 30. Let's do that. 3/5 times 30 is equal to (3 times 30) divided by 5. That's 90 divided by 5, which is 18.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation using decimals. So, both methods give me the same answer of 18. Let me just double-check if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nIs there a possibility that the question is asking for something else besides just finding 60% of 30? No, it seems straightforward: it wants 60% of 30, which should be 18.\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Maybe I should consider the context. Is there any context that suggests otherwise? No, it's a simple percentage question.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find 60% of 30. Percent means per hundred, so 60% of 30 is the same as 60 per hundred of 30. So, if 100% of 30 is 30, then 60% would be 60 divided by 100 times 30.\n\nLet me calculate that: 60 divided by 100 is 0.6, and 0.6 times 30 is 18. Again, the same answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with this result. Let me just check the options provided:\n\nA. 1.8\n\nB. 18\n\nC. 180\n\nD. 1800\n\nGiven that 60% of 30 is 18, the correct choice is B. 18.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any trick here. Maybe the question is testing whether I know that percentage is out of 100, and if I mistakenly calculate it differently.\n\nFor example, if I misread 60% as 60/30, but no, that doesn't make sense in this context. Or maybe if I accidentally calculate 30% instead of 60%, but I don't think that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a unit conversion involved, but the question doesn't specify any units, so that's probably not relevant here.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the question is about simple interest or something, but no, it's just asking for 60% of 30.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. It's a straightforward percentage calculation, and 60% of 30 is indeed 18.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. 18.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 18} \\]"
