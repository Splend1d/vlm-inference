                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which is a characteristic unique to angiosperms?\" and the options are:\n\nA. Wind-borne pollen\n\nB. A dominant sporophyte life cycle\n\nC. Alteration of generations\n\nD. Double fertilization\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to identify which of these options is exclusively found in angiosperms, which are flowering plants, right?\n\nFirst off, let's recall what angiosperms are. They're the group of plants that produce flowers and fruits, and they're the most diverse and widespread group of plants on Earth.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Wind-borne pollen.\n\nI know that some angiosperms, like grasses and trees such as oaks and elms, do produce wind-borne pollen. But wait, isn't pollen also dispersed by wind in some non-angiosperms, like gymnosperms, which include conifers like pines and firs? I think so. So, if both angiosperms and gymnosperms can have wind-borne pollen, then this isn't unique to angiosperms.\n\nOption B: A dominant sporophyte life cycle.\n\nLet me think about the life cycle of plants. Most plants have an alternation of generations, where there's a sporophyte stage and a gametophyte stage. In angiosperms, the sporophyte generation is dominant, meaning it's the larger, more prominent stage, and the gametophytes are reduced and dependent on the sporophyte.\n\nBut, is this characteristic unique to angiosperms? I don't think so. Gymnosperms also have a dominant sporophyte generation, although their gametophytes are slightly more developed than those of angiosperms. Even some ferns have a dominant sporophyte, though their gametophytes are free-living and photosynthetic. So, this isn't unique to angiosperms.\n\nOption C: Alteration of generations.\n\nThis is a fundamental feature of plant life cycles. All plants, from mosses to angiosperms, exhibit some form of alternation between sporophyte and gametophyte generations. So, this is not unique to angiosperms at all.\n\nOption D: Double fertilization.\n\nNow, this sounds promising. I recall that double fertilization is a process unique to angiosperms. Let me make sure I understand what it is.\n\nIn angiosperms, when pollen lands on a compatible stigma, it germinates and grows a pollen tube down through the style to reach the ovule. Inside the ovule, there's an embryo sac that contains several nuclei. During fertilization, the pollen tube releases two sperm cells into the embryo sac. One sperm fertilizes the egg cell, forming the zygote, which will develop into the embryo. The other sperm fuses with two polar nuclei, forming a triploid cell that will develop into the endosperm, which is the nutrient-rich tissue that feeds the developing embryo.\n\nThis dual fertilization event\u2014where one sperm fertilizes the egg and the other fuses with the polar nuclei\u2014is called double fertilization. It's a key characteristic of angiosperms and doesn't occur in any other group of plants.\n\nSo, based on this, double fertilization is unique to angiosperms.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that some gymnosperms might have a similar process? I don't think so. Gymnosperms, like conifers, have a different reproductive process. They produce seeds but lack the specialized structures like flowers and fruits found in angiosperms. Their reproductive cycle doesn't involve double fertilization.\n\nTherefore, double fertilization is indeed a characteristic unique to angiosperms.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if there are any exceptions or special cases where double fertilization might occur outside of angiosperms. I can't think of any. All non-angiosperm plants, including bryophytes, ferns, and gymnosperms, have different mechanisms for fertilization.\n\nSo, I'm confident that double fertilization is a unique characteristic of angiosperms.\n\nIn conclusion, among the given options, option D, double fertilization, is the characteristic that is uniquely found in angiosperms.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
