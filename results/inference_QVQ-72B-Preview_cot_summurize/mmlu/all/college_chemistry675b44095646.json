                    "text": "So I have this question here about lattice enthalpy, and I need to figure out which of these ionic substances has the greatest lattice enthalpy. The options are MgO, MgS, NaF, and NaCl. I'm not super familiar with lattice enthalpy, but I think it has something to do with the energy released when ions come together to form a crystal lattice. So, probably, the stronger the bonds between the ions, the higher the lattice enthalpy.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what factors affect lattice enthalpy. I think charge and size of the ions are important. Like, higher charges mean stronger attractions and therefore higher lattice energies. And smaller ions also lead to stronger attractions because they can get closer together.\n\nLet me list out the compounds again:\n\nA. MgO\n\nB. MgS\n\nC. NaF\n\nD. NaCl\n\nI need to compare their lattice enthalpies based on the charges and sizes of their ions.\n\nStarting with the charges:\n\nFor MgO, magnesium is +2 and oxygen is -2.\n\nFor MgS, magnesium is +2 and sulfur is -2.\n\nFor NaF, sodium is +1 and fluorine is -1.\n\nFor NaCl, sodium is +1 and chlorine is -1.\n\nSo, MgO and MgS have higher charges involved (+2 and -2) compared to NaF and NaCl, which have +1 and -1.\n\nGenerally, higher charges should lead to higher lattice enthalpies because the attractions between the ions are stronger.\n\nBut wait, there's also the size of the ions. Smaller ions should lead to stronger attractions because they can be closer together, leading to higher lattice enthalpies.\n\nSo, between MgO and MgS, which has smaller ions?\n\nLet me think about the ionic radii. Magnesium and sodium are both in group 1A, but magnesium is in period 3 and sodium in period 2, so magnesium ion is larger than sodium ion. Oxygen is in group 6A and period 2, fluorine is also in period 2 but group 7A, and chlorine is in group 7A and period 3.\n\nWait, actually, I need to be careful with the ionic radii. Let's recall:\n\n- Na+ is smaller than Mg2+\n\n- O2- is smaller than S2-\n\n- F- is smaller than Cl-\n\nSo, in MgO versus MgS, O2- is smaller than S2-, so MgO should have a higher lattice enthalpy than MgS because the smaller ions are closer together, leading to stronger attractions.\n\nSimilarly, in NaF versus NaCl, F- is smaller than Cl-, so NaF should have a higher lattice enthalpy than NaCl.\n\nBut between MgO and NaF, both have smaller ions compared to their counterparts, but MgO has higher charges (+2 and -2) versus NaF has +1 and -1.\n\nSo, MgO should have a much higher lattice enthalpy due to the higher charge densities.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Is there a formula for lattice enthalpy?\n\nI think there's the Born-Land\u00e9 equation or the Born-Haber cycle that can be used to calculate lattice enthalpies. The Born-Land\u00e9 equation is something like:\n\nU = (N * A * z+ * z- * e^2) / (r * (1 - (1 / n)))\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is Avogadro's number\n\n- A is a constant\n\n- z+ and z- are the charges of the ions\n\n- e is the elementary charge\n\n- r is the distance between the ions (related to ionic radii)\n\n- n is the Born exponent, which depends on the crystal structure\n\nFrom this, we can see that lattice energy U increases with higher charges (z+ and z-) and decreases with larger ionic radii (r).\n\nSo, higher charges and smaller radii lead to higher lattice enthalpies.\n\nTherefore, comparing MgO and NaF:\n\n- MgO has higher charges (+2 and -2) and smaller ions (Mg2+ is larger than Na+, but O2- is smaller than F-)\n\nWait, actually, Na+ is smaller than Mg2+, and F- is smaller than O2-. Wait, no, let's check the ionic radii.\n\nSodium ion (Na+) is about 102 pm\n\nMagnesium ion (Mg2+) is about 72 pm\n\nOxygen ion (O2-) is about 140 pm\n\nSulfur ion (S2-) is about 184 pm\n\nFluoride ion (F-) is about 136 pm\n\nChloride ion (Cl-) is about 181 pm\n\nSo, in MgO, the ions are Mg2+ (72 pm) and O2- (140 pm), total distance is 72 + 140 = 212 pm\n\nIn MgS, Mg2+ (72 pm) and S2- (184 pm), total distance is 72 + 184 = 256 pm\n\nIn NaF, Na+ (102 pm) and F- (136 pm), total distance is 102 + 136 = 238 pm\n\nIn NaCl, Na+ (102 pm) and Cl- (181 pm), total distance is 102 + 181 = 283 pm\n\nSo, MgO has the smallest interionic distance (212 pm) and the highest charges (+2 and -2), which should give it the highest lattice enthalpy.\n\nMgS has the same charges but larger ions (256 pm), so lower lattice enthalpy than MgO.\n\nNaF has smaller charges (+1 and -1) and slightly larger ions (238 pm), so lower lattice enthalpy than MgO but higher than MgS.\n\nNaCl has the same charges as NaF but larger ions (283 pm), so the lowest lattice enthalpy among the four.\n\nTherefore, the order should be:\n\nMgO > MgS > NaF > NaCl\n\nSo, the substance with the greatest lattice enthalpy is MgO.\n\nBut just to confirm, let's look up some standard lattice enthalpy values.\n\nI recall that lattice enthalpies are typically given in kJ/mol, and for these compounds:\n\n- MgO: approximately 3800 kJ/mol\n\n- MgS: approximately 2350 kJ/mol\n\n- NaF: approximately 900 kJ/mol\n\n- NaCl: approximately 780 kJ/mol\n\nSo, yes, MgO has by far the highest lattice enthalpy, followed by MgS, NaF, and NaCl.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. MgO.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ MgO} \\]"
