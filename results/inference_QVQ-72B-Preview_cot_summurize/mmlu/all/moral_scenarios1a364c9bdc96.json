                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I let my dog hump all the dogs in the dog park.\" Okay, so this is about dogs engaging in mating behavior at a dog park. Now, dog parks are places where owners can let their pets play and socialize off-leash. Dogs often engage in humping as part of their natural behavior, especially if they're not neutered or spayed. But in a dog park setting, there might be rules or expectations about such behaviors, especially if there are multiple dogs and owners present.\n\nI need to consider whether allowing my dog to hump other dogs is morally wrong. One thing to consider is whether the other dogs consent or if their owners consent. If the other dogs are comfortable and their owners don't mind, then it might not be a big deal. However, if it causes distress to other dogs or owners, that could be a problem.\n\nAlso, from a moral standpoint, animals have different standards than humans regarding sexual behavior. Dogs don't have the same concepts of morality or consent that humans do. So, unless there's harm or distress caused to the animals or others, it might not be considered morally wrong.\n\nBut, in human society, there might be cultural norms or rules about allowing dogs to engage in mating behaviors in public spaces like dog parks. Some dog parks might have rules against allowing dogs to mate, especially if it could lead to fights or the spread of diseases.\n\nSo, if I'm letting my dog hump other dogs in a dog park where such behavior is against the rules or causes distress to others, that could be seen as morally wrong because I'm not considering the rules of the place or the well-being of other dogs and their owners.\n\nOn the other hand, if the dog park allows such behavior and all parties involved are fine with it, then it might not be morally wrong.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"I put my son's dishes in the dishwasher and started it.\" This seems pretty straightforward. Dishwashers are appliances designed to clean dishes, right? So, putting dishes in the dishwasher is a normal household chore. The fact that they're my son's dishes doesn't change much unless there's something specific about them that makes it different.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the son is young and wasn't supposed to have those dishes yet, or perhaps there's some significance to them. But the description doesn't specify anything unusual about the dishes; it just says \"my son's dishes.\"\n\nFrom an ordinary moral standpoint in the US, cleaning someone's dishes without their permission might be seen as intrusive or disrespectful if they had plans for those dishes or if there's some sentimental value. But generally, cleaning dishes is not considered morally wrong.\n\nUnless there's some context missing here, like the son didn't want his dishes washed yet because he was still using them or something like that, but the scenario doesn't provide that information.\n\nSo, based on the information given, putting my son's dishes in the dishwasher and starting it doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Allowing my dog to hump other dogs in a dog park might or might not be morally wrong, depending on the context (rules of the park, consent of other owners, etc.).\n\n- Scenario 2: Washing my son's dishes in the dishwasher seems morally acceptable unless there's additional context that makes it otherwise.\n\nGiven that, the answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong, but wait, in scenario 1, it's possible that it's not wrong if the context allows it. However, since the question specifies \"ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020,\" and without specific context, it's hard to judge scenario 1 definitively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that in scenario 1, allowing dogs to engage in mating behavior in a public space like a dog park is considered morally wrong due to potential disturbances or rule violations.\n\nBut in scenario 2, washing dishes is generally not considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, if I had to choose between the options, I'd go with B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait, but the first scenario might not necessarily be wrong, depending on the context. Maybe in some places, it's acceptable, while in others, it's not.\n\nBut since the question specifies \"according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020,\" and without specific context, perhaps it's safer to assume that allowing dogs to engage in mating behavior in a dog park is considered morally wrong because it could be seen as disruptive or against park rules.\n\nWhereas washing dishes is a routine household chore and not morally laden unless there's something specific making it so.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
