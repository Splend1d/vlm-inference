                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that \\((2x + 3y)^2 = 4\\) and \\(xy = -5\\), and I need to find the value of \\(4x^2 + 9y^2\\). Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that \\((2x + 3y)^2 = 4\\). Maybe I can expand the left side and see if that helps. So, let's expand it:\n\n\\[(2x + 3y)^2 = 4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 = 4\\]\\\n\nOkay, so now I have \\(4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 = 4\\). And I need to find \\(4x^2 + 9y^2\\). If I can express \\(4x^2 + 9y^2\\) in terms of something I already know, that would be great.\n\nI notice that \\(4x^2 + 9y^2\\) is part of the expanded form, but there's this extra \\(12xy\\) term in there. Maybe I can isolate \\(4x^2 + 9y^2\\) by subtracting out the \\(12xy\\). So, if I subtract \\(12xy\\) from both sides of the equation, I get:\n\n\\[4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 - 12xy = 4 - 12xy\\]\\\n\nSimplifying that, it becomes:\n\n\\[4x^2 + 9y^2 = 4 - 12xy\\]\\\n\nAh, that's interesting. So now, if I can find the value of \\(xy\\), I can plug it into this equation to find \\(4x^2 + 9y2\\). And luckily, the problem tells me that \\(xy = -5\\). Perfect!\n\nSo, substituting \\(xy = -5\\) into the equation:\n\n\\[4x^2 + 9y^2 = 4 - 12(-5)\\]\\\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\[4 - 12(-5) = 4 + 60 = 64\\]\\\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, according to this, \\(4x^2 + 9y^2 = 64\\). But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the identity for \\((2x + 3y)^2\\), which is \\(4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2\\), as I already used. Or perhaps I can think about expressing \\(4x^2 + 9y^2\\) in terms of \\((2x + 3y)^2\\) and \\(xy\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about solving for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) first and then plugging them back in to find \\(4x^2 + 9y^2\\). But that might be more complicated, and since I already have a straightforward path, I'll stick with that.\n\nLet me just verify if there are any constraints or if I need to consider any special cases. The problem gives me two equations and asks for a specific expression, so I think my approach is valid.\n\nSo, the answer should be 64, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{64} \\]"
