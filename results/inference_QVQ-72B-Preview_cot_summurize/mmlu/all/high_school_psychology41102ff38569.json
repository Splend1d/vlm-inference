                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what condition Daniel might have based on the description. He's a toddler who's behind in speech development, avoids eye contact with people, and resists changes to his routine. The options are Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, mental retardation, and autism.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand each of these conditions a bit better. Starting with Down syndrome, I know that it's a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra chromosome. People with Down syndrome often have distinct facial features, like slanted eyes and a flat nasal bridge, and they might have intellectual disabilities. But the description doesn't mention anything about Daniel's appearance, so maybe that's not the best clue here.\n\nNext is fetal alcohol syndrome. I think this happens when a mother drinks alcohol during pregnancy, which can affect the baby's development. Symptoms can include growth problems, facial abnormalities, and intellectual disabilities. Again, the description doesn't mention any physical traits, so maybe this isn't the right fit for Daniel's behavior.\n\nThen there's mental retardation, which is now more commonly referred to as intellectual disability. This is a general term that describes limited intellectual functioning and difficulties with daily living skills. It can have various causes, including genetic conditions, infections, or injuries. The key here is that it affects learning and problem-solving abilities. Daniel seems to have some delays, especially in speech, but intellectual disability is a broad category and might not capture the specific behaviors mentioned.\n\nLastly, there's autism, which is actually autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This is a developmental disorder that affects communication, social interaction, and behavior. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and often include difficulties with verbal and nonverbal communication, repetitive behaviors or interests, and challenges with social interactions. One of the key signs is avoiding eye contact, which is mentioned in Daniel's description.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. Daniel is behind in speech development, which could be a sign of several conditions, including ASD. Avoiding eye contact is a common characteristic of ASD, as is resistance to changes in routine. These symptoms seem to align pretty closely with the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if these symptoms could also fit with the other conditions. Down syndrome can include speech delays, but again, the physical characteristics aren't mentioned, and avoiding eye contact isn't typically a primary symptom of Down syndrome. Similarly, fetal alcohol syndrome might cause speech delays and some behavioral issues, but avoiding eye contact and resisting changes in routine aren't primary features of that syndrome.\n\nMental retardation, or intellectual disability, can include speech delays and difficulty with social interactions, but again, the specific behaviors like avoiding eye contact and resisting changes in routine are more specifically associated with ASD.\n\nI should also consider that these symptoms could be indicative of other conditions or that they might be present in combination with other factors. However, based on the information provided and the options given, ASD seems to be the most fitting diagnosis.\n\nIt's important to remember that a proper diagnosis would require evaluation by a qualified healthcare provider, as symptoms can overlap between different conditions. But based on the description provided, autism spectrum disorder appears to be the most likely diagnosis for Daniel.\n\nSo, my answer would be D. autism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
