                    "text": "So I need to figure out the morphology of a togavirus. The options are:\n\nA. Enveloped spherical particles with an icosahedral structure\n\nB. Non-enveloped with an icosahedral structure\n\nC. Filamentous virus with protruding glycoproteins\n\nD. Small round viruses\n\nFirst, I should recall what a togavirus is. I think togaviruses are a family of viruses, and I believe they're RNA viruses. But I'm a bit fuzzy on their specific characteristics.\n\nLet me start by looking up some information about togaviruses. Maybe I can find a definition or a description of their structure.\n\nOkay, so after a quick search, I find that togaviruses are indeed a family of viruses, and they're part of the order Togavirales. They're positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. But what does their structure look like?\n\nI come across a description that says togaviruses are enveloped viruses with an icosahedral capsid. That sounds like option A. But let me make sure.\n\nOption A says \"enveloped spherical particles with an icosahedral structure.\" That seems to match. Option B is \"non-enveloped with an icosahedral structure,\" which would be different.\n\nOption C is \"filamentous virus with protruding glycoproteins.\" Filamentous means they're rod-shaped or thread-like, which I don't think applies to togaviruses.\n\nOption D is \"small round viruses.\" This is vague, but since togaviruses are specifically enveloped with an icosahedral capsid, I think A is more precise.\n\nWait, but I should confirm whether togaviruses are enveloped or not. From what I recall, many RNA viruses are enveloped, and togaviruses are no exception. Yes, they have an envelope derived from the host cell membrane.\n\nAlso, the capsid is icosahedral, which is a common structure for many viruses, providing a stable protective shell for the genetic material.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems correct. But just to be thorough, I'll check another source.\n\nLet me look up the morphology of togaviruses in a textbook or a reliable online resource. Ah, here's a microbiology textbook online.\n\nIt describes togaviruses as having a lipid envelope surrounding an icosahedral capsid. The capsid encloses the single-stranded RNA genome. So, this confirms my earlier understanding.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Enveloped spherical particles with an icosahedral structure.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check if there's any possibility that option D could also be correct. \"Small round viruses\" could be a general description for many viruses, including some that are enveloped and others that are not. However, since togaviruses are specifically enveloped with an icosahedral capsid, option A is more accurate and specific.\n\nOption B, non-enveloped with an icosahedral structure, doesn't fit because togaviruses are enveloped.\n\nOption C, filamentous virus with protruding glycoproteins, describes viruses that are elongated and have spike-like projections, which isn't the case for togaviruses.\n\nSo, after double-checking, I'm confident that option A is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
