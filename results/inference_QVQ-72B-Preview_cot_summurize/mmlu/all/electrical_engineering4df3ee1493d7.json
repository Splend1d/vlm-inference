                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this problem about a single-phase one-pulse controlled circuit with a resistance R and a counter emf E load. The source voltage is given as 400 sin(314 t), and the counter emf is 200 V. I need to find the range of the firing angle control, and the options are from 30\u00b0 to 150\u00b0, 30\u00b0 to 180\u00b0, 60\u00b0 to 120\u00b0, or 60\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how a single-phase one-pulse controlled circuit works. I think it's a thyristor-controlled rectifier (TCR) or something similar, where the firing angle determines when the thyristor turns on during each cycle, thus controlling the output voltage.\n\nGiven that there's a counter emf (E) of 200 V, which is probably opposing the source voltage, I need to consider how this affects the firing angle range.\n\nThe source voltage is 400 sin(314 t), which is a sinusoidal voltage with an amplitude of 400 V and an angular frequency of 314 rad/s. The counter emf is given as E = 200 V.\n\nI need to find the range of the firing angle \u03b1 where the circuit can operate properly. I recall that in a controlled rectifier, the firing angle can range from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0, but the presence of the counter emf might restrict this range.\n\nMaybe I need to find the minimum and maximum firing angles that allow the thyristor to conduct properly. Perhaps there's a minimum voltage difference required between the source and the counter emf for the thyristor to turn on.\n\nLet me think about the instantaneous voltage across the thyristor. The voltage across the thyristor is the source voltage minus the counter emf, so V_thyristor = 400 sin(314 t) - 200 V.\n\nThe thyristor will turn on when this voltage becomes positive, provided that the firing pulse is applied at the desired firing angle \u03b1.\n\nWait, but in reality, the thyristor can only turn on after the firing pulse is applied, and the voltage must be positive at that instant for it to conduct.\n\nSo, I need to find the range of \u03b1 where V_thyristor > 0 at \u03b1.\n\nThat is, 400 sin(314 \u03b1) - 200 > 0.\n\nLet's solve for \u03b1:\n\n400 sin(314 \u03b1) - 200 > 0\n\n400 sin(314 \u03b1) > 200\n\nsin(314 \u03b1) > 200 / 400\n\nsin(314 \u03b1) > 0.5\n\nNow, I need to find the range of \u03b1 for which sin(314 \u03b1) > 0.5.\n\nFirst, find the angles where sin(314 \u03b1) = 0.5.\n\nSo, 314 \u03b1 = arcsin(0.5)\n\n\u03b1 = arcsin(0.5) / 314\n\narcsin(0.5) is 30\u00b0 or \u03c0/6 radians.\n\nSo, 314 \u03b1 = \u03c0/6\n\n\u03b1 = (\u03c0/6) / 314\n\nBut wait, 314 rad/s is the angular frequency, which is \u03c9 = 2\u03c0 f, and assuming f = 50 Hz, since \u03c9 = 314 rad/s.\n\nSo, \u03c9 = 314 rad/s = 2\u03c0 * 50 Hz.\n\nTherefore, the period T = 1 / f = 0.02 seconds.\n\nNow, to find \u03b1 in degrees, I need to remember that the angular position in radians is \u03c9 \u03b1.\n\nWait, perhaps I should work in radians for consistency.\n\nLet me convert everything to radians.\n\nGiven that \u03c9 = 314 rad/s, and I need to find \u03b1 in radians.\n\nThe condition is sin(\u03c9 \u03b1) > 0.5\n\nSo, \u03c9 \u03b1 = arcsin(0.5) + 2\u03c0 n, or \u03c0 - arcsin(0.5) + 2\u03c0 n, for n an integer.\n\narcsin(0.5) = \u03c0/6\n\nSo, \u03c9 \u03b1 = \u03c0/6 + 2\u03c0 n, or \u03c0 - \u03c0/6 + 2\u03c0 n = 5\u03c0/6 + 2\u03c0 n\n\nSince we're dealing with one cycle, we can consider n = 0.\n\nThus, \u03c9 \u03b1 = \u03c0/6 or 5\u03c0/6\n\nTherefore, \u03b1 = (\u03c0/6)/\u03c9 or (5\u03c0/6)/\u03c9\n\nGiven \u03c9 = 314 rad/s, then \u03b1 = \u03c0/(6*314) or 5\u03c0/(6*314)\n\nBut this seems too small, probably because I'm confusing units.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider \u03b1 in terms of electrical degrees.\n\nGiven \u03c9 = 314 rad/s, and assuming f = 50 Hz, then the period T = 1/f = 0.02 s.\n\nIn one cycle, there are 2\u03c0 radians or 360\u00b0.\n\nSo, to convert radians to degrees: 1 radian = 180/\u03c0 degrees.\n\nSo, \u03c0/6 radians = 30\u00b0, and 5\u03c0/6 radians = 150\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, the firing angle \u03b1 should be between 30\u00b0 and 150\u00b0 to ensure that sin(\u03c9 \u03b1) > 0.5, which corresponds to option A.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAt \u03b1 = 30\u00b0, sin(314 * 30\u00b0 / 180\u00b0) = sin(\u03c0/6) = 0.5\n\nAt \u03b1 = 150\u00b0, sin(314 * 150\u00b0 / 180\u00b0) = sin(5\u03c0/6) = 0.5\n\nBetween these points, sin(\u03c9 \u03b1) > 0.5.\n\nSo, the range is from 30\u00b0 to 150\u00b0.\n\nBut wait, the counter emf is 200 V, and the source voltage is 400 sin(314 t).\n\nSo, the net voltage is 400 sin(314 t) - 200.\n\nThis net voltage needs to be positive for the thyristor to conduct.\n\nSo, 400 sin(314 t) - 200 > 0 \u21d2 sin(314 t) > 0.5\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nTherefore, the firing angle \u03b1 should be within the range where sin(\u03c9 \u03b1) > 0.5, which is between 30\u00b0 and 150\u00b0.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 30\u00b0 to 150\u00b0.\n\nBut let me consider if there are any other factors that might affect this range, such as the resistance R.\n\nIn the problem, it mentions \"resistance R and counter emf E load\", but since we're dealing with the firing angle control based on the voltage conditions, and assuming R is just a resistive load, it shouldn't affect the firing angle range directly.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A. 30\u00b0 to 150\u00b0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 30^\\circ \\text{ to } 150^\\circ} \\]"
