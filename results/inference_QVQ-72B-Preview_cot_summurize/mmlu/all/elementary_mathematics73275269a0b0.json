                    "text": "So I have this expression to evaluate: 14 + (\u221271). I need to find out which of these options it equals: A. \u221285, B. 57, C. 85, or D. \u221257.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what adding a negative number means. Adding a negative number is the same as subtracting the positive value of that number. So, 14 + (\u221271) should be the same as 14 minus 71.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n14 + (\u221271) = 14 \u2212 71\n\nNow, I need to subtract 71 from 14. Let me think about this. 14 is less than 71, so when I subtract a larger number from a smaller one, the result is negative. For example, 14 \u2212 71 is like saying 14 minus 71, which is the same as negative (71 minus 14).\n\nSo, 14 \u2212 71 = \u2212(71 \u2212 14) = \u221257\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Maybe I can use a number line to visualize this.\n\nLet's see, starting at 14 on the number line. Adding negative 71 would mean moving 71 units to the left from 14. Since 14 minus 71 would take me past zero into the negative region, ending up at \u221257.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 14 plus how much more to get to 71. But since it's addition of a negative, it's actually subtraction.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the concept of absolute values. The absolute difference between 14 and 71 is 57. Since I'm subtracting a larger number from a smaller one, the result is negative, so \u221257.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other approach that could lead to a different answer, just to be sure.\n\nMaybe using the properties of addition and subtraction:\n\n14 + (\u221271) = 14 \u2212 71\n\nAlternatively, I could add 14 and \u221271 directly, which should give the same result.\n\n14 + (\u221271) = \u221257\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, using the fact that addition is commutative:\n\n(\u221271) + 14 = \u2212(71 \u2212 14) = \u221257\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think I'm consistent in getting \u221257 as the answer.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nA. \u221285\n\nB. 57\n\nC. 85\n\nD. \u221257\n\nSo, \u221257 is option D.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any trick here. Is there any possibility that the expression could be interpreted differently?\n\nNo, I think it's straightforward. It's simply adding a negative number to a positive one, which is equivalent to subtracting the positive number.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider the algebraic rules for addition and subtraction:\n\n- When adding two positive numbers, the result is positive.\n\n- When adding two negative numbers, the result is negative.\n\n- When adding a positive and a negative number, it's like subtracting the absolute values, and the sign depends on which one is larger.\n\nIn this case, 14 is positive, and \u221271 is negative. So, adding them together is like subtracting, and since 71 is larger than 14, the result is negative.\n\nI think I've covered all possible ways to approach this, and each time I end up with \u221257.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. \u221257.\n\nJust to make sure, let me perform the operation again step by step:\n\n1. 14 + (\u221271) = 14 \u2212 71\n\n2. 14 \u2212 71 = \u2212(71 \u2212 14) = \u221257\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI don't think there's any other way this could be interpreted. So, I'm confident that the answer is D. \u221257.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ -57} \\]"
