                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about independent events. It says that events A and B each have a nonzero probability, and they're independent. And I need to figure out which statement is true from the options given. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that when two events are independent, the occurrence of one doesn't affect the occurrence of the other. So, in probability terms, P(A|B) = P(A), and similarly, P(B|A) = P(B). That's the definition of independence, right?\n\nOption A says that P(A and B) = P(A) \u00b7 P(B). I remember that this is another way to define independence between two events. So, if P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) * P(B), then A and B are independent. So, this seems to be true. But let me double-check.\n\nOption B says that A and B may or may not be mutually exclusive. Mutually exclusive means that if A happens, B can't happen, and vice versa. So, P(A \u2229 B) = 0. But if A and B are independent, then P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) * P(B), which is nonzero since both A and B have nonzero probabilities. So, that means A and B cannot be mutually exclusive if they're independent. So, option B seems to be saying that they may or may not be mutually exclusive, but based on what I just thought, they cannot be mutually exclusive if they're independent. So, option B might be false.\n\nOption C says that A and B must be mutually exclusive. But that can't be right because, as I just thought, if they're independent, P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) * P(B), which is not zero unless one of them has zero probability, which isn't the case here. So, they can't be mutually exclusive. So, option C is false.\n\nOption D says that P(A| B) = P(B| A). Hmm, well, I know that P(A| B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B), and P(B| A) = P(B \u2229 A) / P(A). Since P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) * P(B) for independent events, then P(A| B) = P(A), and P(B| A) = P(B). So, P(A| B) = P(A), and P(B| A) = P(B), but unless P(A) = P(B), which isn't specified, this isn't necessarily true. So, option D is probably false.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option A is the correct one. Let me just make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any other way to interpret these options. For example, maybe there's a case where A and B are independent and also mutually exclusive, but as I thought earlier, that's not possible if both have nonzero probabilities. So, options B and C seem clearly false.\n\nOption D, P(A| B) = P(B| A), for independent events, as I calculated, is P(A) and P(B), respectively. So, unless P(A) = P(B), which isn't stated, this isn't generally true. So, I think option D is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is option A: P(A and B) = P(A) \u00b7 P(B). That's the fundamental property of independent events.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should think about an example. Suppose I have two fair coins, each coin representing an event. Let's say event A is getting heads on the first coin, and event B is getting heads on the second coin. Both events have P(A) = P(B) = 0.5. They are independent because flipping one coin doesn't affect the other.\n\nAccording to option A, P(A and B) should be P(A) * P(B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. And indeed, the probability of both coins landing heads is 0.25. So, that checks out.\n\nFor mutual exclusivity, P(A \u2229 B) = 0, but in this case, it's 0.25, which is not zero, so they're not mutually exclusive, which aligns with the fact that independent events aren't mutually exclusive unless one has zero probability.\n\nOption D suggests P(A| B) = P(B| A), which in this case would be P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, so only if P(A) = P(B), which isn't necessarily the case in general, though it is in this example. But since the problem doesn't specify that P(A) = P(B), I can't assume that.\n\nTherefore, the only true statement is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
