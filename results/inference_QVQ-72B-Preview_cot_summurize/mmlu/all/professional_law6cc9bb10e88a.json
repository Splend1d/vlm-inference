                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario here where a buyer gets an item from a merchant, and it turns out to be unfit, defective, and unsafe for its ordinary purposes. The question is asking which of the following can be invoked by the buyer: express warranty, implied warranty, warranty of title, or warranty of merchantability.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what each of these warranties means.\n\nStarting with an express warranty: this is something where the seller explicitly assures certain qualities or conditions about the product. Like, if a salesperson says the product will do X, Y, and Z, or if there's advertising that claims certain things about the product, that's an express warranty.\n\nNext, an implied warranty is a bit different. This is not explicitly stated by the seller but is understood or assumed based on the nature of the transaction. There are a couple of types of implied warranties, but the two main ones are the warranty of merchantability and the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.\n\nThe warranty of title is about the seller's right to sell the item. It guarantees that the seller is the rightful owner and that there are no liens or claims against the item. So, it's more about the legal status of the item rather than its quality or condition.\n\nNow, the warranty of merchantability is specifically about the quality and functionality of the item. It ensures that the item is fit for the ordinary purposes for which such items are used. So, if you buy a toaster, it should toast bread properly.\n\nIn this scenario, the item is described as unfit, defective, and unsafe for its ordinary purposes. Assuming no other warranties are mentioned, I need to see which of these warranties would cover this situation.\n\nLet's eliminate the ones that don't directly relate to the condition of the item.\n\nExpress warranty would only apply if the seller had made specific promises about the item's quality or performance, which isn't stated in the scenario. So, unless there was some express assurance, this might not be applicable here.\n\nImplied warranty is a bit broader, but it includes the warranty of merchantability, which specifically deals with the item's fitness for ordinary use.\n\nThe warranty of title is about the seller's right to sell the item, not about the item's condition, so that seems unrelated to this situation.\n\nSo, between the options given, the warranty of merchantability seems the most directly applicable here because it concerns the item's fitness for its ordinary purposes, which is exactly what's at issue in this scenario\u2014the item is unfit, defective, and unsafe for its ordinary purposes.\n\nBut, just to make sure, let's think about whether there could be an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose here. That warranty applies when the seller knows or has reason to know about the buyer's particular purpose for the item and the buyer relies on the seller's skill or judgment to select suitable goods. In this case, the problem doesn't specify any particular purpose beyond ordinary use, so it's likely that the implied warranty of merchantability is the more relevant one here.\n\nTherefore, the buyer can invoke the warranty of merchantability in this situation.\n\nWait a minute, but the option also includes \"implied warranty.\" That's a bit vague because implied warranty could include both merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Since the scenario specifies \"for its ordinary purposes,\" it's more precisely covered by the warranty of merchantability.\n\nSo, to be precise, the best answer is D. Warranty of merchantability.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if there's any possibility of invoking another warranty.\n\nExpress warranty: no, unless there was an explicit assurance, which isn't mentioned.\n\nImplied warranty: yes, but it's too broad and includes multiple types.\n\nWarranty of title: not relevant here.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. Warranty of merchantability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
