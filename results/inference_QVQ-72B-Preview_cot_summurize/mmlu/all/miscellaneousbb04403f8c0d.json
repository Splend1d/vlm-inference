Tinky Winky. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these characters is called 'Da Niao' in China.\n\nFirst off, I know that 'Da Niao' is Chinese, and it literally translates to 'Big Bird' in English. So, that might be a clue. Let me think about each character one by one.\n\nStarting with Barney. Barney is a purple dinosaur, right? He's from the show \"Barney & Friends.\" I don't recall Barney being referred to as 'Da Niao' in China. In fact, I think Barney has his own name in Chinese translations of the show. Maybe not directly as 'Da Niao.'\n\nNext is Big Bird. Big Bird is from \"Sesame Street,\" which is an American children's television series. I know that \"Sesame Street\" has been translated into many languages and cultures, including China. In Chinese, Big Bird is indeed known as \"\u5927\u9e1f\" (Da Niao). That seems like a perfect match.\n\nThen there's Mickey Mouse. Mickey Mouse is a classic Disney character. I believe his name in Chinese is \u7c73\u5947 (Mi Qi), not 'Da Niao.' So, probably not him.\n\nLastly, Tinky Winky. Tinky Winky is from \"Teletubbies,\" another popular children's show. I don't remember his name being 'Da Niao' in Chinese. Each Teletubby has their own name, and I think they have corresponding names in Chinese, but again, not 'Da Niao.'\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like Big Bird is the character known as 'Da Niao' in China. Let me just double-check this information to be sure.\n\nI recall that \"Sesame Street\" has a Chinese version called \"\u829d\u9ebb\u8857\" (Zhi Ma Jie), and in that adaptation, the characters have Chinese names. Big Bird is indeed referred to as \"\u5927\u9e1f\" (Da Niao), which means 'Big Bird' in English. This makes sense because Big Bird is a large, yellow bird, and 'Da Niao' is a fitting translation for his character.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll consider if there's any other character from these options that might also be known as 'Da Niao.' Barney is a dinosaur, not a bird; Mickey Mouse is a mouse; and Tinky Winky is a Teletubby, none of which are birds. So, no, I don't think any of them would be called 'Da Niao.'\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Big Bird.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Big Bird}} \\]"
