                    "text": "Let's see. I need to find out which proposition is the strongest refutation of Bentham's felicific calculus. First, I should probably understand what the felicific calculus is. I remember that Bentham was a utilitarian philosopher, and the felicific calculus is a method he proposed to measure the amount of pleasure or happiness that an action would produce. It's like a way to calculate whether an action is good or bad based on how much happiness it brings about.\n\nSo, the felicific calculus is all about maximizing happiness and minimizing pain or suffering. It considers factors like intensity, duration, certainty, proximity, fecundity, and purity of pleasure or pain.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Happiness is less important than economic prosperity.\n\nThis seems to suggest that economic well-being should be prioritized over happiness. But in utilitarianism, happiness is the ultimate good, and economic prosperity is likely seen as a means to achieve happiness. So, if someone argues that economic prosperity is more important than happiness, that would be contradicting utilitarian principles. But is this the strongest refutation of the felicific calculus?\n\nB. It is impossible to calculate all the consequences of one's acts.\n\nThis seems crucial because the felicific calculus relies on being able to predict and measure the consequences of actions in terms of pleasure and pain. If it's impossible to calculate all the consequences, then the calculus wouldn't work as intended. This challenges the practicality and reliability of the felicific calculus.\n\nC. Pain and pleasure are inevitable features of life.\n\nThis statement acknowledges that pain and pleasure are part of life, which might not necessarily refute the felicific calculus. Utilitarians would agree that both exist but would aim to maximize pleasure over pain. So, this seems more like an acceptance of the utilitarian premise rather than a refutation.\n\nD. Utilitarianism fails to take account of differences in social background.\n\nThis points out a potential shortcoming of utilitarianism, suggesting that it doesn't consider individual circumstances or social inequalities. While this is a valid criticism of utilitarianism, it doesn't directly refute the felicific calculus itself, which is a tool for measuring pleasure and pain, not for addressing social injustices.\n\nSo, comparing these options, B seems to be the most direct challenge to the felicific calculus. If we can't calculate all the consequences of our actions, then the whole idea of the calculus falls apart. It's like the foundation is shaky, and without that ability to predict and measure consequences accurately, the calculus can't function effectively.\n\nOption A is more about prioritizing economics over happiness, which is against utilitarianism's core principle, but it doesn't directly refute the calculus itself. Option C is more aligned with utilitarianism, and option D criticizes utilitarianism for not considering social backgrounds, but again, that's more about the application of utilitarianism rather than the calculus itself.\n\nTherefore, the most powerful refutation of Bentham's felicific calculus is option B: It is impossible to calculate all the consequences of one's acts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
