                    "text": " So I have this question about prenatal development in humans. It's asking which term refers to a stage that starts around the second week of pregnancy and goes until about the eighth week. The options are fertilization, fetal stage, embryonic stage, and viability. Hmm, I need to recall the stages of prenatal development to answer this correctly.\n\nFirst, I know that prenatal development happens in several stages. It starts with fertilization, which is when the sperm and egg combine to form a zygote. That's like the first moment of conception. But the question is asking about a stage that begins at roughly the second week of pregnancy. So fertilization happens before that, right? Maybe fertilization isn't the right answer here.\n\nNext, there's the embryonic stage. I think this is the period when the zygote develops into an embryo. Let me try to remember the timeline. Fertilization occurs at week 0, and then the zygote divides and implants in the uterus around the sixth to tenth day after fertilization. So, implantation is around the first week of pregnancy. Then, the embryonic stage starts after implantation. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again.\n\nActually, I think the embryonic stage begins after fertilization and lasts until about the eighth week of pregnancy. Yeah, that sounds familiar. During this time, the embryo develops from a single cell into a more complex structure with various organs starting to form. So, according to that, the embryonic stage begins at week 1, which is roughly the second week after fertilization, since pregnancy is typically dated from the first day of the last menstrual period. So, if fertilization is at week 0, and pregnancy is counted from week 1, that would make the embryonic stage starting at week 1 and lasting until week 8.\n\nLet me confirm that. In human prenatal development, the embryonic period is from the third week to the eighth week after the last menstrual period. Since fertilization occurs roughly two weeks after the last menstrual period, that would align with starting at the second week post-fertilization and lasting until the eighth week post-fertilization. So, that seems to match the description in the question.\n\nNow, what about the other options? The fetal stage comes after the embryonic stage. I think it starts from the ninth week of pregnancy and continues until birth. So, that's not the period being described in the question.\n\nViability refers to the point when the fetus can survive outside the womb, which is generally around the 24th week of pregnancy. So, that's well after the period mentioned in the question.\n\nFertilization, as I thought earlier, is the initial event where the sperm and egg combine, which occurs before the embryonic stage begins.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the correct answer should be the embryonic stage.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any chance that the question is referring to the embryonic stage differently? Maybe I should look up a quick reference to confirm.\n\nAlright, I recall that in embryology, the embryonic period is when most major organs and systems begin to develop. It's a critical time for development and is when the risk of congenital anomalies is highest due to the rapid cell division and differentiation.\n\nMoreover, the embryonic stage is indeed from the third to the eighth week after the last menstrual period, which corresponds to the second to the sixth week after fertilization, since pregnancy is dated from the last menstrual period.\n\nGiven that, the question specifies \"at roughly the second week of pregnancy and lasts until roughly the eighth week.\" That aligns perfectly with the embryonic stage.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. embryonic stage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
