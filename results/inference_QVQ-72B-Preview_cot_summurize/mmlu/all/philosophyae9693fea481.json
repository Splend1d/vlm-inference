                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this concept of a prima facie duty. It's a term from ethics, right? I think it was introduced by W.D. Ross. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it.\n\nFirst off, \"prima facie\" is a Latin phrase that means \"at first glance\" or \"on the face of it.\" So, a prima facie duty should be something that appears to be a duty at first blush, but maybe it's not absolutely certain or there could be exceptions.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Seems to be right, although this might be illusory.\n\nB. Tends to be right, although this might be outweighed by other considerations.\n\nC. Is right.\n\nD. Is the first thing that an agent ought to do, above all else.\n\nOption C says it's just right, full stop. But that seems too strong for a prima facie duty. If something is simply right, without any qualifications, that sounds more like an absolute duty, not a prima facie one.\n\nOption D suggests it's the top priority, above all else. That also sounds like an absolute duty. Prima facie duties aren't supposed to be absolute; they can be overridden by other considerations.\n\nOption A says it seems to be right but might be illusory. That makes it sound like it might not actually be a duty at all, just an appearance. But I think prima facie duties are more than just appearances; they're real duties, just not necessarily the only ones that apply in a situation.\n\nOption B says it tends to be right but can be outweighed by other considerations. This seems to align better with my understanding of prima facie duties. They're duties that generally ought to be followed, but in certain situations, other duties might take precedence.\n\nLet me think about an example. Suppose I promise to meet a friend for lunch, but on the day, an emergency comes up at work that requires my immediate attention. In this case, keeping my promise to my friend is a prima facie duty because generally, keeping promises is something I ought to do. However, the emergency at work might be a stronger consideration that overrides my duty to keep the promise.\n\nSo, in this scenario, my prima facie duty to keep my promise is outweighed by the more pressing duty to address the emergency at work.\n\nTherefore, a prima facie duty is one that appears to be right and is generally right, but can be overridden by stronger considerations in specific situations.\n\nGoing back to the options, B seems to capture this idea perfectly. It's not just seeming right but tending to be right, acknowledging that other considerations can outweigh it.\n\nOption A, on the other hand, suggests that it might be entirely illusory, which doesn't seem to capture the nuanced idea of a prima facie duty being a real duty that can be overridden.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is B: tends to be right, although this might be outweighed by other considerations.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider another example. Imagine I have a prima facie duty to tell the truth. Generally, it's right to tell the truth. But suppose telling the truth would cause unnecessary harm to someone's feelings, and lying would prevent that harm without any negative consequences. In this case, the duty to prevent harm might outweigh the duty to tell the truth, making lying the more morally acceptable action.\n\nThis again illustrates that prima facie duties can be overridden by other, stronger duties or considerations.\n\nSo, in conclusion, a prima facie duty is one that tends to be right but can be outweighed by other considerations. Therefore, the best answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
