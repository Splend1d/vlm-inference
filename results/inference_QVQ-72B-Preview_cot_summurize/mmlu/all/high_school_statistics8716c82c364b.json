                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about heartworm testing in dogs. It says that the test shows a positive result in 96% of dogs that actually have heartworm, and a negative result in 98% of dogs that don't have heartworm. Also, heartworm occurs in 10% of dogs. I need to find the probability that a randomly selected dog that tested positive actually has heartworm.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a Bayes' theorem problem. I remember learning about conditional probability in statistics class. Let me try to rephrase this to make sure I understand.\n\nSo, I need to find the probability that a dog has heartworm given that the test is positive. Let's denote:\n\n- H: the dog has heartworm.\n\n- P: the test is positive.\n\nWe need to find P(H|P), which is the probability that the dog has heartworm given that the test is positive.\n\nFrom the problem, I know:\n\n- The test is positive in 96% of dogs that have heartworm. That means P(P|H) = 96% or 0.96.\n\n- The test is negative in 98% of dogs that don't have heartworm. So, P(N|H') = 98%, where H' means the dog does not have heartworm.\n\nAlso, heartworm occurs in 10% of dogs, so P(H) = 0.10.\n\nI think I need to use Bayes' formula, which is:\n\nP(H|P) = [P(P|H) * P(H)] / P(P)\n\nBut I need to find P(P), the probability that the test is positive, regardless of whether the dog has heartworm or not.\n\nI can find P(P) using the law of total probability:\n\nP(P) = P(P|H) * P(H) + P(P|H') * P(H')\n\nWhere P(H') is the probability that the dog does not have heartworm, which is 1 - P(H) = 0.90.\n\nWait, I have P(N|H') = 0.98, which is the probability of a negative test given no heartworm. So, P(P|H') would be the probability of a positive test given no heartworm, which is 1 - P(N|H') = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02.\n\nSo, P(P|H') = 0.02.\n\nNow, plugging into the formula:\n\nP(P) = P(P|H) * P(H) + P(P|H') * P(H') = 0.96 * 0.10 + 0.02 * 0.90 = 0.096 + 0.018 = 0.114.\n\nThen, P(H|P) = (0.96 * 0.10) / 0.114.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n0.96 * 0.10 = 0.096.\n\nDivide by 0.114: 0.096 / 0.114.\n\nLet's see, 0.096 divided by 0.114.\n\nFirst, I can multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to make it easier: 96 / 114.\n\nSimplify that fraction: both numerator and denominator can be divided by 6.\n\n96 \u00f7 6 = 16, and 114 \u00f7 6 = 19.\n\nSo, 16/19.\n\nNow, what's 16 divided by 19?\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n16 \u00f7 19 = 0.8421...\n\nSo, approximately 0.842, which is 84.2%.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 11%\n\nB. 18%\n\nC. 84%\n\nD. 88%\n\nSo, it's closest to C. 84%.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the calculations correctly.\n\nFirst, P(P|H') = 1 - P(N|H') = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02.\n\nThen, P(P) = (0.96 * 0.10) + (0.02 * 0.90) = 0.096 + 0.018 = 0.114.\n\nThen, P(H|P) = 0.096 / 0.114 = 16/19 \u2248 0.842 or 84.2%.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a tree diagram or a contingency table to visualize this.\n\nLet's assume there are 1000 dogs.\n\n- 100 have heartworm (10% of 1000).\n\n- 900 do not have heartworm.\n\nOf the 100 with heartworm, 96% test positive: 0.96 * 100 = 96 dogs.\n\nOf the 900 without heartworm, 2% test positive (since 98% test negative): 0.02 * 900 = 18 dogs.\n\nSo, total positive tests: 96 + 18 = 114 dogs.\n\nOut of these 114 dogs that test positive, 96 actually have heartworm.\n\nSo, P(H|P) = 96 / 114 = 16/19 \u2248 0.842, which is 84.2%.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 84%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
