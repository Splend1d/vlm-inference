                    "text": "So I have this question here about the Inca record-keeping system. It says that they used a series of knotted strings as mnemonic devices, and I need to choose what that's called from the options: cuneiform, rachis, mit'a, or khipu.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Inca civilization was in South America, specifically in what is now Peru, and they had a highly organized society with various systems to manage their empire. One of these systems was their way of keeping records, which didn't involve writing in the way we think of it, like with alphabets or characters. Instead, they used knots on strings.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Cuneiform: I remember this is a type of writing system that was used by several ancient Mesopotamian civilizations, like the Sumerians and Babylonians. It involves wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets. So, that's not related to knotted strings; it's a completely different method.\n\nB. Rachis: Hmm, I'm not too sure about this one. Rachis sounds like it might be related to botany or something else, but not specifically to Inca record-keeping. Maybe it's a distractor.\n\nC. Mit'a: I've heard of this term before in the context of the Inca. I think it refers to a system of mandatory public service or labor tax that people had to perform for the state. So, that's more about a social or economic system, not about record-keeping.\n\nD. Khipu: Now, this rings a bell. I think khipu is the name of the Inca system that used knotted strings to record information. It's often described as a kind of quipu, which is another way of spelling it, and it was used to keep track of various data, possibly including administrative records, census information, or even stories and histories.\n\nLet me double-check. I recall that the khipu consisted of a main cord with multiple strings hanging from it, and these strings had different types of knots along them. The position, type of knot, and color of the strings were all significant and could convey different kinds of information. Some scholars believe that the khipu was a sophisticated system that could represent numerical data as well as more complex information.\n\nGiven that, it seems clear that khipu is the correct answer for the Inca record-keeping system that used knotted strings.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if any of the other options could possibly be related.\n\nCuneiform is definitely out because it's a completely different writing system from a different part of the world.\n\nRachis doesn't seem to have any connection to Inca record-keeping based on what I know.\n\nMit'a is about labor service, not about how they kept records.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. khipu.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. khipu}} \\]"
