Hmm, I need to remember which type of cell is responsible for building bone.\n\nLet me think back to my biology classes. I recall that bones are living tissues and they're constantly being remodeled through the actions of certain cells. There are cells that build bone and others that break it down. The ones that build bone, I think they're called osteoblasts. Let me see if that's correct.\n\nOption A is osteoblasts. I've heard of that term before. Osteo- relates to bone, and -blast refers to a cell involved in formation or production. So, osteoblasts are cells that help form bone. That sounds right.\n\nOption B is osteoclasts. Again, osteo- relates to bone, and -clast suggests breaking or crushing. So, osteoclasts are likely the cells that break down bone. That doesn't match what the question is asking, which is about building bone.\n\nOption C is osteostructs. I'm not familiar with that term. Let me break it down. Osteo- again, relates to bone, and -struct might suggest structure. But I don't recall any cell called an osteostruct. Maybe it's a mis-spelling or a incorrect term.\n\nOption D is osteopori. That sounds similar to osteoporosis, which is a condition where bones become weak and brittle. But that's a disease, not a type of cell. So, that can't be the correct answer.\n\nSo, based on my knowledge, osteoblasts are the cells that build bone. Let me just double-check that.\n\nI remember that in bone tissue, osteoblasts are responsible for producing the matrix of bone, which is mostly made up of collagen and minerals like calcium and phosphate. They help in depositing these materials to form new bone tissue. On the other hand, osteoclasts are involved in resorbing or breaking down bone tissue, which is important for remodeling and maintaining bone health.\n\nSo, between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, osteoblasts are the ones that build bone. Therefore, the correct answer should be A. Osteoblasts.\n\nI think that's the right answer. I should make sure that I'm not confusing similar-sounding terms. Osteostructs and osteopori seem like they might be related to bone structure or conditions affecting bones, but they aren't the names of cells involved in building bone.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A. Osteoblasts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Osteoblasts}} \\]"
