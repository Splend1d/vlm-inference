                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about renewable energy investment in 2015. The question is asking which country invested the largest fraction of its GDP in renewable energy that year. The options are China, Japan, Chile, and India. Hmm, I need to find out which one of these countries dedicated the highest percentage of their GDP to renewable energy investments in 2015.\n\nFirst off, I should understand what \"fraction of GDP\" means in this context. GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is the total value of all goods and services produced by a country in a specific period. So, investing a fraction of GDP in renewable energy means using a part of the country's total economic output to fund renewable energy projects.\n\nNow, I need to find data from 2015 that shows how much each of these countries invested in renewable energy relative to their total GDP. This might involve looking for statistics on renewable energy investments and GDP figures for each country from that year.\n\nLet me start by recalling if I know any recent figures about renewable energy investments. I remember that China has been a major player in renewable energy investments, but I'm not sure about the exact figures for 2015.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to look up this information quickly. Maybe I can search for reports or databases that provide such data.\n\nI recall that the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Renewable Energy Policy Network (REN21) often publish reports on renewable energy investments. Maybe I can look for their 2015 reports.\n\nBut since I don't have access to those resources right now, perhaps I can think about the general trends in these countries during 2015.\n\nLet me consider each country one by one.\n\nStarting with China:\n\nChina is the world's largest energy consumer and has been making significant investments in renewable energy. I think they lead in terms of absolute investment amounts in renewables, but the question is about the fraction of GDP, not the total amount invested.\n\nGiven that China has a very large GDP, even a small percentage of it would amount to a huge absolute investment. So, even if their fraction is relatively small, the total investment could be large.\n\nNext, Japan:\n\nJapan is a technologically advanced country with a strong emphasis on innovation. After the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, Japan shifted its focus more towards renewable energy. They might have increased their investments in renewables post-2011, but I'm not sure about the exact figures for 2015.\n\nJapan's GDP is also quite large, so again, even a small percentage could represent a substantial investment.\n\nNow, Chile:\n\nChile is a smaller country compared to China, Japan, and India, but it has been making strides in renewable energy, particularly in solar and wind power. Chile has set ambitious renewable energy targets, and I believe they have a higher percentage of their energy mix coming from renewables.\n\nGiven that Chile's GDP is smaller than the others, a smaller absolute investment could represent a larger fraction of its GDP.\n\nLastly, India:\n\nIndia is a rapidly developing country with a growing energy demand. The Indian government has been promoting renewable energy, especially solar, through various initiatives like the National Solar Mission. India's GDP is smaller than China's or Japan's but larger than Chile's.\n\nAgain, while India might be investing a significant amount in renewables, the fraction relative to its GDP might not be as high as some other countries.\n\nConsidering all this, I'm still not sure which country has the highest fraction of GDP invested in renewable energy in 2015.\n\nMaybe I can try to find some data online or recall if there are any prominent reports that mention this specific metric.\n\nI recall that in 2015, there was a significant increase in global renewable energy investments, driven in part by countries like China and India, but also by smaller countries that are more committed to renewables.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the country that invests the highest fraction of its GDP in renewables is not necessarily the one with the largest economy, but rather one that prioritizes renewables in its budget allocations.\n\nThis makes sense because smaller economies might need to allocate a larger portion of their GDP to renewables to meet their energy needs or to mitigate environmental impacts.\n\nSo, perhaps Chile, being a smaller country, invests a larger fraction of its GDP in renewables compared to larger economies like China or India.\n\nLet me see if I can find any data to support this.\n\nI found that in 2015, Chile was making significant progress in renewable energy adoption. The country has abundant solar resources and has been attracting investments in solar power projects.\n\nMoreover, Chile's economy is smaller, so even if the absolute investment is less than that of China or India, the fraction of GDP could be higher.\n\nOn the other hand, China, despite its large investments in renewables, has an enormous GDP, which might dilute the percentage allocated to renewables.\n\nSimilarly, Japan has a high GDP and might not allocate as high a percentage to renewables as Chile does.\n\nIndia, while increasing its investments in renewables, still has a large portion of its economy allocated to other sectors, so the fraction might not be as high as Chile's.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, I would conclude that Chile invested the largest fraction of its GDP in renewable energy in 2015 among the given options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Chile}} \\]"
