                    "text": "So I have this question about whether selecting every twenty-fifth student entering the school in the morning would result in a simple random sample of students attending my school. The options are:\n\nA. Yes, because every student has the same chance of being selected.\n\nB. Yes, but only if there is a single entrance to the school.\n\nC. Yes, because the 24 out of every 25 students who are not selected will form a control group.\n\nD. No, because not every sample of the intended size has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a simple random sample is. A simple random sample is one where every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected, and every possible sample of a given size has an equal chance of being chosen.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the researcher is planning to select every twenty-fifth student entering the school in the morning. Assuming no absences, every student is present.\n\nOption A says yes because every student has the same chance of being selected. But is that true? If the students arrive at different times and some are earlier or later, might that affect their chance of being selected?\n\nOption B says yes, but only if there is a single entrance to the school. I'm not sure why having multiple entrances would affect the randomness. Maybe if students enter through different doors, it could introduce some bias, but the question specifies students entering the school, regardless of which door they use.\n\nOption C mentions that the non-selected students form a control group. I'm not sure how that relates to whether this is a simple random sample. In sampling terms, the non-selected students aren't really a control group in the experimental sense.\n\nOption D says no, because not every sample of the intended size has an equal chance of being selected. That sounds like it's related to the definition of a simple random sample, where every possible sample should have an equal chance.\n\nLet me think more carefully. In a simple random sample, each student has an equal chance of being selected, but also, every combination of students has an equal chance of being the selected sample.\n\nIn this method of selecting every twenty-fifth student, it's a systematic sampling approach. Systematic sampling can be efficient, but it assumes that the population is randomly ordered, which is often not the case.\n\nFor example, if students arrive in groups or according to some pattern, say, older students come earlier, and younger students come later, then selecting every twenty-fifth student might overrepresent one group and underrepresent another.\n\nIn such a case, not every possible sample of the intended size would have an equal chance of being selected because the selection is systematic and not purely random.\n\nOn the other hand, if students arrive completely at random, without any pattern, then this method might approximate a random sample.\n\nBut in practice, student arrivals are unlikely to be completely random, so there might be some bias introduced by this sampling method.\n\nTherefore, I think option D is the correct answer: no, because not every sample of the intended size has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nTo confirm, let's consider an extreme example. Suppose all students arrive in a single line, and the researcher selects every twenty-fifth student from the front of the line. If the line forms in a way that certain students are consistently at the front or back, say, boys at the front and girls at the back, then selecting every twenty-fifth student would always pick students from the same position in the line, introducing bias.\n\nIn this case, not every possible sample would have an equal chance of being selected, as the selection is influenced by the order in which students arrive.\n\nHence, the answer should be D. No, because not every sample of the intended size has an equal chance of being selected.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
