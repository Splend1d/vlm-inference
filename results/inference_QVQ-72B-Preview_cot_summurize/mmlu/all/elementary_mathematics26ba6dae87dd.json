                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem where I need to find out how many more books the Mills Library has compared to the Springvale Library, and then pick the best estimate from the options given. The numbers are pretty big: Mills has 1,007,199 books, and Springvale has 907,082 books. So, I need to subtract 907,082 from 1,007,199 to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I'll set up the subtraction problem:\n\n1,007,199\n\n-  907,082\n\n----------------\n\nI remember that when subtracting large numbers, it's helpful to break them down by place value. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n9 (units) minus 2 (units): 9 - 2 = 7\n\nNow, the tens place:\n\n9 (tens) minus 8 (tens): 90 - 80 = 10\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 9 is less than 8. Actually, I think I need to borrow here.\n\nSo, in the tens place, since 9 is less than 8, I'll borrow 1 from the hundreds place. The hundreds place is 0, so I need to borrow from the thousands place.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way to do this.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of thousands and hundreds. Let's try subtracting the thousands first.\n\n1,007,199 minus 907,082.\n\nFirst, subtract 900,000 from 1,000,000:\n\n1,000,000 - 900,000 = 100,000\n\nThen, subtract the remaining 7,082 from 7,199:\n\n7,199 - 7,082 = 117\n\nSo, total difference is 100,000 + 117 = 100,117 books.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them are exactly 100,117. So, I need to find the best estimate among the choices.\n\nOption A is 100,000 books.\n\nOption B is 80,000 books.\n\nOption C is 10,000 books.\n\nOption D is 8,000 books.\n\nMy exact answer is 100,117, which is closest to 100,000. But there's a 117 difference, which is not negligible, but among the options, 100,000 is the closest estimate.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if there's a better way to estimate.\n\nAnother approach could be to round both numbers to the nearest ten thousand and then subtract.\n\nMills Library has 1,007,199 books. That's roughly 1,010,000 if I round to the nearest ten thousand.\n\nSpringvale has 907,082 books, which rounds to 910,000.\n\nSubtracting: 1,010,000 - 910,000 = 100,000 books.\n\nThat matches option A.\n\nAlternatively, if I round to the nearest hundred thousand, Mills is 1,000,000 and Springvale is 900,000, giving 100,000 again.\n\nWait, but 1,007,199 is closer to 1,010,000 than to 1,000,000, so rounding to the nearest ten thousand might be more accurate.\n\nSimilarly, 907,082 is closer to 910,000 than to 900,000.\n\nSo, both ways, I get 100,000 as my estimate.\n\nLooking back at my exact calculation of 100,117, it's very close to 100,000, so option A seems correct.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's a better estimate among the options.\n\nOption A: 100,000 books\n\nOption B: 80,000 books\n\nOption C: 10,000 books\n\nOption D: 8,000 books\n\nSince 100,117 is closest to 100,000, I think A is the best answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question wants a more precise estimate. But given that it's an estimate, and the options are in tens of thousands, 100,000 is the most appropriate choice.\n\nYeah, I'm confident that the answer is A. 100,000 books.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
