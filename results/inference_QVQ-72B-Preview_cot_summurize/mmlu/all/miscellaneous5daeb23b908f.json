Pedantic, C. Schematic, and D. Cathartic. Okay, let's see. I need to find the word that fits this description.\n\nFirst off, I know that some tribes don't stay in one place; they move around a lot, right? Like, they might follow food sources or seasonal changes. So, they don't have a permanent home base. That sounds a lot like the lifestyle of nomads.\n\nLet me think about what \"nomadic\" means. I believe it comes from the word \"nomad,\" which refers to people who don't have a fixed place of residence and instead move from place to place, usually in search of food, water, or grazing lands for their livestock. So, yeah, that seems to match the description perfectly.\n\nNow, just to be sure, I should check the other options to make sure they don't fit the description better.\n\nOption B is \"pedantic.\" Hmm, I think pedantic means being overly concerned with minor details or rules, especially in a way that is tedious or tiresome. Definitely not related to wandering tribes. So, that can't be it.\n\nOption C is \"schematic.\" I'm not entirely sure what this means. Let me recall. Oh, a schematic is like a diagram or plan. So, it's more about planning or design, not about moving from place to place. Doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nOption D is \"cathartic.\" I think cathartic refers to the release of emotional tension, like feeling relieved after expressing strong emotions. Again, not related to tribes without a set homeland.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, it's clear that \"nomadic\" is the correct choice. It directly describes a group of people who wander from place to place without a permanent home, which matches the question's description perfectly.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider if there's any other word that might fit the description better, but I can't think of one. \"Nomadic\" is the most appropriate term here.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A. Nomadic}} \\]"
