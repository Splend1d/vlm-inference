                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about aggregate supply and demand. It says that if the aggregate supply curve shifts to the left, what happens to the equilibrium price level and the equilibrium quantity of output? And it assumes a Classical aggregate supply curve. Okay, so first things first, I need to understand what a Classical aggregate supply curve looks like and how it affects the economy when it shifts.\n\nSo, from what I remember, the aggregate supply (AS) curve shows the total quantity of goods and services that firms in an economy are willing to produce at a given price level. In the Classical model, the AS curve is vertical in the long run. That means it's fixed at the full employment level of output. So, the economy is always at its potential GDP, regardless of the price level.\n\nNow, if the AS curve shifts to the left, that means the economy's potential output has decreased. This could be due to things like higher production costs, natural disasters that destroy capital, or a decrease in labor supply. So, with a leftward shift in the AS curve, at any given price level, firms are willing to supply less output.\n\nLet me think about how this affects the equilibrium price level and quantity of output.\n\nFirst, in the Classical model, the aggregate demand (AD) curve is downward sloping, showing the relationship between the price level and the quantity of output demanded. The equilibrium occurs where AD and AS intersect.\n\nIf the AS curve shifts to the left, it means that for any given price level, the quantity supplied decreases. This shift will likely lead to an increase in the price level and a decrease in the quantity of output produced.\n\nWait, but the AS curve is vertical in the Classical model, right? So, if it shifts left, it's still vertical but at a lower level of output. So, the equilibrium quantity decreases, and the price level increases.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA. The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\n\nB. The equilibrium price level decreases while the equilibrium quantity of output increases.\n\nC. The equilibrium price level and quantity of output increase.\n\nD. The equilibrium price level remains unchanged while the equilibrium quantity of output increases.\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, option A seems correct. The price level increases, and the quantity of output decreases.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn the Classical model, the AS curve is vertical at the full employment level. If it shifts left, that means full employment output has decreased. So, the economy is now producing less. But what happens to the price level?\n\nWell, if the AS curve shifts left, it's like saying the same quantity is now associated with a higher price level. So, at the new equilibrium, the price level should be higher, and the quantity should be lower.\n\nWait, but is that always the case? Maybe there are scenarios where the price level doesn't change or even decreases? Hmm.\n\nLet me consider the aggregate supply and demand equations.\n\nIn the Classical model, the AS curve is Y = Y*, where Y* is the full employment output. If AS shifts to the left, Y* decreases to, say, Y** < Y*. So, the new AS curve is Y = Y**.\n\nThe AD curve determines the price level based on the quantity demanded. So, at the new lower output level Y**, if the AD curve is such that a decrease in output leads to an increase in the price level, then yes, price level increases.\n\nBut I think I'm overcomplicating it. The key point is that in the Classical model, the AS curve is vertical, and a leftward shift means a decrease in potential output. This shift would typically lead to higher prices and lower output in the short run.\n\nIn the long run, the Classical model assumes that wages and prices are flexible, so the economy will adjust back to full employment. But in the short run, this is what happens.\n\nSo, I think option A is the correct answer: the equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\n\nJust to make sure, let's think about an example. Suppose there's a sudden increase in oil prices, which is a key input for many industries. This would shift the AS curve to the left because production costs have increased. As a result, firms would supply less output at any given price level, leading to a decrease in total output and an increase in the price level.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. So, I'm confident that option A is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
