                    "text": "So I have this problem here about ultraviolet light. It says that ultraviolet light has a wavelength of about 6 \u00d7 10^-8 meters, and I need to find its frequency. The options are A. 5 \u00d7 10^15 Hz, B. 0.5 Hz, C. 2 Hz, and D. 20 Hz.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall the relationship between wavelength and frequency. I remember that the speed of light is equal to the wavelength multiplied by the frequency. So, c = \u03bb\u03bd, where c is the speed of light, \u03bb is the wavelength, and \u03bd is the frequency.\n\nI know that the speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 3 \u00d7 10^8 meters per second. So, if I have the wavelength, I can rearrange the formula to solve for the frequency: \u03bd = c / \u03bb.\n\nGiven that, let's plug in the numbers. Wavelength \u03bb is 6 \u00d7 10^-8 m, and c is 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s. So, \u03bd = (3 \u00d7 10^8) / (6 \u00d7 10^-8).\n\nI need to be careful with the exponents here. When dividing two numbers with exponents, I can subtract them, but in this case, it's the same base, just different exponents.\n\nWait, actually, it's easier to think of it as 3 divided by 6 times 10^8 divided by 10^-8. 3 divided by 6 is 0.5, and 10^8 divided by 10^-8 is 10^(8 - (-8)) = 10^(16). So, \u03bd = 0.5 \u00d7 10^16 Hz.\n\nNow, 0.5 is the same as 5 \u00d7 10^-1, so 5 \u00d7 10^-1 \u00d7 10^16 would be 5 \u00d7 10^15 Hz.\n\nLooking back at the options, that matches with option A. 5 \u00d7 10^15 Hz.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with c = \u03bb\u03bd, rearranged to \u03bd = c / \u03bb, which is correct.\n\nPlugging in c = 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s and \u03bb = 6 \u00d7 10^-8 m, so \u03bd = (3 \u00d7 10^8) / (6 \u00d7 10^-8) = (3/6) \u00d7 10^(8 - (-8)) = 0.5 \u00d7 10^16 Hz = 5 \u00d7 10^15 Hz.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I did anything wrong there.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the units. The speed of light is in meters per second (m/s), wavelength is in meters (m), and frequency should be in hertz (Hz), which is 1/s. So, dividing m/s by m gives Hz, which checks out.\n\nAlso, considering the order of magnitude, ultraviolet light is known to have higher frequencies than visible light, which has frequencies around 10^14 to 10^15 Hz. So, 5 \u00d7 10^15 Hz seems reasonable for ultraviolet light.\n\nI don't think the other options are correct based on this calculation. Option B is 0.5 Hz, which is way too low for ultraviolet light. Similarly, options C and D are 2 Hz and 20 Hz, which are also much lower than the expected frequency range for ultraviolet light.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is A. 5 \u00d7 10^15 Hz.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 5 \\times 10^{15} \\ \\text{Hz}} \\]"
