                    "text": "So I have this question about para-dichlorobenzene, which is used as mothballs. It says that this compound can also be named, and there are four options: A. 1,2-dichlorobenzene, B. 1,3-dichlorobenzene, C. 2,4-dichlorobenzene, D. 1,4-dichlorobenzene. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what para-dichlorobenzene means. I know that benzene is a six-carbon ring with the formula C6H6. Dichlorobenzene means that two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by chlorine atoms. The \"para-\" prefix refers to the position of these chlorine atoms on the benzene ring.\n\nIn benzene, the carbon atoms are arranged in a hexagon, and the positions are numbered from 1 to 6. The terms ortho-, meta-, and para- are used to describe the positions of substituents relative to each other. Specifically:\n\n- Ortho- means adjacent positions, like 1 and 2, or 3 and 4, etc.\n\n- Meta- means positions separated by one carbon, like 1 and 3, or 2 and 4, etc.\n\n- Para- means positions directly across from each other, like 1 and 4.\n\nSo, para-dichlorobenzene should have two chlorine atoms at positions 1 and 4 on the benzene ring.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 1,2-dichlorobenzene: This would place the chlorine atoms at positions 1 and 2, which is ortho-position. So, this is not para-dichlorobenzene.\n\nB. 1,3-dichlorobenzene: This places the chlorine atoms at positions 1 and 3, which is meta-position. Not para.\n\nC. 2,4-dichlorobenzene: This puts the chlorine atoms at positions 2 and 4. Let's see, position 2 and 4 are also para-positions because they are directly across from each other. Wait, in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 4 are para, and so are 2 and 5, and 3 and 6. So, 2 and 4 are actually meta-positions. Wait, no, that can't be right.\n\nHold on, let's visualize the benzene ring. Positions 1, 2, 3 are one set, and 4, 5, 6 are opposite. So, 2 and 4 are not directly across from each other; 1 and 4 are directly across. So, 2 and 4 would be meta-positions. Wait, no: 1 and 4 are para, 1 and 3 are meta, 1 and 2 are ortho. Similarly, from position 2, 4 would be meta. So, 2,4-dichlorobenzene is actually meta-dichlorobenzene, not para.\n\nSo, option C is not para-dichlorobenzene.\n\nD. 1,4-dichlorobenzene: This clearly places the chlorine atoms at positions 1 and 4, which is the para-position. So, this should be the correct name for para-dichlorobenzene.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"para-dichlorobenzene is used as 'mothballs.' This compound can also be named...\" and then gives the options. So, it seems like the question is asking for an alternative name for para-dichlorobenzene, and among the options, which one correctly names para-dichlorobenzene.\n\nFrom my reasoning, option D, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, is the correct name for para-dichlorobenzene.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something tricky here.\n\nI recall that in some contexts, different numbering can lead to different apparent names, but in benzene, the numbering is standard, starting from position 1.\n\nAlso, sometimes, different isomers are named differently based on their properties, but in this case, the structural formula should directly correspond to the naming.\n\nLet me consider the structural formula of para-dichlorobenzene: two chlorine atoms at positions 1 and 4.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 1,2-dichlorobenzene: That's ortho.\n\nB. 1,3-dichlorobenzene: That's meta.\n\nC. 2,4-dichlorobenzene: That's meta, as I previously thought.\n\nD. 1,4-dichlorobenzene: That's para.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. 1,4-dichlorobenzene.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"para-dichlorobenzene is used as 'mothballs.' This compound can also be named...\" and then lists the options. It seems like there might be a typo or something, because option C is 2,4-dichlorobenzene, which is meta, not para.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct choice is D. 1,4-dichlorobenzene.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some contexts, 2,4-dichlorobenzene could be considered as para, but that doesn't align with standard numbering.\n\nLet me confirm this with a quick online search or reference to a chemistry textbook.\n\n[Imagining searching for \"para-dichlorobenzene structure\" and finding that it is indeed 1,4-dichlorobenzene.]\n\nYes, according to standard nomenclature, para-dichlorobenzene is 1,4-dichlorobenzene.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 1,4-dichlorobenzene.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
