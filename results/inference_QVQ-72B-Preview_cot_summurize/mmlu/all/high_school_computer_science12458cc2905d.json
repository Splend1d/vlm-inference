                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about a data set that has information on all students majoring in computer science across the United States. The data includes their gender, the state where they go to college, and their GPA on a 4.0 scale. Now, I need to figure out which of these questions can be answered using only this data.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Do students majoring in computer science tend to have higher grade point averages than students majoring in other subjects?\n\nHmm, here's the thing. The data set only includes computer science majors. So, it has GPA information for these students, but to compare their GPAs with students in other majors, I'd need data on those other majors too, right? Since that information isn't provided in this data set, I don't think I can answer this question with only what's given here. So, probably not option A.\n\nOption B: How many states have a higher percentage of female computer science majors than male computer science majors attending college in that state?\n\nOkay, this seems promising. The data set includes the gender of each student and the state where they attend college. So, for each state, I can count the number of female computer science majors and the number of male computer science majors. Then, I can calculate the percentages and see in how many states the percentage of female majors is higher than that of male majors.\n\nWait a minute, percentages might be a bit tricky. Do I need to consider the total number of computer science majors in each state to find percentages? Probably, because the percentage would be the number of female majors divided by the total number of majors in that state, and similarly for males. Then, compare the two percentages for each state.\n\nYes, with this data, I can do that. I have the number of female and male CS majors in each state, and I can calculate the totals to find the percentages. So, this seems like a question that can be answered using the provided data.\n\nOption C: What percent of students attending college in a certain state are majoring in computer science?\n\nAlright, this is a bit different. Here, I need to find out what percentage of all students in a particular state are majoring in computer science.\n\nLooking at the data set, it has information about all computer science majors across the United States, including their states. However, to find the percentage of students in a certain state who are CS majors, I need to know the total number of students in that state, not just the CS majors.\n\nWait, does the data set include information about all students in all states, or just the CS majors? It says \"about all students majoring in computer science,\" so it's only including CS majors. That means I don't have data on the total number of students in each state, just the CS majors.\n\nTherefore, without knowing the total number of students in a state, I can't calculate the percentage that are CS majors. So, I can't answer this question with only the given data set.\n\nOption D: Which college has the highest number of students majoring in computer science?\n\nThis seems tricky. The data set provides the state where each student attends college, but not specifically the college name. So, if I only know the state, but not the college within that state, I can't determine which specific college has the most CS majors.\n\nUnless, maybe, there's a way to infer the college based on the number of students in a state, but that seems unlikely. Most states have multiple colleges, so I'd need more granular data to answer this question.\n\nTherefore, with only state-level data, I can't determine which college has the highest number of CS majors.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, it seems that only option B can be answered using the information provided in the data set.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let's double-check option B.\n\nOption B asks for the number of states where the percentage of female CS majors is higher than that of male CS majors.\n\nWith the data set providing the number of female and male CS majors in each state, I can calculate the percentages as:\n\nPercentage of female CS majors in a state = (number of female CS majors in the state) / (total CS majors in the state) * 100%\n\nSimilarly for male CS majors.\n\nThen, I can compare these two percentages for each state and count how many states have the female percentage higher than the male percentage.\n\nYes, that's feasible with the given data.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
