                    "text": "Let's tackle this logic problem. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step. The sentence is:\n\n\"Either England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture or China's promoting human rights is not a sufficient condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"necessary condition\" and \"sufficient condition\" mean in logical terms.\n\nA necessary condition for an event is one that must be present for the event to occur. In logical terms, if E is necessary for F, that means F implies E (F \u2283 E), because for F to be true, E must be true.\n\nA sufficient condition for an event is one that, if present, guarantees the event occurs. So, if C is sufficient for S, that means C implies S (C \u2283 S).\n\nNow, the sentence has two parts connected by \"either...or,\" which translates to a disjunction (\u2228) in logic.\n\nSo, the first part is: \"England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.\"\n\nAs established, necessary condition translates to F \u2283 E.\n\nThe second part is: \"China's promoting human rights is not a sufficient condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds.\"\n\nNot being a sufficient condition means that C does not imply S. In logic, \u00ac(C \u2283 S). But C \u2283 S is equivalent to \u00acC \u2228 S, so \u00ac(C \u2283 S) is \u00ac(\u00acC \u2228 S), which by De Morgan's laws is C \u2227 \u00acS.\n\nSo, the second part is C \u2227 \u00acS.\n\nPutting it all together, the logical form of the sentence is:\n\n(F \u2283 E) \u2228 (C \u2227 \u00acS)\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\n\nA. (E \u2261 F) \u2228 ~(C \u2261 S)\n\nB. (E \u2261 F) \u2228 (~C \u2283 S)\n\nC. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 ~(C \u2283 S)\n\nD. (F \u2283 E) \u2228 ~(C \u2283 S)\n\nComparing this with what I derived, the correct form should be (F \u2283 E) \u2228 ~(C \u2283 S).\n\nLooking at option D: (F \u2283 E) \u2228 ~(C \u2283 S), which matches exactly with what I have.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that my interpretation is correct.\n\nLet me double-check the translation of \"not a sufficient condition.\" If C is not a sufficient condition for S, it means that C does not guarantee S, which is indeed the negation of (C \u2283 S), so ~(C \u2283 S) is correct.\n\nAlso, the necessary condition is correctly translated as (F \u2283 E), not (E \u2283 F). Because if E is necessary for F, then F can only be true if E is true, which is F \u2283 E.\n\nWait a minute, in the first part, it says \"England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.\" So, F \u2283 E is correct, because E is necessary for F.\n\nBut in the options, option D has (F \u2283 E) \u2228 ~(C \u2283 S), which matches what I have.\n\nOption C has (E \u2283 F) \u2228 ~(C \u2283 S), which is different.\n\nGiven that (F \u2283 E) is the correct translation for \"E is necessary for F,\" option D seems correct.\n\nOption A has (E \u2261 F), which is a biconditional, not matching the necessary condition.\n\nOption B has (E \u2261 F) again, and the second part is (~C \u2283 S), which is not the same as ~(C \u2283 S).\n\nOption C has (E \u2283 F), which is the converse of what is needed.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct one.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the sentence.\n\n\"Either England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture or China's promoting human rights is not a sufficient condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds.\"\n\nAnother way to read this is:\n\n(NECESSARY CONDITION: E for F) \u2228 (NOT SUFFICIENT CONDITION: C for S)\n\nAs translated earlier, this is (F \u2283 E) \u2228 ~(C \u2283 S)\n\nSo, again, option D matches this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to interpret \"not a sufficient condition.\" Maybe it could be interpreted as \"C is not sufficient for S,\" which still translates to ~(C \u2283 S), so no confusion there.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option D.\n\nWait, but in option D, it's written as (F \u2283 E) \u2228 ~(C \u2283 S), which matches what I have.\n\nSo, the final answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
