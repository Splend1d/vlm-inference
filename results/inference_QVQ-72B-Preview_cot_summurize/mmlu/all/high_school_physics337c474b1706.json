                    "text": "So I have this problem here: an object is released from rest and falls a distance h during the first second of time. I need to figure out how far it will fall during the next second of time. The options are A. h, B. 2h, C. 3h, D. 4h.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what's going on. The object is falling freely under gravity, right? So, it's experiencing constant acceleration due to gravity, which is about 9.8 m/s\u00b2 near the Earth's surface.\n\nThe problem says it falls a distance h in the first second. Since it starts from rest, its initial velocity is zero. I can use the equation of motion that relates distance, acceleration, and time.\n\nThe equation is:\n\n\\[ s = v_i t + \\frac{1}{2} a t^2 \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( s \\) is the displacement\n\n- \\( v_i \\) is the initial velocity\n\n- \\( t \\) is time\n\n- \\( a \\) is acceleration\n\nGiven that it falls a distance h in the first second, and it starts from rest (\\( v_i = 0 \\)), the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ h = 0 \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 9.8 \\cdot (1)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 9.8 \\cdot 1 \\]\n\n\\[ h = 4.9 \\] meters\n\nWait, but h is just a symbol for the distance fallen in the first second, so it's not necessarily 4.9 meters. Maybe I should keep it in terms of h.\n\nSo, in the first second, the distance fallen is:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{1}{2} g (1)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{1}{2} g \\]\n\nNow, I need to find out how far it falls in the next second, which is from t=1 to t=2 seconds.\n\nAt t=1 second, the velocity of the object is:\n\n\\[ v = v_i + a t \\]\n\n\\[ v = 0 + 9.8 \\cdot 1 \\]\n\n\\[ v = 9.8 \\] m/s\n\nSo, at the start of the second second, the object already has a velocity of 9.8 m/s downward.\n\nNow, during the second second, from t=1 to t=2, the distance fallen can be found using the same equation of motion.\n\nThe distance fallen in a time interval \\( \\Delta t \\) when the initial velocity is \\( v_i \\) is:\n\n\\[ s = v_i \\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2} a (\\Delta t)^2 \\]\n\nHere, \\( v_i = 9.8 \\) m/s, \\( a = 9.8 \\) m/s\u00b2, and \\( \\Delta t = 1 \\) second.\n\n\\[ s = 9.8 \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 9.8 \\cdot (1)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ s = 9.8 + 4.9 \\]\n\n\\[ s = 14.7 \\] meters\n\nNow, comparing this to the first second, where it fell h = 4.9 meters, in the second second it falls 14.7 meters.\n\nSo, how does 14.7 relate to 4.9?\n\n\\[ \\frac{14.7}{4.9} = 3 \\]\n\nSo, during the next second, it falls 3 times the distance it fell in the first second.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 3h.\n\nWait a minute, but let's check if this is always true, regardless of the value of g.\n\nFrom the first equation, \\( h = \\frac{1}{2} g \\).\n\nIn the second second, \\( s = v \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{2} g \\cdot 1^2 \\), where v is the velocity at t=1.\n\nAnd v at t=1 is g \\cdot 1 = g.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ s = g + \\frac{1}{2} g = \\frac{3}{2} g \\]\n\nAnd \\( h = \\frac{1}{2} g \\), so\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{3}{2} g = 3 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} g \\right) = 3h \\]\n\nYes, so regardless of the value of g, the distance fallen in the second second is 3 times the distance fallen in the first second.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to consider the total distance fallen in two seconds and subtract the distance fallen in the first second.\n\nThe total distance fallen in two seconds is:\n\n\\[ s_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1}{2} g (2)^2 = 2g \\]\n\nSo, in two seconds, it falls 2g meters.\n\nIn one second, it falls \\( h = \\frac{1}{2} g \\).\n\nTherefore, in the second second, it falls:\n\n\\[ s_{\\text{second second}} = s_{\\text{total}} - s_{\\text{first second}} = 2g - \\frac{1}{2} g = \\frac{3}{2} g = 3h \\]\n\nAgain, confirming that it falls 3h in the second second.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 3h.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
