Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that ABBA is a famous disco band from the 70s. They had a lot of hits like \"Dancing Queen\" and \"Waterloo.\" But where are they from? Let me think about this.\n\nI think I've heard somewhere that ABBA is Swedish. Yeah, that sounds familiar. But let me make sure I'm not mixing them up with another band.\n\nNorway is also in Scandinavia, close to Sweden, but I don't think ABBA is from there. Maybe I'm just getting them confused because they're from the same region.\n\nSwitzerland is a different part of Europe, more central, and I don't recall any connection between ABBA and Switzerland.\n\nThe Netherlands is known for other things, like tulips and windmills, but not sure about their music scene in the 70s.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the members of ABBA. There were two men and two women, right? Bj\u00f6rn, Benny, Agnetha, and Anni-Frid. I think they all have Swedish names. Bj\u00f6rn and Benny sound Swedish, and Agnetha and Anni-Frid also seem Scandinavian.\n\nAlso, I remember that ABBA won the Eurovision Song Contest for Sweden in 1974 with \"Waterloo.\" That must mean they're Swedish, since they represented Sweden in the competition.\n\nLet me double-check this. Eurovision is a contest where each country sends a singer or band to represent them. So, if ABBA was Sweden's entry, then they must be from Sweden.\n\nI don't think Norway, Switzerland, or the Netherlands have any direct link to ABBA. Maybe I'm overthinking this.\n\nAnother thing I recall is that ABBA's music has a lot of Scandinavian influence, which again points to Sweden.\n\nWait, but sometimes bands might have members from different countries, so maybe not all of them are Swedish. But in ABBA's case, I think all four members are Swedish.\n\nI should consider if there's any possibility that ABBA is not solely Swedish, but I don't think that's the case.\n\nLet me try to eliminate some options:\n\n- Norway: Unlikely, as I don't associate ABBA with Norway.\n\n- Sweden: Seems the most plausible.\n\n- Switzerland: No connection I can think of.\n\n- The Netherlands: Also no direct association with ABBA.\n\nSo, based on what I know, Sweden is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll think about some famous Swedish bands to confirm that ABBA is one of them. There's Roxette, Ace of Base, and of course, ABBA. So, yeah, ABBA is definitely Swedish.\n\nI don't want to second-guess myself here. I'm pretty confident that ABBA comes from Sweden.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is B. Sweden.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Sweden}} \\]"
