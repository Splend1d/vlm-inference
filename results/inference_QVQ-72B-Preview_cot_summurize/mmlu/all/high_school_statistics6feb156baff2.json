                    "text": "So I have this question about how tripling the sample size affects the confidence interval size. The options are:\n\nA. It triples the interval size.\n\nB. It divides the interval size by 3.\n\nC. It multiples the interval size by 1.732.\n\nD. It divides the interval size by 1.732.\n\nHmm, I need to recall how sample size relates to the confidence interval width. I know that the confidence interval for a mean is calculated as:\n\n\\[\\text{CI} = \\bar{x} \\pm z \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean\n\n- \\(z\\) is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level\n\n- \\(\\sigma\\) is the population standard deviation\n\n- \\(n\\) is the sample size\n\nSo, the interval width is basically \\(2z \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)\\).\n\nFrom this, it seems like the interval width is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size. That is, if you triple the sample size, the denominator \\(\\sqrt{n}\\) becomes larger, and thus the interval width decreases.\n\nBut how exactly does it decrease? Since it's inversely proportional to \\(\\sqrt{n}\\), tripling \\(n\\) would make \\(\\sqrt{n}\\) become \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) times larger. So, the interval width would be divided by \\(\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nWhat's \\(\\sqrt{3}\\)? Let me check. \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) is approximately 1.732. So, if I triple the sample size, the interval width should be divided by approximately 1.732.\n\nWait, but option C says it multiplies the interval size by 1.732, which would be incorrect based on my reasoning. Option D says it divides the interval size by 1.732, which seems to align with my thoughts.\n\nLet me double-check this. If I have a sample size \\(n\\), and I triple it to \\(3n\\), the square root in the denominator changes from \\(\\sqrt{n}\\) to \\(\\sqrt{3n} = \\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{n}\\). So, the interval width becomes \\(2z \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{3n}} \\right) = \\frac{2z \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)}{\\sqrt{3}}\\).\n\nTherefore, the new interval width is the old interval width divided by \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), which is roughly 1.732.\n\nSo, tripling the sample size should divide the interval size by approximately 1.732.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this relationship. For example, does the confidence level change? No, the question doesn't mention changing the confidence level, so I assume it remains the same.\n\nAlso, is the population standard deviation changing? No, it should stay the same since it's the same population.\n\nTherefore, based on this, option D seems correct.\n\nHowever, I should think about whether there's any scenario where tripling the sample size could triple the interval size, as option A suggests. That doesn't seem right, because increasing the sample size generally leads to a narrower confidence interval, not a wider one.\n\nSimilarly, option B suggests it divides the interval size by 3. But according to the formula, it's divided by \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), not by 3.\n\nOption C says it multiplies the interval size by 1.732, which would mean increasing the interval size, but as I previously reasoned, increasing the sample size should actually decrease the interval size.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the correct choice.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider an example. Suppose we have a population with a standard deviation of 10, and a sample size of 4. The confidence interval width would be:\n\n\\[\\text{width} = 2z \\left( \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{4}} \\right) = 2z \\left( \\frac{10}{2} \\right) = 2z(5) = 10z\\]\n\nIf we triple the sample size to 12, the width becomes:\n\n\\[\\text{width} = 2z \\left( \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{12}} \\right) \\approx 2z \\left( \\frac{10}{3.464} \\right) \\approx 2z(2.886) \\approx 5.772z\\]\n\nComparing the two widths:\n\nOriginal width: 10z\n\nNew width: 5.772z\n\nSo, the new width is approximately 5.772z, which is 10z divided by \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) (since \\(\\sqrt{12/4} = \\sqrt{3}\\)).\n\nIndeed, \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) is about 1.732, so 10z divided by 1.732 is approximately 5.772z.\n\nTherefore, the interval size is divided by \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), which is roughly 1.732.\n\nHence, the correct answer is option D: it divides the interval size by 1.732.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
