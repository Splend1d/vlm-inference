Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the \u0153cumenical position, the \u0153cumenical traditions, of Rome&\u2026.\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\nEdward A.

                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about Italy's history and traditions being \"fully snapped.\" It's from a text by Edward A. Freeman, a British historian, writing in 1885. The question is asking according to the author, when were Italy's connections to its history and traditions most completely broken, or \"fully snapped.\" The options are:\n\nA. When Sicily ceased to be an independent kingdom.\n\nB. When Italians liberated Rome.\n\nC. When Rome became the head of a French Department.\n\nD. When French troops abandoned Rome to fight in the Franco-Prussian War.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the author is saying in this passage. He seems to be discussing the unification of Italy and its impact on historical entities like Sicily and Rome. Let me try to break it down.\n\nHe mentions that Italy has been united \"at last,\" and everyone rejoiced in its union. But then he says that maybe the union was \"a little too speedy and a little too thorough.\" He specifically mentions the case of Sicily, which was once an \"independent being\" with its own name and identity, but now it's just \"seven provinces\" of the mainland kingdom. He even says it's \"carrying unity too far\" to erase all traces of Sicily's independent existence, to the point where its name is no longer even a geographical expression. That seems pretty strong; he's lamenting the loss of Sicily's distinct identity due to Italian unification.\n\nNext, he talks about Rome and its role in European history. He mentions that Rome was once the center of a dominion with acknowledged boundaries and the head of a local Italian kingdom. This seems to refer to the Papal States or something similar. Then he says that when the Italian army entered liberated Rome, it ended a great phase of European history. He uses phrases like \"never were ties with the past so fully snapped\" and \"the greatest of all novelties in European history.\" This suggests that the incorporation of Rome into the Italian kingdom was a significant break from the past.\n\nHe also mentions that making Rome the capital of Italy was a formula that gladdened hearts but formally swept away Rome's \"\u0153cumenical position and traditions.\" He explains that by becoming the head of an Italian kingdom, Rome cast aside its imperial traditions, which were not cast aside even when it was made the head of a French department under Napoleon.\n\nSo, from this, it seems like the author is highlighting two main breaks with the past: the loss of Sicily's independence and the incorporation of Rome into the Italian kingdom.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Sicily ceased to be an independent kingdom.\n\nThis seems to align with what the author is lamenting about Sicily losing its distinct identity and name. But is this the point where connections to history and traditions were most fully snapped?\n\nOption B: Italians liberated Rome.\n\nThis seems to be a significant event mentioned in the passage. The author describes it as a moment when ties with the past were fully snapped, and it ended a great phase of European history. That sounds pretty definitive.\n\nOption C: Rome became the head of a French Department.\n\nThis refers to when Rome was under French rule during Napoleon's time. The author mentions that even then, Rome's imperial traditions were not fully cast aside. So, perhaps this was not as complete a break as what happened later.\n\nOption D: French troops abandoned Rome to fight in the Franco-Prussian War.\n\nThis event led to the capture of Rome by the Italians in 1870, as the French garrison that was protecting the Papal States was withdrawn to fight in the Franco-Prussian War. This allowed the Italian army to occupy Rome and make it the capital of the newly unified Italy.\n\nGiven that, it seems that the liberation of Rome by the Italians and its incorporation into the Italian kingdom was the moment when the most significant break with the past occurred, according to the author.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nThe author says, \"Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome.\" That seems to directly point to option B.\n\nHe also says, \"Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\n\nThis again emphasizes that the incorporation of Rome into the Italian kingdom was a more complete break with its imperial traditions than when it was part of a French department under Napoleon.\n\nSo, it appears that the author considers the liberation of Rome by the Italians and its incorporation into the Italian kingdom as the moment when Italy's connections to its history and traditions were most fully snapped.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: When Italians liberated Rome.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that another option could be more accurate.\n\nOption A: Sicily ceased to be an independent kingdom.\n\nWhile the author does express regret over the loss of Sicily's independent identity, he doesn't describe it as the point where ties with the past were fully snapped. That phrasing is specifically used for the liberation of Rome.\n\nOption C: Rome became the head of a French Department.\n\nThe author mentions that even under French rule, Rome's imperial traditions were not fully cast aside. So, this event was not as complete a break as what happened later with Italian unification.\n\nOption D: French troops abandoned Rome to fight in the Franco-Prussian War.\n\nThis event was a precursor to the Italian army entering Rome, but it's not directly described as the moment when ties with the past were fully snapped. That seems to be reserved for the actual entry and incorporation of Rome into Italy.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, I conclude that the answer is option B: When Italians liberated Rome.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
