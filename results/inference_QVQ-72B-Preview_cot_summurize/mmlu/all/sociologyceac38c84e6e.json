                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question about Becker and his views on cannabis use, particularly in the context of the 1970s and youth culture. Let me see what the options are.\n\nOption A says that cannabis use was increasing throughout all sections of youth in the 1970s. Hmm, that seems plausible. I know that the 1970s were a time when drug use, especially marijuana, was on the rise among young people. There was a lot of counterculture movement, and drugs were part of that scene. But I need to make sure if Becker specifically proclaimed that.\n\nOption B says that cannabis use is learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career. This sounds interesting. I recall that Becker was a sociologist who emphasized the social construction of deviance. He talked about how deviance is not inherent in an act but is labeled as such through social processes. So, according to him, using cannabis might be seen as deviant because society labels it that way, and people learn this through their social interactions. This seems to align with his general theories.\n\nOption C says that cannabis is a dangerous pastime that young people should not be allowed to pursue. This seems a bit prescriptive and moralistic. Becker was more of an observer and theorist, not someone who prescribed what people should or shouldn't do. Plus, his work was more about understanding the social construction of deviance rather than commenting on the dangers of specific substances.\n\nOption D says that cannabis use is not as enjoyable as other sociologists had suggested. This seems out of place. I don't recall Becker making statements about the enjoyment derived from cannabis use. His focus was more on the social labeling and the processes through which certain behaviors come to be seen as deviant.\n\nLet me think again. The question is about what Becker proclaimed regarding cannabis use. Proclaimed suggests that he made a public statement or assertion about it.\n\nI know that Becker's famous work, \"Outsiders: Studies in the Sociology of Deviance,\" discusses how deviance is constructed through social processes. He uses the example of marijuana users to illustrate his points. So, perhaps his views on cannabis use are tied into his broader theories on deviance.\n\nGiven that, option B seems to align closely with his theoretical perspective. He argued that deviance is not inherent in the act itself but is constructed through social interaction and labeling. Therefore, cannabis use would be seen as deviant because of the way society defines it and how individuals learn this definition through their social experiences.\n\nOption A, while reflecting the historical context of the 1970s, doesn't directly relate to Becker's theoretical contributions. He was more about the how and why of deviance rather than reporting statistical increases in behavior.\n\nOption C doesn't seem to fit because Becker wasn't known for taking moral stands on drug use; rather, he analyzed the social processes that lead to certain behaviors being labeled as deviant.\n\nOption D is completely unrelated to his work and seems like a distractor.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is option B: learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career. This captures the essence of Becker's perspective on how cannabis use becomes deviant through social processes.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll recall one of Becker's key points from \"Outsiders.\" He argued that deviance is not a quality inherent in an act or person but is instead something that is socially constructed through interaction. So, someone who uses cannabis may be labeled as deviant, and through this labeling process, they may come to see themselves as deviant, which can affect their future behavior.\n\nThis process involves several stages, including recognition of the deviant act, the reaction to it, and the individual's response to being labeled. Over time, through repeated interactions, the individual may internalize this label and it becomes part of their self-identity.\n\nSo, yes, this directly supports option B, which states that cannabis use is learned gradually through social processes of a deviant career. It's about the progression from initial acts to the adoption of a deviant identity.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
