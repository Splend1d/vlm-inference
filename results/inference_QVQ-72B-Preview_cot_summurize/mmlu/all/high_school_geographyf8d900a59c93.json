They are technologically advanced.\n\nB. They are wealthy.\n\nC. They are powerful.\n\nD. They are less developed.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what a \"core\" country is. From what I recall, the concept of \"core\" countries comes from world systems theory, which divides the world into core, periphery, and sometimes semi-periphery countries. Core countries are essentially the most developed and industrialized nations that dominate global economic and political systems.\n\nSo, given that, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Technologically advanced: Core countries are known for their advanced technology. They invest heavily in research and development, and often lead in innovation. So, this seems true.\n\nB. Wealthy: Core countries are typically rich in terms of GDP per capita and overall economic output. They have high standards of living and strong economies. So, this also seems true.\n\nC. Powerful: Given their economic might and often significant military capabilities, core countries tend to be powerful on the global stage. They may have substantial influence in international organizations and in setting global agendas. So, this seems true as well.\n\nD. Less developed: This seems contradictory to the previous points. If core countries are technologically advanced, wealthy, and powerful, they wouldn't be considered less developed. In fact, they are usually referred to as more developed or industrially developed countries. So, this appears to be not true.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Is there a possibility that some core countries could be less developed in certain aspects? Well, no. The very definition of core countries is that they are the most developed and advanced nations. Periphery countries are the less developed ones, often dependent on the core countries economically.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option D seems to be the statement that is NOT true of core countries.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any chance that core countries could be less developed in some contexts. For example, perhaps in terms of sustainability or certain social indicators, but generally speaking, core countries are considered more developed across multiple dimensions.\n\nMoreover, the term \"less developed\" is generally used for countries that are economically underdeveloped or have lower levels of industrialization, which are typically the periphery countries in world systems theory.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. They are less developed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
