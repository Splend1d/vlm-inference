And it's asking what this is referred to as. The options are time utility, place utility, ownership utility, and information utility.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means in the context of marketing or business.\n\nStarting with time utility, I think it has something to do with making a product available when it's needed or wanted by the consumer. So, like, if a product is seasonally available, but consumers can buy it year-round, that might be time utility.\n\nPlace utility seems to be about making the product available where the consumers are, so they don't have to go far to get it. That sounds a lot like what the question is describing. Intermediaries, like distributors or retailers, bring products from the manufacturer to different locations where consumers can easily access them.\n\nOwnership utility might be related to changing the form of ownership, maybe from the manufacturer to the consumer, or something along those lines. Not entirely sure about this one.\n\nInformation utility probably involves providing useful information to consumers about the product, like its features, benefits, or how to use it.\n\nGiven that, the scenario in the question is specifically about bringing the product to a more convenient location. So, it's about the place where the product is available, not the time it's available, who owns it, or information about it.\n\nLet me double-check this. If intermediaries are bringing the product from a distant production site to a local store, that's definitely making it more accessible in terms of location. So, place utility seems to fit best here.\n\nI don't think time utility is the right answer because the focus isn't on when the product is available, but where it's available.\n\nOwnership utility might be involved in the process, like when the intermediary buys the product from the manufacturer and sells it to the consumer, but the primary benefit being described here is the convenience of location, not the change in ownership.\n\nInformation utility isn't relevant to this scenario either, as the question is about the physical movement of the product to a better location, not about providing information about the product.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I would say that the correct answer is place utility.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any chance that another option could also apply. For example, could time utility also be a factor here? Well, maybe if the intermediary stores the product and makes it available over time, but the question seems to emphasize the location aspect more than the timing.\n\nOwnership utility might be a part of the process, but it's not the main benefit being described. The primary benefit is the product being brought closer to the consumer for easier access.\n\nInformation utility doesn't seem to factor into this scenario at all.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the best answer is place utility.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Place utility.}} \\]"
