                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out whether this letter should be suppressed as evidence or not. Let me try to understand what's going on step by step.\n\nFirst, the police have a warrant to arrest Bill for selling narcotics. They go to Bill's house, which is a two-story colonial. They knock on the door and Bill's brother, Mark, lets them in. The officers show Mark the arrest warrant and ask if he's Bill. He says no, he's Bill's brother and is staying there while Bill is away on a business trip.\n\nThen, one of the officers asks Mark for identification. Mark only has an out-of-state driver's license. This makes the other officer suspicious, so he decides to frisk Mark. During the pat-down, he finds this letter that seems to suggest some kind of plot against Bill.\n\nAfter finding the letter, Mark nervously agrees to let the officers search the house. They spend two hours searching but don't find anything interesting. As they're leaving, one officer notices that the trunk of a car in the driveway is slightly open. When he looks inside, he finds Bill's body.\n\nNow, Mark's attorney wants to suppress the letter as evidence. I need to determine if the court should allow this.\n\nLet me think about the circumstances under which evidence can be suppressed. Generally, evidence obtained in violation of a person's constitutional rights, like unreasonable searches and seizures, can be suppressed under the exclusionary rule. This is to prevent the government from profiting from its own wrongs and to deter future unlawful conduct by law enforcement.\n\nSo, the key question here is whether the letter was obtained through a lawful search or not.\n\nFirst, let's look at the frisk. The officer frisks Mark because he's suspicious after seeing only an out-of-state driver's license. Is this frisk lawful?\n\nA frisk, or pat-down, is a search for weapons for officer safety. It's generally permitted if the officer has reasonable suspicion that the person is armed and dangerous. Here, the officer might have had some grounds for suspicion based on Mark's out-of-state license and the fact that they're there to arrest Bill for narcotics sales.\n\nBut, wait a minute, was there reasonable suspicion that Mark was armed and dangerous? He was staying at Bill's house, and they had a warrant for Bill's arrest. Maybe the officer thought Mark was involved somehow, but is that enough?\n\nLet me recall the Terry v. Ohio case, which established that officers can conduct a frisk if they have specific and articulable facts leading them to believe that the person is armed and presently dangerous.\n\nIn this scenario, the officer became suspicious upon seeing an out-of-state driver's license. Is that sufficient reasonable suspicion for a frisk? It seems a bit thin, but maybe in the context of executing an arrest warrant for narcotics sales, it could be considered reasonable.\n\nBut, assuming the frisk was lawful, what about the letter? The letter was found during the frisk. Normally, a frisk is supposed to be for weapons, not for evidence of crimes. So, was it lawful to seize the letter?\n\nThe plain view doctrine allows officers to seize evidence that is immediately apparent as contraband or evidence of a crime without a warrant, provided they have a lawful right to be in the position to view it.\n\nIn this case, the officer was lawfully frisking Mark for weapons, and during that process, he found the letter. The letter appears to suggest a plot against Bill, which could be relevant to a potential crime.\n\nSo, perhaps the letter was seized lawfully under the plain view doctrine.\n\nBut wait, the frisk is supposed to be limited to weapons that could pose a danger to the officer. Seizing evidence of a different crime might be beyond the scope.\n\nLet me check case law on this. I recall that in Michigan v. Chapman, the Supreme Court held that officers conducting a protective frisk for weapons cannot seize evidence of a crime unless it is immediately apparent as contraband or evidence of the crime they're investigating.\n\nIn this case, the officers were there to arrest Bill for narcotics sales, but the letter seems unrelated to that crime. It suggests a plot against Bill, possibly a different crime.\n\nSo, maybe the seizure of the letter was beyond the scope of the frisk and therefore unlawful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the letter was in Mark's possession, and the officer saw it during the frisk, which was lawful, and then seized it because it was evidence of a crime.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the letter was in Mark's pocket, and during the frisk, the officer felt something that he thought was a weapon but turned out to be the letter.\n\nIf that's the case, then the seizure might be lawful under the plain view doctrine, as long as the officer had a lawful right to be in that position.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I need to consider another angle.\n\nWhat if the letter was found during the search of the house after Mark consented to the search?\n\nNo, the letter was found during the frisk, before the consent search of the house.\n\nWait, the sequence is important here. The officers frisk Mark, find the letter, then Mark consents to a search of the house.\n\nSo, the letter was found during the frisk, and then the consent search followed.\n\nSo, the letter was found before the consent search.\n\nTherefore, the admissibility of the letter depends on whether the frisk was lawful and whether the seizure of the letter during the frisk was lawful.\n\nAs I thought earlier, the frisk might have been lawful based on reasonable suspicion, but the seizure of the letter might have been beyond the scope of the frisk.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the letter was in plain view during the frisk, and the officer seized it because it was evidence of a crime.\n\nBut, again, the frisk is supposed to be limited to weapons for officer safety, not for finding evidence of crimes.\n\nMaybe the officer had probable cause to believe that Mark was involved in some criminal activity based on the letter, which suggested a plot against Bill.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps the seizure of the letter was lawful as incident to the arrest of Mark.\n\nWait, but Mark wasn't arrested at that point. The officers only frisked him and found the letter, then Mark consented to a search of the house.\n\nSo, was Mark arrested before or after the frisk?\n\nThe scenario says that Mark \"nervously agreed to allow the policemen to search the house.\" It doesn't specify that he was arrested at that point.\n\nMaybe the officers arrested Mark after finding the letter, but it's not clear.\n\nAssuming Mark was not arrested before the frisk, then the seizure of the letter wouldn't be incident to arrest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the officers had probable cause to arrest Mark based on the letter, which suggested a plot against Bill.\n\nIf they had probable cause to believe that Mark was involved in a crime against Bill, then they could arrest him and seize the letter as incident to that arrest.\n\nBut again, it's not clear from the scenario whether Mark was arrested before or after the frisk.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose that the frisk was lawful based on reasonable suspicion for officer safety, and during the frisk, the officer found the letter, which was not related to the reason for the frisk.\n\nIn that case, was it lawful to seize the letter?\n\nI think that in such a situation, the officer can seize evidence that is immediately apparent as contraband or evidence of a crime, even if it's not related to the reason for the frisk.\n\nSo, perhaps the seizure of the letter was lawful under the plain view doctrine.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because the frisk is supposed to be limited to weapons, and seizing evidence of a different crime might be beyond its scope.\n\nLet me look up a case on this.\n\nI recall that in Minnesota v. Dickerson, the Supreme Court held that when an officer lawfully detains a person and feels an object during a frisk that he recognizes as contraband, he may seize it without probable cause or a warrant if it is immediately apparent to him that it is contraband.\n\nIn this case, the letter was felt during the frisk and recognized as a letter, which is not contraband per se, but it contained incriminating evidence.\n\nSo, maybe the officer could seize it because it was immediately apparent as evidence of a crime.\n\nBut, again, the frisk is supposed to be limited to weapons for officer safety, not for finding evidence.\n\nPerhaps the officer had to open the letter to realize it contained evidence of a crime, which would be a violation of Mark's privacy.\n\nWait, the scenario says that during the pat-down, the officer found the letter, which read: \"Dear Mark, If you could get rid of your brother permanently, we could be together forever. With love, your favorite girl.\"\n\nSo, it seems that the officer read the letter during the frisk, which seems invasive.\n\nHow could the officer have read the letter during the frisk? Did he open it?\n\nIf so, that might be a violation of Mark's privacy rights.\n\nGenerally, opening someone's mail without a warrant or consent is a violation of their privacy.\n\nTherefore, the seizure and reading of the letter might be unlawful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the letter was open and in Mark's pocket, and the officer saw it during the frisk.\n\nBut that seems unlikely. It's more probable that the letter was sealed or folded, and the officer opened it.\n\nIf that's the case, then the officer's action in opening and reading the letter would be unlawful, and the letter should be suppressed.\n\nSo, perhaps the letter was obtained through an illegal search and seizure, and therefore, it should be suppressed.\n\nBut, on the other hand, if the frisk was lawful and the letter was in plain view, then maybe it's admissible.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nLet me consider the options given:\n\nA. Admissible, because it was on the person, or in the presence of the person, who was later arrested.\n\nWell, Mark was later arrested, presumably, but was he arrested before or after the letter was found?\n\nIf he was arrested after the letter was found, then the letter wasn't on the person who was later arrested in connection with the arrest warrant for Bill.\n\nSo, this option doesn't seem to fit.\n\nB. Admissible, because it was obtained pursuant to a valid search.\n\nWas the search valid? The frisk was based on reasonable suspicion, and the seizure of the letter might have been pursuant to the plain view doctrine.\n\nBut, as I thought earlier, opening and reading the letter might have been beyond the scope of the frisk and therefore invalid.\n\nSo, I'm not sure about this option.\n\nC. Inadmissible, because the letter was obtained as a result of a non-consensual search and seizure.\n\nWell, the frisk was consensual in the sense that Mark allowed the officers in, but the frisk itself was based on reasonable suspicion, not consent.\n\nBut the seizure of the letter might have been non-consensual if it was beyond the scope of the frisk.\n\nSo, perhaps this is a valid reason to suppress the letter.\n\nD. Inadmissible, because the letter was the fruit of an illegal search and seizure.\n\nThis is similar to option C. If the seizure of the letter was illegal, then it's inadmissible as the fruit of the poisonous tree.\n\nSo, based on my analysis, it seems that the letter was obtained through an illegal search and seizure, and therefore, it should be suppressed.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure about the frisk and the plain view doctrine.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Suppose that during the frisk, the officer felt a letter in Mark's pocket and then opened it, reading its contents.\n\nWas that lawful?\n\nI don't think so. The frisk is for weapons, not for finding evidence of crimes.\n\nOpening the letter would be an additional search beyond the frisk, and without a warrant or probable cause, it's probably invalid.\n\nTherefore, the letter should be suppressed as the fruit of an illegal search and seizure.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
