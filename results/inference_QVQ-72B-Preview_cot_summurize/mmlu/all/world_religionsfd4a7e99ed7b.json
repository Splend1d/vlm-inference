Hmm, I think the Dalai Lama is quite old, so 2000 seems too recent. Let me think about this.\n\nI remember that the Dalai Lama is the spiritual leader of Tibet and is considered a bodhisattva in Buddhist tradition. He's been an advocate for nonviolence and human rights, and I think he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize at some point. But when was he born?\n\nLet me consider the years given. 1935 would make him around 86 years old, which seems plausible. 2000 would make him 21, which doesn't seem right for someone who has been leading for so long. 1965 would make him 56, and 1975 would make him 46. Given that he became the Dalai Lama in his youth, but still, 1965 or 1975 seems too recent.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about when he was recognized as the Dalai Lama. I think he was recognized in his childhood, around the age of 2 or 3, and then enthroned later. So if he was recognized in the 1940s, that would make his birth year around the late 1930s.\n\nLet me see if I can recall any specific dates. I think he was born in a small village in Tibet, and his name was Tenzin Gyatso. He's the 14th Dalai Lama, and I believe he was recognized in the 1940s, but I'm not sure about the exact year.\n\nConsidering that, if he was recognized in the 1940s, and he was born in the late 1930s, then 1935 seems possible. But let me double-check.\n\nI recall that he was born in 1935 in a village called Taktser, which is in northeastern Tibet. His family was farmers, and he was the fourth child of his parents. When he was a toddler, a search party identified him as the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama, and he was taken to Lhasa to be educated as the future Dalai Lama.\n\nSo, based on this, the birth year of 1935 makes sense. That would make him 86 years old in 2021, which aligns with his age now.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any possibility that the birth year could be later. If he was born in 1965, he would have been only around 10 years old when he assumed his role, which seems too young, even for a child prodigy. Wait, but I think the 14th Dalai Lama actually assumed full political power in Tibet at the age of 15, which would make sense if he was born in 1935 and assumed power in 1950.\n\nYes, that adds up. So, 1935 seems to be the correct birth year of the current Dalai Lama.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1935} \\]"
