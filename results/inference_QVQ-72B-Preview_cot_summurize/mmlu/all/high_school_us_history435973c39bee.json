We do not propose a division of wealth, but we do propose to limit poverty that we will allow to be inflicted on any man's family. We will not say we are going to try to guarantee any equality \u2026 but we do say that one third of the average is low enough for any one family to hold, that there should be a guarantee of a family wealth of around $5,000; enough for a home, an automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences, and the opportunity to educate their children.\u2026\nWe will have to limit fortunes. Our present plan is that we will allow no man to own more than $50,000,000. We think that with that limit we will be able to carry out the balance of the program.\n\u2014Senator Huey P.

                    "text": "Let's see here. This question is about Senator Huey P. Long's \"Share the Wealth Society\" in 1934, and why it attracted so many followers at that time. The options are:\n\nA. The New Deal had not ended the Great Depression.\n\nB. A flourishing economy and a baby boom had led people to desire greater incomes.\n\nC. The Second World War encouraged an egalitarian ethos.\n\nD. Socialistic ideas were becoming popular in the United States.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. In 1934, the United States was still deeply in the grips of the Great Depression. President Franklin D. Roosevelt had been elected in 1932 and had implemented the New Deal, which was a series of programs and reforms aimed at relieving the economic crisis. However, it's important to note that the New Deal was still in its early stages, and many Americans were still suffering from high unemployment, poverty, and economic hardship.\n\nSenator Huey P. Long was a prominent political figure at the time, known for his populist and progressive views. His \"Share the Wealth Society\" was a movement that proposed radical measures to redistribute wealth in the United States. According to the excerpt, the society aimed to limit both poverty and excessive wealth. It suggested guaranteeing a minimum family wealth of around $5,000, which would provide for basic necessities and education, while also capping individual fortunes at $50 million.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The New Deal had not ended the Great Depression.\n\nThis seems plausible. Even though the New Deal had started, its effects were not immediate, and the depression persisted. Frustration with the slow pace of recovery might have made people receptive to more radical solutions like Long's plan.\n\nB. A flourishing economy and a baby boom had led people to desire greater incomes.\n\nThis doesn't align with the historical context. The Great Depression was a period of economic downturn, not prosperity. The baby boom occurred after World War II, which was more than a decade later. So, this option is incorrect based on the timing.\n\nC. The Second World War encouraged an egalitarian ethos.\n\nAgain, timing is an issue here. The Second World War started in 1939 and ended in 1945, which is after 1934. Therefore, this couldn't have been a factor in the appeal of the \"Share the Wealth Society\" at that time.\n\nD. Socialistic ideas were becoming popular in the United States.\n\nThis is an interesting point. The 1930s saw a rise in socialist and communist ideas in the United States, largely in response to the failures of capitalism during the depression. However, it's important to note that while some socialistic ideas gained traction, the U.S. has traditionally been resistant to socialism.\n\nGiven these considerations, option A seems the most accurate. The New Deal, while a significant response to the depression, had not yet achieved its intended goals by 1934. As a result, many Americans were still struggling, and Long's proposals for wealth redistribution likely resonated with those who felt that the New Deal wasn't doing enough to alleviate their suffering.\n\nAdditionally, Long's plan promised a guarantee of a minimum standard of living, which would have been appealing to families living in poverty or near-poverty conditions. His limit on fortunes also addressed the issue of income inequality, which was a major concern during the depression era.\n\nIn summary, the primary reason for the appeal of the \"Share the Wealth Society\" in 1934 was that the New Deal had not yet ended the Great Depression, and people were looking for more immediate and comprehensive solutions to their economic hardships.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
