                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out for which value of n there are exactly two Abelian groups of order n up to isomorphism. The options are 4, 7, 8, and 12. I need to find out which one of these has exactly two different Abelian groups when we consider them up to isomorphism.\n\nFirst, I should recall what an Abelian group is. An Abelian group is a group where the operation is commutative, meaning that for any two elements a and b in the group, a * b = b * a.\n\nAlso, I need to remember that up to isomorphism means we consider groups that are structurally the same as the same, regardless of the names of their elements.\n\nSo, for each n in the options, I need to find all Abelian groups of order n and see which n has exactly two such groups.\n\nI think the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups will be helpful here. It says that every finite Abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. In other words, we can break down any Abelian group into a product of cyclic groups where the orders are prime powers.\n\nSo, for a given n, I need to find all possible direct products of cyclic groups of prime power orders that multiply to n.\n\nLet me start with n = 4.\n\nThe prime factorization of 4 is 2^2.\n\nSo, the possible Abelian groups of order 4 are:\n\n1. Cyclic group of order 4: C_4 or Z_4.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2: C_2 \u00d7 C_2 or Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2.\n\nThat's exactly two Abelian groups up to isomorphism. So, n = 4 seems to be a candidate.\n\nBut I need to check all the options to see which one has exactly two.\n\nNext, n = 7.\n\n7 is a prime number. The prime factorization is just 7^1.\n\nAbelian groups of order 7:\n\n1. Cyclic group of order 7: C_7 or Z_7.\n\nSince 7 is prime, there are no other direct products because the only divisors are 1 and 7. So, only one Abelian group up to isomorphism for n = 7.\n\nMoving on to n = 8.\n\n8 is 2^3.\n\nPossible Abelian groups:\n\n1. C_8 or Z_8.\n\n2. C_4 \u00d7 C_2.\n\n3. C_2 \u00d7 C_2 \u00d7 C_2.\n\nThat's three Abelian groups, so not exactly two.\n\nLastly, n = 12.\n\n12 factors into 2^2 \u00d7 3^1.\n\nWe need to consider all possible direct products of cyclic groups of these prime power orders.\n\nFirst, group the exponents:\n\n- For 2^2: possibilities are C_4 and C_2 \u00d7 C_2.\n\n- For 3^1: only C_3.\n\nNow, combine them:\n\n1. C_4 \u00d7 C_3 = C_{12}.\n\n2. C_2 \u00d7 C_2 \u00d7 C_3.\n\nBut C_2 \u00d7 C_3 = C_6, so this is C_2 \u00d7 C_6.\n\nWait, is there another combination?\n\nLet me think: since 12 is 2^2 \u00d7 3, and the exponents are 2 and 1, the possible groups are:\n\n1. C_{12}.\n\n2. C_6 \u00d7 C_2.\n\n3. C_4 \u00d7 C_3.\n\n4. C_2 \u00d7 C_2 \u00d7 C_3.\n\nBut actually, C_6 \u00d7 C_2 is isomorphic to C_4 \u00d7 C_3 because both have order 12, but let's check their structures.\n\nC_6 \u00d7 C_2: elements have orders dividing lcm(6,2)=6.\n\nC_4 \u00d7 C_3: elements have orders dividing lcm(4,3)=12.\n\nSo, C_6 \u00d7 C_2 has an element of order 6, while C_4 \u00d7 C_3 has an element of order 12. Therefore, they are not isomorphic.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1. C_{12} (cyclic group of order 12).\n\n2. C_6 \u00d7 C_2.\n\n3. C_4 \u00d7 C_3.\n\n4. C_2 \u00d7 C_2 \u00d7 C_3.\n\nThat's four distinct Abelian groups up to isomorphism for n = 12.\n\nSo, none of these options seem to have exactly two Abelian groups up to isomorphism. Wait, n = 4 had two, but n = 7 had one, n = 8 had three, and n = 12 had four.\n\nIs there a mistake in my reasoning?\n\nLet me double-check n = 4.\n\nn = 4: 2^2.\n\nPossible groups:\n\n1. C_4.\n\n2. C_2 \u00d7 C_2.\n\nYes, exactly two.\n\nn = 7: prime, only one group, C_7.\n\nn = 8: 2^3.\n\nPossible groups:\n\n1. C_8.\n\n2. C_4 \u00d7 C_2.\n\n3. C_2 \u00d7 C_2 \u00d7 C_2.\n\nYes, three groups.\n\nn = 12: 2^2 \u00d7 3.\n\nPossible groups:\n\n1. C_{12}.\n\n2. C_6 \u00d7 C_2.\n\n3. C_4 \u00d7 C_3.\n\n4. C_2 \u00d7 C_2 \u00d7 C_3.\n\nYes, four groups.\n\nSo, among the given options, only n = 4 has exactly two Abelian groups up to isomorphism.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 4} \\]"
