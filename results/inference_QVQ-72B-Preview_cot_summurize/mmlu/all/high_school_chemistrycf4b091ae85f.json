                    "text": "Let's see. I have this chemistry problem here. I need to figure out how many milliliters of 0.250 molar KOH will neutralize completely 50.0 milliliters of 0.150 molar H3PO4. Okay, so it's about acid-base neutralization. I remember that in such reactions, the number of moles of acid reacts with the number of moles of base based on their reaction stoichiometry.\n\nFirst, I should write down the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between KOH and H3PO4. KOH is a strong base, and H3PO4 is a polyprotic acid, meaning it can donate multiple protons. The balanced equation should show the correct stoichiometry.\n\nLet me think about the dissociation of H3PO4. In water, H3PO4 can donate three protons, but it's a weak acid, and its ionization occurs in steps. However, for the purpose of this problem, I think we can consider the overall reaction where H3PO4 reacts with KOH to form K3PO4 and water.\n\nSo, the balanced equation should be:\n\nH3PO4 + 3KOH \u2192 K3PO4 + 3H2O\n\nFrom this equation, the mole ratio of H3PO4 to KOH is 1:3. That means one mole of H3PO4 reacts with three moles of KOH.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the number of moles of H3PO4 present in 50.0 mL of 0.150 M solution.\n\nMolarity is defined as moles of solute per liter of solution.\n\nSo, moles of H3PO4 = (molarity) \u00d7 (volume in liters)\n\nVolume of 50.0 mL is 0.0500 L.\n\nMoles of H3PO4 = 0.150 mol/L \u00d7 0.0500 L = 0.0075 moles\n\nAccording to the stoichiometry, 1 mole of H3PO4 requires 3 moles of KOH.\n\nTherefore, moles of KOH required = 0.0075 moles \u00d7 3 = 0.0225 moles\n\nNow, I have to find out how many milliliters of 0.250 M KOH contain 0.0225 moles.\n\nAgain, molarity is moles per liter.\n\nSo, volume in liters = moles / molarity\n\nVolume of KOH = 0.0225 moles / 0.250 mol/L = 0.0900 L\n\nConvert liters to milliliters: 0.0900 L \u00d7 1000 mL/L = 90.0 mL\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 30.0 mL\n\nB. 27 mL\n\nC. 90.0 mL\n\nD. 270 mL\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 90.0 mL\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the balanced equation is H3PO4 + 3KOH \u2192 K3PO4 + 3H2O. That seems right.\n\nThen, calculating the moles of H3PO4: 0.150 M \u00d7 0.0500 L = 0.0075 moles. That's correct.\n\nStoichiometry: 1 mole H3PO4 needs 3 moles KOH, so 0.0075 moles H3PO4 \u00d7 3 = 0.0225 moles KOH.\n\nNow, for 0.250 M KOH, volume needed for 0.0225 moles is 0.0225 / 0.250 L = 0.0900 L, which is 90.0 mL.\n\nSeems correct. I don't see any errors in my calculations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
