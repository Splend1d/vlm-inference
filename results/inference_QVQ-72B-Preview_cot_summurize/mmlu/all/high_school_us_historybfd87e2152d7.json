Dangers and difficulties, instead of deterring, seemed to have a charm in his eyes.\u2026 He conceived, at the first moment of his landing in Mexico, the design of its conquest. When he saw the strength of its civilization, he was not turned from his purpose.\u2026 This spirit of knight-errantry might lead us to undervalue his talents as a general, and to regard him merely in the light of a lucky adventurer. But this would be doing him injustice; for Cortes was certainly a great general, if that man be one, who performs great achievements with the resources which his own genius has created. There is probably no instance in history, where so vast an enterprise has been achieved by means apparently so inadequate.\u2026 He brought together the most miscellaneous collection of mercenaries who ever fought under one standard: adventurers from Cuba and the Isles, craving for gold; hidalgos, who came from the old country to win laurels; \u2026 wild tribes of the natives from all parts of the country, who had been sworn enemies from their cradles, and who had met only to cut one another's throats, and to procure victims for sacrifice; men, in short, differing in race, in language, and in interests, with scarcely anything in common among them. Yet this motley congregation was assembled in one camp, compelled to bend to the will of one man, to consort together in harmony, to breathe, as it were, one spirit, and to move on a common principle of action!\n\u2014William Hickling Prescott, History of the Conquest of Mexico, 1843\nGiven the perspective of the passage above, William Hickling Prescott believed which of the following about the conquest of the Aztec Empire?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I'm reading this passage from William Hickling Prescott's \"History of the Conquest of Mexico,\" and I need to figure out what he believed about the conquest of the Aztec Empire based on this excerpt. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, Prescott describes Hernando Cortes as being deeply filled with the spirit of romantic enterprise, and that dangers and difficulties seemed to charm him rather than deter him. He also mentions that Cortes had the design of conquering Mexico from the moment he landed there, even when he saw the strength of its civilization, he didn't back down from his purpose. This suggests that Cortes was determined and perhaps even bold or daring in his ambitions.\n\nPrescott then talks about how Cortes might be seen as just a lucky adventurer, but argues that this would be unfair. He praises Cortes as a great general, emphasizing that he achieved great things with limited resources. This indicates that Prescott respects Cortes's military and leadership abilities.\n\nNext, Prescott describes the diverse and seemingly incompatible group of people that Cortes managed to assemble and lead. This included mercenaries from different backgrounds, hidalgos seeking glory, and native tribes who were traditional enemies. Despite their differences, Cortes managed to unite them under his command, fostering harmony and a common purpose.\n\nFrom this, it seems that Prescott admires Cortes's ability to lead such a diverse and potentially volatile group towards a shared goal.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. The actions of Hernando Cortes were irrational.\n\nBut from the passage, Prescott portrays Cortes as determined and skilled, not irrational. So, this doesn't seem to align with Prescott's view.\n\nB. The conquest of Mexico was a racist atrocity.\n\nThe passage doesn't mention racism or describe the conquest as an atrocity. It focuses more on Cortes's leadership and the challenges he overcame.\n\nC. Cortes was chiefly motivated by a desire for wealth.\n\nWhile the passage mentions that some of the mercenaries were craving for gold, it doesn't directly state that Cortes himself was primarily motivated by wealth. In fact, it suggests that Cortes was driven by a spirit of romantic enterprise and a desire for conquest, not just wealth.\n\nD. The Aztec Empire had to give way to the superior civilization of Spain.\n\nThis option implies a belief in the superiority of one civilization over another, which could be seen as a justification for conquest.\n\nLooking back at the passage, Prescott does mention that Cortes saw the strength of the Aztec civilization but was not deterred from his purpose of conquest. This might suggest that Prescott believed Spain's civilization was stronger or superior, but it's not explicitly stated.\n\nHowever, considering the context of the time when Prescott was writing (1843), it was a period when European and American cultures often viewed their own civilizations as superior to those they were conquering or colonizing.\n\nBut in this particular passage, Prescott primarily focuses on Cortes's leadership and the difficulties he overcame, rather than making a direct statement about the relative merits of Spanish and Aztec civilizations.\n\nGiven that, I'm a bit torn between options C and D.\n\nOption C suggests that Cortes was mainly motivated by a desire for wealth, but the passage also mentions that he was driven by a spirit of romantic enterprise and a desire for conquest, which might go beyond just seeking wealth.\n\nOption D suggests that the Aztec Empire had to give way to Spain's superior civilization, which might align with some implicit biases of the time, but it's not directly stated in the passage.\n\nPerhaps I need to look closer at the language used. Prescott refers to \"the strength of its civilization,\" which might imply that he recognized the Aztec civilization was strong, but Cortes still pursued conquest. This could suggest that Prescott believed Spanish civilization was stronger or more advanced, hence justifying the conquest.\n\nAdditionally, Prescott describes Cortes's assembly of a diverse group of people, including natives, which might indicate a belief in the superiority of Spanish leadership or organization.\n\nHowever, without more explicit language about the relative civilizations, it's hard to be entirely certain.\n\nLet me consider another angle. If Prescott believed that Cortes was a great general who achieved remarkable things with limited resources, and that he was able to unite such a diverse group, perhaps he saw the Spanish conquest as inevitable or necessary due to the supposed superiority of Spanish civilization.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Prescott was simply admiring Cortes's abilities without necessarily endorsing the idea of civilizational superiority.\n\nBut considering the historical context, it's likely that Prescott held some of the common views of his time regarding the superiority of European civilizations over indigenous ones.\n\nTherefore, I think option D is the closest to what Prescott believed based on this passage.\n\nSo, my answer is D. The Aztec Empire had to give way to the superior civilization of Spain.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
