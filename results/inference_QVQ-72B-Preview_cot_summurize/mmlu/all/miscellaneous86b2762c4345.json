                    "text": "So I remember there's this nursery rhyme about the days of the week and what each day's child will be like. The question is asking which child is full of woe based on the Mother Goose nursery rhyme. The options are Monday's child, Wednesday's child, Thursday's child, or Saturday's child.\n\nLet me try to recall the rhyme. I think it goes something like:\n\nMonday's child is fair of face,\n\nTuesday's child is full of grace,\n\nWednesday's child is full of woe,\n\nThursday's child has far to go,\n\nFriday's child is loving and giving,\n\nSaturday's child works hard for a living,\n\nAnd the child that is born on the Sabbath day\n\nIs bonny and blithe, and good and gay.\n\nOkay, so from what I can recall, Wednesday's child is full of woe. That seems to be the one that fits the description in the question.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me go through each option:\n\nA. Monday's child: Fair of face \u2013 that sounds positive, like they have a pleasant appearance. So, not full of woe.\n\nB. Wednesday's child: Full of woe \u2013 that seems to match exactly.\n\nC. Thursday's child: Has far to go \u2013 that might imply they have a lot to accomplish or face challenges, but it's not directly saying they're full of woe.\n\nD. Saturday's child: Works hard for a living \u2013 again, not indicating they're full of woe.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like Wednesday's child is the one described as full of woe.\n\nWait a minute, is there any variation in the rhyme that might change this? I think I've heard different versions before, but I can't remember them off the top of my head. Maybe I should check if there are any alternative verses that could affect the answer.\n\nLet me see, perhaps I can think of another version of the rhyme. Hmm, I think there's a longer version that includes more details about each day.\n\nLet me attempt to recite the longer version I've heard:\n\nMonday's child is fair of face,\n\nTuesday's child is full of grace,\n\nWednesday's child is full of woe,\n\nThursday's child has miles to go,\n\nFriday's child is loving and giving,\n\nSaturday's child works hard for a living,\n\nAnd the child born on Sunday is fair and wise and good and gracious.\n\nWait, now I'm a bit confused because in this version, Wednesday's child is still full of woe. So, it seems consistent with what I initially thought.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other version that might attribute \"full of woe\" to a different day's child.\n\nLet me think about this. I recall that in some variations, the traits might be slightly different, but I don't remember any significant changes to the core meanings.\n\nFor example, sometimes \"fair of face\" might be changed to \"fair and beautiful,\" but that's just a slight variation in phrasing. Similarly, \"full of grace\" might be \"graceful and charming.\"\n\nBut in all the versions I've come across, Wednesday's child remains \"full of woe.\" So, I think it's safe to say that Wednesday's child is the one described as full of woe.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can think about the possible meanings behind this rhyme. It seems like each day is associated with a particular characteristic, perhaps based on historical beliefs or superstitions about the influences of different days.\n\nFor instance, Monday is associated with fairness, Tuesday with grace, Wednesday with woe, and so on. It's interesting how Thursday's child has far to go, which might suggest they have a lot of potential or face many challenges in life.\n\nBut getting back to the question, it's clear that according to the standard Mother Goose nursery rhyme, Wednesday's child is full of woe.\n\nSo, my final answer would be B. Wednesday's child.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
