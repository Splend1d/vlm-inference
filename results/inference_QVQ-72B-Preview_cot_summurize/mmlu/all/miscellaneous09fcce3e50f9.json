                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Among these elements which one has the highest atomic mass? The options are A. Helium, B. Sodium, C. Uranium, D. Copper.\" Okay, I need to find out which of these elements has the highest atomic mass.\n\nFirst things first, I need to recall what atomic mass is. Atomic mass is essentially the mass of an atom of a particular element, and it's often expressed in atomic mass units (amu). Now, I know that different elements have different atomic masses based on the number of protons and neutrons in their atoms.\n\nI remember that helium is a light gas, often used in balloons, and it's one of the lightest elements. So, its atomic mass should be pretty low. Similarly, sodium is a metal that's commonly found in table salt, and copper is a metal used in wiring and coins. Uranium, on the other hand, sounds heavy; it's used in nuclear reactors and atomic bombs, so I have a feeling it's quite dense and heavy.\n\nBut intuition isn't everything, so I should look up the atomic masses of these elements to make sure I'm accurate.\n\nLet me start with helium. I think helium has an atomic mass of around 4 amu. Yeah, that sounds right because it's element number 2 on the periodic table, with two protons and usually two neutrons in its most common isotope.\n\nNext, sodium. Sodium is element number 11, and I recall its atomic mass is about 23 amu. So, that's higher than helium, as expected.\n\nThen, copper. Copper is element number 29, and I think its atomic mass is around 63.5 amu. So, that's significantly higher than sodium and helium.\n\nFinally, uranium. Uranium is element number 92, and I know it's one of the heaviest elements found naturally on Earth. Its atomic mass should be around 238 amu, which is much higher than copper, sodium, or helium.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the periodic table. As we move down the periodic table, elements generally have higher atomic masses because they have more protons and neutrons in their atoms.\n\nSo, helium is at position 2, sodium at 11, copper at 29, and uranium at 92. Clearly, uranium is the heaviest among these.\n\nI should also consider if there are any exceptions or special cases, but I don't think so. Each element has a distinct atomic mass based on its atomic structure, and uranium is known for being exceptionally heavy.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the actual masses of these atoms. Helium-4 has a mass of approximately 4.0026 amu, sodium-23 is about 22.9898 amu, copper is around 63.546 amu, and uranium-238 is about 238.05 amu.\n\nSo, mathematically, uranium has the highest atomic mass among these options.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there are any isotopes of these elements that might change this, but even then, uranium has isotopes with atomic masses exceeding 230 amu, which is still higher than copper or sodium.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Uranium.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Uranium}} \\]"
