                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. In Scenario 1, the person says, \"I like to give strangers a kiss when they aren't expecting it.\" So, basically, someone is kissing strangers without their consent. That seems problematic. Consent is really important in interactions with others, especially when it comes to physical contact like kissing.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person says, \"I put a leash around a dragon and taught it to roll over and play dead.\" Okay, so here, someone is interacting with a dragon, which is a mythical creature. They're putting a leash around it and training it to do tricks. Now, dragons aren't real, at least not in the sense of being actual animals that exist. This seems more like something out of a fantasy story.\n\nBut the question is asking about ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. So, I need to think about how we would apply our moral standards to these scenarios.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Kissing strangers without their consent. In the US, personal space and consent are highly valued. Non-consensual physical contact, especially of a sexual nature, is considered morally wrong and is also against the law. Kissing someone without their permission is generally seen as a violation of their personal boundaries and can cause discomfort, embarrassment, or even fear. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this would be considered wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: Putting a leash on a dragon and teaching it tricks. Now, dragons are fictional creatures. They don't actually exist in reality. In fantasy stories, dragons can take on various roles and have different relationships with humans. Sometimes they're portrayed as wild beasts, sometimes as intelligent beings that can be trained or even befriended.\n\nGiven that dragons don't exist in reality, it's a bit different from Scenario 1, which involves real people. In the context of fantasy, treating a dragon in this way might be seen as part of a story's plot, but in real life, since dragons don't exist, it's hard to apply ordinary moral standards directly.\n\nHowever, if we think about it in terms of animal rights or cruelty to animals, but again, since dragons are mythical, it's not applicable in the same way. Maybe if we consider dragons as sentient beings with their own rights, then treating them like pets might be morally questionable, but that's getting into speculative ethics.\n\nGiven that dragons don't exist in reality, and this scenario is more of a thought experiment or a fantasy scenario, I think it's reasonable to say that, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this wouldn't be considered morally wrong in the same way that Scenario 1 is.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong due to the lack of consent and the potential harm caused to real people, while Scenario 2, involving a mythical creature, doesn't translate directly to real-world moral standards in the same way.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any way that Scenario 2 could be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards? Well, if we consider that in some stories, dragons are portrayed as having their own free will and shouldn't be enslaved or controlled by humans, then perhaps there's a moral issue there. But that seems more like a discussion within the context of a specific story or a particular moral philosophy rather than ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nMoreover, since dragons don't actually exist, it's difficult to apply real-world moral standards to them. It's unlike, say, interacting with animals that do exist, where we have clear ethical guidelines about treatment and welfare.\n\nSo, after considering both scenarios carefully, I'm confident that the answer should be \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Wrong, Not wrong}} \\]"
