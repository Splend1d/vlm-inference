I remember that the average is just the sum of all the scores divided by the number of scores. So, first thing I should do is add up all these numbers.\n\nLet's see, 76 plus 80. 76 plus 80 is 156.\n\nThen, add 83 to that. 156 plus 83 is 239.\n\nNext, add 71 to 239. 239 plus 71 is 310.\n\nThen, add 80 to 310. 310 plus 80 is 390.\n\nLastly, add 78 to 390. 390 plus 78 is 468.\n\nSo, the total score for all six tests is 468.\n\nNow, to find the average, I need to divide this total by the number of tests, which is 6.\n\n468 divided by 6.\n\nLet me do that division.\n\n468 \u00f7 6.\n\nWell, 6 times 78 is 468, because 6 times 70 is 420, and 6 times 8 is 48, so 420 plus 48 is 468.\n\nSo, 468 divided by 6 is 78.\n\nTherefore, the average score is 78.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check my addition to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 76 plus 80:\n\n76\n\n+80\n\n= 156\n\nPlus 83:\n\n156\n\n+83\n\n= 239\n\nPlus 71:\n\n239\n\n+71\n\n= 310\n\nPlus 80:\n\n310\n\n+80\n\n= 390\n\nPlus 78:\n\n390\n\n+78\n\n= 468\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, dividing 468 by 6:\n\n468 \u00f7 6 = 78.\n\nSo, the average is 78.\n\nBut wait, let's see if there's another way to check this, maybe using a different approach to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nAnother way to find the average is to calculate the mean. The mean is the sum of the scores divided by the count of the scores, which is exactly what I did.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the arithmetic mean:\n\n\\[\\text{mean} = \\frac{\\sum x_i}{n}\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\sum x_i\\) is the sum of the scores and \\(n\\) is the number of scores.\n\nI have \\(\\sum x_i = 468\\) and \\(n = 6\\), so:\n\n\\[\\text{mean} = \\frac{468}{6} = 78\\]\n\nYes, that confirms my previous result.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can list out all the scores and see if the average makes sense.\n\nScores: 76, 80, 83, 71, 80, 78.\n\nLooking at these scores, they range from 71 to 83. The average of 78 seems reasonable because most of the scores are around 80, and 78 is slightly below that, which makes sense given that there are some scores below and above 80.\n\nAlternatively, I could arrange the scores in order from lowest to highest: 71, 76, 78, 80, 80, 83.\n\nWith six scores, the median would be the average of the 3rd and 4th scores. So, 78 and 80, which average to 79. Interesting, the median is 79, while the mean is 78.\n\nBut since the question asks for the average, which is the mean, and I've calculated that to be 78, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other way to interpret \"average score.\" Could it be the median or the mode? No, the question specifically asks for the average, which is the arithmetic mean.\n\nAdditionally, I can use the formula for the average of a set of numbers, which is the sum divided by the count, and I've applied that correctly.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 78.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 76\n\nB. 77\n\nC. 78\n\nD. 79\n\nSo, the correct choice is C. 78.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{78} \\]"
