                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about uncertainty in measurements. It says that two students drop a ball from rest from a known height and measure its speed just before it hits the ground. They've estimated that the uncertainty in the measured speed is 10 percent, and I need to find out what the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball is, assuming that the uncertainty in the ball's mass is negligible.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what kinetic energy is. Kinetic energy (KE) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ KE = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\(m\\) is the mass of the object and \\(v\\) is its velocity.\n\nNow, the problem states that the uncertainty in the ball's mass is negligible, so we can assume that any uncertainty in kinetic energy is primarily due to the uncertainty in the velocity measurement.\n\nWait, but kinetic energy depends on both mass and velocity squared, so even if mass has negligible uncertainty, the velocity is squared, which might amplify the uncertainty in velocity when propagated to kinetic energy.\n\nI think I need to use the concept of error propagation here. Specifically, for a function that depends on a variable raised to a power, there's a formula to relate the relative uncertainties.\n\nThe general formula for relative uncertainty in a function \\(f(x) = x^n\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta f}{f} = |n| \\cdot \\frac{\\delta x}{x} \\]\n\nBut in our case, kinetic energy is \\( KE = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2 \\), so it's proportional to \\(v^2\\). However, since mass is constant with negligible uncertainty, the uncertainty in KE should depend only on the uncertainty in \\(v^2\\).\n\nWait, but the formula above is for a single variable raised to a power. Here, KE is also multiplied by mass, but since mass has negligible uncertainty, I can focus on the \\(v^2\\) part.\n\nSo, the relative uncertainty in KE due to uncertainty in velocity can be approximated by:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta KE}{KE} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\delta v}{v} \\]\n\nBecause KE is proportional to \\(v^2\\), and the exponent is 2, so the relative uncertainty in KE is twice the relative uncertainty in velocity.\n\nGiven that the uncertainty in velocity is 10%, the uncertainty in KE should be \\(2 \\times 10\\% = 20\\%\\).\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA. 5%\n\nB. 10%\n\nC. 15%\n\nD. 20%\n\nSo, according to this calculation, the answer should be 20%.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nFirst, the kinetic energy is indeed \\( KE = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2 \\). If mass is constant with negligible uncertainty, then the uncertainty in KE is only due to the uncertainty in \\(v^2\\).\n\nThe relative uncertainty in \\(v^2\\) is twice the relative uncertainty in \\(v\\), because:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta(v^2)}{v^2} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\delta v}{v} \\]\n\nThis is a standard result from error propagation.\n\nTherefore, the uncertainty in KE should indeed be twice the uncertainty in velocity.\n\nGiven that, if the uncertainty in velocity is 10%, then the uncertainty in KE is 20%.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Perhaps I need to consider the uncertainty in mass, even if it's negligible. But the problem states that the uncertainty in mass is negligible, so it shouldn't affect the result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach to this problem.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Perhaps using the concept of percentage uncertainties.\n\nIf velocity has a 10% uncertainty, and kinetic energy depends on \\(v^2\\), then the uncertainty in KE would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{uncertainty in KE} = 2 \\times \\text{uncertainty in } v = 2 \\times 10\\% = 20\\% \\]\n\nThis seems consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the differential approach:\n\n\\[ d(KE) = \\frac{\\partial KE}{\\partial v} dv = m v dv \\]\n\nThen the relative uncertainty:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d(KE)}{KE} = \\frac{m v dv}{\\frac{1}{2} m v^2} = \\frac{2 dv}{v} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{dv}{v} \\]\n\nAgain, this confirms that the relative uncertainty in KE is twice that of velocity.\n\nSo, according to this, the answer should be 20%.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect this.\n\nWait a minute, the problem mentions that the ball is dropped from rest from a known height, and they measure the speed just before it strikes the ground.\n\nAssuming no air resistance or other energy losses, the initial potential energy should equal the final kinetic energy.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ mgh = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\]\n\nWhere \\(h\\) is the height, \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nIf there's uncertainty in \\(v\\), there's uncertainty in \\(KE\\), as before.\n\nBut perhaps the height has some uncertainty as well, which could propagate into the uncertainty in KE.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the height is known, so I assume that its uncertainty is negligible.\n\nIf that's the case, then the uncertainty in KE is indeed primarily due to the uncertainty in \\(v\\), as initially assumed.\n\nAlternatively, if there's uncertainty in \\(h\\), that would also introduce uncertainty in KE, but since it's stated that the height is known, I don't think that's relevant here.\n\nTherefore, sticking to the initial approach, the uncertainty in KE is 20%.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the options again:\n\nA. 5%\n\nB. 10%\n\nC. 15%\n\nD. 20%\n\nGiven the calculations and the standard error propagation formula, the answer should be 20%.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a different way to look at it.\n\nSuppose that the speed is measured with some uncertainty, say \\( \\delta v = 0.1 v \\).\n\nThen, the kinetic energy is:\n\n\\[ KE = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\]\n\nIf we consider a small change in velocity, \\( dv \\), then the change in KE is:\n\n\\[ d(KE) = m v dv \\]\n\nTherefore, the relative change in KE is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d(KE)}{KE} = \\frac{m v dv}{\\frac{1}{2} m v^2} = \\frac{2 dv}{v} = 2 \\times \\frac{dv}{v} \\]\n\nSo, again, this confirms that the relative uncertainty in KE is twice the relative uncertainty in velocity.\n\nHence, if \\( \\frac{dv}{v} = 10\\% \\), then \\( \\frac{d(KE)}{KE} = 20\\% \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 20%.\n\nI can't see any reason why it would be different.\n\nPerhaps to further confirm, let's consider an example with actual numbers.\n\nSuppose the ball is dropped from a height where its velocity is 10 m/s, with an uncertainty of 10%, i.e., \\( dv = 1 \\) m/s.\n\nThen, the kinetic energy is:\n\n\\[ KE = \\frac{1}{2} m (10)^2 = 50 m \\]\n\nThe uncertainty in KE due to the uncertainty in velocity would be:\n\n\\[ d(KE) = m \\times 10 \\times 1 = 10 m \\]\n\nTherefore, the relative uncertainty in KE is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d(KE)}{KE} = \\frac{10 m}{50 m} = 0.2 = 20\\% \\]\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the velocity is squared, and the uncertainty is 10%, then the uncertainty in \\(v^2\\) is indeed 20%, as squaring a quantity increases the relative uncertainty by a factor of 2.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 20%.\n\nBut since the problem is multiple-choice and 15% is also an option, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the students estimated the uncertainty in speed to be 10%, but speed is only one component of kinetic energy. Maybe there's another component contributing to the uncertainty in KE.\n\nBut no, as established earlier, if mass has negligible uncertainty, then the uncertainty in KE is only due to the uncertainty in velocity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a factor related to the measurement process or some other consideration.\n\nBut based on the information provided and standard error propagation principles, the answer should be 20%.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct answer is D. 20%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
