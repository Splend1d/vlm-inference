Hmm, I think I know the answer, but I want to make sure I'm not mixing things up.\n\nFirst off, I know that Mario is a famous character from Nintendo's Super Mario video game series. He's the main protagonist, and he has a brother who is also a playable character. Now, I need to recall what his brother's name is.\n\nLet me think about this. I remember that Mario's brother is taller and has a mustache, and he usually wears green instead of red. His name starts with an \"L,\" and it's not Louis or Luciano, at least not that I recall. Wait, maybe it is Luigi. Yeah, that sounds familiar.\n\nLet me double-check. I think Luigi was first introduced in the game Super Mario Bros., and he's been a recurring character ever since. He's known for being a bit taller and slimmer than Mario, and he has a deeper voice. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, I'll consider each option:\n\nA. Louis: I don't think so. Louis isn't a character in the Super Mario series. Maybe it's a common name, but in this context, it doesn't fit.\n\nB. Luigi: This seems spot on. As I mentioned earlier, Luigi is Mario's brother and a prominent character in the series.\n\nC. Luciano: Again, I don't recall this name being associated with Mario's brother. It might be a name somewhere in the franchise, but not as Mario's brother.\n\nD. Zelda: Well, Zelda is a different video game series altogether, isn't it? The Legend of Zelda is another famous Nintendo series, but that's separate from Super Mario. So, definitely not Mario's brother.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. Luigi. He's been a key figure in the Super Mario games, often appearing alongside Mario in various adventures and spin-off games like Mario Kart and Mario Bros.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I can think about some of the games where Luigi appears. For example, in Super Mario Bros. on the NES, Luigi was a selectable character with slightly different jumping abilities compared to Mario. Then, in later games like Super Mario 64, Luigi wasn't present, but he made a comeback in games like Super Mario Sunshine and Super Mario Galaxy. Plus, there are games entirely dedicated to Luigi, like Luigi's Mansion.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. I don't see any reason to doubt my initial thought. The name of Mario's brother in the Super Mario video games is indeed Luigi.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Luigi}} \\]"
