                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about finding the empirical formula of a compound based on its percentage composition. The compound is made up of 51.9% carbon, 4.86% hydrogen, and 43.2% bromine. I need to figure out which one of these options\u2014A. C7H5Br, B. C6H4Br3, C. C8H9Br, or D. C12H22Br\u2014is the correct empirical formula.\n\nFirst off, I remember that the empirical formula represents the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms of each element in a compound. So, to find it, I should start by converting the percentages of each element into grams, and then into moles, and finally find the simplest ratio of those moles.\n\nLet's assume I have 100 grams of the compound. That way, the percentages directly translate into grams:\n\n- Carbon: 51.9 g\n\n- Hydrogen: 4.86 g\n\n- Bromine: 43.2 g\n\nNext, I need to convert these grams into moles. I know the atomic masses are approximately:\n\n- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol\n\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol\n\n- Bromine (Br): 79.90 g/mol\n\nNow, I'll calculate the moles of each element:\n\nFor carbon:\n\n\\( \\text{moles of C} = \\frac{51.9 \\, \\text{g}}{12.01 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 4.32 \\, \\text{mol} \\)\n\nFor hydrogen:\n\n\\( \\text{moles of H} = \\frac{4.86 \\, \\text{g}}{1.008 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 4.82 \\, \\text{mol} \\)\n\nFor bromine:\n\n\\( \\text{moles of Br} = \\frac{43.2 \\, \\text{g}}{79.90 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 0.541 \\, \\text{mol} \\)\n\nNow, I need to find the ratio of these moles. To do that, I can divide each mole value by the smallest mole value, which is bromine's 0.541 mol.\n\nFor carbon:\n\n\\( \\frac{4.32}{0.541} \\approx 8.0 \\)\n\nFor hydrogen:\n\n\\( \\frac{4.82}{0.541} \\approx 8.9 \\)\n\nFor bromine:\n\n\\( \\frac{0.541}{0.541} = 1 \\)\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately C: 8, H: 9, Br: 1.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. C7H5Br\n\nB. C6H4Br3\n\nC. C8H9Br\n\nD. C12H22Br\n\nOption C seems to match the ratio I just calculated: C8H9Br.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the mole calculations:\n\n- C: 51.9 g / 12.01 g/mol = 4.32 mol\n\n- H: 4.86 g / 1.008 g/mol = 4.82 mol\n\n- Br: 43.2 g / 79.90 g/mol = 0.541 mol\n\nThen, dividing each by 0.541 mol:\n\n- C: 4.32 / 0.541 \u2248 8.0\n\n- H: 4.82 / 0.541 \u2248 8.9\n\n- Br: 0.541 / 0.541 = 1\n\nSo, the ratio is C:8, H:9, Br:1.\n\nOption C is C8H9Br, which matches this ratio.\n\nHowever, I should confirm if this is indeed the empirical formula by checking if there's any common factor that could reduce the formula further or if it's already in the simplest ratio.\n\nLooking at option C: C8H9Br. Is there a common factor among 8, 9, and 1? No, 8, 9, and 1 have no common factors other than 1, so this should be the empirical formula.\n\nBut let me just make sure about the other options to be certain.\n\nOption A: C7H5Br. That doesn't match our ratio of C:8, H:9, Br:1.\n\nOption B: C6H4Br3. This has Br3, but our calculation shows Br:1, so it doesn't match.\n\nOption D: C12H22Br. This seems to have higher numbers, suggesting it might be a multiple of the empirical formula, but since we're looking for the simplest ratio, C8H9Br is more appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: C8H9Br.\n\nJust to be thorough, perhaps I should consider if there's any experimental error or miscalculation in my steps, but based on the given percentages and the calculations, option C seems correct.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the empirical formula of the compound is C8H9Br.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
