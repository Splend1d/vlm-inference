                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a farmer testing a new fertilizer to see if it increases the mean weight of his apples. He's comparing it to the old fertilizer, which had a mean weight of 4.0 ounces per apple. He's setting up a hypothesis test with the null hypothesis (H0) that the mean weight is still 4.0 ounces and the alternative hypothesis (Ha) that the mean weight is greater than 4.0 ounces. He's using a 5% level of significance.\n\nHe takes a random sample of 16 apples and finds that the mean weight is 4.3 ounces with a standard deviation of 0.6 ounces. The problem asks for the p-value of this test, and gives four options:\n\nA. P(Z > 2)\n\nB. P(Z < 2)\n\nC. P(t > 2) with 15 degrees of freedom\n\nD. P(t < 2) with 15 degrees of freedom\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what a p-value is. The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.\n\nIn this case, the null hypothesis is that the mean weight \u03bc is 4.0 ounces, and the alternative is that \u03bc is greater than 4.0 ounces. Since the farmer is only interested in whether the mean has increased, this is a one-tailed test.\n\nNow, the sample size is 16 apples, the sample mean is 4.3 ounces, and the sample standard deviation is 0.6 ounces. The population standard deviation is not known, so we'll need to use the t-distribution instead of the Z-distribution.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem mentions that the weights are approximately normally distributed, which is good because that's one of the assumptions for using the t-test.\n\nSo, the test statistic we should use is the t-statistic, which is calculated as:\n\nt = (x\u0304 - \u03bc) / (s / \u221an)\n\nwhere x\u0304 is the sample mean, \u03bc is the population mean, s is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nt = (4.3 - 4.0) / (0.6 / \u221a16) = (0.3) / (0.6 / 4) = 0.3 / (0.15) = 2\n\nSo, the t-statistic is 2, with degrees of freedom df = n - 1 = 15.\n\nNow, since this is a one-tailed test (Ha: \u03bc > 4.0), the p-value is the area under the t-distribution with 15 degrees of freedom to the right of t = 2.\n\nTherefore, the p-value is P(t > 2) with 15 degrees of freedom.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. P(Z > 2)\n\nB. P(Z < 2)\n\nC. P(t > 2) with 15 degrees of freedom\n\nD. P(t < 2) with 15 degrees of freedom\n\nSo, option C seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. If I were to use the Z-distribution instead, which is incorrect here because the population standard deviation is unknown, I might calculate:\n\nZ = (x\u0304 - \u03bc) / (\u03c3 / \u221an)\n\nBut since \u03c3 is not known, using Z is not appropriate. The t-distribution is the right choice here.\n\nMoreover, in small samples (n < 30), the t-distribution is more accurate because it accounts for the additional uncertainty from estimating the population standard deviation.\n\nTherefore, the correct p-value is indeed P(t > 2) with 15 degrees of freedom.\n\nSo, the answer should be C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that another option could be correct. For example, if the problem was two-tailed, we might need to consider both tails, but it's clearly a one-tailed test here, as indicated by Ha: \u03bc > 4.0.\n\nAlso, option D is P(t < 2) with 15 degrees of freedom, which would correspond to the lower tail, but in this case, since we're testing for an increase, we're only interested in the upper tail probability.\n\nTherefore, option C is indeed the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
