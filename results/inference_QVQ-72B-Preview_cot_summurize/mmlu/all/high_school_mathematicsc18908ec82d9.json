                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: there are two equations, a parabola and a straight line, and they're supposed to intersect at only one point. The parabola is y1 = x\u00b2 + 2x + 7, and the line is y2 = 6x + b. I need to find the value of b that makes these two graphs touch at exactly one point.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for them to intersect at only one point. That means that the quadratic equation and the linear equation are equal at only one value of x. So, I should set y1 equal to y2 and solve for x.\n\nSo, set x\u00b2 + 2x + 7 equal to 6x + b:\n\nx\u00b2 + 2x + 7 = 6x + b\n\nNow, I'll rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side to make it easier to solve. Let's subtract 6x and b from both sides:\n\nx\u00b2 + 2x + 7 - 6x - b = 0\n\nSimplifying that:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4x + (7 - b) = 0\n\nSo, I have a quadratic equation: x\u00b2 - 4x + (7 - b) = 0\n\nFor the graphs to intersect at only one point, this quadratic equation must have exactly one real solution for x. That happens when the discriminant of the quadratic equation is zero. The discriminant, D, of a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0 is D = b\u00b2 - 4ac.\n\nIn my equation, a = 1, b = -4, and c = 7 - b. So, the discriminant is:\n\nD = (-4)\u00b2 - 4(1)(7 - b) = 16 - 4(7 - b)\n\nI need to set D equal to zero for only one solution:\n\n16 - 4(7 - b) = 0\n\nNow, let's solve for b.\n\nFirst, distribute the -4:\n\n16 - 28 + 4b = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-12 + 4b = 0\n\nNow, add 12 to both sides:\n\n4b = 12\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nb = 3\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I have c = 7 - b, and in the discriminant formula, it's c, so I think I did that correctly.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people get confused with the signs in the discriminant formula, so let me make sure. The standard quadratic equation is ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, and D = b\u00b2 - 4ac.\n\nIn my equation, x\u00b2 - 4x + (7 - b) = 0, so a = 1, b = -4, c = 7 - b. So, D = (-4)\u00b2 - 4(1)(7 - b) = 16 - 28 + 4b = -12 + 4b. Setting that equal to zero: -12 + 4b = 0 \u2192 4b = 12 \u2192 b = 3.\n\nThat seems correct. Let me think about what this means graphically. The parabola opens upwards, and the line has a slope of 6, which is steeper than the derivative of the parabola at the point of tangency.\n\nMaybe I should plug in b = 3 back into the equations and see if they intersect at only one point.\n\nSo, y2 = 6x + 3\n\nSet equal to y1: x\u00b2 + 2x + 7 = 6x + 3\n\nRearrange: x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 = 0\n\nNow, the discriminant is (-4)\u00b2 - 4(1)(4) = 16 - 16 = 0. Yes, exactly one solution, which confirms that they intersect at only one point.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's see what happens if b is different. Suppose b = 7, which is one of the options.\n\nThen y2 = 6x + 7\n\nSet equal to y1: x\u00b2 + 2x + 7 = 6x + 7\n\nRearrange: x\u00b2 - 4x = 0\n\nFactor: x(x - 4) = 0\n\nSo, x = 0 or x = 4. That's two solutions, meaning two intersection points. Not what we want.\n\nWhat if b = 12?\n\ny2 = 6x + 12\n\nSet equal to y1: x\u00b2 + 2x + 7 = 6x + 12\n\nRearrange: x\u00b2 - 4x - 5 = 0\n\nDiscriminant: (-4)\u00b2 - 4(1)(-5) = 16 + 20 = 36, which is positive, so two real solutions, again not one.\n\nAnd for b = 4:\n\ny2 = 6x + 4\n\nSet equal to y1: x\u00b2 + 2x + 7 = 6x + 4\n\nRearrange: x\u00b2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\nDiscriminant: (-4)\u00b2 - 4(1)(3) = 16 - 12 = 4, which is positive, so two real solutions.\n\nThus, only b = 3 gives exactly one solution.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the geometry of the situation. The line y2 = 6x + b is tangent to the parabola y1 = x\u00b2 + 2x + 7 at exactly one point. The slope of the tangent to the parabola is given by the derivative of y1 with respect to x.\n\nSo, y1' = 2x + 2\n\nSet this equal to the slope of the line, which is 6:\n\n2x + 2 = 6\n\n2x = 4\n\nx = 2\n\nNow, find y1 at x = 2:\n\ny1 = (2)\u00b2 + 2(2) + 7 = 4 + 4 + 7 = 15\n\nSo, the point of tangency is (2, 15). Now, plug these into the equation of the line y2 = 6x + b:\n\n15 = 6(2) + b\n\n15 = 12 + b\n\nb = 3\n\nThis confirms the earlier result.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the system of equations:\n\ny = x\u00b2 + 2x + 7\n\ny = 6x + b\n\nSet them equal:\n\nx\u00b2 + 2x + 7 = 6x + b\n\nRearrange:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4x + (7 - b) = 0\n\nFor exactly one solution, discriminant is zero:\n\n(-4)\u00b2 - 4(1)(7 - b) = 0\n\n16 - 28 + 4b = 0\n\n4b = 12\n\nb = 3\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently. So, the correct answer is b = 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
