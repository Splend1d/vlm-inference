So, we have two lists of book names, list1 and list2, and we need to create a new list called newList that contains all unique book names from both lists, sorted alphabetically.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each procedure does:\n\n1. **Sort(list)**: This sorts the list in alphabetical order and returns the sorted list.\n\n2. **Combine(list1, list2)**: This creates a new list that includes all elements from list1 followed by all elements from list2.\n\n3. **RemoveDuplicates(list)**: This removes any duplicate entries from the list so that each entry appears at most once.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n**Option A:**\n\n1. newList \u2190 Combine(list1, list2)\n\n2. newList \u2190 Sort(newList)\n\n3. newList \u2190 RemoveDuplicates(newList)\n\nSo, first, it combines both lists without sorting or removing duplicates initially. Then it sorts the combined list and finally removes duplicates.\n\nWait a minute, if I sort the list first and then remove duplicates, it should work, right? Let's think about this.\n\nSuppose list1 is [\"Macbeth\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Jane Eyre\"] and list2 is [\"Frankenstein\", \"Dracula\", \"Macbeth\", \"Hamlet\"].\n\nCombining them: [\"Macbeth\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Dracula\", \"Macbeth\", \"Hamlet\"]\n\nSorting: [\"Dracula\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Hamlet\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Macbeth\"]\n\nRemoving duplicates: [\"Dracula\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Hamlet\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Macbeth\"]\n\nSeems correct.\n\n**Option B:**\n\n1. list1 \u2190 Sort(list1)\n\n2. list2 \u2190 Sort(list2)\n\n3. newList \u2190 Combine(list1, list2)\n\n4. newList \u2190 RemoveDuplicates(newList)\n\nHere, both lists are sorted first, then combined, and finally duplicates are removed.\n\nUsing the same example:\n\nSort list1: [\"Frankenstein\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Macbeth\"]\n\nSort list2: [\"Dracula\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Hamlet\", \"Macbeth\"]\n\nCombine: [\"Frankenstein\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Macbeth\", \"Dracula\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Hamlet\", \"Macbeth\"]\n\nRemove duplicates: [\"Dracula\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Hamlet\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Macbeth\"]\n\nCorrect again.\n\n**Option C:**\n\n1. list1 \u2190 RemoveDuplicates(list1)\n\n2. list2 \u2190 RemoveDuplicates(list2)\n\n3. newList \u2190 Combine(list1, list2)\n\n4. newList \u2190 Sort(newList)\n\nIn this case, duplicates are removed from each list separately, then combined, and finally sorted.\n\nUsing the example:\n\nRemove duplicates from list1: [\"Macbeth\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Jane Eyre\"] \u2192 already no duplicates.\n\nRemove duplicates from list2: [\"Frankenstein\", \"Dracula\", \"Macbeth\", \"Hamlet\"] \u2192 no duplicates.\n\nCombine: [\"Macbeth\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Dracula\", \"Macbeth\", \"Hamlet\"]\n\nSort: [\"Dracula\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Hamlet\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Macbeth\"]\n\nCorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\n\n1. list1 \u2190 RemoveDuplicates(list1)\n\n2. list1 \u2190 Sort(list1)\n\n3. list2 \u2190 RemoveDuplicates(list2)\n\n4. list2 \u2190 Sort(list2)\n\n5. newList \u2190 Combine(list1, list2)\n\nThis option removes duplicates from each list separately, sorts them, and then combines them.\n\nUsing the example:\n\nRemove duplicates from list1: [\"Macbeth\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Jane Eyre\"] \u2192 no duplicates.\n\nSort list1: [\"Frankenstein\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Macbeth\"]\n\nRemove duplicates from list2: [\"Frankenstein\", \"Dracula\", \"Macbeth\", \"Hamlet\"] \u2192 no duplicates.\n\nSort list2: [\"Dracula\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Hamlet\", \"Macbeth\"]\n\nCombine: [\"Frankenstein\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Macbeth\", \"Dracula\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Hamlet\", \"Macbeth\"]\n\nNow, this combined list has duplicates (\"Frankenstein\" and \"Macbeth\" appear twice). But the problem is that the final newList should have unique entries. However, in this option, the newList is just the combined list without any further processing to remove duplicates.\n\nSo, if I follow the steps exactly as written, newList would be [\"Frankenstein\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Macbeth\", \"Dracula\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Hamlet\", \"Macbeth\"], which contains duplicates. That's not what we want.\n\nTherefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nNow, options A, B, and C all produce the correct result. But the question is to choose which code segment will correctly create newList. Since multiple options seem to work, I need to see if there's a difference in efficiency or if there's a better way.\n\nLet me think about the steps in each option:\n\n**Option A:**\n\n- Combine first: This merges both lists without sorting or removing duplicates.\n\n- Sort the combined list: This sorts the merged list, which may contain duplicates.\n\n- Remove duplicates: This removes any duplicates from the sorted list.\n\nThis sequence ensures that duplicates are handled after sorting, which might be efficient for sorting algorithms that can remove duplicates in a sorted list.\n\n**Option B:**\n\n- Sort each list separately.\n\n- Combine the sorted lists.\n\n- Remove duplicates from the combined list.\n\nThis is similar to option A but sorts each list before combining. This might be useful if the lists are already partially sorted or if there's a reason to sort them separately.\n\n**Option C:**\n\n- Remove duplicates from each list separately.\n\n- Combine the cleaned lists.\n\n- Sort the combined list.\n\nThis approach cleans the data first by removing duplicates from each list individually, then combines them, and finally sorts the result.\n\nAll these methods achieve the desired outcome, but perhaps one is more efficient than the others, or perhaps there's a specific reason to prefer one over the others based on the problem's constraints.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't specify any constraints regarding performance or specific requirements beyond creating the newList with unique, sorted entries, any of options A, B, or C would be correct.\n\nBut the question says \"which of the following code segments will correctly create newList,\" implying that there might be multiple correct options, but perhaps it's expecting to choose one.\n\nWait, looking back at the question: \"Which of the following code segments will correctly create newList?\"\n\nIt might be that multiple options are correct, but perhaps it's testing whether certain options are incorrect under certain circumstances.\n\nLet me check again:\n\nOption D is incorrect because it combines the sorted, deduplicated lists but doesn't remove duplicates from the combined list, leading to possible duplicates in newList.\n\nSo, option D is incorrect.\n\nBetween A, B, and C, all seem correct for different reasons:\n\n- Option A combines first, sorts, then removes duplicates.\n\n- Option B sorts each list separately, combines, then removes duplicates.\n\n- Option C removes duplicates from each list separately, combines, then sorts.\n\nAll these will produce the correct newList.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is to choose the most efficient or the best practice.\n\nIf I had to choose one, I might lean towards option C because removing duplicates from smaller lists first might be more efficient than removing them from a larger combined list. But in terms of correctness, all three options A, B, and C are correct.\n\nHowever, since the question likely expects a single best answer, and considering that removing duplicates from smaller lists first might be more efficient, I'd go with option C.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any potential issues with the other options.\n\nOption A: Combine first, then sort, then remove duplicates.\n\n- Combining first might lead to a larger list that needs to be sorted, which could be less efficient for large lists.\n\nOption B: Sort each list separately, combine, then remove duplicates.\n\n- Sorting each list separately and then combining and removing duplicates is similar to option A but with the advantage of having sorted lists before combining, which might make duplicate removal easier if the sorting is stable.\n\nOption C: Remove duplicates from each list separately, combine, then sort.\n\n- By removing duplicates from smaller lists first, we reduce the size of the lists being combined, which could be more efficient.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C seems like the most efficient approach, especially if the lists are large.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. list1 \u2190 RemoveDuplicates(list1)\n\nlist2 \u2190 RemoveDuplicates(list2)\n\nnewList \u2190 Combine(list1, list2)\n\nnewList \u2190 Sort(newList)"
