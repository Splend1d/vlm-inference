                    "text": "Let's see here. Goll Co. has investments in Rose Co. and Jave Co., with 25% and 18% interests respectively. Neither investment gives Goll significant influence over these companies' operating and financial policies. The question is asking which of these investments Goll should account for using the equity method.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the equity method is and when it should be applied. The equity method is typically used when an investor has significant influence over the investee. Significant influence is usually presumed when the investor owns between 20% and 50% of the voting shares of the investee.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that neither investment gives Goll the ability to exercise significant influence over either company's operating and financial policies. So, based on that, it seems like Goll shouldn't use the equity method for either investment.\n\nHowever, maybe there's more to it. Perhaps there are exceptions or other factors to consider. Let me think about this more carefully.\n\nThe equity method requires the investor to record its share of the investee's earnings or losses in its own income statement and to adjust the investment account for its share of the net assets of the investee. This method is intended to reflect the investor's influence over the investee.\n\nIn this case, Goll has a 25% interest in Rose and 18% in Jave, but it doesn't have significant influence over either company. Generally, significant influence is considered to start around 20%, but it's not solely based on the percentage ownership; other factors like representation on the board of directors, material transactions between the investor and investee, and the importance of the investment to the investee can also influence this determination.\n\nGiven that, if Goll doesn't have significant influence over Rose or Jave, it shouldn't use the equity method for either investment. Instead, it should likely use the cost method, where the investment is carried at cost and adjusted only for impairments or increases in ownership interest.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any possibility that Goll might still need to use the equity method for one of the investments.\n\nPerhaps there's a difference between the two investments that isn't immediately apparent. For example, maybe Goll has additional agreements or arrangements with Rose that give it more influence than just its ownership percentage suggests.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't provide any such information. It simply states that neither investment gives Goll the ability to exercise significant influence.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it seems that Goll should not use the equity method for either investment.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's something about the equity method that I'm missing. Let's double-check.\n\nAccording to accounting standards, the equity method should be used when the investor has significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. If that's not the case, then the cost method should be used instead.\n\nSo, since Goll doesn't have significant influence over either Rose or Jave, the answer should be D. Neither Rose nor Jave.\n\nBut let's see if there's any trick here. Maybe the fact that Goll has a 25% interest in Rose could somehow still require the use of the equity method, even without significant influence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a threshold below which the equity method isn't required, and above which it is, regardless of influence.\n\nBut no, that doesn't sound right. The equity method is primarily based on the ability to exert significant influence, not just on the ownership percentage.\n\nI think the straightforward answer is that since Goll doesn't have significant influence over either company, it shouldn't use the equity method for either investment.\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. Neither Rose nor Jave.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
