                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this problem about Adam Smith's pin factory and whether he should automate by buying this machine. The question is asking for the incremental cash outflow at time period 0, which is basically how much cash he needs to spend right now to start this project.\n\nFirst, I need to understand all the costs involved upfront. The machine costs $475,000, and there are additional costs for shipping and installation, which are $5,000. So, just adding those up, the total initial investment is $475,000 plus $5,000, which is $480,000.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that there aren't any other immediate costs. The problem mentions that there are annual savings from reduced scrap and labor costs starting from year 1, but those are savings, not initial outflows. Also, there's a salvage value at the end of the machine's life, but that's in the future, not at time 0.\n\nSo, at time 0, the only cash outlay seems to be the $475,000 for the machine plus $5,000 for shipping and installation, totaling $480,000.\n\nBut let me double-check. The machine has a useful life of 4 years and falls into the 3-year property class for MACRS depreciation. MACRS stands for Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System, which is a tax depreciation method. The depreciation rates for a 3-year property class are 33.33% in year 1, 44.45% in year 2, 14.81% in year 3, and 7.41% in year 4.\n\nHowever, depreciation is a non-cash expense, meaning it affects the tax shield but doesn't involve an actual cash payment. So, at time 0, when the machine is purchased, there might be some initial tax implications, but I think the actual cash outlay is just the purchase price plus shipping and installation.\n\nLet me see if there's any working capital involved. The problem doesn't mention any changes in working capital, so I'll assume that's not a factor here.\n\nAlso, the firm's marginal tax rate is 34%, which might be relevant for calculating tax savings from depreciation in future years, but again, that's not directly affecting the initial cash outflow.\n\nThe estimated final salvage value is $120,000, which is something that will happen at the end of the machine's useful life, so again, not part of the initial outlay.\n\nSo, based on this, the incremental cash outflow at time period 0 should be $480,000.\n\nWait a minute, let's look at the options:\n\nA. $280,000.00\n\nB. $380,000.00\n\nC. $480,000.00\n\nD. $580,000.00\n\nMy calculation suggests it's C. $480,000, but maybe there's something I'm missing. Perhaps there's a tax benefit at time 0 that reduces the initial outlay.\n\nLet me think about tax implications at time 0. If the machine is purchased and placed in service at time 0, then depreciation would start in year 1. So, in year 0, there's no depreciation expense yet. Therefore, the initial outlay should just be the cash paid for the machine and installation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an immediate expensing allowance or some tax credit that could reduce the initial cash outlay, but the problem doesn't mention any of that.\n\nI think the simplest and most straightforward answer is C. $480,000.00.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any net working capital involved. If the project requires inventory or accounts receivable, that would be an additional cash outlay. But the problem doesn't mention any of that, so I'll assume it's not necessary here.\n\nAlso, sometimes there are training costs or other setup expenses, but again, nothing is mentioned in the problem.\n\nTherefore, the incremental cash outflow at time period 0 is closest to C. $480,000.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
