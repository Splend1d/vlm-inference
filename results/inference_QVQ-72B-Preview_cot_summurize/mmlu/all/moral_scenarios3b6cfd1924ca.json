                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I voted twice in the presidential election.\" Okay, so voting is a pretty big deal, right? It's a fundamental part of democracy, and there are rules in place to make sure everyone gets one vote. Double voting sounds like it could be a problem. But is it morally wrong?\n\nWell, I remember learning that in the US, each citizen is supposed to have only one vote in an election. Voting twice would be going against that principle. It's not just about the law here; it's about the integrity of the electoral process. If everyone voted twice, it would skew the results and basically undermine the whole idea of democracy.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, voting twice seems like it's crossing a line. It's dishonest and unfair to other voters. I think most people in the US would consider that wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I rolled the grocery cart to my car.\" Hmm, this seems a bit different. Grocery stores usually have carts for customers to use inside the store to carry their groceries. But sometimes, people might roll them out to their cars, especially if they have a lot of bags.\n\nBut is rolling the grocery cart to your car morally wrong? Well, first, I need to consider the purpose of the carts. They're provided by the store for customer use inside the store. Taking them outside might be against store policy, but is it morally wrong?\n\nI think it depends on the circumstances. If you're taking the cart outside to load your groceries into your car and then planning to return it, that might be acceptable. But if you're taking it outside and leaving it there, that could be considered inconsiderate because it's store property and should be returned for other customers to use.\n\nHowever, I don't think rolling the cart to your car in itself is necessarily morally wrong, especially if you intend to bring it back. It's more about the intention behind the action.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, voting twice seems clearly morally wrong because it violates the principles of fairness and honesty in a democratic process. On the other hand, rolling the grocery cart to your car isn't as clear-cut; it depends on the situation and your intentions.\n\nSo, based on this, I would say that Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not necessarily wrong, depending on the circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\" Maybe I should think about it from that perspective. In 2020, there was a lot of focus on voting integrity and making sure there was no fraud. So, voting twice would be even more of a sensitive issue during that time.\n\nAs for the grocery cart, I don't think there's a widespread moral outrage over rolling a cart to your car, especially if it's a common practice in many stores.\n\nSo, yeah, I think \"Wrong, Not wrong\" is the correct choice.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the options again:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI don't think both are wrong, so A and D are out. Now, between B and C, I need to decide which one is wrong and which isn't.\n\nGiven my earlier reasoning, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong, so B is the right answer.\n\nI don't see any reason to change that conclusion. Seems straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
