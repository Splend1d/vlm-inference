                    "text": "Okay, so I'm trying to understand different patterns of attachment in children, especially this thing called insecure/anxious-avoidant attachment. It sounds a bit complicated, but I think I can figure it out.\n\nFirst off, attachment theory is about how children form bonds with their caregivers, usually their parents. There are different types of attachment patterns, and one of them is insecure/anxious-avoidant. From the name, it seems like these kids are both anxious and avoidant in their relationships with their caregivers.\n\nLet me see what each term means. \"Insecure\" probably means that the child doesn't feel safe or confident in the relationship with their parent. \"Anxious\" suggests that the child might be worried or uneasy about the relationship. \"Avoidant\" implies that the child tends to pull away or not seek closeness with the parent.\n\nSo, combining these, a child with an insecure/anxious-avoidant pattern might be uneasy about their relationship with their parent and may avoid or resist closeness.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Is very distressed when separated from his/her mother and continues to be highly anxious when she returns.\n\nThis sounds more like insecure/anxious-resistant attachment, where the child is very upset when the mother leaves and remains distressed when she comes back, almost as if they can't get close enough to her.\n\nB. Is more anxious when his/her mother is present than absent and resists contact with her when she returns following separation.\n\nThis seems similar to option A but emphasizes that the child is more anxious when the mother is present and actively resists contact when she returns.\n\nC. Is very distressed when separated from his/her mother but pulls away from her when she returns.\n\nThis also seems like a mix of being distressed at separation but then avoiding the mother upon her return.\n\nD. Shows little distress when separated from his/her mother and turns away from her when she returns.\n\nThis describes a child who doesn't show much upset when the mother leaves and then avoids her when she comes back.\n\nFrom what I recall, insecure/anxious-avoidant attachment is characterized by children who are uneasy about approaching their caregivers and may even seem to avoid them, especially after a separation. They might not show much distress when separated, but they also don't seek comfort when the caregiver returns.\n\nSo, option D seems to align with this description: showing little distress when separated and turning away when the mother returns.\n\nOption A sounds more like insecure/anxious-resistant attachment, where the child is very distressed at separation and remains anxious upon reunion.\n\nOption B seems similar to A, perhaps another way of describing the same pattern.\n\nOption C is interesting because it mentions being very distressed at separation but then pulling away when the mother returns. This could be a bit confusing because typically, in avoidant attachment, the child doesn't show much distress at separation.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a difference between avoidant and disorganized attachment. I need to make sure I'm not mixing them up.\n\nLet me recall: in avoidant attachment, children seem to avoid or ignore their caregivers, showing minimal distress when separated and minimal seeking of contact when reunited. In contrast, in resistant attachment, children are very distressed at separation and remain upset upon reunion, often seeking proximity but also showing anger or resistance.\n\nSo, based on this, option D seems to describe avoidant attachment accurately: little distress at separation and turning away upon reunion.\n\nOption C seems to suggest distress at separation but avoidance upon reunion, which might be more characteristic of disorganized attachment, where there's a conflict between seeking proximity and avoiding the caregiver.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up the specific behaviors associated with each type.\n\nLet me think about the Strange Situation test, which is often used to assess attachment patterns in infants. In this test, the mother leaves the room, and then returns, and the researcher observes the child's behavior.\n\nIn secure attachment, the child may be upset when the mother leaves but is comforted and happy when she returns.\n\nIn avoidant attachment, the child shows little reaction to the mother leaving or returning, almost as if they don't care.\n\nIn resistant attachment, the child is very upset when the mother leaves and remains upset when she returns, sometimes resisting comfort.\n\nIn disorganized attachment, the child may show a mix of approaching and avoiding behaviors, often appearing confused or contradictory in their actions.\n\nGiven this, option D seems to fit avoidant attachment: little distress at separation and turning away upon reunion.\n\nOption C mentions being very distressed at separation but pulling away when the mother returns, which might be more aligned with disorganized attachment.\n\nOptions A and B seem to describe resistant attachment, where the child is highly distressed at separation and remains anxious upon reunion, sometimes resisting contact.\n\nSo, if I had to choose the best description for insecure/anxious-avoidant attachment, I would go with option D: shows little distress when separated from his/her mother and turns away from her when she returns.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's any variation in how these attachments are described.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Maybe the child with avoidant attachment doesn't show much distress at separation because they've learned that seeking comfort from their caregiver isn't effective, so they've become independent and don't expect help.\n\nIn contrast, a child with resistant attachment is distressed at separation because they want comfort but don't receive it, leading to increased anxiety upon reunion.\n\nDisorganized attachment might involve both seeking and avoiding the caregiver, perhaps due to conflicting signals from the caregiver.\n\nGiven this, option D still seems to fit avoidant attachment best.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider an example. Imagine a toddler who doesn't cry when their mother leaves the room and doesn't go to her for comfort when she returns. This toddler seems indifferent or avoids interaction with the mother after separation. This sounds like avoidant attachment.\n\nOn the other hand, a toddler who cries loudly when the mother leaves and continues to be upset and resistant when she returns would have resistant attachment.\n\nAnother toddler might cry when the mother leaves but then avoid her upon return, perhaps indicating disorganized attachment.\n\nSo, based on this, option D is the correct choice for insecure/anxious-avoidant attachment.\n\nI think I've got it now. The key is understanding the differences between avoidant, resistant, and disorganized attachment patterns.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
