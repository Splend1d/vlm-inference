                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about circuits, specifically about combinational and sequential circuits. There are three statements, and I need to figure out which ones are true. The options are:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. II only\n\nC. I and II only\n\nD. II and III only\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what combinational and sequential circuits are.\n\nCombinational circuits are those where the output depends only on the current inputs. There's no memory involved; they don't have any feedback loops or storage elements. So, they're kind of instantaneous in their response to input changes.\n\nSequential circuits, on the other hand, do have memory. Their output depends not only on the current inputs but also on the past inputs or the sequence of inputs. They usually have some kind of storage elements like flip-flops or latches that hold the state of the circuit.\n\nNow, let's look at statement I: \"Combinational circuits may have feedback; sequential circuits do not.\"\n\nWait a minute, that seems counterintuitive. I thought combinational circuits weren't supposed to have feedback. If they did, wouldn't that make them sequential?\n\nLet me think about this. In combinational circuits, the signal flows only in one direction, from inputs to outputs, through logic gates. There shouldn't be any feedback paths because that would introduce memory, which isn't desired in combinational logic.\n\nSequential circuits, however, do have feedback paths. That's how they store information. For example, in a flip-flop, the output is fed back to the input to remember the state.\n\nSo, statement I seems incorrect because combinational circuits should not have feedback, and sequential circuits do.\n\nMoving on to statement II: \"Combinational circuits have a 'memoryless' property; sequential circuits do not.\"\n\nThis seems to align with what I know. Combinational circuits don't remember past inputs; they only care about the present inputs. Sequential circuits, however, do consider the past inputs or the sequence of inputs because they have memory elements.\n\nSo, this statement appears to be true.\n\nNow, statement III: \"Both sequential and combinational circuits must be controlled by an external clock.\"\n\nHmm, clocks are typically associated with sequential circuits, especially synchronous ones. In synchronous sequential circuits, all the storage elements are controlled by a common clock signal, which coordinates when changes to the state occur.\n\nCombinational circuits, however, don't require a clock. They respond immediately to input changes without needing a clock to synchronize their operations.\n\nSo, it's not necessary for combinational circuits to have an external clock. Therefore, statement III is false.\n\nBased on this, the correct answer should be B. II only.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Is there any chance that combinational circuits could have feedback under some circumstances?\n\nWell, in theory, if you have a combinational circuit with feedback, it would no longer be purely combinational because it would have memory. That sounds more like a sequential circuit.\n\nTherefore, it's safe to say that combinational circuits do not have feedback, and sequential circuits do.\n\nAlso, confirming that combinational circuits are memoryless, while sequential circuits are not, since they can store state.\n\nAnd finally, sequential circuits often require a clock to synchronize their operations, but combinational circuits do not need a clock.\n\nSo, yes, only statement II is true.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
