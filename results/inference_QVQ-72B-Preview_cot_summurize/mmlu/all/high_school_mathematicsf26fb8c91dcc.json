                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the problem says that five years ago, a computer that worked half as fast as a current computer cost twice as much money. And we need to find out what percent the current computer's speed to price ratio is of the older computer's speed to price ratio.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this clearer. Let's say:\n\n- Let the current computer's speed be \\(s\\) (say, in operations per second).\n\n- Therefore, the older computer's speed, being half as fast, would be \\( \\frac{s}{2} \\).\n\n- Let the current computer's price be \\(p\\) (say, in dollars).\n\n- Then, the older computer's price, being twice as much, would be \\(2p\\).\n\nNow, the speed to price ratio for the current computer would be \\( \\frac{s}{p} \\).\n\nAnd the speed to price ratio for the older computer would be \\( \\frac{s/2}{2p} = \\frac{s}{4p} \\).\n\nWe need to find out what percent \\( \\frac{s}{p} \\) is of \\( \\frac{s}{4p} \\).\n\nTo find this, we can set up the fraction \\( \\frac{ \\frac{s}{p} }{ \\frac{s}{4p} } \\) and then convert it to a percentage.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{ \\frac{s}{p} }{ \\frac{s}{4p} } = \\frac{s}{p} \\times \\frac{4p}{s} = 4 \\]\n\nSo, the current computer's speed to price ratio is 4 times that of the older computer's ratio.\n\nBut we need to express this as a percentage. So, 4 times is the same as 400%.\n\nWait a minute, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nIf the current ratio is \\( \\frac{s}{p} \\) and the older ratio is \\( \\frac{s}{4p} \\), then:\n\n\\[ \\frac{ \\frac{s}{p} }{ \\frac{s}{4p} } = 4 \\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the current ratio is 4 times the older ratio, which means 400% of the older ratio.\n\nBut let's see if there's any trick here that I might be missing.\n\nThe problem asks for the current computer's speed to price ratio as a percent of the older computer's speed to price ratio.\n\nGiven that:\n\n- Current speed to price ratio = \\( \\frac{s}{p} \\)\n\n- Older speed to price ratio = \\( \\frac{s/2}{2p} = \\frac{s}{4p} \\)\n\nSo, to find what percent the current ratio is of the older ratio, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{ \\text{current ratio} }{ \\text{older ratio} } \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{ \\frac{s}{p} }{ \\frac{s}{4p} } \\right) \\times 100\\% = 4 \\times 100\\% = 400\\% \\]\n\nThis seems consistent with what I calculated earlier.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of specific values to make it clearer.\n\nSuppose the current computer has a speed of 100 operations per second and costs $500.\n\nThen, the older computer, being half as fast, would have a speed of 50 operations per second and costs twice as much, so $1000.\n\nNow, the speed to price ratio for the current computer is \\( \\frac{100}{500} = 0.2 \\) operations per dollar.\n\nFor the older computer, it's \\( \\frac{50}{1000} = 0.05 \\) operations per dollar.\n\nNow, to find what percent 0.2 is of 0.05, we can set up the following:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{0.2}{0.05} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 4 \\times 100\\% = 400\\% \\]\n\nAgain, this confirms the earlier result.\n\nWait a second, but looking back at the options, option B is 400, which seems to match our calculation.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused because option D is \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\), which is 0.4, and that doesn't seem to align with our calculation.\n\nBut perhaps there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again carefully.\n\n\"Five years ago, a computer that worked half as fast as a current computer cost twice as much money. The current computer's speed to price ratio is what percent of the older computer's speed to price ratio?\"\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion in interpreting \"half as fast\" and \"twice as much.\"\n\nLet me ensure I'm interpreting this correctly.\n\nIf the older computer worked half as fast as the current one, that means its speed is half of the current computer's speed.\n\nAnd it cost twice as much as the current computer.\n\nSo, my initial setup seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes \"half as fast\" could be interpreted differently, but in this context, it should be straightforward.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the relationship between speed and price.\n\nGiven that speed is inversely proportional to price in this scenario.\n\nBut I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nPerhaps to avoid confusion, I can use another variable for the older computer's speed and price.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Current speed: \\(s\\)\n\n- Current price: \\(p\\)\n\n- Older speed: \\(s_o = \\frac{s}{2}\\)\n\n- Older price: \\(p_o = 2p\\)\n\nThen, the current speed to price ratio is \\( \\frac{s}{p} \\), and the older ratio is \\( \\frac{s_o}{p_o} = \\frac{s/2}{2p} = \\frac{s}{4p} \\).\n\nNow, to find what percent \\( \\frac{s}{p} \\) is of \\( \\frac{s}{4p} \\), we calculate:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{ \\frac{s}{p} }{ \\frac{s}{4p} } \\right) \\times 100\\% = 4 \\times 100\\% = 400\\% \\]\n\nThis reinforces that the answer is 400%.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any misinterpretation in the problem.\n\nIs there any other way to interpret \"half as fast\" or \"twice as much\"?\n\nFor example, sometimes, \"half as fast\" could imply that the older computer's speed is half of the current one, which is what I used.\n\nAnd \"cost twice as much\" means the older computer's price is twice the current one's price.\n\nSo, I think the interpretation is correct.\n\nPerhaps the confusion lies in whether we're comparing speed to price or price to speed, but given the problem's phrasing, it seems straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 400%, which corresponds to option B.\n\nBut since option D is \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\), which is 0.4, that might be a different approach or a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the options, but assuming that's not the case, 400% seems correct.\n\nSo, I'll conclude that the current computer's speed to price ratio is 400% of the older computer's speed to price ratio.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{400} \\]"
