                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about getting a protective order in a federal district court case. The plaintiff's attorney served the defendant with a summons, a complaint, and 25 interrogatories, asking for answers within 30 days. The question is, on which ground is the defendant likely to succeed in obtaining a protective order?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a protective order is. From what I recall, a protective order is a court order that limits the scope or manner of discovery to prevent unnecessary burden, expense, or harassment. So, the defendant is probably seeking to limit or modify the discovery requests made by the plaintiff.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Interrogatories are only proper to discover facts, not contentions.\n\nI need to check if interrogatories can be used to discover contentions. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 33, interrogatories are a tool for discovering facts relevant to the case. Contentions might be more related to the parties' legal positions or arguments. Maybe the defendant is arguing that interrogatories aren't the right way to ask about their legal contentions.\n\nBut, I think interrogatories can be used to ask about contentions to some extent, especially if those contentions are based on factual information. So, I'm not sure if this is a strong ground for a protective order.\n\nB. Interrogatories may not be served until an answer to the complaint is filed.\n\nI need to recall the timing of discovery in federal court. Generally, unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, parties may serve discovery requests after the complaint has been served, but before an answer is filed.\n\nWait, actually, under FRCP 26(d), unless a different time is set by the court or the parties agree otherwise, parties may serve discovery requests after the complaint has been served, but before an answer is filed.\n\nSo, the plaintiff served the interrogatories with the summons and complaint, which seems to be allowed. Maybe the defendant is arguing that interrogatories can't be served until after an answer is filed, but that doesn't seem right based on the rules.\n\nC. Interrogatories may not be served until the parties have conferred to arrange for initial disclosures and prepare a discovery plan.\n\nThis relates to the meet-and-confer requirement under FRCP 26(f), where the parties are supposed to meet and confer to discuss the nature and basis of their claims and defenses, the possibilities for promptly settling the case or reaching an agreement on how it may be resolved without trial, and to develop a proposed discovery plan.\n\nThis conference is supposed to take place early in the litigation process, generally within 21 days after service of the complaint upon any defendant, or sooner if ordered by the court.\n\nSo, perhaps the defendant is arguing that until this meet-and-confer has happened, interrogatories can't be served.\n\nBut, according to FRCP 26(d)(1), unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, a party may serve a request for discovery upon any other party without a conference under Rule 26(f).\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. Let me check.\n\nFRCP 26(f) requires the parties to meet and confer to discuss discovery and other pretrial matters, and the court must then hold a scheduling conference.\n\nHowever, FRCP 26(d)(1) says that unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, a party may serve a request for discovery upon any other party without awaiting the entry of a scheduling order.\n\nSo, it seems that a party can serve discovery requests before the scheduling order is issued, which typically follows the meet-and-confer.\n\nTherefore, the plaintiff served the interrogatories with the summons and complaint, which is allowed under the rules.\n\nSo, this might not be a valid ground for a protective order.\n\nD. The interrogatories exceed the number permitted without permission from the court or an agreement between the parties.\n\nUnder FRCP 33(a)(1), unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, a party may serve upon any other party no more than 25 written questions, including all subparts, per discovery request.\n\nSo, the plaintiff served 25 interrogatories, which is right at the limit. But, the defendant might be arguing that this exceeds the number permitted.\n\nWait, 25 is exactly the limit. So, unless there's something unusual, serving exactly 25 interrogatories shouldn't be a problem.\n\nBut maybe the defendant is arguing that some of these interrogatories have subparts that make the total exceed 25.\n\nHowever, without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nBut, based on the information given, it says \"25 interrogatories asking questions about the defendant's contentions in the case,\" and they are to be answered within 30 days.\n\nAssuming that each interrogatory has only one question, then it's within the limit. If there are subparts, then it might exceed the limit, but that's speculative.\n\nGiven that, I think option D is a possible ground for a protective order if the interrogatories exceed the 25-question limit, but based on the information provided, it seems that 25 interrogatories are allowed.\n\nSo, none of the options seem to perfectly fit as a likely successful ground for a protective order based on the information provided.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nOption A: Interrogatories are only proper to discover facts, not contentions.\n\nBut, interrogatories can be used to discover facts that underlie a party's contentions. So, if the defendant's contentions are based on certain facts, interrogatories are an appropriate way to discover those facts.\n\nTherefore, this doesn't seem like a strong ground.\n\nOption B: Interrogatories may not be served until an answer to the complaint is filed.\n\nBut, according to FRCP 26(d), unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, a party may serve a request for discovery upon any other party without awaiting the entry of a scheduling order.\n\nSo, serving interrogatories before an answer is filed is allowed.\n\nOption C: Interrogatories may not be served until the parties have conferred to arrange for initial disclosures and prepare a discovery plan.\n\nAgain, while the meet-and-confer is required under FRCP 26(f), serving discovery requests before that conference is allowed under FRCP 26(d).\n\nOption D: The interrogatories exceed the number permitted without permission from the court or an agreement between the parties.\n\nBut, according to FRCP 33(a)(1), a party may serve up to 25 written questions, including all subparts, per discovery request.\n\nIn this case, it's 25 interrogatories, which is the limit.\n\nUnless some of these interrogatories have subparts that make the total exceed 25, which isn't indicated in the question, this doesn't seem like a valid ground.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is none of the above, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding.\n\nLet me consider that the defendant might argue that serving interrogatories this early is premature.\n\nBut, according to the rules, it's allowed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the defendant is arguing that the interrogatories are unduly burdensome or seek irrelevant information, but that's not specified in the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the interrogatories are about the defendant's contentions.\n\nMaybe the defendant is arguing that such contentions should be disclosed through initial disclosures under FRCP 26(a)(1), which requires a party to disclose, among other things, the nature and basis of its claims or defenses and the computation of any category of damages claimed.\n\nInitial disclosures are due soon after service of the complaint and must be made without awaiting further discovery.\n\nSo, perhaps the defendant is arguing that contentions should be disclosed through initial disclosures, not through interrogatories.\n\nBut, interrogatories can still be used to discover facts related to those contentions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the defendant is arguing that interrogatories are not the proper method to discover contentions, but rather requests for admissions under FRCP 36 might be more appropriate.\n\nHowever, that's not one of the options.\n\nGiven that, I think the best answer is D: The interrogatories exceed the number permitted without permission from the court or an agreement between the parties.\n\nEven though, based on the information provided, it seems that 25 interrogatories are allowed, perhaps there's an implication that some of these interrogatories have subparts, making the total number of questions exceed 25.\n\nFor example, if Interrogatory 1 has 5 subparts, that counts as 5 questions, and so on.\n\nIf that's the case, then the defendant might argue that the total number of questions exceeds 25, thus requiring court permission or an agreement between the parties to allow more than 25 questions.\n\nHowever, the question states that there are 25 interrogatories \"asking questions about the defendant's contentions in the case,\" and they are to be answered within 30 days.\n\nIt doesn't specify how many subparts each interrogatory has, so assuming each interrogatory has only one question, it's within the limit.\n\nTherefore, unless there's more to it, I don't think option D is valid based on the given information.\n\nPerhaps the question is trying to trick me into thinking that 25 interrogatories equal 25 questions, but in reality, each interrogatory can have multiple subparts, counting as additional questions.\n\nIf that's the case, then yes, the interrogatories might exceed the 25-question limit, providing a ground for a protective order.\n\nBut, the question doesn't specify that.\n\nTherefore, I'm going to go with option D as the most plausible ground for a protective order, assuming that the interrogatories have subparts that push the total number of questions beyond 25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
