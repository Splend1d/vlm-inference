                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this baseball term. The question is: what is the baseball term for a batter who substitutes for another batter? The options are A. Switchhitter, B. Shadow hitter, C. Clip hitter, and D. Pinch hitter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each term means in the context of baseball, especially regarding batters substituting for one another.\n\nStarting with option A: Switchhitter. I recall that a switch hitter is a batter who can bat both left-handed and right-handed, depending on the pitcher. So, they can switch their batting side based on the pitcher's throwing hand. For example, if a right-handed pitcher is pitching, the batter might choose to bat left-handed, or vice versa. But this doesn't seem to involve substituting for another batter. It's more about the batter's ability to hit from both sides.\n\nOption B: Shadow hitter. Hmm, I'm not familiar with this term in baseball. Maybe it's not a standard term in the sport. Perhaps it's a mistranslation or a typo.\n\nOption C: Clip hitter. Again, I'm not sure what this refers to in baseball. It doesn't sound like a standard position or role related to batting substitutions.\n\nOption D: Pinch hitter. Now, this sounds familiar. I think a pinch hitter is a substitute batter who comes in to bat for another player, usually during a specific inning or situation. The term \"pinch\" suggests that they're brought in at a crucial moment, maybe when the team needs to score runs urgently.\n\nLet me double-check this. In baseball, teams have lineups with designated batters for each position, but sometimes coaches might want to replace a scheduled batter with a better option, especially if the situation calls for a specific type of hit, like a home run or a bunt.\n\nSo, if a manager decides to send in a different player to bat in place of the one who is supposed to bat next, that substitute is called a pinch hitter. Once the pinch hitter has batted, they typically stay in the game in the field, taking the position of the player they replaced.\n\nThis seems to match the description of the question perfectly. Therefore, I believe the correct answer is D. Pinch hitter.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there are any other roles or terms in baseball that involve a batter substituting for another batter. Besides pinch hitters, there are pinch runners, who substitute for a base runner, but that's not related to batting.\n\nThere are also defensive substitutions, where fielders are replaced, but again, that doesn't involve batting.\n\nSo, no, those don't fit the description. Therefore, the answer should be D. Pinch hitter.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
