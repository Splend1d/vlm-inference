As the present sciences are useless for the discovery of effects, so the present system of logic is useless for the discovery of the sciences.\nXIX. There are and can exist but two ways of investigating and discovering truth. The one hurries on rapidly from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from them, as principles and their supposed indisputable truth, derives and discovers the intermediate axioms. This is the way now in use. The other constructs its axioms from the senses and particulars, by ascending continually and gradually, till it finally arrives at the most general axioms, which is the true but unattempted way.\nXXII. Each of these two ways begins from the senses and particulars, and ends in the greatest generalities&\u2026\nXXXVI. We have but one simple method of delivering our sentiments, namely, we must bring men to particulars and their regular series and order, and they must for a while renounce their notions, and begin to form an acquaintance with things.\"\nFrancis Bacon, English philosopher and essayist, Novum Organum, 1620\nThe method of inquiry elucidated by Francis Bacon in the passage is known as\n\nA. humanism\nB. deduction\nC. empiricism\nD. scientific socialism\n"

                    "text": "So I'm reading this passage from Francis Bacon's \"Novum Organum,\" and he's talking about different ways of investigating and discovering truth. He mentions two main approaches: one that starts from senses and particulars and rushes quickly to the most general axioms, and another that also starts from senses and particulars but gradually builds up to the most general axioms through a step-by-step process.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these terms mean. Axioms are like self-evident truths or starting points in reasoning. Particulars refer to specific observations or instances. So, the first method jumps from specific observations directly to very general principles, and then derives everything in between from those principles. The second method takes a more gradual approach, building up from specifics to generals step by step.\n\nBacon seems to prefer the second method, calling it the \"true but unattempted way.\" He also says that the first method is the one in use at the time, which suggests that he's critiquing the prevailing methods of his era.\n\nNow, the question is asking what this method of inquiry is known as. The options are humanism, deduction, empiricism, and scientific socialism.\n\nLet me recall what each of these terms means:\n\n- **Humanism:** This is a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings, placing humans at the center of moral and intellectual concerns. It's more about ethics and the value of human experience rather than a method of inquiry.\n\n- **Deduction:** This is a form of logical reasoning where conclusions are derived from general principles or premises. It's a top-down approach, starting from general axioms and deriving specific instances.\n\n- **Empiricism:** This is a philosophical approach that emphasizes the role of experience, especially sensory experience, in the formation of ideas. It suggests that knowledge comes from sensory data and observation.\n\n- **Scientific socialism:** This term is associated with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who used it to describe their theory of social change based on historical materialism and class struggle. It's more about a socio-economic theory rather than a general method of inquiry.\n\nLooking back at Bacon's passage, he emphasizes starting from the senses and particulars and building up to general axioms gradually. This sounds a lot like empiricism, which values sensory experience as the foundation of knowledge.\n\nDeduction, on the other hand, starts from general principles and derives specific instances, which seems to align more with the first method Bacon criticizes.\n\nHumanism is more about ethical and human-centered values, not specifically a method of inquiry.\n\nScientific socialism is entirely unrelated to the context of Bacon's work in \"Novum Organum.\"\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is C. empiricism.\n\nBut let me double-check. Bacon was a key figure in the scientific revolution, advocating for the use of inductive reasoning, which involves making generalizations based on specific observations. This inductive method is indeed a cornerstone of empiricism.\n\nIn contrast, deduction is more aligned with rationalism, which was also present during Bacon's time but was criticized by empiricists like Bacon for relying too heavily on abstract reasoning without sufficient empirical basis.\n\nSo, yes, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. empiricism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
