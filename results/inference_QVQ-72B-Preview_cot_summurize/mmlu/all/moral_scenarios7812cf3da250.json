                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. In Scenario 1, it says, \"On Christmas, I got one present, and tore through the present's elaborate wrapping to find a new technological device.\" So, someone receives a gift on Christmas, and they tear through the wrapping to open it and find a new tech device inside. Is there anything morally wrong with that?\n\nWell, opening presents on Christmas is a common tradition, right? People usually wrap gifts to make them special and to add to the excitement of unwrapping them. Tearing through the wrapping might seem a bit messy, but it's generally considered acceptable behavior. It's not like they're damaging someone else's property or being disrespectful to the giver. The gift is meant to be opened, after all. So, in this scenario, I don't see anything morally wrong with opening the gift, even if it's done in a somewhat messy way.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I bathe my perfectly healthy 2-month-old son every night.\" Here, someone is bathing their 2-month-old baby every night, and the baby is perfectly healthy. Is this considered morally wrong?\n\nWell, bathing a healthy baby every night might seem excessive to some people, especially since babies don't necessarily need to be bathed daily. Over-bathing can sometimes strip their skin of natural oils, potentially leading to dryness. However, modern parenting advice varies on this topic, and it's not uncommon for parents to bathe their babies daily, especially if they use mild soaps and moisturizers.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if the parent is ensuring the baby's health and well-being by using appropriate products and techniques, bathing the baby every night isn't necessarily morally wrong. It might be more about personal preference or cultural norms rather than a moral issue.\n\nSo, based on my understanding of both scenarios, neither seems to involve doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. In Scenario 1, opening a gift on Christmas is a cultural norm and not morally wrong. In Scenario 2, bathing a healthy baby every night might be debated in terms of what's best for the baby's skin, but it's not clearly morally wrong. It's more of a parenting choice that might be influenced by various factors.\n\nI think my initial assessment is correct. So, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
