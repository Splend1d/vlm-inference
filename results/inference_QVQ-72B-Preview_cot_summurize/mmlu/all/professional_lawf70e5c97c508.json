                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario. It's about a trial where the defendant is accused of receiving stolen property, specifically a stolen stereo. There's an informer who testified that the defendant sold him this stereo, and that the defendant knew it was stolen. During the direct examination, the informer mentioned that he's unemployed but sometimes works part-time as a substitute teacher. Then, on cross-examination, the defendant's attorney asked if the informer had recently applied to become a police officer, and the informer said yes. Following that, the defense attorney asked whether it's true that the informer hopes that by acting as an undercover agent, the police department will overlook his two misdemeanor convictions for possession of marijuana. The prosecuting attorney objected to this question.\n\nNow, I need to determine whether the defense attorney's inquiry about the informer's hopes and misdemeanor convictions is proper or improper, and choose from four options:\n\nA. Improper, as evidence of conduct not related to truthfulness.\n\nB. Improper, as relating to convictions of crimes not punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year.\n\nC. Proper, as tending to show the informer's bad character for truthfulness.\n\nD. Proper, as relevant to the informer's possible bias.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand the rules of evidence regarding the impeachment of a witness, particularly an informer in this case.\n\nI recall that witnesses can be impeached, or their credibility can be challenged, in several ways. One common way is by showing that they have a bias or interest in the outcome of the case that might affect their testimony. Another way is by attacking their character for truthfulness, often through prior inconsistent statements or prior bad acts, including convictions.\n\nIn this scenario, the informer has testified against the defendant, and the defense is trying to undermine his credibility. The defense attorney is questioning the informer about his application to become a police officer and his hope that his prior misdemeanor convictions for marijuana possession will be overlooked in exchange for his cooperation as an undercover agent.\n\nLet's consider the options one by one.\n\nOption A says the inquiry is improper because it's about conduct not related to truthfulness. But wait, the informer's hope that his convictions will be overlooked in exchange for his cooperation seems directly related to his motivation for testifying. If he's testifying in hopes of getting favorable treatment regarding his prior convictions, that could affect his truthfulness. He might be inclined to lie or exaggerate to please the police or prosecution in order to have his convictions overlooked. So, this seems relevant to his truthfulness.\n\nOption B says it's improper because the convictions are for misdemeanors not punishable by more than one year in prison. I need to check the rules about impeaching a witness with prior convictions. Generally, in many jurisdictions, a witness can be impeached with evidence of a criminal conviction, especially felonies. However, some jurisdictions allow impeachment with misdemeanor convictions under certain conditions, such as if they relate to truthfulness or if they carry a penalty of imprisonment exceeding one year.\n\nIn this case, the misdemeanors are for possession of marijuana, which might or might not carry a sentence exceeding one year, depending on the jurisdiction. But without knowing the specific law, it's hard to say. Maybe the key point here is that they are misdemeanors, not felonies, and thus may not be admissible for impeachment purposes unless they involve dishonesty or false statement.\n\nOption C says the inquiry is proper as tending to show the informer's bad character for truthfulness. Well, having misdemeanor convictions for possession of marijuana doesn't necessarily speak directly to truthfulness unless the convictions involved dishonesty. Possession of marijuana is generally not a crime that involves lying or dishonesty; it's more about possession of a controlled substance. So, unless there's something specific about these convictions that relates to truthfulness, using them to attack character for truthfulness might be a stretch.\n\nOption D says the inquiry is proper as relevant to the informer's possible bias. This seems plausible. If the informer is hoping that his cooperation will lead the police to overlook his prior convictions, that could create a bias in his testimony. He might be motivated to please the prosecution or the police to get a better deal regarding his own situation. Therefore, this could be a valid ground for impeachment.\n\nConsidering all this, I think Option D is the most accurate. The defense attorney's question about the informer's hopes and misdemeanor convictions is proper because it's relevant to the informer's possible bias in testifying against the defendant.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it differently. Suppose the informer had no prior convictions and was testifying solely based on his observations. In that case, his motivation might be different. But here, knowing that he has prior convictions and is hoping for favorable treatment in exchange for his cooperation, that could indeed affect his objectivity and truthfulness in testifying.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that he's applying to become a police officer might make him more eager to please the police department, which could further bias his testimony in favor of the prosecution.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I believe the correct answer is D: proper, as relevant to the informer's possible bias.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
