                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about meteorites with high metal content. It asks whether they are:\n\nA. Pieces of comets rather than of asteroids.\n\nB. Chunks of large differentiated asteroids that were shattered by collisions.\n\nC. Chunks of rock chipped off the planet Mars.\n\nD. Leftover chunks of rock from the earliest period in the formation of the solar system.\n\nHmm, I need to recall some information about meteorites and their origins.\n\nFirst off, meteorites are basically rocks from space that reach the Earth's surface. They can come from different places in the solar system, like asteroids or even other planets.\n\nNow, the question is specifically about meteorites that have a high metal content. So, these are probably mostly made up of metals like iron and nickel.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A suggests they are pieces of comets rather than asteroids. Comets are typically composed of ice, dust, and rocks. They are known for their icy composition, and while they do contain some metals, I don't think they're primarily metallic. So, if a meteorite has a high metal content, it's probably not from a comet.\n\nOption B says they are chunks of large differentiated asteroids that were shattered by collisions. Differentiated asteroids are interesting because, due to their size, they can undergo differentiation, where heavier materials like metals sink to the center, and lighter materials like silicates rise to the surface. So, the core of such an asteroid would be rich in metals like iron and nickel. If a collision fragments one of these asteroids, pieces from the core could be ejected into space and eventually reach Earth as meteorites with high metal content. This seems plausible.\n\nOption C mentions chunks of rock chipped off the planet Mars. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a metallic core, similar to Earth's. So, if pieces were ejected from Mars, they could contain metals. However, I think that most meteorites from Mars are believed to be igneous rocks, not primarily metallic. Plus, the process of ejecting material from Mars due to impacts would likely launch more superficial, less metallic material into space.\n\nOption D refers to leftover chunks of rock from the earliest period in the formation of the solar system. These would be primitive materials that didn't accrete into larger bodies. While some of these could be metallic, I don't think they are necessarily high in metal content compared to other types of meteorites.\n\nGiven these considerations, option B seems the most likely answer. Large differentiated asteroids have distinct layers, including a metallic core. When these asteroids are impacted, pieces from the core can be ejected and eventually fall to Earth as meteorites rich in metals like iron and nickel.\n\nLet me just double-check this. I recall that iron meteorites are thought to come from the cores of asteroids that have been differentiated. There's even a famous asteroid called Psyche, which is believed to be mostly metal and may be the exposed core of a protoplanet that was fragmented by impacts.\n\nSo, yeah, I think option B is correct. Chunks of large differentiated asteroids that were shattered by collisions are most likely to be meteorites with high metal content.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
