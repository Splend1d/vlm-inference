                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: I need to find the value of this expression: -1 over -3, multiplied by 1 over (1 over -3). That's a mouthful. Let me write it down to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nIt's written as: -1/-3 \u2022 1/(1/-3)\n\nFirst, I need to simplify each part of the expression step by step.\n\nStarting with -1/-3:\n\nWhen you divide two negative numbers, the result is positive. So, -1 divided by -3 is positive 1/3.\n\nSo, -1/-3 = 1/3\n\nNext, 1/(1/-3):\n\nThis is a bit trickier. I have to divide 1 by 1/-3. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So, dividing by 1/-3 is the same as multiplying by -3/1.\n\nTherefore, 1/(1/-3) = 1 * (-3/1) = -3\n\nNow, putting it all together, the original expression simplifies to:\n\n1/3 * -3\n\nMultiplying these together: 1/3 * -3 = -1\n\nWait a minute, but looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 1\n\nB. -1\n\nC. 0\n\nD. 2\n\nSo, -1 is one of the options. But just to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as:\n\n-1/-3 * 1/(1/-3)\n\nFirst, -1/-3 is 1/3, as established.\n\nAnd 1/(1/-3) is indeed -3, because dividing by 1/-3 is equivalent to multiplying by -3.\n\nSo, 1/3 * -3 = -1\n\nYeah, that matches.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other interpretation of the expression.\n\nIs there any possibility of the expression being misread? For example, could the parentheses be interpreted differently?\n\nLet me read it again: Find -1 over -3 multiplied by 1 over (1 over -3).\n\nSo, it's clear that it's -1/-3 \u2022 1/(1/-3)\n\nAnd I've simplified it to 1/3 \u2022 -3 = -1\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can combine the operations.\n\nStarting with -1/-3 \u2022 1/(1/-3)\n\nI can write this as:\n\n(-1) / (-3) \u2022 1 / (1 / -3)\n\nWhen multiplying fractions, I can multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:\n\n(-1) * 1 / (-3) * (1 / -3)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-1 / (-3 * (1 / -3))\n\nSimplifying the denominator:\n\n-3 * (1 / -3) = -3 / -3 = 1\n\nSo, -1 / 1 = -1\n\nAgain, I get -1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simplify the second fraction first:\n\n1 / (1 / -3) = -3, as previously determined.\n\nThen, -1/-3 = 1/3, and 1/3 * -3 = -1\n\nSame result.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any context or special case that might change this.\n\nFor example, if there are complex numbers involved, but no, it's just real numbers here.\n\nOr if there's any misinterpretation of the fractions, but the expression is pretty straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the options provided, but assuming that's not the case.\n\nSo, based on the calculations, the answer should be -1, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-1} \\]"
