                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about truck weights being normally distributed. It says that 70% of the trucks weigh more than 12,000 pounds, and 80% weigh more than 10,000 pounds. I need to find the mean (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3) for the weights of these trucks. There are four options provided, and I have to pick the correct one.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what it means for data to be normally distributed. In a normal distribution, the data is symmetrically distributed with the mean at the center, and the empirical rule tells us about the percentages within certain standard deviations from the mean. But here, I don't have the mean or standard deviation, but I do have some percentages and corresponding weights.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. I have two pieces of information:\n\n1. P(X > 12,000) = 0.70\n\n2. P(X > 10,000) = 0.80\n\nWhere X is the weight of a truck, assumed to be normally distributed.\n\nI need to find \u03bc and \u03c3.\n\nSince X is normally distributed, I can standardize the values to find their z-scores. The z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nI can find the z-scores corresponding to the given probabilities.\n\nFirst, for P(X > 12,000) = 0.70, that means P(X < 12,000) = 0.30.\n\nSimilarly, for P(X > 10,000) = 0.80, so P(X < 10,000) = 0.20.\n\nI can look up these cumulative probabilities in the standard normal table to find the corresponding z-scores.\n\nLet me find the z-scores for cumulative probabilities of 0.30 and 0.20.\n\nFor P(Z < z) = 0.30, the z-score is approximately -0.52.\n\nFor P(Z < z) = 0.20, the z-score is approximately -0.84.\n\nSo, I have:\n\nz1 = (12,000 - \u03bc) / \u03c3 = -0.52\n\nz2 = (10,000 - \u03bc) / \u03c3 = -0.84\n\nNow, I have two equations with two variables, \u03bc and \u03c3.\n\nLet me write them down clearly:\n\nEquation 1: (12,000 - \u03bc) / \u03c3 = -0.52\n\nEquation 2: (10,000 - \u03bc) / \u03c3 = -0.84\n\nI can solve this system of equations to find \u03bc and \u03c3.\n\nFirst, let's rearrange both equations to express (\u03bc - 12,000) and (\u03bc - 10,000) in terms of \u03c3.\n\nEquation 1: (12,000 - \u03bc) = -0.52\u03c3 \u2192 (\u03bc - 12,000) = 0.52\u03c3\n\nEquation 2: (10,000 - \u03bc) = -0.84\u03c3 \u2192 (\u03bc - 10,000) = 0.84\u03c3\n\nNow, let's subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\n(\u03bc - 10,000) - (\u03bc - 12,000) = 0.84\u03c3 - 0.52\u03c3\n\nSimplify:\n\n\u03bc - 10,000 - \u03bc + 12,000 = 0.32\u03c3\n\nSo, 2,000 = 0.32\u03c3\n\nNow, solve for \u03c3:\n\n\u03c3 = 2,000 / 0.32 = 6,250\n\nNow that I have \u03c3, I can plug it back into one of the equations to find \u03bc.\n\nLet's use Equation 1:\n\n(\u03bc - 12,000) = 0.52 * \u03c3\n\n\u03bc - 12,000 = 0.52 * 6,250\n\n\u03bc - 12,000 = 3,250\n\n\u03bc = 12,000 + 3,250 = 15,250\n\nWait a minute, none of the options have \u03bc = 15,250 and \u03c3 = 6,250. The closest option is B. \u03bc = 15,100; \u03c3 = 6,200.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a rounding error. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, I found z-scores for P(Z < 0.30) and P(Z < 0.20), which I took as -0.52 and -0.84, respectively. Looking back at standard normal tables, P(Z < 0.30) is approximately -0.52, and P(Z < 0.20) is approximately -0.84. That seems correct.\n\nThen, I set up the equations:\n\n(12,000 - \u03bc)/\u03c3 = -0.52 \u2192 (\u03bc - 12,000)/\u03c3 = 0.52\n\n(10,000 - \u03bc)/\u03c3 = -0.84 \u2192 (\u03bc - 10,000)/\u03c3 = 0.84\n\nSubtracting the first from the second:\n\n(\u03bc - 10,000 - \u03bc + 12,000)/\u03c3 = 0.84 - 0.52\n\nWhich simplifies to 2,000/\u03c3 = 0.32\n\nSo, \u03c3 = 2,000 / 0.32 = 6,250\n\nThen, \u03bc - 12,000 = 0.52 * 6,250 = 3,250\n\nSo, \u03bc = 15,250\n\nBut this isn't exactly matching any of the options. Maybe the options have some rounding applied.\n\nLooking at option B: \u03bc = 15,100; \u03c3 = 6,200\n\nThat's close to my calculation. Maybe the z-scores I used were approximate, and more precise values would lead to one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the z-scores corresponding to exact probabilities might differ slightly from my estimates.\n\nLet me try to use more precise z-scores.\n\nUsing a standard normal table or calculator, P(Z < z) = 0.30 corresponds to z \u2248 -0.5244\n\nSimilarly, P(Z < z) = 0.20 corresponds to z \u2248 -0.8416\n\nNow, plug these into the equations:\n\nEquation 1: (12,000 - \u03bc)/\u03c3 = -0.5244 \u2192 (\u03bc - 12,000)/\u03c3 = 0.5244\n\nEquation 2: (10,000 - \u03bc)/\u03c3 = -0.8416 \u2192 (\u03bc - 10,000)/\u03c3 = 0.8416\n\nSubtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\n(\u03bc - 10,000 - \u03bc + 12,000)/\u03c3 = 0.8416 - 0.5244\n\n2,000/\u03c3 = 0.3172\n\nSo, \u03c3 = 2,000 / 0.3172 \u2248 6,304\n\nThen, from Equation 1:\n\n\u03bc - 12,000 = 0.5244 * \u03c3\n\n\u03bc - 12,000 = 0.5244 * 6,304 \u2248 3,302\n\n\u03bc = 12,000 + 3,302 \u2248 15,302\n\nAgain, this is close to option C: \u03bc = 15,300; \u03c3 = 6,300\n\nPerhaps the exact answer is \u03bc \u2248 15,300 and \u03c3 \u2248 6,300, which corresponds to option C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the z-scores I used are still approximate, and more precise values would lead to option C.\n\nLet me check with even more precise z-scores.\n\nUsing a calculator, P(Z < z) = 0.30 corresponds to z \u2248 -0.5244\n\nP(Z < z) = 0.20 corresponds to z \u2248 -0.8416\n\nWait, earlier I had z \u2248 -0.5244 and -0.8416, which seems consistent.\n\nRe-calculating:\n\n\u03c3 = 2,000 / (0.8416 - 0.5244) = 2,000 / 0.3172 \u2248 6,304\n\nThen, \u03bc = 12,000 + (0.5244 * 6,304) \u2248 12,000 + 3,302 \u2248 15,302\n\nSo, rounding to the nearest hundred, \u03bc = 15,300 and \u03c3 = 6,300, which is option C.\n\nBut let's verify with another approach to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that for a normal distribution, the z-scores correspond uniquely to the cumulative probabilities.\n\nGiven that, and using the precise z-scores, I can set up the equations more accurately.\n\nLet me denote z1 = (12,000 - \u03bc)/\u03c3 and z2 = (10,000 - \u03bc)/\u03c3\n\nGiven that P(Z > z1) = 0.70 and P(Z > z2) = 0.80, which translates to P(Z < -z1) = 0.70 and P(Z < -z2) = 0.80.\n\nFrom standard normal tables, P(Z < -z) = 1 - P(Z < z), but in this case, since we have P(Z < -z), we can directly find the z-scores.\n\nLooking up P(Z < z) = 0.70 gives z \u2248 -0.5244\n\nSimilarly, P(Z < z) = 0.20 gives z \u2248 -0.8416\n\nSo, z1 \u2248 0.5244 and z2 \u2248 0.8416\n\nNow, set up the equations:\n\n(\u03bc - 12,000)/\u03c3 = 0.5244\n\n(\u03bc - 10,000)/\u03c3 = 0.8416\n\nSubtract the first from the second:\n\n(\u03bc - 10,000 - \u03bc + 12,000)/\u03c3 = 0.8416 - 0.5244\n\n2,000/\u03c3 = 0.3172\n\nThus, \u03c3 = 2,000 / 0.3172 \u2248 6,304\n\nThen, \u03bc = 12,000 + (0.5244 * 6,304) \u2248 12,000 + 3,302 \u2248 15,302\n\nSo, rounding to the nearest hundred, \u03bc = 15,300 and \u03c3 = 6,300, which corresponds to option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider using the average of the two equations to find \u03bc.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to use the fact that both z-scores correspond to the same mean and standard deviation.\n\nGiven two equations:\n\n1. (12,000 - \u03bc)/\u03c3 = -0.5244\n\n2. (10,000 - \u03bc)/\u03c3 = -0.8416\n\nLet me solve both for \u03bc:\n\nFrom equation 1: \u03bc = 12,000 - 0.5244\u03c3\n\nFrom equation 2: \u03bc = 10,000 - 0.8416\u03c3\n\nSet them equal:\n\n12,000 - 0.5244\u03c3 = 10,000 - 0.8416\u03c3\n\nSolve for \u03c3:\n\n12,000 - 10,000 = -0.8416\u03c3 + 0.5244\u03c3\n\n2,000 = -0.3172\u03c3\n\n\u03c3 = 2,000 / 0.3172 \u2248 6,304\n\nThen, plug back to find \u03bc:\n\n\u03bc = 12,000 - 0.5244 * 6,304 \u2248 12,000 - 3,302 \u2248 15,302\n\nAgain, this confirms \u03bc \u2248 15,300 and \u03c3 \u2248 6,300, which is option C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: \u03bc = 15,300; \u03c3 = 6,300.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
