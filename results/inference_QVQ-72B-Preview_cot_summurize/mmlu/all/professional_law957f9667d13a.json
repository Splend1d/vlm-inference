                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this scenario about a lawsuit being removed from state court to federal court, and I need to figure out if that was properly done. So, a woman from State A is suing a retailer in State B's court, saying the retailer didn't deliver $100,000 worth of goods she paid for. The retailer, which is incorporated in State C and has its main office in State B, filed a notice to remove the case to federal court in State B, twenty days after being served.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall the rules for removing a case to federal court. I know that generally, cases can be removed if there's diversity of citizenship and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. So, let's check those points.\n\nThe woman is from State A, and the retailer is incorporated in State C and has its principal place of business in State B. For diversity purposes, the citizenship of the parties matters. So, the plaintiff is from State A, and the defendant is from State B and State C, right? Because for corporations, citizenship includes both the state of incorporation and the state where its principal place of business is located.\n\nWait, actually, I think that's correct. So, the retailer is a citizen of both State B and State C.\n\nNow, the amount in controversy is $100,000, which is more than $75,000, so that requirement is met.\n\nBut, there's also a timing issue here. The retailer filed the notice of removal twenty days after being served. Is that timely?\n\nI recall that the notice of removal must be filed within 30 days after the defendant receives the initial pleading or other paper from which it can first be ascertained that the case is removable. So, if the retailer was served with the complaint and filed the removal notice within 30 days, that seems okay. Twenty days is less than 30, so that should be fine.\n\nBut, there's also something about the one-year limit if the case becomes removable after it's been filed. But in this case, it seems like the case was always removable from the start, so that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nSo, based on that, it seems like the removal was proper because there's diversity of citizenship and the amount in controversy is met, and the timing is within the required period.\n\nBut, let's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because the notice of removal was not timely filed.\n\nBut, according to my calculation, twenty days is within the 30-day window, so that shouldn't be a problem.\n\nB. No, because the retailer is a citizen of State B.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. The retailer is a citizen of both State B and State C, but the plaintiff is from State A. For diversity jurisdiction, all plaintiffs must be from different states than all defendants. Since the retailer is a citizen of State B, and the plaintiff is from State A, and no other parties are involved, does that create a problem?\n\nWait, I think that as long as there is complete diversity, meaning all plaintiffs are from different states than all defendants, then it's okay. Here, the plaintiff is from State A, and the defendant is from State B and State C. So, there is complete diversity.\n\nC. Yes, because the parties are citizens of different states and more than $75,000 is in controversy.\n\nThis seems to be stating the correct reasons for why the removal is proper. So, this could be the right answer.\n\nD. Yes, because the retailer is a citizen of both State B and State C.\n\nWell, that's true, but it's not the primary reason. The primary reason is diversity jurisdiction based on different citizenship between plaintiff and defendant and the amount in controversy.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is C. Yes, because the parties are citizens of different states and more than $75,000 is in controversy.\n\nBut, just to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nFirst, diversity jurisdiction requires complete diversity between all plaintiffs and all defendants, and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.\n\nHere, the plaintiff is from State A, and the defendant is from State B and State C. No overlap, so complete diversity exists.\n\nThe amount is $100,000, which is above the threshold.\n\nThe timing of the removal notice was within 30 days, which is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the action was properly removed to federal court.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
