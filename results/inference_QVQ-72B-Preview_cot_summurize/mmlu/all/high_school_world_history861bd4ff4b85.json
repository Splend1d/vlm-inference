It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called \"cardinals\"? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.\n\u2014Martin Luther, Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation\nWhich of the following reformers expressed views similar to those expressed by Martin Luther in his letter above?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Martin Luther's views, and it's asking which other reformer expressed similar views based on his letter \"Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation.\" I need to read through the options and see who among Ulrich Zwingli, Sir Thomas More, Erasmus, or John Wycliffe had similar ideas to Luther in this particular work.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what Luther was saying in this letter. From the excerpt, he seems to be addressing the Christian nobility in Germany, suggesting that he's trying to rally support for reform within the Church. He mentions that he's compiled some points about reforming the Christian estate, and he's presenting them to the nobility.\n\nHe also mentions that he isn't doing this out of arrogance but because of the distress and misery\u538b\u8feb all Christian estates, especially in Germany. So, he's responding to a crisis he sees in the Church and society.\n\nLuther criticizes the Romanists, likely the Roman Catholic Church authorities, for protecting themselves with three walls:\n\n1. That the temporal power has no jurisdiction over spirituality.\n\n2. That no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.\n\n3. That no one may call a council but the Pope.\n\nHe seems to be arguing that these positions have prevented reform and led to the decline of Christendom.\n\nHe also criticizes the lifestyle of the Pope and the cardinals, saying that the Pope lives in worldly pomp exceeding that of kings and emperors, and that cardinals are used to seize wealth from convents, sees, and prelacies, which leads to the destruction of God's service.\n\nSo, overall, Luther is criticizing the concentration of power and wealth in the hands of the Papacy and calling for reforms to address these issues.\n\nNow, I need to look at the options and see who among these reformers had similar views.\n\nOption A is Ulrich Zwingli. He was a Swiss reformer who led the Reformation in Switzerland. Zwingli was known for his emphasis on the authority of Scripture and his rejection of several Catholic doctrines, such as the veneration of saints and the use of images in worship. He also advocated for the separation of church and state, believing that the church should not have temporal power. This seems somewhat aligned with Luther's criticism of the Papacy's grip on temporal affairs.\n\nOption B is Sir Thomas More. He was an English statesman and humanist who initially supported some aspects of reform but later opposed the Protestant Reformation. More remained loyal to the Catholic Church and was executed for refusing to recognize King Henry VIII's divorce and the establishment of the Church of England. His views might not align closely with Luther's, especially since Luther was a key figure in the Protestant Reformation that More opposed.\n\nOption C is Erasmus. He was a Dutch humanist who was critical of the corruption and worldliness within the Church but did not break with the Catholic Church. Erasmus emphasized the importance of education and the study of Scripture in the original languages. He believed in reforming the Church from within and was known for his works like \"In Praise of Folly,\" which satirized the abuses in the Church. His views share some similarities with Luther's in critiquing the Church's practices but differed in that he did not support a schism.\n\nOption D is John Wycliffe. He was an English scholastic philosopher, theologian, Biblical translator, reformer, and seminary professor at Oxford. Wycliffe was an early critic of the Papacy and advocated for translating the Bible into vernacular languages, making it accessible to more people. He also believed in the priesthood of all believers and was critical of the wealth and power of the Church hierarchy.\n\nLooking back at Luther's letter, he criticizes the Pope's wealth and power, the concentration of authority in interpreting Scripture, and the inability to call councils without the Pope's permission. He also mentions the destruction of God's service due to the accumulation of wealth by cardinals.\n\nLet me see which of these reformers had similar criticisms.\n\nUlrich Zwingli did criticize the Church's temporal power and advocated for reforms, but I'm not sure if his views exactly matched Luther's in this letter.\n\nSir Thomas More remained loyal to the Catholic Church and opposed the Reformation, so his views likely differ from Luther's in this context.\n\nErasmus was critical of the Church's corruption but did not support breaking away from the Catholic Church, unlike Luther.\n\nJohn Wycliffe, on the other hand, was an early critic of the Papacy and advocated for reforms similar to those Luther mentions, such as translating the Bible into vernacular languages and critiquing the Church's wealth and power.\n\nWait a minute, the question specifies \"in his letter above.\" So, I need to consider specifically the views expressed in this particular letter by Luther.\n\nIn this letter, Luther is addressing the nobility, calling for reforms, and criticizing the Papacy's power and wealth.\n\nI need to see which reformer expressed similar views in their own work or letters.\n\nLet me think about John Wycliffe first. He was known for his criticisms of the Papacy and the Church's accumulation of wealth. He also advocated for translating the Bible into English, making it more accessible to the laity. This aligns with Luther's emphasis on Scriptural interpretation not being solely the Pope's domain.\n\nUlrich Zwingli, while sharing some similar views on Church reforms, had differences in his theological views compared to Luther, especially regarding the Eucharist.\n\nErasmus was known for his humanist approach and criticism of Church abuses but did not break with the Catholic Church, unlike Luther.\n\nSir Thomas More, as mentioned earlier, opposed the Reformation and remained loyal to the Catholic Church.\n\nGiven this, John Wycliffe seems to have expressed views most similar to Luther's in this letter, particularly in critiquing the Papacy's power and advocating for greater access to Scripture.\n\nBut wait, Wycliffe was active much earlier, in the 14th century, whereas Luther was in the 16th century. However, their criticisms of the Church were similar in nature.\n\nIs there a possibility that another reformer among the options had similar views? Maybe Erasmus?\n\nErasmus was known for his critique of the Church's corruption and worldliness, but he did not support the idea of breaking away from the Catholic Church, which might differ from Luther's eventual actions.\n\nUlrich Zwingli, while sharing some reformist ideas, had a different approach and theological stance from Luther.\n\nSir Thomas More is unlikely, given his opposition to the Reformation.\n\nTherefore, the most similar views to Luther's in this letter would be John Wycliffe's, despite the temporal difference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Erasmus had some similar views, but not to the same extent as Wycliffe.\n\nWait, but the question is about who expressed similar views, not necessarily who agreed with Luther's actions.\n\nSo, based on the views expressed in this letter, which primarily criticize the Papacy's power and the Church's accumulation of wealth, John Wycliffe seems to be the closest match among the options provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. John Wycliffe.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
