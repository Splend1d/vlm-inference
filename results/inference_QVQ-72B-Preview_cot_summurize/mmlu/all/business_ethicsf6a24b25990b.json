                    "text": "I'm trying to fill in the blanks in this sentence about cognitive models explaining consumer behaviour. The options are a bit confusing, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the sentence mentions \"cognitive ________ models.\" I need to choose between \"decision\" and \"attitudinal.\" Hmm, cognitive decision models sound familiar; they probably refer to how people make choices based on their thoughts and information processing. On the other hand, attitudinal models might focus more on people's beliefs and feelings towards certain products or options. So, both could be relevant to consumer behaviour, but which one fits best here?\n\nLooking at the second blank, it says \"the Theory of __________.\" Again, I have two options: \"market equilibrium\" and \"planned behaviour.\" Market equilibrium sounds like it's related to economics, where supply and demand balance out. Planned behaviour seems more psychology-related, focusing on how people plan and intend to act. Given that the first part mentions cognitive models, which are more psychological in nature, \"planned behaviour\" might fit better.\n\nMoving on to the third blank: \"individual ________.\" The options are \"rationality\" and \"social pressures.\" Rationality refers to making logical and reasonable choices, while social pressures are influences from others that affect our decisions. The sentence says that these models \"somewhat oversimplify and overestimate\" this aspect. So, do cognitive models tend to think people are more rational than they actually are, or do they overemphasize the impact of social pressures?\n\nConsidering that many cognitive models assume people are rational decision-makers, but in reality, people are often influenced by emotions, biases, and social factors, it seems like the models might overestimate rationality. Therefore, \"rationality\" makes sense here.\n\nPutting it all together, the correct choice should be C: Decision, Planned behaviour, Rationality.\n\nWait a minute, but option C isn't listed exactly as that. Let me check again. Option C is \"Decision, Planned behaviour, Rationality,\" which matches what I thought.\n\nOption A is \"Decision, Market equilibrium, Rationality\"\n\nOption B is \"Attitudinal, Planned Behaviour, Social pressures\"\n\nOption D is \"Attitudinal, Market equilibrium, Social pressures\"\n\nSo, option C seems to be the best fit.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if \"attitudinal\" could be a possible answer. Attitudinal models do play a role in consumer behaviour, focusing on how people's attitudes shape their purchasing decisions. However, the theory of planned behaviour is more closely associated with decision-making processes, which align better with cognitive decision models.\n\nMoreover, the criticism that these models oversimplify and overestimate rationality aligns with the idea that they assume consumers make logical choices based on available information, ignoring other factors like emotions or social influences.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C: Decision, Planned behaviour, Rationality.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
