                    "text": "So I have this multiplication problem: 2,816 multiplied by 7. I need to figure out which of these options is correct. The options are A. 14,572, B. 14,672, C. 19,612, and D. 19,712.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate 2,816 times 7. Let me write that down.\n\n2,816\n\n\u00d7 7\n\n------\n\nNow, I'll multiply 6 by 7, which is 42. I'll write down the 2 and carry over the 4.\n\n2,816\n\n\u00d7 7\n\n------\n\n42\n\nNext, I'll multiply 1 by 7, which is 7, and add the carried over 4, making it 11. I'll write down the 1 and carry over the 1.\n\n2,816\n\n\u00d7 7\n\n------\n\n112\n\nThen, I'll multiply 8 by 7, which is 56, and add the carried over 1, making it 57. I'll write down the 7 and carry over the 5.\n\n2,816\n\n\u00d7 7\n\n------\n\n5712\n\nFinally, I'll multiply 2 by 7, which is 14, and add the carried over 5, making it 19. I'll write down the 19.\n\n2,816\n\n\u00d7 7\n\n------\n\n19,712\n\nSo, according to my calculation, 2,816 multiplied by 7 equals 19,712.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 14,572\n\nB. 14,672\n\nC. 19,612\n\nD. 19,712\n\nMy answer matches option D. 19,712.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I should check my work. Maybe I can use a different method to verify.\n\nAnother way to multiply is to break it down. For example, 2,816 can be thought of as 2,000 + 800 + 10 + 6.\n\nSo, (2,000 \u00d7 7) + (800 \u00d7 7) + (10 \u00d7 7) + (6 \u00d7 7)\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n2,000 \u00d7 7 = 14,000\n\n800 \u00d7 7 = 5,600\n\n10 \u00d7 7 = 70\n\n6 \u00d7 7 = 42\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n14,000 + 5,600 = 19,600\n\n19,600 + 70 = 19,670\n\n19,670 + 42 = 19,712\n\nYes, that matches my initial answer of 19,712.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use estimation to check if the answer makes sense. If I round 2,816 to 2,800, then 2,800 \u00d7 7 is 19,600. My answer is 19,712, which is close to 19,600, so that seems reasonable.\n\nAnother way to estimate: 2,800 \u00d7 7 = 19,600\n\n6 \u00d7 7 = 42\n\nSo, 19,600 + 42 = 19,642, but wait, that's different from my previous calculations. Hmm, maybe this isn't the best way to check, since it's giving me a different number.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my estimation. Actually, 2,816 is 2,800 + 16, so:\n\n2,800 \u00d7 7 = 19,600\n\n16 \u00d7 7 = 112\n\n19,600 + 112 = 19,712\n\nPerfect, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, through two different methods, I've confirmed that 2,816 \u00d7 7 equals 19,712.\n\nLooking back at the options again:\n\nA. 14,572\n\nB. 14,672\n\nC. 19,612\n\nD. 19,712\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 19,712.\n\nI think that's solid. No need for further checks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 19,712} \\]"
