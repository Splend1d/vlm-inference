                    "text": " So I'm trying to understand this argument by Ashford about backup duties and donating to aid agencies. It seems a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, Ashford is talking about \"backup duties.\" From what I can gather, these are like secondary obligations that kick in when primary duties aren't being fulfilled or are insufficient in some way. So, if there are duties to help the global poor, maybe there are primary ways we should be helping, and then backup ways if those aren't enough or if there are failures in the primary systems.\n\nNow, the context here is effective altruism, which is about using evidence and reason to do the most good possible with our charitable actions. So, effective altruists might focus on donating to charities that are highly efficient and effective in addressing global poverty or other issues.\n\nAshford seems to be saying that by recognizing we have backup duties to donate to aid agencies, we can acknowledge a criticism of effective altruism\u2014that it's just a band-aid approach\u2014but also diffuse that criticism. So, option A says: \"acknowledge the force of the criticism that effective altruism is at best a band-aid approach while diffusing this same criticism.\"\n\nLet me see what that means. The criticism is that effective altruism is only a temporary fix and doesn't address the root causes of problems like global poverty. By admitting that this criticism has some force, Ashford is being honest about the limitations of effective altruism. But then, by also diffusing this criticism, Ashford is probably suggesting ways in which this isn't entirely true or proposing additional steps that can be taken beyond just donating to charities.\n\nMaybe Ashford is arguing that while donating to aid agencies is important, it's not the only thing we should be doing. There might be other actions, like advocating for policy changes or supporting long-term solutions, that can address the underlying causes of poverty. By recognizing that donating is a backup duty, perhaps Ashford is saying that it's okay to use it as a short-term measure while working towards more sustainable and comprehensive solutions.\n\nOption B says: \"acknowledge that effective altruism fails to be the right response to global poverty.\" But that seems too strong. If Ashford is trying to defend effective altruism, acknowledging that it fails entirely wouldn't make sense. Maybe Ashford is saying that it's not perfect, but it's still a valuable approach.\n\nOption C says: \"feel relieved about our duties to the global poor, since backup duties are not morally urgent.\" Hmm, that doesn't seem right. If backup duties are still duties, they should carry some moral weight. Just because they're backup doesn't mean they're not important or urgent. So, feeling relieved might not be the appropriate response.\n\nOption D is \"none of the above,\" but I think A is the closest to what Ashford is arguing. By recognizing backup duties, Ashford is likely trying to position effective altruism as part of a larger strategy to combat global poverty, acknowledging its limitations while also emphasizing its importance in the broader picture.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Maybe Ashford is saying that our primary duties are to address the root causes of poverty, like inequality or lack of education, and backup duties are to provide immediate relief through aid agencies when those primary efforts aren't sufficient or are taking time to bear fruit.\n\nIn that case, by recognizing backup duties, we accept that there are times when quick interventions are necessary, even if they don't solve the underlying problems right away. But at the same time, by diffusing the criticism that effective altruism is just a band-aid, Ashford might be suggesting that these donations are not just temporary fixes but are part of a longer-term plan to build capacity and create sustainable change.\n\nSo, in summary, I think Ashford is arguing for option A: acknowledging the force of the criticism that effective altruism is at best a band-aid approach while also diffusing this criticism by explaining how it fits into a larger strategy for addressing global poverty.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
