The Dutch pay\n\nD. Each pays their own way\n\nHmm, let's see. First off, I know that in some cultures, it's traditional for the man to pay on a date, especially if he invited the woman out. But times are changing, and now it's more common for people to split the bill or take turns paying.\n\nThe term \"dutch treat\" sounds familiar, but I'm not entirely sure what it means. Let me think about the word \"dutch.\" It refers to the Netherlands or its people, but I doubt that the Dutch are literally paying for everyone's meals on dates.\n\nMaybe it has something to do with sharing costs. I recall that in some places, going \"Dutch\" means that each person pays for their own expenses, like meals or drinks. So, in that case, it would be option D: each pays their own way.\n\nBut wait, there's also the expression \"Dutch treat\" which might have a different connotation. Maybe it's a specific type of treat or dish from the Netherlands served on a date?\n\nNo, that seems unlikely. I think it's more about the payment arrangement.\n\nLet me consider the history of the term. \"Going Dutch\" is a phrase that has been around for a long time, and it generally means to divide the cost of something equally among the participants. It's often used in social settings like dining out with friends.\n\nSo, applying that to a date, if it's a \"dutch treat,\" it probably means that both the man and the woman are expected to pay for their own meals or expenses.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's a different meaning when it's specifically referred to as a \"dutch treat\" in the context of a man and woman on a date.\n\nI remember that in some contexts, \"dutch treat\" can also mean that the person who invites someone out is expected to pay, but I think that's more related to business dinners or something like that, not necessarily a romantic date.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"dutch treat\" implies that it's a treat provided by the Dutch, but that seems too literal and doesn't really fit the context of a date.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look up the definition to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nOkay, after a quick search, I find that \"dutch treat\" is indeed a term used to describe a situation where each person pays for their own expenses. So, in the context of a date, it would mean that both individuals are responsible for paying for their own meals, drinks, or whatever they consume.\n\nThis aligns with option D: each pays their own way.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any other common understanding or cultural nuance to \"dutch treat\" that might suggest otherwise. But from what I can gather, it's pretty straightforward\u2014it means everyone pays for themselves.\n\nSo, in summary, for a man and woman on a date, \"dutch treat\" means that each pays their own way.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
