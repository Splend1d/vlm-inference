                    "text": "Let's tackle this logic problem. So, the statement is \"Some blue herons migrate,\" and I need to translate it into predicate logic from the given options. The options are:\n\nA. (\u2200x)[(Hx \u2022 Bx) \u2022 Mx]\n\nB. (\u2203x)[(Hx \u2022 Bx) \u2283 Mx]\n\nC. (\u2200x)[(Hx \u2022 Bx) \u2283 Mx]\n\nD. (\u2203x)[(Hx \u2022 Bx) \u2022 Mx]\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each symbol means:\n\n- Hx: x is a heron\n\n- Bx: x is blue\n\n- Mx: x migrates\n\n- \u2200: for all\n\n- \u2203: there exists\n\n- \u2022: and (conjunction)\n\n- \u2283: implies (conditional)\n\nThe statement \"Some blue herons migrate\" means that there are at least some herons that are blue and migrate. So, it's not about all herons, but some of them.\n\nOption A: (\u2200x)[(Hx \u2022 Bx) \u2022 Mx]\n\nThis says that for all x, if x is a heron and x is blue, then x migrates. But the original statement is about some herons, not all. So, this doesn't seem to match.\n\nOption B: (\u2203x)[(Hx \u2022 Bx) \u2283 Mx]\n\nThis says that there exists an x such that if x is a heron and blue, then it migrates. This seems a bit tricky. The left side of the implication is \"(Hx \u2022 Bx)\", which means x is a heron and blue, and the right side is \"Mx\", meaning it migrates. So, this is saying that there is at least one x where being a heron and blue implies it migrates. But in logic, \"if P then Q\" can be true even if P is false. So, this could be true even if there are no blue herons at all, which doesn't match the original statement that some blue herons migrate.\n\nOption C: (\u2200x)[(Hx \u2022 Bx) \u2283 Mx]\n\nThis says that for all x, if x is a heron and blue, then it migrates. Again, this is a universal statement, saying that every blue heron migrates. But the original statement is only about some blue herons migrating, not all. So, this is too strong.\n\nOption D: (\u2203x)[(Hx \u2022 Bx) \u2022 Mx]\n\nThis says that there exists an x such that x is a heron, x is blue, and x migrates. This seems to match the original statement perfectly. It's saying that there is at least one x that is both a heron and blue, and it migrates.\n\nLet me double-check. The original statement is \"some blue herons migrate.\" This means that there is at least one entity that is a heron, is blue, and migrates. So, in predicate logic, that translates to there exists an x where x is a heron, and x is blue, and x migrates. That's exactly what option D says: (\u2203x)[(Hx \u2022 Bx) \u2022 Mx].\n\nOption B, (\u2203x)[(Hx \u2022 Bx) \u2283 Mx], might be tempting, but as I thought earlier, the implication can be true even if there are no blue herons, which doesn't capture the meaning of the original statement accurately.\n\nSo, the best translation into predicate logic is option D: (\u2203x)[(Hx \u2022 Bx) \u2022 Mx].\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
