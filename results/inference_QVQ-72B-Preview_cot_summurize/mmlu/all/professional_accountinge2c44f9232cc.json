                    "text": "Let's tackle this accounting problem. So, we have a shoe retailer that allows customers to return shoes within 90 days of purchase, and they estimate that 5% of their sales will be returned within that period. During the month in question, the company had sales of $200,000 and also had returns from sales made in prior months amounting to $5,000. The question is asking for the net sales revenue for new sales made during the month, and there are four options: A. $185,000, B. $190,000, C. $195,000, or D. $200,000.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what net sales revenue means. Net sales revenue is typically calculated by subtracting the estimated sales returns and allowances from the total sales revenue. So, if the company estimates that 5% of its sales will be returned, I need to calculate 5% of the $200,000 in sales and subtract that from the total sales to find the net sales revenue.\n\nLet me calculate 5% of $200,000:\n\n5% of $200,000 = (5/100) * $200,000 = $10,000.\n\nSo, the estimated returns are $10,000.\n\nNow, subtracting that from the total sales:\n\n$200,000 - $10,000 = $190,000.\n\nThat seems straightforward, but let's think about whether the returns from prior months affect this calculation.\n\nThe problem mentions that there were returns of sales made in prior months amounting to $5,000. Since these returns are from previous months' sales, they shouldn't directly affect the net sales revenue for the current month's sales. The estimation of returns is based on the current month's sales, which is already accounted for with the 5% allowance.\n\nTherefore, the $5,000 returns from prior months shouldn't be subtracted again for the current month's sales. So, the net sales revenue should still be $190,000.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check that. In accounting, when you have sales returns from prior periods, those would typically affect the revenue recognition for those prior periods, not the current one. So, yes, it makes sense that they don't impact the current month's net sales calculation directly.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes companies adjust their estimates based on actual returns, but in this case, the problem seems to suggest that the 5% estimate is a standard practice, and the actual returns are separate.\n\nSo, my initial calculation seems correct: $200,000 minus 5% estimated returns ($10,000) equals $190,000 net sales revenue.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. $190,000 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this.\n\nPerhaps someone might think that the returns from prior months indicate that the actual return rate is different from the estimated 5%, and adjust accordingly. However, based on the information given, the company still estimates that 5% of current sales will be returned, regardless of the actual returns from prior months.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's confusion about whether to net off the returns against sales or to treat them separately.\n\nIn standard accounting practice, sales revenue is recognized at the point of sale, and an allowance for estimated returns is created based on historical data or expectations. So, the sales revenue is reduced by the estimated returns to arrive at net sales revenue.\n\nTherefore, the calculation remains $200,000 minus $10,000, equaling $190,000.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ \\$190,000} \\]"
