                    "text": "Let's see what these statements are about. I'm not super confident with field theory yet, so I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\n**Statement 1:** \"R is a splitting field of some polynomial over Q.\"\n\nOkay, so R is the field of real numbers, and Q is the field of rational numbers. A splitting field of a polynomial over a field like Q is the smallest field extension of Q that contains all the roots of that polynomial.\n\nSo, I need to figure out if there's a polynomial with rational coefficients such that its splitting field is exactly the field of real numbers, R.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a splitting field is. If I have a polynomial over Q, say p(x), its splitting field is the field you get by starting with Q and then adding in all the roots of p(x). So, if p(x) factors completely over this bigger field, and no smaller field extension of Q contains all the roots.\n\nNow, R is a big field\u2014it contains all real algebraic numbers and all real transcendental numbers. But the key here is that R contains all real roots of any polynomial with rational coefficients, but it doesn't contain any imaginary numbers.\n\nWait a minute, the complex numbers, C, are the algebraic closure of R, meaning every non-constant polynomial with coefficients in R factors completely over C. But R doesn't contain the imaginary unit i, which is a root of x^2 + 1 = 0.\n\nSo, if I take a polynomial like x^2 + 1 over Q, its splitting field is Q(i), which is larger than Q but still a subfield of C.\n\nBut R is the real numbers, which don't include i. So, R is not the splitting field of x^2 + 1 over Q.\n\nMaybe I need to think of a polynomial whose roots are all real numbers. If I can find such a polynomial, then its splitting field would be contained in R.\n\nFor example, take p(x) = x^2 - 2. Its roots are \u00b1\u221a2, which are both real. So, its splitting field is Q(\u221a2), which is a subfield of R.\n\nBut is R the smallest field extension of Q containing all roots of some polynomial?\n\nWait, R is uncountable, while Q is countable. Any algebraic extension of Q is also countable because the algebraic numbers are countable.\n\nHmm, R contains uncountably many transcendental numbers, which are not algebraic over Q.\n\nBut the splitting field of a polynomial over Q is an algebraic extension, since it's generated by the roots of that polynomial, which are algebraic over Q.\n\nTherefore, the splitting field of any polynomial over Q is an algebraic extension, hence countable.\n\nBut R is uncountable, so R cannot be the splitting field of any polynomial over Q.\n\nMaybe another way to look at it: the algebraic closure of Q is the field of algebraic numbers, which is still countable.\n\nR contains not only the algebraic numbers but also the transcendental numbers, like \u03c0 and e, which are not algebraic over Q.\n\nSo, R is strictly larger than the algebraic closure of Q.\n\nTherefore, R cannot be the splitting field of any polynomial over Q, because splitting fields are algebraic extensions, and R is a transcendental extension.\n\nI think Statement 1 is false.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"There is a field with 60 elements.\"\n\nAlright, so I need to determine if there exists a field with exactly 60 elements.\n\nI recall that finite fields, also known as Galois fields, have orders that are powers of prime numbers.\n\nIn other words, for any prime p and positive integer n, there exists (up to isomorphism) exactly one finite field of order p^n, denoted by GF(p^n).\n\nSo, the number of elements in any finite field must be a power of some prime.\n\nNow, 60 is not a prime power. Let's factorize 60 to see its prime factors.\n\n60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5.\n\nSo, 60 is not a prime power. Therefore, there cannot be a finite field with 60 elements.\n\nTo confirm, finite fields only exist for orders that are prime powers, like 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, and so on.\n\nSince 60 is not a prime power, there is no finite field with 60 elements.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, both statements are false.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct answer should be B. False, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
