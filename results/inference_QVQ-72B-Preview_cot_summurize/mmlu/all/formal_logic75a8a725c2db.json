                    "text": "Let's tackle this logic problem. So, the sentence is: \"Pablo will go to the store if, and only if, his brother drives him and pays for gas.\" I need to find which of the given formulas best symbolizes this statement.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"if, and only if\" means in logical terms. \"If, and only if\" is a way of saying that two statements are logically equivalent\u2014that is, they are both true or both false. In logic, this is represented by the biconditional operator, which is usually denoted by \"\u2261\" or \"\u2194\".\n\nSo, the sentence can be broken down like this:\n\n- Pablo will go to the store (P)\n\n- His brother drives him and pays for gas (D \u2022 G)\n\nAnd the relationship between them is \"if, and only if\", which means:\n\nP \u2261 (D \u2022 G)\n\nWait, but looking at the options, there's a difference in how they're presented. Let's assign symbols to each part:\n\n- P: Pablo will go to the store\n\n- D: his brother drives him\n\n- G: his brother pays for gas\n\nNow, the statement is: P \u2261 (D \u2022 G)\n\nBut let's double-check because \"if, and only if\" can sometimes be tricky.\n\n\"If, and only if\" means that P is true if and only if (D \u2022 G) is true. So, yes, that's P \u2261 (D \u2022 G).\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. (P \u2261 D) \u2261 G\n\nThis seems to suggest that the equivalence between P and D is equivalent to G. That doesn't seem to match our statement.\n\nB. (D \u2022 G) \u2283 P\n\nThis is a conditional statement: if D and G, then P. But our statement says \"if, and only if\", which is stronger than just \"if\". So, this doesn't capture the full meaning.\n\nC. P \u2283 (D \u2022 G)\n\nThis is another conditional: if P, then D and G. Again, this only goes one way, but the original statement requires both ways.\n\nD. P \u2261 (D \u2022 G)\n\nThis is exactly what we initially thought the statement meant: Pablo goes to the store if and only if his brother drives him and pays for gas.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure that \"if, and only if\" is indeed the biconditional. Maybe I should consider the definition again.\n\n\"In logic, 'if and only if' is a biconditional logical connective between two statements, which means that both statements are either both true or both false. It's equivalent to saying that each statement is necessary and sufficient for the other.\"\n\nSo, in this case, P is necessary and sufficient for (D \u2022 G). That means:\n\n- If P is true, then (D \u2022 G) must be true (sufficiency).\n\n- If (D \u2022 G) is true, then P must be true (necessity).\n\nTherefore, P \u2261 (D \u2022 G) captures both these aspects.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the statement.\n\nMaybe someone could argue that \"if, and only if\" only implies one direction, but that seems unlikely. No, \"if, and only if\" should be the biconditional.\n\nLet me look at the other options to ensure there's no better fit.\n\nOption A: (P \u2261 D) \u2261 G\n\nThis would mean that the equivalence between P and D is equivalent to G. But that doesn't make much sense in the context of the problem. It's not matching our initial interpretation.\n\nOption B: (D \u2022 G) \u2283 P\n\nThis says that if D and G are true, then P is true. But this is only the \"if\" part of \"if and only if\". It doesn't account for the \"only if\" part.\n\nOption C: P \u2283 (D \u2022 G)\n\nThis is the \"only if\" part: if P is true, then D and G must be true. But again, it's only one direction.\n\nTherefore, neither B nor C captures the full meaning of \"if, and only if\".\n\nOption D: P \u2261 (D \u2022 G)\n\nThis is exactly the biconditional relationship we identified earlier.\n\nWait, but I should consider if there's any precedence or if the conjunction should be inside the equivalence. Is there a way this could be misinterpreted?\n\nLet me think about the truth values.\n\nSuppose P is true. According to the original statement, that means D and G must both be true. So, P \u2192 (D \u2022 G).\n\nConversely, if D and G are both true, then P must be true. So, (D \u2022 G) \u2192 P.\n\nTherefore, combining these, we have P \u2261 (D \u2022 G).\n\nI think this is correct.\n\nBut perhaps to be extra sure, I can consider an example.\n\nSuppose D is true (brother drives), G is true (brother pays), and P is true (Pablo goes). This should be a valid scenario.\n\nIf D is true and G is true, and P is true, that matches P \u2261 (D \u2022 G).\n\nIf D is true and G is true, but P is false (Pablo doesn't go), that violates the original statement, which says Pablo goes if and only if his brother drives and pays.\n\nSimilarly, if P is true but either D or G is false, that also violates the original statement.\n\nSo, the biconditional captures the necessary and sufficient conditions as stated.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization is D: P \u2261 (D \u2022 G).\n\nI don't see any other option that fully captures the meaning of the original sentence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
