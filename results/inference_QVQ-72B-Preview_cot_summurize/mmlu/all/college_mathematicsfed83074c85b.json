                    "text": "So I have this problem here: I need to find the volume of the solid formed by rotating the region bounded by the curves y = x and y = x\u00b2 in the first quadrant around the y-axis. The options are \u03c0/12, \u03c0/6, \u03c0/3, and 2\u03c0/3.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the region. I know that y = x is a straight line passing through the origin with a slope of 1, and y = x\u00b2 is a parabola also passing through the origin. In the first quadrant, both curves start at the origin and extend upwards and to the right.\n\nTo find the bounds of integration, I need to find where these two curves intersect. So, set x\u00b2 = x, which implies x\u00b2 - x = 0, thus x(x - 1) = 0. The solutions are x = 0 and x = 1. So, the region is bounded from x = 0 to x = 1.\n\nNow, since we're rotating around the y-axis, I can use either the disk/washer method or the shell method. I think the shell method might be simpler here because the axis of rotation is vertical.\n\nIn the shell method, the volume is given by V = \u222b 2\u03c0 (radius)(height) dx, where the radius is the distance from the x-axis to the y-axis (which is x), and the height is the difference between the two functions y = x and y = x\u00b2.\n\nSo, height h(x) = x - x\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, V = \u222b from 0 to 1 of 2\u03c0 x (x - x\u00b2) dx.\n\nLet's compute this integral:\n\nV = 2\u03c0 \u222b x (x - x\u00b2) dx from 0 to 1\n\n= 2\u03c0 \u222b (x\u00b2 - x\u00b3) dx from 0 to 1\n\nNow, integrate term by term:\n\n= 2\u03c0 [ (1/3)x\u00b3 - (1/4)x\u2074 ] from 0 to 1\n\nNow, plug in the limits:\n\n= 2\u03c0 { [ (1/3)(1)\u00b3 - (1/4)(1)\u2074 ] - [ (1/3)(0)\u00b3 - (1/4)(0)\u2074 ] }\n\n= 2\u03c0 (1/3 - 1/4)\n\n= 2\u03c0 (1/12)\n\n= \u03c0/6\n\nSo, the volume is \u03c0/6, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if I have the correct setup. Maybe I should try using the disk/washer method to confirm.\n\nUsing the disk/washer method, since we're rotating around the y-axis, it might be easier to solve in terms of y.\n\nFirst, express x in terms of y for both functions:\n\nFrom y = x, x = y\n\nFrom y = x\u00b2, x = \u221ay\n\nSo, the region in terms of y goes from y = 0 to y =1, and for each y, the x ranges from \u221ay to y.\n\nWait, actually, no. To use the disk/washer method, we need to consider the outer radius and inner radius in terms of y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to stick with the shell method since that gave me \u03c0/6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the volume of a solid of revolution using integration.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the shell method. Let me think again.\n\nIn the shell method, the volume is V = \u222b 2\u03c0 (radius)(height) dx.\n\nHere, the radius is the distance from the x-axis to the axis of rotation, which is the y-axis, so radius is x.\n\nThe height is the difference between the two functions, which are y = x and y = x\u00b2.\n\nWait, but y = x is higher than y = x\u00b2 in the interval from x = 0 to x =1, since x - x\u00b2 is positive there.\n\nSo, height h(x) = x - x\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, V = \u222b from 0 to 1 of 2\u03c0 x (x - x\u00b2) dx.\n\nWhich is what I calculated earlier, giving \u03c0/6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the region is bounded by both curves, and when rotated, the volume is the volume of the outer solid minus the volume of the inner solid.\n\nBut no, the shell method should account for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the washer method.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nIn the washer method, we integrate along the y-axis since we're rotating around the y-axis.\n\nThe washer method formula is V = \u222b \u03c0 (outer radius)^2 - \u03c0 (inner radius)^2 dy.\n\nHere, for each y, the outer radius is x = y (from y = x), and the inner radius is x = \u221ay (from y = x\u00b2).\n\nWait, actually, in terms of y, when y goes from 0 to 1, x goes from \u221ay to y.\n\nSo, for each y, the outer radius is y, and the inner radius is \u221ay.\n\nWait, no. At y = x, x = y, and at y = x\u00b2, x = \u221ay.\n\nSo, the outer radius is y, and the inner radius is \u221ay.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the outer radius is the larger x-value, which is y, and the inner radius is \u221ay.\n\nWait, no. Let's think carefully.\n\nAt y = x, x = y\n\nAt y = x\u00b2, x = \u221ay\n\nSo, for a given y, the left boundary is x = \u221ay and the right boundary is x = y.\n\nBut in terms of radii for the washer method, the outer radius is the distance from the axis of rotation to the outer boundary, and the inner radius is to the inner boundary.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing myself.\n\nLet me look up the washer method formula.\n\nThe washer method is V = \u222b \u03c0 (R(y))^2 - \u03c0 (r(y))^2 dy, where R(y) is the outer radius and r(y) is the inner radius.\n\nIn this case, since we're rotating around the y-axis, the outer radius is the x-value of the curve that is farther from the y-axis, and the inner radius is the x-value of the curve that is closer to the y-axis.\n\nSo, for each y, from y = 0 to y =1, x ranges from \u221ay to y.\n\nTherefore, the outer radius R(y) = y, and the inner radius r(y) = \u221ay.\n\nTherefore, V = \u222b from y=0 to y=1 of \u03c0 y\u00b2 - \u03c0 (\u221ay)\u00b2 dy\n\n= \u03c0 \u222b (y\u00b2 - y) dy from 0 to 1\n\nNow, integrate term by term:\n\n= \u03c0 [ (1/3)y\u00b3 - (1/2)y\u00b2 ] from 0 to 1\n\n= \u03c0 { [ (1/3)(1)^3 - (1/2)(1)^2 ] - [ (1/3)(0)^3 - (1/2)(0)^2 ] }\n\n= \u03c0 (1/3 - 1/2)\n\n= \u03c0 (-1/6)\n\nBut volume can't be negative. Hmm, I must have set it up wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the inner and outer radii swapped.\n\nLet me check the x-values again.\n\nAt y = x, x = y\n\nAt y = x\u00b2, x = \u221ay\n\nFrom y =0 to y=1, x increases from \u221ay to y.\n\nWait, at y=0, both x=0.\n\nAt y=1, x=1 for both.\n\nBut between y=0 and y=1, x = y is greater than x = \u221ay.\n\nWait, no. At y=0.25, x = \u221a0.25 = 0.5, and y=0.25. So, x=0.5 is greater than y=0.25. Wait, no.\n\nWait, y = x, so at y=0.25, x=0.25\n\nAt y = x\u00b2, x = \u221ay, so at y=0.25, x=0.5\n\nSo, x ranges from \u221ay to y.\n\nWait, no. At y=0.25, x=\u221a0.25=0.5, and y=0.25.\n\nSo, x goes from 0.5 to 0.25? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to rethink this.\n\nLet me plot y=x and y=x\u00b2.\n\nAt y=x, it's a straight line at 45 degrees.\n\nAt y=x\u00b2, it's a parabola opening upwards.\n\nIn the first quadrant, from x=0 to x=1, y=x is above y=x\u00b2.\n\nWait, no. At x=0, both are 0.\n\nAt x=0.5, y=0.5 and y=0.25.\n\nWait, y=x is higher than y=x\u00b2 from x=0 to x=1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, at x=0, y=0 for both.\n\nAt x=0.5, y=0.5 (y=x) and y=0.25 (y=x\u00b2). So y=x is higher.\n\nAt x=1, y=1 for both.\n\nSo, for x from 0 to 1, y=x is above y=x\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, in terms of x, the height is y=x - y=x\u00b2 = x - x\u00b2.\n\nSo, going back to the shell method, which I initially used, V = \u222b 2\u03c0 x (x - x\u00b2) dx from 0 to 1.\n\nWhich gave me \u03c0/6.\n\nBut now, using the washer method, I seem to be getting a different result, but I think I set it up incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to set up the washer method differently.\n\nIn the washer method, integrating with respect to y, the outer radius is x = y (from y = x), and the inner radius is x = \u221ay (from y = x\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, V = \u222b from y=0 to y=1 of \u03c0 (y)^2 - \u03c0 (\u221ay)^2 dy\n\n= \u03c0 \u222b (y\u00b2 - y) dy from 0 to 1\n\n= \u03c0 [ (1/3)y\u00b3 - (1/2)y\u00b2 ] from 0 to 1\n\n= \u03c0 (1/3 - 1/2)\n\n= \u03c0 (-1/6)\n\nBut volume can't be negative, so I must have the inner and outer radii swapped.\n\nActually, at y=0, both x=0.\n\nAt y=1, x=1 for both.\n\nBetween y=0 and y=1, x = y is greater than x = \u221ay.\n\nWait, at y=0.25, x=0.5 (from y = x\u00b2), and x=0.25 (from y = x). Wait, no.\n\nWait, y = x, so x = y.\n\ny = x\u00b2, so x = \u221ay.\n\nSo, for y from 0 to 1, x goes from \u221ay to y.\n\nTherefore, the outer radius is y, and the inner radius is \u221ay.\n\nTherefore, V = \u222b from y=0 to y=1 of \u03c0 (y)^2 - \u03c0 (\u221ay)^2 dy\n\n= \u03c0 \u222b (y\u00b2 - y) dy from 0 to 1\n\n= \u03c0 [ (1/3)y\u00b3 - (1/2)y\u00b2 ] from 0 to 1\n\n= \u03c0 (1/3 - 1/2)\n\n= \u03c0 (-1/6)\n\nWait, that's still negative, which doesn't make sense.\n\nI must have the radii swapped.\n\nActually, the outer radius should be the larger x-value, which is y, and the inner radius is \u221ay.\n\nBut in this case, at y=0.25, x=0.5 (from y = x\u00b2) and x=0.25 (from y = x). So x=0.5 is larger than x=0.25.\n\nWait, no. Wait, y = x, so x = y =0.25, and y = x\u00b2, so x = \u221ay =0.5.\n\nSo, x ranges from y to \u221ay? Wait, no.\n\nWait, x from y = x\u00b2 is x = \u221ay, and from y = x is x = y.\n\nSo, for y from 0 to 1, x goes from \u221ay to y.\n\nTherefore, the outer radius is y, and the inner radius is \u221ay.\n\nTherefore, V = \u222b from y=0 to y=1 of \u03c0 (y)^2 - \u03c0 (\u221ay)^2 dy\n\n= \u03c0 \u222b (y\u00b2 - y) dy from 0 to 1\n\n= \u03c0 [ (1/3)y\u00b3 - (1/2)y\u00b2 ] from 0 to 1\n\n= \u03c0 (1/3 - 1/2)\n\n= \u03c0 (-1/6)\n\nBut volume can't be negative, so I must have the radii swapped.\n\nActually, since x = y is less than x = \u221ay for y from 0 to 1, the outer radius should be \u221ay and the inner radius y.\n\nTherefore, V = \u222b from y=0 to y=1 of \u03c0 (\u221ay)^2 - \u03c0 (y)^2 dy\n\n= \u03c0 \u222b (y - y\u00b2) dy from 0 to 1\n\n= \u03c0 [ (1/2)y\u00b2 - (1/3)y\u00b3 ] from 0 to 1\n\n= \u03c0 (1/2 - 1/3)\n\n= \u03c0 (1/6)\n\nSo, using the washer method, I also get \u03c0/6.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \u03c0/6, which is option B.\n\nI think the initial confusion was due to setting up the radii incorrectly in the washer method, but now it makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\pi}{6}} \\]"
