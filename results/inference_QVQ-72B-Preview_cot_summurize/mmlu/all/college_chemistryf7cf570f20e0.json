                    "text": "So I have this question about spontaneous processes, and I need to figure out which statement is always true for such processes. The options are:\n\nA. The process is exothermic.\n\nB. The process does not involve any work.\n\nC. The entropy of the system increases.\n\nD. The total entropy of the system plus surroundings increases.\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a spontaneous process is. In thermodynamics, a spontaneous process is one that occurs naturally without any external intervention. It's like water flowing downhill; it just happens on its own.\n\nNow, I need to see which of these options is always true for such processes.\n\nOption A says the process is exothermic. Exothermic means that heat is released during the process. But is this always the case for spontaneous processes? I don't think so. There are endothermic reactions that can be spontaneous under certain conditions. For example, melting ice at temperatures above 0 degrees Celsius is endothermic but still spontaneous. So, this can't be always true.\n\nOption B says the process does not involve any work. Work can be involved in spontaneous processes. For instance, when a gas expands against pressure, it's doing work, and this is a spontaneous process. So, this can't be always true either.\n\nOption C says the entropy of the system increases. Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. While it's common to think that spontaneous processes lead to increased entropy in the system, this isn't always the case. There are spontaneous processes where the entropy of the system decreases. For example, when gas dissolves in a liquid, the entropy of the gas decreases because the molecules are more confined in the liquid state. But the process is still spontaneous under certain conditions. So, this can't be always true.\n\nOption D says the total entropy of the system plus surroundings increases. This seems promising. The second law of thermodynamics states that in an isolated system, the total entropy never decreases over time; it either increases or remains constant. But for spontaneous processes, the entropy should increase.\n\nWait, but in real-world scenarios, systems are rarely completely isolated. So, perhaps I need to think in terms of the universe, where the total entropy always increases for spontaneous processes.\n\nLet me double-check this. If a process is spontaneous, it means it's happening naturally, and according to the second law, such processes must lead to an increase in the total entropy of the universe, which includes both the system and its surroundings.\n\nSo, even if the entropy of the system decreases, as long as the entropy of the surroundings increases by a larger amount, the total entropy still increases, and the process can be spontaneous.\n\nFor example, in the dissolution of gas in liquid where the system's entropy decreases, the entropy of the surroundings might increase due to heat absorption or other effects, leading to an overall increase in total entropy.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the correct choice because it's the only one that holds true for all spontaneous processes, regardless of whether the system's entropy increases or decreases.\n\nTo make sure, let's consider another example. Take the combustion of wood. This is a spontaneous process: wood burns in air to produce heat and light. This process is exothermic (releases heat), involves work (like expanding gases), and likely increases the entropy of the system (from ordered chemical bonds to more dispersed energy forms). But more importantly, the total entropy of the system plus surroundings increases, which aligns with option D.\n\nAnother example: the freezing of water. When water freezes into ice at a temperature below 0 degrees Celsius, it's a spontaneous process. The system's entropy decreases because the liquid water becomes more ordered as ice. However, the surroundings absorb heat (since freezing is exothermic), leading to an increase in the entropy of the surroundings. Overall, the total entropy increases, which again supports option D.\n\nSo, based on these examples and the general principle of the second law of thermodynamics, it seems that option D is indeed always true for spontaneous processes.\n\nWait a minute, is there any spontaneous process where the total entropy doesn't increase? I can't think of one. The second law is pretty absolute in stating that for isolated systems, entropy always increases or remains constant, but spontaneous processes specifically involve increases in entropy.\n\nMoreover, in non-isolated systems, the change in total entropy is the sum of the entropy change of the system and the entropy change of the surroundings. For spontaneous processes, this total change must be positive.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct answer: the total entropy of the system plus surroundings increases in spontaneous processes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
