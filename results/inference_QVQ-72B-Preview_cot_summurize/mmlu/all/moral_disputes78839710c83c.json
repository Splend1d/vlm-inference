                    "text": " So I'm reading this article by William Marquis about abortion, and he has some pretty strong views on why it's wrong to kill a fetus. Let me try to wrap my head around his main argument here.\n\nFirst off, Marquis seems to be focusing on the morality of abortion, specifically looking at why terminating a pregnancy might be considered ethically wrong. He mentions several points, but one that stands out is the idea that killing a fetus deprives it of a valuable future. That sounds significant.\n\nLet me see: he argues that when you abort a fetus, you're essentially ending its potential life, which could have been filled with all sorts of good things\u2014happiness, experiences, relationships, and so on. So, by terminating the pregnancy, you're robbing the fetus of those future possibilities. That seems like a substantial moral consideration.\n\nHe also touches on the fetus's ability to feel pain, which is another angle. I know that there's a debate about when exactly a fetus can feel pain during pregnancy. Some people argue that it's only towards the later stages, while others think it happens earlier. Marquis seems to suggest that the fetus can feel pain, which would make aborting it morally problematic because you're causing suffering.\n\nAdditionally, he mentions that abortion can harm the woman. That's an interesting point. I've heard that abortions can have both physical and psychological effects on women. Physically, there might be risks like infection, bleeding, or damage to reproductive organs. Psychologically, some women might experience guilt, regret, or other emotional distress after an abortion. So, if that's the case, then promoting abortion could be seen as harmful to women's well-being.\n\nPutting it all together, Marquis seems to be saying that aborting a fetus is wrong for multiple reasons: it causes pain to the fetus, it harms the mother, and it deprives the fetus of a valuable future. But the question is, which of these does he consider the main reason?\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. The fetus can feel pain.\n\nB. Abortion will harm the woman.\n\nC. Killing the fetus would deprive it of a valuable future.\n\nD. all of the above.\n\nIt seems like Marquis considers all three points to be relevant moral considerations against abortion. However, I think he places particular emphasis on the idea that killing the fetus deprives it of a valuable future. That seems to be a central part of his argument.\n\nHe might be drawing from the concept of future-oriented harm, where actions are wrong because they prevent someone from experiencing a good life that they otherwise would have had. In this case, the fetus is being prevented from having that life.\n\nAt the same time, he acknowledges that the fetus can feel pain, which introduces the issue of causing immediate suffering. And the potential harm to the woman is also a significant factor.\n\nBut if I had to choose the main reason, I'd probably go with option C: killing the fetus would deprive it of a valuable future. That seems to be the core of his argument, although the other points are also important in his overall stance.\n\nWait a minute, maybe it's not that straightforward. Maybe he considers all three reasons to be equally important. But since I have to pick one as the main reason, I'll stick with C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he views the deprivation of the future as the most fundamental wrong, and the pain and harm to the fetus and mother are additional considerations that reinforce his position.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose I were to prioritize these reasons:\n\n1. Depriving the fetus of a valuable future.\n\n2. Causing pain to the fetus.\n\n3. Causing harm to the mother.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, preventing someone from experiencing a valuable life seems like a profound wrong, because it's about the loss of all the good things that person could have experienced. Causing pain is also wrong, but it's more immediate and limited in scope. Harm to the mother adds another layer of ethical concern, as we don't want to cause harm to parents either.\n\nSo, in that hierarchy, the deprivation of the fetus's future seems to carry the most weight.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Perhaps Marquis believes that the potential future of the fetus is what gives it moral status in the first place. If that's the case, then yes, depriving it of that future would be the primary moral issue.\n\nOn the other hand, if he thinks that the fetus's ability to feel pain is what grants it moral consideration, then that would be another story. But from what I've read, it seems like he emphasizes the future-oriented harm.\n\nI should also consider the timing of these considerations. The fetus's ability to feel pain might depend on its developmental stage, whereas the deprivation of its future is a constant, regardless of its current capabilities.\n\nMoreover, the harm to the mother is a separate issue that might influence the decision but isn't directly about the morality of killing the fetus itself. It's more about the consequences for the mother.\n\nSo, perhaps the main reason is indeed the deprivation of the fetus's valuable future, with the other points serving as supplementary reasons.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the main reason Marquis thinks it's wrong to kill a fetus is that it deprives the fetus of a valuable future. So, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
