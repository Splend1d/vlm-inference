The options are 62%, 72%, 82%, and 92%. I'm not entirely sure about the exact percentage, but I think I have some general knowledge that can help me make an educated guess.\n\nFirst off, I know that the United States is a highly urbanized country. Most people live in cities or metropolitan areas. I recall that around the turn of the 21st century, the majority of the population was already living in urban settings. So, it's safe to say that the percentage is quite high.\n\nLooking back at the options, 62% seems a bit low for such a developed country. I mean, even in less developed countries, urbanization rates are often above 50% these days. So, 62% might not be impossible, but it seems somewhat low for the U.S.\n\nNext, 72% also seems plausible, but I have a feeling that the urbanization rate in the U.S. is higher than that. Maybe I'm misremembering, but I think I've seen statistics that put it in the 80s.\n\n82% looks attractive. I know that cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and so on have massive populations, and a lot of people are concentrated in these areas. Additionally, smaller cities and suburbs are also considered urban areas, which would further increase the percentage.\n\nThen there's 92%. That seems really high. I wonder if that's accurate. While the U.S. is highly urbanized, I doubt that 92% of the population lives in urban areas. There are still quite a few rural areas and small towns that are home to significant numbers of people.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Maybe I can look up some recent data on U.S. urbanization rates. I recall that the Census Bureau provides information on population distribution, including urban and rural areas.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the definition of \"urban areas.\" According to the U.S. Census Bureau, an urban area is defined as \"places with concentrations of at least 2,500 people per square mile.\" That includes both cities and densely populated suburbs.\n\nWait, actually, I think the definition is a bit more specific. I believe an urban area is defined as having 50,000 or more people, and an urban cluster is smaller, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should stick to the options provided.\n\nAnother angle: I know that global urbanization rates vary widely. For example, countries like Monaco or Vatican City are entirely urban, while others like Mongolia have much lower urbanization rates. The U.S., being a developed country, is expected to have a higher urbanization rate, but not necessarily the highest in the world.\n\nI also recall that in 2010, the U.S. urbanization rate was around 80%, but I'm not sure if that's exact. Maybe it has changed since then.\n\nWait, the question specifies 2017. So, I need data from that year. Typically, urbanization increases over time, so if it was around 80% in 2010, it might be slightly higher by 2017.\n\nBut, I don't want to make assumptions based on trends without any solid data.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Maybe I can think about the population distribution within the U.S. The majority lives in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), which are essentially urban areas and their surrounding suburbs.\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau, there are hundreds of MSAs in the U.S., covering most of the population. So, if most people live in these areas, that would suggest a high urbanization rate.\n\nBut again, that doesn't give me the exact percentage.\n\nPerhaps I can look for some estimates online. There are various reliable sources that provide demographic data, such as the World Bank, the United Nations, or the Census Bureau itself.\n\nIf I were to guess based on the options given, I'd lean towards 82%. It seems like a reasonable figure for the U.S. urban population in 2017.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider some comparable countries. For example, Canada has a similar level of development and also has a high urbanization rate, around 80%. Similarly, European countries often have urbanization rates in the 70-80% range.\n\nGiven that, 82% seems consistent with these comparisons.\n\nI should also consider the total population of the U.S. As of 2017, the U.S. population was approximately 326 million people. If 82% lived in urban areas, that would be roughly 267 million people. That sounds feasible, considering the population densities in major urban centers.\n\nOn the other hand, if it were 92%, that would be about 299 million people, which seems too high, as I know there are significant rural populations in states like Wyoming, Vermont, and so on.\n\nSimilarly, 72% would be about 235 million, which might be too low, given the prominence of urban areas.\n\n62% would be only about 201 million, which definitely seems too low for a country where cities dominate the economic and cultural landscape.\n\nTherefore, based on my reasoning, I'm going to go with option C, 82%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
