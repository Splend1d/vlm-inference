                    "text": "So I've got this equation to solve: 18 + p = 29. I need to find the value of p. Let's see, I think I should isolate p to find its value. To do that, I should probably subtract 18 from both sides of the equation.\n\nSo, if I subtract 18 from both sides, I get:\n\n18 + p - 18 = 29 - 18\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\np = 29 - 18\n\nNow, I need to subtract 18 from 29. Let's calculate that: 29 minus 18 is 11.\n\nSo, p = 11.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe I can check my answer by plugging it back into the original equation. If p = 11, then:\n\n18 + 11 = 29\n\nYes, that's correct because 18 plus 11 does equal 29.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about adding a negative number or something, but that doesn't seem necessary here since the equation is straightforward addition.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other approach. Maybe using algebraic properties or something, but no, this seems pretty simple.\n\nSo, based on my calculation, the correct answer should be C. 11.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider why the other options might be wrong.\n\nOption A is \u221247. That's a negative number, and since I'm dealing with addition and positive numbers in the equation, it doesn't make sense for p to be negative in this context.\n\nOption B is \u221211. Again, that's negative, and there's no reason for p to be negative based on the equation given.\n\nOption D is 47. That's a larger number than what's needed. If p were 47, then 18 + 47 would be 65, which is not equal to 29.\n\nTherefore, the only correct answer is C. 11.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
