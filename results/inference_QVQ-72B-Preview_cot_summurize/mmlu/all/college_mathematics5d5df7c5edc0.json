                    "text": "So I have this problem here. Let's see what it's asking. We have a subset S of R^2, which consists of all points (x, y) in the unit square [0,1] \u00d7 [0,1], where either x or y, or both, are irrational numbers. And I need to figure out, with respect to the standard topology on R^2, what properties S has from the options given: closed, open, connected, or totally disconnected.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand the definition of S. So, S includes all points (x, y) where:\n\n- x is irrational and y is rational,\n\n- x is rational and y is irrational,\n\n- both x and y are irrational.\n\nIt excludes points where both x and y are rational, since in that case, neither x nor y is irrational.\n\nSo, S is the set of all points in the unit square where at least one coordinate is irrational.\n\nNow, I need to think about the standard topology on R^2, which is the topology induced by the Euclidean metric. In this topology, open sets are unions of open disks, and closed sets are the complements of open sets.\n\nLet's consider the complement of S in [0,1]\u00d7[0,1]. The complement consists of all points where both x and y are rational. So, the complement of S is the set of points (x, y) in [0,1]\u00d7[0,1] where both x and y are rational.\n\nI need to think about whether S is open, closed, connected, or totally disconnected.\n\nLet's start with option A: closed.\n\nA set is closed if its complement is open. So, is the complement of S open in the standard topology?\n\nThe complement is the set of points where both coordinates are rational. Is this set open?\n\nWell, the set of rational numbers in R is not open; in fact, it's dense in R, meaning its closure is all of R. Similarly, the set of rational numbers in [0,1] is dense in [0,1].\n\nBut in R^2, the set of points where both coordinates are rational is countable and has no interior points. Does that make it open?\n\nI don't think so. For a set to be open, every point in the set should have a neighborhood contained entirely within the set. But for any point with both coordinates rational, any open disk around that point will contain points with at least one irrational coordinate, since irrational numbers are dense in R.\n\nTherefore, the complement of S has no interior points and is not open. So, S is not closed.\n\nWait, but actually, in a topological space, a set can be neither open nor closed. So, just because the complement isn't open doesn't necessarily mean S isn't closed. But in this case, since the complement isn't open, S can't be open.\n\nWait, no. If the complement isn't open, then S isn't closed. But S could still be open, or neither open nor closed.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nOption A: closed \u2013 seems not, because the complement isn't open.\n\nOption B: open \u2013 is S open?\n\nFor S to be open, every point in S should have a neighborhood contained entirely within S.\n\nConsider a point (x, y) in S where x is irrational and y is rational.\n\nAny open disk around this point will contain points where both x and y are rational, since rational numbers are dense in R.\n\nTherefore, there is no open disk around such a point that lies entirely within S.\n\nSimilarly, if both x and y are irrational, any open disk around this point will contain points with at least one rational coordinate.\n\nSo, S doesn't contain any open disks, meaning it has no interior points. Therefore, S is not open.\n\nSo, options A and B are out.\n\nNow, option C: connected.\n\nA set is connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint nonempty open sets.\n\nAlternatively, if any two points in the set can be joined by a path lying entirely within the set.\n\nOption D: totally disconnected.\n\nA set is totally disconnected if its only connected subsets are single points.\n\nSo, I need to determine whether S is connected or totally disconnected.\n\nFirst, let's think about connectedness.\n\nIs S connected?\n\nWell, the unit square [0,1]\u00d7[0,1] is connected because it's a continuous image of connected sets.\n\nBut S is a subset of the unit square, consisting of points with at least one irrational coordinate.\n\nIs S connected?\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nConsider the boundary of S in [0,1]\u00d7[0,1].\n\nThe boundary would be the complement of S, which is the set of points with both coordinates rational.\n\nBut S is not closed, as we saw earlier, so its boundary includes points not in S.\n\nWait, actually, the boundary of S is the set of points where every neighborhood intersects both S and its complement.\n\nIn this case, since both rationals and irrationals are dense in R, every open set in R^2 contains points with both coordinates rational and points with at least one coordinate irrational.\n\nTherefore, the boundary of S is the entire unit square [0,1]\u00d7[0,1].\n\nSo, S is dense in [0,1]\u00d7[0,1], and its complement is also dense.\n\nThis suggests that S is not connected because it's possible to separate it into two disjoint open sets in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S is totally disconnected.\n\nLet me think about paths in S.\n\nSuppose I take two points in S, say (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), both with at least one irrational coordinate.\n\nCan I find a continuous path in S connecting them?\n\nGiven the density of rationals and irrationals, any continuous path will necessarily pass through points where both coordinates are rational, which are not in S.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to have a path in S connecting two points without passing through points not in S.\n\nThis suggests that S is not path-connected, and hence not connected.\n\nSo, option C is out.\n\nNow, option D: totally disconnected.\n\nIf S is totally disconnected, then the only connected subsets are single points.\n\nIs that the case?\n\nLet me consider a point in S, say (x, y), where x is irrational and y is rational.\n\nIs there any subset containing this point that is connected and contains more than one point?\n\nSuppose I take a small open disk around (x, y). This disk will contain points with both coordinates rational, which are not in S, and points with at least one coordinate irrational.\n\nTherefore, any open set containing (x, y) will not be entirely contained in S, and hence cannot be connected in S.\n\nSimilarly, if I take a point where both x and y are irrational, any open set containing it will contain points with at least one rational coordinate, which are not in S.\n\nTherefore, again, no open set containing the point is entirely within S.\n\nThis suggests that the only connected subsets of S are single points.\n\nTherefore, S is totally disconnected.\n\nSo, the answer should be D: totally disconnected.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nIs there any way that S could have connected subsets with more than one point?\n\nSuppose I take two points in S where both coordinates are irrational.\n\nCould there be a connected subset containing both?\n\nWell, any continuous curve connecting them would have to pass through points with both coordinates rational, which are not in S.\n\nTherefore, such a curve cannot exist entirely within S.\n\nHence, no, there are no connected subsets with more than one point.\n\nTherefore, S is totally disconnected.\n\nSo, the correct choice is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
