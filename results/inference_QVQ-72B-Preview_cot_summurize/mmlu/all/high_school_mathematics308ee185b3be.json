                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: there's this operation defined, a star b equals a to the power of b minus a times b. And I need to find x such that when I plug in 2 for a and x for b, it equals 22. So, 2 star x equals 22.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this star operation does. It's defined as a^b - a*b. So, for 2 star x, it's 2^x - 2*x. And this equals 22.\n\nI need to solve for x in this equation: 2^x - 2*x = 22.\n\nHmm, this looks a bit tricky because x is both in the exponent and as a multiplier. I'm not sure if I can solve this algebraically straight away. Maybe I can try plugging in some values to see if one of them works.\n\nLooking at the multiple-choice options, x could be 5, 22, 11, or 6. Maybe one of these works.\n\nLet's try x = 5 first.\n\nSo, 2^5 - 2*5 = 32 - 10 = 22. Okay, that equals 22. So, x = 5 seems to be a solution.\n\nBut, I should check if there are any other solutions, just to be sure.\n\nLet's try x = 6.\n\n2^6 - 2*6 = 64 - 12 = 52. That's way bigger than 22.\n\nx = 4.\n\n2^4 - 2*4 = 16 - 8 = 8. That's less than 22.\n\nx = 3.\n\n2^3 - 2*3 = 8 - 6 = 2. Still less than 22.\n\nx = 11.\n\n2^11 - 2*11 = 2048 - 22 = 2026. Way bigger than 22.\n\nx = 22.\n\n2^22 - 2*22 = 4194304 - 44 = 4194260. That's even bigger.\n\nSo, among the given options, only x = 5 gives 22.\n\nBut, I should make sure that there aren't any other solutions. Maybe there's a fractional value that works, but since the options are integers, probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can graph the function f(x) = 2^x - 2*x and see where it intersects with y = 22.\n\nFrom the values I tried, at x=5, f(5)=22, and at x=6, f(6)=52, which is above 22. At x=4, f(4)=8, which is below 22.\n\nAt x=3, f(3)=2, still below.\n\nAt x=2, f(2)=4 - 4=0, which is below 22.\n\nAt x=1, f(1)=2 - 2=0.\n\nSo, it seems like the function increases from 0 at x=1 and x=2, up to 22 at x=5, and then keeps increasing.\n\nSo, within the integer values, only x=5 gives exactly 22.\n\nI think the answer is x=5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
