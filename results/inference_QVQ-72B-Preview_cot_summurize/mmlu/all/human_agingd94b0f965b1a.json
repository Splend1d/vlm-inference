                    "text": "So I have this question about locus of control, and I need to figure out which type Gary has based on his statement about winning the lottery. He says he won $1000 because he really knows how to pick those numbers. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what locus of control means. From what I recall, locus of control refers to where a person believes control over their life and events lies. There are generally two types: internal and external locus of control.\n\nInternal locus of control means that a person believes they have control over their own life and the things that happen to them. They think their actions and decisions directly influence the outcomes.\n\nExternal locus of control, on the other hand, means that a person believes external factors, like luck, fate, or other people, have more control over their life and events.\n\nGiven that, Gary says he won the lottery because he really knows how to pick those numbers. That sounds like he's attributing his win to his own ability or skill in picking numbers. So, he's suggesting that because he's good at picking numbers, he won the money. That seems like he's seeing his own actions and abilities as the reason for his success, which points towards an internal locus of control.\n\nBut wait, winning the lottery is often seen as a matter of chance or luck, which would be external factors. So, it's interesting that Gary is attributing it to his own skill rather than luck.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA. External, powerful others\n\nB. Internal\n\nC. External, chance\n\nD. Secondary\n\nHmm, \"secondary\" isn't a term I recall in this context. Maybe it's a typo or something, but I'll ignore that for now.\n\nSo, between A, B, and C, which one fits Gary's statement?\n\nHe's saying he won because he knows how to pick numbers. That sounds like confidence in his own ability, which is internal. If he had said something like \"I won because I was lucky\" or \"the stars were aligned,\" that would be external, perhaps chance.\n\nBut let's think deeper. Is there a possibility that he still believes in external factors? For example, maybe he thinks that his ability to pick numbers is a skill he has, but he also recognizes that luck plays a role in winning the lottery.\n\nHowever, based on the statement provided, he's explicitly saying it's because he knows how to pick numbers, implying that his skill is the primary reason for his win.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate choice seems to be B. Internal.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"Gary would be said to have a strong ____ locus of control.\" It's asking about his general locus of control orientation, not just in this specific situation.\n\nSo, if Gary attributes his lottery win to his ability to pick numbers, it suggests that he tends to attribute outcomes to his own actions or abilities, which would indicate an internal locus of control.\n\nBut, it's possible that someone with an external locus of control might occasionally attribute success to their own actions, even if their general tendency is to see control as external.\n\nHowever, based on this single statement, it seems that Gary is attributing the outcome to his own skill, which points towards an internal locus of control.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a cultural or contextual aspect I'm missing, but based on the information given, B. Internal seems the most fitting answer.\n\nLet me check some resources to confirm this understanding.\n\nI found that locus of control is a personality trait that refers to the degree to which individuals believe they can control the events that affect their lives. Those with an internal locus of control believe that their actions and choices shape their destinies, while those with an external locus of control believe that external forces, such as luck or fate, determine what happens to them.\n\nIn this scenario, Gary attributes his lottery win to his ability to pick numbers, which is an internal factor, suggesting that he has an internal locus of control.\n\nAnother source mentions that people with an internal locus of control are more likely to take responsibility for their actions and see themselves as agents of change, whereas those with an external locus of control might attribute outcomes to factors beyond their control, such as luck or the influence of powerful others.\n\nGiven that, Gary's attribution to his own ability aligns more with an internal locus of control.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider if there's any indication that he might be attributing his win to external factors.\n\nFor example, if he had said something like \"I won because I'm lucky,\" that would point to an external locus of control, specifically to chance.\n\nBut in this case, he's attributing it to his own skill, so internal seems appropriate.\n\nAdditionally, sometimes people might say they're good at something as a way of downplaying luck or external factors, even if they secretly believe otherwise. But again, based on the statement, it's his expressed belief that's in question.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Internal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
