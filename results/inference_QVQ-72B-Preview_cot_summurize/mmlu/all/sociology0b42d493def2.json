                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about income inequality in the 1980s. It's asking why there was a growth in income inequality during that time, and it gives four options. I need to pick the correct one. Let me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that rates of income tax increased equally for all occupational groups. Hmm, if income tax rates increased equally for everyone, that might affect the amount of take-home pay people get, but I'm not sure if that directly causes income inequality to grow. Maybe if higher-income earners are able to find ways to avoid some of those taxes, but the option says it increased equally for all. So, perhaps that's not the main reason.\n\nOption B says there were more professional jobs available but not enough people to fill them. That could lead to a situation where professionals' salaries go up because they're in high demand. If there aren't enough qualified people to fill those jobs, companies might have to pay higher wages to attract and keep talent. This could widen the gap between professionals and others who are in lower-paying jobs or unemployed. So, this seems like a possible reason for increased income inequality.\n\nOption C says the price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings. If the cost of living increases faster than people's wages, that means their purchasing power decreases. This could make it harder for people to make ends meet, especially those on lower incomes. However, does this directly contribute to income inequality? Maybe indirectly, but I'm not entirely sure if this is the primary reason for the growth in income inequality in the 1980s.\n\nOption D mentions growing unemployment made more people dependent on welfare benefits. During periods of high unemployment, more people might rely on government assistance programs. If these benefits are less than what they would earn in a job, this could lead to a wider gap between those who are employed and those who are not. So, this could also contribute to income inequality.\n\nBut between options B and D, which one is more directly responsible for the growth in income inequality in the 1980s? Let me think about the economic context of the 1980s. In the 1980s, there was a shift towards a service-based economy, with an increase in professional and technical jobs. At the same time, manufacturing jobs decreased, which might have affected middle-income earners. So, if there were more professional jobs but not enough people to fill them, that could drive up salaries in those sectors, widening the gap between professionals and others.\n\nAdditionally, during the 1980s, there was a period of recession in the early part of the decade, followed by an economic expansion. Unemployment was high in the early 1980s but decreased as the economy grew. So, while there was unemployment, the increase in professional jobs and the demand for skilled labor might have been a more significant factor in increasing income inequality.\n\nI think option B is the most accurate answer here. The demand for professionals outstripping the supply likely led to higher salaries for those jobs, thereby increasing the income gap between professionals and other occupational groups.\n\nWait a minute, but option D also seems plausible. Growing unemployment could make more people dependent on welfare, which might widen the income gap. However, I think that the increase in high-paying professional jobs without enough qualified people to fill them would have a more direct impact on increasing income inequality, as those jobs would command higher wages, further separating the incomes of professionals from other workers.\n\nSo, I'll go with option B as the primary reason for the growth in income inequality in the 1980s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
