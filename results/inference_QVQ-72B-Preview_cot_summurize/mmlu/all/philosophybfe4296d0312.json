Not of this world\n\nHmm, Plato was a ancient Greek philosopher, right? I think he had some specific ideas about beauty, maybe related to his theory of forms or something like that.\n\nLet me recall... Plato believed in this realm of forms or ideas, which are perfect, eternal, and unchanging. He thought that the physical world is just a shadow or a copy of the real world, which is the world of forms.\n\nSo, if I apply this to beauty, Plato might say that true beauty exists in the form of beauty itself, not in the physical objects we see around us. Because those physical objects are just imperfect copies of the ideal form.\n\nWait, so true beauty isn't found in everyday objects, because they're just copies of the ideal. So option A might not be correct.\n\nOption B says nonexistent. But that doesn't sound right either, because Plato did believe in the existence of forms, which are real and eternal. So true beauty does exist, just not in the physical world.\n\nOption C says everywhere in the natural world. Well, if true beauty is the ideal form, then it's not everywhere in the natural world, but rather in the realm of forms.\n\nOption D says not of this world. That seems to align with Plato's idea that the forms exist in a separate realm, not in the physical world we experience.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the answer is D. Not of this world.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I should think about some of his dialogues. Like in \"The Symposium,\" Plato discusses the idea of beauty and love. He talks about ascending from physical beauty to the beauty of the soul, and ultimately to the beauty of the forms.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. So, according to Plato, we can appreciate beauty in physical things, but that's just a reflection or a shadow of the true, ideal beauty that exists in the realm of forms.\n\nTherefore, true beauty is not of this world. It's in the realm of forms, which is separate from our physical reality.\n\nI think that's the correct understanding. So, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
