                    "text": "So Shodi earned 389 points in the first level of her video game and an additional 116 points in the bonus round. I need to find out the total points she earned from both parts. Okay, so I have to add 389 and 116 together.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the units place: 9 plus 6. 9 plus 6 is 15. So, that's 15 in the units place. Wait, no, actually, when adding two numbers, I should align them by place value and add column by column.\n\nLet me write it down like this:\n\n  389\n\n+ 116\n\n------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n9 (units) + 6 = 15. I'll write down the 5 and carry over the 1 to the tens place.\n\nNow, the tens place: 8 plus 1 is 9, and then adding the carried over 1 makes it 10. So, I'll write down the 0 and carry over the 1 to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place: 3 plus 1 is 4.\n\nSo, the total is 505.\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n9 + 6 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n\n8 + 1 (carried) = 9 \u2192 write 9\n\n3 + 0 (no carry from before, but just to be sure) = 3 \u2192 write 3\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try adding them again.\n\nActually, when adding 389 and 116:\n\nUnits: 9 + 6 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1\n\nTens: 8 + 1 (from 116) + 1 (carried over) = 10 \u2192 write 0, carry over 1\n\nHundreds: 3 + 1 (carried over) = 4\n\nSo, combining these, it's 405.\n\nWait a minute, but earlier I thought incorrectly. So, the correct total is 405, not 505.\n\nLet me verify this by another method. Maybe I'll add 300 + 100 = 400, then 80 + 10 = 90, and 9 + 6 = 15. Now, adding 400 + 90 + 15 equals 505. Hmm, but earlier I got 405.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me break it down again.\n\nFirst method:\n\n389\n\n+116\n\n------\n\nUnits: 9 + 6 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n\nTens: 8 + 1 + 1 = 10 \u2192 write 0, carry 1\n\nHundreds: 3 + 1 = 4\n\nSo, reading from left to right: 405\n\nSecond method:\n\n300 + 100 = 400\n\n80 + 10 = 90\n\n9 + 6 = 15\n\n400 + 90 = 490 + 15 = 505\n\nBut wait, 389 is 300 + 80 + 9, and 116 is 100 + 10 + 6.\n\nSo, adding them separately:\n\n300 + 100 = 400\n\n80 + 10 = 90\n\n9 + 6 = 15\n\nNow, 400 + 90 = 490 + 15 = 505\n\nBut according to the first method, I got 405. There's inconsistency here.\n\nI must have made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nLet me check the first method again.\n\nAdding 389 + 116:\n\nUnits: 9 + 6 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n\nTens: 8 + 1 (from 116) + 1 (carried over) = 10 \u2192 write 0, carry 1\n\nHundreds: 3 + 1 = 4\n\nSo, the number is 405.\n\nNow, looking back at the second method, perhaps I misadded.\n\n300 + 100 = 400\n\n80 + 10 = 90\n\n9 + 6 = 15\n\nNow, 400 + 90 = 490\n\n490 + 15 = 505\n\nBut according to the first correct method, it's 405. There must be something wrong with the second method's application.\n\nWait, no. Actually, I think I realized where I went wrong.\n\nIn the first method, adding 389 + 116:\n\nUnits: 9 + 6 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n\nTens: 8 + 1 + 1 = 10 \u2192 write 0, carry 1\n\nHundreds: 3 + 1 = 4\n\nSo, the total is 405.\n\nIn the second method, breaking it down into hundreds, tens, and units and adding separately, then summing up:\n\n400 + 90 + 15 = 505\n\nBut this is incorrect because it's treating the numbers as if they are being added separately, which isn't accurate.\n\nActually, the correct way is to add them digit by digit with carrying over, which gives 405.\n\nLet me verify this with a calculator, but since it's a manual problem, I'll assume the first method is correct.\n\nTherefore, the total points Shodi earned is 405.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 405\n\nB. 495\n\nC. 505\n\nD. 4,915\n\nSo, option A. 405 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{405} \\]"
