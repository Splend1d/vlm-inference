Securing the sustainable development of the state was dependent on societal security as an independent interest that was not secondary or dependent on the other sectors, including the military.\nB. The end of the Cold War allowed security studies to move beyond the confines of the dominant realist and neorealist perspectives, with an emerging interest in other, non-military, conceptions of security. Those who wished to broaden the scope of security studies advocated the inclusion of resource, environment, and other referent points for analysis.\nC. Societal security referred to the sustainable development of traditional patterns of military capabilities. Military threats could be subdivided to include the infrastructural strength, the technology, personnel, the economic base and the political base of the military security sector.\nD. Contemporary processes of globalization and societal conflict required the development of new conceptual tools beyond the state as the referent object. Security was dependent on factors beyond geographically conceived survival: survival of the state was superseded by survival of the nation (ethnic) state.\n"

Let's see, traditional security usually focuses on military threats and the sovereignty of the state, right? But Buzan seems to be expanding on that.\n\nOption A says that securing sustainable development of the state depends on societal security, which is an independent interest not secondary to other sectors like the military. So, it's suggesting that societal security is crucial and shouldn't be seen as less important than military security. That sounds like a shift from traditional views where military security might be prioritized over social aspects.\n\nOption B talks about how after the Cold War, security studies started to look beyond realist and neorealist perspectives and began considering non-military aspects like resources and the environment. This seems to align with Buzan's thoughts, as he might be advocating for a broader definition of security that includes more than just military might.\n\nOption C defines societal security as related to the sustainable development of traditional patterns of military capabilities. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. If societal security is about military capabilities, that almost sounds like it's still focused on military aspects, which contradicts the idea of broadening security beyond just military concerns. Maybe this isn't the best representation of Buzan's view.\n\nOption D mentions that contemporary processes like globalization and societal conflict require new conceptual tools beyond the state as the referent object. It also says that security is dependent on factors beyond geographical survival, and that the survival of the state is superseded by the survival of the nation or ethnic state. This seems to suggest that Buzan is moving away from the state-centric view of security to consider other factors like nationality and ethnicity.\n\nGiven these options, I think the one that best captures Buzan's concept of societal security as a departure from traditional understandings is Option A. It emphasizes that societal security is an independent interest, not secondary to other sectors, and is crucial for the sustainable development of the state. This contrasts with traditional security studies, which might prioritize military security over societal concerns.\n\nOption B is also relevant because it describes the shift in security studies after the Cold War, which likely influenced Buzan's thinking. However, it's more about the general trend in security studies rather than specifically about Buzan's concept.\n\nOption C seems to confuse societal security with military capabilities, which doesn't align with the idea of broadening security studies to include non-military aspects.\n\nOption D touches on Buzan's thoughts about moving beyond the state as the sole referent object, but it also mentions the survival of the nation or ethnic state, which might not fully capture the concept of societal security.\n\nTherefore, I believe Option A is the most accurate description of how Buzan's concept of societal security marks a departure from traditional understandings of security.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
