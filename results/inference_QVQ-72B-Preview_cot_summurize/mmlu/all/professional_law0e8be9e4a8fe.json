                    "text": "So I've got this real estate situation here, and I need to figure out who's in the right. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nFirst, there's a buyer and a man who supposedly owns a tract of land. They signed a real estate sales contract on August 18, 2009, saying that the man will sell the land to the buyer for $175,000, and he has to convey \"good and marketable title\" within 60 days from that date.\n\nOkay, so the closing was supposed to be around October 17, 2009, give or take a day or two, since 60 days from August 18 is October 17.\n\nBut on October 11, 2009, before the closing, the buyer called the man and said that according to the title search, a third party is the owner of record. The man responded that even though that's the case, he's been in adverse possession for 21 years.\n\nNow, in this jurisdiction, the statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years. So, the man has been in adverse possession for 21 years, which is one year longer than required by law.\n\nThe next day, the buyer did some more investigating and confirmed that the man has indeed been in adverse possession for 21 years.\n\nAt the time of closing, the man offered a deed as agreed in the contract, but the buyer refused to pay or take possession because the man couldn't convey \"good and marketable title.\"\n\nNow, the man is suing the buyer for specific performance, which means he wants the buyer to go through with the purchase as per the contract.\n\nI need to figure out whether the man will prevail in this action.\n\nFirst, let's recall what adverse possession is. Adverse possession is a doctrine under which a person who doesn't have legal title to a piece of property can acquire legal ownership by possessing it openly, continuously, and exclusively for a certain period, defined by statute.\n\nIn this case, the statutory period is 20 years, and the man has been in adverse possession for 21 years. So, he has likely acquired title to the property through adverse possession.\n\nBut the issue is that the record still shows a third party as the owner. So, even though the man may have title through adverse possession, the buyer's concern is that the title isn't \"good and marketable.\"\n\nThe contract requires the man to convey \"good and marketable title.\" So, the question is, does the man's title qualify as good and marketable?\n\nI think I need to understand what \"good and marketable title\" means in this context.\n\nGenerally, a good and marketable title is one that is free from defects or reasonable doubts, and that can be readily transferred to a buyer without risk of litigation or other challenges.\n\nGiven that there's a third party who is still shown as the owner of record, there might be some doubt about the title's validity, especially since the man's claim is based on adverse possession.\n\nBut, since the man has been in adverse possession for 21 years, which is beyond the statutory period of 20 years, his title should be considered valid and marketable.\n\nWait, but the record still shows the third party as the owner. Does that mean there's a cloud on the title?\n\nMaybe the man needs to take some additional steps to clear the title or to have the third party's interest extinguished.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, once the adverse possession period has lapsed, the adverse possessor can bring an action to quiet title, which is a legal process to establish their ownership and remove any clouds on the title.\n\nPerhaps the man hasn't done that yet, which is why the record still shows the third party as the owner.\n\nSo, in this situation, does the man's title qualify as \"good and marketable\"?\n\nOption A says that the man will prevail because he has obtained \"good and marketable title\" by adverse possession.\n\nBut the buyer is arguing that the title isn't good and marketable because of the third party's recorded interest.\n\nOption B says that the man will prevail because his action for specific performance is an action in rem to which the third party is not a necessary party.\n\nI'm not entirely sure about this option. An action in rem is against a thing, rather than a person, and it often involves real property.\n\nBut in this case, the third party is potentially an interested party, and their interests might need to be considered.\n\nOption C says that the man will not prevail because an adverse possessor takes title subject to an equitable lien from the dispossessed owner.\n\nI need to check if that's accurate.\n\nAn equitable lien is a claim against property to secure a debt or obligation.\n\nI'm not sure if that applies here. If the man has acquired title by adverse possession, the third party's interest should be extinguished, provided that all the elements of adverse possession have been met.\n\nBut perhaps there are exceptions or specific rules regarding equitable liens in this context.\n\nOption D says that the man will not prevail because the buyer cannot be required to buy a lawsuit even if the probability is great that the buyer would prevail against the man.\n\nThis seems to suggest that the buyer is concerned about potential litigation with the third party over the title.\n\nIf the title isn't clear, the buyer might be taking on the risk of future legal challenges to their ownership.\n\nSo, the buyer doesn't want to buy a property that could lead to lawsuits down the line.\n\nGiven that, I need to consider whether the man's title is sufficiently clear and marketable.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, once the adverse possession period has been satisfied, the adverse possessor's title is considered valid and marketable.\n\nHowever, there might be some residual risks or uncertainties that could affect the title's marketability.\n\nFor example, if the third party claims that they never received proper notice of the adverse possession or if there are any other extenuating circumstances.\n\nBut in this scenario, it's stated that the man has been in adverse possession for 21 years, which is one year beyond the statutory period.\n\nAssuming that all other requirements for adverse possession have been met (like continuous, exclusive, open, and hostile possession), then the man should have a valid title.\n\nHowever, the fact that the record still shows the third party as the owner might indicate that there's some confusion or that the title hasn't been properly cleared.\n\nPerhaps the man needs to record his claim of adverse possession or obtain a court order to quiet title.\n\nIn the absence of such actions, the buyer might be rightfully concerned about the title's clarity.\n\nOn the other hand, if the man can prove his adverse possession, the buyer might be obligated to go through with the purchase, as the man has met the contractual obligation to convey good and marketable title.\n\nWait, but the buyer's concern is that the title isn't marketable because of the third party's recorded interest.\n\nSo, perhaps the man needs to take steps to clear the title before expecting the buyer to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the contract's requirement of \"good and marketable title\" is subject to the man's ability to prove his adverse possession.\n\nIn that case, if the man can prove his adverse possession, his title should be considered good and marketable.\n\nBut the buyer seems to disagree, perhaps because the record still shows the third party as the owner.\n\nI think the key here is whether the man's adverse possession is sufficient to convey a good and marketable title.\n\nIf the law recognizes his adverse possession as conferring valid title, then the buyer should be bound by that.\n\nHowever, if there are lingering issues with the title, such as the third party's recorded interest, the buyer might have a valid concern.\n\nOption A suggests that the man will prevail because he has obtained \"good and marketable title\" by adverse possession.\n\nBut given that the buyer is refusing because of the third party's recorded interest, maybe the title isn't considered good and marketable.\n\nOption D suggests that the buyer shouldn't be forced to buy a property with a cloudy title, even if the man's claim is strong.\n\nI think that makes sense from the buyer's perspective.\n\nBut legally, if the man has met the requirements for adverse possession, his title should be valid.\n\nPerhaps the court would require the man to take additional steps to clear the title before ordering specific performance.\n\nAlternatively, the court might order specific performance and require the man to indemnify the buyer against any future claims related to the title.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nLet me see if I can find some case law or statutory guidance on this.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, once the adverse possession period has lapsed, the adverse possessor is deemed to have acquired title to the property.\n\nMoreover, in some places, the adverse possessor's title is considered equal to that of any other owner, provided that all the elements of adverse possession have been satisfied.\n\nHowever, there might be issues with recording the title or ensuring that all parties have been properly notified.\n\nIn this scenario, since the man has been in adverse possession for 21 years, which is beyond the 20-year statutory period, it seems that he has a strong claim to the property.\n\nBut the buyer is still hesitant because of the third party's recorded interest.\n\nPerhaps the man needs to bring a quiet title action to resolve any disputes or clouds on the title.\n\nA quiet title action is a lawsuit in which the owner seeks a court declaration that they are the rightful owner and that any other claims against the title are invalid.\n\nIf the man were to bring such an action and prevail, then his title would be clear, and the buyer's concerns would be addressed.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, it seems that the man hasn't taken that step yet.\n\nSo, at the time of closing, the title still shows the third party as the owner, which is a problem for the buyer.\n\nThe buyer is refusing to go through with the purchase because of this issue.\n\nIn such a situation, would the court order specific performance?\n\nI think it depends on whether the man's title is considered good and marketable under the circumstances.\n\nIf the court determines that the man's adverse possession is valid and that his title is marketable, despite the third party's recorded interest, then the buyer would be required to go through with the purchase.\n\nOn the other hand, if the court agrees with the buyer that the title isn't marketable due to the third party's interest, then the buyer wouldn't be required to complete the purchase.\n\nGiven that, I need to consider what \"good and marketable title\" means in this context.\n\nGenerally, a marketable title is one that a reasonably prudent buyer would accept, without any defects that would make the title questionable.\n\nIn this case, the fact that the third party is still shown as the owner on record might be a defect that a reasonable buyer would not accept.\n\nTherefore, the buyer might have a valid reason to refuse the purchase.\n\nHowever, if the man can prove his adverse possession and show that his title is valid, the buyer might still be required to go through with the purchase.\n\nBut the buyer's position is that they don't want to buy a property with a cloudy title, even if the man's claim is strong.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, the buyer doesn't want to inherit potential legal issues down the line.\n\nSo, perhaps the court would not order specific performance in this case, given the uncertainty surrounding the title.\n\nOption D seems to align with this reasoning.\n\nIt suggests that the buyer cannot be required to buy a lawsuit, meaning that they shouldn't be forced to purchase a property with a title that could lead to legal disputes.\n\nEven if the probability is high that the buyer would prevail against the man in any future litigation, the buyer still doesn't want to take on that risk.\n\nTherefore, option D seems like a plausible answer.\n\nHowever, option A suggests that the man will prevail because he has obtained \"good and marketable title\" by adverse possession.\n\nBut given the buyer's concerns about the third party's recorded interest, it's unlikely that the court would consider the title good and marketable.\n\nTherefore, option A is probably incorrect.\n\nOption B says that the man will prevail because his action for specific performance is an action in rem to which the third party is not a necessary party.\n\nI'm not sure about this.\n\nAn action in rem is against the property itself, and typically, all parties with an interest in the property should be joined in the action.\n\nIn this case, the third party might have an interest in the property, so perhaps they should be a party to the action.\n\nBut maybe the action is only between the buyer and the man, and the third party isn't directly involved.\n\nI'm not entirely sure about this, but it seems a bit tangential to the main issue.\n\nOption C says that the man will not prevail because an adverse possessor takes title subject to an equitable lien from the dispossessed owner.\n\nI need to check if that's accurate.\n\nGenerally, when a person acquires title by adverse possession, they take the property free from most liens and encumbrances, except for those that are attached to the land itself, like taxes or recorded easements.\n\nHowever, there might be exceptions or specific rules regarding equitable liens.\n\nAn equitable lien is a claim against property to secure a debt or obligation.\n\nI don't think that adverse possession typically results in the possessor taking title subject to an equitable lien from the former owner.\n\nUnless there are specific circumstances where the former owner has some claim against the property, I would think that the adverse possessor's title is clear of such liens.\n\nBut I might be wrong.\n\nLet me see.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, if the former owner has some unpaid debts or claims against the property, those might survive adverse possession, but it's not a general rule.\n\nI think option C is likely incorrect.\n\nTherefore, between options A, D, and possibly B, option D seems the most plausible.\n\nIt reflects the buyer's concern about taking on a property with a cloudy title, even if the man's claim is strong.\n\nThe buyer doesn't want to be stuck with potential legal issues down the line.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D: not prevail, because the buyer cannot be required to buy a lawsuit even if the probability is great that the buyer would prevail against the man.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
