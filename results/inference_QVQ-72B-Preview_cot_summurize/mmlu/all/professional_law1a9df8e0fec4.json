The caller furnished the police with the address where the disturbance was taking place. When the police arrived at the home, they discovered the homeowner, bludgeoned to death. The murder weapon was a blood-stained baseball bat found near the victim's body. A subsequent investigation revealed that the homeowner had recently been separated from her husband who had since moved to another city.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this legal scenario. It's pretty detailed, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a phone call from an unidentified woman who hears loud noises from a neighboring home. The police go to the address she provided and find the homeowner bludgeoned to death with a blood-stained baseball bat nearby. After some investigation, they suspect the husband, who had recently moved to another city due to a separation.\n\nTwo detectives go to question the husband at his apartment. They convince the landlord to let them in, even though the husband isn't home. They search the apartment and take a box of cereal to compare fingerprints. These fingerprints match those found on the baseball bat.\n\nThe police present this fingerprint comparison to the grand jury, which is investigating the murder. The husband is subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury but files a motion to suppress the evidence of the fingerprint comparison, arguing that it was illegally obtained.\n\nNow, I need to determine whether his motion should be granted or denied based on the options provided.\n\nOption A says the motion should be granted because the warrantless search of the husband's apartment was unconstitutional.\n\nOption B says it should be granted because the grand jury is barred from considering illegally obtained evidence.\n\nOption C says it should be denied because the exclusionary rule hasn't been extended to grand jury hearings.\n\nOption D says it should be denied because the landlord had apparent authority to authorize the search of the husband's apartment.\n\nAlright, let's analyze this.\n\nFirst, was the search of the husband's apartment legal?\n\nGenerally, searches require a warrant unless there's an exception, like consent or exigent circumstances.\n\nIn this case, the detectives persuaded the landlord to let them in. Did the landlord have the authority to consent to the search?\n\nWell, landlords typically don't have the authority to consent to searches of tenants' apartments unless they have the tenant's permission or unless the lease agreement allows it.\n\nBut there's a concept called \"apparent authority.\" If the police reasonably believe that the landlord has the authority to consent to the search, then the search might be valid based on that apparent authority.\n\nHowever, I think landlords generally don't have the actual authority to consent to searches of their tenants' apartments without the tenant's consent.\n\nSo, if the detectives relied on the landlord's consent to enter and search the apartment without a warrant or the husband's consent, that might be a problem.\n\nBut, option D suggests that the landlord had apparent authority, so perhaps the search was valid based on that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there were other reasons for the search, like exigent circumstances, but the scenario doesn't mention any emergencies or immediate threats that would justify a warrantless search.\n\nSo, option A suggests that the motion should be granted because the warrantless search was unconstitutional.\n\nBut wait, even if the search was unconstitutional, is the evidence from that search suppressible in a grand jury proceeding?\n\nThat brings us to option C, which says the exclusionary rule hasn't been extended to grand jury hearings.\n\nThe exclusionary rule is a doctrine that prevents illegally obtained evidence from being used in criminal trials. But does it apply to grand jury proceedings?\n\nGrand juries are different from trial proceedings. They're used to determine whether there's enough evidence to indict someone and go to trial.\n\nHistorically, the exclusionary rule hasn't been applied as strictly in grand jury proceedings as it is in trials.\n\nIn fact, I recall that the Supreme Court has held that the exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence presented to a grand jury.\n\nSo, even if the evidence was obtained illegally, the grand jury can still consider it for the purpose of deciding whether to indict.\n\nTherefore, option C suggests that the motion should be denied because the exclusionary rule hasn't been extended to grand jury hearings.\n\nThat seems plausible.\n\nOption B says the motion should be granted because the grand jury is barred from considering illegally obtained evidence.\n\nBut, as I just thought, that doesn't align with my understanding of the law. Grand juries can consider such evidence.\n\nOption D says the motion should be denied because the landlord had apparent authority to authorize the search.\n\nWhile that's a possible argument, I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of landlord authority in this context.\n\nMaybe the detectives reasonably believed the landlord had the right to let them in, but I think tenants generally have privacy rights that protect them from warrantless searches by landlords.\n\nSo, perhaps the search was invalid, but since the exclusionary rule doesn't apply to grand jury proceedings, the evidence can still be used there.\n\nTherefore, the motion to suppress would be denied, not because the search was valid, but because the exclusionary rule doesn't apply in this context.\n\nSo, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the search was indeed unconstitutional, as option A suggests, but the evidence is still admissible in grand jury proceedings due to the non-application of the exclusionary rule, then option C is the right choice.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the grand jury can consider illegally obtained evidence.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, even if the search was unconstitutional, the evidence can still be used in grand jury proceedings.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, while the search might have been valid based on apparent authority, that's not the main issue here. The key point is that the exclusionary rule doesn't apply to grand jury hearings.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. denied, because the exclusionary rule has not been extended to grand jury hearings.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
