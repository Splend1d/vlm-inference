                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here: \"Who originally proposed the idea of daylight-saving time? A. Benjamin Franklin B. Henry David Thoreau C. Galileo D. Albert Einstein.\" Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out who came up with the idea of daylight-saving time from these options.\n\nFirst off, I know that daylight-saving time is when we set our clocks ahead by an hour during the summer months to make better use of the longer days. It's supposed to help save energy because people can take advantage of natural light later in the day. But who came up with this idea?\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Benjamin Franklin: He was an American polymath, inventor, statesman, and diplomat. He's famous for many inventions and ideas, like the lightning rod and bifocal glasses. I seem to recall that he wrote something about saving daylight, maybe in a letter or an article. Let me try to remember the details.\n\nB. Henry David Thoreau: He was an American essayist, poet, and philosopher. He's best known for his book \"Walden,\" which is about living simply in nature. While he was interested in nature and the environment, I don't recall him proposing anything specifically related to daylight-saving time.\n\nC. Galileo: He was an Italian astronomer, physicist, and engineer who made significant contributions to the scientific revolution. He's famous for his work in astronomy, physics, and mathematics. I don't think he had anything to do with daylight-saving time.\n\nD. Albert Einstein: He was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. He's also known for his mass-energy equivalence formula, E=mc\u00b2. While he was a genius, I don't remember him proposing daylight-saving time.\n\nSo, based on what I know, Benjamin Franklin seems like the most plausible option. I think he was the one who first proposed the idea of daylight-saving time. Let me see if I can recall any specific details to confirm this.\n\nI think Franklin was inspired by the longer days in Paris, where he was serving as the United States' ambassador. He noticed that people were waking up late and burning candles all day, which he considered wasteful. He suggested that if people adjusted their schedules to rise earlier with the sun, they could save on candle usage.\n\nIn fact, I believe he wrote a letter to a French newspaper proposing this idea. The letter was humorous in tone, suggesting that people should get up earlier to save on candles by using natural light. While it was meant to be satirical, it laid the groundwork for the concept of daylight-saving time.\n\nNow, I should check if any of the other options have a connection to daylight-saving time that I might have forgotten.\n\nHenry David Thoreau was known for his observations of nature and the passage of time, but I don't think he proposed any system for adjusting clocks to save energy or make better use of daylight.\n\nGalileo lived in the 16th and 17th centuries, long before the concept of daylight-saving time was relevant. His work was more focused on astronomy and physics, not on timekeeping for energy savings.\n\nAlbert Einstein, while a brilliant physicist, was active in the early 20th century, well after the concept of daylight-saving time was first proposed.\n\nTherefore, based on my knowledge, Benjamin Franklin is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, I should make sure that there isn't someone else who is credited with inventing daylight-saving time. I think that while Franklin proposed the idea of saving daylight, the actual implementation of daylight-saving time came later, in the 20th century.\n\nLet me double-check this. I recall that the first implementation of daylight-saving time was in Germany during World War I to conserve coal. Other countries followed suit, including the United States in 1918.\n\nBut in terms of the original proposal, it was indeed Benjamin Franklin who first suggested the idea of adjusting schedules to make better use of natural light.\n\nSo, to answer the question, the original proposer of the idea of daylight-saving time was Benjamin Franklin.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Benjamin Franklin}} \\]"
