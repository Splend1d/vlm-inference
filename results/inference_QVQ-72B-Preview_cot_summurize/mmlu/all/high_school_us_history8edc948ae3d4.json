When we found the last Summer that we were likely to get no Assistance from the Government, some Volunteers went out at our own Expense, determined to drive our Enemies from our Borders; & when we came near to the great Island, we understood that a Number of their Warriors had gone out against our Frontiers. Upon this we returned and came up with them and fought with them at the Munfey Hill where we lost some of our Men & killed some of their Warriors & thereby saved our Frontiers from this Story in another Expedition. But no sooner had we destroyed their Provisions on the great Island, & ruined their trade with the good People at Bethlehem, but these very Indians, who were justly suspected of having murdered our Friends in Northampton County, were by the Influence of some Quakers taken under the Protection of the Government to screen them from the Resentments of the Friends and Relations of the Murdered, & to support them thro the Winter.\"\n\u2014\"Apology of the Paxton Boys\" (pamphlet), 1764 (Note: \"apology\" in this context should be read as an explanation, not an admission of guilt or regret.)\nWhich of the following events from either earlier or later in the colonial period can best be seen as being part of a continuity with the events described in the passage above?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this passage from the \"Apology of the Paxton Boys\" from 1764, and I need to find an event from either earlier or later in the colonial period that continues with what's described here. The options are the expulsion of Anne Hutchinson, Bacon's Rebellion, the Boston Tea Party, and the trial of John Peter Zenger.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Paxton Boys were apologizing for or explaining. The title says \"apology,\" but it's clarified that it's more of an explanation, not an admission of guilt. So, they're trying to justify their actions.\n\nFrom the passage, it seems like there was some conflict involving the Paxton Boys, Quakers, Indians, and the government. There's talk about driving enemies from their borders,\u5fd7\u613f\u8005 going out at their own expense, fighting at Munfey Hill, and losing men. There's also mention of Quakers being attached to Indians and protecting them, which caused resentment among the Paxton Boys.\n\nSo, the Paxton Boys are presenting their side of the story, probably in response to criticism or different interpretations of their actions. They seem to be defending their treatment of the Indians and criticizing the Quakers for supporting the Indians.\n\nNow, I need to look at each option and see which one fits into a continuity with this situation.\n\nOption A: The expulsion of Anne Hutchinson from Massachusetts Bay Colony.\n\nI remember that Anne Hutchinson was expelled from the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1638 for her unorthodox religious views, particularly her belief in antinomianism, which suggested that true Christians were guided by direct inspiration from the Holy Spirit rather than by church leaders or written law.\n\nThis seems quite different from the Paxton Boys' situation, which involves intercolonial conflicts, Indian relations, and Quaker involvement. While both involve conflicts within colonial society, the Hutchinson episode is more about religious freedom and authority, whereas the Paxton Boys' issue is about frontier violence and relations with Native Americans.\n\nMaybe there's a connection in terms of challenges to authority or societal norms, but it doesn't seem as direct as some of the other options.\n\nOption B: Bacon's Rebellion in colonial Virginia.\n\nBacon's Rebellion was in 1676, led by Nathaniel Bacon against the governor, Sir William Berkeley. It was fueled by tensions over Indian relations, economic grievances, and power struggles within Virginia's government.\n\nThis seems more relevant. Like the Paxton Boys, Bacon and his followers were\u4e0d\u6ee1 with the government's handling of Indian relations. They wanted more aggressive actions against the Native Americans, whom they blamed for raids on their settlements.\n\nIn both cases, there's a conflict between frontier settlers and the colonial government over how to handle Native American relations. The settlers feel that the government isn't protecting them or is too lenient towards the Indians, leading them to take matters into their own hands.\n\nThis seems like a strong continuity. Both Bacon's Rebellion and the Paxton Boys' actions were driven by frontier tensions and disagreements over Indian policy.\n\nOption C: The Boston Tea Party.\n\nThe Boston Tea Party was in 1773, where colonists dressed as Mohawks dumped tea into Boston Harbor to protest British taxation without representation. It's a well-known event in the lead-up to the American Revolution.\n\nWhile it involves colonial resistance and protest against authority, it's more about taxation and political representation rather than frontier conflicts or Indian relations.\n\nThere might be a general theme of resistance to authority, but it's not directly related to the frontier issues and Indian relations that are central to the Paxton Boys' situation.\n\nOption D: The trial of John Peter Zenger.\n\nJohn Peter Zenger was a newspaper printer in New York who was tried for seditious libel in 1735 for criticizing the governor. His trial was significant because it helped establish the right to freedom of the press in the colonies.\n\nThis event is more about press freedom and the limits of free speech, which doesn't directly relate to the frontier conflicts and Indian relations in the Paxton Boys' situation.\n\nWhile both involve challenges to authority, the Zenger trial is more about legal and journalistic freedom, whereas the Paxton Boys' issue is about violent conflict and intercolonial relations.\n\nComparing all the options, Bacon's Rebellion seems to have the closest continuity with the Paxton Boys' situation. Both involve frontier settlers rising up against the colonial government over perceptions of inadequate protection and overly conciliatory policies towards Native Americans.\n\nThe other options touch on themes of resistance and conflict within colonial society but don't align as closely with the specific issues of frontier defense and Indian policy.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B. Bacon's Rebellion in colonial Virginia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
