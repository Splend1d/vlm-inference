                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find the solid angle subtended by an area of 2400 cm\u00b2 on the surface of a sphere with a diameter of 1.2 meters. The options are A. 3/2, B. 1/3, C. 2/3, and D. 2/5. I'm a bit rusty on solid angles, but I remember that solid angles are measured in steradians, and there's a formula that relates the area on the surface of a sphere to the solid angle.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the solid angle (\u03a9) subtended by an area (A) on the surface of a sphere at the center. I think it's \u03a9 = A / r\u00b2, where r is the radius of the sphere. Let me confirm that. Yes, that seems right; it's a standard formula in spherical geometry.\n\nSo, \u03a9 = A / r\u00b2.\n\nGiven that, I have A = 2400 cm\u00b2 and the diameter of the sphere is 1.2 meters. I should convert all units to be consistent. Let's convert the area to square meters since the diameter is in meters.\n\n1 cm\u00b2 = 0.0001 m\u00b2, so 2400 cm\u00b2 = 2400 * 0.0001 = 0.24 m\u00b2.\n\nNow, the diameter is 1.2 meters, so the radius r = diameter / 2 = 1.2 / 2 = 0.6 meters.\n\nPlugging into the formula, \u03a9 = A / r\u00b2 = 0.24 / (0.6)\u00b2 = 0.24 / 0.36 = 0.666... which is 2/3.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let's double-check if there's any trick here.\n\nIs the area given on the surface of the sphere or is it a projected area? The problem says \"on the surface of a sphere,\" so I think it's the actual surface area.\n\nAlso, the options include 2/3, which matches my calculation. But let's see if there's any other consideration I might have missed.\n\nIs the solid angle measured in steradians? Yes, steradians are the standard unit for solid angles in the SI system.\n\nLet me think about the total solid angle for a full sphere. I believe it's 4\u03c0 steradians. So, if my calculation is correct, the subtended solid angle should be less than 4\u03c0, which 2/3 is indeed less than that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the geometry more carefully. If the area is on the surface of the sphere, and it's centered at the center, then the formula \u03a9 = A / r\u00b2 should hold.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider? Maybe the shape of the area. The problem doesn't specify the shape, just the area in cm\u00b2. Assuming it's a general area, the formula should still apply.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the definition of solid angle. It's the area projected on the sphere divided by the square of the radius, which is exactly what I've used.\n\nLet me try another approach to confirm. Suppose I have a sphere of radius r, and an area A on its surface. The solid angle \u03a9 subtended at the center is indeed A / r\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula involving the angle in spherical coordinates, but that might be more complicated for this problem.\n\nGiven that, I think my initial calculation is correct. So, the answer should be 2/3, which is option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any unit conversion error. I converted 2400 cm\u00b2 to 0.24 m\u00b2, which is correct, and the radius is 0.6 m, squared is 0.36 m\u00b2, and 0.24 / 0.36 = 2/3.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 2/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{3}} \\]"
