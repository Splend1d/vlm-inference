                    "text": "So I need to find out the worldwide prevalence of obesity. The options are 11%, 13%, 15%, and 39%. Hmm, I'm not sure about the exact number, but I think obesity is a pretty big issue globally. Let me see if I can recall any statistics from what I've heard or read.\n\nI remember that according to the World Health Organization (WHO), obesity has become a global epidemic. They might have some data on this. Let me try to recall what they might have reported. I think in their latest reports, the global adult obesity prevalence was around 13% or something like that. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me consider other sources. Maybe I can think about the trends over time. I know that obesity rates have been increasing over the past few decades. For example, in the United States, the obesity rate is higher than many other countries, maybe around 40% or so. But that's just one country.\n\nFor worldwide statistics, I need to look at data from multiple countries combined. Perhaps there are global surveys or studies that provide this information. I recall that the WHO publishes data on global health indicators, including body mass index (BMI) and obesity prevalence.\n\nLet me try to recall if there's a specific year or report that mentioned the global obesity rate. Maybe it was in a news article or a documentary I watched recently.\n\nWait, I think I remember seeing a chart that showed the global obesity prevalence was around 13% for adults. Yeah, that seems familiar. But I should make sure because I don't want to pick the wrong answer.\n\nLet me consider the options again: 11%, 13%, 15%, and 39%. If I had to guess, I'd say 13% because that's what I seem to recall from WHO reports. But maybe I'm misremembering.\n\nPerhaps I should think about the regional obesity rates. For instance, in Europe, the obesity rates vary by country, with some countries having higher rates than others. Similarly, in Asia, some countries have lower obesity rates, while others have higher ones.\n\nConsidering that obesity is a significant public health issue worldwide, it's likely that the global prevalence is substantial, but not extremely high. So, 39% seems too high, as that would imply that almost two out of every five adults are obese, which I don't think is the case globally.\n\nOn the other hand, 11% seems a bit low. That would mean only about one in nine adults are obese worldwide, which doesn't align with what I've heard about rising obesity rates.\n\n15% might be possible, but I think that's a bit high. I seem to recall that the global obesity rate is just over 10%, maybe around 13%. Let me see if I can confirm this.\n\nWait, maybe I can think about the definition of obesity. Obesity is typically defined as having a BMI of 30 or higher. BMI is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. So, it's a standard measure used worldwide.\n\nGiven that BMI is a universal standard, the global obesity rate should be comparable across countries, adjusted for population sizes.\n\nI think the WHO publishes data on global obesity rates periodically. Maybe their latest report from 2016 or 2018 mentioned the prevalence.\n\nLet me try to recall if there was a specific number in their reports. I think they might have said that in 2016, the global adult obesity prevalence was around 13%. Yeah, that sounds familiar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm confusing it with another statistic. Perhaps the global overweight prevalence, which includes both overweight and obese categories, is higher, around 39% or something.\n\nBut no, the question is specifically about obesity, not overweight.\n\nLet me double-check my memory. If I recall correctly, in 2016, the WHO reported that 13% of adults worldwide were obese. So, that would make the answer 13%.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any newer data that might have updated this figure. Maybe there's been an increase since then.\n\nI think that in their latest reports, the global obesity rate is still around 13%. It hasn't changed drastically in a short period.\n\nTherefore, based on my recollection of WHO reports, the worldwide prevalence of obesity is approximately 13%.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. 13%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
