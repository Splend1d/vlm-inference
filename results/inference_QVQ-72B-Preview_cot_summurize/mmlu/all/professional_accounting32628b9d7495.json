                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about ordering (risk, return) pairs for investments. The pairs are (2,2), (2,3), and (4,2). Risk is measured in standard deviations, and return is in percentage. I'm supposed to order them from least to most favorable for a rational, risk-averse investor.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"risk-averse\" means. It means that the investor doesn't like taking risks and prefers investments that are less risky for a given level of return. So, they would prefer investments that offer higher returns with lower risks.\n\nNow, looking at the pairs:\n\n- (2,2): risk = 2 standard deviations, return = 2%.\n\n- (2,3): risk = 2 standard deviations, return = 3%.\n\n- (4,2): risk = 4 standard deviations, return = 2%.\n\nI should compare these based on both risk and return.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, compare (2,2) and (2,3). Both have the same risk of 2 standard deviations, but different returns. Since higher return is better for the same risk, (2,3) is better than (2,2).\n\nNext, compare (2,2) and (4,2). Both have the same return of 2%, but different risks. Since lower risk is better for the same return, (2,2) is better than (4,2).\n\nNow, compare (2,3) and (4,2). (2,3) has lower risk (2 vs. 4) and higher return (3% vs. 2%). So, (2,3) is better than (4,2).\n\nPutting them in order from least to most favorable:\n\n1. (2,3): lowest risk for the highest return.\n\n2. (2,2): same risk as (2,3), but lower return.\n\n3. (4,2): higher risk and same return as (2,2).\n\nSo, the order should be (2,3), (2,2), (4,2).\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let's think about it again to make sure.\n\nIn finance, a risk-averse investor would prefer:\n\n- Higher returns for the same level of risk.\n\n- Lower risk for the same level of return.\n\nSo, between (2,2) and (2,3), since risk is the same, higher return is better, so (2,3) is preferred over (2,2).\n\nBetween (2,2) and (4,2), since return is the same, lower risk is better, so (2,2) is preferred over (4,2).\n\nBetween (2,3) and (4,2), both have different risks and returns. (2,3) has higher return and lower risk, so it's clearly better.\n\nTherefore, the most favorable is (2,3), followed by (2,2), and least favorable is (4,2).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. (4,2),(2,2),(2,3)\n\nB. (2,2),(2,3),(4,2)\n\nC. (2,2),(4,2),(2,3)\n\nD. (2,3),(2,2),(4,2)\n\nMy ordering matches option D: (2,3),(2,2),(4,2).\n\nBut wait, the question asks to order from least to most favorable. So, the least favorable should be first, and the most favorable should be last.\n\nWait, no. The question says \"from least to most favorable\", meaning start with the least favorable and end with the most favorable.\n\nSo, the order should be from least favorable to most favorable.\n\nAccording to my earlier reasoning, (4,2) is the least favorable, then (2,2), and (2,3) is the most favorable.\n\nSo, the correct order is (4,2), (2,2), (2,3).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. (4,2),(2,2),(2,3)\n\nB. (2,2),(2,3),(4,2)\n\nC. (2,2),(4,2),(2,3)\n\nD. (2,3),(2,2),(4,2)\n\nOption A matches the correct order: (4,2), (2,2), (2,3).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought (2,3) was the best, but the question is to order from least to most favorable, meaning starting with the least favorable.\n\nSo, option A is correct.\n\nBut I think I need to double-check my understanding.\n\nLet me consider the concept again. For a risk-averse investor:\n\n- If two investments have the same risk, choose the one with higher return.\n\n- If two investments have the same return, choose the one with lower risk.\n\nApplying this:\n\n- Compare (2,2) and (2,3): same risk, higher return for (2,3), so (2,3) is better.\n\n- Compare (2,2) and (4,2): same return, lower risk for (2,2), so (2,2) is better than (4,2).\n\n- Compare (2,3) and (4,2): (2,3) has higher return and lower risk, so (2,3) is better.\n\nWait, but the question is to order from least to most favorable, meaning from worst to best.\n\nSo, the worst is (4,2), then (2,2), then (2,3).\n\nTherefore, the order is (4,2), (2,2), (2,3), which corresponds to option A.\n\nI think I was confused earlier about whether the order is from best to worst or worst to best. The question specifies \"from least to most favorable\", which means from least favorable (worst) to most favorable (best).\n\nSo, option A is correct.\n\nTo confirm, the least favorable is (4,2), then (2,2), and most favorable is (2,3).\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. (4,2),(2,2),(2,3)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
