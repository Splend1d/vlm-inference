I remember three of them: instrumentally-rational, value-rational, traditional, and one more that has to do with emotions or affects. Let me see, the options are affectual, affective, effective, and infected. Hmm, infected seems out of place; that can't be it. So, probably between affectual and affective.\n\nI think \"affective\" is the right term. It refers to actions driven by emotions or feelings. Let me double-check. Instrumentally-rational is about means to an end, value-rational is about pursuing beliefs or principles, traditional is based on customs and habits, and then there's affective, which is based on emotional states or impulses.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. So, the answer should be B. affective.\n\nWait, but option C is effective, which is different. Effective would imply something about efficiency or impact, but that's not one of Weber's ideal types. And option A is affectual, which sounds similar to affective but might be a different concept. I think affectual might refer to something related to affection or relationships, but I'm not sure.\n\nNo, I'm pretty confident that the fourth type is affective. So, the correct choice is B. affective.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
