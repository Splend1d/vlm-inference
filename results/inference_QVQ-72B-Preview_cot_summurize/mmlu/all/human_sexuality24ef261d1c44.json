                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question about Benny, who's a successful corporation head. He has a stressful day at work and then goes home to his wife, who spanks him, ties him up, and teases him until he begs for intercourse. The question is asking, according to psychological theory, what's the most likely reason Benny finds this alluring. There are four options:\n\nA. As a child, he became sexually aroused pretending to be a powerful executive, so now he gets aroused at work and needs to discharge this when he gets home.\n\nB. He's overcome with feelings of self-doubt, and his sadomasochistic behavior provides a safe outlet for that self-doubt.\n\nC. He's overwhelmed with pressures and responsibilities at work, and the masochistic behavior allows him to escape from being an autonomous, separate individual.\n\nD. He's secretly fascinated by violence, and engaging in sadomasochistic behavior is a relatively safe outlet for it.\n\nHmm, okay. First, I need to understand what's going on here. Benny is experiencing high pressure at work, and then he engages in these BDSM activities at home with his wife. So, it seems like he's seeking some kind of release or different dynamic in his personal life after dealing with being in charge at work.\n\nLet me think about option A. It suggests that as a child, he fantasized about being a powerful executive and that this arousal now needs to be discharged when he gets home. But, I'm not sure if that directly explains why he would engage in masochistic activities. Maybe if he had some childhood associations with power and submission, but the option doesn't specify that. It just says he pretended to be powerful and now gets aroused at work, so he needs to discharge it at home. But why does that involve being spanked and tied up? It doesn't seem directly connected.\n\nOption B says he's overcome with self-doubt, and the sadomasochistic behavior is a safe outlet for that. Sadomasochism involves both giving and receiving pain or humiliation, but in this scenario, it's more about Benny receiving it from his wife. So, if he's experiencing self-doubt, maybe being dominated in this way helps him process those feelings of inadequacy. It could be a way for him to feel controlled and thus not have to face his doubts directly.\n\nOption C says he's overwhelmed with pressures and responsibilities at work, and the masochistic behavior allows him to escape from being an autonomous, separate individual. This seems plausible. At work, he's in a position of authority and has a lot of responsibilities, which can be stressful. Maybe by engaging in masochistic activities, he can let go of that control and responsibility temporarily, allowing his wife to take charge. This could provide a sense of relief and escape from the constant pressure of having to make decisions and be in charge.\n\nOption D suggests he's secretly fascinated by violence, and this is a safe way to explore that fascination. While BDSM can involve elements of simulated violence, like spanking and tying up, it's important to note that it's consensual and controlled. However, the scenario doesn't necessarily indicate that Benny has a fascination with violence per se. It might be more about the power dynamics and the release of tension rather than a specific interest in violence.\n\nConsidering all this, option C seems to align best with the scenario described. Benny is under incredible pressure at work, and the masochistic behavior at home allows him to relinquish control and responsibility, providing a temporary escape from the stresses of his professional life.\n\nBut, let me double-check. Maybe there's more to it. For instance, option B also seems relevant because high-pressure jobs can foster self-doubt, and perhaps engaging in these activities helps him process those emotions. However, option C directly links to the escape from responsibility and autonomy, which seems particularly relevant given his position at work.\n\nI think the answer is C. He is overwhelmed with pressures and responsibilities at work, and the masochistic behavior allows him to escape from being an autonomous, separate individual.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
