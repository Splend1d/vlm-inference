I remember that in experimental research, there are different types of designs, and each has its own strengths and limitations. Let's recall what defines a true experimental design first.\n\nA true experimental design involves manipulation of an independent variable and measurement of a dependent variable, with the goal of establishing cause-and-effect relationships. To achieve this, true experiments typically include several important features:\n\n1. Random selection: This involves choosing participants from the population in such a way that each member has an equal chance of being selected. This helps ensure that the sample is representative of the population.\n\n2. Random assignment: This is the process of assigning participants to different groups (e.g., experimental vs. control groups) randomly. It helps ensure that the groups are equivalent at the start of the experiment, minimizing bias.\n\n3. Control group: This is a group that does not receive the experimental treatment. It serves as a baseline to compare against the experimental group.\n\n4. Reliable and valid measures: These are essential for accurately assessing the dependent variable and ensuring that the results are meaningful.\n\nNow, quasi-experimental designs are those that aim to establish cause-and-effect relationships but lack one or more of the features of a true experiment. Specifically, they often lack random assignment to groups. So, participants might not be assigned to experimental and control groups randomly, which can introduce bias and make it harder to attribute changes in the dependent variable solely to the independent variable.\n\nLet's consider each option again in light of this understanding:\n\nA. Random selection of participants from the population\n\nWhile random selection is a desirable feature in true experiments, quasi-experimental designs may or may not include random selection. However, the primary difference between quasi-experimental and true experimental designs is not solely about random selection. It's possible to have a quasi-experimental design with random selection but without random assignment to groups.\n\nFor example, suppose a researcher randomly selects a sample of schools from a district but assigns them to treatment and control groups based on some criteria other than random chance (e.g., existing differences in performance or resource allocation). In this case, even with random selection, the lack of random assignment to groups makes it a quasi-experimental design.\n\nB. Use of control or comparison groups\n\nTrue experimental designs do typically include control groups, but quasi-experimental designs can also include comparison groups. The main difference isn't the presence or absence of a control group, but rather how the groups are formed.\n\nFor instance, in a quasi-experimental design, the comparison group might be selected based on convenience or existing characteristics rather than through random assignment. So, having a control or comparison group is not what distinguishes quasi-experimental from true experimental designs.\n\nC. Random assignment of participants to groups\n\nThis seems to be the crux of the difference. In true experimental designs, participants are randomly assigned to different groups to ensure that the groups are equivalent at the start of the experiment. In quasi-experimental designs, this random assignment is lacking.\n\nWithout random assignment, there may be systematic differences between the groups that could affect the dependent variable, making it difficult to attribute any observed effects solely to the independent variable. For example, in an educational setting, if students are assigned to different teaching methods based on their prior performance, the differences in outcomes might be due to the teaching method or the students' initial abilities.\n\nD. Use of valid and reliable measures of outcome\n\nBoth true experimental and quasi-experimental designs should strive to use valid and reliable measures of the dependent variable. While the quality of measurement is crucial in both types of designs, it's not the feature that distinguishes one from the other.\n\nIn summary, the primary distinction between quasi-experimental and true experimental designs lies in whether there is random assignment of participants to groups. Without random assignment, a design is considered quasi-experimental, and this can introduce potential biases that threaten the internal validity of the study.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. random assignment of participants to groups."
