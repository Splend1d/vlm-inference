                    "text": "So I have this question about potential GDP. It says that potential GDP will fall ceteris paribus if... and then there are four options. I need to pick which one would cause potential GDP to decrease, assuming all else remains the same. Let me think about what potential GDP is first.\n\nPotential GDP is kind of like the maximum sustainable output of an economy. It's what the economy can produce when it's operating at full capacity, but not necessarily at full employment because there's always some natural unemployment. So, it's often linked to the long-run aggregate supply curve in macroeconomics.\n\nNow, potential GDP can be influenced by a few things: primarily the labor force, capital stock, and productivity. So, anything that reduces the labor force, reduces the capital stock, or decreases productivity could lead to a fall in potential GDP.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: The unemployment rate rises.\n\nHmm, this seems tricky. If the unemployment rate rises, it might suggest that fewer people are working, which could mean less production. But potential GDP is supposed to be the output at full employment, or more accurately, at the natural rate of unemployment. So, if unemployment rises above the natural rate, it might indicate that the economy is producing below its potential, but it doesn't necessarily mean that potential GDP itself is falling. Maybe it's more about actual GDP decreasing rather than potential GDP.\n\nWait, but ceteris paribus means all else equal, so perhaps there's no shift in potential GDP just because unemployment fluctuates around the natural rate. Maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nOption B: The retirement age is lowered.\n\nOkay, so if the retirement age is lowered, that means people are expected to retire earlier. That would likely lead to a decrease in the labor force, right? If people stop working earlier, there are fewer people contributing to the economy's production. Since potential GDP depends on the labor force, reducing the labor force by lowering the retirement age could lead to a decrease in potential GDP.\n\nBut, I should consider if there are any offsetting effects. For example, maybe people who retire earlier spend more, increasing demand, but since we're talking about potential GDP, which is about supply capacity, demand-side effects might not directly affect it. Also, if older workers are less productive, maybe replacing them with younger workers could increase productivity, but that might not necessarily be the case for everyone.\n\nOn balance, though, lowering the retirement age seems likely to reduce the labor force, which would decrease potential GDP.\n\nOption C: Tariffs protecting domestic jobs are eliminated.\n\nThis one is interesting. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, and they're meant to protect domestic industries from foreign competition. If tariffs are eliminated, imported goods become cheaper, which could lead to increased competition for domestic producers. This might lead to some domestic industries contracting, possibly resulting in job losses in those sectors.\n\nHowever, elimination of tariffs could also lead to efficiency gains because resources might shift from less efficient domestic production to more efficient foreign production. This could free up resources for other uses, potentially leading to increases in productivity or reallocation to other sectors.\n\nOverall, the effect on potential GDP isn't straightforward. It could go either way depending on the specific industries involved and the economy's ability to adjust. Maybe in the short run, there could be a decrease due to job losses, but in the long run, if the economy adjusts efficiently, potential GDP could increase.\n\nSince the question specifies \"ceteris paribus,\" meaning all else equal, and considering the potential for both positive and negative effects, it's not as clear-cut as some of the other options.\n\nOption D: More immigration is allowed.\n\nImmigration typically increases the labor force. If more immigrants come into the country, and assuming they are of working age and participate in the labor market, this should increase the economy's potential to produce goods and services, thus increasing potential GDP.\n\nBut, again, there could be complexities. For example, if immigrants are mostly low-skilled and the economy already has a surplus of low-skilled workers, this might put downward pressure on wages in those sectors, possibly affecting productivity. However, generally, immigration is considered to increase potential GDP by expanding the labor force.\n\nSo, considering all options:\n\nA. Unemployment rate rises: Probably not directly reducing potential GDP, as it's more about utilization of existing labor.\n\nB. Retirement age is lowered: Likely reduces the labor force, thereby decreasing potential GDP.\n\nC. Tariffs protecting domestic jobs are eliminated: Ambiguous effects on potential GDP.\n\nD. More immigration is allowed: Likely increases the labor force and thus potential GDP.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward answer is Option B: The retirement age is lowered.\n\nI think that's the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
