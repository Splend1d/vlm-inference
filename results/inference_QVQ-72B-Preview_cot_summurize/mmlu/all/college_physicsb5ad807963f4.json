                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about two pendulums, A and B. They both have the same mass, but different string lengths, L_A and L_B. The periods are different: B's period is twice that of A. I need to find the relationship between L_A and L_B based on this information.\n\nFirst, I remember that the period of a simple pendulum is given by the formula:\n\n\\[T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}}\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(T\\) is the period,\n\n- \\(L\\) is the length of the pendulum,\n\n- \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nSince both pendulums are in equal gravitational fields, \\(g\\) is the same for both A and B.\n\nSo, for pendulum A:\n\n\\[T_A = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{L_A}{g}}\\]\n\nAnd for pendulum B:\n\n\\[T_B = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{L_B}{g}}\\]\n\nI'm given that \\(T_B = 2 \\times T_A\\).\n\nSo, plugging in the expressions:\n\n\\[2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{L_B}{g}} = 2 \\times (2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{L_A}{g}})\\]\n\nI can simplify this equation to find the relationship between L_B and L_A.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by \\(2\\pi\\):\n\n\\[\\sqrt{\\frac{L_B}{g}} = 2 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{L_A}{g}}\\]\n\nNotice that the \\(2\\pi\\) and \\(g\\) cancel out on both sides. So, now I have:\n\n\\[\\sqrt{L_B} = 2 \\times \\sqrt{L_A}\\]\n\nNow, to eliminate the square roots, I can square both sides:\n\n\\[(\\sqrt{L_B})^2 = (2 \\times \\sqrt{L_A})^2\\]\n\n\\[L_B = 4 \\times L_A\\]\n\nSo, this means L_B is four times L_A.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. L_B = 4L_A\n\nB. L_B = 2L_A\n\nC. L_B = L_A\n\nD. L_B = 1/2 L_A\n\nSo, option A seems to be correct.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\[T_B = 2 \\times T_A\\]\n\nSubstituting the period formulas:\n\n\\[2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{L_B}{g}} = 2 \\times (2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{L_A}{g}})\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{L_B}{g}} = 4\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{L_A}{g}}\\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\(2\\pi\\):\n\n\\[\\sqrt{\\frac{L_B}{g}} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{L_A}{g}}\\]\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n\\[\\frac{L_B}{g} = 4 \\times \\frac{L_A}{g}\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by g:\n\n\\[L_B = 4 L_A\\]\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the relationship between period and length in a different way. I know that the period of a pendulum is proportional to the square root of its length. So, if period doubles, length must increase by a factor that, when square-rooted, gives 2.\n\nLet\u2019s say:\n\n\\[T \\propto \\sqrt{L}\\]\n\nSo, if \\(T_B = 2 T_A\\), then:\n\n\\[\\sqrt{L_B} = 2 \\times \\sqrt{L_A}\\]\n\nAgain, squaring both sides gives \\(L_B = 4 L_A\\).\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the formula for period directly. Since \\(T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}}\\), and g is constant, the ratio of periods is equal to the square root of the ratio of lengths.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\\frac{T_B}{T_A} = \\sqrt{\\frac{L_B}{L_A}}\\]\n\nGiven that \\(T_B = 2 T_A\\), plug that in:\n\n\\[\\frac{2 T_A}{T_A} = \\sqrt{\\frac{L_B}{L_A}}\\]\n\n\\[2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{L_B}{L_A}}\\]\n\nAgain, square both sides:\n\n\\[4 = \\frac{L_B}{L_A}\\]\n\n\\[L_B = 4 L_A\\]\n\nThis reinforces the same conclusion.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the general relationship between period and length for a simple pendulum. The formula \\(T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}}\\) is derived from the equations of simple harmonic motion, assuming small angles of oscillation. Since the problem states that the pendulums are simple pendulums oscillating in equal gravitational fields, this formula should apply.\n\nAlso, the masses are identical and oscillate in equal gravitational fields, so any differences in period must be due to differences in length.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. L_B = 4L_A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
