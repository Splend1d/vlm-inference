                    "text": "So I have this question here about marketing research firms. It says that a certain type of firm contracts with clients to conduct a complete marketing research project, handling everything from data collection to analysis and reporting. And I need to identify what kind of firm this is from the given options: consultant, field agency, full-service agency, or tabulation agency.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each type of firm does. Let's start with a consultant. I think consultants are experts who provide professional advice and guidance in specific areas. In marketing research, a consultant might advise on research strategies or interpret data, but they don't usually handle the entire research process from start to finish. So, they might not be the ones collecting the data or preparing the reports. Maybe they oversee the project but outsource some parts. Hmm, not sure if that fits the description in the question.\n\nNext, a field agency. I recall that field agencies are primarily responsible for collecting data. They might conduct surveys, interviews, or focus groups on behalf of other research firms or clients. But they don't typically analyze the data or prepare reports. So, if a client wants the whole package\u2014data collection, analysis, and reporting\u2014they probably wouldn't go just to a field agency. Maybe field agencies are more like the foot soldiers of research, gathering information but not processing it further. So, again, doesn't seem to match the description.\n\nNow, a full-service agency sounds promising. The name itself suggests that they offer a comprehensive range of services. So, they likely handle all aspects of a marketing research project, including designing the study, collecting data, analyzing it, and preparing reports. This seems to align perfectly with the description in the question. Clients can contract them to manage the entire research process, which is convenient because they don't have to coordinate multiple vendors for different parts of the project.\n\nLastly, a tabulation agency. From what I can recall, these agencies specialize in data processing and analysis. They take the raw data collected from surveys or other sources and tabulate it, meaning they organize it into tables or summaries for easier understanding. They might also perform basic statistical analyses. However, they don't usually handle data collection or report writing. So, again, not the full package that the question describes.\n\nGiven these understandings, it seems that a full-service agency is the one that offers a complete suite of services, from data collection through analysis and reporting. Therefore, the answer should be C. Full-service agency.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. If I were a client looking to outsource an entire marketing research project without having to manage multiple providers, which type of firm would I choose? Definitely a full-service agency, as they can handle everything under one roof. Consultants might offer strategic advice but might not handle the nitty-gritty of data collection and analysis. Field agencies are great for data collection but don't do the analysis or reporting. Tabulation agencies handle data analysis but don't collect data or write reports.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that a full-service agency is the correct choice here. It's the one that provides a one-stop solution for all the research needs mentioned in the question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Full-service agency}} \\]"
