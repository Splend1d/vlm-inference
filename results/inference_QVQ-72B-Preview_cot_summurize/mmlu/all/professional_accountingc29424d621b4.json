                    "text": "So Mast Co. switched from FIFO to LIFO for inventory valuation, both for financial statements and taxes. We need to figure out how this change affects their ending inventory and income tax payable, especially in a period of inflation. The options are:\n\nA. Lower Lower\n\nB. Higher Higher\n\nC. Lower Higher\n\nD. Higher Lower\n\nFirst, I need to understand what FIFO and LIFO mean.\n\nFIFO stands for First-In, First-Out. It assumes that the oldest inventory items are sold first. So, the cost of goods sold (COGS) is based on the older inventory costs.\n\nLIFO stands for Last-In, First-Out. It assumes that the newest inventory items are sold first. So, the cost of goods sold is based on the most recent inventory costs.\n\nNow, we're in a period of inflation, which means prices are generally increasing over time.\n\nLet's think about how this affects inventory costs.\n\nIf prices are rising (inflation), then newer inventory is more expensive than older inventory.\n\nUnder FIFO, COGS would be based on older, cheaper inventory, so COGS would be lower.\n\nUnder LIFO, COGS would be based on newer, more expensive inventory, so COGS would be higher.\n\nSo, switching from FIFO to LIFO in a period of inflation would lead to higher COGS.\n\nBut wait, higher COGS would mean lower taxable income, right? Because net income is revenue minus expenses, including COGS.\n\nLower taxable income would mean lower income tax payable.\n\nBut let's check the options again.\n\nOption A says lower ending inventory and lower income tax payable.\n\nOption B says higher ending inventory and higher income tax payable.\n\nOption C says lower ending inventory and higher income tax payable.\n\nOption D says higher ending inventory and lower income tax payable.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier reasoning, COGS is higher under LIFO in inflationary periods, which should lead to lower net income and thus lower income tax payable.\n\nSo, income tax payable should be lower under LIFO compared to FIFO.\n\nNow, what about ending inventory?\n\nEnding inventory is valued based on the remaining inventory at the end of the period.\n\nUnder FIFO, the older, cheaper inventory is sold first, so the ending inventory consists of newer, more expensive items.\n\nUnder LIFO, the newer, more expensive inventory is sold first, so the ending inventory consists of older, cheaper items.\n\nTherefore, in a period of inflation, ending inventory under LIFO would be valued at older, cheaper prices, making it lower than under FIFO, where ending inventory is valued at newer, higher prices.\n\nSo, ending inventory would be lower under LIFO compared to FIFO.\n\nAnd income tax payable would be lower under LIFO because higher COGS lead to lower taxable income.\n\nSo, according to this, the correct choice should be A: Lower Lower.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the relationship between COGS and inventory.\n\nIf COGS is higher under LIFO in inflationary times, then inventory on the balance sheet would be lower, as the cost of remaining inventory is based on older, lower prices.\n\nAdditionally, higher COGS lead to lower net income, which in turn leads to lower income tax payable.\n\nSo, both ending inventory and income tax payable would be lower under LIFO compared to FIFO in a period of inflation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Lower Lower.\n\nWait, but is there any scenario where switching to LIFO could lead to higher inventory or higher tax payable?\n\nLet me think about it.\n\nIf prices were decreasing (deflation), then LIFO would result in lower COGS and higher net income, which might lead to higher tax payable.\n\nBut in this case, we're specifically in a period of inflation, so prices are rising.\n\nSo, in this scenario, LIFO should result in higher COGS, lower net income, and thus lower income tax payable.\n\nAlso, ending inventory would be valued at older, lower costs under LIFO, making it lower than FIFO's valuation at newer, higher costs.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A. Lower Lower.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
