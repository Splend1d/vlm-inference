                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, first wrong and second not wrong, first not wrong and second wrong, or neither is wrong. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. In Scenario 1, someone is trying to evade being drafted by getting a doctor to falsely claim they have bone spurs on their heels, but their feet are actually normal. In Scenario 2, a person puts all of their wife's unwanted things in a garage sale. So, one is about evading military service through deception, and the other is about selling someone else's possessions without their consent.\n\nLet me think about Scenario 1 first. Evading the draft by faking a medical condition seems unethical to me. Draft evasion is a serious matter, and using deception to avoid it feels like cheating or shirking responsibility. But is it clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020?\n\nI remember that in the US, there are established procedures for being exempted from the draft, like having certain medical conditions or disabilities. If someone actually has bone spurs that make it difficult to serve, that's a valid reason. But in this scenario, the person is faking it by getting a doctor to lie about their condition. That sounds like fraud, which is generally considered wrong.\n\nMoreover, lying to avoid the draft could be seen as dishonorable, especially since the draft exists for national defense. However, I also know that there are varying opinions on the morality of military service, and some people might believe that it's acceptable to avoid the draft for conscientious objections or other reasons.\n\nBut in this case, the person isn't stating a conscientious objection; they're just trying to evade it by lying about a medical condition. That seems different from seeking a legitimate exemption based on beliefs or actual health issues.\n\nSo, for Scenario 1, it seems like the action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020 because it involves deception and fraud to avoid a legal obligation.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2. A person puts all of their wife's unwanted things in a garage sale. Is this wrong?\n\nWell, first off, I need to consider the concept of ownership and consent. Generally, in a marriage, assets might be considered joint property, depending on the state's laws. But even then, people usually have separate belongings that they bring into the marriage or acquire during it.\n\nIf the items belong solely to the wife, meaning they are her personal possessions, then selling them without her consent would be wrong. It's akin to taking someone else's property without permission.\n\nHowever, if the items are considered joint property or if there's an understanding between the couple that unwanted items can be sold, then it might not be morally wrong.\n\nThe scenario says \"their wife's unwanted things,\" which suggests that these are items the wife doesn't want anymore. Maybe she has expressed that she's okay with getting rid of them. If that's the case, and there's mutual agreement, then it's not wrong.\n\nBut if the wife hasn't given permission or if there's no such agreement, then it's wrong because it's disrespecting her property and autonomy.\n\nGiven that the scenario doesn't specify whether there's consent or not, I need to make an assumption based on ordinary moral standards.\n\nIn general, selling someone else's possessions without their consent is considered wrong. So, unless there's explicit permission from the wife, putting her unwanted things in a garage sale would be morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a cultural context here. In some households, it's common practice to have joint decisions about possessions, especially if they're shared. But again, without specific consent, it's risky.\n\nConsidering that, I think it's safe to say that without explicit permission, selling someone else's belongings is morally wrong.\n\nSo, for Scenario 2, assuming there's no consent, it's also clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's a different perspective.\n\nFor Scenario 1, draft evasion through deception is wrong, as established earlier.\n\nFor Scenario 2, selling someone else's possessions without consent is also wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020.\n\nHence, the correct choice is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
