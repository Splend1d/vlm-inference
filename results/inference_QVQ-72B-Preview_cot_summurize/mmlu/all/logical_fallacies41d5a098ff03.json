                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this logic puzzle here. The question is about a logical fallacy called \"evading burden of proof.\" It says that this is another name for one of the options provided: extension, appeal to ignorance, complex question, or complex proposition. Hmm, I need to recall what \"evading burden of proof\" means and then match it with the correct term from the list.\n\nFirst off, I know that the \"burden of proof\" is the responsibility to provide evidence or justification for a claim. So, if someone makes a claim, it's generally their job to support it with evidence. Evading the burden of proof would mean trying to avoid providing that evidence or shifting the responsibility to someone else to disprove the claim.\n\nLet me look at each option:\n\nA. Extension: I think \"extension\" in logic refers to the extension of a concept, which is the set of things that fall under that concept. For example, the extension of \"dog\" would be all the dogs in the world. But that doesn't seem directly related to evading the burden of proof.\n\nB. Appeal to ignorance: This sounds familiar. I think it's when someone claims that something is true because it hasn't been proven false, or vice versa. Like saying, \"I can't disprove that ghosts exist, therefore they must exist.\" That seems related to evading the burden of proof because instead of providing evidence for the claim, they're shifting the burden to others to disprove it.\n\nC. Complex question: This sounds like a leading question that assumes something that hasn't been proven. For example, \"Have you stopped cheating on tests?\" assumes that you were cheating in the first place. So, it's a way of evading the burden of proving that you were cheating by putting you on the defensive. Hmm, that could also be related.\n\nD. Complex proposition: I'm not as sure about this one. A complex proposition might involve multiple parts or logical connectives, like \"if p then q.\" But I don't see a direct connection to evading the burden of proof.\n\nLet me think again. The question is asking for another name for evading the burden of proof. So, it's likely one of the fallacies that involve shifting the burden of proof incorrectly.\n\nOption B, appeal to ignorance, is definitely about assuming something is true because it hasn't been disproven, which is a way of evading the burden of proof. For example, saying \"I believe in Bigfoot because no one has proven he doesn't exist\" is shifting the burden to others to disprove the existence of Bigfoot, rather than providing evidence for his existence.\n\nOption C, complex question, is a type of fallacy where a question is asked in a way that presupposes something that hasn't been established. It's more about loading the question with an assumption than directly evading the burden of proof. However, it can be related in that it tries to make the other person defend against an assumption rather than proving it.\n\nOption A, extension, seems unrelated to burden of proof. It's more about the scope or application of a concept.\n\nOption D, complex proposition, generally refers to a statement that combines simpler statements using logical operators, which doesn't directly involve burden of proof.\n\nGiven these considerations, option B, appeal to ignorance, seems to be the closest match to evading the burden of proof. It involves shifting the burden to others to disprove a claim rather than providing evidence for it oneself.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there a direct synonym or another name for evading burden of proof?\n\nI recall that \"argument from ignorance\" is a well-known fallacy where someone claims something is true because it hasn't been proven false, or claims something is false because it hasn't been proven true. This directly involves evading the burden of proof by shifting it to the other party.\n\nOn the other hand, a \"complex question\" is a fallacy where a question is asked in a way that assumes something that hasn't been established, which is different from evading the burden of proof.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, I would say that \"appeal to ignorance\" is the correct answer for \"evading burden of proof.\"\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's a more precise term. Is \"appeal to ignorance\" exactly the same as evading burden of proof, or is it just related?\n\nUpon further reflection, I realize that evading the burden of proof can happen in various ways, and appeal to ignorance is one specific way of doing so. So, while appeal to ignorance involves evading the burden of proof by shifting it to the other party to disprove a claim, there might be other ways to evade the burden of proof.\n\nFor example, someone might simply refuse to provide evidence, change the subject, or use a different fallacy like a straw man argument to avoid addressing the claim directly.\n\nHowever, in the context of this question, which asks for another name for evading burden of proof from the given options, appeal to ignorance seems to be the most directly related choice.\n\nComplex question, while related to assumptions and potentially shifting burdens, is not primarily about evading the burden of proof in the same way that appeal to ignorance is.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B. Appeal to ignorance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
