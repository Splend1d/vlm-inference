We then discoursed of the circulation of the blood, the valves in the veins, the venae lactae, the lymphatic vessels, the Copernican hypothesis, the nature of comets and new stars, the satellites of Jupiter, the oval shape (as it then appeared) of Saturn, the spots in the sun, and its turning on its own axis, the inequalities and selenography of the moon, the several phases of Venus and Mercury, the improvement of telescopes, and grinding of glasses for that purpose, the weight of air, the possibility, or impossibility of vacuities, and nature's abhorrence thereof, the Torricellian experiment in quicksilver, the descent of heavy bodies, and the degrees of acceleration therein; and divers other things of like nature. Some of which were then but new discoveries, and others not so generally known and embraced, as now they are. \u2026\nWe barred all discourses of divinity, of state affairs, and of news, other than what concerned our business of Philosophy. These meetings we removed soon after to the Bull Head in Cheapside, and in term-time to Gresham College, where we met weekly at Mr. Foster's lecture (then Astronomy Professor there), and, after the lecture ended, repaired, sometimes to Mr. Foster's lodgings, sometimes to some other place not far distant, where we continued such enquiries, and our numbers increased.\nDr. John Wallis, Account of Some Passages of his Life, 1700\nThe passage may be used as evidence for the development of\n\nA. an independent society for the study of natural philosophy in the seventeenth century\nB. the study of natural philosophy in the royal courts in the seventeenth century\nC. new universities for the study of natural philosophy in the seventeenth century\nD. the study of natural philosophy in the Church in the seventeenth century\n"

The event it describes takes place around 1645 in London. Wallis mentions being acquainted with several people who were into natural philosophy and experimental philosophy. They started meeting weekly to discuss various topics related to science and philosophy, excluding theology and state affairs.\n\nThey talked about things like the circulation of blood, the structure of veins, the lymphatic system, the Copernican theory, comets, new stars, Jupiter's satellites, Saturn's rings, sunspots, the moon's features, Venus and Mercury's phases, telescopes, air pressure, vacuums, and the speed of falling objects. A lot of these were new discoveries at the time or ideas that were not yet widely accepted.\n\nAs time went on, they moved their meetings to different locations, including Gresham College, and their numbers grew. They would meet after lectures and continue their discussions in various places.\n\nNow, the question is asking which option this passage can be used as evidence for, regarding the development of natural philosophy in the seventeenth century.\n\nOption A says it's evidence for an independent society for the study of natural philosophy.\n\nOption B suggests it's about the study of natural philosophy in royal courts.\n\nOption C mentions new universities for natural philosophy.\n\nOption D refers to the study of natural philosophy in the Church.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nFirst, the passage describes a group of people coming together independently to discuss natural philosophy. They set their own rules, like excluding theology and state affairs, and chose their topics based on their interests in new scientific discoveries and philosophical inquiries.\n\nThey didn't seem to be officially affiliated with any royal court, university, or church institution, at least not directly from what's mentioned. They met in public places like inns and colleges, but it doesn't indicate that these were official institutions or that their discussions were part of any formal academic or courtly program.\n\nSo, option A seems plausible because they were an independent group forming to study and discuss natural philosophy.\n\nOption B, studying natural philosophy in royal courts, doesn't seem to align because there's no mention of a court setting or royal patronage.\n\nOption C suggests new universities, but again, there's no indication that they were forming a new university. They were just meeting regularly to discuss topics of mutual interest.\n\nOption D mentions the Church, but they specifically excluded theology from their discussions, which suggests they weren't part of Church studies and might have been moving away from traditional church doctrines in their inquiries.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate use of this passage would be as evidence for the development of an independent society for the study of natural philosophy in the seventeenth century.\n\nI think the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
