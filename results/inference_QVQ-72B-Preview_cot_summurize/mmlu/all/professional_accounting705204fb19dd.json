                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about financial statements for a voluntary health and welfare nongovernmental not-for-profit organization. It's asking whether these organizations must report expenses by functional and natural classifications. The options are \"Yes\" or \"No\" for each, and they're combined into choices A through D.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"functional\" and \"natural\" classifications mean in the context of expense reporting for not-for-profit organizations.\n\nI recall that in not-for-profit accounting, expenses can be classified in different ways to provide more transparency about how the organization is using its resources.\n\nStarting with functional classification, I think this refers to categorizing expenses based on the function or purpose they serve. For example, expenses might be grouped into program services, management and general administration, and fundraising. This helps stakeholders understand how much is being spent directly on the organization's programs versus supporting activities.\n\nOn the other hand, natural classification seems to involve categorizing expenses based on their nature or type. This could include categories like salaries, rent, supplies, utilities, and depreciation. This type of classification gives insight into the actual resources consumed by the organization.\n\nNow, the question is specifically about voluntary health and welfare nongovernmental not-for-profit organizations. I need to recall if there are specific requirements for these types of organizations to report expenses using these classifications.\n\nI remember that generally, not-for-profit organizations are required to present their expenses by functional classification in their statement of activities. This is in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) standards for not-for-profit entities.\n\nHowever, for natural classification, I think it's more common to present this information in additional schedules or notes to the financial statements, rather than in the primary financial statements themselves.\n\nBut, I should check if there are any specific requirements for voluntary health and welfare organizations, as they might have additional reporting obligations.\n\nI also recall that nongovernmental not-for-profit organizations might have different requirements compared to governmental entities, so it's important to distinguish between the two.\n\nLet me consider the standard format for the statement of activities in not-for-profit organizations. Typically, it shows revenues, expenses, and changes in net assets. Expenses are often presented by their functional categories, such as program services, management and general, and fundraising.\n\nAs for natural classification, while it's important for internal management and may be included in supplementary information, it's not usually part of the primary financial statements.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether there's a trend or requirement for including natural classification in the primary financial statements for health and welfare organizations.\n\nPerhaps I should look at some examples or specific guidelines for these types of organizations.\n\nWait a minute, I think there might be a confusion here. The question mentions \"financial statements prepared by a voluntary health and welfare nongovernmental not-for-profit organization must report expenses by the following classification(s): Functional Natural\"\n\nAnd the options are combinations of \"Yes\" and \"No\" for Functional and Natural.\n\nGiven that, I need to determine whether both classifications are required, only one of them, or neither.\n\nFrom my knowledge, functional classification is indeed required for not-for-profit organizations in their primary financial statements. So, for functional classification, the answer should be \"Yes.\"\n\nAs for natural classification, while it's important and often used in internal reporting and may be included in notes to the financial statements, it's not typically part of the primary financial statements. Therefore, for natural classification, the answer should be \"No.\"\n\nSo, matching this to the options provided:\n\nA. Yes Yes\n\nB. Yes No\n\nC. No Yes\n\nD. No No\n\nI think the correct choice is B. Yes No\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nFunctional classification is a standard requirement for not-for-profit organizations, as it helps in understanding how resources are being used to achieve the organization's mission.\n\nNatural classification, while important, is more of a detail that might be provided in supplementary schedules or notes, but not in the primary financial statements themselves.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Yes No\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
