                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: (i + 1)(5 \u2013 5i)(5 + 5i). I need to simplify this expression. I'm a bit rusty on complex numbers, but I remember that i is the imaginary unit, where i squared equals -1. Okay, let's take this step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that there are three terms being multiplied together: (i + 1), (5 \u2013 5i), and (5 + 5i). Maybe I can simplify this by multiplying two of them first and then multiplying the result by the third term.\n\nLet me start by multiplying (5 \u2013 5i) and (5 + 5i). I recall that when you multiply a complex number by its conjugate, you get the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts. The conjugate of (5 \u2013 5i) is (5 + 5i). So, (5 \u2013 5i)(5 + 5i) should be 5*5 + (5i)*5i, but wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nActually, the product of a complex number and its conjugate is equal to the square of the modulus of the complex number. The modulus of (5 \u2013 5i) is the square root of (5)^2 + (-5)^2, which is sqrt(25 + 25) = sqrt(50) = 5\u221a2. So, the product should be (5\u221a2)^2, which is 25*2 = 50.\n\nAlternatively, I could have just multiplied (5 \u2013 5i)(5 + 5i) directly using the foil method:\n\n(5 \u2013 5i)(5 + 5i) = 5*5 + 5*5i \u2013 5i*5 \u2013 5i*5i = 25 + 25i \u2013 25i \u2013 25i^2.\n\nSince i^2 = -1, this becomes 25 + 25i \u2013 25i \u2013 25*(-1) = 25 + 0 \u2013 (-25) = 25 + 25 = 50.\n\nOkay, so (5 \u2013 5i)(5 + 5i) = 50.\n\nNow, the expression simplifies to (i + 1)*50.\n\nNow, I just need to multiply (i + 1) by 50.\n\nDistributing 50 to each term in the parenthesis: 50*i + 50*1 = 50i + 50.\n\nSo, the simplified form is 50 + 50i.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 50 + 50i\n\nB. 50 \u2013 50i\n\nC. 25 + 25i\n\nD. 25 \u2013 25i\n\nIt seems like the answer should be A. 50 + 50i.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there's another way to approach this or if I've made a mistake somewhere.\n\nAnother approach could be to multiply (i + 1) and (5 \u2013 5i) first, and then multiply the result by (5 + 5i).\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, multiply (i + 1)(5 \u2013 5i):\n\nUsing the distributive property: i*5 + i*(-5i) + 1*5 + 1*(-5i) = 5i \u2013 5i^2 + 5 \u2013 5i.\n\nSince i^2 = -1, this becomes: 5i \u2013 5*(-1) + 5 \u2013 5i = 5i + 5 + 5 \u2013 5i = (5i \u2013 5i) + (5 + 5) = 0 + 10 = 10.\n\nSo, (i + 1)(5 \u2013 5i) = 10.\n\nNow, multiply this result by (5 + 5i): 10*(5 + 5i) = 50 + 50i.\n\nAgain, the same result, 50 + 50i.\n\nAlternatively, I could multiply (i + 1) and (5 + 5i) first.\n\nLet's see:\n\n(i + 1)(5 + 5i) = i*5 + i*5i + 1*5 + 1*5i = 5i + 5i^2 + 5 + 5i = 5i + 5*(-1) + 5 + 5i = 5i \u2013 5 + 5 + 5i = (5i + 5i) + (-5 + 5) = 10i + 0 = 10i.\n\nThen, multiply this by (5 \u2013 5i): 10i*(5 \u2013 5i) = 50i \u2013 50i^2 = 50i \u2013 50*(-1) = 50i + 50 = 50 + 50i.\n\nSame result again.\n\nIt looks consistent across different methods, so I'm confident that the correct answer is 50 + 50i, which corresponds to option A.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other property or simplification that I might have missed.\n\nIs there a way to simplify (i + 1)(5 \u2013 5i)(5 + 5i) differently, perhaps by factoring or recognizing some patterns?\n\nWell, I already used the conjugate approach and direct multiplication, and both gave the same result. So, I think I've covered the main ways to approach this problem.\n\nI don't see any algebraic mistakes in the steps I've taken, so I'm going to go with option A: 50 + 50i.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 50 + 50i} \\]"
