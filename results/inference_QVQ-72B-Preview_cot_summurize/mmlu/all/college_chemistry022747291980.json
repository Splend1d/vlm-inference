                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about identifying which isomer of C6H14 has a 13C NMR spectrum with five distinct chemical shifts. The options are hexane, 2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane, and 2,3-dimethylbutane. I need to figure out which one of these has five different carbon signals in its 13C NMR spectrum.\n\nFirst off, I know that in NMR spectroscopy, each unique environment for carbon atoms corresponds to a distinct signal. So, if a molecule has carbon atoms in different chemical environments, they'll show up as separate peaks in the spectrum. The number of these unique environments will determine the number of signals in the spectrum.\n\nSince all these molecules have the formula C6H14, they're all alkanes, and their structures are relatively simple. I need to visualize or draw out each isomer to see how many unique carbon positions each has.\n\nLet's start with hexane, which is the straight-chain alkane with six carbon atoms. Its structure is:\n\nCH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3\n\nIn this structure, the carbon atoms can be categorized based on their positions:\n\n- The two terminal carbons (methyl groups): these are equivalent due to symmetry.\n\n- The two carbons in the middle: again, equivalent to each other.\n\n- The two carbons adjacent to the middle: also equivalent to each other.\n\nSo, in hexane, there are three unique carbon environments: the terminal methyls, the central methylenes, and the methylenes next to the central ones. Therefore, its 13C NMR spectrum should show three distinct signals, not five. So, option A is out.\n\nNext, let's look at 2-methylpentane. The name suggests it's a pentane with a methyl group on the second carbon. So, its structure should be:\n\nCH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3\n\nLet's draw this out to see the carbon positions:\n\n1. CH3 (terminal)\n\n2. CH (attached to a methyl)\n\n3. CH2 (between the CH and CH2)\n\n4. CH2 (next to the previous CH2)\n\n5. CH3 (terminal)\n\nWait, that seems like five different carbon environments. Let's double-check:\n\n- Carbon 1: terminal methyl\n\n- Carbon 2: tertiary carbon attached to a methyl group\n\n- Carbon 3: methylene group between carbon 2 and carbon 4\n\n- Carbon 4: methylene group adjacent to carbon 3 and connected to the terminal methyl\n\n- Carbon 5: terminal methyl\n\nAre all these positions unique?\n\n- Carbon 1 and Carbon 5 are both terminal methyls, but are they equivalent?\n\nIn this structure, the molecule is symmetric in a way that Carbon 1 and Carbon 5 might be equivalent, but actually, due to the asymmetry introduced by the methyl group on Carbon 2, they might not be.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to draw a more detailed structure to see.\n\nLet's try redrawing:\n\n- Carbon 1: CH3\n\n- Carbon 2: CH (attached to Carbon 1 and a CH3)\n\n- Carbon 3: CH2 (attached to Carbon 2 and Carbon 4)\n\n- Carbon 4: CH2 (attached to Carbon 3 and Carbon 5)\n\n- Carbon 5: CH3\n\nLooking at this, Carbon 1 and Carbon 5 are both methyl groups, but their connections are different based on their positions. Carbon 1 is connected to Carbon 2, while Carbon 5 is connected to Carbon 4. Given the asymmetry, these two methyl groups might not be equivalent.\n\nSimilarly, Carbon 3 and Carbon 4 are both methylene groups, but Carbon 3 is connected to Carbon 2 and Carbon 4, while Carbon 4 is connected to Carbon 3 and Carbon 5. Given the overall structure, these might also be non-equivalent.\n\nTherefore, it seems like all five carbon atoms in 2-methylpentane are in unique environments, which would mean five distinct signals in the 13C NMR spectrum. But wait, that seems counterintuitive because usually, symmetric molecules have fewer unique environments.\n\nLet me check a reference or see if I can recall any standard NMR data for 2-methylpentane.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the symmetry more carefully.\n\nIn 2-methylpentane, the molecule has a methyl group on the second carbon, breaking the symmetry of the chain. So, Carbon 2 is different from the others, and the carbons on either side of it are not identical.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the molecule's mirror image. If there's a plane of symmetry, some positions might be equivalent.\n\nDrawing the structure again:\n\nCH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3\n\nIf I imagine a mirror plane, it would be in the middle, between Carbon 3 and Carbon 4. So, Carbon 1 and Carbon 5 would be mirror images of each other and thus equivalent, same for Carbon 3 and Carbon 4.\n\nTherefore, there are three unique carbon environments:\n\n- The methyl group on Carbon 2\n\n- The terminal methyls (Carbon 1 and Carbon 5)\n\n- The methylene groups (Carbon 3 and Carbon 4)\n\nWait, that would mean only three unique signals, which contradicts my earlier thought of five.\n\nI must have made a mistake earlier. Let's re-examine.\n\nIf Carbon 2 is asymmetric, with one methyl and one methylene connected to it, and Carbon 3 and Carbon 4 are both methylenes, and Carbon 1 and Carbon 5 are both methyls, then:\n\n- Carbon 2 is unique due to its attachment to the methyl group.\n\n- Carbon 1 and Carbon 5 are equivalent terminal methyls.\n\n- Carbon 3 and Carbon 4 are equivalent methylenes connected to Carbon 2 and each other.\n\nTherefore, there are three unique carbon environments, similar to hexane, not five.\n\nSo, perhaps option B is incorrect, or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the possibility of diastereotopic carbons, but in alkanes, that's less likely for carbon atoms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of signals corresponds to the number of different carbon environments, considering their connectivity.\n\nLet me try option C, 3-methylpentane.\n\nStructure of 3-methylpentane:\n\nCH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3\n\nDrawing this out:\n\n1. CH3\n\n2. CH2\n\n3. CH (attached to a methyl)\n\n4. CH2\n\n5. CH3\n\nNow, let's see:\n\n- Carbon 1: terminal methyl\n\n- Carbon 2: methylene next to the tertiary carbon\n\n- Carbon 3: tertiary carbon attached to a methyl group\n\n- Carbon 4: methylene next to the tertiary carbon, similar to Carbon 2\n\n- Carbon 5: terminal methyl\n\nAre Carbon 2 and Carbon 4 equivalent? In this structure, yes, they are both methylenes connected to Carbon 3 and their respective terminal methyls.\n\nSimilarly, Carbon 1 and Carbon 5 are both terminal methyls and should be equivalent.\n\nCarbon 3 is unique due to its attachment to the methyl group.\n\nTherefore, there are three unique carbon environments: the terminal methyls, the methylene groups (Carbon 2 and Carbon 4), and the tertiary carbon (Carbon 3).\n\nSo, three signals again, not five.\n\nThis is confusing because I thought initially that 2-methylpentane might have five unique carbon environments, but now it seems both 2-methylpentane and 3-methylpentane have only three.\n\nMaybe I need to look at 2,3-dimethylbutane.\n\nStructure of 2,3-dimethylbutane:\n\nCH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH3\n\nDrawing this out:\n\n1. CH3\n\n2. CH (attached to a methyl)\n\n3. CH (attached to a methyl)\n\n4. CH3\n\nNow, let's identify the uniqueness of each carbon:\n\n- Carbon 1: terminal methyl\n\n- Carbon 2: secondary carbon attached to a methyl\n\n- Carbon 3: secondary carbon attached to a methyl\n\n- Carbon 4: terminal methyl\n\nGiven the symmetry of the molecule, Carbon 2 and Carbon 3 are both secondary carbons and are equivalent, while Carbon 1 and Carbon 4 are terminal methyls and are equivalent to each other.\n\nTherefore, there are two unique carbon environments: the secondary carbons and the terminal methyls.\n\nSo, only two signals in the 13C NMR spectrum.\n\nThis is getting interesting. So far, hexane has three, 2-methylpentane has three, 3-methylpentane has three, and 2,3-dimethylbutane has two. None of these have five distinct signals.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in counting for 2-methylpentane. Let me double-check that.\n\nIn 2-methylpentane:\n\nCH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3\n\n- Carbon 1: terminal methyl\n\n- Carbon 2: secondary carbon attached to a methyl\n\n- Carbon 3: methylene\n\n- Carbon 4: methylene\n\n- Carbon 5: terminal methyl\n\nGiven the symmetry, Carbon 1 and Carbon 5 are equivalent, Carbon 2 is unique, and Carbon 3 and Carbon 4 are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, three unique carbon environments, as previously concluded.\n\nSimilarly, in 3-methylpentane:\n\nCH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3\n\n- Carbon 1: terminal methyl\n\n- Carbon 2: methylene\n\n- Carbon 3: secondary carbon attached to a methyl\n\n- Carbon 4: methylene\n\n- Carbon 5: terminal methyl\n\nAgain, Carbon 1 and Carbon 5 are equivalent, Carbon 2 and Carbon 4 are equivalent, and Carbon 3 is unique.\n\nSo, three unique carbon environments.\n\n2,3-dimethylbutane:\n\nCH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH3\n\n- Carbon 1: terminal methyl\n\n- Carbon 2: secondary carbon attached to a methyl\n\n- Carbon 3: secondary carbon attached to a methyl\n\n- Carbon 4: terminal methyl\n\nHere, Carbon 1 and Carbon 4 are equivalent, and Carbon 2 and Carbon 3 are equivalent.\n\nThus, two unique carbon environments.\n\nHexane:\n\nCH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3\n\n- Carbon 1: terminal methyl\n\n- Carbon 2: methylene\n\n- Carbon 3: methylene\n\n- Carbon 4: methylene\n\n- Carbon 5: methylene\n\n- Carbon 6: terminal methyl\n\nHere, Carbon 1 and Carbon 6 are equivalent, Carbon 2 and Carbon 5 are equivalent, and Carbon 3 and Carbon 4 are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, three unique carbon environments.\n\nSo, none of these isomers have five distinct carbon signals. But the problem states that one of them does. Maybe I'm missing something about the symmetry or the uniqueness of the carbon positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another isomer of C6H14 that I haven't considered, but the options provided are hexane, 2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane, and 2,3-dimethylbutane, which are all the possible isomers of C6H14.\n\nWait, is there a possibility of 2,2-dimethylbutane?\n\nNo, 2,2-dimethylbutane is another isomer:\n\nCH3-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH3\n\nStructure:\n\n- Carbon 1: methyl\n\n- Carbon 2: quaternary carbon attached to three methyls\n\n- Carbon 3: methylene\n\n- Carbon 4: methyl\n\nHere, Carbon 1 and Carbon 4 are equivalent methyls, Carbon 2 is a quaternary carbon, and Carbon 3 is a methylene.\n\nSo, three unique carbon environments.\n\nStill not five.\n\nThis is puzzling. All the isomers I've considered have fewer than five unique carbon environments.\n\nMaybe the problem has a typo, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing whether I can recognize that none of the given options have five distinct carbon signals.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as the problem seems to suggest that one of them does have five distinct signals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that some carbons are chiral and thus have different environments.\n\nBut in alkanes, chirality doesn't affect carbon NMR signals in this way.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the number of different carbon types based on their connections.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to recall the actual NMR spectra for these compounds.\n\nLet me try to look up the 13C NMR data for these compounds.\n\nStarting with hexane:\n\nHexane has three distinct carbon signals: one for the terminal methyls, one for the central methylenes, and one for the methylenes next to the central ones.\n\nSimilarly, 2-methylpentane and 3-methylpentane both have three distinct carbon signals, as per my earlier analysis.\n\n2,3-dimethylbutane has two distinct carbon signals.\n\nTherefore, none of these have five distinct carbon signals.\n\nBut the problem states that one of them does, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the number of peaks in the proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectrum, where each unique carbon environment gives a distinct peak.\n\nGiven that, and my earlier analysis, none of the options seem to have five distinct carbon environments.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, and it should refer to a different compound or a different number of signals.\n\nBut assuming the problem is correct, and one of these isomers does have five distinct carbon signals, perhaps I need to reconsider my approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is testing whether I can recognize that 2-methylpentane has five distinct carbon signals due to a lack of symmetry.\n\nBut based on my analysis, 2-methylpentane should have three distinct carbon environments.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the specific positions more carefully.\n\nIn 2-methylpentane:\n\nCH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3\n\nLet's number the carbons:\n\n1. CH3\n\n2. CH (attached to CH3)\n\n3. CH2\n\n4. CH2\n\n5. CH3\n\nNow, considering their connectivity:\n\n- Carbon 1 is bonded to Carbon 2 and is a methyl group.\n\n- Carbon 2 is bonded to Carbon 1, Carbon 3, and a methyl group.\n\n- Carbon 3 is bonded to Carbon 2 and Carbon 4.\n\n- Carbon 4 is bonded to Carbon 3 and Carbon 5.\n\n- Carbon 5 is bonded to Carbon 4 and is a methyl group.\n\nGiven this, Carbon 1 and Carbon 5 are both terminal methyls, but their connections are different: Carbon 1 is connected to Carbon 2, which is a secondary carbon, while Carbon 5 is connected to Carbon 4, which is a primary carbon.\n\nWait, no, Carbon 4 is connected to Carbon 3, which is a methylene, and Carbon 5 is a methyl.\n\nSo, Carbon 4 is a primary carbon (methylene) connected to Carbon 3 and Carbon 5.\n\nCarbon 2 is a secondary carbon connected to Carbon 1, Carbon 3, and a methyl.\n\nCarbon 1 is a methyl connected to Carbon 2.\n\nCarbon 5 is a methyl connected to Carbon 4.\n\nCarbon 3 is a methylene connected to Carbon 2 and Carbon 4.\n\nGiven this, are Carbon 1 and Carbon 5 equivalent?\n\nIn terms of their environment, both are methyl groups, but Carbon 1 is connected to a secondary carbon (Carbon 2), while Carbon 5 is connected to a primary carbon (Carbon 4).\n\nThis difference might make them non-equivalent in their electronic environment, leading to different chemical shifts.\n\nSimilarly, Carbon 3 and Carbon 4 are both methylenes, but Carbon 3 is connected to Carbon 2 (a secondary carbon) and Carbon 4 (a primary carbon), while Carbon 4 is connected to Carbon 3 (a methylene) and Carbon 5 (a methyl).\n\nThis suggests that Carbon 3 and Carbon 4 might not be equivalent due to their different connections.\n\nTherefore, perhaps all five carbons in 2-methylpentane are in unique environments, leading to five distinct signals in the 13C NMR spectrum.\n\nLet me see if that's the case.\n\nLooking back, Carbon 1: methyl connected to a secondary carbon.\n\nCarbon 2: secondary carbon connected to a methyl, a methyl, and a methylene.\n\nCarbon 3: methylene connected to a secondary carbon and a primary carbon.\n\nCarbon 4: primary carbon connected to a methylene and a methyl.\n\nCarbon 5: methyl connected to a primary carbon.\n\nSo, each carbon has a unique connectivity pattern, which could result in unique chemical shifts.\n\nTherefore, 2-methylpentane might indeed have five distinct carbon signals.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that Carbon 1 and Carbon 5 are equivalent because they are both terminal methyls, but perhaps their environments are different enough to make them distinct in the NMR spectrum.\n\nSimilarly, Carbon 3 and Carbon 4, being methylenes but connected differently, might not be equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer might be B. 2-methylpentane.\n\nBut according to my initial analysis, I thought it had only three unique carbon environments.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it seems that all five carbons are in unique environments, leading to five distinct signals.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 2-methylpentane.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
