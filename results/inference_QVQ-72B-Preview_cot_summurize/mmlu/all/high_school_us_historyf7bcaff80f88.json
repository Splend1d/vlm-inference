We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.\n\"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated.

                    "text": "So I've got this question about the \"free silver\" campaign of 1896 and where it received its greatest popular support. The options are:\n\nA. New England businessmen, who were discriminated against under the existing banking system\n\nB. Southern women, who incorporated it into a larger campaign for economic equality\n\nC. bankers, who had run out of paper currency to invest\n\nD. farmers, who hoped that a more generous money supply would ease their debt burdens\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First off, I need to recall what the \"free silver\" campaign was all about. I remember that in the late 19th century, there was a big debate about whether the United States should adopt a bimetallic standard, meaning using both gold and silver as the basis for its currency, or stick with just gold.\n\nThe Populist Party, which was pretty influential at the time, especially among farmers, advocated for \"free silver.\" That meant unrestricted coinage of silver, which would increase the money supply because there was a lot more silver available than gold. They believed that increasing the money supply would help debtors, particularly farmers who were burdened with loans.\n\nSo, option D seems to align with that. Farmers hoped that more money in circulation would lead to inflation, which would make their debts easier to pay off since the money would be worth less.\n\nBut let's consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: New England businessmen who were discriminated against under the existing banking system. Hmm, New England was a hub of industry and finance, and while there might have been some businessmen who supported free silver, I think the financial interests in New England were mostly pro-gold. The gold standard was seen as more stable for international trade and finance. So, it seems unlikely that New England businessmen were the main supporters of free silver.\n\nOption B: Southern women who incorporated it into a larger campaign for economic equality. This is interesting. I know that the Populist movement had elements of social reform, and women were involved in various reform movements at the time. However, I'm not sure if southern women were specifically leading the charge for free silver. Maybe some were supporters, but I don't recall it being a central part of their agenda.\n\nOption C: bankers, who had run out of paper currency to invest. Bankers, especially those in Wall Street and other financial centers, were generally opposed to free silver. They favored the gold standard for its stability and because it was the standard used in international finance. The idea that bankers had run out of paper currency to invest doesn't ring true; banks issued notes based on their gold reserves, and there was a limit to how much they could issue. Free silver would have upset that system, potentially leading to inflation, which bankers might not have favored.\n\nSo, after considering all this, it seems that option D is the most accurate. Farmers, particularly in the West and South, were facing hard times due to low crop prices and high debt burdens. They believed that increasing the money supply by coining more silver would lead to higher prices for their crops and make their debts easier to repay.\n\nPlus, the Populist Party, which strongly advocated for free silver, drew much of its support from rural areas and farmers' alliances. So, that lines up with option D.\n\nI should also consider the Populist Party Platform from 1892, which is mentioned in the question. It talks about the struggles of the people against political parties dominated by wealthy interests and expresses a desire to restore government to the hands of \"the plain people.\" This further reinforces the idea that the Populists were representing the interests of ordinary farmers against the financial elite.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the \"free silver\" campaign of 1896 received its greatest popular support from farmers who hoped that a more generous money supply would ease their debt burdens. That would be option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
