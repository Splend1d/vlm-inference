                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this genetics problem, and I need to figure out which genetic phenomenon explains the results. The options are epistasis, incomplete dominance, codominance, and inbreeding depression. Okay, let's recall what each of these terms means.\n\nFirst, epistasis is when one gene affects the expression of another gene. So, like, one gene masks the effect of another. But in this problem, we have two lines of plants crossing, and the F1 is a intermediate phenotype, and then the F2 shows a 1:2:1 ratio. That doesn't sound like epistasis, does it? Epistasis usually involves multiple genes interacting, but here it seems like we're dealing with a single gene with different alleles.\n\nNext, incomplete dominance. I remember that in incomplete dominance, neither allele is dominant over the other, so the heterozygote has a phenotype that's kind of in between the two homozygotes. Like the color is intermediate. In this case, dark blue and white cross, and the F1 is light blue. That sounds like an intermediate phenotype, which suggests incomplete dominance.\n\nCodominance is different. In codominance, both alleles are expressed simultaneously in the heterozygote. So, for example, if you have red and white flowers, and the heterozygote has red and white sectors or something, like variegation. But here, the F1 is light blue, which is a blend, not a mixture of dark blue and white.\n\nInbreeding depression refers to the reduced fitness in a population due to inbreeding, like when closely related individuals mate. But in this problem, we're just crossing two true-breeding lines, so I don't think inbreeding depression is the main phenomenon at play here.\n\nSo, between incomplete dominance and codominance, incomplete dominance seems more fitting because the F1 phenotype is intermediate, not a mixture of both phenotypes.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. If it's incomplete dominance, then the genotypes would be something like AA (dark blue), Aa (light blue), and aa (white). So, the F1 would be Aa, which is light blue, and the F2 would be 1 AA (dark blue), 2 Aa (light blue), and 1 aa (white), which matches the 1:2:1 ratio observed.\n\nIn codominance, if we had two alleles, say C and W for dark blue and white, then CC would be dark blue, WW would be white, and CW would show both traits, maybe as sectored flowers or something. But in this problem, the F1 is uniformly light blue, not showing any sectio\u200bning, so codominance doesn't seem to fit.\n\nEpistasis would involve at least two genes interacting. For example, one gene could control flower color production, and another gene could affect the expression of the first gene. But the problem mentions only two true-breeding lines crossed, suggesting a single gene difference.\n\nInbreeding depression is more about the consequences of inbreeding, like reduced vigor or fertility, which isn't directly addressed in this problem.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate explanation for the observed results is incomplete dominance.\n\nWait a minute, let's consider if there could be another explanation. Maybe if there's a modifier gene or something, but the problem seems straightforward, focusing on a single gene with two alleles.\n\nAnother thought: could this be an example of partial dominance rather than incomplete dominance? I think partial dominance is sometimes used interchangeably with incomplete dominance, but I should check.\n\nUpon checking, incomplete dominance and partial dominance are sometimes used interchangeably, but technically, incomplete dominance refers to the heterozygote having a phenotype that is truly intermediate between the two homozygotes, while partial dominance might imply that one allele is somewhat dominant over the other, but not completely.\n\nIn this case, since the F1 is light blue, which is clearly intermediate between dark blue and white, incomplete dominance seems to be the better term.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. incomplete dominance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
