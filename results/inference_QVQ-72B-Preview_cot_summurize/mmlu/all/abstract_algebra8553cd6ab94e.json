                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"Find the characteristic of the ring Z_3 x Z_3.\" And the options are A. 0, B. 3, C. 12, D. 30. Hmm, I need to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on rings and their characteristics, but let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what the characteristic of a ring is. I think it's the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n \\cdot a = 0 \\) for every element \\( a \\) in the ring, where \\( n \\cdot a \\) means adding \\( a \\) to itself \\( n \\) times. If no such \\( n \\) exists, then the characteristic is 0. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the ring in question is \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\). I know that \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) is the integers modulo 3, which is a field because 3 is prime. So, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) consists of ordered pairs where each component is from \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\). That means elements look like \\( (0,0) \\), \\( (1,0) \\), \\( (0,1) \\), \\( (1,1) \\), \\( (2,0) \\), \\( (0,2) \\), \\( (2,1) \\), \\( (1,2) \\), and \\( (2,2) \\).\n\nI need to find the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n \\cdot a = 0 \\) for every element \\( a \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\).\n\nLet me pick an element, say \\( (1,1) \\), and see what happens. So, \\( 1 \\cdot (1,1) = (1,1) \\), \\( 2 \\cdot (1,1) = (2,2) \\), and \\( 3 \\cdot (1,1) = (0,0) \\). Oh, interesting. So, multiplying by 3 gives the zero element.\n\nLet me try another element, say \\( (2,0) \\). So, \\( 1 \\cdot (2,0) = (2,0) \\), \\( 2 \\cdot (2,0) = (1,0) \\), and \\( 3 \\cdot (2,0) = (0,0) \\). Again, multiplying by 3 gives zero.\n\nHmm, maybe this is always the case for any element in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\). Let's consider a general element \\( (a,b) \\), where \\( a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\). Then, \\( n \\cdot (a,b) = (n \\cdot a, n \\cdot b) \\). Since \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) has characteristic 3, \\( 3 \\cdot a = 0 \\) and \\( 3 \\cdot b = 0 \\), so \\( 3 \\cdot (a,b) = (0,0) \\).\n\nWait, but is there a smaller \\( n \\) that works for all elements? Let's check \\( n = 1 \\): \\( 1 \\cdot (1,1) = (1,1) \\neq (0,0) \\), so no. \\( n = 2 \\): \\( 2 \\cdot (1,1) = (2,2) \\neq (0,0) \\), so no. \\( n = 3 \\): as we saw, it gives zero. So, for this ring, the characteristic seems to be 3.\n\nBut let's make sure there isn't a smaller \\( n \\) that works for all elements. Suppose there exists an \\( n < 3 \\) such that \\( n \\cdot a = 0 \\) for all \\( a \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\). But from the earlier examples, \\( n = 1 \\) and \\( n = 2 \\) don't work for all elements. So, no, there is no smaller positive integer \\( n \\) that satisfies the condition.\n\nTherefore, the characteristic of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) is 3.\n\nWait a minute, is there a general formula for the characteristic of a direct product of rings? I think that if you have two rings \\( R \\) and \\( S \\), then the characteristic of \\( R \\times S \\) is the least common multiple of the characteristics of \\( R \\) and \\( S \\). But in this case, both \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) have characteristic 3, so LCM(3,3) is still 3, which confirms my previous conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the additive order of the ring. The additive group of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), which is a group of order 9. The characteristic should be the order of the additive group, which is 9. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 3. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nLet me double-check. The characteristic of a finite ring is the same as the characteristic of its additive group, which is the order of the additive group divided by the exponent of the additive group. Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing things.\n\nActually, for a finite ring, the characteristic is the order of its additive group if and only if the ring is the direct product of fields of the same characteristic. Wait, is that right?\n\nLet me recall that the characteristic of a finite ring is the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n \\cdot a = 0 \\) for all \\( a \\) in the ring. In the case of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), as I saw earlier, \\( 3 \\cdot a = 0 \\) for all \\( a \\), and no smaller positive integer \\( n \\) satisfies this for all \\( a \\). Therefore, the characteristic is indeed 3.\n\nBut I've heard somewhere that the characteristic of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\times \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) is \\( p \\), but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm misremembering.\n\nLet me consider another approach. In ring theory, the characteristic of a ring \\( R \\) is defined as the characteristic of its additive group. So, what is the characteristic of the additive group of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\)?\n\nThe additive group of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), which is a group of order 9. However, the characteristic of an additive group is the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n \\cdot a = 0 \\) for all \\( a \\) in the group. In \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), the maximum order of any element is 3, and indeed, \\( 3 \\cdot a = 0 \\) for all \\( a \\), but no smaller positive integer \\( n \\) satisfies this.\n\nWait, but 3 is also the characteristic of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), and since both components are \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), their direct product should have the same characteristic.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that for finite rings, the characteristic divides the order of the ring. The order of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) is \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\), and the possible characteristics are divisors of 9, which are 1, 3, and 9. Since the ring is not the zero ring, the characteristic can't be 1. Between 3 and 9, 3 is the smallest positive integer that annihilates all elements, as I checked earlier.\n\nWait, but 9 is also a possibility. Let's see: in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_9 \\), the characteristic is 9 because \\( 9 \\cdot a = 0 \\) for all \\( a \\), but in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), as I saw, \\( 3 \\cdot a = 0 \\) for all \\( a \\), and \\( 9 \\cdot a = 0 \\) as well, but 3 is smaller.\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider that the characteristic is the smallest such \\( n \\), so even if 9 works, 3 is smaller and still satisfies the condition, so 3 should be the characteristic.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the characteristic of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) is the least common multiple of the characteristics of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) and \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), which is still 3.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The characteristic of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) is 3.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the definition again: the characteristic is the order of the multiplicative identity in the additive group. In \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), the multiplicative identity is \\( (1,1) \\), and its additive order is the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n \\cdot (1,1) = (0,0) \\). As we saw earlier, \\( 3 \\cdot (1,1) = (0,0) \\), and no smaller positive integer \\( n \\) satisfies this.\n\nTherefore, the characteristic is 3.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 3} \\]"
