                    "text": "So I have this question about frameshift mutations. Let's see what it's asking. A frameshift mutation is created when...\n\nOption A says telomeric sequences are removed from DNA. Hmm, telomeres are those repetitive sequences at the ends of chromosomes that protect our DNA. I think removing them would cause problems, but I don't recall if that specifically causes a frameshift mutation. Maybe not.\n\nOption B says a codon's nucleotide sequence changes so that it calls for production of a different amino acid than the original one. That sounds like a substitution mutation, where one nucleotide is replaced by another, leading to a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein. But is this a frameshift mutation? I think frameshift mutations involve changes in the reading frame of the genetic code, which usually happens when nucleotides are inserted or deleted. So, probably not option B.\n\nOption C says a base pair is either inserted or deleted in a gene. That sounds familiar. I think inserting or deleting a base pair can shift the reading frame of the genetic code, causing a frameshift mutation. Let me think about this. The genetic code is read in codons, which are three nucleotides each. If you insert or delete a base, it messes up the groups of three, right? For example, if you have a sequence like ATG CGA TGC, which reads as Met, Arg, Cys, and so on, and you insert a base, say, A, making it ATG CGA TAG C, now it reads as Met, Arg, Stop, because TAG is a stop codon. So, yes, that would be a frameshift mutation because the reading frame is shifted from the point of insertion onwards.\n\nOption D says a codon's nucleotide sequence is changed so that instead of coding for a given amino acid it acts to terminate translation. That sounds like a nonsense mutation, where a codon that originally specified an amino acid is changed to a stop codon. This would cause translation to stop prematurely, but I don't think it shifts the reading frame. It's more about changing one specific codon's meaning.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems to be the correct answer for creating a frameshift mutation. Inserting or deleting a base pair causes the reading frame to shift, which can lead to completely different amino acids being incorporated into the protein from that point on, and possibly a premature stop codon being encountered.\n\nLet me just double-check. Is there any chance that removing telomeric sequences could cause a frameshift mutation? Telomeres are at the ends of chromosomes, and they don't code for proteins. Frameshift mutations typically occur within genes that code for proteins. So, removing telomeric sequences might cause other problems, like chromosomal instability, but not directly a frameshift mutation.\n\nAnd for option D, a nonsense mutation would indeed cause premature termination, but it doesn't shift the reading frame; it just changes one codon's meaning. So, that shouldn't be considered a frameshift mutation.\n\nOption B is a missense mutation, where one amino acid is changed to another, but again, that's not a frameshift mutation. Frameshift mutations involve the shift in the reading frame due to insertions or deletions of nucleotides that aren't multiples of three.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: a base pair is either inserted or deleted in a gene.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
