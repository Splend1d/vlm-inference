                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the scenario is that there's a steamy mirror, and I want to see my full-face image by wiping away some of the steam. The question is asking for the minimum height of the patch I need to wipe to see my full face, compared to the height of my face itself. The options are A. one-quarter, B. one-half, C. the same, or D. dependent on my distance from the mirror.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some principles of reflection and mirror images. I know that in a plane mirror, the image formed is virtual, upright, and the same size as the object, with the image distance equal to the object distance. But here, it's not just about the entire image, but specifically about seeing my full face in a partially cleared area of the mirror.\n\nI think the key here is understanding how much of the mirror needs to be cleared to see the entire face. My face has a certain height, and I need to see all of it reflected in the mirror. So, perhaps I need to consider the angles of reflection and how they relate to the height of the mirror that's cleared.\n\nLet me think about the geometry involved. If I stand in front of the mirror, the top of my head is at a certain height from the floor, and my chin is at a lower height. The light from these points reflects off the mirror and enters my eyes. To see my entire face, the light rays from the top of my head and from my chin need to reach my eyes after reflection.\n\nSo, maybe I can model this with two rays: one from the top of my head to my eye, and another from my chin to my eye, both reflecting off the mirror. The point where these two rays intersect on the mirror would indicate the minimum height that needs to be cleared.\n\nI recall that in geometric optics, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. So, if I draw the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence, the angles on either side should be equal.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Suppose I'm standing a certain distance from the mirror. The top of my head is at height H above the floor, and my chin is at height h. My eyes are at some height e.\n\nThe ray from the top of my head reflects off the mirror and enters my eye. Similarly, the ray from my chin reflects off the mirror and enters my eye. The area between these two points on the mirror needs to be clear for me to see my entire face.\n\nWait, actually, in reality, for me to see my entire face, the entire area of the mirror that reflects both the top of my head and my chin needs to be clear. But perhaps there's a minimal rectangular patch that can capture both.\n\nLet me consider the mirror as a vertical plane. The height of the mirror that needs to be cleared should be such that it captures the reflection of both the top and bottom of my face.\n\nMaybe I can think of it in terms of similar triangles. If I draw the path of the rays from the top of my head to the mirror and then to my eye, and similarly for my chin, I can find the relationship between the heights.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula or a principle that directly relates the height of the mirror needed to see a certain height of the object.\n\nWait a minute, I remember something about the height of the mirror required to see a full body in a mirror. There's a famous problem in optics where you calculate that you only need a mirror half the height of the object to see the entire object, under certain conditions.\n\nLet me recall that. If I have an object of height H, and I want to see its entire height in a mirror, the mirror only needs to be H/2 in height, provided it's positioned correctly.\n\nBut in this case, it's about seeing my face in a steamy mirror, so maybe it's similar.\n\nBut the options include \"the same,\" \"one-quarter,\" \"one-half,\" and \"dependent on your distance from the mirror.\"\n\nOption D suggests that the required height depends on the distance from the mirror, which might be possible, but I need to think more carefully.\n\nLet me consider the mirror equation and the principles of reflection. In a plane mirror, the image distance is equal to the object distance, and the size of the image is the same as the object.\n\nBut here, it's not about the image size being the same, but about how much of the mirror needs to be cleared to see a specific part of the object.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the angles of incidence and reflection and how they relate to the heights.\n\nLet me try to draw a diagram in my mind. I'm standing a distance D from the mirror. The top of my head is at height H, and my chin is at height h. My eyes are at height E.\n\nThe ray from the top of my head reflects off the mirror and enters my eye. Similarly, the ray from my chin reflects off the mirror and enters my eye.\n\nIf I can find the vertical extent on the mirror where these two rays intersect, that would give me the required height to clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way to think about it.\n\nSuppose the mirror is very large, and I clear a small rectangular patch in the center. Would that be sufficient to see my entire face?\n\nProbably not, because the reflection from the top of my head would be higher up on the mirror, and the reflection from my chin would be lower.\n\nSo, I need to clear a vertical patch that captures both the reflection points.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it in terms of the mirror extending infinitely horizontally, and only having a finite vertical height that's cleared.\n\nIn that case, the minimum vertical height of the cleared patch would be equal to the height of my face, meaning option C, \"the same.\"\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because in the full-body mirror problem, you only need half the height.\n\nWait, maybe it's similar to the full-body mirror problem.\n\nLet me look that up quickly to refresh my memory.\n\nIn the full-body mirror problem, if you have an object of height H and you want to see its entire height in a mirror, the mirror only needs to be H/2 in height, provided it's positioned correctly.\n\nSo, in that case, the answer would be B, one-half.\n\nBut in this problem, it's about seeing my face in a steamy mirror, and the question is about the height of the patch to wipe away compared to the height of my face.\n\nI think it's analogous to the full-body mirror problem, where you only need half the height of the object to see the entire object in the mirror.\n\nTherefore, the minimum height of the patch to wipe away would be half the height of my face.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. one-half.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the mirror is half the height of my face, would that be sufficient to see my entire face?\n\nIn the full-body mirror problem, yes, because the top half of the mirror captures the upper part of the body, and the bottom half captures the lower part.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, if I clear a patch that's half the height of my face, it should be enough to see my entire face.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B. one-half.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
