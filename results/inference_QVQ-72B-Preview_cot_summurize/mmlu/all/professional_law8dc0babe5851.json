                    "text": "So I've got this land development scenario, and I need to figure out whether a homeowner in the western tract can successfully stop the country club from building a new high-rise complex on its property. Let me try to understand the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a land-development company that owns a 400-acre tract. Over time, they divided this land into two residential subdivisions: an eastern tract and a western tract, each with 150 acres. So, the total developed land is 300 acres, and there's 100 acres left.\n\nEach of these subdivisions was created by separate plats, and the restrictions in these plats are substantially the same. Specifically, the deeds say that the land is restricted to single-family dwellings only. This covenant is supposed to apply to every lot in the subdivision and bind all lot owners, their heirs, and assigns.\n\nAfter selling all but four lots in each subdivision, the land-development company sold 50 acres of the remaining 100 acres to a country club. The deed for this sale has some specific provisions:\n\n1. The property can be used as a country club with amenities like a golf course, pool, tennis courts, clubhouse, eating facilities, etc.\n\n2. The property can also be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern and western tracts, and then used in accordance with residential restrictions that conform to those in force against the eastern tract.\n\n3. There's a condition subsequent: if any of these restrictions are breached, the land-development company or its successors can re-enter and terminate the estate conveyed.\n\nAt the time of this conveyance, the land-development company still owned 50 acres of the original 400 acres. Later, they developed an exclusive shopping center on 25 acres of this retained land. So, they still had some land left.\n\nIn February 2001, the land-development company sold the remaining eight residential lots in the eastern and western tracts. Then, in March 2001, they executed an instrument to the country club, releasing, surrendering, and quitclaiming all rights, title, or other property interests in the country club's 50 acres.\n\nAt this point, the country club had built a clubhouse, golf course, and tennis courts on part of its 50 acres, and had 25 acres of vacant land left. Now, they want to build a new high-rise complex on this vacant 25 acres, which includes a hotel, shopping mall, apartments, etc.\n\nA homeowner in the western tract is trying to stop this construction, claiming it violates the deed restrictions. The question is whether this homeowner will most likely succeed.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Succeed because the homeowner (or any other landowner in the eastern or western tract) can re-enter the land upon breach of a condition subsequent.\n\nB. Succeed because a common development scheme has been established for the entire 400-acre tract, and the country club's proposed complex would be a non-conforming use.\n\nC. Not succeed because the land-development company's instrument of March 2001 abolished the deed restrictions on the country club's use of its property.\n\nD. Not succeed because, according to deed restriction (b), only a homeowner in the eastern tract would have standing to challenge the country club's proposed construction plan.\n\nOkay, let's analyze each option.\n\nOption A suggests that the homeowner can re-enter the land upon breach of a condition subsequent. But wait, the right to re-enter is specifically given to the land-development company, its successors, and assigns, per the condition subsequent in the deed to the country club. So, unless the homeowner can claim to be a successor or assign of the land-development company, which isn't clear here, they probably don't have the right to re-enter. Therefore, this option seems unlikely.\n\nOption B mentions a common development scheme for the entire 400-acre tract. A common development scheme typically refers to a situation where restrictions or covenants are imposed uniformly across a development to maintain a certain character or use of the property. In this case, the eastern and western tracts have restrictions limiting use to single-family dwellings, and the country club's property was initially restricted for country club use with specific amenities.\n\nHowever, the country club's deed also allows for the property to be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern tract, with restrictions conforming to those in force against the eastern tract. But in this scenario, the country club is proposing to build a high-rise complex with a hotel, shopping mall, and apartments, which doesn't conform to the single-family dwelling restrictions.\n\nBut wait, the country club's deed specifically allows for country club use and, alternatively, residential use similar to the eastern tract. It doesn't explicitly allow for commercial use like a hotel and shopping mall. So, if the country club wants to change the use from country club to something else, it needs to follow the provisions in the deed.\n\nOption C says that the instrument of March 2001 abolished the deed restrictions on the country club's property. Let's look at that instrument: it says the land-development company released, surrendered, and quitclaimed all rights, title, or other property interests in the country club's 50 acres. Does this mean that all previous deed restrictions are abolished?\n\nWell, typically, when you release your interest in property, you're giving up any claims you might have had to it. But does this include releasing the benefit of deed restrictions? That's a bit tricky.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, deed restrictions run with the land and bind not only the grantor and grantee but also their successors in interest. So, even if the land-development company releases its interest in the property, the restrictions might still bind the country club and future owners because these restrictions are covenants running with the land.\n\nHowever, if the release was intended to abolish the restrictions, and if it was properly recorded, it might have that effect. But the language of the release is \"release, surrender, and quitclaim all rights, title, or other property interests.\" Does this include the benefit of deed restrictions? Maybe not necessarily, because the restrictions are covenants that run with the land and are enforceable by other lot owners, not just the original grantor.\n\nOption D claims that only a homeowner in the eastern tract would have standing to challenge the country club's proposed construction plan, based on deed restriction (b). Wait, in the problem, deed restriction (b) is not clearly identified. Let's go back to the deed provisions for the country club.\n\nThe deed to the country club says:\n\n- It can be used as a country club with specified amenities.\n\n- It can also be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern tract and then used in accordance with residential restrictions that conform with those in force against the eastern tract.\n\n- There's a condition subsequent allowing the land-development company or its successors to re-enter and terminate the estate if the restrictions are breached.\n\nAdditionally, there's a provision that these restrictions are covenants running with the land, and for breach of any covenant, the land-development company, its successors, and assigns may re-enter and terminate the estate.\n\nNow, the question is, who has standing to enforce these restrictions? Generally, in covenant cases, the parties who can enforce the covenants are those who are expressly benefited by them or their successors in interest.\n\nIn this case, the covenants are intended to apply to each and every lot in the subdivision and bind every lot owner, their heirs, and assigns. So, it seems that all lot owners in the subdivisions are bound by and can enforce these covenants.\n\nHowever, the deed to the country club specifically mentions that the land-development company or its successors and assigns can enforce the restrictions by re-entering and terminating the estate upon breach. But that doesn't necessarily mean that only the land-development company or its successors can enforce the restrictions. Other lot owners might have the right to enforce the covenants through other means, such as injunctions or damages.\n\nSo, option D seems to suggest that only homeowners in the eastern tract have standing to challenge the country club's plans, but that doesn't seem right. Homeowners in the western tract are also bound by and benefit from the same restrictions, so they should have standing as well.\n\nNow, considering all this, let's think about whether the country club's proposed high-rise complex violates the deed restrictions.\n\nThe original restrictions on the subdivisions limit use to single-family dwellings only. The country club's deed allows for country club use or residential use similar to the eastern tract. Building a high-rise complex with a hotel, shopping mall, and apartments would not be consistent with single-family dwelling restrictions.\n\nTherefore, if the country club proceeds with this construction, it would be in violation of the deed restrictions.\n\nBut wait, the country club has 25 acres of vacant land left. If they wanted to subdivide this land into residential lots with single-family dwellings, that would conform to the restrictions. However, building a high-rise complex with commercial and multi-family uses does not conform.\n\nSo, unless there's something that abolishes or modifies these restrictions, the country club cannot proceed with the high-rise complex.\n\nOption C suggests that the March 2001 instrument abolished the deed restrictions. But as I thought earlier, releasing all rights, title, or other property interests in the country club's 50 acres might not necessarily abolish the deed restrictions, especially since these restrictions are covenants running with the land and bind all subsequent owners.\n\nMoreover, the instrument was executed by the land-development company, which had already conveyed the property to the country club with specific restrictions. If the land-development company wanted to modify or abolish these restrictions, they would need to do so explicitly and possibly with the consent of the country club and perhaps other parties affected by the restrictions.\n\nIn this case, there's no indication that the restrictions were being modified or abolished, other than the release of the land-development company's interests. So, it's unlikely that this release abolished the restrictions.\n\nTherefore, the country club's proposed high-rise complex would violate the deed restrictions, and a homeowner in the western tract should be able to enjoin the construction.\n\nBut wait, option B says that the homeowner will most likely succeed because a common development scheme has been established for the entire 400-acre tract, and the country club's proposed complex would be a non-conforming use.\n\nWhile it's true that there's a common development scheme with restrictions on residential use, the country club's property was specifically allowed to be used as a country club or, alternatively, as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern tract. So, the country club's use is not entirely the same as the residential lots; it has some flexibility.\n\nHowever, building a high-rise complex with commercial elements is beyond what's allowed by the restrictions. So, even within the framework of the common development scheme, this use would be a violation.\n\nTherefore, option B seems plausible.\n\nOption C seems less likely, as the release of the land-development company's interests probably doesn't abolish the deed restrictions.\n\nOption D is incorrect because homeowners in both the eastern and western tracts should have standing to enforce the covenants.\n\nOption A is also unlikely, as the right to re-enter is specifically given to the land-development company, not to individual homeowners.\n\nSo, between options A, B, C, and D, option B seems the most accurate.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nSuppose the homeowner in the western tract files a lawsuit to enjoin the construction of the high-rise complex. What legal theory would they use?\n\nThey would likely argue that the country club's proposed use violates the deed restrictions that run with the land and are enforceable by all lot owners in the subdivisions.\n\nThe country club might argue that the restrictions don't apply to their property in the way the homeowner claims, or that the release by the land-development company abolished the restrictions.\n\nHowever, as I thought earlier, the release likely doesn't abolish the restrictions, especially since they are covenants running with the land.\n\nAlternatively, the country club might argue that their deed allows for residential use similar to the eastern tract, and that building a high-rise complex is a form of residential use, albeit with commercial components.\n\nBut the restrictions in the eastern tract specify single-family dwellings only. So, a high-rise complex with apartments and a hotel would not qualify as single-family dwellings.\n\nTherefore, the country club's proposed use is clearly in violation of the deed restrictions.\n\nHence, the homeowner in the western tract should be able to successfully enjoin the construction.\n\nSo, the answer is that the homeowner will most likely succeed, because a common development scheme has been established for the entire 400-acre tract, and the country club's proposed complex would constitute a non-conforming use.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
