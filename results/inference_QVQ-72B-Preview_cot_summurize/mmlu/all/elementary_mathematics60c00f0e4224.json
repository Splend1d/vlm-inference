                    "text": "So I have this problem: find the product of 5.7(8) mentally using the distributive property. I need to choose from options A through D. Let me see.\n\nFirst off, I know that the distributive property is about distributing a number over the sum or difference of two numbers. So, if I have 5.7 times 8, I can break down 5.7 into parts that are easier to multiply by 8.\n\nLet me think about how to break down 5.7. It's the same as 5 + 0.7. So, I can write 5.7 as 5 + 0.7. Now, using the distributive property, I can multiply each part by 8 separately and then add those products together.\n\nSo, 5.7 \u00d7 8 = (5 + 0.7) \u00d7 8 = (5 \u00d7 8) + (0.7 \u00d7 8).\n\nI know that 5 \u00d7 8 is 40 and 0.7 \u00d7 8 is 5.6. So, adding those together, 40 + 5.6 equals 45.6.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check. 5.7 times 8. Well, 6 times 8 is 48, and 5.7 is a bit less than 6, so 5.7 \u00d7 8 should be less than 48. 45.6 is less than 48, so that seems plausible.\n\nLet me consider another way to look at it. Maybe I can think of 5.7 as 57 tenths. So, 57 tenths times 8 would be 57 times 8 tenths. Wait, that might not help right now.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider 5.7 \u00d7 8 as (6 - 0.3) \u00d7 8. But that might complicate things more.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I can use the fact that 5.7 is the same as 5 + 0.7, and then multiply each by 8, like I did before. Yeah, that seems straightforward.\n\nSo, 5 \u00d7 8 is 40, and 0.7 \u00d7 8 is 5.6. Adding those together gives 45.6.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 46.4\n\nB. 456\n\nC. 4.56\n\nD. 45.6\n\nSo, 45.6 is option D. But just to make sure, maybe I should check if there's another way to get the same answer.\n\nAnother way could be to think about 5.7 \u00d7 8 as (5 + 0.7) \u00d7 8, which is the same as what I did before. Or, I could consider 5.7 \u00d7 8 = 45.6 by directly multiplying.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think in terms of cents. If I imagine 5.7 as 5 dollars and 70 cents, then 5 dollars times 8 is 40 dollars, and 70 cents times 8 is 560 cents, which is 5 dollars and 60 cents. Adding that to the 40 dollars gives 45 dollars and 60 cents, which is 45.6 dollars. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the standard multiplication algorithm, but since we're supposed to do it mentally, that might not be the best approach.\n\nLet me see if 45.6 is indeed the correct answer. Let me perform the multiplication again to confirm.\n\n5.7 \u00d7 8:\n\n- 0.7 \u00d7 8 = 5.6\n\n- 5 \u00d7 8 = 40\n\n- Add them together: 40 + 5.6 = 45.6\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can use the vertical multiplication method to verify.\n\nSetting it up:\n\n```\n\n  5 . 7\n\n\u00d7   8\n\n------\n\n```\n\n5 \u00d7 8 = 40, write down 40, but in decimal multiplication, I need to count the decimal places. There's one decimal place in 5.7, and 8 has none, so the result should have one decimal place. But when I multiply 5.7 by 8, I get 45.6, which has one decimal place. So, that checks out.\n\nWait, but option B is 456, which is much larger. That can't be right because 5.7 \u00d7 8 should be less than 6 \u00d7 8, which is 48, and 45.6 is less than 48.\n\nOption A is 46.4, which is more than 45.6, so that doesn't match.\n\nOption C is 4.56, which seems too small compared to 5.7 \u00d7 8.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. 45.6.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently using different methods, so I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 45.6} \\]"
