                    "text": "Alright, I need to find the product of 32 and 67. So, I have to calculate 32 times 67. Let's see, I can do this using the standard multiplication algorithm that I learned in school.\n\nFirst, I'll write down 32 and 67 like this:\n\n```\n\n  32\n\n\u00d7 67\n\n------\n\n```\n\nNow, I need to multiply 32 by 7 and then by 60, and add them up. Wait, no, actually, it's better to think of 67 as 7 in the ones place and 6 in the tens place. So, I'll multiply 32 by 7 and then by 60, and then add those results together.\n\nFirst, 32 \u00d7 7.\n\n30 \u00d7 7 is 210, and 2 \u00d7 7 is 14. So, 210 + 14 is 224.\n\nSo, the first partial product is 224.\n\nNext, 32 \u00d7 60.\n\n30 \u00d7 60 is 1,800, and 2 \u00d7 60 is 120. So, 1,800 + 120 is 1,920.\n\nThis is the second partial product.\n\nNow, I need to add these two partial products together: 224 + 1,920.\n\nLet's see, 200 + 1,900 is 2,100, and then 24 + 20 is 44. So, 2,100 + 44 is 2,144.\n\nTherefore, 32 \u00d7 67 equals 2,144.\n\nWait a minute, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with 32 \u00d7 7:\n\n32 \u00d7 7 =\n\n(30 \u00d7 7) + (2 \u00d7 7) =\n\n210 + 14 =\n\n224.\n\nOkay, that's correct.\n\nNow, 32 \u00d7 60:\n\n(30 \u00d7 60) + (2 \u00d7 60) =\n\n1,800 + 120 =\n\n1,920.\n\nThat's right.\n\nThen, adding them up:\n\n224 + 1,920 =\n\nFirst, 200 + 1,900 = 2,100.\n\nThen, 24 + 20 = 44.\n\nSo, 2,100 + 44 = 2,144.\n\nEverything checks out. So, the answer should be 2,144.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1,824\n\nB. 1,934\n\nC. 2,044\n\nD. 2,144\n\nSo, option D is 2,144, which matches my calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can use another method to verify this.\n\nAnother way to do this is to use the standard vertical multiplication method.\n\nWriting 32 and 67 one below the other:\n\n```\n\n  32\n\n\u00d7 67\n\n------\n\n```\n\nNow, multiply 32 by 7:\n\n2 \u00d7 7 = 14, write down 14.\n\nThen, multiply 30 by 7:\n\n0 \u00d7 7 = 0, and 3 \u00d7 7 = 21, so 210.\n\nNow, move to the next digit in 67, which is 6, and multiply by 32, but shifted one place to the left.\n\nSo, 32 \u00d7 6 = 192, but since it's shifted left, it becomes 1,920.\n\nNow, add these two results:\n\n224 (from 32 \u00d7 7) +\n\n1,920 (from 32 \u00d7 60) =\n\n2,144.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think that's solid. No mistakes here.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the distributive property:\n\n32 \u00d7 67 = 32 \u00d7 (60 + 7) = (32 \u00d7 60) + (32 \u00d7 7) = 1,920 + 224 = 2,144.\n\nSame result.\n\nOr, I could break it differently, like 67 \u00d7 32.\n\n67 \u00d7 30 = 2,010, and 67 \u00d7 2 = 134. Then, 2,010 + 134 = 2,144.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSeems consistent across different methods. I'm confident that 2,144 is the correct product of 32 and 67.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can use a calculator to confirm.\n\nWait, but since this is a thought process exercise, I don't have a calculator right now. But based on the multiple methods I've used, I'm pretty sure that 2,144 is the right answer.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2,144, which corresponds to option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
