                    "text": " So I'm trying to understand this question about Thomas Nagel's view on moral dilemmas and how it relates to different moral principles involving \"can,\" \"should,\" and \"ought.\" The question says that since Nagel thinks there can be genuine moral dilemmas, he denies the moral principle that... and then gives four options:\n\nA. can implies should.\n\nB. can implies ought.\n\nC. ought implies can.\n\nD. ought implies should.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Nagel believes about moral dilemmas. I remember that some philosophers argue that in a genuine moral dilemma, a person faces two or more conflicting moral obligations, and no matter which one they choose, they will violate at least one of them. Nagel, I think, is open to the idea that such dilemmas can exist.\n\nNow, the question is about which moral principle he denies because of this acceptance of genuine moral dilemmas. To figure this out, I need to understand what each option means.\n\nLet's start with option A: \"can implies should.\" This seems to suggest that if you are capable of doing something (you can), then you ought to do it (you should). But I'm not entirely sure if this is the standard interpretation. Maybe it's better to think in terms of moral obligations.\n\nOption B: \"can implies ought.\" This seems similar to option A but uses \"ought\" instead of \"should.\" \"Ought\" is often used interchangeably with \"should\" in moral contexts, but sometimes \"ought\" is used to denote a stronger moral obligation. However, for the purpose of this question, I'll consider \"should\" and \"ought\" as similar in meaning, unless specified otherwise.\n\nOption C: \"ought implies can.\" This principle suggests that if you have a moral obligation to do something (you ought to do it), then it must be possible for you to do it (you can do it). This seems like a common-sense principle: you shouldn't be expected to do something that's impossible for you.\n\nOption D: \"ought implies should.\" This seems redundant because \"ought\" and \"should\" are similar in meaning. So, saying \"ought implies should\" is almost like saying \"if you ought to do it, you should do it,\" which is tautological.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option D isn't the one Nagel would deny, since it's more of a truism.\n\nNow, considering that Nagel accepts genuine moral dilemmas, where no matter what you choose, you violate some moral obligation, this challenges the idea that all moral obligations can be fulfilled simultaneously.\n\nIf there are genuine moral dilemmas, then it's possible to be in a situation where you ought to do A and you ought to do B, but doing A makes B impossible, and vice versa. In such a case, no matter what you choose, you end up violating at least one ought.\n\nThis seems to contradict the principle that \"ought implies can.\" If \"ought implies can\" were true, then you shouldn't have conflicting oughts that are impossible to satisfy simultaneously. But if Nagel accepts genuine moral dilemmas, he must deny that \"ought implies can\" always holds, because in some cases, you ought to do something that you can't do due to conflicting obligations.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If \"ought implies can\" is true, then for any moral obligation, there must be a way to fulfill it. But in a moral dilemma, fulfilling one obligation makes it impossible to fulfill another, so \"ought implies can\" would be violated.\n\nTherefore, if Nagel accepts genuine moral dilemmas, he must deny the principle that \"ought implies can.\"\n\nOn the other hand, denying \"can implies should\" or \"can implies ought\" would suggest that even if you can do something, you don't necessarily have a moral obligation to do it. That seems like a different issue, not directly related to moral dilemmas.\n\nOption D, \"ought implies should,\" as I thought earlier, seems too close to a tautology to be the principle Nagel would deny in this context.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that Nagel denies the moral principle that \"ought implies can\" because he accepts the possibility of genuine moral dilemmas.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
