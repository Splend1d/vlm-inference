                    "text": "So I've got this number pattern here: 20, 40, 60, 80, and it's supposed to continue by adding the same amount each time to get the next number. I need to find out what the eighth number in this pattern is.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what's being added each time. Looking at the sequence:\n\n20 to 40: that's an increase of 20.\n\n40 to 60: again, an increase of 20.\n\n60 to 80: still, an increase of 20.\n\nSo, it looks like each time, we're adding 20 to get the next number. That makes sense because it's a consistent difference between each pair of consecutive numbers.\n\nNow, the sequence is: 20, 40, 60, 80, ...\n\nI need to find the eighth number in this pattern. Let's list out the numbers one by one until I reach the eighth one.\n\nFirst number: 20\n\nSecond number: 40\n\nThird number: 60\n\nFourth number: 80\n\nFifth number: 80 + 20 = 100\n\nSixth number: 100 + 20 = 120\n\nSeventh number: 120 + 20 = 140\n\nEighth number: 140 + 20 = 160\n\nOkay, so the eighth number is 160. But let's double-check if there's a faster way to find this without listing all the numbers.\n\nI recall that in an arithmetic sequence, where each term is obtained by adding a constant difference, the nth term can be found using the formula:\n\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n\nWhere:\n\n- a_n is the nth term\n\n- a_1 is the first term\n\n- n is the term number\n\n- d is the common difference\n\nIn this case, a_1 = 20, d = 20, and n = 8.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\na_8 = 20 + (8 - 1) * 20\n\na_8 = 20 + 7 * 20\n\na_8 = 20 + 140\n\na_8 = 160\n\nSo, using the formula also gives me 160 as the eighth term. That matches what I got by listing the numbers sequentially.\n\nLet me just make sure that this formula is correct. Yeah, I think it's standard for arithmetic sequences. It makes sense because you start with the first term and add the common difference (d) seven times to get to the eighth term.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the pattern being additive. Since each term increases by 20, the eighth term would indeed be the first term plus seven increments of 20.\n\nSo, 20 + (7 * 20) = 20 + 140 = 160.\n\nThat confirms it again.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other way this question could be interpreted. For example, maybe the pattern isn't just adding 20 each time, but something else. But the problem states that Umi is adding the same amount each time to get the next number, so it's clearly an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 20.\n\nAnother thought: since the sequence is linear, and the difference is constant, there's no need to consider higher powers or anything like that. It's straightforward arithmetic progression.\n\nSo, based on all these approaches, I'm confident that the eighth number in the pattern is 160.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 160\n\nB. 240\n\nC. 320\n\nD. 640\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A. 160.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 160} \\]"
