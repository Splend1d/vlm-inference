The dependent variable is usually denoted by y, and I know that it's the variable we're trying to predict or explain using the independent variables.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\n(i) The regressand: I think this is another name for the dependent variable. In some textbooks, they refer to the dependent variable as the regressand. So, this seems like a possible choice.\n\n(ii) The regressor: I believe this term refers to the independent variable, not the dependent one. The regressor is the variable that we use to explain the dependent variable. So, this seems like it's referring to x, not y.\n\n(iii) The explained variable: This sounds like it could be the dependent variable. The dependent variable is the one that's being explained by the independent variables. So, this also seems like a likely choice.\n\n(iv) The explanatory variable: This seems to refer to the independent variable, which is the one used to explain the dependent variable. So, this is probably referring to x, not y.\n\nFrom this, it looks like (i) the regressand and (iii) the explained variable are both alternative names for the dependent variable in linear regression analysis. On the other hand, (ii) the regressor and (iv) the explanatory variable seem to refer to the independent variables.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. (i) and (iii) only.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. In linear regression, we have:\n\ny = \u03b20 + \u03b21 x + \u03b5\n\nWhere y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, \u03b20 and \u03b21 are the coefficients, and \u03b5 is the error term.\n\n- Regressand: This is often used to refer to y.\n\n- Regressor: This is typically used to refer to x.\n\n- Explained variable: Yes, this is y, since it's the variable being explained.\n\n- Explanatory variable: This is x, as it explains y.\n\nTherefore, (i) and (iii) are indeed alternative names for the dependent variable.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
