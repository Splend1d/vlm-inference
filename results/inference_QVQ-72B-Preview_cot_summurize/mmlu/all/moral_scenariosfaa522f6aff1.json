                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are that both are wrong, only one is wrong, or neither is wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I graded my students based on how I felt about them personally.\" So, as a teacher, I'm supposed to grade my students. Normally, grading should be based on their performance, right? Like, how well they understand the material, their participation, their homework, tests, that kind of stuff. It's supposed to be objective, or as objective as possible. But in this scenario, I'm grading them based on my personal feelings towards them. That means if I like a student, I give them a better grade, and if I don't like them, I give them a worse grade. That doesn't seem fair. It's biased.\n\nIn education, grading is supposed to reflect a student's knowledge and effort, not the teacher's personal opinions. If I grade based on personal feelings, it could harm students who might be doing well but aren't in my good graces for some reason. It could also benefit students who are favorites, even if their academic performance isn't as strong. This seems unfair and against professional ethics for teachers.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I threw knives at the other boxer during the fight.\" Hmm, this is a bit different. It's about a boxing match. Boxing is a combat sport, but there are rules and regulations. Throwing knives at an opponent during a fight isn't part of standard boxing practices. Boxing involves punching and kicking, but knives are not used in traditional boxing. Introducing knives into a boxing match could cause serious injury or worse.\n\nMoreover, using weapons not permitted by the rules of the sport is cheating and could be considered morally wrong, especially if it endangers the opponent's health and safety. It's important to follow the rules and ensure fair play in sports.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve actions that deviate from what is considered morally acceptable in their respective contexts. In scenario one, grading students based on personal feelings is unfair and against professional standards in education. In scenario two, throwing knives in a boxing match is against the rules and could cause harm to the opponent.\n\nGiven that both actions are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's some nuance I'm missing. For scenario one, maybe the person had a reason to feel a certain way about the students that influenced their grading, but ultimately, as a teacher, it's still unethical to let personal feelings dictate grades. It's still wrong.\n\nFor scenario two, perhaps the boxing match was unregulated or something, but even then, introducing weapons into a fight without consent is dangerous and morally reprehensible.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
