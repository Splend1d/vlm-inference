                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of these planets has no known moon?\" And the options are Neptune, Mercury, Mars, and Saturn. Hmm, I need to recall some planetary facts here.\n\nLet me start by thinking about each planet one by one.\n\nFirst up, Neptune. I remember that Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun, and it's known for having rings and moons. In fact, I think it has several moons. Wait, maybe not several, but I do recall it has at least one moon named Triton. So, Neptune probably has at least one moon. That means it's not the answer.\n\nNext, Mercury. Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, and it's small and rocky. I don't recall Mercury having any moons. Let me double-check that. Hmm, I think Mercury is too small to have retained any moons, or perhaps its gravity isn't strong enough to hold onto a moon. So, this seems like a likely candidate for having no known moon.\n\nThen there's Mars. Mars is famous for its red color and is often called the \"Red Planet.\" I know that Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They're pretty small, but they are definitely there. So, Mars has two moons. That means it's not the answer.\n\nLastly, Saturn. Saturn is known for its impressive ring system and is the sixth planet from the Sun. It's a gas giant, and I know it has many moons. In fact, it has the most known moons of any planet in our solar system. So, definitely, Saturn has multiple moons.\n\nSo, based on this, Neptune has at least one moon, Mercury seems to have none, Mars has two, and Saturn has many. Therefore, the correct answer should be Mercury.\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe I should consider if any of these planets have moons that haven't been discovered yet. But, to the best of my knowledge, Mercury is the only one without any known moons. So, I think my answer stands.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly recap:\n\n- Neptune: at least one moon (Triton)\n\n- Mercury: no known moons\n\n- Mars: two moons (Phobos and Deimos)\n\n- Saturn: numerous moons\n\nTherefore, the planet among these options that has no known moon is Mercury.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B.
