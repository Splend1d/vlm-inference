                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a cylinder with a movable piston containing a gas. The initial conditions are pressure P equals 1 times 10 to the power of 5 Pascals, volume V is 20 cubic centimeters, and temperature T is 273 Kelvin. Then, the piston is moved downward slowly, and heat is escaping so that the temperature remains constant. The final volume is 5 cubic centimeters, and I need to find the resulting pressure.\n\nFirst off, since the temperature is remaining constant throughout this process, it sounds like an isothermal process. I remember that in an isothermal process for an ideal gas, the pressure and volume are related by Boyle's Law, which states that pressure times volume equals a constant. So, P initial times V initial equals P final times V final, or P1V1 = P2V2.\n\nGiven that, I have the initial pressure and volume, and the final volume, so I can rearrange the equation to solve for the final pressure: P2 = (P1V1)/V2.\n\nPlugging in the values I have:\n\nP2 = (1 \u00d7 10^5 Pa \u00d7 20 cm\u00b3)/5 cm\u00b3\n\nWait a minute, the units need to be consistent. Pressure is in Pascals, which is Newtons per meter squared, and volume is in cubic centimeters. I should probably convert the volume from cubic centimeters to cubic meters since the standard unit for volume in relation to pressure in Pascals is cubic meters.\n\nI know that 1 cm\u00b3 = 1 \u00d7 10^-6 m\u00b3. So, V initial = 20 cm\u00b3 = 20 \u00d7 10^-6 m\u00b3 = 2 \u00d7 10^-5 m\u00b3, and V final = 5 cm\u00b3 = 5 \u00d7 10^-6 m\u00b3.\n\nNow, plugging these values back into the equation:\n\nP2 = (1 \u00d7 10^5 Pa \u00d7 2 \u00d7 10^-5 m\u00b3)/5 \u00d7 10^-6 m\u00b3\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, 1 \u00d7 10^5 times 2 \u00d7 10^-5 is:\n\n1 \u00d7 10^5 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 10^-5 = 2 \u00d7 10^(5 + (-5)) = 2 \u00d7 10^0 = 2 Pa m\u00b3\n\nThen, divide by 5 \u00d7 10^-6 m\u00b3:\n\n2 Pa m\u00b3 / (5 \u00d7 10^-6 m\u00b3) = (2 / 5) \u00d7 1 / 10^-6 Pa = 0.4 \u00d7 10^6 Pa\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nActually, when dividing 2 by 5, I get 0.4, and then dividing by 10^-6 is the same as multiplying by 10^6, so 0.4 \u00d7 10^6 Pa.\n\nBut 0.4 \u00d7 10^6 Pa is 4 \u00d7 10^5 Pa.\n\nSo, the final pressure should be 4 \u00d7 10^5 Pascals.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 0.25 \u00d7 10^5 Pa\n\nB. 2 \u00d7 10^5 Pa\n\nC. 4 \u00d7 10^5 Pa\n\nD. 8 \u00d7 10^5 Pa\n\nSo, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way.\n\nStarting with P1V1 = P2V2, and plugging in the values correctly, ensuring that units are consistent.\n\nInitial pressure P1 = 1 \u00d7 10^5 Pa\n\nInitial volume V1 = 20 cm\u00b3 = 2 \u00d7 10^-5 m\u00b3\n\nFinal volume V2 = 5 cm\u00b3 = 5 \u00d7 10^-6 m\u00b3\n\nThen, P2 = (P1V1)/V2 = (1e5 * 2e-5)/5e-6 = (2e-5 * 1e5)/5e-6 = 2/5 * (1e5 / 1e-6) = 0.4 * 1e11 = 4e10 Pa\n\nWait, that doesn't match. I must have messed up the exponents.\n\nLet me try again more carefully.\n\nFirst, 1 \u00d7 10^5 Pa = 100,000 Pa\n\n20 cm\u00b3 = 0.00002 m\u00b3 = 2 \u00d7 10^-5 m\u00b3\n\n5 cm\u00b3 = 0.000005 m\u00b3 = 5 \u00d7 10^-6 m\u00b3\n\nSo, P2 = (100,000 * 2e-5) / 5e-6\n\nCalculate 100,000 * 2e-5 = 100,000 * 0.00002 = 2\n\nThen, 2 / 5e-6 = 2 / 0.000005 = 2 / 0.000005 = 400,000 Pa\n\nWhich is 4 \u00d7 10^5 Pa.\n\nOkay, that matches option C.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the relationship in terms of pressure and volume inversely proportional in an isothermal process, since PV = constant.\n\nSo, if volume decreases, pressure increases proportionally to maintain the product constant.\n\nGiven that, if volume decreases from 20 cm\u00b3 to 5 cm\u00b3, which is a factor of 4 decrease in volume, pressure should increase by a factor of 4.\n\nSo, P2 = P1 * (V1 / V2) = 1e5 * (20 / 5) = 1e5 * 4 = 4e5 Pa\n\nAgain, that confirms P2 = 4 \u00d7 10^5 Pa.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 4 \u00d7 10^5 Pa.\n\nI think that's solid. No need to consider temperature changes since it's an isothermal process, and temperature remains constant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
