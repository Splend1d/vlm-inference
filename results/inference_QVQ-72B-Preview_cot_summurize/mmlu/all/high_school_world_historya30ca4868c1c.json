                    "text": "So I've got this excerpt from \"Germania\" by Publius Cornelius Tacitus, written around 98 C.E. It's about some tribal conflicts in Germany, and Tacitus seems pretty engaged with what's going on. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst, he mentions that the Tencteri came before the Bructeri, but now it's said that the Chamavi and Angrivarii took over their settlements. These Chamavi and Angrivarii drove out the Bructeri and apparently wiped them out with the help of neighboring tribes. The reasons given are either hatred of the Bructeri's tyranny, the lure of plunder, or divine favor towards the Romans.\n\nTacitus then says that over sixty thousand people fell in this conflict, and importantly, not at the hands of the Romans, but rather among the tribes themselves. He seems pleased about this, almost like he's celebrating that these tribes are fighting each other without the Romans having to get involved.\n\nHe concludes by hoping that these tribes will continue to hate each other rather than love the Romans, because their discord benefits Roman interests. He sees their discord as a greater gift than even Roman military might, and he prays that this state of affairs continues as Rome expands its empire.\n\nNow, the question is asking what views expressed here can be seen as evidence of in Roman society. The options are:\n\nA. Disgust for barbarian peoples\n\nB. Concern about barbarian attacks\n\nC. Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy\n\nD. Maintenance of large armies\n\nLet me consider each option.\n\nOption A: Disgust for barbarian peoples.\n\nWell, Tacitus does refer to these Germanic tribes as \"barbarians,\" but does he express disgust for them? He seems more interested in their conflicts and how they can benefit Rome. He doesn't explicitly express disgust, but perhaps there's an underlying sentiment of superiority.\n\nOption B: Concern about barbarian attacks.\n\nTacitus doesn't directly express concern about attacks. Instead, he's glad that the tribes are fighting among themselves, which suggests that their internal conflicts might make them less of a threat to Rome.\n\nOption C: Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy.\n\nStoicism is a philosophy that emphasizes virtue, reason, and self-control. Tacitus was part of the Roman aristocracy, but does this passage show a lack of Stoicism? It's hard to say. He's expressing satisfaction at the outcome of these tribal conflicts, but whether that's against Stoic principles isn't entirely clear.\n\nOption D: Maintenance of large armies.\n\nThe passage mentions that over sixty thousand fell in battle, but it doesn't directly relate to the size of Roman armies. Tacitus notes that the Romans didn't have to fight; the tribes fought each other.\n\nHmm, none of these seem to perfectly capture what's being expressed here. Let me think differently.\n\nTacitus is clearly pleased that the tribes are fighting each other without Roman intervention. He sees their discord as beneficial to Rome's expansion. This suggests a pragmatic view of international relations, where Roman interests are served by keeping potential enemies occupied with their own conflicts.\n\nOption A suggests disgust for barbarians, but while Tacitus might have a low opinion of them, his primary focus seems to be on how their actions serve Roman interests.\n\nOption B, concern about barbarian attacks, isn't really supported by the passage. He's more concerned with their infighting benefiting Rome.\n\nOption C, absence of Stoicism, is too vague. The passage doesn't provide enough information to judge Tacitus's adherence to Stoic principles.\n\nOption D, maintenance of large armies, isn't directly addressed in the passage. The focus is on the tribal conflicts, not on Roman military structure.\n\nPerhaps none of the options perfectly fit, or maybe I'm missing something. Let me consider the context.\n\nTacitus was a Roman historian writing during the Flavian dynasty. His works often commented on the state of the empire and the character of its people. In \"Germania,\" he describes the Germanic tribes and their customs, sometimes drawing contrasts with Roman society.\n\nGiven that, perhaps his satisfaction at the tribal conflicts reflects a broader Roman attitude towards managing potential threats through divide and conquer strategies, without necessarily directly engaging military resources.\n\nBut still, the question is asking for evidence in Roman society based on the views expressed.\n\nLet me look back at the question: \"The views expressed in the excerpt are best seen as evidence of which of the following in Roman society?\"\n\nSo, I need to identify which option is most directly supported by Tacitus's views in this passage.\n\nHe expresses pleasure at the tribal conflicts and hopes for continued discord among the tribes, as it benefits Roman interests.\n\nThis seems to reflect a strategic view of keeping potential enemies weakened by fighting among themselves, which aligns with Roman imperial policy.\n\nOption A, disgust for barbarians, might be part of it, but it's not the main point. His pleasure seems more about the strategic advantage than disgust.\n\nOption B, concern about barbarian attacks, isn't supported because he's glad they're fighting each other, implying less threat to Rome.\n\nOption C, absence of Stoicism, is too broad and not directly related to the content of the passage.\n\nOption D, maintenance of large armies, isn't directly addressed here, as the passage focuses on tribal conflicts, not Roman military structure.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is Option A, disgust for barbarian peoples, because Tacitus refers to them fighting over tyranny, plunder, or divine favor towards Rome, which might imply a low opinion of their character.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely convinced, as his primary focus seems to be on the strategic advantage, not solely on disgust.\n\nMaybe I should consider that his hope for continued hatred among the tribes indicates a desire for them to remain weak and divided, which could be seen as a reflection of Roman attitudes towards barbarians as inherently conflict-prone and thus easy to manage through their divisions.\n\nThat might suggest a certain disdain or disgust for their inability to unite, which could align with Option A.\n\nAlternatively, it could be seen as a realistic assessment of the situation, without necessarily implying disgust.\n\nI think I'll go with Option A, disgust for barbarian peoples, as the closest fit based on the views expressed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
