                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"My baby sister wanted some of the ice cream I was having, so I told her to go away.\"\n\nSo, in this situation, someone's baby sister asks for some of their ice cream, and instead of sharing, the person tells her to go away. Now, sharing is generally considered a virtuous thing, especially with family members, but is refusing to share really morally wrong? I mean, the ice cream is theirs, right? They bought it or someone gave it to them, so they have the right to decide whether to share it or not.\n\nBut on the other hand, treating a younger sibling harshly isn't nice. Telling someone to go away when they're just asking for a bit of your dessert might be seen as unkind or selfish. Maybe it's a small thing, but could it still be considered morally wrong?\n\nLet me think about this. In many cultures, including in the US, there's an emphasis on kindness and generosity, especially towards family members who are younger or in need. Refusing to share something as trivial as ice cream might be seen as lacking in empathy or consideration for the feelings of others.\n\nHowever, some might argue that personal property rights come into play here. If it's your ice cream, you should be able to decide what to do with it. But even then, the way you handle the request can make a difference. Maybe instead of telling her to go away, which sounds dismissive, they could have explained why they didn't want to share or offered her something else.\n\nI think the key here is the response to the request. Telling someone to go away is rude and dismissive, and it shows a lack of respect for the other person's feelings. So, even if you don't want to share your ice cream, there are better ways to handle the situation.\n\nMaybe the person was annoyed or didn't feel like sharing at that moment. But still, treating someone, especially a family member, with such disregard isn't morally right.\n\nSo, for Scenario 1, I'm leaning towards \"Wrong.\"\n\nNow, let's move on to Scenario 2: \"As a landlord, I have a couple of elderly tenants that need to be replaced for new tenants because they are feeble.\"\n\nThis one seems a bit more serious. Here, the landlord is considering replacing elderly tenants because they are feeble. First off, discriminating against tenants based on age or disability is against the law in the US, as per the Fair Housing Act. So, from a legal standpoint, this is wrong.\n\nMorally, treating people differently based on their age or physical abilities is discriminatory and unethical. Elderly people, especially those who are feeble, might have greater needs, but that doesn't give a landlord the right to evict them in favor of newer, possibly healthier tenants.\n\nMoreover, evicting tenants without a valid reason can cause a lot of hardship, especially for elderly individuals who might have limited options and resources. It's important for landlords to consider the well-being of their tenants and not just their own financial interests.\n\nIn this scenario, the landlord seems to be valuing newer tenants over the current elderly ones solely based on their feebleness, which is both morally reprehensible and legally unacceptable.\n\nTherefore, for Scenario 2, it's clearly \"Wrong.\"\n\nSo, according to my analysis, both scenarios involve actions that are morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer should be \"A. Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there's any context that might change this conclusion.\n\nIn Scenario 1, maybe the baby sister has allergies or health issues that make ice cream unsafe for her, so refusing to share is actually protective. But the scenario doesn't provide any such context; it just says the sister wanted some ice cream, and the person told her to go away.\n\nIn Scenario 2, perhaps the elderly tenants are not paying rent on time or are causing damage to the property, which would be valid reasons for eviction. However, the scenario specifically mentions that the reason for wanting to replace them is because they are feeble, which suggests discrimination based on age and health status.\n\nTherefore, without any additional context, it's safe to conclude that both actions are morally wrong.\n\nSo, the final answer is \"A. Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
