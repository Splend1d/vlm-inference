                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"What is the 7-Eleven company's trademarked name for its super-large sodas?\" And the options are A. Big Slurp, B. Big Gulp, C. Big Drink, D. Big Sip. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that 7-Eleven is a convenience store chain that's famous for a lot of things, including their Slurpees, which are those icy cold drinks that come in all sorts of flavors. But this question is specifically about their super-large sodas. So, it's not about the Slurpees, but about their soda offerings.\n\nI recall that 7-Eleven does offer really big sodas, like way bigger than what you'd get in a regular restaurant or even most other convenience stores. They have these massive cups that can hold like a liter or more of soda. So, the question is, what do they call these big drinks?\n\nLet me think about this. I've heard the term \"Big Gulp\" before. I think it's associated with 7-Eleven. It sounds familiar, and I think it's their trademarked name for those large sodas. But I want to make sure I'm not confusing it with something else.\n\nOption A is \"Big Slurp.\" That sounds similar to \"Slurpee,\" which I know is their frozen drink brand. Maybe there's a connection there, but I think Slurpees are frozen drinks, and these are sodas, so maybe not.\n\nOption B is \"Big Gulp.\" This seems right. I've seen signs in 7-Eleven stores that say \"Big Gulp,\" and I think they're referring to their large sodas. Plus, the name \"Big Gulp\" makes sense because you're drinking a lot at once, like taking a big gulp of soda.\n\nOption C is \"Big Drink.\" That seems too generic. I don't recall 7-Eleven using that specific name for their large sodas. It might be a general term they use, but I don't think it's their trademarked name.\n\nOption D is \"Big Sip.\" That also sounds like it could be a possible name, but again, I don't remember 7-Eleven using that for their large sodas. It might be used by another company.\n\nSo, based on my knowledge, I think \"Big Gulp\" is the correct answer. It's trademarked by 7-Eleven for their super-large soda drinks. I remember that there was some controversy about them in New York City a few years back, where there was a proposal to ban large-sized sugary drinks, and 7-Eleven's Big Gulps were part of that discussion. That also reinforces that \"Big Gulp\" is their trademarked name.\n\nLet me double-check this. I can try to recall if I've ever seen any official 7-Eleven marketing materials that refer to their large sodas as anything else. I don't think so. The \"Big Gulp\" seems to be consistently used by them.\n\nAnother thing I recall is that the size of the Big Gulp can vary depending on the store, but typically they are very large, often 64 ounces or more. That's really big compared to a regular soda at a fast-food restaurant, which might be around 16 to 24 ounces.\n\nI also remember that 7-Eleven offers refills on Big Gulps for a discounted price, which might be another reason why they're popular. But that's more about the service than the name itself.\n\nSo, to sum it up, based on my recollections and the fact that \"Big Gulp\" is a recognized term associated with 7-Eleven's large soda drinks, I believe that option B. Big Gulp is the correct answer to the question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Big Gulp}} \\]"
