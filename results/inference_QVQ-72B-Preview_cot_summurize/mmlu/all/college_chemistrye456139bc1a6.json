                    "text": "So I have this problem here about calculating the spin angular momentum of 43Ca, and it says that the spin quantum number I is 7/2. I need to find out which of the given options is correct. The options are:\n\nA. 2.166 x 10^-34 J s\n\nB. 3.691 x 10^-34 J s\n\nC. 4.185 x 10^-34 J s\n\nD. 5.493 x 10^-34 J s\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for calculating the magnitude of angular momentum. I remember that the magnitude of angular momentum L is given by:\n\nL = \u221a(l(l+1)) * h-bar\n\nWhere l is the orbital quantum number, and h-bar is the reduced Planck's constant, which is h/(2\u03c0).\n\nBut in this problem, we're dealing with spin angular momentum, not orbital angular momentum. The formula for spin angular momentum should be similar:\n\nS = \u221a(s(s+1)) * h-bar\n\nWhere s is the spin quantum number.\n\nHere, the spin quantum number I is given as 7/2. So, s = 7/2.\n\nFirst, I need to plug in s = 7/2 into the formula:\n\nS = \u221a(7/2 * (7/2 + 1)) * h-bar\n\nLet me calculate the expression inside the square root:\n\n7/2 * (7/2 + 1) = 7/2 * (7/2 + 2/2) = 7/2 * (9/2) = 63/4\n\nSo,\n\nS = \u221a(63/4) * h-bar\n\nThe square root of 63/4 is the same as (\u221a63)/2.\n\n\u221a63 can be simplified to \u221a(9*7) = 3\u221a7.\n\nSo,\n\nS = (3\u221a7)/2 * h-bar\n\nNow, I need to find the numerical value of this expression. First, I need the value of h-bar, which is h/(2\u03c0).\n\nI know that h, the Planck's constant, is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J s.\n\nTherefore,\n\nh-bar = h/(2\u03c0) \u2248 (6.626 x 10^-34 J s)/(2\u03c0)\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n2\u03c0 \u2248 6.2832\n\nSo,\n\nh-bar \u2248 (6.626 x 10^-34)/6.2832 \u2248 1.054 x 10^-34 J s\n\nNow, plug this back into the expression for S:\n\nS \u2248 (3\u221a7)/2 * 1.054 x 10^-34 J s\n\nFirst, calculate \u221a7. I know that \u221a7 is approximately 2.64575.\n\nSo,\n\nS \u2248 (3 * 2.64575)/2 * 1.054 x 10^-34\n\nCalculate (3 * 2.64575):\n\n3 * 2.64575 = 7.93725\n\nThen, 7.93725 / 2 = 3.968625\n\nNow, multiply by h-bar:\n\nS \u2248 3.968625 * 1.054 x 10^-34 J s\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n3.968625 * 1.054 \u2248 4.185 J s\n\nAnd then multiply by 10^-34:\n\nS \u2248 4.185 x 10^-34 J s\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 4.185 x 10^-34 J s.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirm the formula for spin angular momentum:\n\nS = \u221a(s(s+1)) * h-bar\n\nWith s = 7/2,\n\nS = \u221a(7/2 * 9/2) * h-bar = \u221a(63/4) * h-bar = (\u221a63)/2 * h-bar\n\n\u221a63 \u2248 2.5198 (but earlier I used 2.64575, which seems more precise)\n\nWait, actually, \u221a7 is approximately 2.64575, but \u221a63 is closer to 7.9372 since 7.9^2 = 62.41 and 8^2 = 64.\n\nSo, \u221a63 \u2248 7.9372\n\nThen, S \u2248 (7.9372)/2 * h-bar \u2248 3.9686 * h-bar\n\nh-bar \u2248 1.054 x 10^-34 J s\n\nSo, S \u2248 3.9686 * 1.054 x 10^-34 \u2248 4.185 x 10^-34 J s\n\nYes, that matches option C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 4.185 x 10^-34 J s\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
