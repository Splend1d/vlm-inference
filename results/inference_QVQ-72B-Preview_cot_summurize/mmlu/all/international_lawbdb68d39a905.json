                    "text": "So I have this question about sovereign immunity, and I need to figure out what its purpose is. The options are:\n\nA. The purpose of immunity is to protect foreign Heads of State from embarrassment.\n\nB. Immunity protects a State from being invaded by another.\n\nC. Immunity shields States from being sued in the courts of other States.\n\nD. The purpose of immunity is to offer impunity in respect of all crimes.\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what sovereign immunity is. From what I recall, sovereign immunity is a legal concept that prevents a sovereign state from being sued in the courts of another state without its consent. So, it's about protecting states from being dragged into lawsuits in foreign courts without their agreement.\n\nOption C seems to align with that definition: \"Immunity shields States from being sued in the courts of other States.\" That sounds right.\n\nBut let's check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A says it's to protect foreign Heads of State from embarrassment. That doesn't sound right. While sovereign immunity might incidentally protect heads of state from some legal challenges, its primary purpose isn't to shield them from embarrassment. Embarrassment is too subjective and not a legal concept. So, this seems like a misunderstanding.\n\nOption B says immunity protects a state from being invaded by another. Invasion is a military action, and sovereign immunity is more about legal proceedings in courts. These seem like different domains. Sovereign immunity doesn't prevent one state from invading another; it's about civil lawsuits in domestic courts.\n\nOption D says the purpose is to offer impunity in respect of all crimes. Impunity means exemption from punishment or harm. Sovereign immunity doesn't grant states immunity from all crimes. It's specifically about civil lawsuits in foreign courts, not criminal proceedings or accountability for crimes.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option C seems to be the correct answer. It directly refers to the core principle of sovereign immunity, which is to shield states from being sued in the courts of other states without their consent.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should consider if there's any chance that another option could also be correct in some contexts. For example, sometimes sovereign immunity can extend to certain officials or actions related to state functions, but that's still within the broader framework of protecting the state from lawsuits in foreign courts.\n\nAlso, in international law, there are doctrines like state immunity and official immunity that relate to legal proceedings, but again, these are centered around preventing states from being subjected to the jurisdiction of foreign courts without their consent.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option C is the most accurate statement of the purpose of sovereign immunity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
