Granted women the right to vote\n\nB. Banned race-based discrimination\n\nC. Granted African-Americans the right to vote\n\nD. Suspended the use of literacy tests at voting centers\n\nHmm, I need to recall what the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was really about. I know that it was a significant piece of legislation during the Civil Rights Movement, and it was primarily aimed at eliminating racial discrimination in voting.\n\nFirst, let's consider option A: granting women the right to vote. I think that was actually achieved earlier, with the 19th Amendment in 1920. So, that seems like it might not be the correct answer.\n\nOption B: banned race-based discrimination. That sounds broad, but the Voting Rights Act was specifically about voting rights. There might be other laws that address race-based discrimination in general, like the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but I'm not sure if that's exactly what this question is getting at.\n\nOption C: granted African-Americans the right to vote. Well, technically, African Americans were supposed to have the right to vote already, based on the 15th Amendment passed in 1870, which says that the right to vote cannot be denied based on race. But in practice, many barriers prevented African Americans from voting, especially in the South. So, perhaps the Voting Rights Act was meant to enforce that existing right rather than grant a new one.\n\nOption D: suspended the use of literacy tests at voting centers. I remember learning that literacy tests were one of the methods used to disenfranchise African American voters, even if they were officially applied to everyone. These tests were often arbitrary and unfairly administered, making it difficult for many qualified voters to cast their ballots.\n\nWait a minute, I think the Voting Rights Act did include provisions that prohibited literacy tests and other similar devices that were used to discourage or prevent minorities from voting. So, option D seems relevant.\n\nBut, I also recall that the act had broader impacts beyond just suspending literacy tests. For example, it authorized federal oversight of voter registration in areas with a history of discriminatory practices, and it also provided for the appointment of federal examiners who could register voters.\n\nSo, maybe none of these options fully capture the scope of the Voting Rights Act. But since I have to choose one, I need to think about which one is most accurate.\n\nOption A is about women's suffrage, which happened earlier. Option B is too vague, as it just says \"banned race-based discrimination,\" but the act was specifically about voting discrimination. Option C suggests that the act granted the right to vote to African Americans, but as I thought before, they were already supposed to have that right under the 15th Amendment. So, perhaps it's more about ensuring and protecting that right rather than granting it anew.\n\nOption D mentions suspending the use of literacy tests at voting centers. While that was indeed a part of the act, it might not encompass all of its provisions. However, among the given choices, this seems like the most accurate statement related to the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nLet me double-check. I think the act did include provisions that prohibited literacy tests and other discriminatory practices used to prevent minorities from voting. So, yes, option D seems to align with that.\n\nI don't think the act granted women the right to vote, as that was already established. And while it did aim to eliminate race-based discrimination in voting, option B is too general, as it doesn't specify in what context\u2014whether in employment, housing, education, or voting.\n\nOption C implies that African Americans didn't have the right to vote before 1965, which isn't accurate because of the 15th Amendment. So, that might be misleading.\n\nTherefore, I believe the best answer is option D: suspended the use of literacy tests at voting centers. This directly refers to one of the key provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which was designed to remove barriers that had been used to suppress the votes of racial minorities.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
