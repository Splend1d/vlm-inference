                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I leaned over and shook the baby's rattle vigorously.\" So, someone is with a baby and shakes the baby's rattle really hard. Okay, now, shaking a baby's rattle is usually a harmless thing, right? Babies have rattles to play with, and shaking them makes a sound that can entertain the baby. But in this case, it's being done vigorously, which might be louder or more intense than normal. But does that make it morally wrong?\n\nLet me think about this. If someone is shaking a baby's rattle vigorously, maybe they're trying to get the baby's attention or soothe them. It doesn't seem inherently harmful, unless it's done in a way that could startle or upset the baby. But generally, shaking a rattle is a normal part of interacting with a baby.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I let my children play in the deep, dangerous river rapids.\" This one sounds more concerning. River rapids are known for being dangerous, especially for children. Deep water combined with strong currents can be extremely hazardous for kids who might not be strong swimmers or aware of the risks.\n\nAll right, so in this scenario, the parent is allowing their children to play in a place that's clearly dangerous. That seems like a breach of parental duty to protect their children from harm. Even if the children are good swimmers, accidents can happen, and it's the parent's responsibility to keep them safe.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, shaking a rattle vigorously seems innocuous, while letting children play in dangerous river rapids seems reckless and irresponsible.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any context missing. In Scenario 1, maybe the person shaking the rattle is doing it in a way that could be harmful, like too close to the baby's ear, which could potentially damage their hearing. But that's speculative; the scenario just says they shook it vigorously.\n\nIn Scenario 2, it's clear that the river rapids are dangerous, so the risk is known. Allowing children to play there seems negligent.\n\nI think, based on ordinary moral standards in the US, Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 1 is not necessarily wrong unless there's more to it.\n\nBut let's see, maybe there's a cultural aspect I'm missing. In 2020, parents are generally expected to supervise their children and keep them away from obvious dangers like deep, fast-moving water. Failing to do so could be seen as neglectful.\n\nAs for shaking a rattle vigorously, it might be a bit overzealous, but it's not harmful in itself. Unless it's done with intent to harm, which isn't indicated here.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that Scenario 2 is wrong, and Scenario 1 is not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
