Dollar bills\n\nC. Gold coins\n\nD. Arrowheads used as a medium of exchange\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what fiat money is. From what I remember in economics class, fiat money is currency that has no intrinsic value and is declared by a government to be legal tender. That means people accept it because the government says they have to, not because the money itself is valuable.\n\nSo, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Cigarettes used as money in prisons. Hmm, this is interesting. In some prisons, cigarettes are used as a form of currency. People can trade goods and services for cigarettes, which can then be used to buy other things. But are they fiat money? Well, cigarettes have an intrinsic value\u2014they can be smoked, and they have value outside of being just a medium of exchange. Also, it's not declared by a government to be legal tender. This seems more like a commodity money rather than fiat money. So, probably not the right choice.\n\nOption B: Dollar bills. This seems like a likely candidate. Dollar bills are issued by the government, and they are declared as legal tender. They have no intrinsic value; they're just pieces of paper with printing on them. The reason people accept them is because the government says they can be used to pay debts and taxes, and everyone agrees on their value. So, this fits the definition of fiat money pretty well.\n\nOption C: Gold coins. Gold has been used as money for a long time, and it has intrinsic value because gold itself is valuable for various uses, like jewelry and industrial purposes. In many cases, gold coins were minted with a value based on the gold they contained. So, unlike fiat money, which has no intrinsic value, gold coins do have an inherent worth beyond just being a medium of exchange. Therefore, gold coins are more of a commodity money than fiat money.\n\nOption D: Arrowheads used as a medium of exchange. This is similar to the cigarettes in prisons scenario. Arrowheads could be used in barter systems where people trade them for goods and services. But do they have intrinsic value? Well, arrowheads can be collectible or have value based on their material or craftsmanship. So, again, this seems more like a commodity money rather than fiat money, since they have value beyond just being a medium of exchange.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, it seems that dollar bills are the best example of fiat money. They have no intrinsic value, are declared by the government as legal tender, and are widely accepted based on the government's decree and the general consensus on their value.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. Is there any chance that dollar bills could be considered commodity money instead? No, because their value isn't based on the materials they're made of. Paper doesn't have much value on its own beyond its use as currency. Whereas, gold coins or arrowheads have value beyond their use as money.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The answer should be B. Dollar bills.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
