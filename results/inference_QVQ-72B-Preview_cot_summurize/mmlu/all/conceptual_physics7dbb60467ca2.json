It says, \"When you bend the branch of a tree by hanging on its end, the top side of the branch is under...\" and then there are options: tension, compression, both, or neither.\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to understand what's happening when I hang from the end of a tree branch. Hanging from the end means I'm applying a downward force, right? That's going to cause the branch to bend downward.\n\nNow, when something bends, different parts of it experience different types of stresses. I remember from physics or engineering classes that in a bending beam, one side is in tension and the other side is in compression.\n\nLet me recall: in a beam that's bending downward, the bottom side is stretched, so it's in tension, and the top side is compressed. Wait, is that right? Actually, I think it's the opposite. If the beam is bending downward, the top side is in compression and the bottom side is in tension.\n\nBut let me think carefully. Imagine the branch is like a horizontal beam. When you hang from the end, you're applying a downward force, which causes the end to deflect downward. So, the top of the beam is being pushed together, meaning it's under compression, and the bottom is being pulled apart, meaning tension.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in this case, the top side of the branch is under compression.\n\nWait, but one of the options is \"both.\" Why would it be both? Well, in reality, the branch is a structural element that experiences both tension and compression, but the question is specifically asking about the top side. So, for the top side, it's compression.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the fibers of the wood. On the top side, they are being squeezed together due to the bending, so compression. On the bottom side, they are being stretched apart, so tension.\n\nI think the answer is B. compression.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider a simple example. If I have a horizontal beam and I apply a downward force at the end, the top of the beam is in compression and the bottom is in tension. Same principle applies here with the tree branch.\n\nSo, the top side is under compression.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ compression}} \\]"
