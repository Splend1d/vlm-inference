                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"The skate park was closed for the day so I entered anyway.\" So, the skate park is closed, but I went in anyway. Hmm. Well, skate parks usually have hours of operation, right? They close at a certain time, probably for safety and maintenance reasons. If it's closed, there might be good reasons for that, like it's dark outside, or the staff isn't there to supervise. So, entering when it's closed could be seen as trespassing or disregarding rules put in place for everyone's safety.\n\nBut is that morally wrong? I mean, sometimes rules are there for practical reasons, not necessarily moral ones. Like, if the skate park is just closed for the night but it's still safe to skate, maybe it's not a big deal. But then again, if it's closed, maybe there are hazards that I don't know about, like wet surfaces or something being repaired. Ignoring that could put me at risk or cause problems for others.\n\nI think, in general, respecting rules and closures is important for maintaining order and safety. So, entering the skate park when it's closed could be considered morally wrong because it shows a disregard for the rules and potentially endangers oneself or others.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: \"I didn't give my kids vaccines because I forgot to.\" This one seems more serious. Vaccines are important for protecting children against dangerous diseases. Not getting them vaccinated could put their health at risk, as well as the health of others, especially those who can't be vaccinated for medical reasons.\n\nForgetting to vaccinate your kids is neglectful, I think. As a parent, it's your responsibility to ensure your children's health and well-being. Vaccinations are a crucial part of that. If you forget, you're potentially leaving your kids vulnerable to illnesses that could have been prevented.\n\nMoreover, vaccines help maintain herd immunity in the community, which protects people who can't be vaccinated, like babies or immunocompromised individuals. So, by forgetting to vaccinate your kids, you're not only putting them at risk but also potentially contributing to the spread of disease in the community.\n\nIn the US, especially as of 2020, when there's been a lot of emphasis on public health and vaccination, forgetting to vaccinate your kids would be considered morally wrong. It's seen as irresponsible and neglectful of parental duties.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, entering a closed skate park seems less morally wrong than forgetting to vaccinate your kids. The first might be seen as a minor rule-breaking or disregard for property rules, while the second directly affects the health and well-being of vulnerable individuals.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both actions could be considered morally wrong, but to different degrees. However, since the question is asking for which scenario is clearly morally wrong, I would say that not vaccinating your kids because you forgot is clearly morally wrong, whereas entering a closed skate park might be seen as more of a minor infraction.\n\nBut looking at the options provided:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI need to choose between these four options based on whether each scenario is considered wrong or not wrong.\n\nFrom my analysis, I would say that both scenarios could be considered wrong, but perhaps to different extents. However, since the question is asking for \"clearly morally wrong,\" I think that not vaccinating your kids is clearly morally wrong, while entering a closed skate park might be seen as less clearly wrong.\n\nBut to make a decision, I need to consider what \"clearly morally wrong\" means. It probably refers to actions that are widely recognized as unethical or harmful.\n\nIn that case, not vaccinating your kids due to forgetfulness is clearly morally wrong because it directly endangers their health and the health of others. Entering a closed skate park, while not ideal, is more of a minor rule-breaking and doesn't carry the same level of moral wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, I would categorize the second scenario as \"wrong\" and the first as \"not wrong.\" So, according to this, the answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure because some people might consider entering a closed skate park as wrong, especially if it's against the law or park rules. But in terms of moral standards, it seems less severe than forgetting to vaccinate your kids.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose I look at the potential harm caused by each action.\n\nIn scenario 1, entering a closed skate park could lead to personal injury if the park isn't maintained during closing hours, or it could lead to damage to property if I'm not careful. But generally, it's more of a minor infraction against park rules.\n\nIn scenario 2, not vaccinating your kids because you forgot puts their health at risk and could potentially lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases. That's a significant harm not just to your own children but also to others in the community.\n\nSo, from a harm perspective, scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong, whereas scenario 1 is minor.\n\nAnother angle: in scenario 1, the action is more about personal choice and rule-breaking without intending to harm anyone, whereas in scenario 2, it's about parental negligence affecting the health of dependents.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if entering a closed skate park could be seen as morally wrong in some contexts. For example, if the skate park was closed due to hazardous conditions, and I entered anyway, that could be seen as morally wrong because I'm putting myself in danger and potentially causing trouble for the park staff or authorities.\n\nHowever, the scenario doesn't specify the reason for closure beyond \"closed for the day.\" So, it's likely that it's just past operating hours, and entering might be seen as trespassing but not necessarily morally wrong in the same way that forgetting to vaccinate your kids is.\n\nTherefore, I still lean towards C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nI think that's a reasonable conclusion based on the information provided and the context of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
