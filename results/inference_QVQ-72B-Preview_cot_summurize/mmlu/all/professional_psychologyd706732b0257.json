He's got this research study involving junior high school students, and he's properly obtained informed consents from the parents and assents from the students. That all sounds good, following ethical research practices. But now, during the study, one of the students says they don't want to complete the interview. So, what should Dr. Jang do?\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. Tell the student that they cannot withdraw from the study because one of their parents has signed an informed consent.\n\nB. Tell the student that they cannot withdraw from the study because they agreed to participate at the beginning.\n\nC. Contact the student's parents to ask them to encourage their son to complete the interview.\n\nD. Allow the student to withdraw from the study.\n\nHmm, I need to think about research ethics here, especially regarding minors and their rights in research participation.\n\nFirst off, I know that in research involving children, both parental consent and the child's assent are important. Parental consent is necessary because children are minors and can't legally give consent themselves. But, children should also be involved in the decision-making process through assent, which respects their developing autonomy.\n\nNow, in this case, the parents have consented, and the students have assented. But now, during the study, the student wants to withdraw. What does that mean in terms of their rights?\n\nI think it's important to remember that participants have the right to withdraw from a study at any time, without any penalty. This is a basic principle in research ethics, ensuring that participation is voluntary.\n\nBut, since the participant is a minor, does that change things? I don't think so. Even though parents have consented, the child's wishes should still be respected, especially since they were involved through the assent process.\n\nSo, option D seems straightforward: allow the student to withdraw from the study. That aligns with the principle of voluntary participation.\n\nBut let's consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A suggests telling the student they can't withdraw because a parent consented. That doesn't seem right. Just because a parent consented doesn't mean the child loses the right to change their mind. In fact, it's ethically problematic to force a child to participate against their will, as that could cause distress or harm.\n\nOption B says the student can't withdraw because they agreed to participate. Again, this seems to go against the principle that participation should remain voluntary throughout the study. Participants should feel free to withdraw at any time if they feel uncomfortable or no longer wish to be involved.\n\nOption C proposes that Dr. Jang should contact the parents to encourage the student to complete the interview. This also seems inappropriate because it puts pressure on the student to participate against their wishes. It could be seen as coercive, which is against ethical research practices.\n\nTherefore, the most ethical choice is option D: allow the student to withdraw from the study.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's more to consider. Is there any possibility that allowing the student to withdraw could have negative consequences, like compromising the integrity of the data or something?\n\nWell, research designs often account for participant dropout, so it's usually manageable. Plus, prioritizing the well-being and autonomy of the participant should come before data considerations.\n\nAlso, in the context of interviewing, if a student doesn't want to continue, pushing them might make the data collected unreliable anyway, as they might not be fully engaged or honest in their responses.\n\nSo, from both an ethical and a methodological standpoint, allowing withdrawal seems like the best course of action.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the potential reasons why the student might want to withdraw. Maybe they're feeling uncomfortable with the topic, or perhaps they're just not in the mood that day. Regardless of the reason, respecting their decision reinforces the voluntary nature of the research and builds trust.\n\nMoreover, in research with minors, it's especially important to create an environment where they feel safe to say no or to change their minds without fear of repercussions.\n\nSo, in conclusion, Dr. Jang should allow the student to withdraw from the study.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
