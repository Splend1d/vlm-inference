                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about the system of checks and balances in the U.S. government. The question is asking which statement is NOT true under this system. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that the president's nominees must be approved by the Senate before taking office. I know that for many positions, like Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices, the president nominates someone, but then the Senate has to confirm that nomination. So, that sounds like it's part of the checks and balances system. Maybe this is true.\n\nOption B states that two-thirds of the Senate must approve presidentially negotiated treaties. I recall that the president negotiates treaties, but they have to be ratified by the Senate with a two-thirds majority. That seems right too. So, probably true.\n\nOption C says that the president can override a congressional veto and pass laws. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this one. I know that Congress passes laws, and the president can veto them. But if Congress disagrees with the president's veto, they can override it with a two-thirds majority vote in both houses. So, in that case, Congress can override the president's veto, not the other way around. Does that mean that the president can't override a congressional veto? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms.\n\nLet me think again. When Congress passes a law, the president can sign it into law or veto it. If the president vetoes it, Congress can try to override the veto with a two-thirds majority in both houses. If they succeed, the law passes anyway, without the president's approval. But the president can't override Congress's decision to override the veto. So, perhaps the statement is incorrect because the president can't override a congressional veto; instead, Congress can override a presidential veto.\n\nOption D says that Congress can override a presidential veto. As I just thought, yes, that's correct. If the president vetoes a bill, Congress can override the veto with a two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems to be the one that's not true under the system of checks and balances. The president can't override a congressional veto to pass laws; instead, Congress can override the president's veto.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Is there such a thing as a congressional veto? Actually, I think the term \"congressional veto\" refers to a provision in a statute that allows Congress to disapprove an executive action by passing a resolution. But in terms of law-making, it's more about Congress passing bills and the president vetoing them, and then Congress potentially overriding the veto.\n\nSo, in that context, the president doesn't have the power to override Congress's decision to pass a law, especially if they've overridden his veto. Therefore, the president cannot override a congressional veto because that's not how the process works.\n\nI think the key here is understanding the relationship between the legislative and executive branches in the law-making process. The president has the power to veto bills, but Congress can override that veto with sufficient votes. The president doesn't have the authority to override Congress's actions in this context.\n\nTherefore, option C is not true under the system of checks and balances.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
