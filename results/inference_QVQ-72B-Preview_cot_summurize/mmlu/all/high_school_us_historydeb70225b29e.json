                    "text": "So I've got this question here about William Lloyd Garrison's argument in a passage from The Liberator in 1831, and it's asking which Supreme Court decision later contradicted his views. The options are Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857), Ex parte Milligan (1866), Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), and Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954). Hmm, I need to recall what each of these cases was about and see which one disagrees with Garrison's stance.\n\nFirst, let's understand Garrison's argument. He's saying that free colored persons born and naturalized in the country should be considered American citizens and entitled to all the rights, privileges, and immunities of citizens in the states. He also mentions that the Constitution shouldn't make any discriminatory distinctions based on color or condition of free inhabitants. So, essentially, he's advocating for equal rights and citizenship for free black people.\n\nNow, let's look at each of these Supreme Court decisions to see which one contradicts this view.\n\nStarting with Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857). I remember that this case decided that African Americans, whether enslaved or free, were not considered citizens of the United States and therefore could not sue in federal court. The Court also said that the federal government couldn't prohibit slavery in the territories. This seems directly contradictory to Garrison's argument, which\u4e3b\u5f20 that free black people should be recognized as citizens with equal rights.\n\nNext, Ex parte Milligan (1866). This case was about the legality of military tribunals trying a civilian during wartime. It's more about the jurisdiction of military courts versus civilian courts and the suspension of habeas corpus. It doesn't directly deal with the citizenship or rights of free black people, so it probably isn't the one that contradicts Garrison's argument.\n\nThen there's Plessy v. Ferguson (1896). This case upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation laws, establishing the \"separate but equal\" doctrine. It allowed states to segregate public facilities as long as they provided equal amenities for both races. However, in practice, this often led to vastly unequal treatment and facilities for black people. This seems to go against Garrison's idea of equal rights and privileges, but it's important to note that Plessy was about segregation, not about whether free black people were citizens.\n\nLastly, Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954). This landmark case overturned Plessy v. Ferguson, declaring that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional because it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This decision affirmed that separate educational facilities were inherently unequal, thus supporting the idea of equal rights for all, including black Americans. This seems to align more with Garrison's views rather than contradicting them.\n\nSo, comparing these options to Garrison's argument, Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857) directly contradicts his assertion that free black people should be considered citizens with equal rights. Ex parte Milligan deals with a different aspect of legal proceedings and doesn't touch on citizenship or equal rights for black people. Plessy v. Ferguson upholds segregation but doesn't directly address citizenship status. Brown v. Board of Education supports equal treatment and rights, which aligns with Garrison's views.\n\nTherefore, the Supreme Court decision that most directly contradicts William Lloyd Garrison's argument is Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857), because it denied citizenship to African Americans, both enslaved and free, which is the exact opposite of what Garrison was advocating.\n\nI think the answer is A. Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857)."
