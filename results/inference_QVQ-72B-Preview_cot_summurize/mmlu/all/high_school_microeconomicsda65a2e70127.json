Higher risk job.\n\nB. Investment in human capital.\n\nC. Increase in production of SUVs.\n\nD. Racial discrimination.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a wage differential is. From what I recall, a wage differential refers to the difference in wages between different jobs or workers. These differences can be due to various factors like education, experience, skill levels, working conditions, and sometimes discrimination.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Higher risk job.\n\nI would think that jobs with higher risk would pay more because they require taking on more danger or uncertainty. For example, a miner might earn more than an office worker because of the hazardous working conditions. So, this seems like a legitimate basis for a wage differential.\n\nOption B: Investment in human capital.\n\nHuman capital refers to the skills and knowledge that a person has, which can increase their productivity. Investing in human capital, like getting more education or training, often leads to higher-paying jobs. So, this also seems like a valid reason for wage differences.\n\nOption C: Increase in production of SUVs.\n\nThis one seems a bit odd. An increase in the production of SUVs might affect the demand for certain workers, like assembly line workers in the automotive industry, but it's not directly a basis for a wage differential. Maybe it could indirectly lead to higher wages if there's increased demand for those workers, but it's not a direct reason for wage differentials between different jobs or workers.\n\nOption D: Racial discrimination.\n\nDiscrimination based on race is unfortunately a reality in many societies, including the workforce. It's when someone is paid less because of their race, not because of differences in skill, experience, or job requirements. This is unfair and illegal in many places, but it can still happen. So, while it can cause wage differentials, it's not a legitimate basis for them.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of these is not a basis for a wage differential. Given that racial discrimination is not a justifiable reason for wage differences, I think D is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe the question is trying to trick me by including an option that's not directly related to wage determination.\n\nWait, perhaps the increase in production of SUVs is also not a direct basis for wage differentials. It might affect the demand for labor, but it's not a reason why one job should pay more than another.\n\nBut comparing it to discrimination, which is a clear-cut case of unfair wage differential, I still think that discrimination is not a legitimate basis for wage differentials.\n\nSo, my final answer would be D. Racial discrimination.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
