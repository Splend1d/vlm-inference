                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which writer was concerned with the reaction of workers to key characteristics of bureaucracies. The options are Merton, Weber, Gouldner, and Mayo. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what a bureaucracy is. I think of it as a formal system of organization and administration, often characterized by a hierarchy of authority, standardized rules and procedures, and impersonality. Bureaucracies are common in large organizations, like governments and corporations.\n\nNow, the question is about how workers react to these key characteristics\u2014hierarchy, rules, impersonality, etc. So, I need to find out which of these writers focused on that aspect.\n\nLet me start by recalling what each writer is known for.\n\nBeginning with Weber: I know that Max Weber was a German sociologist who is often credited with founding modern sociological thought. He wrote about bureaucracy, emphasizing its efficiency and rationality. He described an ideal type of bureaucracy that has a clear hierarchy, written rules, and impersonal relationships. But did he specifically focus on how workers react to these features? Maybe not directly; his focus seemed to be more on the structure and efficiency of bureaucracies rather than on the experiences or reactions of the people working within them.\n\nNext, Mayo: I believe he was involved in the Hawthorne studies, which looked at how workers' productivity was affected by their working conditions and social environments. The Hawthorne effect is named after these studies, suggesting that workers' performance improves simply because they feel valued and observed. So, Mayo was more about understanding worker motivation and the impact of social factors in the workplace. While that's related to organizations, it's not directly about their reaction to bureaucratic characteristics like hierarchy and rules.\n\nThen there's Merton: Robert K. Merton was a prominent sociologist who contributed to several areas, including bureaucracy. He introduced the concept of \"bureaucratic personality,\" which describes how individuals in bureaucracies might conform to the norms and rules of the organization, sometimes to the point where they lose their individuality or critical thinking. This sounds like he was looking at how workers react to and are shaped by bureaucratic environments. That seems relevant to the question.\n\nLastly, Gouldner: I'm less familiar with Albert Gouldner's work, but I recall that he wrote about bureaucracy and the professional-managerial class. He discussed how professionals in bureaucracies might experience conflicting loyalties between their professional ethics and the demands of the organization. This also touches on how workers respond to bureaucratic structures and expectations.\n\nSo, comparing these options:\n\n- Weber focused on the structure and ideal type of bureaucracy.\n\n- Mayo looked at worker motivation and social factors in the workplace.\n\n- Merton explored how bureaucracy shapes individual personalities and behaviors.\n\n- Gouldner examined the experiences of professionals in bureaucracies and the potential for conflicting loyalties.\n\nThe question is specifically about workers' reactions to key characteristics of bureaucracies, such as hierarchy and rules. Both Merton and Gouldner seem to address this, but Merton's concept of the \"bureaucratic personality\" directly links to how workers adapt to and are influenced by bureaucratic norms and rules.\n\nGouldner, on the other hand, seems to focus more on professionals and the tensions they face within bureaucracies, which is a specific subset of workers.\n\nGiven that, I think Merton is the writer who was most concerned with the general reaction of workers to the key characteristics of bureaucracies.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing about Gouldner's work.\n\nGouldner wrote about the \"Professional-Managerial Class\" and discussed how these workers might experience alienation due to the contradictory nature of their positions\u2014being both professionals with certain autonomy and managers within a bureaucratic structure. So, again, this is more specific to professionals and managers rather than workers in general.\n\nMerton's work on the bureaucratic personality, however, is more broadly applicable to workers at various levels within a bureaucracy.\n\nAdditionally, Merton discussed the concept of \"latent functions\" and \"manifest functions\" in his functionalist approach, which could relate to how bureaucracies operate and how individuals within them behave.\n\nWait, but the question isn't about functions; it's about workers' reactions to bureaucracy's characteristics.\n\nI think Merton's focus on how individuals conform to bureaucratic norms and rules aligns closely with the concept of workers' reactions to these structures.\n\nSo, my final answer is A. Merton.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Merton}} \\]"
