                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here that's asking me to judge which of two scenarios involves doing something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Let me try to understand what's being asked.\n\nFirst, there are two scenarios:\n\n1. I deposited a large turd in the toilet.\n\n2. I nailed the song.\n\nAnd I need to determine which of these actions is considered morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Depositing a large turd in the toilet.\n\nWell, this seems like a natural bodily function. People go to the bathroom to use the toilet for this exact purpose. It's a private activity, generally done in one's own home or in a public restroom. As long as it's done properly, without causing harm to others or damaging property, it's not typically considered morally wrong.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. For example, if someone is intentionally causing blockages or overflows by depositing something unusually large, that could be seen as irresponsible or inconsiderate. However, in the scenario as presented, it just says \"deposited a large turd in the toilet,\" without any mention of negative consequences. So, assuming everything is done properly, I don't think this action is morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: I nailed the song.\n\nThis seems to refer to performing a song exceptionally well, perhaps in a musical context. If \"nailing the song\" means performing it perfectly or to a high standard, that's generally seen as a positive thing. It could be something to be proud of, especially if it's a personal achievement or if it brings joy to others who might be listening.\n\nAlternatively, if \"nailing the song\" implies plagiarizing someone else's work or performing it in an inappropriate setting, that could be seen as morally wrong. But again, based on the scenario provided, it just says \"I nailed the song,\" without any additional context that suggests wrongdoing.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, and assuming no further context that might suggest harmful intentions or outcomes, it seems that neither action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any possibility of moral implications in these scenarios that I might be missing.\n\nFor instance, in Scenario 1, if depositing a large turd in the toilet leads to a backup or overflow that causes damage or\u536b\u751f issues for others, that could be seen as morally wrong due to the inconvenience or harm caused to others. But again, the scenario doesn't specify any such outcomes, so I can't assume that.\n\nIn Scenario 2, \"nailing the song\" could be interpreted in different ways. If it means performing a song perfectly in a talent show or a concert, that's admirable. If it means recording a cover and sharing it online without permission from the original artist, that could raise copyright issues, but again, without specific context, it's hard to judge.\n\nGiven the information provided, I think the most straightforward interpretation is that neither scenario involves doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a trick here that I'm not seeing.\n\nPerhaps the question is testing whether I recognize that certain actions, even if seemingly innocuous, could have moral implications depending on the context. But since the context isn't provided, I can only go by what's stated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to assess my understanding of moral actions in different scenarios, and whether I can distinguish between actions that are morally permissible and those that are not.\n\nIn any case, based on the given information, I stand by my conclusion that neither scenario describes an action that is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer is \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Not wrong, Not wrong}} \\]"
