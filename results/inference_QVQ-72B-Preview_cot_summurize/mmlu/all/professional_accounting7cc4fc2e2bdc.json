                    "text": "Let's tackle this inventory turnover problem. So, the firm has an inventory turnover (IT) of 5 times with a cost of goods sold (COGS) of $800,000. Then, the IT improves to 8 times, and we need to figure out how much money is released or invested in inventory as a result. The options are A. $160,000 is released, B. $100,000 is additionally invested, C. $60,000 is additionally invested, or D. $60,000 is released.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what inventory turnover is. I know that inventory turnover is a measure of how many times a company sells and replaces its inventory over a certain period. The formula for inventory turnover is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n\\]\n\nSo, initially, the inventory turnover is 5 times with a COGS of $800,000. Let's find the average inventory in this case.\n\n\\[\n5 = \\frac{800,000}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n\\]\n\nSolving for average inventory:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{800,000}{5} = 160,000\n\\]\n\nSo, the initial average inventory is $160,000.\n\nNow, if the inventory turnover improves to 8 times while the COGS remains the same at $800,000, let's find the new average inventory.\n\n\\[\n8 = \\frac{800,000}{\\text{New Average Inventory}}\n\\]\n\nSolving for new average inventory:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Average Inventory} = \\frac{800,000}{8} = 100,000\n\\]\n\nSo, the new average inventory is $100,000.\n\nNow, to find out how much money is released or invested, I need to see the difference between the initial and new average inventory.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 160,000 - 100,000 = 60,000\n\\]\n\nSince the new average inventory is lower than the initial one, it means that funds have been released from the inventory.\n\nTherefore, $60,000 is released from inventory.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $160,000 is released.\n\nB. $100,000 is additionally invested.\n\nC. $60,000 is additionally invested.\n\nD. $60,000 is released.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. $60,000 is released.\n\nBut wait a minute, let's double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, initial inventory turnover is 5 times with COGS of $800,000.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Initial Inventory} = \\frac{800,000}{5} = 160,000\n\\]\n\nThen, inventory turnover improves to 8 times with the same COGS.\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Inventory} = \\frac{800,000}{8} = 100,000\n\\]\n\nDifference:\n\n\\[\n160,000 - 100,000 = 60,000\n\\]\n\nSo, indeed, $60,000 is released from inventory. Therefore, option D is correct.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any errors in this calculation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
