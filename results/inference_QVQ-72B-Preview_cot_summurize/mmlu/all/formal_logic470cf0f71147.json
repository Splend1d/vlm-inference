                    "text": "Let's tackle this logic problem. So, the statement is \"Some CEO is wealthier than everyone.\" And we have to translate this into predicate logic from the given options. The symbols are:\n\n- Cx: x is a CEO\n\n- Px: x is a person\n\n- Wxy: x is wealthier than y\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the statement is saying. It says that there exists at least one CEO who is wealthier than every person. So, it's talking about the existence of at least one CEO with a certain property: being wealthier than all persons.\n\nLet's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A: (\u2203x)[Cx \u2022 (\u2200y)(Py \u2022 Wxy)]\n\nThis says that there exists an x such that x is a CEO, and for all y, if y is a person then x is wealthier than y. Wait, but the dot (\u2022) is conjunction, so it's saying that x is a CEO AND for all y, if y is a person then x is wealthier than y. Hmm, that seems close to what we want.\n\nOption B: (\u2203x)[Cx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Py \u2283 Wxy)]\n\nHere, the implication symbol (\u2283) is used between Cx and the rest. So, it's saying that if x is a CEO, then for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y. This seems similar to option A, but with an implication instead of conjunction.\n\nOption C: (\u2203x)[Cx \u2022 (\u2200y)(Py \u2283 Wxy)]\n\nThis is similar to option A, but the implication is inside the universal quantifier. It says that there exists an x that is a CEO AND for all y, if y is a person then x is wealthier than y. This seems very similar to what we want.\n\nOption D: (\u2200x)[Px \u2283 (\u2203y)(Cy \u2283 Wxy)]\n\nThis one looks different. It says that for all x, if x is a person, then there exists some y such that if y is a CEO, then x is wealthier than y. That seems convoluted and not directly related to the original statement.\n\nSo, between options A, B, and C, which one is the best translation?\n\nLet's rephrase the original statement: \"Some CEO is wealthier than everyone.\"\n\nIn logical terms, this means:\n\nThere exists an x such that x is a CEO, and for all y, x is wealthier than y, provided that y is a person.\n\nSo, in logical notation, this would be:\n\n(\u2203x)(Cx \u2022 (\u2200y)(Py \u2283 Wxy))\n\nWait, that looks like option C.\n\nBut let's double-check option A and B.\n\nOption A: (\u2203x)[Cx \u2022 (\u2200y)(Py \u2022 Wxy)]\n\nThis seems to say that for all y, if y is a person AND x is wealthier than y. But hold on, in logic, conjunction has both parts needing to be true. So, this would require that for all y, y is a person AND x is wealthier than y. But this seems off because it's suggesting that all y are persons and x is wealthier than them, which isn't necessarily true. The original statement only says that the CEO is wealthier than everyone, not that everyone is a person.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nOption B: (\u2203x)[Cx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Py \u2283 Wxy)]\n\nThis says that if x is a CEO, then for all y, if y is a person then x is wealthier than y. This seems to capture the essence of the statement: there exists at least one CEO such that it's wealthier than every person.\n\nOption C: (\u2203x)[Cx \u2022 (\u2200y)(Py \u2283 Wxy)]\n\nThis says that there exists an x that is a CEO AND for all y, if y is a person then x is wealthier than y. This is similar to option B but with the implication inside the universal quantifier.\n\nI think both options B and C are capturing the same meaning. But let's see which one is more accurate.\n\nActually, option B uses implication between Cx and the rest, while option C uses conjunction between Cx and the universal quantifier.\n\nI think option C is more precise because it explicitly states that x is a CEO AND for all y, if y is a person then x is wealthier than y.\n\nOption B is also correct logically, but perhaps option C is clearer in meaning.\n\nWait, but in logic, the scope of quantifiers and connectives is crucial.\n\nLet me consider the logical equivalence.\n\nOption C: (\u2203x)[Cx \u2022 (\u2200y)(Py \u2283 Wxy)]\n\nThis means there exists an x that is a CEO AND for all y, if y is a person then x is wealthier than y.\n\nThis seems to capture the meaning perfectly: there is at least one CEO who is wealthier than every person.\n\nOption B: (\u2203x)[Cx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Py \u2283 Wxy)]\n\nThis says that there exists an x such that if x is a CEO, then for all y, if y is a person then x is wealthier than y.\n\nThis is also correct, but it's using implication instead of conjunction.\n\nIn this case, since the existential quantifier is outside, the implication doesn't affect the universal quantifier directly.\n\nBut to be safe, I think option C is clearer and more accurate.\n\nOption A: (\u2203x)[Cx \u2022 (\u2200y)(Py \u2022 Wxy)]\n\nThis seems problematic because it requires that for all y, y is a person AND x is wealthier than y. This would only be true if all y are persons, which is not necessarily the case. So, this option is not correct.\n\nTherefore, between the given options, C seems to be the best translation.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there are any domain restrictions or other considerations.\n\nIf the domain is all persons, then perhaps option A could be considered, but that's not specified here.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options provided, I believe option C is the correct translation into predicate logic for the statement \"Some CEO is wealthier than everyone.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
