                    "text": "Alright, let's tackle this question. There are four options, and I need to figure out which one is true. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nOption A says that the velocity of money is equal to real GDP divided by the money supply. Hmm, I think I remember something about the velocity of money, but I'm a bit fuzzy. Let me recall: The velocity of money is basically how fast money circulates in the economy. There's a formula for that, right? I think it's related to nominal GDP divided by the money supply. But here it says real GDP divided by the money supply. Wait, is there a difference between nominal and real GDP? Yes, nominal GDP is measured at current prices, and real GDP is adjusted for inflation. So, using real GDP would adjust for inflationary effects. But in the context of velocity, I think nominal GDP is more commonly used. Maybe I need to double-check that.\n\nOption B says that dollars earned today have more purchasing power than dollars earned a year from today. That sounds familiar. It's related to the time value of money, right? Because of inflation, the purchasing power of money tends to decrease over time. So, a dollar today can buy more than a dollar in the future because of inflation eroding its value. Yeah, that seems to make sense.\n\nOption C says that the supply of loanable funds consists of investors. Hmm, I thought the supply of loanable funds comes from savers, not investors. Savers are people who put their money into banks or other financial institutions, and investors are the ones who use that money to invest in businesses or other ventures. So, would investors be the supply? Wait, maybe I have it backwards. Let me think again. The supply of loanable funds is the amount of money that savers are willing to lend, and the demand comes from borrowers or investors who want to borrow that money. So, in that case, savers are the supply, and investors are the demand. So, this option seems to be saying the opposite.\n\nOption D says that the demand for loanable funds consists of savers. Again, based on what I just thought, savers are the supply, and investors are the demand. So, if that's the case, then this option is also incorrect because it's attributing the demand to savers instead of investors.\n\nSo, let's summarize:\n\n- Option A: Velocity of money is real GDP divided by money supply. But I think it's usually nominal GDP divided by money supply. So, maybe not correct.\n\n- Option B: Dollars today have more purchasing power than dollars a year from now. That makes sense due to inflation.\n\n- Option C: Supply of loanable funds is investors. I think savers are the supply.\n\n- Option D: Demand for loanable funds is savers. No, I think it's investors.\n\nSo, among these, Option B seems to be the correct one.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check the velocity of money formula. Let's see, the formula for velocity of money is V = Nominal GDP / Money Supply. Yes, that's what I recall. So, Option A is using real GDP instead of nominal GDP, which might not be accurate. Because real GDP is adjusted for inflation, using it in this context might give a different measure. So, probably Option A is incorrect due to that.\n\nAlso, for the loanable funds market, the supply is indeed from savers, and the demand is from investors. So, Options C and D are incorrect as they misattribute the supply and demand.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option B.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any scenario where Option A could be correct. Maybe in some contexts, using real GDP makes sense, but in standard macroeconomics, it's nominal GDP divided by money supply. So, unless specified otherwise, I'd stick with that.\n\nOption B is straightforward and aligns with the concept of inflation and the time value of money.\n\nSo, my final answer is Option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
