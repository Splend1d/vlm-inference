                    "text": "Let's see here. I'm trying to figure out what the pedestrian's legal status was when he was in the restroom of this private dinner club. The options are trespasser, guest, licensee, or invitee. Hmm, I need to understand the differences between these terms.\n\nFirst off, a trespasser is someone who enters property without permission, right? But in this case, the pedestrian saw a sign that said \"Admittance to Members Only,\" and he wasn't a member, but he still went in. So, did he have permission? It seems like he didn't, because the sign clearly says only members can enter. So, maybe he's a trespasser.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe there are different types of permissions or something. Let's think about guests. A guest is someone who is invited or permitted to enter, right? But again, he wasn't a member, and the sign says members only, so he probably wasn't a guest.\n\nWhat about a licensee? I think a licensee is someone who has permission to enter for some purpose, like a delivery person or something. But again, he wasn't a member, and he didn't have any specific permission to enter beyond just walking in because he needed to use the restroom. So, maybe not a licensee.\n\nThen there's an invitee, which I think is similar to a customer in a store or someone who's invited for business reasons. But again, he wasn't a member, and he wasn't there for business; he just needed to use the restroom.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the fact that he saw the sign and still entered makes a difference. The sign says \"Admittance to Members Only,\" which is like a general invitation to members, but not to non-members. So, by entering despite not being a member, he's ignoring the restriction on entry.\n\nMaybe I should look at it from the club's perspective. The club has a policy that only members can enter, as indicated by the sign. So, anyone who enters without being a member is doing so without permission. Therefore, he's a trespasser.\n\nBut, I've heard that in some cases, if a property is open to the public, or if there's an implied invitation, then someone who enters might have a different status. For example, stores often have open doors, and customers are invited to come in and shop, making them invitees.\n\nIn this case, though, the club is private and explicitly states \"members only,\" so it's not open to the general public. Therefore, the pedestrian, not being a member, entered without permission, which would make him a trespasser.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor that could change this. Suppose the pedestrian asked someone inside for permission to use the restroom, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just says he entered and used the restroom.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like the best answer is trespasser.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. In law, a trespasser is someone who enters or remains on property without any right or permission to do so. Here, the pedestrian wasn't a member, and the sign clearly indicates that only members can enter, so he didn't have the right or permission to enter. Therefore, he's a trespasser.\n\nI don't think it matters that he was just using the restroom; he still entered without permission. So, I'm confident that A. Trespasser is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Trespasser.}} \\]"
