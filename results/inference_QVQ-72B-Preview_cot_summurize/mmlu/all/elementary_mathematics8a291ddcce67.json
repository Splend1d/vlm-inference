                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem: 942 divided by 3. I need to find the exact answer, and there are options provided: A. 214, B. 304, C. 314, D. 642. Hmm, I should make sure I get the right one.\n\nFirst, I know that division is just splitting a number into equal parts. So, 942 divided by 3 means I'm splitting 942 into 3 equal parts, and I need to find out how much is in each part.\n\nI remember there are different ways to approach division. One way is to use long division, which I think will work best here.\n\nLet's set up the long division:\n\n```\n\n942 \u00f7 3 =\n\n```\n\nNow, I start from the leftmost digit. The first digit is 9. I ask myself, how many times does 3 go into 9? Well, 3 times 3 is 9, right? So, I write 3 above the line, over the 9.\n\nSubtract 9 from 9, and I get 0. So, no remainder there.\n\nNext, I bring down the next digit, which is 4. Now, I have 04. Wait, no, actually, since I've already subtracted, it's just bringing down the 4 to make it 4.\n\nNow, how many times does 3 go into 4? 3 times 1 is 3, which is less than 4, and 3 times 2 is 6, which is more than 4. So, 3 goes into 4 once.\n\nI write 1 above the line, over the 4.\n\nThen, I multiply 3 by 1, which is 3, and subtract that from 4, leaving me with 1.\n\nNow, I bring down the next digit, which is 2, to make it 12.\n\nHow many times does 3 go into 12? That's easy\u20143 times 4 is 12.\n\nI write 4 above the line, over the 2.\n\nMultiply 3 by 4, which is 12, and subtract that from 12, leaving 0.\n\nSo, the division is exact, and there are no remainders.\n\nPutting it all together, the quotient is 314.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 214\n\nB. 304\n\nC. 314\n\nD. 642\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 314.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I can use another method to confirm.\n\nAnother way to divide is to break the number into parts that are easier to handle.\n\nFor example, 942 can be thought of as 900 + 42.\n\nFirst, divide 900 by 3. 900 divided by 3 is 300.\n\nThen, divide 42 by 3. 42 divided by 3 is 14.\n\nNow, add those together: 300 + 14 = 314.\n\nAgain, I get the same answer, 314.\n\nAlternatively, I could use multiplication to check, since division and multiplication are inverse operations.\n\nSo, if 942 \u00f7 3 = 314, then 3 \u00d7 314 should equal 942.\n\nLet's do that: 3 \u00d7 300 = 900, and 3 \u00d7 14 = 42. Adding them up, 900 + 42 = 942.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any other approach or if I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me think about the options again:\n\nA. 214\n\nB. 304\n\nC. 314\n\nD. 642\n\nIf I had to choose among these, 314 seems the most plausible based on my calculations.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if I might have miscalculated somewhere.\n\nIn the long division method, I had:\n\n- 9 \u00f7 3 = 3\n\n- 4 \u00f7 3 = 1 remainder 1\n\n- 12 \u00f7 3 = 4\n\n- So, 314\n\nIn the breakdown method:\n\n- 900 \u00f7 3 = 300\n\n- 42 \u00f7 3 = 14\n\n- Total: 314\n\nAnd the multiplication check:\n\n- 3 \u00d7 314 = 942\n\nAll these methods confirm that 314 is the correct answer.\n\nI don't see any error in my reasoning, so I believe the correct answer is C. 314.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ 314} \\]"
