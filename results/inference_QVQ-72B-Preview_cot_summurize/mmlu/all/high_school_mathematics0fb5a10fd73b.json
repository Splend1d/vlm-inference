                    "text": "So I have this problem here: I need to find all positive values of \\( c \\) such that the inequality \\( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \\) has real solutions for \\( x \\). And I need to express my answer in interval notation. The options provided are (0, 9), (1, 1), (6, 0), and (6, 6).\n\nAlright, first things first. I need to understand what it means for the inequality \\( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \\) to have real solutions. This is a quadratic inequality, and the corresponding equation is \\( x^2 - 6x + c = 0 \\). The solutions to this equation are the points where the quadratic function intersects the x-axis.\n\nFor the quadratic inequality \\( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \\) to have real solutions, the quadratic function must cross the x-axis at some points, meaning that the equation \\( x^2 - 6x + c = 0 \\) must have real roots.\n\nI recall that for a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the nature of the roots is determined by the discriminant, which is \\( d = b^2 - 4ac \\). If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots; if it's zero, there's exactly one real root (a repeated root); and if it's negative, there are no real roots (complex roots instead).\n\nIn this case, since we want the inequality \\( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \\) to have real solutions, the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 6x + c = 0 \\) must have real roots. Therefore, the discriminant must be greater than or equal to zero.\n\nSo, let's calculate the discriminant for the quadratic equation:\n\n\\( d = (-6)^2 - 4(1)(c) = 36 - 4c \\)\n\nWe set the discriminant to be greater than or equal to zero:\n\n\\( 36 - 4c \\geq 0 \\)\n\nNow, solve for \\( c \\):\n\n\\( 36 \\geq 4c \\)\n\n\\( c \\leq 9 \\)\n\nSo, \\( c \\) must be less than or equal to 9 for the quadratic equation to have real roots, which means the inequality \\( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \\) can have real solutions.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that \\( c \\) must be positive, so \\( c > 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, combining these two conditions, \\( c \\) must be in the interval \\( (0, 9] \\).\n\nBut wait, let's think about this again. The problem says \"has real solutions for \\( x \\)\", and it's an inequality, not just the equation.\n\nLet me consider the graph of \\( y = x^2 - 6x + c \\). This is a upward-opening parabola because the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is positive.\n\nFor the inequality \\( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \\) to have real solutions, the parabola must cross the x-axis at some points, meaning that the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 6x + c = 0 \\) must have real roots. So, again, the discriminant must be greater than or equal to zero.\n\nWait, but actually, if the discriminant is exactly zero, the quadratic touches the x-axis at exactly one point, which means the inequality \\( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \\) would only be satisfied at that single point, which is still considered a real solution, but perhaps the problem expects strictly less than zero, meaning no equality.\n\nBut the problem says \"has real solutions for \\( x \\)\", and it's an inequality, so maybe it's okay to have the discriminant equal to zero.\n\nBut let's check the discriminant again:\n\n\\( d = 36 - 4c \\geq 0 \\)\n\n\\( 36 \\geq 4c \\)\n\n\\( c \\leq 9 \\)\n\nAnd since \\( c > 0 \\), the interval for \\( c \\) is \\( (0, 9] \\).\n\nBut looking back at the options, option A is (0, 9), which seems close but doesn't include 9.\n\nOption B is (1, 1), which doesn't make much sense in this context.\n\nOption C is (6, 0), which seems incorrect because it suggests \\( c \\) less than 6, but according to our calculation, \\( c \\) can be up to 9.\n\nOption D is (6, 6), which also doesn't seem to align with our findings.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I need to consider more carefully what it means for the inequality to have real solutions.\n\nLet me think about the quadratic function \\( f(x) = x^2 - 6x + c \\).\n\nFor \\( f(x) < 0 \\) to have real solutions, the graph of \\( f(x) \\) must go below the x-axis at some points.\n\nSince the parabola opens upwards, if it touches or crosses the x-axis, there will be intervals where \\( f(x) < 0 \\).\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If the discriminant is greater than zero, there are two distinct real roots, and between these roots, \\( f(x) < 0 \\).\n\n- If the discriminant is equal to zero, there is exactly one real root, and \\( f(x) < 0 \\) only at that single point.\n\n- If the discriminant is less than zero, there are no real roots, and since the parabola opens upwards, \\( f(x) > 0 \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nGiven that, for the inequality \\( f(x) < 0 \\) to have real solutions, the discriminant must be greater than or equal to zero.\n\nSo, as before, \\( d = 36 - 4c \\geq 0 \\), which implies \\( c \\leq 9 \\).\n\nBut the problem specifies that \\( c \\) is positive, so \\( c > 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the interval for \\( c \\) is \\( (0, 9] \\).\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, none of them exactly match this interval.\n\nOption A is (0, 9), which excludes 9, but according to our calculation, \\( c \\) can be equal to 9.\n\nMaybe there's something I'm missing here.\n\nLet me consider the case when \\( c = 9 \\).\n\nThe quadratic becomes \\( x^2 - 6x + 9 = (x - 3)^2 \\).\n\nSo, \\( (x - 3)^2 < 0 \\).\n\nBut a square is never negative, so \\( (x - 3)^2 \\geq 0 \\) for all real \\( x \\).\n\nTherefore, there are no real solutions to \\( (x - 3)^2 < 0 \\).\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n\nSo, when \\( c = 9 \\), the discriminant \\( d = 36 - 4*9 = 0 \\), so there is exactly one real root at \\( x = 3 \\), and \\( f(x) \\geq 0 \\) for all \\( x \\), meaning \\( f(x) < 0 \\) has no real solutions.\n\nTherefore, \\( c = 9 \\) is not acceptable; the inequality \\( f(x) < 0 \\) does not have real solutions when \\( c = 9 \\).\n\nSo, I need to adjust my interval to exclude \\( c = 9 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( c \\) must be less than 9, but greater than 0.\n\nSo, the correct interval is \\( 0 < c < 9 \\), or in interval notation, \\( (0, 9) \\).\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is exactly that: (0, 9).\n\nOption B is (1, 1), which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption C is (6, 0), which seems incorrect.\n\nOption D is (6, 6), which also doesn't fit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A: (0, 9).\n\nTo confirm, let's consider a value of \\( c \\) within this interval.\n\nSuppose \\( c = 4 \\).\n\nThen, the quadratic is \\( x^2 - 6x + 4 \\).\n\nLet's find its roots:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 - 16}}{2} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2} = \\frac{6 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}}{2} = 3 \\pm \\sqrt{5} \\)\n\nSo, the roots are \\( x = 3 + \\sqrt{5} \\) and \\( x = 3 - \\sqrt{5} \\).\n\nBetween these two roots, \\( f(x) < 0 \\).\n\nIndeed, for \\( x \\) between \\( 3 - \\sqrt{5} \\) and \\( 3 + \\sqrt{5} \\), \\( f(x) < 0 \\), so there are real solutions to the inequality.\n\nNow, if I take \\( c = 9 \\), as I did earlier, \\( f(x) = (x - 3)^2 \\geq 0 \\) for all \\( x \\), and \\( f(x) < 0 \\) has no solutions, which confirms that \\( c = 9 \\) is not acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the correct interval is \\( c \\in (0, 9) \\), which corresponds to option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
