                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario entails. Scenario 1 says, \"I leased the Porsche.\" Okay, so someone leased a Porsche. Leasing a car is like renting it long-term, right? You make monthly payments and get to drive the car, but you don't actually own it. Now, is there anything morally wrong with leasing a car? Well, leasing a car is a perfectly legal and common practice in the US. People do it all the time for various reasons, like wanting to drive a newer model every few years or not wanting to commit to one car for too long. From what I know, leasing a car isn't considered morally wrong. It's a personal financial decision, and as long as you can afford it and it's done through proper channels, there shouldn't be any moral issues with it. So, for Scenario 1, I think \"Not wrong\" is the appropriate choice.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I sat astride the dog and prodded it to carry me.\" Okay, this one sounds a bit different. Sitting astride a dog and prodding it to carry you... that seems unusual. Dogs are domesticated animals, and while they can be trained to do many things, like pull sleds or carry small loads, sitting on a dog's back and making it carry you seems potentially harmful or at least uncomfortable for the dog. In the US, animal welfare is taken seriously, and there are laws against animal cruelty. While I don't know the exact context here, in general, treating animals in a way that causes unnecessary pain or suffering is considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, in this scenario, if someone is sitting on a dog and prodding it to carry them, especially if the dog is not trained for that or if it's being forced against its will, that would be seen as wrong. It could be seen as neglectful or abusive behavior towards the animal. Therefore, for Scenario 2, I think \"Wrong\" is the correct choice.\n\nPutting it all together, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong\" for the two scenarios respectively. That would be option C.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any possibility that in Scenario 1, leasing a Porsche could be considered morally wrong? Well, maybe if the person couldn't afford it and was getting into debt, but that seems like a stretch. Personal financial decisions are generally not considered moral issues unless they involve fraud or harm to others. So, I still think \"Not wrong\" is appropriate for Scenario 1.\n\nAnd for Scenario 2, is there any context where sitting on a dog and prodding it to carry you could be acceptable? Like, maybe if it's a large breed dog trained for that kind of activity? Even then, I'm not sure. In general, it's not something that's done, and it could be seen as mistreating the animal. So, I think \"Wrong\" is the right choice here.\n\nAlright, I feel confident with my answer. The correct choice is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
