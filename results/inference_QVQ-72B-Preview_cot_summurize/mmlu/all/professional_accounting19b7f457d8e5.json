                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have Lei-Feng, Inc.'s preferred stock with a par value of $100, and it just paid a $10 per share annual dividend. The current market price of the stock is $96 per share. We need to find the component cost of preferred stock for the company.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the cost of preferred stock is. I think it's the rate of return that the company must pay to its preferred stockholders. It's similar to the cost of debt but without the tax shield because preferred stock dividends are not tax-deductible.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions that the firm's marginal tax rate is 40%, and it asks for the component cost to Lei-Feng, Inc. So, maybe I need to consider the tax implications here.\n\nLet me first calculate the cost of preferred stock from the investor's perspective and then adjust it for the firm's cost.\n\nThe formula for the cost of preferred stock is:\n\n\\[ k_p = \\frac{D}{P} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( D \\) is the annual dividend per share\n\n- \\( P \\) is the current market price per share\n\nGiven that the dividend is $10 and the market price is $96, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ k_p = \\frac{10}{96} \\approx 0.1042 \\] or 10.42%\n\nWait, but that's the cost from the investor's perspective. For the firm, the cost would be different if there are tax implications.\n\nOh, but preferred stock dividends are not tax-deductible for the company, unlike interest payments on debt. So, the cost of preferred stock to the firm is actually the same as the cost to the investor because there's no tax shield.\n\nBut the problem mentions a tax rate of 40%, so maybe there's something else to consider.\n\nLet me think again. The cost of preferred stock is indeed the dividend yield, which is \\( \\frac{D}{P} \\), and since dividends are not tax-deductible, there's no need to adjust for taxes on the cost side.\n\nHowever, the problem mentions the firm's marginal tax rate and that the firm plans to maintain its current capital structure. Maybe this is related to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), where the cost of debt is adjusted for taxes.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for the component cost of preferred stock, not the WACC. So, perhaps the tax rate is just there to distract or to test if I know that preferred stock costs aren't adjusted for taxes.\n\nLet me check a textbook or a reliable source to confirm.\n\n[Imagining checking a finance textbook]\n\nOkay, according to standard corporate finance principles, the cost of preferred stock is indeed the dividend yield, and since dividends are not tax-deductible, the cost is not adjusted for taxes.\n\nSo, the cost of preferred stock is:\n\n\\[ k_p = \\frac{D}{P} = \\frac{10}{96} \\approx 10.42\\% \\]\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6 percent\n\nB. 6.25 percent\n\nC. 10 percent\n\nD. 10.4 percent\n\nThe closest option is D. 10.4 percent.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's something I'm missing. Let's see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the cost of preferred stock is calculated using the par value, but in this case, the problem gives both par value and market price. Since the market price is provided, it's more accurate to use that for the cost calculation.\n\nAnother consideration: preferred stock might have issuance costs, but the problem doesn't mention any, so perhaps we can ignore that.\n\nAlso, the problem states that the firm plans to maintain its current capital structure, but again, since we're only asked for the component cost of preferred stock, not the WACC, that might not directly affect this calculation.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the cost of preferred stock is approximately 10.42%, which is closest to option D. 10.4 percent.\n\nI think the answer is D. 10.4 percent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
