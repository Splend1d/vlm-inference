Donna Karan, and D. Christian Dior. Okay, I need to figure out which one of these designers was born in the U.S.\n\nFirst off, I know that fashion designers can be from all over the world, so I might not know immediately where each one is from. Maybe I should start by recalling what I know about each designer.\n\nStarting with Laura Ashley... I think Laura Ashley is a British fashion designer. I remember seeing Laura Ashley stores in the UK, and I think she was known for her floral patterns and country-style designs. So, if she's British, that would mean she wasn't born in the United States. But just to be sure, I should double-check.\n\nNext, Helmut Lang. I've heard of Helmut Lang as a fashion designer, but I'm not sure about his nationality. I think he might be Austrian. Let me see, I recall that he started his career in Vienna, which is in Austria, so that would make sense. If he's Austrian, then he wasn't born in the U.S. either.\n\nNow, Donna Karan. I'm pretty familiar with Donna Karan. I think she's American. She's known for her sleek, modern clothing and her brand includes lines like DKNY. I believe she was born and raised in the United States, possibly in New York City. That sounds right, so maybe C. Donna Karan is the answer.\n\nLastly, Christian Dior. I know Christian Dior is a famous French fashion designer. He founded the Dior fashion house in Paris, which is iconic in the fashion world. So, since he's French, he wasn't born in the U.S.\n\nLet me summarize what I've thought through:\n\n- Laura Ashley: British\n\n- Helmut Lang: Austrian\n\n- Donna Karan: American\n\n- Christian Dior: French\n\nBased on this, Donna Karan is the one who was born in the United States.\n\nJust to make sure I'm not missing something, maybe I should consider if any of these designers moved to the U.S. from another country. For example, perhaps someone was born in another country but later moved to the U.S. and established their career there. However, from what I recall, Donna Karan was born and raised in the U.S.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes, fashion brands are based in one country even if the designer isn't from there. But the question is specifically about where the designer was born, not where the brand is based.\n\nI think I'm confident with my conclusion that Donna Karan is the fashion designer born in the United States among the given options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C.
