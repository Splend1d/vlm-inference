                    "text": "So I have this problem here: I need to find all the zeros in the finite field Z_7 of the polynomial x^3 + 2x + 2. The options are A. 1, B. 2, C. 2,3, and D. 6. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what Z_7 is. Z_7 is the integers modulo 7, which means it consists of the elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, and all arithmetic operations are performed modulo 7. So, for example, 7 is congruent to 0, 8 is congruent to 1, and so on.\n\nNow, I have this polynomial: x^3 + 2x + 2. I need to find all the values of x in Z_7 that make this polynomial equal to zero. In other words, I need to solve the equation x^3 + 2x + 2 \u2261 0 mod 7.\n\nSince Z_7 is a small field, one straightforward approach is to plug in each value of x from 0 to 6 and see if the polynomial evaluates to zero modulo 7.\n\nLet's start with x = 0:\n\n0^3 + 2*0 + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 \u2260 0 mod 7\n\nSo, x = 0 is not a zero.\n\nNext, x = 1:\n\n1^3 + 2*1 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 \u2260 0 mod 7\n\nNot a zero.\n\nx = 2:\n\n2^3 + 2*2 + 2 = 8 + 4 + 2\n\nNow, 8 mod 7 is 1, 4 mod 7 is 4, and 2 mod 7 is 2. Adding them up: 1 + 4 + 2 = 7, which is 0 mod 7.\n\nSo, x = 2 is a zero.\n\nWait, but option A is 1, which we saw is not a zero, and option B is 2, which is a zero. Option C is 2,3, and option D is 6.\n\nLet me check x = 3:\n\n3^3 + 2*3 + 2 = 27 + 6 + 2 = 35\n\n35 mod 7 is 0, since 35 divided by 7 is 5.\n\nSo, x = 3 is also a zero.\n\nOption C includes both 2 and 3, so that seems possible.\n\nNow, let's check x = 4:\n\n4^3 + 2*4 + 2 = 64 + 8 + 2 = 74\n\n74 mod 7: 70 is divisible by 7 (7*10=70), so 74 - 70 = 4 \u2260 0 mod 7\n\nNot a zero.\n\nx = 5:\n\n5^3 + 2*5 + 2 = 125 + 10 + 2 = 137\n\n137 mod 7: 7*19 = 133, so 137 - 133 = 4 \u2260 0 mod 7\n\nNot a zero.\n\nx = 6:\n\n6^3 + 2*6 + 2 = 216 + 12 + 2 = 230\n\n230 mod 7: 7*32 = 224, so 230 - 224 = 6 \u2260 0 mod 7\n\nNot a zero.\n\nSo far, only x = 2 and x = 3 seem to be zeros in Z_7.\n\nBut wait, option D is 6, which we just checked and it's not a zero. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check x = 6:\n\n6^3 + 2*6 + 2 = 216 + 12 + 2 = 230\n\n230 mod 7: 7*32 = 224, 230 - 224 = 6 \u2260 0\n\nNo, that's correct.\n\nOption A is 1, which is not a zero.\n\nOption B is 2, which is a zero.\n\nOption C is 2 and 3, both are zeros.\n\nOption D is 6, which is not a zero.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 2,3.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nIs there a possibility of multiple roots in a finite field? Well, in Z_7, which is a field, a polynomial of degree n can have at most n roots, counting multiplicity. Since it's a cubic, it can have at most three roots. Here, I only found two, which matches option C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to factor the polynomial or see if it can be reduced somehow, but given the small size of Z_7, plugging in values seems efficient enough.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that in finite fields, sometimes polynomials can have unexpected behaviors, but in Z_7, which is a prime field, it behaves nicely.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. 2,3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
