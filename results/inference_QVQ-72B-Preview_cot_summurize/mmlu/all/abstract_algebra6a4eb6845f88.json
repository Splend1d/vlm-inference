                    "text": "So I've got this problem here with two statements about rings and fields, and I need to determine whether each statement is true or false. Let's tackle them one at a time.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: \"If R is a ring and f(x) and g(x) are in R[x], then deg (f(x) + g(x)) = maximum (deg f(x), deg g(x)).\"\n\nHmm, this seems familiar from polynomial algebra. I know that in a ring R, the polynomial ring R[x] consists of all polynomials with coefficients in R. The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of x with a nonzero coefficient.\n\nNow, the statement claims that the degree of the sum of two polynomials is equal to the maximum of their individual degrees. But wait a minute, I think there's a condition missing here. What if the leading terms cancel out when you add the polynomials? Wouldn't that affect the degree of the sum?\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose R is the integers modulo 2, so R = Z/2Z. Then R[x] is the polynomial ring over Z/2Z. Let f(x) = x^2 + 1 and g(x) = x^2 + x. Both have degree 2. Their sum f(x) + g(x) = (x^2 + 1) + (x^2 + x) = 2x^2 + x + 1. But in Z/2Z, 2x^2 is just 0, so the sum is x + 1, which has degree 1. That's less than the maximum degree of f and g, which is 2. So in this case, deg (f(x) + g(x)) is not equal to the maximum of deg f(x) and deg g(x).\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is false in general. It's only true if the leading coefficients of f and g don't cancel each other out when added. So, the correct general statement should be that deg (f(x) + g(x)) is less than or equal to the maximum of deg f(x) and deg g(x).\n\nAlright, moving on to Statement 2: \"If F is a field then every ideal of F[x] is principal.\"\n\nI recall that a principal ideal is an ideal generated by a single element. So, this statement is asserting that in the polynomial ring over a field, every ideal can be generated by just one element.\n\nI know that F[x] is a principal ideal domain (PID) when F is a field. A PID is an integral domain in which every ideal is principal. So, if F is a field, then F[x] is indeed a PID.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about it. In F[x], any ideal I can be generated by the polynomial of least degree in I. Since F is a field, the division algorithm holds in F[x], which allows us to perform polynomial division with remainder. This means that for any polynomial f(x) in I, we can divide it by the generator g(x) of the ideal, and the remainder will be zero or of lower degree. So, every ideal is indeed principal.\n\nMoreover, this is a fundamental property of polynomial rings over fields, and it's a key result in abstract algebra.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Statement 1 is false, as shown by the counterexample where the leading terms cancel in the sum.\n\n- Statement 2 is true, based on the known fact that polynomial rings over fields are principal ideal domains.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct choice is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
