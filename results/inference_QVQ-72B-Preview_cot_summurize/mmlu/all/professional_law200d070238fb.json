                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a new agency created by Congress to prevent price gouging in gasoline sales. There are seven members in this agency: four appointed by the President, two by the Senate, and one by the Speaker of the House. They can issue rules interpreting existing federal regulations and \"cease and desist\" orders against retailers who intentionally gouge prices. Violating these orders can lead to fines or imprisonment.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the strongest constitutional argument against the agency's authority. There are four options:\n\nA. Congress can't delegate to the agency the power to interpret existing federal laws.\n\nB. Congress can't delegate to the agency the power to issue \"cease and desist\" orders that, if violated, lead to imprisonment.\n\nC. Congress can't delegate enforcement of a federal law to any body other than the U.S. Attorney General or the courts.\n\nD. Congress can't retain the power to appoint even a minority of members of such an agency.\n\nI need to think through each one.\n\nStarting with option A: Can Congress delegate to an agency the power to interpret existing federal laws?\n\nFrom what I recall, Congress often delegates rulemaking authority to agencies, which includes interpreting statutes to some degree. This is pretty common in administrative law. Agencies are seen as experts in their fields and are better equipped to flesh out the details of complex regulations. So, I'm not sure that this is a strong constitutional argument. Maybe there are limits, but generally, delegation of rulemaking authority is accepted.\n\nMoving on to option B: Can Congress delegate to an agency the power to issue \"cease and desist\" orders that can lead to imprisonment if violated?\n\nThis seems trickier. While agencies can issue orders and regulations, when it comes to enforcing those orders, especially with penalties like imprisonment, that starts to encroach on judicial and possibly executive functions. Imprisonment is a severe penalty, and it's typically within the purview of the judiciary to impose such penalties after a trial. So, having an agency issue orders that directly lead to imprisonment might be seen as violating the separation of powers principle.\n\nOption C: Can Congress delegate enforcement of a federal law to any body other than the U.S. Attorney General or the courts?\n\nThis seems related to the idea that enforcement of laws is an executive function. The U.S. Attorney General is part of the executive branch, and the courts are judicial. If Congress delegates enforcement powers to another body, it might be seen as overstepping its bounds. However, agencies often have enforcement powers, like issuing fines or taking corrective actions. But imprisonment is a serious step, so maybe there's a line there.\n\nOption D: Can Congress retain the power to appoint even a minority of members of such an agency?\n\nThe appointments clause of the Constitution generally gives the President the power to appoint officers of the United States, with the advice and consent of the Senate. However, there are independent agencies where appointments are made by other means. In this case, Congress is appointing two members, and the Speaker of the House is appointing one. This might be seen as Congress encroaching on the President's appointment powers, especially since the President is only appointing four out of seven members. But again, there are precedents for independent agencies with appointments from multiple branches.\n\nSo, weighing these options, I think option B is the strongest constitutional argument. The reason is that involving an agency in issuing orders that directly lead to imprisonment seems to blur the lines between the executive and judicial branches. Imprisonment is a severe punishment that typically requires judicial oversight to ensure due process is followed. Allowing an agency to issue orders that result in imprisonment without judicial intervention could be seen as a violation of the separation of powers doctrine.\n\nOption C is also relevant, as enforcement is generally an executive function, but since agencies are often part of the executive branch and do have enforcement powers, it's not as clear-cut. Option D touches on the appointments clause, but again, there are independent agencies with various appointment mechanisms.\n\nTherefore, I would say that option B presents the strongest constitutional argument against the agency's authority.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
