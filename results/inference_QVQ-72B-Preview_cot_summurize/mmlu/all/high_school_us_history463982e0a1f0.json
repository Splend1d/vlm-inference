                    "text": "So I've got this question about Phillis Wheatley's poem \"On Being Brought from Africa to America,\" and it's asking which ideas most directly influenced the poem. The options are the First Great Awakening, John Locke's theory of natural rights, British ideas about social hierarchy, and eighteenth-century scientific racism. I need to pick the one that's most directly influential.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the poem is about. It's written by Phillis Wheatley, who was a slave brought from Africa to America in the 18th century. She became famous for her poetry, which often dealt with themes of slavery, religion, and her own experiences.\n\nIn this poem, she talks about how she was brought from her \"Pagan land\" to America, where she learned about Christianity and salvation. She mentions that before coming to America, she didn't know about redemption. Then she addresses the way some people view Africans with scorn, saying things like \"their color is a diabolic dye.\" But she counters that by suggesting that even people as dark as Cain can be refined and join the angels.\n\nSo, the poem seems to be about her personal journey from paganism to Christianity, and also a plea for acceptance and the idea that Africans can be just as capable of spiritual enlightenment as anyone else.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. The First Great Awakening: This was a religious revival movement that spread through the American colonies in the mid-18th century. It emphasized personal faith and direct experience with God, rather than just following church doctrine. It also promoted the idea that anyone could achieve salvation, regardless of social status or background.\n\nB. The natural rights theory of John Locke: Locke was an English philosopher who argued that all people are born with certain inherent rights, like life, liberty, and property. His ideas were influential in the American Revolution and the development of democratic thought.\n\nC. British ideas about social hierarchy: This would involve the class systems and notions of social superiority that were prevalent in British society, which often justified slavery and the subordination of certain groups based on race or class.\n\nD. Eighteenth-century scientific racism: This refers to the emerging ideas in science at the time that tried to categorize human races and often justified racial hierarchies based on supposed biological differences.\n\nGiven the content of the poem, which focuses on religious themes and the potential for spiritual growth in all people, regardless of race, I think the First Great Awakening is the most direct influence. The poem emphasizes the possibility of salvation and spiritual refinement for Africans, which aligns with the Awakening's message of equal access to salvation for all individuals, irrespective of their background.\n\nJohn Locke's theory of natural rights is also relevant to the broader context of equality and rights, but the poem seems more focused on religious salvation and less on political or natural rights. British ideas about social hierarchy seem contrary to the message of the poem, as Wheatley is arguing against viewing Africans with scorn. Similarly, scientific racism would support the kind of views she's critiquing in the poem.\n\nSo, I believe the correct answer is A. The First Great Awakening.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a connection to Locke that I'm missing. Locke believed in the equality of all men at birth, which could be seen as relating to Wheatley's idea that Africans can be equal in terms of salvation. However, the poem is more explicitly religious, and the First Great Awakening was a significant religious movement that emphasized personal faith and the idea that anyone could achieve salvation, which directly relates to Wheatley's message.\n\nAlso, considering the time period, the First Great Awakening was happening around the time Wheatley was writing (she published her poetry in 1773), so it makes sense that it would influence her work.\n\nI think I'm confident with this choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
