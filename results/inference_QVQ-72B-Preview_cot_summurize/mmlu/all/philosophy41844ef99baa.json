The options are:\n\nA. natural virtues and artificial virtues.\n\nB. moral virtues and intellectual virtues.\n\nC. positive virtues and negative virtues.\n\nD. human virtues and divine virtues.\n\nI need to recall how Aristotle divided virtues. I remember that Aristotle was a big figure in philosophy, especially ethics, and he talked a lot about virtues and vices.\n\nLet me think about his Nicomachean Ethics, which is where he discusses ethics. He talks about the concept of the \"golden mean,\" right? That virtue is a mean between two vices, one of excess and one of deficiency.\n\nBut that's about individual virtues, like courage being the mean between rashness and cowardice. That's not directly about how he divides virtues into categories.\n\nSo, I need to recall if Aristotle categorizes virtues into different types.\n\nOption B suggests moral virtues and intellectual virtues. That sounds familiar. I think he does make a distinction between moral virtues, which are about character and how we act, and intellectual virtues, which are about knowledge and wisdom.\n\nLet me see if I can remember any specific examples he gives.\n\nFor moral virtues, there's courage, temperance, generosity, and so on. For intellectual virtues, there's wisdom, understanding, prudence.\n\nYeah, that seems to align with what I recall. So, option B seems plausible.\n\nBut let's consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: natural virtues and artificial virtues. I'm not sure about this one. I don't remember Aristotle using those terms in relation to virtues. Maybe he talks about natural and artificial in other contexts, like in politics or something, but not specifically about virtues.\n\nOption C: positive virtues and negative virtues. This seems a bit vague. In ethics, we often think of virtues as positive traits, and vices as negative traits. So, maybe he doesn't categorize virtues themselves as positive or negative.\n\nOption D: human virtues and divine virtues. Hmm, Aristotle was more of a secular philosopher, focusing on human flourishing and ethics without invoking divine elements. So, while there might be discussions of divine attributes, I don't think he categorizes virtues into human and divine.\n\nGiven this reflection, I think the most accurate answer is option B: moral virtues and intellectual virtues.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll try to recall if there's any other way he divides virtues. Maybe into cardinal virtues or something, but I think that's more of a later development in ethics.\n\nAlso, I recall that Aristotle discusses the importance of both moral and intellectual virtues for achieving eudaimonia, or human flourishing. So, that reinforces the idea that he considers both types of virtues essential.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. moral virtues and intellectual virtues.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
