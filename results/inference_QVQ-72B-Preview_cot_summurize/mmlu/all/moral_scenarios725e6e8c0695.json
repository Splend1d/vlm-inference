                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. I'm not super familiar with what was going on in 2020, but I'll try my best.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I like my boyfriend Bill, and he's attracted to me; I'm planted one on him to see if sparks would fly.\"\n\nOkay, so there's a couple here, both attracted to each other, and one of them decides to kiss the other to see if there's a connection. Hmm, is this morally wrong?\n\nWell, kissing someone you're attracted to isn't usually considered wrong, especially if both parties are consenting adults and in a relationship. They seem to be boyfriend and girlfriend, so presumably, they're in a consensual relationship. Planting a kiss to see if there's a spark might be a bit impulsive, but it doesn't seem inherently immoral.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Maybe one of them isn't ready for that step, or perhaps there are boundaries they agreed on. But the scenario doesn't provide any information about that. It just says they like each other and are attracted.\n\nSo, based on the information given, it doesn't seem like this action is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I cut and divvied up the livestock.\"\n\nThis one is a bit vaguer. Who is \"I\"? Is \"I\" the owner of the livestock, or maybe someone else? Cutting and divvying up livestock could be a normal part of farm management, like dividing them for different purposes or among different owners.\n\nBut if \"I\" is not the owner and is doing this without permission, that could be wrong. Or if the livestock are being mistreated in the process, that would be immoral.\n\nHowever, the scenario doesn't provide context about ownership or the conditions under which this is happening. It just says \"I cut and divvied up the livestock.\"\n\nAssuming that \"I\" is the owner and is doing this in a responsible manner, then it's probably not morally wrong. But if \"I\" is not the owner or is treating the animals poorly, that would be wrong.\n\nSince the scenario doesn't specify, it's a bit tricky. But perhaps the question assumes that \"I\" is acting in a way that's consistent with ordinary moral standards, unless specified otherwise.\n\nGiven that, I'll tentatively say that Scenario 2 isn't clearly morally wrong based on the information provided.\n\nSo, according to my analysis, neither scenario is clearly morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSince I think neither is wrong based on the information given, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure because the question might be trying to trick me by providing incomplete information. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIn Scenario 1, it's about a consensual relationship where both parties are attracted to each other, and one initiates a kiss to see if there's a spark. Unless there's something else going on, like one party being underage or not fully consenting, which isn't indicated here, it seems okay.\n\nIn Scenario 2, cutting and divvying up livestock could be a routine agricultural practice, like separating cows for breeding or sale. If done properly and ethically, it's not wrong. But again, without knowing the context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with my initial choice: D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
