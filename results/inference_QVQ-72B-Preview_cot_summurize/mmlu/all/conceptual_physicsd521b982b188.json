                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem here: \"If two protons and two neutrons are removed from the nucleus of neon-20, a nucleus of which element remains? The options are A. Magnesium-22, B. Magnesium-20, C. Oxygen-18, D. Oxygen-16.\"\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's happening here. We have neon-20, and we're removing two protons and two neutrons from its nucleus. I need to figure out what element that leaves behind.\n\nSo, let's start by recalling some basic atomic structure. An atom consists of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, and electrons orbiting around the nucleus. The number of protons determines the element. For example, neon has an atomic number of 10, which means it has 10 protons in its nucleus.\n\nThe mass number of an atom is the sum of the protons and neutrons in the nucleus. So, neon-20 has a mass number of 20, meaning there are 10 protons and 10 neutrons in its nucleus.\n\nNow, if we remove two protons and two neutrons, we need to see what's left.\n\nFirst, removing two protons from neon, which has 10 protons, would leave us with 10 - 2 = 8 protons. Removing two neutrons from the 10 neutrons would leave us with 10 - 2 = 8 neutrons.\n\nSo, the resulting nucleus would have 8 protons and 8 neutrons, which adds up to a mass number of 16.\n\nNow, what element has 8 protons? That's oxygen. So, the element remaining should be oxygen.\n\nLooking at the options, both C and D have oxygen, but they have different mass numbers: C is oxygen-18 and D is oxygen-16.\n\nGiven that we have 8 protons and 8 neutrons left, the mass number should be 8 + 8 = 16. So, that would be oxygen-16.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWe started with neon-20, which has 10 protons and 10 neutrons.\n\nRemoved two protons and two neutrons.\n\nSo, 10 - 2 = 8 protons.\n\n10 - 2 = 8 neutrons.\n\nTotal mass number: 8 + 8 = 16.\n\nTherefore, the remaining nucleus is oxygen-16.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Magnesium-22\n\nB. Magnesium-20\n\nC. Oxygen-18\n\nD. Oxygen-16\n\nSo, D. Oxygen-16 is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, but let's think about isotopes. Oxygen has several isotopes, like oxygen-16, oxygen-17, and oxygen-18. But in this case, since we're removing two protons and two neutrons from neon-20, which has 10 protons and 10 neutrons, we end up with 8 protons and 8 neutrons, which is oxygen-16.\n\nI think that's straightforward.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret \"removing two protons and two neutrons.\"\n\nCould there be a nuclear reaction or something that might change the number of protons and neutrons differently? No, because in nuclear reactions, protons and neutrons are conserved in the sense that they don't just disappear; they're either converted into other particles or remain as they are.\n\nBut in this problem, it's simply about removing two protons and two neutrons directly from the nucleus.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is D. Oxygen-16.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
