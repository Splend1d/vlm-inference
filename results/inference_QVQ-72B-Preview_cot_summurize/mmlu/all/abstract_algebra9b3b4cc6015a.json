From what I remember, a generator of a finite field is an element that can generate all the non-zero elements of the field through its powers. Since Z_7 is the integers modulo 7, which is a prime number, I know that Z_7 is indeed a field.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the non-zero elements of Z_7: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nI need to check each element to see if its powers generate all these elements.\n\nLet's start with option A: 1.\n\nWell, 1^1 = 1, 1^2 = 1, and so on, it just stays 1. So, 1 can't be a generator because it doesn't generate all the non-zero elements.\n\nNext, option B: 2.\n\nLet's compute the powers of 2 modulo 7.\n\n2^1 = 2 mod 7 = 2\n\n2^2 = 4 mod 7 = 4\n\n2^3 = 8 mod 7 = 1\n\n2^4 = 2*2^3 = 2*1 = 2 mod 7 = 2, and it's starting to repeat.\n\nSo, the powers of 2 give {2, 4, 1}, which doesn't cover all non-zero elements. So, 2 is not a generator.\n\nOption C: 3.\n\nLet's compute the powers of 3 modulo 7.\n\n3^1 = 3 mod 7 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9 mod 7 = 2\n\n3^3 = 3*3^2 = 3*2 = 6 mod 7 = 6\n\n3^4 = 3*3^3 = 3*6 = 18 mod 7 = 4\n\n3^5 = 3*3^4 = 3*4 = 12 mod 7 = 5\n\n3^6 = 3*3^5 = 3*5 = 15 mod 7 = 1\n\nSo, the powers of 3 modulo 7 cycle through {3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1}, which includes all non-zero elements of Z_7. Therefore, 3 is a generator of Z_7.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check option D: 4.\n\nCompute the powers of 4 modulo 7.\n\n4^1 = 4 mod 7 = 4\n\n4^2 = 16 mod 7 = 2\n\n4^3 = 4*4^2 = 4*2 = 8 mod 7 = 1\n\n4^4 = 4*4^3 = 4*1 = 4 mod 7 = 4, and it's repeating.\n\nSo, the powers of 4 give {4, 2, 1}, which doesn't cover all non-zero elements. Hence, 4 is not a generator.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
