                    "text": "So I have this question about deflating nominal GDP. It's been a while since I've studied economics, but I think I can figure this out. The question is: \"To deflate nominal gross domestic product (GDP), you must...\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. divide nominal GDP by the GDP deflator.\n\nB. multiply real GDP by the GDP deflator.\n\nC. divide real GDP by the GDP deflator.\n\nD. multiply nominal GDP by the GDP deflator.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember what deflating nominal GDP means. I know that nominal GDP is the total value of all finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period, valued at current market prices. But it doesn't account for inflation or deflation, which can make comparisons over time tricky.\n\nThat's where the GDP deflator comes in. The GDP deflator is a measure of the level of prices of all new, domestically produced, final goods and services in an economy. It's a way to adjust nominal GDP for changes in price levels, essentially turning it into real GDP, which reflects the actual volume of production.\n\nSo, deflating nominal GDP means adjusting it to remove the effects of inflation, right? To get real GDP. I think the formula is Real GDP = Nominal GDP / GDP Deflator, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about this.\n\nWait, actually, I think the exact formula is Real GDP = Nominal GDP / (GDP Deflator / 100). Because the GDP deflator is an index number, often with a base year of 100. So, to adjust nominal GDP to real terms, you divide by the deflator and then multiply by 100, but sometimes the 100 is implied.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose nominal GDP is $100, and the GDP deflator is 125. That means prices have increased by 25% since the base year. To find real GDP, I need to adjust for this inflation. So, if nominal GDP is $100 and prices have gone up by 25%, then the real value should be less than $100.\n\nUsing option A: divide nominal GDP by the GDP deflator. So, $100 / 125 = $0.80. That seems too low. Wait, but maybe I need to adjust it differently.\n\nOption D: multiply nominal GDP by the GDP deflator. $100 * 125 = $125,000. That seems too high.\n\nOption B: multiply real GDP by the GDP deflator. But that doesn't help me find real GDP from nominal GDP.\n\nOption C: divide real GDP by the GDP deflator. That seems like it would increase the value, which doesn't make sense if I'm trying to deflate nominal GDP.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me recall the relationship between nominal GDP, real GDP, and the GDP deflator.\n\nI think the formula is:\n\nGDP Deflator = (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) * 100\n\nSo, rearranging that, Real GDP = (Nominal GDP / GDP Deflator) * 100\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, to find real GDP, you divide nominal GDP by the GDP deflator and then multiply by 100.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none of them exactly say that. Option A says divide nominal GDP by the GDP deflator, but doesn't mention multiplying by 100. Maybe the 100 is implied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the GDP deflator is already adjusted by 100. I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nLet me try another approach. Suppose the base year is 2000, and the GDP deflator in 2000 is 100. In 2010, the deflator is 120. If nominal GDP in 2010 is $120, then real GDP (in 2000 prices) should be $100.\n\nSo, to get real GDP, I need to divide nominal GDP by the deflator index and then multiply by the base year's deflator, which is 100.\n\nWait, no. If the deflator in 2010 is 120, and nominal GDP is $120, then real GDP in 2000 prices would be $120 / (120/100) = $120 / 1.2 = $100. That makes sense.\n\nSo, in general, Real GDP = Nominal GDP / (GDP Deflator / 100)\n\nTherefore, to deflate nominal GDP, you divide it by the GDP deflator and then multiply by 100, but since it's an index with a base of 100, dividing by the deflator divided by 100 gives the real GDP.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. divide nominal GDP by the GDP deflator.\n\nThis is close but incomplete. It should be divided by the deflator divided by 100.\n\nB. multiply real GDP by the GDP deflator.\n\nThis seems to be the inverse operation, which wouldn't deflate nominal GDP.\n\nC. divide real GDP by the GDP deflator.\n\nThis would inflate real GDP to nominal GDP, not deflate.\n\nD. multiply nominal GDP by the GDP deflator.\n\nThis would overinflate the GDP, which isn't correct for deflating.\n\nGiven these considerations, option A is the closest to the correct answer, but it's missing the adjustment for the base 100. However, among the given choices, option A is the best answer, as it involves dividing nominal GDP by the GDP deflator, which, if adjusted properly, would give real GDP.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating this. In practice, the GDP deflator is often used directly in this way, and the division of nominal GDP by the deflator (assumed to be in terms of 100) gives real GDP.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. divide nominal GDP by the GDP deflator.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
