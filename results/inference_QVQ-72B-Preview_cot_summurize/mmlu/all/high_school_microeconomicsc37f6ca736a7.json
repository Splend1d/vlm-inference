                    "text": "So I have this question about normal goods and their demand curves. It says that normal goods always have a/an... and then there are four options: A. elastic demand curve, B. inelastic demand curve, C. elastic supply curve, D. positive income elasticity. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a normal good is. I think a normal good is one where demand increases when income increases, right? So, it's like, when people have more money, they buy more of this good. Makes sense.\n\nNow, the question is about the demand curve's properties. The options are about elasticity, specifically demand elasticity and supply elasticity, and also income elasticity. I need to distinguish between these.\n\nOption A says elastic demand curve. Elastic demand means that a small change in price leads to a relatively larger change in quantity demanded. So, if price goes up a little, people buy a lot less, or if price goes down a little, they buy a lot more. But does this relate directly to normal goods?\n\nOption B is inelastic demand curve. Inelastic demand means that changes in price have a smaller effect on quantity demanded. So, even if the price changes a lot, the quantity demanded doesn't change much.\n\nOption C is elastic supply curve. Supply elasticity refers to how much the quantity supplied changes in response to a change in price. If supply is elastic, a small change in price leads to a large change in quantity supplied.\n\nOption D is positive income elasticity. Income elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in consumers' income. If it's positive, it means that when income increases, demand increases, and vice versa.\n\nWait a minute, all of these are about elasticity, but some are about demand, some about supply, and some about income. The question is specifically about normal goods, which are defined in terms of their relationship between income and demand.\n\nSo, normal goods have positive income elasticity. That sounds like option D. But is that the only characteristic, or is there more to it?\n\nLet me think about this. Normal goods are goods where demand increases as income increases, which is a positive income elasticity. So, option D seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Could the demand curve for normal goods also have certain properties in terms of price elasticity?\n\nFor example, are normal goods typically price elastic or inelastic? Well, that might depend on the specific good. Some normal goods might have elastic demand, like luxury cars, where a small price change leads to a big change in quantity demanded. Others might have inelastic demand, like basic necessities that people still need even if prices go up.\n\nSo, it seems like normal goods can have either elastic or inelastic demand curves depending on the good in question. Therefore, options A and B might not necessarily always hold true for all normal goods.\n\nSimilarly, option C is about the supply curve being elastic. Again, supply elasticity can vary across different goods. Some goods might have very elastic supply, meaning producers can quickly adjust how much they produce in response to price changes, while others might have inelastic supply, like land or natural resources that can't be easily increased in quantity.\n\nSo, again, option C doesn't seem to necessarily always apply to normal goods.\n\nGiven that, it seems like option D, positive income elasticity, is the most accurate description that applies to all normal goods. That's basically the definition of a normal good: as income increases, demand increases, which is a positive relationship, hence positive income elasticity.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I should consider an example. Suppose there's a good, say, smartphones. As people's incomes increase, they are more likely to buy newer, more advanced smartphones. So, demand increases with income, which means positive income elasticity. Now, is the demand curve for smartphones elastic or inelastic? Well, that would depend on factors like availability of substitutes, consumer preferences, and so on. So, it could be either, which again suggests that options A and B aren't always true.\n\nWhat about the supply of smartphones? Again, that's a separate issue. Producers might be able to adjust supply quickly in response to price changes, making supply elastic, or there might be constraints that make supply inelastic. So, supply elasticity isn't directly tied to whether a good is normal or not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. positive income elasticity.\n\nWait, but let's see if there's any chance that a normal good could have negative income elasticity. No, that wouldn't make sense. By definition, normal goods have positive income elasticity; inferior goods have negative income elasticity.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that option D is the correct choice.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any relationship between income elasticity and price elasticity. For example, do goods with high income elasticity tend to have certain price elasticity properties? Well, not necessarily. Income elasticity and price elasticity are measuring different things: one measures the response of demand to income changes, and the other measures the response of demand to price changes.\n\nTherefore, while both are important in understanding consumer behavior, they don't directly determine each other.\n\nSo, in conclusion, normal goods always have a positive income elasticity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
