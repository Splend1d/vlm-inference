                    "text": " So I'm trying to understand this \"despotism argument\" by Kass regarding cloning. It sounds like he's discussing some ethical issues with cloning, especially reproductive cloning. The question is asking which option is a premise of his argument. Let me see what each option says.\n\nOption A says: Cloning is inherently morally wrong. Hmm, that seems pretty straightforward. If cloning is inherently wrong, then that would be a strong premise against it. But I wonder if Kass actually believes that cloning is inherently immoral. Maybe he does, but I should check.\n\nOption B: In reproductive cloning, one seeks to impose one's will on a child's future. That sounds interesting. It suggests that when someone clones themselves reproductively, they're somehow dictating or controlling the child's future in an unethical way. This could be seen as a form of despotism, where the parent is imposing their desires onto the child without considering the child's own potential wishes or identity. That seems like a possible premise.\n\nOption C: The permissibility of cloning depends on the parent's intent to raise the child. This is a bit different. It suggests that whether cloning is morally acceptable or not depends on the intentions of the parents who are cloning. So, if the parents intend to raise the child well, maybe it's permissible, but if they don't have good intentions, it's not. This seems more about the moral character of the parents rather than the act of cloning itself.\n\nOption D: We have a good reason not to clone. This is quite vague. It just states that there's a good reason to avoid cloning, but it doesn't specify what that reason is. It could be based on various premises, like ethical concerns, practical issues, or unknown risks.\n\nGiven that the question is about Kass's despotism argument, I need to recall what his main premise is in this context. From what I remember, Kass argues that reproductive cloning treats the child as a means to an end, rather than as an end in itself. He believes that cloning for reproductive purposes involves a kind of hubris or overreaching of human control over nature.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing it with his other arguments. Let me focus back on the despotism aspect. Despotism generally refers to the abuse of power or authority, often in a way that suppresses individual freedom. In the context of cloning, Kass might be arguing that parents who clone their children are exerting too much control over the child's genetic makeup and perhaps even their identity, thereby treating the child as an extension of themselves rather than as a separate individual.\n\nSo, looking back at the options, Option B seems to align closely with this idea. It specifically mentions imposing one's will on a child's future, which sounds like a form of despotism.\n\nOption A, saying that cloning is inherently morally wrong, might be a conclusion rather than a premise. Premises are the reasons or beliefs that support a conclusion. So, if Kass's argument is that cloning is wrong because it involves despotism, then saying that cloning is inherently wrong would be more of a conclusion.\n\nOption C is about the parent's intent, which might be relevant, but it doesn't directly address the despotism issue. It's more about the moral character of the parents rather than the act of cloning itself.\n\nOption D is too vague to be a strong premise for the despotism argument. It just states that there's a good reason not to clone, but doesn't specify what that reason is.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is Option B: In reproductive cloning, one seeks to impose one's will on a child's future. This directly relates to the concept of despotism, as it involves one person (the parent) exerting control over another (the cloned child) in a way that may disregard the child's own autonomy and future preferences.\n\nTo make sure, let me think about it differently. If I were to construct an argument based on despotism against reproductive cloning, what would be a key premise? It would probably be that cloning allows parents to exert undue influence over the child's genetic identity and perhaps even their life choices, thereby treating the child as a means to fulfill the parents' desires rather than respecting the child as an end in themselves.\n\nYes, that sounds a lot like what Option B is saying. So, I'm confident that Option B is the correct premise of Kass's despotism argument regarding cloning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
