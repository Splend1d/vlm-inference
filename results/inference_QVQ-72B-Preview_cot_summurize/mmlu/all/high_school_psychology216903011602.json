I need to think about the typical development milestones for children. Let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that children develop motor skills and language skills at certain ages. Motor skills are things like using their hands to manipulate objects, and language skills involve speaking and understanding language.\n\nOption A is writing with a pencil. That's a pretty advanced fine motor skill, I think. I don't remember exactly when most kids start to write with a pencil, but I think it's around preschool age, maybe 4 or 5 years old.\n\nOption B is cutting with a knife. That also seems like a fine motor skill, and it probably develops around the same time as writing, maybe a bit later since using a knife can be dangerous and parents might delay teaching that.\n\nOption C is saying a sentence. Language development starts early, with babies cooing and babbling, and then saying their first words around 1 year old. Simple sentences might come around 2 years old, but more complex sentences might be later.\n\nOption D is clapping their hands. That sounds like a gross motor skill, which develops earlier than fine motor skills. Clapping requires coordination between both hands, but it's not as precise as writing or cutting.\n\nWait, actually, I think clapping is considered a milestone that babies often reach around 9 to 12 months old. Let me confirm that. Yeah, according to various child development charts, clapping is typically mastered around 9 to 12 months.\n\nSo, comparing that to the other options:\n\n- Writing with a pencil: around 4-5 years old\n\n- Cutting with a knife: maybe around 5-6 years old or later, depending on the family\n\n- Saying a sentence: around 2 years old for simple sentences\n\n- Clapping hands: around 9 to 12 months old\n\nSo, clearly, clapping hands is the earliest skill developed among these options.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe some children start saying simple sentences earlier than 2 years old. I think the average is around 18 to 24 months for twowords sentences, but some kids might start earlier.\n\nHowever, clapping hands is often seen even in infants as young as 9 months old, sometimes earlier if they're imitating adults.\n\nSo, unless a child is particularly advanced in language development, clapping hands is likely the first skill they'll develop among these options.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that motor skills develop in a certain sequence, from gross motor to fine motor. Clapping is a gross motor skill, while writing and cutting are fine motor skills, which develop later.\n\nLanguage development is separate from motor skills, but in this case, clapping still seems to come earlier.\n\nLet me think if there's any exception or special case that might make another skill develop first. For example, some children might start saying simple sentences before they start clapping, but I think that's rare.\n\nAlso, writing and cutting are both activities that require a certain level of hand-eye coordination and fine motor control that typically develops after clapping.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I would say that most children will develop the ability to clap their hands first among these options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
