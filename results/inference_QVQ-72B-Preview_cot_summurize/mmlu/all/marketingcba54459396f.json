                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about product bundling. It says that when a product or service is offered together with another, usually complementary product or service, that's called... and the options are product pricing, price differentiation, pure price bundling, or odd-number pricing. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what product bundling is. From what I recall, bundling is a strategy where companies sell multiple products as a single package. So, instead of buying them separately, you get them together. The question mentions that these products are typically complementary, meaning they go well together or enhance each other's value.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Product pricing: This sounds more general. It's probably about setting prices for individual products, not specifically about combining them. So, maybe not the right choice here.\n\nB. Price differentiation: This seems like charging different prices for the same product based on factors like customer segments or geographical locations. Again, that's not directly about bundling products together. Maybe not the answer.\n\nC. Pure price bundling: Now, this sounds promising. Bundling usually refers to selling multiple products as a single unit. \"Pure price bundling\" might be a specific type of bundling where only the bundled option is offered, and no separate purchases are allowed. But the question seems to be referring to the general concept of bundling, not necessarily a specific type. Maybe this is the answer, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nD. Odd-number pricing: This is a tactic where prices are set slightly below a round number, like $9.99 instead of $10.00, to make the price seem more attractive. Definitely not about bundling products together.\n\nSo, between options A, B, C, and D, C. Pure price bundling seems the most relevant to the description given in the question. But wait, I think there might be some confusion here. The question says \"a product or service is offered together with another typically complementary product or service.\" That sounds like general product bundling, but the option is \"pure price bundling,\" which might be a specific type of bundling strategy.\n\nLet me double-check. In economics and marketing, there are different types of bundling strategies:\n\n1. Pure bundling: Here, products are only sold as a bundle, and not individually.\n\n2. Mixed bundling: Products are sold both individually and as part of a bundle.\n\n3. Product bundling: This is the general term for selling multiple products as a single offering.\n\nGiven that, the question seems to be describing the general concept of product bundling, where complementary products are offered together. However, option C is \"pure price bundling,\" which sounds like a specific type of bundling where the focus is on the price advantage of the bundle.\n\nMaybe the question has a typo, or perhaps \"pure price bundling\" is indeed the correct term for what's being described. Since I'm not entirely sure, and the other options don't fit as well, I'll go with C. Pure price bundling.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider an example. Suppose I have a software company that sells word processing and spreadsheet programs. Instead of selling them separately, they sell them together as an office suite. That's bundling. If they only sell them as a bundle and not individually, that would be pure bundling. But the question doesn't specify that the products can't be bought separately, so maybe it's mixed bundling.\n\nHowever, the term \"pure price bundling\" suggests that the bundle is priced in a way that makes it attractive compared to buying the items separately, perhaps offering a discount for purchasing them together.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"pure price bundling\" refers to bundling products based solely on price advantages, without considering other marketing mix elements.\n\nI think I need to look this up to be sure, but since this is a thought process exercise, I'll proceed with my initial choice.\n\nSo, my answer is C. Pure price bundling.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
