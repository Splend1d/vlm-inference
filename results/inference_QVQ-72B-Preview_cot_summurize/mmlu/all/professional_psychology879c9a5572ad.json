                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these statements is about T-scores. I know that T-scores are a type of standardized score, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that it shows how many standard deviations a score is above or below the mean, and that a score of +1.0 means it's 1 SD above the mean. This sounds more like a z-score, which is calculated by subtracting the mean from the raw score and dividing by the standard deviation. T-scores, I think, are similar but scaled differently.\n\nOption B mentions M=50, SD=10 and that it's used on many psychological tests, specifically the MMPI. I recall that T-scores have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. The MMPI, or Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, is a psychological assessment that uses T-scores to report its results. So, this seems to align with T-scores.\n\nOption C refers to \"standard nine,\" with M=5 and SD approximately 2. I'm not as familiar with this, but I think it's a different type of scaled score, maybe used in educational testing. It doesn't match the typical T-score parameters, so probably not T-scores.\n\nOption D lists M=100 and SD=15 or 16. This reminds me of IQ scores, which often use a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 or sometimes 16, depending on the test. However, IQ tests typically use T-scores, but I think their scaling is sometimes referred to as deviation IQ scores, which are similar to T-scores but not exactly the same.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to clarify what a T-score is. T-scores are a type of standardized score that are scaled to have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. They are commonly used in psychological testing to standardize results and make them comparable across different tests and populations.\n\nGiven that definition, option B seems to directly describe T-scores: mean of 50, standard deviation of 10, and specifically mentioning their use in psychological tests like the MMPI. Option D mentions a mean of 100 and SD of 15 or 16, which is characteristic of IQ scores, not T-scores. Option A sounds like it's describing z-scores, and option C is about standard nine, which is another scaling method with different mean and SD.\n\nSo, based on this, the correct answer should be option B. But let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nI remember that in some contexts, T-scores can be scaled differently, but the standard T-score scale is indeed M=50 and SD=10. The MMPI is a well-known psychological assessment that uses this scaling, which further supports that option B is about T-scores.\n\nOption A is more about z-scores, which express how many standard deviations a score is above or below the mean, without scaling it to a specific mean and standard deviation like T-scores do.\n\nOption C, \"standard nine,\" I believe is a different scaling method, possibly used in educational settings, with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of approximately 2. This doesn't match T-scores.\n\nOption D, with M=100 and SD=15 or 16, is typical of IQ tests, which use a different scaling than T-scores, even though both are types of standardized scores.\n\nTherefore, the statement that describes T-scores is option B: M=50, SD=10- it is used on many psychological tests, MMPI.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
