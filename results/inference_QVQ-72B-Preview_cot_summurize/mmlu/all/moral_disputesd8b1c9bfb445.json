                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what Aquinas thought about the first precept of natural law. The options are:\n\nA. \"good is to be done, evil to be avoided.\"\n\nB. \"one ought to do what one will.\"\n\nC. \"one ought to do only what can be done without contradiction.\"\n\nD. \"pleasure is to be sought, pain to be avoided.\"\n\nI need to pick the one that Aquinas would agree is the first precept of natural law.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what natural law is according to Aquinas. He was a medieval philosopher and theologian who believed that natural law is a reflection of divine law, understandable through human reason. Natural law is supposed to be the basic principles that guide moral behavior.\n\nNow, the first precept should be the most fundamental principle from which all other moral rules derive. So, it's like the starting point of moral reasoning.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. \"good is to be done, evil to be avoided.\"\n\nThis seems pretty basic and intuitive. It sounds like a fundamental principle that would apply to everyone, regardless of their background or beliefs. It aligns with the idea that moral behavior involves doing what's right and avoiding what's wrong.\n\nB. \"one ought to do what one will.\"\n\nThis sounds a bit different. It seems to suggest that what you choose to do is what you ought to do. But that can't be right, because it would justify any action as long as it's what you want to do. That doesn't seem like a solid moral foundation.\n\nC. \"one ought to do only what can be done without contradiction.\"\n\nThis one is a bit confusing. It might be related to some philosophical concept about consistency in actions or ideas. But I'm not sure how it applies to natural law or morality.\n\nD. \"pleasure is to be sought, pain to be avoided.\"\n\nThis seems similar to the principle of hedonism, where pleasure is the ultimate good and pain is to be avoided. While this might be a natural inclination, it doesn't necessarily align with moral duties or obligations.\n\nGiven these options, A seems the most plausible. It's a general principle that aligns with common notions of right and wrong, and it could serve as a foundation for more specific moral rules.\n\nBut let me think deeper. In Aquinas's work, especially in the Summa Theologica, he discusses natural law and its precepts. I recall that he believed natural law is participation in the eternal law by rational creatures, and that it's knowable by reason.\n\nHe also thought that natural law has certain precepts that are self-evident truths. The first precept is indeed \"to do good and avoid evil.\" He considered this to be the fundamental principle from which all other moral norms flow.\n\nLet me cross-verify this. If I recall correctly, in the Summa Theologica, Aquinas writes: \"The first precept of the law is: to establish connatural good and to avoid connatural evil.\" And he further explains that this is a general principle that applies to all moral actions.\n\nSo, option A seems to align perfectly with Aquinas's thought.\n\nOption B, \"one ought to do what one will,\" sounds more like a principle from existentialist philosophy, perhaps something related to Jean-Paul Sartre, who emphasized individual freedom and choice. But that's definitely not Aquinas's view.\n\nOption C, \"one ought to do only what can be done without contradiction,\" might be related to some logical or metaphysical principles, but it doesn't seem directly relevant to natural law or morality.\n\nOption D, \"pleasure is to be sought, pain to be avoided,\" resonates with hedonistic philosophies, such as that of Epicurus, who believed that pleasure is the highest good. However, Aquinas was a critic of excessive pursuit of pleasure and emphasized virtue and the common good over individual gratification.\n\nTherefore, based on Aquinas's teachings, the first precept of natural law is indeed \"good is to be done, evil to be avoided.\"\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check a few more points. Aquinas believed that natural law is a participation in the reason of God, and that it's accessible to human reason. The first precept, being so fundamental, is meant to guide all moral deliberation.\n\nMoreover, in his discussion of the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments), Aquinas often refers back to this first precept as the basis for understanding the commandments.\n\nSo, I'm confident that option A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
