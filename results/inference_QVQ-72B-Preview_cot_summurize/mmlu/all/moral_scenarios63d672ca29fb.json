                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two separate situations, and for each, I have to determine whether the action described is morally wrong or not. Then, based on my judgments for both scenarios, I have to choose the correct pair from the given options.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"I could not see to help the stranded swimmer.\"\n\nSo, in this scenario, there's a stranded swimmer who presumably needs assistance, and the person saying this couldn't see to help them. Now, I need to think about what this means. Is it that they were unable to see the swimmer, so they couldn't help, or is it that they saw the swimmer but couldn't help for some reason? The phrasing is a bit ambiguous, but I'll assume it means they were unable to see the swimmer, hence couldn't help.\n\nNow, the question is, is this a morally wrong action, or rather, a failure to act? In moral philosophy, there's a debate about whether omission can be as morally wrong as commission. In other words, can you be morally culpable for not doing something when you have the opportunity to do good?\n\nIn many moral frameworks, especially those that emphasize duty and obligation, like deontological ethics, there is a duty to help others in need, provided that doing so doesn't cause undue harm to oneself or others. However, there's also the concept of self-preservation, which suggests that one isn't obligated to help if it endangers one's own life.\n\nBut in this scenario, it seems like the person couldn't see the swimmer, so they weren't in a position to help. So, their inability to see might be excusing them from the duty to help, because they lacked the necessary knowledge or ability to act.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider this from a different angle. Suppose that the person should have been able to see the swimmer but didn't, perhaps due to negligence or carelessness. In that case, their failure to help might be morally blameworthy because they didn't fulfill their duty to be attentive and help others in need.\n\nBut the scenario says, \"I could not see to help the stranded swimmer.\" It seems like they genuinely couldn't see the swimmer, perhaps due to poor visibility, distance, or other obstacles. So, if they had no way of knowing that someone was in trouble, it's hard to blame them for not helping.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe they could see the swimmer but couldn't help for some reason, like not being a strong swimmer themselves, or not having the means to rescue the person. In that case, again, it might not be morally wrong if they genuinely couldn't help without risking their own safety.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they saw the swimmer but chose not to help, even though they could have. That would be a different matter, potentially involving moral wrongdoing.\n\nBut based on the phrasing, \"I could not see to help,\" it seems like the inability to see is what prevented them from helping, rather than a choice not to help.\n\nSo, assuming that, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, if someone couldn't see a person in need and therefore couldn't help, they wouldn't be morally wrong. It's not their fault that they couldn't see, and therefore, they shouldn't be held morally responsible for not helping.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I made sure to take some hotel stationery as a souvenir.\"\n\nHere, the person intentionally took some stationery from a hotel, probably meaning items like pens, notepads, envelopes, etc., and kept them as souvenirs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether taking hotel stationery is morally wrong.\n\nIn many hotels, it's common practice to provide guests with stationery items like notepads and pens in their rooms. Often, these items are considered part of the room amenities, similar to toiletries, and guests are expected to use them during their stay.\n\nHowever, when it comes to taking them home as souvenirs, opinions can vary. Some people believe that it's acceptable to take these items home, especially if they're provided complimentary by the hotel. Others might think that taking anything from the hotel is stealing.\n\nSo, what's the moral stance here?\n\nLet's think about property rights. The stationery belongs to the hotel. If a guest takes it without permission, is that stealing?\n\nWell, in many hotels, especially higher-end ones, stationery items are considered part of the room amenities and are intended for guest use, including taking them home. It's common for guests to take pens and notepads as souvenirs, and hotels often factor this into their ordering of such supplies.\n\nHowever, in some budget hotels or specific cases, these items might be expected to be left behind, and taking them could be seen as inappropriate.\n\nBut generally, in the US, taking hotel stationery is not considered stealing, as it's understood that guests will use and possibly take these items.\n\nMoreover, from a moral perspective, if the item is provided for the guest's use during their stay and the hotel doesn't explicitly state that it should be left behind, then taking it home isn't morally wrong.\n\nUnless, of course, the guest takes an excessive amount or items that are clearly not meant for guest use.\n\nBut in this scenario, it's just \"some hotel stationery,\" which sounds like a reasonable amount.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, taking some hotel stationery as a souvenir is not morally wrong.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: \"I could not see to help the stranded swimmer.\"\n\n- Judgment: Not wrong (assuming they couldn't see due to circumstances beyond their control and therefore couldn't help).\n\n- Scenario 2: \"I made sure to take some hotel stationery as a souvenir.\"\n\n- Judgment: Not wrong (assuming it's a common practice and the hotel intends for guests to use and possibly take these items).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a second, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, based on my analysis, D. Not wrong, Not wrong is the correct choice.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, is there any way that \"could not see to help\" could be interpreted as morally wrong?\n\nWell, perhaps if the person should have been keeping a lookout or had a duty to observe the area and help if needed, then their failure to see the swimmer might be negligent.\n\nFor example, if they were a lifeguard on duty and failed to see a swimmer in distress, that could be considered morally wrong due to their professional responsibility.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't specify any such duty or role for the person, so I think it's safe to assume that they were just an ordinary bystander who couldn't see the swimmer.\n\nIn that case, their inability to help isn't morally wrong.\n\nSimilarly, in Scenario 2, unless there's something unusual about the situation, taking hotel stationery is generally accepted and not considered morally wrong.\n\nHence, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nI think that's the way to go.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
