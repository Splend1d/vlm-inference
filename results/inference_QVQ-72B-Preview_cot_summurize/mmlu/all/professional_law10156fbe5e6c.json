After searching for a vacant lot that would be sufficient for development, the developer concluded that there was not a suitable vacant lot available. Reluctantly, the developer concluded that he would have to purchase a developed lot, have the existing structures removed, and then build the apartment house. The developer was reluctant to do this, because he had not budgeted for the additional cost of buying a developed property and removing the development. After a search for an appropriate parcel, the developer purchased a large lot, developed with a single-story residential home, for $200,000. He then spent $50,000 having the residential home removed from the lot. Knowing that it would cost approximately $850,000 to build the apartment house, the developer realized he would need to raise another $100,000. He approached an investor about lending him $100,000. The investor was apprehensive about the project because the developer had not yet lined up a construction firm to build the apartment house. As a result, the parties signed the following written agreement:\"The investor promises to lend to the developer $100,000 at 5 percent interest within 30 days, provided the developer contracts with a construction company to build the apartment house for no more than $850,000. Loan to be repaid at the rate of $1,000 per month, starting one month after the completion of the apartment house. The loan is to be secured by a mortgage on the property. \"The developer then contracted with a construction company to build the apartment for $800,000. After the contract was signed and construction had begun, the developer asked the investor when he would be receiving the $100,000 the investor promised to lend him. The investor replied, \"I've changed my mind. I think this is too risky an investment. I'm not going to lend you the money. \"In an appropriate action to secure specific performance of the investor's promise to lend him the $100,000, the developer will\n\nA. win, because there is a memorandum that satisfies the Statute of Frauds.\nB. win, because land is unique, making the legal remedy inadequate.\nC. lose, because the developer's only remedy is for damages.\nD. lose, because the developer cannot show detrimental reliance.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a developer trying to build an apartment house, and there's some back and forth with an investor who was supposed to lend money. Now, the developer is considering taking legal action to get the investor to follow through with the loan promise. The question is asking whether the developer will win in an action for specific performance, and there are four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what specific performance means. Specific performance is a legal remedy where the court orders a party to fulfill their part of a contract as agreed, rather than just paying damages for not doing so. So, in this case, the developer wants the investor to give him the $100,000 loan as promised in the agreement.\n\nNow, let's look at the agreement between the developer and the investor. They had a written agreement that the investor would lend $100,000 at 5% interest within 30 days, provided that the developer contracts with a construction company to build the apartment house for no more than $850,000. The loan was to be repaid at $1,000 per month starting one month after the apartment house is completed, and it's secured by a mortgage on the property.\n\nThe developer then contracted with a construction company for $800,000, which is below the $850,000 threshold, and construction has begun. So, it seems like the developer has met the condition of finding a construction company to build for no more than $850,000.\n\nNow, the investor is backing out, saying the investment is too risky and won't lend the money. The developer wants to enforce the promise through specific performance.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. Win, because there is a memorandum that satisfies the Statute of Frauds.\n\nB. Win, because land is unique, making the legal remedy inadequate.\n\nC. Lose, because the developer's only remedy is for damages.\n\nD. Lose, because the developer cannot show detrimental reliance.\n\nFirst, option A mentions the Statute of Frauds. The Statute of Frauds generally requires that certain contracts must be in writing to be enforceable. Since there's a written agreement here, it seems to satisfy that requirement. However, just because there's a written agreement doesn't automatically mean that specific performance will be granted.\n\nOption B says that the developer will win because land is unique and legal remedies are inadequate. This is a common reason for granting specific performance in real estate transactions. But in this case, the dispute is about a loan agreement, not directly about the transfer of land. So, while the loan is secured by a mortgage on the property, the specific performance is sought for the loan, not for the property itself. So, I'm not sure if this directly applies here.\n\nOption C says the developer will lose because the only remedy is for damages. Damages are monetary compensation for losses due to a breach of contract. Specific performance is typically granted when damages are not sufficient to compensate the injured party. So, if the court believes that damages are adequate, they might deny specific performance.\n\nOption D says the developer will lose because they cannot show detrimental reliance. Detrimental reliance, also known as promissory estoppel, is when one party reasonably relies on the promise of another to their detriment. If the developer took actions based on the investor's promise, and suffered a loss as a result, they might be able to claim promissory estoppel. However, in this scenario, the parties had a written agreement, so it might be more straightforwardly a contract dispute rather than a promissory estoppel claim.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. The agreement between the developer and the investor is a loan agreement with certain conditions. The developer has met the condition of contracting with a construction company for within the specified budget. Therefore, it seems like the developer has satisfied the condition for the loan.\n\nHowever, the investor is now refusing to lend the money, citing riskiness of the investment. The developer wants specific performance to enforce the loan agreement.\n\nIn general, specific performance is an equitable remedy that courts may grant when money damages are insufficient. In the case of loan agreements, it's less common to grant specific performance because the lender can always provide the money, and damages can be calculated based on the interest that would have been paid or other financial losses.\n\nBut, in some cases, if the loan is essential for the project to proceed and without it, the entire project might fail, causing greater harm than just the amount of the loan, the court might consider specific performance.\n\nIn this scenario, the loan is necessary for the developer to complete the apartment house. Without the loan, the developer might not have enough funds to finish the project, which could lead to significant losses.\n\nHowever, typically, in loan agreements, the remedy is damages, meaning the developer could sue for the lost interest or other financial consequences of the breach.\n\nBut, considering that the loan is secured by a mortgage on the property, and the property is involved, there might be an argument that the developer needs the loan to secure the property and proceed with the project.\n\nWait, but the property has already been purchased; the developer bought a lot for $200,000 and spent $50,000 to remove an existing structure. So, the developer has already invested $250,000 plus the $800,000 contract with the construction company, totaling $1,050,000. The developer initially had $1 million, so they needed an additional $100,000, which is the loan from the investor.\n\nIf the investor doesn't provide the $100,000, the developer might not be able to complete the project, leading to potential losses on the investment already made.\n\nSo, in this context, damages might not fully compensate the developer for the loss of the loan, especially if the developer cannot find another lender quickly or at similar terms.\n\nTherefore, the court might consider specific performance to ensure the project can proceed as planned.\n\nBut, on the other hand, the investor might argue that they have the right to assess the risk and change their mind, especially if they believe the project is too risky.\n\nHowever, they did enter into a written agreement promising to lend the money under certain conditions, which the developer has met.\n\nSo, unless there's some other reason, the investor is bound by the agreement.\n\nGiven that, the developer should be able to enforce the agreement through specific performance.\n\nMoreover, since the agreement is in writing and satisfies the Statute of Frauds, as per option A, that strengthens the developer's position.\n\nOption B mentions that land is unique, which is true, but again, the dispute is about the loan, not the transfer of the property.\n\nOption C says the developer will lose because only damages are available, but in this case, damages might not adequately compensate for the loss of the loan and the potential failure of the project.\n\nOption D says the developer cannot show detrimental reliance, but since there's a written agreement, the developer might not need to rely on promissory estoppel.\n\nGiven all this, I think the developer will win and be granted specific performance.\n\nSo, the answer is A. win, because there is a memorandum that satisfies the Statute of Frauds.\n\nBut, to be honest, I'm a bit torn because while the written agreement is important, the key point seems to be that the developer has met the conditions for the loan, and the investor is backing out despite the agreement.\n\nMaybe the correct answer is A, but I feel like there's more to it.\n\nWait, perhaps the best answer is A, since the existence of the written agreement satisfying the Statute of Frauds makes the contract enforceable, and thus specific performance can be granted.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the developer will win because there is a memorandum that satisfies the Statute of Frauds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
