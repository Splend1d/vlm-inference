                    "text": "Let's see. I have this case of a 17-year-old girl who's been having some issues with coughing and nasal congestion during exercise. She plays field hockey and notices that when she's running up and down the field, she starts coughing. The cough goes away when she rests, and she doesn't produce any phlegm. She also mentions that she hasn't had any chest pain or palpitations. She doesn't smoke, which is good, and she's not taking any medications. Her sister has asthma, which might be relevant.\n\nSo, she comes to the doctor because of this 2-month history of exercise-induced cough and nasal congestion. The doctor checks her out, and she looks healthy. Her vital signs are all normal: pulse is 68 beats per minute, respirations are 16 per minute, and blood pressure is 100 over 75 mm Hg. Her oxygen saturation on room air is 99%, which is excellent.\n\nDuring the physical exam, the doctor listens to her heart and lungs and doesn't hear anything abnormal. That's reassuring. They also take an X-ray of her chest, and it looks normal too. So, no signs of infection or other problems there.\n\nThen, they do some spirometry tests to check her lung function. The FEV1:FVC ratio is 90%, which is within normal limits, and her FEV1 is 90% of what's predicted for her age and height. That suggests that her lung function is pretty good and doesn't indicate any obstruction or restriction.\n\nNow, the question is, what's the most likely diagnosis given these symptoms and findings?\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\nA. Asthma\n\nB. Chronic bronchitis\n\nC. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n\nD. Postnasal drip syndrome\n\nLet's go through each one.\n\nFirst, asthma. I know that asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways that causes recurring periods of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing, especially at night or early in the morning. But in this case, the patient doesn't report any wheezing, breathlessness, or chest tightness. Her cough is only during exercise and resolves with rest. Also, her spirometry tests are normal, which might make me think less about asthma, but I know that sometimes asthma can be exercise-induced, and spirometry might be normal at rest.\n\nWait, maybe exercise-induced bronchospasm could be a possibility. That's a type of asthma that's triggered by exercise. But again, her spirometry is normal, and she doesn't have any symptoms at rest.\n\nLet me think about chronic bronchitis next. That's usually defined by a productive cough that lasts for at least three months in two consecutive years. But in this case, the patient's cough is nonproductive and only occurs during exercise. So, that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can cause a variety of symptoms, including heartburn, acid reflux, and sometimes a chronic cough. But she doesn't report any heartburn or acid reflux symptoms. Her cough is only during exercise, which doesn't seem directly related to GERD. Maybe it's possible, but it doesn't seem like the most likely diagnosis.\n\nNow, postnasal drip syndrome. This is where excess mucus drips from the nasal passages into the throat, causing a sensation of phlegm or mucus in the back of the throat, which can lead to coughing. She does mention nasal congestion during exercise, which could be related to postnasal drip. Maybe her nasal passages produce more mucus during exercise, leading to postnasal drip and coughing.\n\nBut, I need to consider if this is the most likely diagnosis. Let's see if there's any connection between exercise and postnasal drip.\n\nI recall that during exercise, especially in cold or dry air, the nasal passages can produce more mucus as a protective mechanism. So, it's possible that her nasal congestion and postnasal drip are exacerbated by exercise, leading to the coughing.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit torn because her sister has asthma, and there might be a genetic component there. Maybe she has undiagnosed asthma that's being triggered by exercise.\n\nBut her spirometry is normal, which makes me think less about asthma. Maybe she needs a more specific test for exercise-induced bronchospasm, like a methacholine challenge test or a specific exercise test, but that's not mentioned here.\n\nGiven the information provided, her symptoms are primarily during exercise and involve coughing and nasal congestion. Her lung function tests are normal, and she has no other respiratory symptoms.\n\nI need to think about whether postnasal drip syndrome could be the primary cause of her symptoms. It seems plausible, especially since she has nasal congestion during exercise, which could lead to postnasal drip and coughing.\n\nOn the other hand, exercise-induced asthma can present with isolated cough without other symptoms, but her spirometry is normal, which might make that less likely.\n\nChronic bronchitis seems unlikely given her age, lack of smoking history, and absence of a productive cough.\n\nGERD doesn't seem to fit well because her symptoms are exercise-induced and don't involve typical GERD symptoms like heartburn or acid reflux.\n\nSo, between the options given, postnasal drip syndrome seems like the most likely diagnosis based on her symptoms and the physical exam findings.\n\nBut, I should consider if there's any possibility of another condition. For example, exercise-induced laryngospasm could cause coughing during exercise, but that's less common and might not be the first diagnosis to consider.\n\nAlso, allergic rhinitis could cause postnasal drip and nasal congestion, and exercise can sometimes exacerbate these symptoms, especially if there are allergens in the environment where she plays field hockey.\n\nGiven all that, I think postnasal drip syndrome is the most likely diagnosis in this case.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD"
