                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this logic puzzle here. It's about identifying a specific type of fallacy based on the description provided. The question says: \"When a claim is supported only by asserting that unidentified experts accept the claim, the arguer has committed which of the following fallacies?\"\n\nOkay, so let's break this down. There's a claim being made, and the only evidence provided is that some unknown experts agree with it. The problem is that these experts are not identified, which seems sketchy because we don't know who they are or what their credentials really are. This kind of approach can be problematic in logical arguments because it relies on authority without providing verifiable sources.\n\nNow, I need to match this scenario with the correct term from the options given:\n\nA. Appeal to tradition\n\nB. Ad vericundiam\n\nC. Appeal to anonymous authority\n\nD. Snob appeal\n\nLet me go through each one to understand what they mean and see which one fits the description.\n\nStarting with option A: appeal to tradition. From what I recall, this is a fallacy where something is considered good or correct just because it's been done that way for a long time. Like, \"We've always done it this way, so it must be right.\" But in this case, the argument isn't about tradition or long-standing practices; it's about unspecified experts agreeing with a claim. So, this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nNext, option B: ad vericundiam. I think this is a type of appeal to authority fallacy where the argument is based on the supposed expertise or reputation of a person, rather than the merits of the claim itself. For example, if someone famous says something must be true because they're famous, that's ad vericundiam. However, in the scenario described, it's not about the reputation of the expert but about the fact that the experts are anonymous. So, while related, this doesn't seem exactly right.\n\nOption C: appeal to anonymous authority. This sounds very much like the situation described. Here, an argument is based on the authority of experts whose identities and credentials are not disclosed. The problem with this is that there's no way to verify the expertise or credibility of these authorities. They might not even exist, or they might not be qualified in the relevant field. So, this seems like a strong candidate for the correct answer.\n\nLastly, option D: snob appeal. I'm not as familiar with this term in the context of logical fallacies. Snob appeal often refers to marketing strategies that associate a product with exclusivity or high social status to make it more attractive to buyers. It's about appealing to people's desires to be seen as elite or sophisticated. This doesn't directly relate to supporting a claim with unidentified experts, so it probably isn't the right choice here.\n\nAfter considering all the options, I believe that \"appeal to anonymous authority\" is the most appropriate description for the fallacy being referred to in the question. It directly matches the scenario where a claim is supported by referencing experts whose identities and qualifications are not provided, thereby making the argument unreliable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. appeal to anonymous authority}} \\]"
