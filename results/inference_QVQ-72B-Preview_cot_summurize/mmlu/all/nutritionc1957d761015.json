High fatigue resistance\n\nC. High motor unit strength\n\nD. Fast contractile speed\n\nFirst, I need to recall what type IIb muscle fibers are known for. I remember that muscle fibers are generally classified into two main types: type I and type II. Type I fibers are slow-twitch and are great for endurance activities because they're resistant to fatigue. Type II fibers are fast-twitch and are better suited for activities that require quick bursts of strength or speed.\n\nWithin type II fibers, there are subtypes: IIa and IIb. Type IIa fibers are sometimes called \"fast oxidative\" because they have both speed and some oxidative capacity, making them somewhat fatigue-resistant. Type IIb fibers, on the other hand, are \"fast glycolytic,\" meaning they're designed for speed and power but have less oxidative capacity, so they fatigue more quickly.\n\nSo, based on that, let's look at the options again:\n\nA. Low oxidative capacity \u2013 Since type IIb fibers are fast glycolytic, they have a lower oxidative capacity compared to type IIa or type I fibers. So, this seems to be a characteristic of type IIb fibers.\n\nB. High fatigue resistance \u2013 Given that they have low oxidative capacity, they should fatigue more quickly, right? So, high fatigue resistance doesn't seem to align with what I know about type IIb fibers.\n\nC. High motor unit strength \u2013 Type IIb fibers are known for their strength and power production, so this should be a characteristic of them.\n\nD. Fast contractile speed \u2013 As fast-twitch fibers, type IIb should have a fast contractile speed.\n\nFrom this, it seems like option B (high fatigue resistance) is not representative of type IIb muscle fibers. Instead, they are more prone to fatigue due to their lower oxidative capacity.\n\nLet me double-check this information to make sure I'm not missing something. I found that type IIb fibers are fast glycolytic, meaning they rely more on anaerobic metabolism, which produces lactate and can lead to muscle fatigue. Type IIa fibers, which have both oxidative and glycolytic capabilities, are more fatigue-resistant.\n\nTherefore, high fatigue resistance is not a characteristic of type IIb fibers.\n\nI think the answer is B. High fatigue resistance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
