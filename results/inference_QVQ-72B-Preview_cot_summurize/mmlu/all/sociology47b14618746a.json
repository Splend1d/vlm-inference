It says that children who are still sucking their thumbs when they enter kindergarten are often subject to teasing and ridicule for this behavior. And it asks what type of social sanction is applied in this instance. The options are:\n\nA. Formal positive sanction\n\nB. Formal negative sanction\n\nC. Informal positive sanction\n\nD. Informal negative sanction\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what a social sanction is. From what I remember in sociology class, a social sanction is a consequence\u2014either reward or punishment\u2014that is applied to enforce conformity to social norms and values. So, it's a way society controls behavior by praising or punishing actions.\n\nNow, there are different types of social sanctions based on whether they are formal or informal, and whether they are positive or negative.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Formal vs. Informal:\n\n- Formal sanctions are official and organized, often involving institutions like schools, courts, or governments. Examples include fines, awards, or certificates.\n\n- Informal sanctions are unofficial and occur in everyday interactions between people. Examples include compliments, gossip, or teasing.\n\n2. Positive vs. Negative:\n\n- Positive sanctions are rewards for conforming to social norms, like praise, awards, or approval.\n\n- Negative sanctions are punishments for deviating from social norms, like criticism, ridicule, or ostracism.\n\nGiven that, the scenario here involves children teasing and ridiculing other children for thumb-sucking in kindergarten. So, let's see which category this falls into.\n\nFirst, is it formal or informal? Well, teasing among children in kindergarten is not an official school policy or rule; it's more of a peer reaction. So, it seems like an informal sanction because it's happening through everyday social interactions, not through official channels.\n\nNext, is it positive or negative? Teasing and ridicule sound like negative actions because they are meant to shame or embarrass someone for doing something that is considered inappropriate. So, this would be a negative sanction because it's a punishment for not conforming to the expected behavior.\n\nPutting it together, it should be an informal negative sanction.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Formal positive sanction would be something like getting an award for good behavior, which isn't the case here. Formal negative sanction might be getting a detention or reprimand from a teacher for misbehaving, which isn't directly mentioned. Informal positive sanction could be getting praised by peers for doing something right, but again, that's not what's happening here.\n\nThe scenario clearly describes children being teased and ridiculed by their peers for thumb-sucking, which is an informal way of saying \"this behavior is not acceptable.\" So, this fits perfectly with an informal negative sanction.\n\nI think the answer is D. Informal negative sanction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
