                    "text": "So I've got this question here about our body's natural defense against free radicals. The options are AFR, SOD, Vitamin C, and Telomerase. I need to pick the one that's referred to as our built-in defense against free radicals.\n\nFirst off, I should probably understand what free radicals are. From what I recall, free radicals are unstable molecules that can damage cells, leading to aging and diseases. So, our body has ways to combat these free radicals, and this question is about identifying which one of these options is a natural defense mechanism against them.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A is AFR. I'm not too familiar with this abbreviation. Let me think... AFR might stand for something, but I don't remember it off the top of my head. Maybe it's not the right choice.\n\nOption B is SOD, which I believe stands for Superoxide Dismutase. I've heard of this enzyme before. I think it's involved in breaking down superoxide, which is a type of free radical. So, if SOD helps to break down free radicals, it makes sense that it would be part of our body's natural defense against them.\n\nOption C is Vitamin C. I know that Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant, and antioxidants are known for neutralizing free radicals. So, Vitamin C definitely plays a role in protecting our cells from free radical damage. But is it considered a built-in defense? Well, Vitamin C is something we get from our diet, primarily from fruits and vegetables. While it's essential for our health, I'm not sure if it's considered a natural, built-in defense in the same way that enzymes like SOD are.\n\nOption D is Telomerase. I know that telomerase is an enzyme that helps maintain telomeres, which are the protective caps at the ends of our chromosomes. Telomeres shorten as we age, and telomerase helps to prevent this shortening. While telomerase is important for cellular aging, I don't directly associate it with defending against free radicals.\n\nSo, comparing these options:\n\n- AFR: I don't know what it is, so it's probably not the right choice.\n\n- SOD: This is an enzyme that breaks down free radicals, making it a direct part of our natural defense system against them.\n\n- Vitamin C: While it's an important antioxidant, it's obtained from diet and not inherently produced by our bodies in the same way that enzymes like SOD are.\n\n- Telomerase: This enzyme is more related to aging and maintaining chromosomal integrity rather than directly fighting free radicals.\n\nGiven this information, SOD seems like the most appropriate answer. It's a naturally occurring enzyme in our bodies that specifically targets and breaks down free radicals, acting as a built-in defense mechanism.\n\nJust to double-check, I recall that SOD is actually one of the primary antioxidant enzymes in our bodies, converting superoxide radicals into less harmful molecules like hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. This definitely aligns with the concept of a natural, built-in defense against free radicals.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. SOD.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
