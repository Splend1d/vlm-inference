                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I passed by a cow, and fed it some grass.\" Hmm, feeding a cow grass seems pretty harmless. Cows eat grass, right? It's their natural food source. I don't see anything wrong with that. But maybe there are some considerations I'm missing. Is there any chance that feeding a cow grass could be harmful? Well, if the grass is poisoned or something, but assuming it's safe grass, it should be fine. So, I think this is \"not wrong.\"\n\nSecond scenario: \"I gave the sick child two Advil for her fever.\" Okay, this is a bit more complicated. Advil is ibuprofen, which is a common pain reliever and fever reducer. It's often used for children. But, I need to consider if it's appropriate in this situation. If the child is sick and has a fever, giving her Advil could be helpful to reduce the fever. However, I should think about whether I have the knowledge to administer medication correctly. Do I know the child's medical history? Could there be any allergies or interactions with other medications? Also, what about the age and weight of the child? The dosage for Advil can vary based on the child's weight and age.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I shouldn't be giving medication without knowing these details. It could be dangerous if I give the wrong dosage or if the child has an allergy to ibuprofen. Plus, perhaps the child is taking other medications that could interact with Advil. In that case, it could be harmful.\n\nOn the other hand, if I know the child well, and I'm familiar with their medical history and current medications, and I'm giving the correct dosage, then it might be okay. But, in the scenario, it just says \"I gave the sick child two Advil for her fever.\" It doesn't provide any context about whether I know the child's medical history or not.\n\nGiven that, I think it's risky to give medication without knowing all the necessary information. It's generally not a good idea to give medicine to someone else's child without being sure about the dosages and potential interactions. So, in this case, I would say it's \"wrong\" because of the potential harm that could be caused by improper medication administration.\n\nPutting it all together, scenario 1 is \"not wrong\" and scenario 2 is \"wrong.\" So, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it. For example, perhaps in scenario 1, the cow could be on a specific diet, and feeding it grass could disrupt that diet. Or maybe the cow is in a protected area where feeding is not allowed. But, again, assuming it's a normal situation with no special restrictions, feeding a cow grass seems fine.\n\nIn scenario 2, even if the child needs fever reduction, it's important to consider the safety and appropriateness of giving medication. Without knowing the child's specific circumstances, it's not responsible to administer Advil. So, yeah, I think my initial assessment is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
