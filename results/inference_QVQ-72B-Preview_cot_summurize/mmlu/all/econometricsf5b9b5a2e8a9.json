                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this Durbin-Watson statistic and how it relates to the first-order autocorrelation coefficient. The question says that if the Durbin Watson statistic is close to zero, what does that imply about the autocorrelation coefficient? The options are:\n\nA. Close to zero\n\nB. Close to plus one\n\nC. Close to minus one\n\nD. Close to either minus one or plus one\n\nAlright, let's start by recalling what the Durbin Watson statistic measures. I know that it's used in regression analysis to detect the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals from a regression model. Specifically, it tests for first-order autocorrelation.\n\nThe formula for the Durbin Watson statistic is:\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{\\sum_{t=2}^{T} (e_t - e_{t-1})^2}{\\sum_{t=1}^{T} e_t^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( e_t \\) are the residuals from the regression.\n\nThe value of \\( d \\) can range from 0 to 4. Generally, the rule of thumb is:\n\n- If \\( d \\) is close to 2, there is no autocorrelation.\n\n- If \\( d \\) is less than 2, there might be positive autocorrelation.\n\n- If \\( d \\) is greater than 2, there might be negative autocorrelation.\n\nBut in this question, \\( d \\) is close to zero. So, what does that imply about the autocorrelation coefficient, which I believe is the first-order autocorrelation coefficient \\( \\rho_1 \\)?\n\nLet me think about the properties of the Durbin Watson statistic. When \\( d \\) is close to zero, it means that the numerator is small compared to the denominator. The numerator is the sum of squared differences between consecutive residuals, and the denominator is the sum of squared residuals.\n\nIf \\( d \\) is close to zero, that means the differences between consecutive residuals are very small, almost zero. This suggests that consecutive residuals are very similar to each other.\n\nNow, the first-order autocorrelation coefficient \\( \\rho_1 \\) measures the correlation between \\( e_t \\) and \\( e_{t-1} \\). If consecutive residuals are very similar, that would imply a high positive correlation between them, meaning \\( \\rho_1 \\) is close to +1.\n\nLet me double-check this reasoning. If \\( \\rho_1 \\) is close to +1, it means that if one residual is above average, the next one is likely to be above average as well, and vice versa. This would lead to small differences between consecutive residuals, which would make the Durbin Watson statistic small, possibly close to zero.\n\nOn the other hand, if \\( \\rho_1 \\) were close to -1, we would expect that if one residual is above average, the next one is likely to be below average, leading to larger differences between consecutive residuals, and thus a larger Durbin Watson statistic, possibly close to 4.\n\nSo, based on this, if \\( d \\) is close to zero, it's indicating strong positive autocorrelation, meaning \\( \\rho_1 \\) is close to +1.\n\nLet me consider the extreme case where \\( \\rho_1 = 1 \\). In that case, \\( e_t = e_{t-1} \\) for all \\( t \\), so the differences \\( e_t - e_{t-1} = 0 \\), making the numerator of \\( d \\) zero, and thus \\( d = 0 \\).\n\nConversely, if \\( \\rho_1 = 0 \\), the residuals are uncorrelated, and \\( d \\) should be around 2.\n\nIf \\( \\rho_1 \\) is negative, say close to -1, then the differences \\( e_t - e_{t-1} \\) would be larger, leading to a larger \\( d \\), possibly close to 4.\n\nTherefore, a Durbin Watson statistic close to zero suggests that \\( \\rho_1 \\) is close to +1.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Close to plus one.\n\nJust to make sure, let's look back at the options:\n\nA. Close to zero \u2013 no, that wouldn't align with a Durbin Watson statistic close to zero.\n\nB. Close to plus one \u2013 yes, this matches our reasoning.\n\nC. Close to minus one \u2013 this would typically correspond to a Durbin Watson statistic close to 4, not zero.\n\nD. Close to either minus one or plus one \u2013 no, because a Durbin Watson statistic close to zero specifically indicates positive autocorrelation, not negative.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. Close to plus one.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
