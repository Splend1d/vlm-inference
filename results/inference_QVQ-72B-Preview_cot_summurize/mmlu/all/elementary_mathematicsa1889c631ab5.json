                    "text": "So I have this problem here: Malik has 240 CDs, and he sorted them into 12 equal groups. I need to find out which expression shows how to find the number of CDs in each group. The options are:\n\nA. 240 \u00f7 12\n\nB. 240 \u2013 12\n\nC. 240 + 12\n\nD. 240 \u00d7 12\n\nOkay, let's think about this. Malik has 240 CDs, and he wants to split them into 12 groups that are all the same size. So, I need to figure out how many CDs are in each group.\n\nHmm, division seems relevant here because division is about splitting something into equal parts. So, if I have 240 CDs and 12 groups, I should divide 240 by 12 to find out how many CDs are in each group.\n\nLet me see what 240 divided by 12 is. 240 \u00f7 12 = 20. So, each group would have 20 CDs.\n\nNow, let's consider the other options to make sure they don't make sense in this context.\n\nOption B is 240 \u2013 12. That would be subtracting 12 from 240, which would give me 228. But that doesn't seem to relate to finding the number of CDs in each group. It's just subtracting 12 from the total, which doesn't help with dividing the CDs into groups.\n\nOption C is 240 + 12. That would be adding 12 to 240, giving me 252. Again, this doesn't help me find out how many CDs are in each group. It's just increasing the total number of CDs by 12.\n\nOption D is 240 \u00d7 12. That would be multiplying 240 by 12, which equals 2,880. This would be the total if I had 12 groups of 240 CDs each, but that's not what's being asked. I'm supposed to find the number of CDs in each group when the total is divided into 12 equal groups.\n\nSo, clearly, the correct expression is A. 240 \u00f7 12.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check my understanding. Is there any other way to interpret \"sorted them into 12 equal groups\"?\n\nWell, sometimes, when people sort items into groups, they might not necessarily mean equal groups, but in this case, the problem specifically says \"equal groups.\" So, division is definitely the way to go.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use fractions. If I have 240 CDs and 12 groups, each group gets 1/12 of the total CDs. So, yes, that's also 240 multiplied by 1/12, which is the same as 240 \u00f7 12.\n\nAlternatively, I could use repeated subtraction. Starting with 240 and subtracting 12 until I reach zero, counting how many times I subtracted 12. But that seems inefficient for this problem.\n\nOr, I could use multiplication to check. Since I know that 12 times 20 is 240, that confirms that each group has 20 CDs.\n\nLet me consider if there's any trick here. Maybe the question is testing whether I understand that division is the operation to use when splitting into equal groups.\n\nBut no, the question is straightforward: it's about dividing the total number of CDs into a certain number of equal groups. So, the expression should be total divided by number of groups, which is 240 \u00f7 12.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll eliminate the other options one by one.\n\nOption B: 240 \u2013 12 = 228. This doesn't represent the number of CDs in each group. It just reduces the total by 12, which isn't relevant here.\n\nOption C: 240 + 12 = 252. Again, this increases the total but doesn't help in finding the number of CDs per group.\n\nOption D: 240 \u00d7 12 = 2,880. This would be the total if each of the 12 groups had 240 CDs, but that's not what's being asked. The problem is about dividing the total into 12 equal groups.\n\nTherefore, the only correct expression is A. 240 \u00f7 12.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and I'm confident that this is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 240 \\div 12} \\]"
