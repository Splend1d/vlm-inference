                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem where A is the set {1, 2, 3}, and there's a relation S on A defined as S = {(1,1), (2,2)}. And I need to figure out what kind of relation this is from the given options: symmetric only, anti-symmetric only, both symmetric and anti-symmetric, or an equivalence relation.\n\nFirst, I should recall what each of these terms means in the context of relations.\n\n1. **Symmetric Relation**: A relation S on a set A is symmetric if for every pair (a, b) in S, the pair (b, a) is also in S.\n\n2. **Anti-symmetric Relation**: A relation S on a set A is anti-symmetric if for every pair (a, b) and (b, a) in S, it implies that a = b.\n\n3. **Equivalence Relation**: A relation S on a set A is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.\n\nGiven that, let's analyze the relation S = {(1,1), (2,2)} on the set A = {1,2,3}.\n\n**Step 1: Check for Symmetry**\n\nFor symmetry, we need to see if for every (a, b) in S, (b, a) is also in S.\n\nLooking at S, we have (1,1) and (2,2). For these pairs, since a = b in both cases, (b, a) is indeed the same as (a, b). So, symmetry seems to hold because for (1,1), (1,1) is present, and for (2,2), (2,2) is present.\n\nWait, but what about pairs where a \u2260 b? For example, is there any (a, b) where a \u2260 b in S? In this case, S only contains pairs where a = b, so there are no pairs where a \u2260 b. Therefore, the condition for symmetry is vacuously true because there are no counterexamples.\n\nSo, S is symmetric.\n\n**Step 2: Check for Anti-symmetry**\n\nFor anti-symmetry, we need to see if for every (a, b) and (b, a) in S, it implies that a = b.\n\nLooking at S again: {(1,1), (2,2)}, we see that whenever (a, b) is in S, (b, a) is also in S, and a = b in these cases. Therefore, anti-symmetry holds.\n\nSo, S is anti-symmetric.\n\n**Step 3: Check for Equivalence Relation**\n\nFor S to be an equivalence relation, it must be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.\n\n- **Reflexivity**: For every a in A, (a, a) should be in S.\n\nLooking at A = {1,2,3}, S contains (1,1) and (2,2), but not (3,3). Therefore, S is not reflexive because (3,3) is missing. Since reflexivity is not satisfied, S cannot be an equivalence relation.\n\n- **Transitivity**: For every (a, b) and (b, c) in S, (a, c) should also be in S.\n\nLooking at S: {(1,1), (2,2)}, there are no pairs where a \u2260 b, so there are no (a, b) and (b, c) to check for transitivity. Therefore, transitivity is vacuously true, but since reflexivity is not satisfied, S is not an equivalence relation.\n\n**Conclusion so far**\n\nS is symmetric and anti-symmetric, but not an equivalence relation because it's not reflexive.\n\n**Additional Consideration**\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. symmetric only\n\nB. anti-symmetric only\n\nC. both symmetric and anti-symmetric\n\nD. an equivalence relation\n\nSince we've determined that S is both symmetric and anti-symmetric, but not an equivalence relation, option C seems to be the correct choice.\n\nHowever, I should double-check if a relation can be both symmetric and anti-symmetric.\n\n**Double-checking Symmetry and Anti-symmetry**\n\nA relation is symmetric if whenever (a, b) is in S, so is (b, a).\n\nA relation is anti-symmetric if whenever (a, b) and (b, a) are in S, then a = b.\n\nIn the case where S contains only pairs where a = b, like {(1,1), (2,2)}, both properties hold because:\n\n- For symmetry: (a, a) is in S, so (a, a) is also in S.\n\n- For anti-symmetry: the only possible pairs are those where a = b, so the condition is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, it's acceptable for a relation to be both symmetric and anti-symmetric under these circumstances.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
