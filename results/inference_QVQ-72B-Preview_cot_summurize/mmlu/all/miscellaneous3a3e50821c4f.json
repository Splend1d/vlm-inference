                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"What French city is home to a famous international film festival each spring?\" And the options are A. Cannes, B. Marseille, C. Dijon, and D. Lyon. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these cities hosts a famous international film festival every spring.\n\nFirst off, I know that France is known for its cinema and film festivals. The most famous one that comes to mind is the Cannes Film Festival. But let me make sure about the details.\n\nCannes is a city on the French Riviera, and I think it's where the big film festival happens every year. Usually, it's in May, which is springtime. So, that seems to fit the description.\n\nMarseille is another city in France, closer to the south as well, but I don't recall it hosting a major international film festival. It's more known for being a port city and having a rich cultural scene, but not specifically for a film festival.\n\nDijon is further inland, in the Burgundy region. It's more famous for its cuisine and historic architecture. I don't think there's a prominent film festival there.\n\nLyon is also inland, known for its culinary traditions and historical sites. While it does have some cultural events, I don't remember it hosting a major international film festival.\n\nSo, based on what I know, Cannes seems like the most plausible answer. But just to be sure, maybe I should think about it a bit more.\n\nThe Cannes Film Festival is officially called the Festival de Cannes and is one of the oldest and most prestigious film festivals. It's held annually in Cannes, France, and attracts filmmakers, celebrities, and media from around the world. It's a big deal in the film industry.\n\nNow, just to double-check, maybe I should consider if there are any other film festivals in France that are equally famous or held in different cities.\n\nThere is the Deauville American Film Festival, which takes place in Deauville, but that's in autumn, not spring. So, that doesn't match the timing mentioned in the question.\n\nThe Paris Film Festival exists, but it's not as renowned as the Cannes Film Festival. Moreover, it's held in June, which is still spring, but again, Cannes is more famous.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should consider that there might be other significant film festivals in France that I'm not as familiar with. But the question specifies a \"famous international film festival each spring,\" and Cannes is the first one that comes to mind.\n\nLet me think about the significance of each city in terms of film festivals:\n\n- Cannes: World-renowned for its film festival.\n\n- Marseille: Known for being a major port and having a vibrant cultural scene, but not specifically for a film festival.\n\n- Dijon: Known for its historical importance and food, not films.\n\n- Lyon: Famous for its cuisine and historical architecture, again, not particularly associated with a major film festival.\n\nGiven this, it seems pretty clear that Cannes is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any possibility of a new festival rising in prominence that I might not be aware of. However, the question mentions a \"famous\" international film festival, and Cannes is by far the most well-known in that context.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the correct answer is A. Cannes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A. Cannes}} \\]"
