                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. There's a cannon on a truck that's moving forward at 5 m/s, and the cannon can shoot a ball with a muzzle velocity of 50 m/s. The goal is to launch the ball so that it goes as far as possible before hitting the ground, and I need to find out at what angle the cannon should be pointed from the horizontal.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand the situation. The truck is moving forward at 5 m/s, and the cannon is mounted on it. So, the cannon has an initial horizontal velocity due to the truck's movement, right? Then, when the cannon fires, it adds its own muzzle velocity to the ball's velocity.\n\nWait, actually, I think I need to consider the cannon's velocity relative to the truck. But since the cannon is mounted on the truck, their velocities are the same. So, the ball is being launched from a moving platform.\n\nLet me think about the components of the velocity. The truck is moving at 5 m/s horizontally. The cannon is firing the ball at 50 m/s at an angle \u03b8 from the horizontal. So, the ball's velocity relative to the ground should be the vector sum of the truck's velocity and the cannon's muzzle velocity.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- \\(v_{\\text{truck}} = 5 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) (horizontal)\n\n- \\(v_{\\text{muzzle}} = 50 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) at an angle \u03b8 from the horizontal\n\nSo, the ball's horizontal component of velocity relative to the ground is:\n\n\\[v_{\\text{x}} = v_{\\text{truck}} + v_{\\text{muzzle}} \\cos \\theta = 5 + 50 \\cos \\theta \\, \\text{m/s}\\]\n\nThe vertical component is:\n\n\\[v_{\\text{y}} = v_{\\text{muzzle}} \\sin \\theta = 50 \\sin \\theta \\, \\text{m/s}\\]\n\nNow, I need to find the range of the projectile, which is the horizontal distance it travels before hitting the ground. For a projectile launched from an initial height of zero, the range \\(R\\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[R = \\frac{v^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g}\\]\n\nBut in this case, the cannon is moving horizontally, so I think I need to adjust this formula to account for the horizontal velocity of the truck.\n\nWait, actually, in the standard range formula, \\(v\\) is the initial velocity of the projectile relative to the ground. So, in this case, the initial velocity of the ball relative to the ground is the vector sum of the truck's velocity and the cannon's muzzle velocity.\n\nSo, the horizontal component of the velocity is \\(v_{\\text{x}} = 5 + 50 \\cos \\theta\\), and the vertical component is \\(v_{\\text{y}} = 50 \\sin \\theta\\).\n\nThe range \\(R\\) can be found by considering the time of flight \\(t\\), which is determined by the vertical motion.\n\nThe time of flight is given by:\n\n\\[t = \\frac{2 v_{\\text{y}}}{g} = \\frac{2 \\times 50 \\sin \\theta}{9.81}\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[t = \\frac{100 \\sin \\theta}{9.81}\\]\n\nThen, the range is:\n\n\\[R = v_{\\text{x}} \\times t = (5 + 50 \\cos \\theta) \\times \\frac{100 \\sin \\theta}{9.81}\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[R = \\frac{100 (5 + 50 \\cos \\theta) \\sin \\theta}{9.81}\\]\n\nI need to maximize \\(R\\) with respect to \u03b8.\n\nLet me write \\(R\\) in terms of \u03b8:\n\n\\[R(\\theta) = \\frac{100}{9.81} \\times (5 \\sin \\theta + 50 \\cos \\theta \\sin \\theta)\\]\n\nI can factor out the constants:\n\n\\[R(\\theta) = \\frac{100}{9.81} \\times \\left(5 \\sin \\theta + 50 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\sin 2\\theta\\right)\\]\n\nWait, actually, \\(\\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\sin 2\\theta\\), so:\n\n\\[R(\\theta) = \\frac{100}{9.81} \\times \\left(5 \\sin \\theta + 25 \\sin 2\\theta\\right)\\]\n\nNow, to find the angle \u03b8 that maximizes \\(R\\), I can take the derivative of \\(R\\) with respect to \u03b8 and set it to zero.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\\frac{dR}{d\\theta} = \\frac{100}{9.81} \\times \\left(5 \\cos \\theta + 25 \\times 2 \\cos 2\\theta\\right)\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\\frac{dR}{d\\theta} = \\frac{100}{9.81} \\times (5 \\cos \\theta + 50 \\cos 2\\theta)\\]\n\nSet \\(\\frac{dR}{d\\theta} = 0\\):\n\n\\[5 \\cos \\theta + 50 \\cos 2\\theta = 0\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\n\\[\\cos \\theta + 10 \\cos 2\\theta = 0\\]\n\nRecall that \\(\\cos 2\\theta = 2 \\cos^2 \\theta - 1\\):\n\n\\[\\cos \\theta + 10 (2 \\cos^2 \\theta - 1) = 0\\]\n\nExpand:\n\n\\[\\cos \\theta + 20 \\cos^2 \\theta - 10 = 0\\]\n\nRearrange:\n\n\\[20 \\cos^2 \\theta + \\cos \\theta - 10 = 0\\]\n\nLet \\(x = \\cos \\theta\\):\n\n\\[20x^2 + x - 10 = 0\\]\n\nSolve for \\(x\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 800}}{40} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{801}}{40}\\]\n\nCalculate \\(\\sqrt{801} \\approx 28.3019\\):\n\nSo,\n\n\\[x = \\frac{-1 + 28.3019}{40} \\approx \\frac{27.3019}{40} \\approx 0.6825\\]\n\nAnd\n\n\\[x = \\frac{-1 - 28.3019}{40} \\approx \\frac{-29.3019}{40} \\approx -0.7325\\]\n\nSince \\(\\cos \\theta\\) must be between -1 and 1, both are acceptable, but in this context, the angle is likely between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, so \\(\\cos \\theta \\approx 0.6825\\).\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\\theta = \\cos^{-1}(0.6825)\\]\n\nCalculate that:\n\n\\[\\theta \\approx \\cos^{-1}(0.6825) \\approx 46.8\u00b0\\]\n\nBut looking back at the options, 46.8\u00b0 is closest to 45\u00b0, but it's not exactly 45\u00b0. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should consider that the cannon is moving horizontally, and the launch velocity is relative to the cannon, not the ground.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the velocity of the ball relative to the ground.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the velocity of the ball relative to the ground.\n\nThe truck is moving at 5 m/s horizontally.\n\nThe cannon is firing at 50 m/s at an angle \u03b8 from the horizontal.\n\nSo, the ball's velocity relative to the ground is:\n\n\\[ \\vec{v}_{\\text{ball}} = \\vec{v}_{\\text{truck}} + \\vec{v}_{\\text{muzzle}} \\]\n\nExpressed in components:\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{x}} = 5 + 50 \\cos \\theta \\]\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{y}} = 50 \\sin \\theta \\]\n\nNow, the time of flight \\(t\\) is determined by the vertical motion:\n\n\\[ y = v_{\\text{y}} t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\]\n\nSince the ground is level, \\( y = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ 0 = (50 \\sin \\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.81 \\times t^2 \\]\n\nFactor out \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ t \\left(50 \\sin \\theta - \\frac{9.81}{2} t \\right) = 0 \\]\n\nSo, \\( t = 0 \\) or \\( t = \\frac{100 \\sin \\theta}{9.81} \\)\n\nThe range \\( R \\) is the horizontal distance traveled in time \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ R = v_{\\text{x}} \\times t = (5 + 50 \\cos \\theta) \\times \\frac{100 \\sin \\theta}{9.81} \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{100}{9.81} \\times (5 \\sin \\theta + 50 \\cos \\theta \\sin \\theta) \\]\n\nExpress \\( \\cos \\theta \\sin \\theta \\) as \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\sin 2\\theta \\):\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{100}{9.81} \\times (5 \\sin \\theta + 25 \\sin 2\\theta) \\]\n\nNow, to maximize \\( R \\), take the derivative with respect to \\( \\theta \\) and set it to zero.\n\n\\[ \\frac{dR}{d\\theta} = \\frac{100}{9.81} \\times (5 \\cos \\theta + 50 \\cos 2\\theta) = 0 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ 5 \\cos \\theta + 50 \\cos 2\\theta = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ \\cos \\theta + 10 \\cos 2\\theta = 0 \\]\n\nExpress \\( \\cos 2\\theta \\) in terms of \\( \\cos \\theta \\):\n\n\\[ \\cos 2\\theta = 2 \\cos^2 \\theta - 1 \\]\n\nSubstitute:\n\n\\[ \\cos \\theta + 10 (2 \\cos^2 \\theta - 1) = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ \\cos \\theta + 20 \\cos^2 \\theta - 10 = 0 \\]\n\nLet \\( x = \\cos \\theta \\):\n\n\\[ 20x^2 + x - 10 = 0 \\]\n\nSolve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 800}}{40} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{801}}{40} \\]\n\n\\[ x \\approx \\frac{-1 \\pm 28.3019}{40} \\]\n\n\\[ x \\approx 0.6825 \\text{ or } x \\approx -0.7325 \\]\n\nSince \\( \\cos \\theta \\) must be positive for the angle between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, \\( x \\approx 0.6825 \\).\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ \\theta = \\cos^{-1}(0.6825) \\approx 46.8\u00b0 \\]\n\nThis is closest to option C. 45\u00b0, but it's not exactly 45\u00b0. Maybe I need to check my calculations again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this problem.\n\nLet me consider the range formula for a projectile launched from a moving platform.\n\nThe range \\( R \\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{v_{\\text{horizontal}}^2 + v_{\\text{truck}} v_{\\text{muzzle}} \\cos \\theta}{g} \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should stick with the previous approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the effective launch velocity relative to the ground.\n\nThe horizontal component is \\( v_{\\text{x}} = 5 + 50 \\cos \\theta \\), and the vertical component is \\( v_{\\text{y}} = 50 \\sin \\theta \\).\n\nThe magnitude of the velocity is:\n\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{v_{\\text{x}}^2 + v_{\\text{y}}^2} = \\sqrt{(5 + 50 \\cos \\theta)^2 + (50 \\sin \\theta)^2} \\]\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the range is maximized when the horizontal component of velocity is maximized.\n\nWait, no. The range depends on both the horizontal velocity and the time of flight.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that for maximum range, the angle should account for the initial horizontal velocity of the truck.\n\nLet me think about it differently.\n\nSuppose the cannon is stationary; the optimal angle for maximum range is 45\u00b0. But since the cannon is moving forward, maybe the optimal angle is adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the cannon's velocity relative to the ground.\n\nLet me consider the velocity components again.\n\nThe horizontal component is \\( v_{\\text{x}} = 5 + 50 \\cos \\theta \\), and the vertical component is \\( v_{\\text{y}} = 50 \\sin \\theta \\).\n\nThe time of flight is \\( t = \\frac{2 v_{\\text{y}}}{g} = \\frac{100 \\sin \\theta}{9.81} \\).\n\nThe range is \\( R = v_{\\text{x}} \\times t = (5 + 50 \\cos \\theta) \\times \\frac{100 \\sin \\theta}{9.81} \\).\n\nTo maximize \\( R \\), I can maximize \\( v_{\\text{x}} \\times t \\), which is \\( (5 + 50 \\cos \\theta) \\times \\frac{100 \\sin \\theta}{9.81} \\).\n\nLet me define a function \\( f(\\theta) = (5 + 50 \\cos \\theta) \\sin \\theta \\), since \\( R \\) is proportional to \\( f(\\theta) \\).\n\nSo, \\( f(\\theta) = 5 \\sin \\theta + 50 \\cos \\theta \\sin \\theta = 5 \\sin \\theta + 25 \\sin 2\\theta \\).\n\nTo find the maximum of \\( f(\\theta) \\), take the derivative with respect to \\( \\theta \\) and set it to zero.\n\n\\[ f'(\\theta) = 5 \\cos \\theta + 25 \\times 2 \\cos 2\\theta = 5 \\cos \\theta + 50 \\cos 2\\theta = 0 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ 5 \\cos \\theta + 50 \\cos 2\\theta = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ \\cos \\theta + 10 \\cos 2\\theta = 0 \\]\n\nExpress \\( \\cos 2\\theta \\) in terms of \\( \\cos \\theta \\):\n\n\\[ \\cos 2\\theta = 2 \\cos^2 \\theta - 1 \\]\n\nSubstitute:\n\n\\[ \\cos \\theta + 10 (2 \\cos^2 \\theta - 1) = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ \\cos \\theta + 20 \\cos^2 \\theta - 10 = 0 \\]\n\nLet \\( x = \\cos \\theta \\):\n\n\\[ 20x^2 + x - 10 = 0 \\]\n\nSolve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 800}}{40} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{801}}{40} \\]\n\n\\[ x \\approx \\frac{-1 \\pm 28.3019}{40} \\]\n\n\\[ x \\approx 0.6825 \\text{ or } x \\approx -0.7325 \\]\n\nSince \\( \\cos \\theta \\) must be positive for the angle between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, \\( x \\approx 0.6825 \\).\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ \\theta = \\cos^{-1}(0.6825) \\approx 46.8\u00b0 \\]\n\nThis is closest to option C. 45\u00b0, but it's not exactly 45\u00b0.
