I'm not a history expert, but I do remember learning about the American Civil War and the Confederacy.\n\nLet me think first. The Confederate States of America was formed by several southern states that seceded from the United States before the Civil War. I think there were originally seven states that seceded before the war started, and then a few more joined after the war began. But I'm not sure about the exact number.\n\nOption A is 11, which seems plausible. I recall that there were around 11 states that were part of the Confederacy. But I should double-check that.\n\nOption B is 13. That's an odd number because I don't remember there being 13 Confederate states. Maybe someone is thinking of the original thirteen colonies, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption C is 16. That seems too high. I don't think the Confederacy had that many states.\n\nOption D is 22. That's definitely too many; that can't be right.\n\nLet me try to recall the names of the Confederate states. Starting with South Carolina, they were the first to secede. Then there was Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Wait, is Texas part of the Confederacy? Yes, I think it joined later.\n\nLet me count those: South Carolina, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas. That's seven states.\n\nThen, after the war started, I think Virginia seceded, and maybe a couple of other states. Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas, I believe, joined the Confederacy after the war had begun.\n\nSo adding Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas to the original seven would make 11 states in total.\n\nWait a minute, that matches option A. But let me make sure I'm not missing any.\n\nI know that Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, and Missouri were border states that didn't secede, even though they allowed slavery. So they weren't part of the Confederacy.\n\nWhat about West Virginia? I think West Virginia broke away from Virginia during the war and remained loyal to the Union, so it wasn't part of the Confederacy.\n\nAre there any other states that might have seceded that I'm not remembering? I don't think so.\n\nLet me check again: the original seven states that seceded before the war were South Carolina, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Then, after the war started, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas joined. That's a total of 11 states.\n\nI think the correct answer is A. 11.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly verify if any of the other options could possibly be correct.\n\nOption B is 13, which might be a mistake, confusing it with the original thirteen colonies.\n\nOption C is 16, which doesn't ring a bell for the number of Confederate states.\n\nOption D is 22, which is clearly too high.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is A. 11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 11} \\]"
