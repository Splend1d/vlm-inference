I need to figure out which one of these isn't a type of shoe. Maybe I should start by eliminating the ones that I know are shoes.\n\nFirst off, I've heard of brogans. I think they're a type of shoe, right? Let me recall... Brogans are those classic leather shoes with perforations and decorative patterns, often in dark colors like black or brown. They look really formal and are usually worn with suits or dressy outfits. So, definitely a style of shoe.\n\nNext, espadrilles. I've seen people wearing those, especially in the summer. They're like canvas shoes with a rope sole, right? Originated in Spain and France, I believe. They're pretty casual and comfortable, often used for everyday wear or beach outings. So, that's another definite shoe style.\n\nThen there's docksiders. I think they're also known as boat shoes. They're popular among preppy fashion and are designed for slippery surfaces, like on boats. They have a low profile and are usually made of leather or fabric with a rubber sole. So, yeah, another shoe style.\n\nNow, the last option is gingham. Hmm, I'm not so sure about this one. Gingham is a fabric pattern, isn't it? It's those checkered designs, usually in white and another color, like red or blue. I've seen gingham shirts and dresses, but is gingham a style of shoe?\n\nLet me think carefully. I can't recall ever seeing gingham referred to as a style of shoe. While it's possible that gingham could be a pattern applied to a shoe, like maybe a pair of gingham sneakers or something, it's not a distinct shoe style in its own right. Whereas the other options\u2014brogan, espadrille, and docksider\u2014are all recognized styles of shoes.\n\nSo, based on that, I would say that gingham is not a style of shoe. It seems more like a pattern or fabric type rather than a specific shoe design.\n\nWait a minute, just to make sure, maybe I should check if there's any possibility that gingham could be considered a shoe style. Let's consider that gingham is a type of cloth that could be used in the manufacture of shoes, similar to canvas in espadrilles. But even then, espadrilles are a specific design of shoe that incorporates canvas, whereas gingham isn't defining a particular style of shoe; it's just a pattern that could be used on various shoe styles.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. So, in conclusion, among the given options, gingham is not a style of shoe, whereas brogan, espadrille, and docksider are all distinct shoe styles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A. gingham}} \\]"
