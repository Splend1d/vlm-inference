                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to figure out what metal device the police use to immobilize the wheels of cars that keep getting parking tickets. The options are the Brooklyn clamp, the Denver boot, LoJack, and The Club. Hmm, let me think about each one.\n\nFirst, the Brooklyn clamp. I'm not too familiar with this one. Maybe it's some kind of clamp that attaches to the wheel? But I'm not sure if it's specifically used for immobilizing vehicles for parking violations.\n\nThen there's the Denver boot. I've heard of this before. I think it's that thing they put on your car wheel when you haven't paid your parking tickets or something. It looks like a big boot covering the tire, preventing the car from moving. So, that sounds plausible.\n\nLoJack is another option. I believe LoJack is a tracking device that helps recover stolen vehicles. It's not really something that immobility the wheels; it's more about locating the car if it's stolen. So, probably not the right choice here.\n\nLastly, The Club. I've seen these before. They're those big, ugly clamps that you can put on your steering wheel to prevent theft. But again, I don't think the police use them to immobilize wheels for parking violations. That seems more like a\u9632\u76d7 device for individual car owners.\n\nSo, between the Brooklyn clamp and the Denver boot, the Denver boot rings a bell. I think it's widely used in many cities for immobilizing vehicles of repeat parking offenders. The Brooklyn clamp might be something else, maybe related to towing or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me double-check. I recall that the Denver boot is a specific type of wheel clamp that's been used for decades to prevent cars from being moved until the owner pays the fines. It's named after Denver, Colorado, where it was first used, I think. It's a metal device that fits over the tire and locks in place, making it impossible to drive the car without removing it.\n\nThe Brooklyn clamp, on the other hand, sounds less familiar. Maybe it's another type of clamp, but I don't think it's as commonly used for this purpose.\n\nSo, based on my knowledge, the Denver boot is the correct answer. It's the one the police use to immobilize wheels of repeat parking offenders.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. Denver boot}} \\]"
