Basically, in rule consequentialism, the morality of an action isn't judged based on its immediate consequences, but rather on the consequences of following a rule that prescribes that kind of action.\n\nSo, for example, if there's a rule that says \"always tell the truth,\" then telling the truth would be right not because telling the truth in that specific instance has the best consequences, but because following the rule of always telling the truth leads to the best overall consequences.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. That action's relationship to the operative rules of law.\n\nThis seems to suggest that the rightness or wrongness depends on how the action relates to the laws that are in place. But in rule consequentialism, it's not about the law per se, but about moral rules. Laws might be one way to enforce moral rules, but they're not the same thing.\n\nB. The logical consistency behind the motive of actions of the same type.\n\nThis one is talking about the consistency of the motive. In rule consequentialism, it's more about the consequences of following a rule, not necessarily the consistency of the motive. You could have a consistent motive, but if following that motive leads to bad consequences, then according to rule consequentialism, it's not right.\n\nC. Whether a virtuous person would endorse a rule requiring, permitting, or prohibiting that action.\n\nThis seems more related to virtue ethics, where the character of a virtuous person is important. Rule consequentialism, on the other hand, is more concerned with the consequences of following a rule, not with what a virtuous person would endorse.\n\nD. Whether that action is required, permitted, or prohibited by a rule the consequences of which are best.\n\nThis seems to align more closely with rule consequentialism. It says that an action is right or wrong based on whether it's required, permitted, or prohibited by a rule, and that rule is the one whose consequences are the best.\n\nSo, in summary, according to rule consequentialism, the rightness or wrongness of an action depends on whether that action is required, permitted, or prohibited by a rule, and that rule is the one whose consequences are the best.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
