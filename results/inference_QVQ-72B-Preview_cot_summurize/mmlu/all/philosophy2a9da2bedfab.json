And the options are A. social meaning, B. faithful representation, C. its power to evoke strong emotions, D. coherence. Hmm, I need to think about what makes art, art, and which of these characteristics is most fundamental.\n\nFirst off, let's consider what a formal characteristic might be. In art, formal elements refer to the visual components and the way they're organized, like composition, color, form, and texture. So, perhaps the question is asking about a key aspect of how art is put together or presented.\n\nOption A is social meaning. While many artworks carry social messages and can comment on society, is social meaning a formal characteristic? Maybe not directly. Social meaning seems more about the content or the message rather than the form itself. So, perhaps this isn't the primary formal characteristic.\n\nOption B is faithful representation. This makes me think of realism in art, where the artist tries to depict things as they appear in reality. However, not all art aims for realism. Abstract art, for example, doesn't try to represent reality accurately. It's more about expressing ideas or emotions through forms and colors. So, if faithful representation isn't a requirement for all art, maybe it's not the most important formal characteristic.\n\nOption C is its power to evoke strong emotions. This seems significant. Art has often been used to stir emotions in viewers, whether it's joy, sadness, anger, or inspiration. Emotional impact can be a powerful aspect of art, but is it a formal characteristic? While emotion is a crucial element, it's more about the effect of the art rather than its formal properties. Maybe it's not the best fit for the question.\n\nOption D is coherence. Coherence refers to things making sense or being logically consistent. In art, this could relate to how well the different elements work together to create a unified whole. A coherent artwork has a sense of order and harmony, where all parts contribute to a single, clear message or aesthetic.\n\nThinking back to the other options, social meaning isn't necessarily a formal characteristic, faithful representation isn't universal across all art styles, and emotional evocation is more about the impact rather than the form. Coherence, on the other hand, seems to cut across different styles and periods in art history. Whether it's representational or abstract art, a coherent piece is one where the formal elements are well-integrated and purposeful.\n\nMoreover, coherence can be seen in the use of artistic principles like balance, proportion, unity, and variety. These help ensure that the artwork hangs together in a way that is visually pleasing or at least intentionally designed.\n\nSo, based on this reflection, I think coherence is an important formal characteristic of art. It's something that artists across different movements and mediums strive for, even if the methods and goals vary.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D}} \\]"
