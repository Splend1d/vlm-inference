                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"When n = 11, what is the value of 10 \u2013 (n + 6)?\"\n\nOkay, let's break this down. It says n is 11, and I need to find the value of this expression: 10 minus n plus 6.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the expression inside the parentheses means. It's n plus 6, and n is 11, so n plus 6 would be 11 plus 6, which is 17.\n\nSo, the expression becomes 10 minus 17.\n\nNow, 10 minus 17. Hmm, that's like subtracting a bigger number from a smaller number, which usually gives a negative result. So, 10 minus 17 should be -7.\n\nLet me double-check that. If I have 10 and I take away 17, I can think of it as owing someone 7, since 10 minus 17 is the same as saying I'm short by 7. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the value of the expression when n is 11 is -7.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. \u20137\n\nB. 5\n\nC. 7\n\nD. 27\n\nIt seems like option A is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I should try plugging in the value step by step.\n\nStart with the original expression: 10 \u2013 (n + 6)\n\nSubstitute n with 11: 10 \u2013 (11 + 6)\n\nFirst, do the operation inside the parentheses: 11 + 6 equals 17\n\nThen, subtract that from 10: 10 \u2013 17 equals -7\n\nYes, that matches my initial calculation.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using some different approach to confirm.\n\nAnother way could be to evaluate the entire expression without substituting n first, but I think I already did that.\n\nLet me see: 10 \u2013 (n + 6)\n\nIf I distribute the negative sign inside, it becomes 10 - n - 6\n\nNow, combine like terms: 10 - 6 is 4, and then -n is just -11.\n\nSo, 4 - 11 equals -7 again.\n\nAlright, that confirms my earlier result.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), I should do what's inside the parentheses first, which is n + 6, then subtract that from 10.\n\nSo, again, 11 + 6 is 17, and 10 - 17 is -7.\n\nI think I've covered a few different ways to approach this, and each time I end up with -7.\n\nLet me check if there's any possible trick here. The question says \"when n = 11, what is the value of 10 \u2013 (n + 6)?\"\n\nSeems straightforward. No tricks like considering only positive values or anything like that.\n\nAlso, the options are clear: A is -7, B is 5, C is 7, and D is 27.\n\nSince my calculation consistently gives -7, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to be extra sure, maybe I can visualize this on a number line.\n\nStart at 10, then subtract 17. Moving left on the number line from 10 by 17 units would take me to -7.\n\nPerfect.\n\nI think that's all I need to confirm that the answer is -7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-7} \\]"
