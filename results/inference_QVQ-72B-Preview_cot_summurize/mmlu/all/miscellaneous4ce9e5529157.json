                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of these painting tools has bristles on it? A. Easel, B. Knife, C. Brush, D. Palette.\" Hmm, let's see. I'm not the most artistic person, but I think I know a bit about painting tools.\n\nFirst off, an easel is like a stand that holds the canvas while you're painting, right? It's usually made of wood or metal and has adjustable parts to keep the canvas at the right angle. But does it have bristles? No, I don't think so. It's more of a support structure. So, probably not A.\n\nNext, a knife. I believe artists use palette knives for mixing paints or applying thick layers of paint. They're kind of like spatulas made of metal. They're useful for textural effects. But again, do they have bristles? No, they're smooth metal blades. So, probably not B.\n\nNow, a brush. This seems familiar. Paintbrushes are what most people think of when they think of painting tools. They have handles and then bristles or hairs that hold the paint and apply it to the canvas. So, they definitely have bristles. This seems like a likely answer.\n\nLastly, a palette. This is the flat surface that artists use to mix their paints. It can be made of wood, plastic, or even glass. It's where they blend colors before applying them to the canvas. Does it have bristles? No, it's a smooth surface for mixing. So, probably not D.\n\nLet me just double-check. Easel \u2013 no bristles. Knife \u2013 no bristles. Brush \u2013 yes, bristles. Palette \u2013 no bristles. So, the correct answer should be C. Brush.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that a knife could have bristles? No, I don't think so. Knives are typically smooth for spreading paint. And an easel is definitely just a stand without bristles. The palette is also smooth for mixing, so no bristles there.\n\nI think I'm confident with my choice. The answer is C. Brush.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
