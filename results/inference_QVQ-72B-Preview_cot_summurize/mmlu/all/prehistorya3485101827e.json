                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the history of dairying in Europe, specifically about when cheese and yogurt production became really important for people's diets, and what gave them an edge in being able to digest these dairy products. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst off, the question mentions archaeological evidence for cheese and yogurt production in Europe. Archaeology deals with physical remains from the past, so I guess there must be some artifacts or residues that suggest people were making these products. But I'm not too familiar with the specifics, so I'll need to think about this carefully.\n\nThe options are given with different timeframes: 10,000 years ago, 7,500 years ago, 5,500 years ago, and 3,500 years ago. Each option pairs a time with a particular development that supposedly provided an adaptive advantage related to dairying.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that 10,000 years ago, artificial selection for certain varieties of cheese provided an adaptive advantage. Now, 10,000 years ago is around the time when agriculture was starting to develop in some parts of the world, like the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East. However, Europe at that time was still largely reliant on hunting and gathering. I think agriculture, including animal domestication, spread into Europe from the Near East, but it didn't reach all of Europe until later. So, I'm a bit skeptical that cheese production was already happening in Europe 10,000 years ago. Maybe in other regions, but probably not in Europe yet at that time.\n\nOption B suggests that 7,500 years ago, the lactase persistence mutation provided an adaptive advantage. Lactase persistence is the ability to digest lactose, the sugar found in milk, into adulthood. Most mammals, including humans, lose this ability after weaning, but in some human populations, especially in parts of Europe, there's a genetic mutation that allows adults to continue producing lactase. This is thought to be due to the cultural practice of drinking milk from domesticated animals. So, if this mutation started to spread around 7,500 years ago, it would make sense that dairying was already established by then and that being able to digest milk was beneficial.\n\nOption C mentions 5,500 years ago and domesticated cattle providing an adaptive advantage. Cattle were first domesticated much earlier, around 10,000 years ago in the Near East, and spread into Europe over time. By 5,500 years ago, cattle were certainly present in many parts of Europe, and they were being raised for meat and possibly milk. So, having domesticated cattle would indeed support dairying, but I need to see if this matches up with the evidence for cheese and yogurt production.\n\nOption D refers to 3,500 years ago and certain strains of lactose-free cheese and yogurt providing an advantage. Lactose-free dairy products are those where the lactose has been broken down, making them easier to digest for people who are lactose intolerant. Cheeses like yogurt can be lower in lactose, especially if they've been aged or fermented. However, the lactase persistence mutation, which allows adults to digest lactose, was likely already present by this time, so maybe lactose-free cheeses weren't as crucial an adaptation.\n\nNow, I need to think about when cheese and yogurt production actually started in Europe based on archaeological evidence.\n\nI recall that cheese-making equipment has been found in various archaeological sites in Europe, dating back to around 5,000 to 7,000 years ago. For example, residues on ancient pottery fragments suggest that people were making cheese in Central Europe around 7,500 years ago.\n\nSimilarly, yogurt is thought to have originated in Central Asia or the Middle East, possibly spreading to Europe later, but I'm not sure about the exact timing.\n\nGiven that, option B seems plausible because it aligns with the timing of the lactase persistence mutation's appearance in Europe, which is thought to have occurred around 7,500 years ago in response to the consumption of milk.\n\nBut wait, if cheese and yogurt production started earlier, say around 7,500 years ago, and the lactase persistence mutation arose around the same time, maybe both are part of the same developmental process.\n\nHowever, I think that cheese and yogurt production likely predated the widespread adoption of milk drinking, as these products would have been ways to preserve and consume milk without the immediate lactose load.\n\nSo, perhaps cheese and yogurt production began around 7,500 years ago, and the lactase persistence mutation started to spread because people were consuming these dairy products more regularly.\n\nThat would make option B the correct answer: 7,500 years ago, the lactase persistence mutation provided an adaptive advantage.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nI found that the earliest evidence for cheese-making in Europe comes from around 5,000 to 7,000 years ago, with some suggestions that it might even be older.\n\nFor example, there's evidence from Poland of cheese-making equipment dating back to around 7,500 years ago.\n\nSimilarly, the lactase persistence mutation is thought to have arisen independently in several European populations around 7,500 years ago, coinciding with the beginning of widespread dairying.\n\nTherefore, it seems that by 7,500 years ago, dairying was becoming an important part of subsistence in Europe, and the mutation that allowed adults to digest milk provided an adaptive advantage.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 7,500; the lactase persistence mutation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other options could also be correct.\n\nOption A: 10,000 years ago is too early for widespread dairying in Europe, as agriculture hadn't yet fully taken hold.\n\nOption C: 5,500 years ago is after the appearance of the lactase persistence mutation, and while domesticated cattle were present, the mutation was likely already spreading by then.\n\nOption D: 3,500 years ago is much later, and while lactose-free dairy products might have been developed by then, the lactase persistence mutation was already present in many European populations by that time.\n\nTherefore, the most logical answer is B. 7,500; the lactase persistence mutation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
