                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a contractor and a homeowner negotiating the price for building a new home. The contractor offered $100,000, and now we have to figure out which of these options wouldn't terminate that offer, meaning that the homeowner could still accept it later on. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for an offer to be terminated. In contract law, once an offer is made, certain actions can end it before it's accepted. These typically include rejection, counteroffer, revocation by the offeror, lapse of time, or performance that makes the offer impossible to fulfill. So, I should look at each option and see if it does any of these things.\n\nOption A says that the homeowner asks the contractor if they would be willing to build the house for $95,000. Hmm, this sounds like a counteroffer. In contract law, making a counteroffer is generally considered a rejection of the original offer and the creation of a new offer. So, if the homeowner is proposing a lower price, that's a counteroffer, which terminates the original $100,000 offer. Therefore, a subsequent acceptance of the original offer wouldn't be effective because it's already been terminated by the counteroffer.\n\nOption B says that the contractor contacts the homeowner and states that the offer is withdrawn. This is a clear revocation of the offer by the offeror. Once the offeror revokes the offer, it's terminated, and any later acceptance by the offeree is\u65e0\u6548 because the offer no longer exists. So, this would also terminate the offer.\n\nOption C mentions that the contractor dies before the homeowner accepts, but the contractor's son intends to continue the business. This is interesting. In general, the death of the offeror terminates the offer because offers are typically personal and tied to the offeror's capacity. However, if the contractor's son intends to continue the business and honor the offer, there might be some exceptions or specific rules that apply here. But generally, the death of the offeror terminates the offer.\n\nOption D says that the homeowner states, \"I accept your offer but the price is to be $97,000.\" This seems similar to option A; it's a conditional acceptance or effectively a counteroffer. By specifying a different price, the homeowner is modifying the terms of the original offer, which typically constitutes a rejection of the original offer and a new offer. Therefore, this would also terminate the original offer.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, all of these options seem to terminate the offer in some way: A and D through counteroffers, B through revocation, and C through the offeror's death. But the question is asking which of these communications would not terminate the offer, meaning that a subsequent acceptance could still be effective.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps there's an option here that doesn't terminate the offer. Let me consider each one again.\n\nIn option A, the homeowner asks if the contractor would build for $95,000. Is this a definite counteroffer, or could it be seen as a request for a better price without necessarily rejecting the original offer? If it's just a request for a better price without a formal counteroffer, maybe the original offer is still open. But generally, in contract law, making a specific alternative proposal is considered a counteroffer, which terminates the original offer.\n\nOption B is straightforward: the contractor revokes the offer, ending it.\n\nOption C involves the death of the contractor. Normally, the death of a party terminates offers because contracts are based on the agreement of living entities. However, if the business is continued by the contractor's son, perhaps there's an argument that the offer remains valid. But I think the general rule is that death terminates the offer.\n\nOption D is another counteroffer, which, like option A, terminates the original offer.\n\nSo, if all these options terminate the offer, does that mean none of them allow a subsequent acceptance to be effective? Or is there a scenario where one of these doesn't terminate the offer?\n\nLet me consider if there's any way that any of these options wouldn't terminate the offer.\n\nFor option A, if the homeowner's request for a lower price is not phrased as a formal counteroffer but more as a negotiation tactic, maybe the original offer is still open. But that seems like a stretch.\n\nOption B is clear: the contractor has revoked the offer.\n\nOption C, with the contractor's death, is also clear: the offer is terminated.\n\nOption D is another clear counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, it seems that all of these options terminate the offer, meaning that none of them would allow a subsequent acceptance to be effective. But the question is phrased to suggest that one of them does not terminate the offer.\n\nPerhaps I'm missing something. Maybe there's a scenario where the death of the offeror doesn't terminate the offer, especially if the business is continued by someone else.\n\nLet me look up the law on this. In general, the death of the offeror terminates the offer because offers are personal. However, if the offeror has assigned the right to make the offer to someone else, or if the business is continued, there might be exceptions.\n\nBut in standard contract law, the death of the offeror terminates the offer. So, unless there's something specific about the continuation of the business that keeps the offer alive, option C would still terminate the offer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the son's intention to continue the business implies that the offer remains valid, and a subsequent acceptance could still be effective.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the key is that the son intends to continue the business, so the offer isn't terminated by the contractor's death.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose the contractor dies, but the son steps in and says, \"I'll honor my father's offer.\" In that case, perhaps the offer is still valid, and the homeowner could accept it.\n\nHowever, in standard contract law, the death of the offeror terminates the offer unless there's an agreement to the contrary.\n\nGiven that, I'm still inclined to think that all these options terminate the offer.\n\nBut the question is designed to have one correct answer, so perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the question is trying to test the concept of firm offers under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). Under the UCC, merchants can make firm offers that are irrevocable for a certain period, even if they die or go bankrupt.\n\nBut in this scenario, it's about constructing a home, which might not necessarily fall under the UCC, as it deals more with sales of goods rather than services or construction work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the son's intention to continue the business means that the offer is still valid, and thus a subsequent acceptance could be effective.\n\nLet me consider that possibility. If the contractor dies, but the business is continued by the son, who intends to honor the offer, then perhaps the offer isn't terminated.\n\nIn that case, option C wouldn't terminate the offer, and a subsequent acceptance could be effective.\n\nHowever, this seems like a grey area in contract law. Generally, the death of the offeror terminates the offer, but if the business is continued and the offer is honored by the successor, maybe the offer remains valid.\n\nPerhaps the answer is C, as the son's intention to continue the business keeps the offer alive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe none of the options allow a subsequent acceptance to be effective, but that doesn't seem to align with the question's structure.\n\nI need to make a decision based on the information given.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with option C as the one that wouldn't terminate the offer, assuming that the son's intention to continue the business means that the offer remains valid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
