                    "text": "Let's see. I'm on this shrinking planet, and it shrinks to one-tenth its original diameter, but my mass stays the same. I need to figure out how my weight changes. Weight is basically the force of gravity pulling me toward the planet, right? So, weight is given by the formula:\n\n\\[w = \\frac{g m m_p}{r^2}\\]\n\nWait, no. Actually, the gravitational force between two masses is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation:\n\n\\[f = \\frac{g m m_p}{r^2}\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(f\\) is the gravitational force\n\n- \\(g\\) is the gravitational constant\n\n- \\(m\\) is my mass\n\n- \\(m_p\\) is the mass of the planet\n\n- \\(r\\) is the distance between the centers of the two masses\n\nBut since I'm on the surface of the planet, \\(r\\) is the radius of the planet, right?\n\nSo, \\(f = \\frac{g m m_p}{r^2}\\)\n\nBut weight is often thought of as the force due to gravity, so \\(w = m \\times g\\), where \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet's surface.\n\nAnd \\(g\\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[g = \\frac{g m_p}{r^2}\\]\n\nSo, weight \\(w = m \\times \\frac{g m_p}{r^2}\\)\n\nNow, the problem says the planet shrinks to one-tenth its original diameter. Diameter is twice the radius, so if the diameter shrinks to one-tenth, that means the radius shrinks to one-tenth of its original value as well.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\(r\\) as the original radius\n\n- \\(r'\\) as the new radius\n\nSo, \\(r' = \\frac{r}{10}\\)\n\nSince mass remains constant on the shrunken surface, \\(m_p\\) stays the same.\n\nNow, originally, weight \\(w = m \\times \\frac{g m_p}{r^2}\\)\n\nAfter shrinking, new weight \\(w' = m \\times \\frac{g m_p}{(r')^2} = m \\times \\frac{g m_p}{(\\frac{r}{10})^2} = m \\times \\frac{g m_p}{\\frac{r^2}{100}} = m \\times g m_p \\times \\frac{100}{r^2}\\)\n\nSo, \\(w' = 100 \\times (m \\times \\frac{g m_p}{r^2}) = 100 \\times w\\)\n\nWait, that would mean my weight increases by a factor of 100.\n\nBut let's double-check this reasoning.\n\nThe formula for weight on the surface of a planet is indeed \\(w = m g\\), where \\(g = \\frac{g m_p}{r^2}\\).\n\nIf the radius decreases to one-tenth, then \\(r'\\) is \\(\\frac{r}{10}\\), so:\n\n\\(g' = \\frac{g m_p}{(r/10)^2} = \\frac{g m_p}{r^2/100} = g m_p \\times \\frac{100}{r^2}\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(g' = 100 \\times g\\)\n\nSo, \\(w' = m \\times g' = m \\times 100 g = 100 \\times (m g) = 100 \\times w\\)\n\nHmm, so weight increases by a factor of 100.\n\nBut wait, is there something I'm missing here?\n\nLet me think about the mass distribution. The problem says \"no change in mass on the shrunken surface,\" which I interpreted as the mass of the planet \\(m_p\\) remains constant. Is that correct?\n\nIf the planet shrinks but its mass stays the same, assuming it's a uniform density, then yes, \\(m_p\\) remains constant.\n\nBut if the planet shrinks and its mass is proportional to its volume, then if volume decreases, mass should decrease as well, unless density increases.\n\nBut the problem says \"no change in mass on the shrunken surface,\" which might imply that the mass of the planet remains the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mass is distributed differently.\n\nBut to keep it simple, assuming \\(m_p\\) remains constant, then yes, weight increases by a factor of 100.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 100 times as much.\n\nBut let's see why the other options are wrong.\n\nOption A says 1/100 as much. That would be the case if the radius increased to 10 times, not decreased.\n\nOption B says 10 times as much. That would be if the radius decreased to one-tenth, but that only accounts for the linear decrease, not the square.\n\nOption D says 1000 times as much. That might be a confusion with cubic relationships, like volume, but weight depends on the inverse square of the radius.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the correct answer is C. 100 times as much.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
