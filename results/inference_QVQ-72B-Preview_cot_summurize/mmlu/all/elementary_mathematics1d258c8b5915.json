                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to estimate 4,286 times 390. Hmm, that seems like a big multiplication, but I think I can handle it by rounding the numbers to make it easier.\n\nFirst, I'll round 4,286 to the nearest thousand. It's closer to 4,000 than to 5,000, so I'll go with 4,000. For 390, it's closer to 400 than to 300 or 500, so I'll round it to 400.\n\nNow, I need to multiply 4,000 by 400. I remember that multiplying by thousands and hundreds is like multiplying the coefficients and then adding the zeros. So, 4 times 4 is 16, and then I have three zeros from 4,000 and two zeros from 400, which adds up to five zeros in total. So, 16 with five zeros is 1,600,000.\n\nLet me double-check that. 4,000 is 4 times 1,000, and 400 is 4 times 100. So, 4 times 4 is 16, and 1,000 times 100 is 100,000. So, 16 times 100,000 is indeed 1,600,000.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 12,000,000\n\nB. 1,600,000\n\nC. 1,200,000\n\nD. 16,000\n\nMy calculation gives me 1,600,000, which is option B. But just to be sure, maybe I should consider another way to estimate this product.\n\nAnother approach could be to break down the numbers into smaller parts and use the distributive property. For example, 4,286 is roughly 4,000 plus 286, and 390 is 400 minus 10. But that might make it more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I could round 4,286 down to 4,000 and 390 up to 400, which is what I did before, and that gave me 1,600,000. Or maybe I should round 4,286 up to 4,300 and 390 down to 390, but that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider that 4,286 is almost 4,300, and 390 is almost 400. So, 4,300 times 400 would be 1,720,000. Hmm, that's different from my previous estimate of 1,600,000.\n\nLet me see: 4,286 is 14 less than 4,300, which is a difference of about 0.32% (since 14/4,300 \u2248 0.0032). Similarly, 390 is 10 less than 400, which is a 2.5% difference (10/400 = 0.025). So, my initial rounding might have introduced some error.\n\nPerhaps I should use a different strategy. Maybe I can use scientific notation. 4,286 is 4.286 times 10^3, and 390 is 3.9 times 10^2. Multiplying these together: (4.286)(3.9)(10^3)(10^2).\n\nFirst, multiply 4.286 by 3.9. Let's approximate: 4 times 4 is 16, and then subtract 4 times 0.1 (which is 0.4), so 16 minus 0.4 is 15.6. So, 4.286 times 3.9 is roughly 15.6 (though I should check that more accurately).\n\nWait, actually, 4.286 times 4 is 17.144, and 4.286 times 0.1 is 0.4286. So, 17.144 minus 0.4286 is approximately 16.7154. So, more accurately, it's about 16.7154.\n\nThen, multiply by 10^3 times 10^2, which is 10^5, or 100,000. So, 16.7154 times 100,000 is 1,671,540.\n\nHmm, that's closer to 1,700,000 than to 1,600,000. Maybe my initial estimate of rounding to 4,000 and 400 was too low.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I can use the formula for estimating products by using compatible numbers. Compatible numbers are numbers that are easy to compute mentally.\n\nSo, 4,286 is close to 4,300, and 390 is close to 400. Let's multiply 4,300 by 390.\n\nFirst, 4,300 times 400 is 1,720,000. But since it's 390, which is 10 less than 400, I need to subtract 4,300 times 10, which is 43,000. So, 1,720,000 minus 43,000 is 1,677,000.\n\nThat's even closer to the 1,671,540 I got earlier. So, it seems that the exact answer is around 1,677,000, and my initial estimate of 1,600,000 is a bit low.\n\nLet me check the exact multiplication to confirm. 4,286 times 390.\n\nFirst, multiply 4,286 by 0, which is 0. Then, multiply 4,286 by 90, which is 4,286 times 9 times 10, so 38,574 times 10 is 385,740. Then, multiply 4,286 by 300, which is 4,286 times 3 times 100, so 12,858 times 100 is 1,285,800. Now, add 1,285,800 plus 385,740.\n\n1,285,800\n\n+  385,740\n\n= 1,671,540\n\nYes, exactly 1,671,540. So, the best estimate among the options is 1,600,000, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, 1,671,540 is closer to 1,700,000 than to 1,600,000. However, the options don't have 1,700,000, and 1,600,000 is the closest among the given choices.\n\nTherefore, the best estimate for 4,286 times 390 is 1,600,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
