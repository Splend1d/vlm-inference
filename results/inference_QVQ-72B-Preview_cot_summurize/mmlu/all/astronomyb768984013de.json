Tritos and Deimos\n\nC. Phobos and Tritos\n\nD. Phobos and Deimos\n\nAlright, I need to recall the names of Mars' moons. I remember that Mars has two small moons, and their names are Phobos and Deimos. But let me make sure I'm not mixing them up with other celestial bodies.\n\nFirst, Phobos is the larger and closer of the two moons to Mars. It's famous for its rapid orbit; it circles Mars faster than Mars rotates, which means that from the perspective of someone on Mars, Phobos would rise in the west and set in the east, the opposite of what we see with the Sun and most moons in the solar system.\n\nDeimos, on the other hand, is smaller and orbits farther from Mars. It moves more slowly across the Martian sky, rising in the east and setting in the west, similar to Earth's Moon.\n\nNow, looking back at the options, option D clearly lists Phobos and Deimos together, which matches what I recall.\n\nOption A is Tritos and Desmos. Wait a minute, I don't remember Tritos being a moon of Mars. Maybe it's a typo or a similar name? Let me think... Oh, wait, Triton is a moon of Neptune, not Mars. So that can't be right.\n\nOption B is Tritos and Deimos. Again, Deimos is correct, but Tritos seems like a mix-up. Maybe it's a common mistake, but I don't think so.\n\nOption C is Phobos and Tritos. Again, Phobos is correct, but Tritos doesn't ring a bell as a moon of Mars.\n\nSo, based on my knowledge, the correct answer should be option D: Phobos and Deimos.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll double-check some facts about these moons. Phobos is about 27 kilometers in diameter and orbits Mars at a distance of about 9,377 kilometers. Deimos is smaller, about 15 kilometers in diameter, and orbits at a distance of about 23,460 kilometers from Mars.\n\nBoth moons are irregular in shape and appear to be captured asteroids, given their composition and orbits.\n\nI don't think there's any confusion here; the names are straightforward. So, I'm confident that option D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
