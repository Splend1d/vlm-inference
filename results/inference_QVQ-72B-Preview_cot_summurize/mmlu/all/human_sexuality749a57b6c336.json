                    "text": "So I've got this question here about JD Unwin's book called \"Sex and Culture.\" It's asking what two things Unwin argues are linked in this book. The options are:\n\nA. homosexuality in sons with distant fathers\n\nB. sexual abuse and Christianity\n\nC. civilizational collapse and promiscuity\n\nD. anthropology and evolution\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what \"Sex and Culture\" is about. From the title, it seems like it discusses the relationship between sexual practices and cultural development or perhaps the impact of sexual behaviors on societies.\n\nLet me think about JD Unwin. I'm not super familiar with him off the top of my head, but I recall that he was an anthropologist or a sociologist who studied the connection between sexual norms and the rise and fall of civilizations. So, he probably looked at how different sexual behaviors or attitudes corresponded with the prosperity or decline of societies throughout history.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nA. Homosexuality in sons with distant fathers \u2013 This sounds more like a psychological or family dynamics theory, maybe something related to parental influence on sexual orientation. But I don't remember Unwin's work focusing specifically on this.\n\nB. Sexual abuse and Christianity \u2013 This seems to point towards some connection between sexual abuse and the Christian religion. While there have been well-documented cases of sexual abuse within the Catholic Church, for example, I don't think that's the main focus of Unwin's \"Sex and Culture.\" He seems to take a broader view of civilizations and their sexual mores.\n\nC. Civilizational collapse and promiscuity \u2013 This option suggests a link between the decline of civilizations and promiscuous behavior. This rings a bell. I think Unwin argued that as civilizations became more sexually permissive, they tended to experience a decline in social cohesion and eventually in their overall stability and power.\n\nD. Anthropology and evolution \u2013 This is a very broad connection between two fields of study. While Unwin was an anthropologist, and his work might touch on evolutionary concepts, I don't think this is the primary argument of \"Sex and Culture.\"\n\nGiven this, option C seems the most plausible. Unwin is known for proposing that sexual restraint and monogamy were associated with the rise and maintenance of civilized societies, whereas increased sexual permissiveness and promiscuity were correlated with their decline.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider if there's any evidence or additional information that supports this.\n\nA quick search in my mind brings up that Unwin did extensive research on various civilizations, from ancient societies to modern ones, and analyzed the relationship between their sexual norms and their cultural achievements and longevity.\n\nHis thesis, as I recall, was that cultures with strict sexual regulations, particularly those that promoted monogamy and delayed gratification, tended to be more productive and stable, leading to greater cultural and technological advancements. Conversely, when these regulations relaxed, leading to higher levels of promiscuity, societies experienced a decline in their moral fabric, which eventually led to their downfall.\n\nThis sounds a lot like option C: civilizational collapse and promiscuity.\n\nOption A, homosexuality in sons with distant fathers, seems unrelated to the main theme of Unwin's work, which is the broad-scale analysis of sexual norms and civilizational health.\n\nOption B, sexual abuse and Christianity, is a specific association between a social issue and a particular religion, which doesn't align with Unwin's comparative approach across multiple civilizations and cultures.\n\nOption D, anthropology and evolution, is too general and doesn't specify any particular argument or connection that Unwin makes in his book.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. civilizational collapse and promiscuity.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider if there's any other aspect of Unwin's work that might suggest a different answer.\n\nFor instance, perhaps his work touches on the relationship between sexual abuse and Christianity, but as far as I know, his focus was more on general sexual norms across different societies rather than specific issues within one religion.\n\nSimilarly, while Unwin might have discussed homosexuality as part of his broader study of sexual norms, his main argument was about the relationship between sexual restraint or promiscuity and civilizational health, not specifically about homosexuality.\n\nAs for anthropology and evolution, while these are related fields, Unwin's \"Sex and Culture\" seems to be more about cultural anthropology and sociological analysis rather than evolutionary theory.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. civilizational collapse and promiscuity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
