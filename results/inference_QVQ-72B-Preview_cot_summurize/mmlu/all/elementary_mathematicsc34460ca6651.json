                    "text": "So I need to find the prime factorization of 48, and use exponents where possible. Let's see, prime factorization means breaking down a number into its smallest prime number components. Exponents come in handy when a prime number repeats in the factorization.\n\nFirst, I should start by dividing 48 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. 48 divided by 2 is 24. So, 2 is a prime factor of 48. I can write that down.\n\nNow, I have 24 left. I can divide that by 2 again, and I get 12. So, another 2. Keeping track, that's two 2's so far.\n\nDividing 12 by 2 gives me 6. Another 2. So now, that's three 2's.\n\nThen, 6 divided by 2 is 3. So, one more 2, making it four 2's in total.\n\nNow, 3 is a prime number, and it divides into 3 exactly once. So, I have four 2's and one 3.\n\nUsing exponents, that would be 2 raised to the power of 4, times 3 raised to the power of 1.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 4 \u2022 8\n\nWell, 4 is 2 squared, and 8 is 2 cubed, so that would be 2^2 times 2^3, which is 2^5, which is 32, not 48. So, that's not correct.\n\nB. 6 \u2022 8\n\n6 is 2 times 3, and 8 is 2 cubed. So, that would be 2 times 3 times 2 cubed, which is 2^4 times 3, which is 16 times 3, which is 48. But let's see if this matches our prime factorization.\n\nWait, 2^4 is 16, times 3 is 48. That seems correct, but let's double-check.\n\nI had four 2's and one 3, so 2^4 \u2022 3.\n\nOption C says 2^3 \u2022 3^2, which is 8 times 9, which is 72, not 48. So, that's incorrect.\n\nOption D says 2^4 \u2022 3, which is 16 times 3, which is 48. That matches what I found.\n\nBut wait, option B also seems to suggest 6 \u2022 8, which is the same as 2 \u2022 3 \u2022 2^3, which simplifies to 2^4 \u2022 3, same as option D.\n\nHowever, in terms of prime factorization, it's better to have the primes in ascending order and with exponents.\n\nSo, 2^4 \u2022 3 is the correct prime factorization of 48 using exponents.\n\nI think the answer is D. 2^4 \u2022 3.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there are any other ways to factorize 48 into primes.\n\n48 can be divided by 2 four times, as I did, and then by 3 once. So, yes, that's 2^4 \u2022 3.\n\nAlternatively, if I divide 48 by 3 first, 48 divided by 3 is 16, then 16 is 2^4. So, again, 2^4 \u2022 3.\n\nI don't think there's another way to do it, so I'm confident that D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
