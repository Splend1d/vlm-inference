                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which one of these instruments is used to measure humidity. The options are anemometer, ammeter, hygrometer, and barometer. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about all of them, but let's go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, an anemometer. I think an anemometer is used to measure wind speed. You know, like those devices with cups that spin when the wind blows, and they measure how fast the wind is moving. So, that seems to be for wind speed, not humidity. So, probably not the right choice.\n\nNext, an ammeter. I recall that an ammeter is used to measure electric current. It's like a device that you use in electricity circuits to see how much current is flowing through a wire. So, that's about electricity, not about humidity in the air. So, I think I can eliminate that one too.\n\nNow, a hygrometer. This one sounds a bit familiar, but I'm not sure what it measures. Let me think. The prefix \"hygro-\" seems related to moisture or humidity. Maybe it's used to measure humidity in the air. That seems plausible. Maybe that's the correct answer.\n\nLastly, a barometer. I know that a barometer is used to measure atmospheric pressure. It's often used in weather forecasting to predict changes in the weather based on pressure changes. So, that's about pressure, not humidity. So, probably not the one we're looking for here.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Anemometer is for wind speed, ammeter is for electric current, hygrometer seems to be for humidity, and barometer is for atmospheric pressure. So, among these options, the hygrometer is the one that measures humidity.\n\nI think the answer is C. hygrometer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
