A buyer recently purchased an undeveloped beachfront lot in the jurisdiction. He hired a building contractor to construct a new house on the property. Thereafter, the contractor employed a subcontractor to provide on-site maintenance. The contractor contracted with a cement company to supply concrete for the foundation of the structure. After excavation started, an employee of the cement company delivered a load of concrete to the construction site. To facilitate delivery, the contractor and the subcontractor had built an access ramp extending from the street to the lot. As the employee was driving over the ramp, it suddenly collapsed and caused the truck to overturn, seriously injuring the employee. A subsequent investigation determined that the contractor and the subcontractor negligently used substandard materials in constructing the ramp. In addition, the employee was partially at fault for driving while intoxicated. The employee brought suit against the contractor and the subcontractor to recover damages for his injuries. A special trial was held on the issue of negligence, and it was adjudged that each party was contributorily negligent as follows:PARTY DEGREE OF NEGLIGENCEPlaintiff: (the EE) 40%Defendant: (the contractor) 35%Defendant: (the subcontractor) 25%The employee, who suffered damages in the amount of $100,000, brings a personal injury action against the contractor individually.

                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out how much the injured employee can recover from the contractor. Let me try to understand all the parts.\n\nFirst, there's a modified comparative negligence statute in place. From what I remember, comparative negligence means that the amount of damages a plaintiff can recover is reduced by their own percentage of fault. But this statute says that contributory negligence doesn't bar recovery entirely, as long as the plaintiff's negligence isn't greater than the defendant's. And it also mentions joint and several liability for joint tortfeasors.\n\nSo, in this case, there are multiple parties involved: the employee who was injured, the contractor, and the subcontractor. The employee was 40% at fault because he was driving while intoxicated. The contractor is 35% at fault, and the subcontractor is 25% at fault for using substandard materials in the ramp.\n\nThe employee's total damages are $100,000, and he's suing only the contractor, not the subcontractor. So, my first thought is to calculate how much the employee can recover from the contractor based on their percentage of fault.\n\nBut wait, the statute says that if the plaintiff's negligence is not as great as the defendant's, they can recover, but the damages are diminished according to their own negligence. In this case, the employee is 40% at fault, and the contractor is 35% at fault. So, the employee's negligence is greater than the contractor's, right? But the statute says that as long as the plaintiff's negligence isn't as great as the person against whom recovery is sought, they can recover. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing.\n\nLet me read that again. The statute says: \"Contributory negligence shall not bar recovery... if such negligence was not as great as the negligence of the person against whom recovery is sought.\" So, in this case, the employee is 40% at fault, and the contractor is 35% at fault. So, the employee's negligence is greater than the contractor's. Does that mean that the employee cannot recover from the contractor because his negligence is greater?\n\nWait, but the statute also says that any damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the plaintiff. So, even if the plaintiff's negligence is greater, they can still recover, but their recovery is reduced by their own percentage of fault.\n\nI think I need to look up how this specific statute works. Maybe I should check some legal resources or see if there are similar cases that interpret this statute.\n\nAlright, assuming that under this modified comparative negligence rule, the plaintiff can recover as long as their negligence isn't greater than the combined negligence of all defendants, but in this case, the employee is only suing the contractor, not the subcontractor.\n\nWait, but the statute mentions \"the person against whom recovery is sought,\" which is the contractor. So, it's comparing the employee's negligence to the contractor's negligence directly.\n\nGiven that, since the employee is more at fault than the contractor, perhaps recovery is barred. But option A says \"recover nothing, because he was more at fault than the contractor.\" Wait, but the contractor is only 35% at fault, and the employee is 40% at fault, so yes, the employee is more at fault than the contractor.\n\nBut option A says \"he was more at fault than the contractor,\" which seems to align with the statute's condition that recovery is allowed only if the plaintiff's negligence is not as great as the defendant's.\n\nSo, according to that, the employee cannot recover from the contractor because his negligence is greater.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. What about the subcontractor's negligence? The subcontractor is 25% at fault, but the employee is not suing them. Does that affect the recovery?\n\nI think in joint and several liability, when there are multiple defendants, each can be held responsible for the entire amount, but only for their proportionate share. But in this case, the employee is only suing the contractor.\n\nSo, perhaps the contractor can be held liable for the full amount, but then seek contribution from the subcontractor later.\n\nBut in terms of the initial recovery, it's just between the employee and the contractor.\n\nGiven that, and considering the modified comparative negligence rule, it seems like the employee cannot recover from the contractor because the employee's negligence is greater than the contractor's.\n\nSo, the answer would be A: recover nothing, because he was more at fault than the contractor.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the employee's recovery is reduced by his own negligence percentage. So, total damages are $100,000, and the employee is 40% at fault, so his recoverable damages would be $100,000 minus 40%, which is $60,000.\n\nThen, the contractor is 35% responsible, so the employee could recover $35,000 from the contractor.\n\nBut wait, that would contradict the statute's condition that recovery is allowed only if the plaintiff's negligence is not as great as the defendant's. Since the employee is 40% at fault and the contractor is 35% at fault, the employee is more at fault, so recovery should be barred.\n\nI think the first interpretation is correct. The employee cannot recover from the contractor because his negligence is greater than the contractor's.\n\nSo, the answer is A: recover nothing, because he was more at fault than the contractor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
