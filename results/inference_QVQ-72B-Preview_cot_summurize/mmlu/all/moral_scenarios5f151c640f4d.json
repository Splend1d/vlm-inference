                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here that's asking me to judge two different scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are whether each scenario is \"wrong\" or \"not wrong,\" and I need to pick one of the four combinations: both wrong, first wrong and second not wrong, first not wrong and second wrong, or neither wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I played fetch with my dog at the park.\"\n\nSo, playing fetch with my dog at the park. That seems pretty innocent to me. Dogs love playing fetch; it's a way for them to exercise and have fun. And doing it at the park is common; lots of people take their dogs there for that purpose. Unless there's some specific rule against it, which I don't think is generally the case, this seems like a perfectly acceptable activity. I can't see any moral issue here.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I baked peanut butter cookies for my daughter's friends.\"\n\nHmm, baking cookies for someone else generally seems like a nice gesture, showing that you care and want to do something special for them. Peanut butter cookies are a classic; lots of people enjoy them. But wait, I know that peanuts can be a serious allergen for some people. In fact, peanut allergies are pretty common, especially among children. So, if I bake peanut butter cookies and give them to my daughter's friends, there's a chance that one of them might have a peanut allergy.\n\nIf that's the case, then providing peanut butter cookies could be a problem. For someone with a severe peanut allergy, even a small amount of peanut can cause a life-threatening reaction. So, in that context, baking peanut butter cookies for a group of children where some might have allergies could be considered irresponsible or morally wrong because it puts someone at risk without their knowledge.\n\nOn the other hand, if I know for sure that none of my daughter's friends have peanut allergies, or if I've taken precautions to make sure that only those who can safely eat peanuts receive the cookies, then it's not wrong. But assuming I don't have that information, or if I haven't checked, then there's a potential moral issue here.\n\nSo, considering that, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I think that playing fetch with my dog at the park is not wrong, but baking peanut butter cookies for my daughter's friends could be wrong if I haven't considered the possibility of allergies.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"clearly morally wrong.\" Is baking peanut butter cookies for children without knowing their allergies clearly morally wrong? I mean, a lot of people might not think about allergies when baking cookies for others, especially if it's for friends they know. But given the severity of potential allergic reactions, maybe it is considered clearly wrong.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If someone were to bake cookies without considering the dietary restrictions or allergies of the people who might eat them, is that morally wrong? Well, it depends on whether they should have known better. If they had no reason to suspect that anyone had allergies, then maybe it's not clearly wrong. But given that peanut allergies are well-known and potentially life-threatening, perhaps there is an expectation to at least ask or check before giving out peanut-containing treats.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the better approach is to always consider possible allergies and offer safe alternatives, especially when dealing with children. So, in that sense, not considering the risk could be seen as negligent or morally questionable.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at this.\n\nIs there any way that playing fetch with my dog at the park could be considered wrong? Well, maybe if I was being inconsiderate to others, like if my dog is aggressive or not good with other dogs or people, but the scenario doesn't specify that. It just says I played fetch with my dog, which is generally a harmless and positive activity.\n\nOn the other side, baking peanut butter cookies for my daughter's friends could be seen as wrong because it involves a risk to someone's health due to possible allergies, especially since children are a group known for having higher rates of peanut allergies.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
