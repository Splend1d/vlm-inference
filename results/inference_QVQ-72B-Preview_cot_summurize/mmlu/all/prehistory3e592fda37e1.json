Anthropology is holistic and integrative in its approach.\n\nB. Anthropology is less holistic and more theoretical in its approach.\n\nC. Anthropology tends to focus on specific topics in history.\n\nD. Anthropology is more narrowly focused than the other social sciences.\n\nHmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what anthropology is. From what I recall, anthropology is the study of humans and their societies, cultures, and behaviors. It looks at things like social structures, cultural practices, and biological evolution.\n\nNow, economics is about how people make choices and allocate resources, right? Sociology focuses on social behavior and the organization of societies.\n\nSo, comparing these, maybe anthropology is more broad because it looks at multiple aspects of human life, including cultural, social, and biological dimensions.\n\nOption A says anthropology is holistic and integrative. Holistic means looking at the whole picture, not just parts. Integrative suggests combining different fields or approaches. That sounds like anthropology tries to understand humans in a comprehensive way, considering various factors that influence human behavior and society.\n\nOption B says the opposite: less holistic and more theoretical. That doesn't seem right, because I think anthropology is known for its holistic approach.\n\nOption C says anthropology focuses on specific topics in history. While anthropology does look at history, especially cultural history, it's not solely focused on specific historical topics. It's more about understanding human cultures and societies in a broader sense.\n\nOption D says anthropology is more narrowly focused than other social sciences. But that contradicts what I know about anthropology being holistic.\n\nI think the correct answer is A. Anthropology is holistic and integrative in its approach.\n\nLet me double-check. Holistic means considering all aspects together, and integrative means combining different disciplines or perspectives. Anthropology does that by incorporating cultural, social, linguistic, and biological perspectives.\n\nEconomics, on the other hand, is more specialized in economic activities and resource allocation. Sociology focuses specifically on social structures and processes.\n\nSo, yes, anthropology seems to have a broader, more holistic scope that integrates multiple aspects of human life.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
