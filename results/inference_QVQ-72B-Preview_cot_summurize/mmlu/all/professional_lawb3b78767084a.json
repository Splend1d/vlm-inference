                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, there's this guy who needs his car's oil changed. He plans to take it to the dealership but mentions to his neighbor that he's going. The neighbor offers to change the oil for $50 over the weekend, and he agrees. But then, on Sunday, the neighbor hasn't started the job yet and decides that $50 isn't enough. The man, needing his car for work on Monday, offers an extra $25 if the neighbor can finish the job by Sunday evening and also promises not to sue for breach of the original agreement. The neighbor does the job, but when it comes time to pay, the man only gives $50. Now, the neighbor is suing for the extra $25. The question is, in this lawsuit, will the neighbor win?\n\nOkay, so first, let's understand the contracts here. There are two agreements between the man and his neighbor.\n\nThe first agreement: Neighbor changes the oil for $50.\n\nThe second agreement: If the neighbor changes the oil by Monday morning, the man will pay $75 in total and won't sue for breach of the first agreement.\n\nNow, the neighbor is trying to get the extra $25 based on the second agreement.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Win, because she performed her part of the bargain.\n\nB. Win, because the second contract for $75 superseded the original $50 contract.\n\nC. Lose, because the $75 contract did not supersede the $50 contract.\n\nD. Lose, because the neighbor had a pre-existing duty to change the oil in the car for $50.\n\nHmm, pre-existing duty sounds familiar. Is this about the pre-existing duty doctrine?\n\nLet me recall: The pre-existing duty rule generally states that if a party agrees to do something they are already contractually obligated to do, that promise isn't sufficient consideration for a new contract.\n\nIn this case, the neighbor was already obligated to change the oil for $50 under the first agreement. So, when the man offered an extra $25 for the neighbor to do what she was already supposed to do, is that sufficient consideration?\n\nWait, but the second agreement added a time constraint: the oil had to be changed by Monday morning. So, it's not just the same obligation; there's an additional requirement of timing.\n\nDoes that change things? Maybe the second agreement modified the first by adding a time constraint and a higher payment.\n\nAlso, the man promised not to sue for breach of the first agreement. That seems like a significant part of the second agreement.\n\nIn contract law, a contract can be modified with new consideration. The promise not to sue might be considered new consideration for the increased payment.\n\nBut, according to the pre-existing duty rule, performing a contractual duty doesn't normally constitute new consideration unless there's something extra.\n\nHere, the extra is the time constraint and the promise not to sue.\n\nWait, but the neighbor didn't perform the first contract; she was about to breach it by not changing the oil over the weekend.\n\nSo, the second agreement was made when the neighbor was in danger of breaching the first agreement.\n\nThe man, to induce performance, offered more money and also released the neighbor from potential liability for breach of the first agreement.\n\nIn such a situation, the second agreement might be enforceable because the neighbor was in a different position due to her potential breach.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If someone is about to breach a contract, and then agrees to perform in exchange for additional compensation, is that enforceable?\n\nI think the key here is whether the second agreement is made in good faith and whether there's new consideration.\n\nThe man offered $25 more and promised not to sue, and the neighbor agreed to perform by a certain time.\n\nIt seems like both sides are giving something new: the man is giving more money and releasing from potential liability, and the neighbor is agreeing to perform by a specific time.\n\nIn legal terms, this might be seen as a new contract that supersedes the old one.\n\nWait, but option C says the $75 contract did not supersede the $50 contract.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps the original $50 contract still stands, and the neighbor is only entitled to $50.\n\nBut the man explicitly said, \"I realize $50 is low... if you can change the oil in my car by tomorrow morning, I'll pay you an additional $25. And I won't sue you in small claims court for your failure to perform your promise.\"\n\nSo, it seems like the man is offering a new deal: $75 total, provided the oil is changed by Monday morning, and he won't sue for the previous non-performance.\n\nThe neighbor then changes the oil late Sunday afternoon, which meets the condition of being done by Monday morning.\n\nTherefore, it appears that the neighbor performed under the second agreement.\n\nBut the man only pays $50, breaching the second agreement.\n\nSo, in a lawsuit by the neighbor to recover the additional $25, would the neighbor win?\n\nOption A says win because she performed her part of the bargain.\n\nOption B says win because the second contract superseded the original $50 contract.\n\nOption C says lose because the $75 contract did not supersede the $50 contract.\n\nOption D says lose because the neighbor had a pre-existing duty to change the oil for $50.\n\nHmm.\n\nI think the key here is whether the second agreement superseded the first one.\n\nFrom the dialogue, it seems like the man is offering a new deal that replaces the old one.\n\nHe's saying, \"I realize $50 is low... if you do it by tomorrow morning, I'll pay $75, and I won't sue you for not doing it before.\"\n\nSo, it's like they're making a new agreement that cancels the old one.\n\nIf that's the case, then the neighbor is entitled to $75 if she performs by Monday morning, which she did.\n\nTherefore, the neighbor should win, either per option A or option B.\n\nBut option C says lose because the $75 contract did not supersede the $50 contract.\n\nIf that's true, then the neighbor is only entitled to $50, and the man doesn't owe the extra $25.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right, because the second agreement seems to replace the first one.\n\nOption D mentions the pre-existing duty doctrine, which might apply if the neighbor was simply agreeing to do what she was already obligated to do without any new consideration.\n\nBut in this scenario, the neighbor was about to breach the first agreement by not changing the oil over the weekend.\n\nThe man offered additional compensation and a release from potential liability in exchange for the neighbor's promise to perform by Monday morning.\n\nThis seems like a valid modification of the original agreement with new consideration provided by both parties.\n\nTherefore, the neighbor should be entitled to the $75 as per the second agreement.\n\nSo, the neighbor should win, either because she performed her part of the bargain (option A) or because the second contract superseded the original $50 contract (option B).\n\nBut between A and B, option B is more accurate because it refers to the second contract superseding the first, which is what seems to have happened.\n\nOption A is too vague; it just says she performed her part of the bargain, but doesn't specify which agreement.\n\nOption B is clearer: the second contract for $75 replaced the original $50 contract.\n\nTherefore, the neighbor should win because the second contract superseded the original $50 contract, and she performed as per the second contract.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\nWait, but option C says lose because the $75 contract did not supersede the $50 contract.\n\nIf that were the case, then the neighbor would only be entitled to $50, and the man wouldn't owe the extra $25.\n\nBut based on the dialogue, it seems like the second agreement was intended to replace the first one.\n\nThe man is explicitly offering $75 instead of $50, provided the work is done by Monday morning, and he won't sue for the previous non-performance.\n\nSo, it's a new deal that cancels the old one.\n\nTherefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D refers to the pre-existing duty doctrine, but in this case, the neighbor was about to breach the first agreement, and the second agreement was made in that context, with new considerations provided by both parties.\n\nTherefore, the pre-existing duty doctrine shouldn't apply here.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B: win, because the second contract for $75 superseded the original $50 contract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
