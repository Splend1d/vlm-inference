                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a virus spreading in a town. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nThere are 1,000 people in the town, and on January 1st, 10 people have the virus. The number of people infected doubles every 3 days. I need to find out the earliest date when the entire town will be infected.\n\nOkay, so it's an exponential growth problem. The number of infected people doubles every 3 days. Starting with 10 people.\n\nLet me recall the formula for exponential growth. It's something like P(t) = P0 * (r)^t, where P0 is the initial population, r is the growth rate, and t is time.\n\nBut in this case, it's doubling every 3 days. So, maybe I can express it as P(t) = P0 * 2^(t/3), where t is in days.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Starting with P0 = 10, and I want to find when P(t) >= 1000.\n\nSo, set up the equation: 10 * 2^(t/3) >= 1000.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 10: 2^(t/3) >= 100.\n\nNow, to solve for t, I can take the logarithm of both sides. Let's use natural logs for now.\n\nln(2^(t/3)) >= ln(100).\n\nUsing logarithm properties, (t/3)*ln(2) >= ln(100).\n\nSo, t/3 >= ln(100)/ln(2).\n\nI can calculate ln(100)/ln(2). Let's see, ln(100) is about 4.60517, and ln(2) is about 0.69315.\n\nSo, ln(100)/ln(2) \u2248 4.60517 / 0.69315 \u2248 6.64386.\n\nTherefore, t/3 >= 6.64386, so t >= 3*6.64386 \u2248 19.9315 days.\n\nSince t needs to be greater than or equal to approximately 19.9315 days, and it has to be a whole number of days, it would be on the 20th day after January 1st.\n\nWait, but the options are dates, so I need to find out what date is 19 or 20 days after January 1st.\n\nJanuary 1st is day 1, so day 20 is January 20th.\n\nBut the options are January 10th, January 21st, January 31st, and February 10th.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to consider that the virus doubles every 3 days, but perhaps there's a better way to count the days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of how many times the virus doubles to reach 1000.\n\nStarting with 10 infected people:\n\nDay 0: 10\n\nDay 3: 20\n\nDay 6: 40\n\nDay 9: 80\n\nDay 12: 160\n\nDay 15: 320\n\nDay 18: 640\n\nDay 21: 1280\n\nSo, on day 21, it surpasses 1000.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation gave me approximately 20 days, and this step-by-step doubling also points to day 21.\n\nBut 21 days after January 1st would be January 21st.\n\nLooking back at the options, January 21st is option B.\n\nBut let's double-check if day 21 is indeed when the entire town is infected.\n\nStarting with 10 people on January 1st.\n\nAfter 3 days (January 4th): 20 infected.\n\nAfter 6 days (January 7th): 40 infected.\n\nAfter 9 days (January 10th): 80 infected.\n\nAfter 12 days (January 13th): 160 infected.\n\nAfter 15 days (January 16th): 320 infected.\n\nAfter 18 days (January 19th): 640 infected.\n\nAfter 21 days (January 21st): 1280 infected.\n\nSo, on January 21st, the number of infected people becomes 1280, which is more than the town's population of 1000. That means the entire town is infected by this date at the latest.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the earliest date when the entire town is infected, which would be when the number of infected people reaches or exceeds 1000.\n\nFrom the above, on January 18th, 640 are infected, which is less than 1000, and on January 21st, 1280 are infected, which is more than 1000.\n\nSo, the entire town is infected by January 21st.\n\nBut is there a possibility that it reaches 1000 before January 21st?\n\nWait, maybe on day 21, it surpasses 1000, but perhaps on day 20, it doesn't reach exactly 1000.\n\nFrom the exponential growth formula, it's a continuous function, so it could be that at some point between day 18 and day 21, the number of infected reaches 1000.\n\nLet's plug t=18 into the formula: 10 * 2^(18/3) = 10 * 2^6 = 10 * 64 = 640, which is less than 1000.\n\nAt t=21: 10 * 2^(21/3) = 10 * 2^7 = 10 * 128 = 1280, which is more than 1000.\n\nSo, the exact time when the number of infected reaches 1000 would be between day 18 and day 21.\n\nBut since the problem likely expects whole days, and by day 21, it's definitely over 1000, January 21st is the earliest date given the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the virus doubles every 3 days, and see if there's a way to interpolate within those 3 days.\n\nBut given the options, January 21st seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but option A is January 10th, which corresponds to day 9, where we have 80 infected, which is less than 1000.\n\nOption C is January 31st, which is day 31, where the virus would have doubled many more times, far exceeding 1000.\n\nOption D is February 10th, which is even later.\n\nSo, based on the calculations, January 21st seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect this.\n\nIs the population constant? The problem says \"the population of a town\", assuming no one is leaving or entering the town.\n\nIs the virus spreading uniformly, doubling every 3 days? Yes, that's given.\n\nAre there any other constraints? No, besides the town having 365 days in a year and January having 31 days, but that shouldn't affect the calculation.\n\nTherefore, the earliest date when the entire town would be infected is January 21st.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. January 21st}} \\]"
