To find the total number of necklaces they made, I need to add Ken's necklaces and Tami's necklaces together.\n\nSo, Ken has 25 necklaces, and Tami has 25 plus m necklaces. Adding them up: 25 plus (25 plus m). That should be the total.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 25 + (25 + m)\n\nB. 25 + 25m\n\nC. 25 + m\n\nD. 25m\n\nHmm, let's check each one.\n\nOption A is 25 plus the sum of 25 and m, which matches what I just thought. So, that seems correct.\n\nOption B is 25 plus 25m. But wait, Tami makes m more necklaces than Ken, not 25 times m. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C is just 25 plus m. But that doesn't account for Ken's 25 necklaces and Tami's additional m necklaces properly. It's missing Ken's necklaces.\n\nOption D is 25m. That would mean Ken's necklaces times m, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems to be the correct expression for the total number of necklaces Ken and Tami made together.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Let's see: Ken has 25, Tami has 25 plus m. Total should be 25 plus (25 plus m), which is 50 plus m. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about specific numbers, suppose m is 3. Then Tami makes 25 plus 3, which is 28 necklaces. Total necklaces would be 25 plus 28, which is 53. So, plugging m=3 into the expressions:\n\nA. 25 + (25 + 3) = 53\n\nB. 25 + 25*3 = 25 + 75 = 100, which is not 53\n\nC. 25 + 3 = 28, which is not 53\n\nD. 25*3 = 75, which is not 53\n\nSo, indeed, option A is the correct one.\n\nI think that's it. The answer is A. 25 + (25 + m).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A}\\]"
