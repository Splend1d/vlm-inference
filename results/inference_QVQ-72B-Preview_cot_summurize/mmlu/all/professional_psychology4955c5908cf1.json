                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this rational-economic model of decision-making. It sounds pretty straightforward, but I want to make sure I'm getting it right. Let's see, the question is asking about the assumption behind this model.\n\nOption A says that decision-makers place more emphasis on the costs of certain decisions than on other consequences. Hmm, that seems a bit off. I thought the rational-economic model assumes that decision-makers consider all relevant factors, not just costs, but also benefits and other consequences. Maybe this isn't the core assumption.\n\nOption B suggests that decision-makers have complete information about all alternatives and their consequences before making decisions. This sounds familiar. In economics, we often assume that rational decision-makers have perfect information, meaning they know everything there is to know about their options. That seems like a key assumption of the rational-economic model.\n\nOption C mentions that individuals are better than groups at making decisions, especially under stressful conditions. Wait, is that part of the rational-economic model? I don't think so. Actually, the rational-economic model doesn't really specify whether individuals or groups are better; it's more about the process of maximizing utility or profit based on available information. Maybe this is more related to behavioral economics or decision-making theories that consider group dynamics.\n\nOption D states that decision-makers' knowledge about possible alternatives is always incomplete. This seems to contradict what I know about the rational-economic model. If the model assumes complete information, then having incomplete knowledge would be at odds with that assumption.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option B is the correct answer. The rational-economic model assumes that decision-makers have complete information about all alternatives and their consequences before making decisions.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about this again. In the rational-economic model, decision-makers are typically assumed to be rational actors who seek to maximize their utility or profit given the information available to them. This implies that they have a clear understanding of all possible options and their outcomes.\n\nOption A seems to suggest a bias towards considering costs over other consequences, which doesn't align with the comprehensive approach of the rational-economic model. Decision-makers in this model are supposed to consider all relevant factors, not just costs.\n\nOption C brings up the comparison between individuals and groups, which isn't directly related to the rational-economic model's assumptions. While group decision-making can be complex and may involve different processes, the basic rational-economic model focuses more on the individual decision-maker with perfect information.\n\nOption D contradicts the assumption of complete information. If knowledge about alternatives is incomplete, that would introduce uncertainty into the decision-making process, which isn't in line with the rational-economic model's premise of perfect information.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement among the options is B: decision-makers have complete information about all alternatives and their consequences before making decisions.\n\nWait a minute, but in reality, we rarely have complete information. Doesn't this make the rational-economic model somewhat idealized or unrealistic? Yes, that's a common critique of the model. It's often seen as a theoretical ideal that doesn't perfectly reflect real-world decision-making, where information is limited and imperfect. However, for the purposes of this question, the assumption is that decision-makers have complete information.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the rational-economic model assumes that decision-makers are fully informed about all possible options and their outcomes, allowing them to make choices that maximize their utility or profit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
