                    "text": "\nAlright, I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two positive integers, x and y, and their product is 56. Also, x is less than y. And then there's this equation involving their reciprocals: seven times the reciprocal of the smaller integer plus 14 times the reciprocal of the larger integer equals 4. I need to find the value of x.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the possible pairs of positive integers (x, y) where x < y and x * y = 56. Let's list the factors of 56.\n\nThe factors of 56 are: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56.\n\nSo, possible pairs where x < y are:\n\n(1, 56), (2, 28), (4, 14), (7, 8).\n\nNow, I need to check which of these pairs satisfy the second condition: 7 times the reciprocal of the smaller integer plus 14 times the reciprocal of the larger integer equals 4.\n\nLet's test each pair one by one.\n\nFirst pair: (1, 56)\n\nSo, x = 1 and y = 56.\n\nCalculate:\n\n7*(1/1) + 14*(1/56) = 7 + (14/56) = 7 + 0.25 = 7.25, which is not equal to 4.\n\nSo, this pair doesn't work.\n\nSecond pair: (2, 28)\n\nx = 2, y = 28.\n\nCalculate:\n\n7*(1/2) + 14*(1/28) = 7/2 + 14/28 = 3.5 + 0.5 = 4.\n\nOh, this equals 4. That matches the condition.\n\nBut wait, let's check the other pairs to make sure.\n\nThird pair: (4, 14)\n\nx = 4, y = 14.\n\nCalculate:\n\n7*(1/4) + 14*(1/14) = 7/4 + 14/14 = 1.75 + 1 = 2.75, which is not equal to 4.\n\nFourth pair: (7, 8)\n\nx = 7, y = 8.\n\nCalculate:\n\n7*(1/7) + 14*(1/8) = 1 + 14/8 = 1 + 1.75 = 2.75, which is also not equal to 4.\n\nSo, only the second pair, (2, 28), satisfies the condition.\n\nTherefore, x = 2.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 13\n\nB. 14\n\nC. 1\n\nD. 2\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 2.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to approach this problem without listing all possible pairs.\n\nLet me think algebraically.\n\nWe have x * y = 56, with x < y, and 7*(1/x) + 14*(1/y) = 4.\n\nI can rewrite the equation as:\n\n7/y + 14/x = 4.\n\nWait, no, since x is the smaller integer, and y is the larger one.\n\nWait, actually, in the problem, it says seven times the reciprocal of the smaller integer plus 14 times the reciprocal of the larger integer equals 4.\n\nSo, if x < y, then the reciprocal of the smaller integer is 1/x, and the reciprocal of the larger integer is 1/y.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n7*(1/x) + 14*(1/y) = 4.\n\nAnd we know that x * y = 56.\n\nMaybe I can express y in terms of x: y = 56/x.\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\n7*(1/x) + 14*(1/(56/x)) = 4.\n\nSimplify:\n\n7/x + 14*(x/56) = 4.\n\nWait, 1/(56/x) is x/56.\n\nSo, it's 7/x + 14*(x/56) = 4.\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\n14*(x/56) = (14/56)*x = (1/4)*x.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n7/x + x/4 = 4.\n\nTo combine these terms, find a common denominator, which is 4x:\n\n(7/x)*(4/4) + (x/4)*(x/x) = 4.\n\nSo, 28/(4x) + x\u00b2/(4x) = 4.\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\n(28 + x\u00b2)/(4x) = 4.\n\nThen, multiply both sides by 4x:\n\n28 + x\u00b2 = 16x.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nx\u00b2 - 16x + 28 = 0.\n\nNow, solve this quadratic equation for x.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [16 \u00b1 sqrt(256 - 112)] / 2\n\n= [16 \u00b1 sqrt(144)] / 2\n\n= [16 \u00b1 12] / 2\n\nSo, x = (16 + 12)/2 = 28/2 = 14, or x = (16 - 12)/2 = 4/2 = 2.\n\nSo, x = 14 or x = 2.\n\nBut earlier, when I plugged in x = 14 and y = 8, the equation gave 2.75, which is not equal to 4.\n\nWait, but according to the quadratic, x = 2 and x = 14 are both solutions.\n\nBut in the list of pairs, x = 2 and y = 28 worked, but x = 14 and y = 8 did not.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming y = 56/x.\n\nWait, if x and y are both positive integers and x < y, and x * y = 56, then y = 56/x is correct.\n\nBut in the pair (14, 8), x = 14 and y = 8, but 14 is not less than 8.\n\nWait a minute, in the pair (14, 8), x = 14 and y = 8, but 14 > 8, which violates x < y.\n\nSo, x cannot be 14 because x is supposed to be less than y.\n\nTherefore, only x = 2 and y = 28 satisfy both x < y and x * y = 56.\n\nHence, x = 2 is the only valid solution.\n\nThis confirms the earlier conclusion.\n\nSo, the answer is D. 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D}\\ ]"
