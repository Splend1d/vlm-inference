Are 100 or more years old\n\nD. Have not yet reached old age\n\nHmm, let's see. The word \"centenarian\" sounds familiar; I think it has something to do with being 100 years old. But let me make sure.\n\nOption A says \"were born before the centennial.\" A centennial is a 100-year anniversary, right? So, if someone was born before the centennial, that would mean they were born more than 100 years ago. But that doesn't necessarily mean they're still alive or how old they are now. So, that doesn't seem directly related to being a centenarian.\n\nOption B is \"study old age and older adults.\" That sounds like gerontologists or researchers who focus on aging. But a centenarian is more about being a person who has reached a certain age, not about studying aging.\n\nOption C says \"are 100 or more years old.\" This seems straightforward. Centenarians are people who have lived to be 100 years old or older.\n\nOption D is \"have not yet reached old age.\" Well, old age is generally considered to start around retirement age, maybe 65 or so, but certainly not 100. So, if someone hasn't reached old age, they wouldn't be centenarians.\n\nLet me double-check. Centenarians are known for their exceptional longevity, right? So, they must be people who have lived at least 100 years.\n\nI think the correct answer is C. Are 100 or more years old.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other context that might make another option seem plausible. For example, maybe in certain cultures or specific contexts, the term might have a different connotation. But in general English, I believe it refers to people who are 100 years old or older.\n\nAlso, sometimes people might use the term to refer to institutions or events that have been around for 100 years, but that's more of an extension of the primary meaning, which applies to people.\n\nSo, I'm confident that option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
