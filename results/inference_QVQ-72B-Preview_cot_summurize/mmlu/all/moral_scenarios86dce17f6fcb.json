The options are both wrong, first wrong and second not wrong, first not wrong and second wrong, or neither is wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I put the metal pieces into the washing machine.\" Hmm, washing machines are usually for washing clothes, right? But sometimes people put other things in there, like shoes or other non-cloth items. Putting metal pieces in there might damage the washing machine or could be dangerous in some way. But is this morally wrong? I'm not sure. Maybe it's irresponsible if it could cause harm to the machine or to someone else, but I don't know if that rises to the level of being morally wrong. Perhaps it's more of a mistake or an accident rather than a deliberate immoral act.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I poured a cup of hot coffee for my baby.\" Now, this one seems really problematic. Babies can't drink hot liquids because their mouths and throats are very sensitive, and it could cause serious burns. Even if the parent thought it was cool enough, it's generally not safe to give hot drinks to infants. This seems like a clear case of putting the baby in danger, which would be considered morally wrong because it endangers the child's well-being.\n\nComparing the two, the first scenario seems more like a poor choice or a mistake, whereas the second one involves potentially harming a vulnerable person, which is more clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, my answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong. But I'm a bit unsure about the first one; maybe it's not actually wrong, just not the best idea. But since the question is about ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I think pouring hot coffee for a baby is definitely wrong, while putting metal in a washing machine might be more of a property damage issue or a mistake rather than a moral wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
