                    "text": "So here's this situation: A husband and wife are going on vacation for a month and they want to get new carpeting installed in their home while they're away. They hire a carpeting company to do the job for $7,000, give them a set of keys, and off they go. A week later, the carpeting company realizes they're overbooked and can't do all the jobs they've contracted. So, they contact a workman they've worked with before and ask him to do the installation for the husband and wife. The workman agrees, does the job, and when the couple comes back, they're happy with the work and send the $7,000 to the carpeting company, which deposits the check.\n\nNow, the question is: If the workman wants to get paid for the services he provided, who does he recover from? The options are:\n\nA. Recover against the husband and wife only.\n\nB. Recover against the carpeting company only.\n\nC. Recover against either the husband and wife or the carpeting company.\n\nD. Not recover, because he was not in privity of contract.\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, there's a contract between the husband and wife and the carpeting company. The couple agrees to pay $7,000 for the carpet installation, and they give the keys to the carpeting company. So, the direct contract is between these two parties.\n\nThen, the carpeting company subcontracts the job to a workman because they're overbooked. They probably have an agreement with the workman, maybe\u53e3\u5934\u7684 or written, where they agree to pay him for doing the job.\n\nThe workman does the job, and the couple comes back and pays the carpeting company the $7,000, which is deposited.\n\nNow, the workman wants to get paid. But who does he go to?\n\nOption A says he can only recover against the husband and wife. But wait, the husband and wife didn't contract directly with the workman. They contracted with the carpeting company. So, the workman isn't in privity of contract with the couple. That might be a problem.\n\nOption B says he can only recover against the carpeting company. That makes sense because the carpeting company hired him to do the job. They probably have a direct agreement or understanding about payment.\n\nOption C says he can recover against either the husband and wife or the carpeting company. That seems a bit too broad. The direct contract is between the carpeting company and the workman, not between the workman and the couple.\n\nOption D says he can't recover because he's not in privity of contract. Well, that's not entirely accurate. While he's not in privity with the couple, he is in privity with the carpeting company.\n\nBut let's think about this more carefully.\n\nThe carpeting company hired the workman to do the job. So, there's a contractual relationship there, even if it's not explicitly stated in the question. The workman did the work, and presumably, there was an understanding that he would be paid for it.\n\nThe couple paid the carpeting company, assuming that the carpeting company would handle all aspects of the job, including paying any subcontractors.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the workman should look to the carpeting company for payment because that's who he had the direct agreement with.\n\nIf the carpeting company didn't pay him, that's between the workman and the carpeting company. The couple has already paid the carpeting company, so they've fulfilled their obligation under the contract.\n\nTherefore, the workman should recover against the carpeting company only.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any way the workman could go after the couple for payment.\n\nWell, the couple benefited from the work done by the workman, but they didn't have a direct contract with him. So, generally, without a direct contract, the workman can't sue the couple for payment.\n\nHowever, there might be some exceptions, like if the couple knew that the carpeting company was subcontracting the work and had some agreement with the workman, but that's not indicated in the question.\n\nAlso, if the carpeting company was acting as an agent for the couple, then perhaps the couple could be liable, but again, the question doesn't suggest that.\n\nMoreover, the couple has already paid the carpeting company, so they've discharged their obligation.\n\nTherefore, the workman's best course of action is to seek payment from the carpeting company.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Recover against the carpeting company only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
