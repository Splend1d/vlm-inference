                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which laboratory procedure the technician used to detect CMV DNA in the blood of a bone marrow transplant recipient. The scenario describes a process where DNA from the patient's leukocytes is reacted with oligonucleotides specific for CMV DNA, thermostable DNA polymerase, and nucleotides. Then, repetitive cycles of heating and cooling are performed, followed by detection of the reaction product via gel electrophoresis.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means and how they relate to the procedures listed in the options.\n\nStarting with the components used in the reaction:\n\n- Oligonucleotides: These are short sequences of DNA or RNA that can bind to complementary sequences. In this case, they are specific for CMV DNA, so they should bind to particular regions of the CMV genome.\n\n- Thermostable DNA polymerase: This is an enzyme that can replicate DNA at high temperatures without being denatured. It's commonly used in PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) because PCR involves cycles of heating and cooling.\n\n- Nucleotides: These are the building blocks of DNA and RNA. In this context, they are probably deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs: dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP), which are needed for synthesizing new DNA strands.\n\nThe process mentioned involves repetitive cycles of heating and cooling, which sounds a lot like the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique. PCR is a method widely used to amplify specific DNA sequences through cycles of denaturation (heating), annealing (cooling), and extension (synthesis of new DNA strands using DNA polymerase).\n\nAfter the cycles are completed, the reaction product is detected by gel electrophoresis. Gel electrophoresis is a technique that separates DNA fragments based on their size and charge, allowing researchers to visualize and analyze the amplified DNA fragments.\n\nNow, let's consider each option:\n\nA. Northern blotting: This is a method used to detect specific RNA molecules in a sample. It involves separating RNA by gel electrophoresis and then transferring the RNA to a membrane for detection using a labeled probe. Since the scenario mentions DNA and not RNA, this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nB. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR): As I thought earlier, the description matches PCR perfectly. PCR is used to amplify DNA sequences, and it involves the use of oligonucleotide primers, thermostable DNA polymerase, and nucleotides, all subjected to cycles of heating and cooling.\n\nC. Reverse transcription: This process converts RNA into DNA using reverse transcriptase. It's often used in conjunction with PCR when dealing with RNA viruses or analyzing gene expression. However, since the scenario specifies DNA from leukocytes and oligonucleotides specific for CMV DNA, which is a DNA virus, reverse transcription might not be necessary unless there's a specific reason to suspect RNA involvement.\n\nD. Southern blotting: This is a technique used to detect specific DNA sequences in a sample. It involves digesting DNA with restriction enzymes, separating the fragments by gel electrophoresis, and then transferring them to a membrane for detection using a probe. While gel electrophoresis is mentioned in the scenario, the primary procedure described sounds more like PCR, which directly amplifies the DNA region of interest without the need for restriction enzymes in this context.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely procedure used by the technician is PCR (Option B). The other options either don't match the description or involve different techniques not aligned with the processes outlined in the scenario.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider the step-by-step process of PCR:\n\n1. Denaturation: The DNA double helix is separated into single strands by heating.\n\n2. Annealing: The temperature is lowered, allowing the oligonucleotide primers to bind to the complementary sequences on the single-stranded DNA.\n\n3. Extension: DNA polymerase synthesizes new DNA strands using the nucleotides provided, starting from the primers.\n\nThis cycle repeats multiple times, exponentially amplifying the target DNA sequence. The final product can then be visualized via gel electrophoresis, which matches perfectly with the description in the scenario.\n\nIn contrast, Northern blotting and Southern blotting are detection methods that involve transferring nucleic acids from a gel to a membrane and probing for specific sequences, which isn't the primary focus of the described procedure.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Polymerase chain reaction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
