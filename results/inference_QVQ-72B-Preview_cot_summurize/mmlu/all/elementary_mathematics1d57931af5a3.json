                    "text": "So I've got this problem here that asks me to order some numbers from least to greatest. The numbers are fractions and decimals, which can be a bit tricky sometimes, but I think I can handle it. Let's see what I've got:\n\nOption A: 1/8, 0.75, 1/3, 5/6\n\nOption B: 5/6, 1/3, 0.75, 1/8\n\nOption C: 1/8, 1/3, 0.75, 5/6\n\nOption D: 5/6, 0.75, 1/3, 1/8\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to figure out which of these sequences orders the numbers from the smallest to the largest. To do that, I should probably convert all these numbers to the same form, either all fractions or all decimals, so I can easily compare them.\n\nI think I'll convert everything to decimals since I'm pretty comfortable with decimals.\n\nLet's start with the fractions:\n\n1/8: To convert this to a decimal, I can divide 1 by 8. 1 divided by 8 is 0.125. So, 1/8 = 0.125.\n\n1/3: This is a common fraction, and I remember that 1/3 is approximately 0.333... repeating.\n\n0.75: This is already a decimal, so no need to convert it. It's 0.75.\n\n5/6: To convert this to a decimal, I can divide 5 by 6. 5 divided by 6 is approximately 0.833... repeating.\n\nSo now, I have all the numbers in decimal form:\n\n1/8: 0.125\n\n0.75: 0.75\n\n1/3: 0.333...\n\n5/6: 0.833...\n\nNow, I need to arrange these from least to greatest.\n\nLet's list the numbers again:\n\n0.125, 0.75, 0.333..., 0.833...\n\nTo order them from least to greatest, I should start with the smallest and then go to the largest.\n\nSo, the smallest is 0.125, then 0.333..., then 0.75, and finally 0.833...\n\nTherefore, the correct order should be: 0.125, 0.333..., 0.75, 0.833...\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nOption A: 0.125, 0.75, 0.333..., 0.833...\n\nOption B: 0.833..., 0.333..., 0.75, 0.125\n\nOption C: 0.125, 0.333..., 0.75, 0.833...\n\nOption D: 0.833..., 0.75, 0.333..., 0.125\n\nHmm, option C seems to match the correct order I just determined.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I converted the fractions to decimals correctly, I think. 1/8 is indeed 0.125, 1/3 is approximately 0.333, and 5/6 is approximately 0.833.\n\nThe order I have is 0.125, 0.333..., 0.75, 0.833..., which corresponds to 1/8, 1/3, 0.75, 5/6.\n\nLooking at option C: 1/8, 1/3, 0.75, 5/6, which matches my order.\n\nOption A has 1/8, 0.75, 1/3, 5/6, which seems incorrect because 0.75 should come after 1/3.\n\nOption B has 5/6, 1/3, 0.75, 1/8, which is definitely not least to greatest.\n\nOption D has 5/6, 0.75, 1/3, 1/8, which is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider another way to compare them.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert all fractions to have a common denominator and then compare their numerators.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, convert 1/8, 1/3, and 5/6 to decimals with a common denominator.\n\nThe denominators are 8, 3, and 6. The least common multiple (LCM) of 8, 3, and 6 is 24.\n\nSo, let's convert each fraction to have a denominator of 24.\n\n1/8 = (1/8) * (3/3) = 3/24\n\n1/3 = (1/3) * (8/8) = 8/24\n\n5/6 = (5/6) * (4/4) = 20/24\n\nNow, 0.75 is the same as 3/4, which is (3/4) * (6/6) = 18/24.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n1/8 = 3/24\n\n0.75 = 18/24\n\n1/3 = 8/24\n\n5/6 = 20/24\n\nNow, ordering these fractions from least to greatest based on their numerators:\n\n3/24 (1/8), 8/24 (1/3), 18/24 (0.75), 20/24 (5/6)\n\nWhich again confirms the order: 1/8, 1/3, 0.75, 5/6\n\nSo, this matches option C.\n\nI think I'm confident now that option C is the correct one.\n\nJust to be extra sure, maybe I can think about the decimal values again.\n\n0.125 (1/8) is less than 0.333... (1/3), which is less than 0.75, and finally less than 0.833... (5/6).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: 1/8, 1/3, 0.75, 5/6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
