                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about emergency room visit durations. It says that the durations are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 167 minutes and a standard deviation of 76 minutes. And I need to find the interval that contains the middle 80% of the durations, rounded to the nearest minute. The options are:\n\nA. 15 minutes to 319 minutes\n\nB. 53 minutes to 281 minutes\n\nC. 70 minutes to 264 minutes\n\nD. 91 minutes to 243 minutes\n\nAlright, first things first, I know that in a normal distribution, data is symmetrically distributed around the mean. So, the mean is 167 minutes, and the standard deviation is 76 minutes. I need to find the interval that contains the middle 80% of the data points.\n\nI recall that in a normal distribution, the empirical rule, or the 68-95-99.7 rule, tells us that:\n\n- Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean.\n\n- Approximately 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean.\n\n- Approximately 99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations of the mean.\n\nBut here, I need the middle 80%, which isn't one of those standard percentages. So, I need a different approach.\n\nI think I should use the z-score table or the standard normal distribution to find the z-scores that correspond to the cumulative areas of 10% in each tail, because the middle 80% would leave 10% in each tail.\n\nSo, if I look for the z-score that corresponds to a cumulative area of 0.90 (since 100% - 10% = 90%, but wait, no. Actually, for the upper tail, it's 1 - 0.10 = 0.90, and for the lower tail, it's 0.10.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the lower bound corresponds to the 10th percentile and the upper bound corresponds to the 90th percentile in the distribution.\n\nSo, I need to find the z-scores for the 10th percentile and the 90th percentile.\n\nI can look up these values in a standard normal table or use a calculator.\n\nLet me see, the z-score for the 10th percentile is approximately -1.28, and for the 90th percentile, it's about +1.28.\n\nSo, if I have z = 1.28 for the upper limit and z = -1.28 for the lower limit.\n\nNow, the general formula to find the interval bounds is:\n\nLower bound = mean - (z * standard deviation)\n\nUpper bound = mean + (z * standard deviation)\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nLower bound = 167 - (1.28 * 76)\n\nUpper bound = 167 + (1.28 * 76)\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 1.28 * 76.\n\n76 * 1 = 76\n\n76 * 0.28 \u2248 21.28\n\nSo, 76 * 1.28 \u2248 97.28 minutes\n\nThen, lower bound \u2248 167 - 97.28 \u2248 69.72 minutes\n\nUpper bound \u2248 167 + 97.28 \u2248 264.28 minutes\n\nRounding to the nearest minute, that's 70 minutes to 264 minutes.\n\nLooking back at the options, that corresponds to option C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the z-score for the 90th percentile is indeed about 1.28. Similarly, for the 10th percentile, it's -1.28.\n\nThen, calculating 1.28 * 76:\n\n76 * 1 = 76\n\n76 * 0.28:\n\n76 * 0.2 = 15.2\n\n76 * 0.08 = 6.08\n\nAdding up, 15.2 + 6.08 = 21.28\n\nSo, total 76 * 1.28 = 76 + 21.28 = 97.28 minutes\n\nThen, 167 - 97.28 = 69.72 minutes, which rounds to 70 minutes\n\nAnd 167 + 97.28 = 264.28 minutes, which rounds to 264 minutes\n\nSo, the interval is 70 minutes to 264 minutes, which is option C.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might use different z-scores for different percentages, but in this case, 1.28 is the standard value for the 90th percentile.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the inverse normal function on a calculator to find the z-scores that correspond to the cumulative probabilities of 0.10 and 0.90.\n\nSo, z = NORM.S.INV(0.90) would give approximately 1.28, and NORM.S.INV(0.10) would give approximately -1.28.\n\nUsing these z-scores, we again get the same interval.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
