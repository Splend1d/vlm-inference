                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about four identical alternators, each rated at 20 MVA and 11 kV, with a subtransient reactance of 16%. They're working in parallel, and I need to find the short-circuit level at the busbar. The options are 500 MVA, 400 MVA, 125 MVA, or 100 MVA.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a short-circuit level is. I think it refers to the maximum apparent power that the system can supply during a short circuit. So, basically, it's how much current the system can provide when there's a short circuit, usually expressed in MVA.\n\nEach alternator has a subtransient reactance of 16%. Reactance is like resistance in an AC circuit, but it's due to inductance or capacitance. Subtransient reactance is a measure of how much voltage drops across the alternator's winding when there's a sudden change like a short circuit.\n\nThe formula to relate MVA and reactance is something like MVA = V * I / X, where X is the reactance. But since it's a percentage, I need to convert it to actual reactance in ohms or per unit.\n\nFirst, let's find the per-unit reactance. If the subtransient reactance is 16%, that's the same as 0.16 per unit on the machine's base.\n\nThe per-unit reactance formula is:\n\nX_pu = (X_subtransient) / base reactance\n\nBut since it's given as a percentage, and percentage is per unit, I think X_subtransient is already in per unit on the machine's base.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the subtransient reactance is often given as a percentage of the machine's base voltage and base current.\n\nLet me recall: the per-unit reactance is defined as (X_subtransient) / (base reactance), where base reactance is (base voltage)/(base current).\n\nBut in per-unit systems, base reactance can also be expressed as (base voltage)^2 / base MVA.\n\nSo, X_pu = X_subtransient / [(base voltage)^2 / base MVA]\n\nGiven that X_subtransient is 16% or 0.16, base voltage is 11 kV, and base MVA is 20 MVA.\n\nSo, X_pu = 0.16 / [(11)^2 / 20] = 0.16 / [121 / 20] = 0.16 / 6.05 \u2248 0.0264 per unit.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. If the subtransient reactance is 16%, that should be the per-unit value on the machine's base.\n\nMaybe I'm confusing something here.\n\nLet me look up the definition of subtransient reactance.\n\nUpon checking, subtransient reactance (X_d\") is typically given in per unit on the machine's base. So, if it's 16%, that means X_d\" = 0.16 p.u.\n\nNow, to find the short-circuit current, I can use the formula:\n\nI_sc = E / X_d\"\n\nWhere E is the internal voltage of the alternator.\n\nBut in per-unit terms, E is usually 1.0 p.u.\n\nSo, I_sc = 1 / 0.16 = 6.25 p.u.\n\nNow, to find the actual short-circuit current, I need to convert this per-unit current to actual current.\n\nThe per-unit current base is:\n\nI_base = S_base / (sqrt(3) * V_base)\n\nWhere S_base is the base MVA (20 MVA), V_base is the base voltage (11 kV).\n\nSo, I_base = 20 / (sqrt(3) * 11) \u2248 20 / (1.732 * 11) \u2248 20 / 19.052 \u2248 1.049 A per unit.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because per-unit current should be in amperes per unit, but I need to find the short-circuit current in amperes.\n\nAlternatively, the short-circuit MVA can be calculated using the formula:\n\nMVA_sc = (base MVA) / X_pu\n\nWhere X_pu is the per-unit reactance.\n\nGiven that X_pu = 0.16, then MVA_sc = 20 / 0.16 = 125 MVA for one alternator.\n\nBut there are four alternators in parallel, so the total short-circuit MVA should be 4 times that, which is 500 MVA.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Maybe there's more to it.\n\nLet me think differently. When alternators are connected in parallel, their short-circuit capacities add up, assuming they are independent sources.\n\nBut in reality, the busbar short-circuit level depends on the internal impedances and how they are connected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the total subtransient reactance seen at the busbar when multiple alternators are in parallel.\n\nThe equivalent subtransient reactance of parallel generators is like resistors in parallel.\n\nSo, if each generator has a subtransient reactance of X_d\" = 0.16 p.u., then the total reactance for four in parallel would be:\n\n1 / X_total = 1/X_d\" + 1/X_d\" + 1/X_d\" + 1/X_d\" = 4 / 0.16 = 25\n\nTherefore, X_total = 0.16 / 4 = 0.04 p.u.\n\nThen, the total short-circuit MVA would be S_base / X_total = 20 / 0.04 = 500 MVA.\n\nThat seems consistent with the earlier calculation.\n\nBut let's verify this approach.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the short-circuit current for one alternator and then multiply by the number of alternators.\n\nFor one alternator:\n\nMVA_sc_per_generator = (E / X_d\") * I_base\n\nWhere E is the internal voltage (1 p.u.), X_d\" is 0.16 p.u., and I_base is the base current.\n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler:\n\nMVA_sc_per_generator = (V_base * I_sc) / sqrt(3)\n\nWhere I_sc = E / X_d\" = 1 / 0.16 = 6.25 p.u.\n\nSo, I_sc = 6.25 * I_base.\n\nBut I_base = S_base / (sqrt(3) * V_base) = 20 / (1.732 * 11) \u2248 1.049 A.\n\nTherefore, I_sc = 6.25 * 1.049 \u2248 6.656 A.\n\nThen, MVA_sc_per_generator = sqrt(3) * V_base * I_sc \u2248 1.732 * 11 * 6.656 \u2248 125 MVA.\n\nSo, for one alternator, it's 125 MVA, and for four in parallel, it should be 4 * 125 = 500 MVA.\n\nThat matches the earlier result.\n\nBut wait, the options include 500 MVA, 400 MVA, 125 MVA, and 100 MVA.\n\nSo, according to this calculation, the answer should be 500 MVA.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's any other consideration I'm missing.\n\nIs there any bus impedance or other factors that could affect the total short-circuit level?\n\nThe problem states that the alternators are working in parallel, but doesn't mention any bus impedance or transformer impedance that might be in series.\n\nAssuming that the busbar connects directly to the alternators without any intervening impedance, then the total short-circuit level should indeed be the sum of the individual short-circuit capacities, which is 500 MVA.\n\nAlternatively, if there were bus impedances or transformers in between, I would need to account for those as well.\n\nGiven the information provided, I think the correct answer is 500 MVA.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{500 \\text{ MVA}}\\]"
