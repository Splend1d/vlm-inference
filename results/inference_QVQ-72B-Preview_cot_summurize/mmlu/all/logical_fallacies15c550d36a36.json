Let's go through them one by one.\n\nOption A says it's \"arguing that something is necessarily bad because it doesn't cost very much.\" Hmm, that sounds like a straw man or maybe a hasty generalization, but I'm not sure if that's exactly the natural law fallacy. Maybe I should look into this more carefully.\n\nOption B mentions \"substituting individual stories for a larger sample when supporting a generalization.\" That sounds a lot like the anecdotal evidence fallacy, where people use personal stories or isolated cases to make broad conclusions. But again, I need to make sure this isn't the natural law fallacy.\n\nOption C says \"arguing that what is true in nature must be true about humans.\" This seems interesting. The natural law fallacy, from what I recall, is sometimes referred to as the appeal to nature fallacy, where people argue that something is good or right because it's found in nature. So, if something occurs naturally, it must be good for humans. That sounds similar to what option C is saying.\n\nOption D claims it's \"the same thing as the post hoc fallacy.\" Post hoc ergo propter hoc is a fallacy that suggests that because one event followed another, the first event caused the second. That's a different type of fallacy from what I think the natural law fallacy is.\n\nSo, between options A, B, C, and D, option C seems to be the closest to my understanding of the natural law fallacy. But to be thorough, let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose someone argues that because wolves live in packs, it's natural for humans to live in societies. That seems like an appeal to nature, assuming that just because something is natural, it should be applied to human behavior. That sounds like the natural law fallacy.\n\nAnother example could be saying that herbal remedies are better than pharmaceutical drugs because they're natural. This assumes that natural equals better or safer, which isn't necessarily true.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C seems to capture this idea: arguing that what is true in nature must be true about humans. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if any of the other options could also be considered forms of the natural law fallacy.\n\nOption A is about arguing something is bad because it's cheap. That sounds more like a circumstantial ad hominem fallacy, attacking an argument based on its cost rather than its merits. It's not directly related to natural laws.\n\nOption B is about using individual stories instead of larger samples to support generalizations. That's anecdotal evidence, which is a different type of fallacy.\n\nOption D equates the natural law fallacy with the post hoc fallacy, which is incorrect, as post hoc deals with mistaken causality.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option C: arguing that what is true in nature must be true about humans.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
