                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out what the court should rule in this declaratory judgment action about the validity of a state statute that prevents aliens from owning commercial real estate. Both aliens are lawful residents, and they're both involved in a contract to buy and sell an office building, which is commercial real estate. They're joining together to challenge this statute in federal court.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a declaratory judgment action is. From what I recall, a declaratory judgment is a legal action where a court determines the rights of parties without ordering any specific action or awarding damages. So, in this case, they're asking the court to declare whether this state statute is valid or not.\n\nNow, the question is about who has the burden of proof and whether both aliens have standing to bring this action.\n\nLet's tackle standing first. Standing is a legal concept that requires a party to have a sufficient connection to and harm from the law or action they are challenging. In this case, both aliens are lawful residents and are directly affected by the statute since it prevents them from owning commercial real estate. So, it seems like both have a direct interest and are being harmed by the statute. Therefore, it makes sense that both have standing to challenge the statute.\n\nLooking at option C, it says the resident aliens do not have standing. Based on my understanding, that doesn't seem correct because they are directly affected by the statute.\n\nOption D says either resident alien has standing, but not both. That doesn't make much sense either because both are being harmed by the statute and should both have standing to challenge it.\n\nSo, I think options C and D are incorrect.\n\nNow, moving on to the burden of proof. In constitutional challenges, especially those involving equal protection or other fundamental rights, the burden of proof can shift depending on the nature of the right being affected.\n\nIn this case, the statute is discriminating based on alienage, which is a suspect classification under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Suspect classifications require strict scrutiny by the courts, meaning the government must show that the law is necessary to achieve a compelling state interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\n\nSo, in such cases, the burden is on the government, not the plaintiffs, to justify the law.\n\nLooking at option A, it says the state has the burden of proof to show that there is a compelling state interest to support the statute. That aligns with what I just thought about strict scrutiny.\n\nOption B says the burden is on the resident aliens to show that there is no compelling state interest to support the statute. That seems backwards because in strict scrutiny, it's the government's job to justify the law, not the plaintiffs' job to disprove it.\n\nTherefore, option A seems correct, and option B is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's something else going on here.\n\nI remember that in declaratory judgment actions, the party seeking the declaration has the burden of proof on the issues they're raising. But in constitutional challenges involving suspect classifications, the standard of review is strict scrutiny, and the burden shifts to the government to justify the classification.\n\nSo, even in a declaratory judgment action, if the challenge is based on a constitutional issue requiring strict scrutiny, the government should bear the burden of justifying the law.\n\nTherefore, option A seems correct.\n\nAdditionally, considering that both aliens have standing, options C and D are incorrect.\n\nSo, the court should rule that the state has the burden of proof to show that there is a compelling state interest to support the statute.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"the court should rule that,\" and then gives options A through D. It seems like maybe the answer is just one of these options, but I need to consider if there's more to it.\n\nPerhaps the court should rule on both standing and the burden of proof. But the way the question is phrased, it says \"the court should rule that,\" and then gives options A through D, each of which is a separate statement.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is A, but maybe there's a different perspective.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other doctrine or principle that might apply here.\n\nFirst, on standing: Both aliens are parties to the contract and are directly affected by the statute. They have a concrete interest in the outcome, so they should both have standing.\n\nOn the burden of proof: In equal protection cases involving suspect classifications, the government bears the burden to show that the classification is necessary to achieve a compelling state interest.\n\nTherefore, option A is correct, and options B, C, and D are incorrect.\n\nI think the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
