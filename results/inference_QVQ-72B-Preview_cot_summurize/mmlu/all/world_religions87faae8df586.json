                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"According to Hindu tradition, who is considered to be the ideal wife?\" And the options are A. Sita, B. Rama, C. Kali, D. Durga. Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out which one is correctly identified as the ideal wife in Hindu tradition.\n\nFirst off, I know that Hinduism has a rich mythology with many gods and goddesses. There are also epic stories like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata that provide a lot of context for these figures. So, probably, the answer is going to come from one of these narratives.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Sita. I recall that Sita is a central character in the Ramayana, which is a major Hindu epic. She is the wife of Rama, who is an avatar of the god Vishnu. Sita is often portrayed as the epitome of virtue, loyalty, and devotion. In fact, she's sometimes referred to as Sita Devi, meaning Goddess Sita, though she's more of a mortal woman who embodies divine qualities. She's highly revered in Hindu culture for her purity and fidelity. So, she seems like a strong candidate for being considered the ideal wife.\n\nNext, Rama. He's the seventh avatar of Vishnu and the main male protagonist of the Ramayana. Rama is known for his righteousness, bravery, and adherence to dharma, or moral law. He's a revered figure in Hinduism, but since he's a male god, it's unlikely that he would be considered the ideal wife. So, probably not the answer.\n\nThen there's Kali. Kali is a Hindu goddess, associated with time, creation, preservation, and destruction. She's often depicted with a dark complexion, wearing a skirt of arms, and a necklace of skulls. Kali is a powerful deity, and while she's an important figure in Hindu pantheon, she's not typically associated with being a wife in the traditional sense. So, I don't think she fits the description of an ideal wife.\n\nLastly, Durga. Durga is another Hindu goddess, known for her warrior-like qualities and her role in defeating demons. She's a manifestation of shakti, or divine feminine energy. Durga is revered for her strength and protective nature, but again, she's more of a warrior goddess rather than being characterized as an ideal wife.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, Sita seems to be the most fitting choice. She's famously known for her unwavering loyalty and virtue as Rama's wife, making her a symbol of the ideal spouse in Hindu tradition.\n\nJust to make sure, I should check if there are any other figures in Hindu mythology who might also be considered ideal wives. For example, there's Parvati, who is Durga's mother and the wife of Shiva. Parvati is also a significant figure, but again, in terms of the question, Sita seems more prominently associated with the qualities of an ideal wife.\n\nAnother figure could be Radha, who is associated with Krishna. Radha is celebrated for her love and devotion to Krishna, but again, Sita's story in the Ramayana places a greater emphasis on her role as a wife and her adherence to wifely duties.\n\nMoreover, in Hindu culture, Sita's character is often used as a standard for women to emulate, especially in terms of marital fidelity and moral uprightness. There are even festivals and traditions dedicated to Sita, such as Sita Navami, which marks her birth and honors her virtues.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I'm confident that Sita is the correct answer to the question of who is considered the ideal wife according to Hindu tradition.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A.
