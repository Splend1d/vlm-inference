                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: I need to find out how many real solutions the equation \\( e^x + x - 2 = 0 \\) has in the interval \\([0, 1]\\), and also how many real solutions are not in that interval. The options are given as A, B, C, and D.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the equation is asking. It says \\( e^x + x - 2 = 0 \\). So, I need to find values of \\( x \\) that satisfy this equation.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation to make it easier to think about. I can write it as \\( e^x + x = 2 \\), or even better, \\( e^x + x - 2 = 0 \\). It's already set to zero, which is good for finding roots.\n\nI know that \\( e^x \\) is the exponential function, which is always positive and increases as \\( x \\) increases. So, \\( e^x \\) starts at 1 when \\( x = 0 \\) and grows larger as \\( x \\) increases.\n\nNow, let's consider the function \\( f(x) = e^x + x - 2 \\). I need to find the number of real solutions to \\( f(x) = 0 \\) in \\([0, 1]\\), and outside of it.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate \\( f(x) \\) at the endpoints of the interval \\([0, 1]\\).\n\nAt \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\( f(0) = e^0 + 0 - 2 = 1 + 0 - 2 = -1 \\)\n\nAt \\( x = 1 \\):\n\n\\( f(1) = e^1 + 1 - 2 = e + 1 - 2 = e - 1 \\)\n\nSince \\( e \\) is approximately 2.718, \\( e - 1 \\) is about 1.718, which is positive.\n\nSo, \\( f(0) = -1 \\) and \\( f(1) = e - 1 \\approx 1.718 \\).\n\nSince \\( f(x) \\) is continuous (because both \\( e^x \\) and \\( x \\) are continuous), and \\( f(0) \\) is negative while \\( f(1) \\) is positive, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be at least one real solution in \\([0, 1]\\).\n\nBut is there only one solution in \\([0, 1]\\)? To determine that, I should think about the behavior of \\( f(x) \\).\n\nLet's find the derivative of \\( f(x) \\) to understand its monotonicity.\n\n\\( f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(e^x + x - 2) = e^x + 1 \\)\n\nSince \\( e^x > 0 \\) for all \\( x \\), and \\( e^x + 1 > 0 \\), \\( f'(x) \\) is always positive. That means \\( f(x) \\) is strictly increasing.\n\nTherefore, since \\( f(x) \\) is strictly increasing, there can be at most one solution in any interval.\n\nGiven that we already found that there is at least one solution in \\([0, 1]\\), and now we know there is at most one, we can conclude that there is exactly one solution in \\([0, 1]\\). So, \\( k = 1 \\).\n\nNow, for the number of real solutions not in \\([0, 1]\\), which is \\( n \\).\n\nFirst, let's consider \\( x < 0 \\).\n\nAs \\( x \\) approaches negative infinity, \\( e^x \\) approaches 0, so \\( f(x) \\) approaches \\( 0 + x - 2 = x - 2 \\). Since \\( x \\) is negative, \\( f(x) \\) becomes more and more negative as \\( x \\) decreases.\n\nAt \\( x = 0 \\), \\( f(0) = -1 \\).\n\nWe already know that at \\( x = 1 \\), \\( f(1) \\approx 1.718 \\), which is positive.\n\nSince \\( f(x) \\) is continuous and strictly increasing, and it goes from negative to positive as \\( x \\) increases, there is only one point where \\( f(x) = 0 \\), which we've already established is in \\([0, 1]\\).\n\nTherefore, there are no solutions outside of \\([0, 1]\\), meaning \\( n = 0 \\).\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check.\n\nIs there any possibility of another solution outside \\([0, 1]\\)?\n\nLet's consider \\( x > 1 \\).\n\nAs \\( x \\) increases beyond 1, \\( e^x \\) grows exponentially, so \\( f(x) = e^x + x - 2 \\) becomes larger and larger. For example:\n\nAt \\( x = 2 \\), \\( f(2) = e^2 + 2 - 2 = e^2 \\approx 7.389 \\), which is positive.\n\nAt \\( x = 3 \\), \\( f(3) = e^3 + 3 - 2 = e^3 + 1 \\approx 20.085 + 1 = 21.085 \\), still positive.\n\nSo, since \\( f(x) \\) is strictly increasing and already positive at \\( x = 1 \\), it will remain positive for all \\( x > 1 \\). Therefore, there are no solutions for \\( x > 1 \\).\n\nNow, for \\( x < 0 \\), as \\( x \\) approaches negative infinity, \\( f(x) \\) approaches negative infinity, and at \\( x = 0 \\), \\( f(0) = -1 \\).\n\nBut since \\( f(x) \\) is strictly increasing and crosses zero only once in \\([0, 1]\\), there are no solutions for \\( x < 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the only solution is in \\([0, 1]\\), meaning \\( k = 1 \\) and \\( n = 0 \\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. k = 0 and n = 1\n\nB. k = 1 and n = 0\n\nC. k = n = 1\n\nD. k > 1\n\nThe correct choice is B. k = 1 and n = 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
