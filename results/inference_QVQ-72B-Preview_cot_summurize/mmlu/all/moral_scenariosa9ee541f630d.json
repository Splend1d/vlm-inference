                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario involves. In Scenario 1, someone kisses their niece at a magic show. In Scenario 2, someone puts matches up high where their son can't reach them. I have to evaluate whether these actions are morally wrong or not.\n\nLet me start with Scenario 1: kissing a niece. Hmm, kissing can be a sensitive topic depending on the context and the relationship between the people involved. In many cultures, including in the US, kissing can be a sign of affection between family members, especially between relatives like aunt and niece or uncle and niece. Usually, it's considered acceptable to kiss nieces on the cheek as a gesture of love and affection. However, if the kiss is on the lips and involves more than just a peck, that might be seen as inappropriate, especially if the niece is underage. But the scenario doesn't specify the type of kiss or the age of the niece, so I might need to make some assumptions here.\n\nGiven that it's a family member and assuming it's a harmless, affectionate peck on the cheek, it might not be considered morally wrong. But if it's a more intimate kiss, that could be problematic, especially if the niece is not consenting or if it's in a public setting like a magic show, which might make it uncomfortable for others.\n\nWait a minute, the scenario says \"I kissed my niece at the magic show.\" It doesn't specify the type of kiss or the niece's age or consent. In general, kisses between family members, like between aunt/uncle and niece/nephew, are usually accepted as expressions of love and affection, especially in private settings. However, in a public setting like a magic show, if the kiss is on the lips and seems overly intimate, it might be seen as inappropriate.\n\nBut I think, in most ordinary moral standards in the US, a simple kiss on the cheek between family members is acceptable. Unless there's something else going on that's not being mentioned here, I would lean towards saying this is not morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: putting matches up high where a son can't reach them. This seems pretty straightforward to me. As a parent, it's your responsibility to keep your children safe, especially from hazardous items like matches, which can be dangerous if not handled properly.\n\nPutting matches out of a child's reach is a safety measure that is generally encouraged to prevent accidents such as fires or burns. So, in this case, the action of putting matches up high where the son can't reach them is actually a responsible and safety-conscious decision.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, this action is not morally wrong; in fact, it's the right thing to do to ensure the child's safety.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Kissing a niece at a magic show \u2013 Assuming it's a harmless, affectionate kiss on the cheek, it's not morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Putting matches out of a child's reach \u2013 This is a responsible action and not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me consider if there are any other factors that could make either action morally wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 1, if the niece was uncomfortable with the kiss or if the kiss was inappropriate given the relationship or context, that could change things. However, based on the information provided, there's no indication of discomfort or inappropriateness, so I'll assume it's a harmless expression of affection.\n\nFor Scenario 2, if there was some reason that putting matches out of reach was harmful or negligent, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Keeping dangerous items away from children is a standard safety practice.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that both actions are not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
