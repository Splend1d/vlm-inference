                    "text": "So I've got this question here about how a higher level of education affects voting habits. It's asking which of the options isn't true regarding this impact. The options are:\n\nA. Voters are more likely to support government-enforced affirmative action programs\n\nB. Voters are more likely to support environmental protection efforts\n\nC. Voters are more likely to support public prayer in schools\n\nD. Voters are less likely to support restrictions on abortion rights\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Generally, higher education is associated with more liberal or progressive political views, at least in many Western countries. So, with that in mind, I need to see which of these options doesn't align with that tendency.\n\nFirst, option A: support for government-enforced affirmative action programs. Affirmative action is a policy designed to address inequalities in areas like education and employment. People with higher education might be more aware of social inequalities and therefore more supportive of such policies. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption B: support for environmental protection efforts. Again, higher education often correlates with greater awareness of environmental issues and a higher likelihood of supporting policies that protect the environment. So, this also seems in line with the idea that more educated voters are more liberal or progressive.\n\nOption C: support for public prayer in schools. This one feels different. Public prayer in schools is a touchy subject, involving the separation of church and state. Higher education typically promotes critical thinking and separation of religion from state affairs. So, maybe this isn't something that more educated voters would support.\n\nOption D: less likely to support restrictions on abortion rights. This aligns with more liberal views on personal choice and reproductive rights. So, again, this seems consistent with the idea that higher education leads to more liberal voting habits.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems out of place. Supporting public prayer in schools doesn't typically align with the more liberal or progressive views that higher education seems to foster.\n\nBut, just to make sure, let me think about some research or studies that might back this up. I recall that there's evidence suggesting that higher levels of education are correlated with increased support for social justice issues, like affirmative action and environmental protection. Similarly, higher education is often linked to more permissive views on abortion.\n\nOn the other hand, when it comes to public prayer in schools, higher education might lead to a greater appreciation for the separation of church and state, which would likely result in less support for such measures.\n\nTherefore, the exception here would be option C: voters are more likely to support public prayer in schools. Because, actually, higher education might make people less likely to support that.\n\nSo, my answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
