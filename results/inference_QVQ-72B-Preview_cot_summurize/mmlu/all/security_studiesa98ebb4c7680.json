                    "text": "So I've come across this question about the Washington Consensus, and I need to identify which of the options isn't one of its 10 steps. The options are:\n\nA. Fiscal Discipline: budget deficits of no more than 2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nB. Tax Reform: broadening the tax base, cut marginal tax rates, improve tax administration.\n\nC. Property Rights: legal reforms to secure property rights without excessive costs and to regularize the informal sector.\n\nD. Nationalization: state enterprises should be protected.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Washington Consensus is. I remember that it's a set of economic policy prescriptions that were popular in the 1980s and 1990s, particularly for countries in Latin America experiencing economic crises. These policies were largely advocated by international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, both headquartered in Washington, D.C., hence the name \"Washington Consensus.\"\n\nThe original Washington Consensus included 10 key points, which generally promoted free-market policies, fiscal responsibility, and structural reforms to enhance economic efficiency and growth. Let me list them out to get a better sense:\n\n1. Fiscal Discipline: Reduce budget deficits to prevent inflation.\n\n2. Tax Reform: Broaden the tax base, reduce marginal tax rates, and improve tax collection.\n\n3. Property Rights: Establish secure property rights and regularization of the informal sector.\n\n4. Deregulation: Remove excessive regulations that hinder market entry and competition.\n\n5. Trade Liberalization: Eliminate barriers to imports and exports.\n\n6. Exchange Rate Stability: Adopt a realistic exchange rate to promote trade.\n\n7. Interest Rate Liberalization: Allow market-determined interest rates.\n\n8. Capital Mobility: Encourage foreign direct investment.\n\n9. Privatization: Sell state-owned enterprises to the private sector.\n\n10. Deregulation of Internal Markets: Remove barriers to domestic competition.\n\nLooking at these, I can see that options A, B, and C correspond directly to points 1, 2, and 3, respectively. So, those are clearly part of the Washington Consensus.\n\nOption D says \"Nationalization: state enterprises should be protected.\" Hmm, that sounds contrary to what I recall about the Washington Consensus. I remember that one of the key points was privatization, which involves selling state-owned enterprises to private investors. This was seen as a way to improve efficiency and reduce the burden on public finances.\n\nSo, if privatization is a core component of the Washington Consensus, then nationalization, which is the opposite\u2014meaning increasing government ownership and control over industries\u2014would not be part of it. In fact, protecting state enterprises would run counter to the privatization goal.\n\nTo double-check, I can look back at the list I wrote down. Privatization is definitely included, and there's nothing about nationalization in the original 10 points.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Nationalization: state enterprises should be protected.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll quickly review each option again:\n\nA. Fiscal Discipline: This is definitely a part, aiming to control budget deficits.\n\nB. Tax Reform: Broadening the tax base and improving administration are key aspects.\n\nC. Property Rights: Securing property rights is essential for market economies.\n\nD. Nationalization: This contradicts the privatization policy, so it's not part of the Washington Consensus.\n\nYes, I'm confident that D is not one of the 10 steps of the Washington Consensus.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
