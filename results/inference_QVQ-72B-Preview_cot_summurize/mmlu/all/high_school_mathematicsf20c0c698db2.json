                    "text": "Let's see. I have this equation to solve for x: \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{25}\\right)^{x + 2} = 125^{-x}\\). Hmm, fractions and negative exponents can be tricky, but I think I can handle it if I break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that \\(\\frac{1}{25}\\) is the same as \\(25^{-1}\\), right? So, I can rewrite the left side of the equation using this property. That gives me:\n\n\\[\n(25^{-1})^{x + 2} = 125^{-x}\n\\]\n\nNow, I remember that when you have an exponent raised to another exponent, you multiply them. So, \\((a^{m})^{n} = a^{m \\cdot n}\\). Applying that here:\n\n\\[\n25^{-1 \\cdot (x + 2)} = 125^{-x}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the exponent on the left:\n\n\\[\n25^{-x - 2} = 125^{-x}\n\\]\n\nOkay, now I notice that both 25 and 125 are powers of 5. Specifically, \\(25 = 5^{2}\\) and \\(125 = 5^{3}\\). Maybe I can rewrite the entire equation in terms of the base 5. That could make it easier to solve.\n\nSo, substituting \\(25 = 5^{2}\\) and \\(125 = 5^{3}\\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\n(5^{2})^{-x - 2} = (5^{3})^{-x}\n\\]\n\nAgain, using the property of exponents that \\((a^{m})^{n} = a^{m \\cdot n}\\), I can simplify both sides:\n\n\\[\n5^{2 \\cdot (-x - 2)} = 5^{3 \\cdot (-x)}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the exponents:\n\n\\[\n5^{-2x - 4} = 5^{-3x}\n\\]\n\nNow, since both sides of the equation have the same base, I can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n\\[\n-2x - 4 = -3x\n\\]\n\nAlright, now I have a simple linear equation to solve for x. Let's add \\(3x\\) to both sides to get all the x terms on one side:\n\n\\[\n-2x + 3x - 4 = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nx - 4 = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(x = 4\\).\n\nLet me just double-check that this is correct. Plugging x back into the original equation:\n\nLeft side: \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{25}\\right)^{4 + 2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{25}\\right)^{6} = 25^{-6}\\)\n\nRight side: \\(125^{-4} = (5^{3})^{-4} = 5^{-12}\\)\n\nWait a minute, \\(25^{-6}\\) is \\((5^{2})^{-6} = 5^{-12}\\), which matches the right side. So, yes, x = 4 is the correct solution.\n\nI think that's it. It seems straightforward once I broke it down like that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
