                    "text": "So I have this problem here: 1,224 divided by 9. I need to find the quotient, and the options are A. 135, B. 136, C. 1,215, and D. 1,360. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, division is just repeated subtraction, right? So, if I have 1,224 and I keep subtracting 9 until I reach zero, the number of times I subtracted would be the quotient. But that sounds time-consuming. There has to be a better way.\n\nI remember learning long division in school. Maybe I can use that method. Let's recall how long division works. I need to divide 1,224 by 9.\n\nStarting with the first digit, 1, but 9 is larger than 1, so I can't divide it. So, I'll take the first two digits: 12. Now, how many times does 9 go into 12? Well, 9 times 1 is 9, which is less than 12. 9 times 2 is 18, which is too big. So, 1 times.\n\nI write down 1 as the first digit of the quotient. Then, I subtract 9 from 12, which gives me 3. Now, I bring down the next digit, which is 2, making it 32. How many times does 9 go into 32? 9 times 3 is 27, and 9 times 4 is 36. So, 3 times, write down 3 next to the 1 in the quotient. Subtract 27 from 32, which is 5. Bring down the next digit, 4, making it 54.\n\nNow, how many times does 9 go into 54? Well, 9 times 6 is 54, exactly. So, I write down 6 next to the 13 in the quotient. Subtract 54 from 54, and I get 0. So, the quotient is 136.\n\nWait a minute, let me check if 9 times 136 is indeed 1,224. Because if it is, that confirms my answer.\n\n9 times 100 is 900.\n\n9 times 30 is 270.\n\n9 times 6 is 54.\n\nAdding them up: 900 + 270 = 1,170 + 54 = 1,224.\n\nYes, that checks out. So, the correct answer should be B. 136.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to solve this. Maybe using multiplication inverses or something, but that might be overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, I could use estimation. 9 times 100 is 900, which is less than 1,224. 9 times 200 is 1,800, which is more than 1,224. So, the answer should be between 100 and 200. That narrows it down to options A and B.\n\nBetween 135 and 136, let's see what 9 times 135 is. 9 times 15 is 135, and 9 times 10 is 90. So, 9 times 135 would be 90 + 135, which is 225, wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no: 9 times 100 is 900, and 9 times 30 is 270, and 9 times 5 is 45. Adding them up: 900 + 270 = 1,170 + 45 = 1,215. So, 9 times 135 is 1,215, which is less than 1,224.\n\nTherefore, 9 times 136 must be 1,224, as I checked earlier. So, that confirms that 136 is the correct quotient.\n\nI should also consider if there's any remainder. Since 9 times 136 is exactly 1,224, there's no remainder. So, the answer is indeed 136.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think about the properties of division. The divisor is 9, the dividend is 1,224, and the quotient is what we're solving for. In division, dividend equals divisor times quotient plus remainder. So, 1,224 = 9 * quotient + remainder.\n\nWe've found that quotient is 136, and remainder is 0. Plugging in: 1,224 = 9 * 136 + 0, which checks out because 9 times 136 is 1,224.\n\nI think that's pretty solid. So, the final answer is B. 136.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 136} \\]"
