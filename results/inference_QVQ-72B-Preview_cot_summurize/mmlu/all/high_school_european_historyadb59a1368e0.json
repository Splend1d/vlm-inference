                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Roland Dorgel\u00e8s' recollection of the first day of mobilization in France in 1914. The passage is from his work \"After 50 Years,\" written around 1965, and it describes his reaction to the announcement of mobilization on August 2, 1914. Let me try to understand what he's saying and see which option makes the most sense.\n\nFirst, he hears someone shouting that something is posted at the district mayor's office, and he runs to Rue Drout immediately. He reads the message quickly: \"The First Day of Mobilization Will Be Sunday, August 2 [1914].\" He mentions that this was an announcement to a million and a half Frenchmen. Then, despite being dead tired, he feels exhilarated and goes back to his newspaper's office, bursting into Georges Clemenceau's office. Clemenceau asks him what Paris is saying, and Dorgel\u00e8s replies that it's singing. Clemenceau responds, \"It will be all right then.\"\n\nOkay, so the key points are:\n\n- He runs to read the announcement immediately, showing urgency and importance.\n\n- He feels exhilarated despite being tired, suggesting excitement or enthusiasm.\n\n- He describes Paris as \"singing,\" which implies a joyful or celebratory atmosphere.\n\n- Clemenceau's response suggests that he approves or is relieved by the public's reaction.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Mobilization for war in 1914 was greeted with great skepticism in Paris.\n\nBut the passage doesn't indicate skepticism. Quite the opposite, it suggests enthusiasm and celebration.\n\nB. Mobilization for war in 1914 was greeted with great skepticism all across Europe.\n\nThis is too broad, as the passage only talks about Paris, not all of Europe. And again, the tone isn't skeptical.\n\nC. Mobilization for war in 1914 was greeted with great enthusiasm all across Europe.\n\nAgain, the passage only refers to Paris, not the whole of Europe. While it might be true, the passage doesn't provide enough information to make that claim.\n\nD. Mobilization for war in 1914 was greeted with great enthusiasm in Paris.\n\nThis seems to align with the description. He feels exhilarated, Paris is \"singing,\" which suggests celebration and enthusiasm.\n\nSo, based on the information provided in the passage, option D seems to be the most accurate inference.\n\nWait a minute, but I know from history that the outbreak of World War I was met with a mix of reactions in different places. In some countries, there was enthusiasm for war, seeing it as a patriotic duty or a way to resolve tensions. But in other places, there was fear and apprehension.\n\nHowever, the question specifies that this is about Dorgel\u00e8s' recollection, so it's focused on his personal experience and what he observed in Paris at that time.\n\nAlso, the passage mentions \"a million and a half Frenchmen,\" which suggests that the mobilization affected a significant portion of the population, likely the military reservists who were being called up.\n\nGiven that, and the fact that he describes Paris as \"singing,\" it's reasonable to conclude that the reaction in Paris was one of enthusiasm and support for the mobilization.\n\nI don't think the passage supports the idea of skepticism or doubt; rather, it conveys a sense of energy and perhaps national pride.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D: mobilization for war in 1914 was greeted with great enthusiasm in Paris.\n\nJust to make sure, let's look back at the question: \"From the passage, one may infer that Dorgel\u00e8s recalled that...\"\n\nThe other options either overreach by claiming knowledge about all of Europe or suggest a skeptical reaction that isn't supported by the passage.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that D is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
