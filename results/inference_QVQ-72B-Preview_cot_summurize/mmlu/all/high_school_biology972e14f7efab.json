                    "text": "So I have this question here about the difference between cartilage and bone. It's asking which of the given options is the major difference between them. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I know that both cartilage and bone are part of the skeletal system. Cartilage is like a connective tissue that's found in different parts of the body, like the ears, nose, and between the bones in joints. Bone is harder and forms the main structure of our skeleton.\n\nOption A says that cartilage is a part of the skeletal system. Well, both cartilage and bone are parts of the skeletal system, so that can't be the difference.\n\nOption B says that cartilage is composed of collagen and salts. I think bone is also composed of collagen and minerals like calcium salts. So, again, that seems similar for both.\n\nOption C says that cartilage lacks blood vessels and nerves. Now, I recall that cartilage is indeed avascular, meaning it doesn't have its own blood supply, unlike bone, which does have blood vessels. Nerves might be present in some cartilage, but I think bone has nerves too. So, maybe this is a key difference.\n\nOption D says that cartilage secretes a matrix. Both cartilage and bone have extracellular matrices that they secrete. In cartilage, it's mostly collagen and proteoglycans, while in bone, it's collagen and mineral salts. So, both do secrete a matrix, but the composition differs.\n\nGiven these points, it seems like option C is the most accurate statement of the major difference between cartilage and bone. Cartilage lacks blood vessels and nerves, whereas bone has both.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that. Does cartilage have nerves? I think in some cases, yes, especially in areas like the knee joint, where there might be nerve endings. But compared to bone, which has a rich nerve supply, cartilage has fewer nerves.\n\nAlso, regarding blood supply, it's definitely true that cartilage is avascular, meaning it doesn't have its own blood vessels. Bone, on the other hand, has a well-developed vascular system to supply nutrients and oxygen to the bone cells.\n\nSo, even if cartilage does have some nerves, especially in certain regions, it's generally less innervated than bone. But the main difference is indeed the lack of blood vessels in cartilage.\n\nMaybe I should consider if there are other significant differences that could be considered the major one.\n\nLet me think about their structure. Bone is denser and harder than cartilage, which is more flexible and elastic. But that's more about their physical properties.\n\nFunctionally, bone provides support and protection, and is involved in blood cell production. Cartilage primarily provides cushioning and support in joints, and is also found in the respiratory tract and other parts.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the major difference between them, and among the given options, C seems to be the most fitting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the composition of their matrix could be considered a major difference, but option D is phrased as \"secretes a matrix,\" which is true for both, just different matrices.\n\nI think the best answer is C: lacks blood vessels and nerves. Even if cartilage does have some nerves in certain areas, it's primarily avascular, whereas bone has a robust blood supply.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me confirm this information.\n\nUpon checking, cartilage is indeed avascular; it relies on diffusion from nearby blood vessels for its nutrition. Nerves may be present in some cartilage tissues, especially in areas subject to mechanical stress, but it's not as heavily innervated as bone.\n\nBone, in contrast, has a rich blood supply via blood vessels that enter through the periosteum and canal systems within the bone. Nerves are also present in bone, contributing to sensation and pain.\n\nTherefore, while both tissues have some nerves, the absence of blood vessels in cartilage is a significant difference compared to bone.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C: lacks blood vessels and nerves.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
