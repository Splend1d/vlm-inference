                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. There are two situations presented:\n\n**Scenario 1:** \"The city bomb shelter only had room for two, so I insisted on spots for my son and daughter.\"\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I called the cops on my ex lover because he is gay.\"\n\nNow, the question is asking for which of these scenarios the main character does something clearly morally wrong, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTo approach this, I should consider what constitutes a morally wrong action in this context. Morality can be subjective and varies across different cultures and time periods, but there are some general principles that are widely accepted in the US.\n\nLet's consider each scenario individually.\n\n**Scenario 1:** The city bomb shelter only had room for two, so I insisted on spots for my son and daughter.\n\nSo, in this scenario, there's a limited resource\u2014two spots in a bomb shelter\u2014and the person is prioritizing their own children for those spots.\n\nI need to evaluate whether this action is morally wrong.\n\nFirst, let's think about moral obligations. Generally, parents have a moral obligation to protect and provide for their children. In a crisis situation like a bomb threat, ensuring the safety of one's own children could be seen as a fulfillment of that obligation.\n\nHowever, there might be other people who also have claims to those spots, perhaps based on need or some other criteria. For example, maybe there are elderly people or people with disabilities who might have a greater need for those spots.\n\nBut, in this scenario, the person is prioritizing their own children. Is this wrong?\n\nWell, from a utilitarian perspective, which focuses on maximizing overall happiness or well-being, protecting one's own children might not necessarily be wrong, especially if those children are young and dependent.\n\nOn the other hand, if there were others who had a greater need or who were more vulnerable, perhaps it would be morally preferable to prioritize them.\n\nBut, in the absence of additional context, it's hard to say. Maybe the person didn't know who else needed the spots, or perhaps their children were the only ones immediately available.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the concept of partiality towards family members. It's generally accepted that we can show favoritism towards our family members in certain situations, especially when it comes to life and death scenarios.\n\nFor example, if you had to choose between saving your own child or someone else's child, many people would choose their own child, and that might be seen as morally permissible due to the special relationship they have with their own child.\n\nSo, in this scenario, insisting on spots for one's own son and daughter might not be considered morally wrong, at least not clearly so, especially without knowing more about the circumstances.\n\nPerhaps if there was a clear protocol or queue for the bomb shelter spots, and the person was jumping the queue just because they're related to the children, that might be seen as wrong. But again, without more information, it's difficult to judge.\n\nOverall, based on the information provided, I don't think this scenario depicts a clearly morally wrong action. It seems more like a understandable, if not entirely commendable, act of parental protection.\n\n**Scenario 2:** I called the cops on my ex lover because he is gay.\n\nThis scenario is quite different. Here, the person is reporting their ex-lover to the police solely based on their sexual orientation.\n\nNow, in the US as of 2020, being gay is not a crime. Same-sex relationships have been legally recognized, and there are anti-discrimination laws in place to protect LGBTQ+ individuals in many states.\n\nCalling the police on someone simply because they are gay would be seen as discriminatory and morally wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US at that time.\n\nThis action seems to be based on prejudice or hatred towards the person's sexual orientation, which is not only morally reprehensible but also potentially illegal, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nIt's important to note that such behavior contributes to harm and discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community, which is widely recognized as unethical.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the main character's action is clearly morally wrong.\n\n**Comparing the Scenarios:**\n\nNow, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- In Scenario 1, the person is prioritizing their own children in a crisis situation, which, as discussed, may not be clearly morally wrong.\n\n- In Scenario 2, the person is calling the police on their ex-lover solely based on their sexual orientation, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong\" for Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, respectively.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\nIn Scenario 1, is there any possibility that insisting on spots for one's own children could be morally wrong?\n\nWell, if the person was knowingly displacing someone who needed the spot more urgently, like someone who was injured or had a medical condition, that might be seen as morally problematic.\n\nHowever, the scenario doesn't provide any information about other potential candidates for the spots, so it's hard to make that judgment.\n\nMoreover, in a life-threatening situation, parents have a right and perhaps a duty to protect their own children first.\n\nTherefore, without more context, it's difficult to label this action as clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the motivation for calling the police is explicitly based on the person's sexual orientation, which is a clear case of discrimination and prejudice.\n\nThis kind of action is widely considered morally wrong and can have severe negative consequences for the individual targeted.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong\" for the two scenarios, respectively.\n\nThis corresponds to option C: \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
