                    "text": "So I have this question about discrete probability distributions, and I need to figure out which statement is true for any discrete probability distribution of a random variable X. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that the expected value of X is equal to np. Hmm, I remember that in a binomial distribution, where you have n independent trials each with success probability p, the expected value is indeed np. But is this always true for any discrete probability distribution? I don't think so. For example, in a uniform distribution or a Poisson distribution, the expected value isn't np. So, probably not.\n\nOption B says that the sum of all possible values of X is equal to one. Wait a minute, that doesn't sound right. In probability, the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes should be one, but the sum of the actual values of X... let's think about it. For example, if X is a fair six-sided die, the possible values are 1 through 6, and their sum is 21, which is definitely not one. So, this can't be true for any discrete probability distribution.\n\nOption C says that the probabilities of all possible values of X must add up to one. That sounds familiar. I think this is a fundamental property of probability distributions. Whether it's discrete or continuous, the total probability has to be one. In discrete terms, if you sum up the probabilities of all possible values that X can take, it should equal one. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nOption D says that the probability distribution is bell-shaped and symmetric. Bell-shaped and symmetric typically describe a normal distribution, which is continuous, not discrete. Discrete probability distributions can take many forms; some can be symmetric, like the binomial distribution under certain parameters, but many are not. For example, the Poisson distribution can be skewed, especially with low mean values. So, this isn't true for all discrete probability distributions.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, it seems like Option C is the correct answer. The probabilities of all possible values of X must add up to one. That's a general property of any probability distribution, discrete or not.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. In discrete probability, the probability mass function (pmf) of X, denoted as P(X = x), must satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. For every possible value x, P(X = x) \u2265 0.\n\n2. The sum over all possible values x of P(X = x) = 1.\n\nSo, yes, the sum of all probabilities is indeed one. That's a defining characteristic of probability distributions.\n\nOption A is specific to binomial distributions, option B is incorrect because it's the sum of the values, not their probabilities, and option D refers to the shape of the distribution, which isn't uniformly applicable to all discrete distributions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
