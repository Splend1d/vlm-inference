                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 16-year-old boy who's come to the emergency department with sudden swelling in his right knee. He says there was no trauma, which is interesting. His past medical history includes cystic fibrosis. On examination, the knee feels fluctuant on palpation, but there's no increased warmth, and he has some mild restriction in movement because of the swelling. Also, the doctor noticed numerous bruises in different stages of healing, and the boy mentioned that he's been bruising easily and having some bleeding from his gums over the past month.\n\nAlright, so first things first, I need to understand what's going on here. The key points are:\n\n- Sudden-onset swelling of the right knee without trauma.\n\n- Past medical history of cystic fibrosis.\n\n- Fluctuant knee joint without increased warmth.\n\n- Mild restriction in range of motion.\n\n- Numerous bruises in various stages of resolution.\n\n- Easy bruising and bleeding from gums over the past month.\n\nOkay, so let's think about cystic fibrosis (CF) first. CF is a genetic disorder that affects the production of mucus, sweat, and digestive enzymes. It's caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. People with CF often have lung problems, pancreatic insufficiency, and other complications.\n\nNow, the boy has sudden knee swelling without trauma, which is unusual. The fact that there's no warmth suggests that it might not be an inflammatory process, but it could still be something like a hemarthrosis, which is blood in the joint. Hemarthrosis can be caused by bleeding disorders or trauma, but he denies trauma.\n\nThe presence of numerous bruises in various stages and easy bruising suggests that there might be a problem with his blood clotting mechanism. Additionally, the bleeding from the gums further supports this idea.\n\nSo, why would someone with cystic fibrosis have a bleeding disorder?\n\nWell, CF can lead to malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins because of pancreatic insufficiency. The fat-soluble vitamins are A, D, E, and K. Vitamin K is particularly important because it's necessary for the production of certain clotting factors in the liver, like factors II, VII, IX, and X.\n\nIf someone with CF isn't absorbing vitamin K properly, they might develop a vitamin K deficiency, which can lead to impaired blood clotting and, consequently, easy bruising and bleeding.\n\nBut wait, the options include other possibilities. Let's consider each one:\n\nA. Acquired factor VIII deficiency.\n\nFactor VIII is important in the coagulation cascade, and a deficiency can lead to hemophilia A, which is typically an inherited condition, but acquired deficiencies can occur. However, it's less common, and I don't have a direct link to CF here.\n\nB. Diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC) secondary to infection.\n\nDIC is a serious condition where blood clots form throughout the bloodstream, leading to bleeding problems. It can be triggered by various factors, including infections. People with CF are prone to lung infections, so there is a possibility of DIC due to an infection. However, the presentation here doesn't seem acute; it's been going on for a month with easy bruising and bleeding.\n\nC. Hypocomplementemia.\n\nComplement is a group of proteins in the blood that help the immune system fight infections. Hypocomplementemia means low levels of these proteins, which can be seen in various conditions, including autoimmune diseases and infections. While CF can be associated with some immune system abnormalities, I'm not sure if hypocomplementemia is a direct complication of CF.\n\nD. Malabsorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K.\n\nThis seems directly relevant to CF, as malabsorption is a common issue due to pancreatic insufficiency. Vitamin K deficiency, as I thought earlier, could lead to the bleeding symptoms he's experiencing.\n\nSo, let's think this through again.\n\nThe boy has CF, which causes malabsorption. That means he might not be absorbing vitamin K well, leading to vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting, so a deficiency could cause easy bruising and bleeding, including hemarthrosis in the knee.\n\nThe fact that the knee swelling is sudden and without trauma suggests a possible hemarthrosis due to the bleeding disorder.\n\nAdditionally, the bruises in various stages indicate that the bleeding issues have been going on for some time, which aligns with his report of easy bruising and gum bleeding over the past month.\n\nNow, let's consider if there could be another explanation.\n\nOption A, acquired factor VIII deficiency, is possible, but it's not directly linked to CF, and I don't have any other indications to suggest that.\n\nOption B, DIC secondary to infection, is a possibility given that CF patients are prone to infections, but DIC is usually a more acute process, and the symptoms here seem to have been present for a month.\n\nOption C, hypocomplementemia, doesn't seem directly related to the presenting symptoms of knee swelling and bruising.\n\nTherefore, option D, malabsorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K, seems the most plausible explanation for his symptoms.\n\nMoreover, treating vitamin K deficiency with vitamin K supplements should help improve his clotting issues, which would be a straightforward intervention.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the most likely explanation for these findings is malabsorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K, particularly leading to vitamin K deficiency and impaired blood clotting.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
