                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"What color is Uncle Sam's goatee?\" And the options are A. brown, B. black, C. white, D. dishwater blond. Hmm, interesting. I need to figure this out, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, who is Uncle Sam? Uncle Sam is a fictional character who represents the United States government. He's been around for a long time, and he's usually depicted as a tall, thin man wearing a top hat, a suit with stars and stripes, and he has a beard\u2014specifically, a goatee. But what color is that goatee?\n\nLet me recall some images of Uncle Sam. I think he often has a white beard, but I might be mistaken. Wait, maybe it's gray? No, I don't think so. Let me consider the options again: brown, black, white, or dishwater blond.\n\nDishwater blond sounds a bit unusual for a goatee color. I'm not even sure what dishwater blond looks like. Is that a real hair color? It sounds like it might be a humorous or misleading option, so maybe I should eliminate that one.\n\nNow, between brown, black, and white, which one is more likely? I know that in many representations, Uncle Sam has white hair and a white beard, especially in older illustrations. But I'm not entirely sure if that's consistent across all depictions.\n\nLet me think about some famous images of Uncle Sam. There's the \"I Want You\" poster from World War I, which shows Uncle Sam pointing his finger. In that image, his hair and beard look white. But I might be wrong about that. Maybe they're light gray or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Uncle Sam has been depicted with different beard colors over the years. That could be possible, as artistic interpretations can vary.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can look up some images of Uncle Sam to get a better idea. But since I can't do that right now, I'll have to rely on my memory and reasoning.\n\nConsidering that Uncle Sam is often portrayed as an older man, it's plausible that his beard would be white or gray, which are common colors for elderly people. Black and brown are more typical of younger adults.\n\nBut, on the other hand, maybe the artist wanted to give him a more distinguished look with a white beard. That seems likely.\n\nLet me consider the context. Uncle Sam is a symbol of America, and white is often associated with purity and goodness, which might be attributes the artists wanted to emphasize.\n\nHowever, I also recall that in some more modern depictions, Uncle Sam might have a different beard color. Maybe sometimes he's shown with a brown beard?\n\nI'm starting to get a bit confused here. Maybe I should think about the original creation of Uncle Sam. He was first popularized in the early 19th century, and his appearance has evolved over time. Perhaps in the earliest illustrations, his beard was a different color.\n\nIf I had to make an educated guess based on my knowledge, I would say that Uncle Sam's goatee is most commonly depicted as white. That seems to align with the traditional image of him as an older, wise figure.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider whether there are official guidelines for how Uncle Sam should be depicted. Maybe there's a standard color scheme that artists are supposed to follow.\n\nI don't know if such guidelines exist, but it's possible. Without that information, though, I'll have to rely on common representations.\n\nAnother thought: in the \"I Want You\" poster, which is perhaps the most famous depiction of Uncle Sam, his hair and beard appear to be white. That seems to be a strong indicator of his typical beard color.\n\nAdditionally, in various cartoons and animations, Uncle Sam is often shown with a white beard. For example, in some Looney Tunes episodes, he appears with white hair and a white goatee.\n\nGiven that, it seems that white is the most consistent color for Uncle Sam's goatee across different media and time periods.\n\nSo, after considering all these points, I think the answer is C. white.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. white}} \\]"
