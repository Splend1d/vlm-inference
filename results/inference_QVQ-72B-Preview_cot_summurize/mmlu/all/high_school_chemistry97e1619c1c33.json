                    "text": "So I have this question here about net ionic equations. It says, \"Which pair of reactants will have no net ionic equation (that is, all the ions cancel)?\u201d And the options are:\n\nA. Na2SO3 + FeCl2\n\nB. CaCl2 + MnSO4\n\nC. NH4I + Pb(NO3)2\n\nD. KOH + HClO4\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what a net ionic equation is. From what I remember in chemistry class, a net ionic equation shows only the ions that are directly involved in the reaction. Spectator ions, which don't change during the reaction, are left out.\n\nSo, if all the ions are spectator ions and nothing really reacts, then there would be no net ionic equation. That means no reaction occurs between the ions from the two reactants.\n\nI think the question is asking for the pair of reactants where, when they are mixed, no precipitation or other ionic reaction occurs. In other words, all the possible combinations of ions from the two reactants are soluble and remain in solution.\n\nLet me recall the solubility rules to figure this out.\n\nSolubility rules:\n\n1. All nitrates (NO3-) are soluble.\n\n2. All salts of alkali metals (like Na+, K+) are soluble.\n\n3. Most chlorides are soluble except those of Ag+, Pb2+, and Hg2+.\n\n4. Most sulfates are soluble except BaSO4, CaSO4, PbSO4, Ag2SO4, Hg2SO4.\n\n5. Most hydroxides are insoluble except those of alkali metals and Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+.\n\n6. All halides (Cl-, Br-, I-) are soluble except Ag+, Pb2+, and Hg2+.\n\nOkay, so with these in mind, let's look at each pair.\n\nOption A: Na2SO3 + FeCl2\n\nFirst, let's see what could precipitate. Na2SO3 is sodium sulfite, and FeCl2 is ferrous chloride. Possible products are FeSO3 (iron(II) sulfite) and NaCl.\n\nWait, is iron(II) sulfite soluble? I don't have it memorized, but since most sulfites are soluble except for those I listed earlier. Let me check.\n\nI know that most sulfites are soluble, but some are not. Specifically, BaSO3 and PbSO3 are insoluble. What about FeSO3?\n\nHmm, I think FeSO3 is soluble. But to be safe, I should confirm.\n\nLooking back, I see that most sulfites are soluble, except for BaSO3, PbSO3, etc. Iron(II) sulfite isn't listed as insoluble, so I'll assume it's soluble.\n\nSo, if both FeSO3 and NaCl are soluble, then there's no precipitation, and all ions remain in solution. Therefore, no net ionic equation.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a reaction between Fe2+ and SO32- to form something else? I don't think so; they should just stay as ions.\n\nSo, option A might be a possibility.\n\nOption B: CaCl2 + MnSO4\n\nCalcium chloride and manganese(II) sulfate. Possible products are CaSO4 (calcium sulfate) and MnCl2 (manganese(II) chloride).\n\nIs calcium sulfate soluble? I recall that calcium sulfate is slightly soluble, but generally, it's considered insoluble or sparingly soluble.\n\nWait, maybe I need to double-check that. Solubility rules say most sulfates are soluble except BaSO4, CaSO4, PbSO4, etc.\n\nSo, CaSO4 is slightly soluble, but it does precipitate to some extent.\n\nTherefore, in this reaction, some CaSO4 would precipitate out, and MnCl2 would stay in solution.\n\nSince there's a precipitate forming, there is a net ionic equation: Ca2+ + SO4^2- \u2192 CaSO4(s)\n\nSo, option B is not the correct choice because there is a precipitation reaction occurring.\n\nOption C: NH4I + Pb(NO3)2\n\nAmmonium iodide and lead(II) nitrate. Possible products are NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate) and PbI2 (lead(II) iodide).\n\nIs PbI2 soluble? I know that most iodides are soluble except for Ag+, Pb2+, and Hg2+.\n\nSo, PbI2 is insoluble. It will precipitate out.\n\nTherefore, there is a net ionic equation: Pb2+ + 2I- \u2192 PbI2(s)\n\nSo, option C is not the correct choice.\n\nOption D: KOH + HClO4\n\nPotassium hydroxide and perchloric acid. This is an acid-base reaction.\n\nKOH is a strong base, and HClO4 is a strong acid. When they react, they produce water and potassium perchlorate (KClO4).\n\nBoth KOH and HClO4 are soluble, and their reaction is a typical neutralization reaction.\n\nThe net ionic equation is: H+ + OH- \u2192 H2O\n\nSo, in this case, there is a net ionic reaction where hydrogen ions from the acid react with hydroxide ions from the base to form water.\n\nTherefore, option D is not the correct choice because there is a net ionic equation.\n\nNow, going back to option A: Na2SO3 + FeCl2\n\nEarlier, I thought that FeSO3 might be soluble, but I'm a bit unsure now. Maybe I should look it up or think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's no reaction between Na2SO3 and FeCl2 because their possible products, FeSO3 and NaCl, are both soluble.\n\nBut I need to confirm if FeSO3 is indeed soluble.\n\nLet me think differently. If I mix Na2SO3 and FeCl2, would Fe2+ and SO32- form a precipitate?\n\nI recall that some metal ions can form insoluble sulfites, but I'm not sure about iron(II).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a redox reaction between Fe2+ and SO32-, but that seems unlikely under normal conditions.\n\nFor now, I'll stick with my initial thought that FeSO3 is soluble, and therefore, no precipitation occurs.\n\nSo, in this case, all ions remain in solution, and there's no net ionic equation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option A: Na2SO3 + FeCl2.\n\nBut to make sure, let me quickly check again.\n\nOption A: Na2SO3 + FeCl2 \u2192 possible products: FeSO3 and NaCl\n\nBoth FeSO3 and NaCl are soluble.\n\nOption B: CaCl2 + MnSO4 \u2192 CaSO4 precipitates.\n\nOption C: NH4I + Pb(NO3)2 \u2192 PbI2 precipitates.\n\nOption D: KOH + HClO4 \u2192 H2O is formed via neutralization.\n\nTherefore, the only pair where no net ionic equation occurs is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
