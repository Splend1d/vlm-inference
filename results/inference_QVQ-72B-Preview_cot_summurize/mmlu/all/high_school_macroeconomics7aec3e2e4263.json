                    "text": "So I've got this economics problem here about the rice market in the United States. It says that the U.S. produces rice in a competitive market, and with free trade, the world price is lower than the domestic price. I need to figure out what must be true based on these conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for the world price to be lower than the domestic price. In economics, the domestic price is the price determined by the supply and demand within a single country, while the world price is the price in the international market.\n\nSo, if the world price is lower than the domestic price, that suggests that internationally, rice is cheaper than it is in the U.S. This could be because U.S. rice production costs are higher compared to other countries, or perhaps there's less demand for rice in the U.S. relative to supply.\n\nNow, with free trade, it means that the U.S. can import and export goods without restrictions. In this scenario, if the world price is lower than the domestic price, it would be beneficial for the U.S. to import rice rather than produce it domestically because it's cheaper to buy it from abroad.\n\nLet me think about this in terms of supply and demand graphs. Suppose the domestic equilibrium price without trade is higher than the world price. If the U.S. opens up to trade, the domestic price will adjust to the world price. At the lower world price, domestic consumption will increase (since the price is lower), and domestic production will decrease (since the price is lower).\n\nSo, the quantity demanded by consumers in the U.S. will be greater than the quantity supplied by domestic producers. The difference between what's demanded and what's supplied domestically will be filled by imports.\n\nTherefore, the U.S. would start importing rice to make up for the domestic shortage that arises from the decrease in domestic production and the increase in consumption at the lower world price.\n\nLet me see what the options are:\n\nA. The United States begins to import rice to make up for a domestic shortage.\n\nB. The United States begins to export rice to make up for a domestic shortage.\n\nC. The United States begins to import rice to eliminate a domestic surplus.\n\nD. The United States begins to export rice to eliminate a domestic surplus.\n\nBased on my reasoning, option A seems correct. The U.S. would import rice because at the lower world price, domestic production decreases, and consumption increases, leading to a domestic shortage that needs to be filled by imports.\n\nOption B suggests exporting rice to make up for a domestic shortage, which doesn't make sense. If there's a domestic shortage, why would you export? That would make the shortage worse.\n\nOption C says importing rice to eliminate a domestic surplus. If there's a domestic surplus, you wouldn't import more; you'd export the surplus.\n\nOption D suggests exporting rice to eliminate a domestic surplus, which is the opposite of what's happening in this scenario.\n\nSo, based on this, option A is the correct choice.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. If the world price is lower than the domestic price, and with free trade, the U.S. can import at the world price, then yes, it would be cheaper to import rice rather than produce it domestically. This would lead to a decrease in domestic production and an increase in consumption, resulting in net imports to cover the difference.\n\nOn the other hand, if the world price were higher than the domestic price, the U.S. would have an incentive to export rice, as they could sell it for a higher price internationally. But that's not the case here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A: The United States begins to import rice to make up for a domestic shortage.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of exporting rice in this scenario. If the world price is lower than the domestic price, exporting rice would mean selling it at a lower price than what it could be sold for domestically. So, there's no incentive to export rice in this situation.\n\nMoreover, if the U.S. were to export rice at the world price, it would be selling it for less than the domestic price, which wouldn't be profitable for domestic producers. Therefore, exporting rice to make up for a domestic shortage doesn't logical.\n\nIn summary, the correct choice is option A: The United States begins to import rice to make up for a domestic shortage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
