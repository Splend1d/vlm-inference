                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"The strongest base in liquid ammonia is...\" and the options are NH3, NH2-, NH4+, and N2H4. Okay, I need to figure out which one of these is the strongest base when dissolved in liquid ammonia.\n\nFirst off, I know that a base is something that can accept a proton or, in more general terms, donate a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with another atom or molecule. In the context of liquid ammonia, which is a non-aqueous solvent, the behavior of these substances might be different from what I'm used to in water.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with NH3, which is ammonia. In water, ammonia acts as a base because it can accept a proton from water to form NH4+. But here, we're dealing with liquid ammonia, which is the solvent. So, maybe NH3 isn't the strongest base in this environment since it's the solvent itself.\n\nNext is NH2-. This looks like the amide ion, which is derived from ammonia by removing a proton. So, it's already a negatively charged species. I recall that in organic chemistry, the amide ion is a very strong base because it can easily accept a proton.\n\nThen there's NH4+, which is the ammonium ion. This is the conjugate acid of ammonia, so it's actually an acid, not a base. It can donate a proton. So, probably not the strongest base here.\n\nLastly, N2H4, which is hydrazine. I know that hydrazine can act as a base, but I'm not sure how strong it is compared to the other options.\n\nGiven these considerations, NH2- seems like a strong candidate for being the strongest base among these options in liquid ammonia. It's already negatively charged, indicating it's a strong base that can readily accept a proton.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about the acidity and basicity in liquid ammonia. I remember that in non-aqueous solvents, the behavior of acids and bases can differ from what we see in water. Liquid ammonia is a polar solvent with lone pairs on the nitrogen atom, which can form hydrogen bonds with solutes.\n\nIn liquid ammonia, substances that can accept protons or donate electrons can act as bases. NH2- is already an anion, so it's highly basic and should be able to accept protons easily.\n\nComparatively, NH3 is the solvent, so it's like water in an aqueous solution\u2014it's present in large excess, and its basic properties are sort of the background of the solvent.\n\nNH4+ is an acid, so it's not a base.\n\nN2H4, hydrazine, is a base, but I think it's less strong than NH2-. Hydrazine can accept a proton, but since it's not ionized like NH2-, it's probably not as strong.\n\nTherefore, I would conclude that NH2- is the strongest base in liquid ammonia among the given options.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check this. Is NH2- actually soluble in liquid ammonia? I think it is, as it's a polar molecule and should dissolve well in polar solvents like liquid ammonia.\n\nAlso, considering the Bronsted-Lowry definition of acids and bases, NH2- can act as a base by accepting a proton to form NH3, which is the solvent. So, that makes sense.\n\nWhereas NH3, being the solvent, might not behave the same way as when it's dissolved in water. In liquid ammonia, NH3 is the medium, so its basic properties are already accounted for in the solvent.\n\nNH4+ is clearly an acid, so it's out of the question for being a base.\n\nN2H4 is a base, but as I thought earlier, it's less strong than NH2-.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. NH2-\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
