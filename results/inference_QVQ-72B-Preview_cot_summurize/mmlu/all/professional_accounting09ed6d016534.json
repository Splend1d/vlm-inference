The options are about what audit committee members cannot do. So, I need to find out which one of these is not allowed according to the SEC.\n\nOption A says they may not establish procedures for employees to anonymously report fraud. Hmm, that seems like a good practice. I think audit committees are supposed to set up ways for employees to report issues without fear of retaliation. So, I don't think this is something they're prohibited from doing. Maybe it's the opposite\u2014they are required to do this.\n\nOption B says they cannot be responsible for the compensation of any registered public accounting firm employed by the registrant to provide an audit report. Wait, that doesn't sound right. I thought audit committees were responsible for hiring and compensating the auditors. Maybe there's a rule about not being directly involved in compensation. Let me think.\n\nOption C says they cannot accept any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fees from the registrant for services other than as a member of the board. This sounds familiar. I think there are rules about audit committee members not receiving additional fees from the company to maintain their independence. So, maybe this is something they're not allowed to do.\n\nOption D says they cannot engage independent counsel as deemed necessary to carry out their duties. Well, I think audit committees have the authority to hire their own legal advisors or other experts if they need to. So, again, this seems like something they should be able to do.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- A: Setting up anonymous reporting procedures\u2014seems like a good practice, probably allowed.\n\n- B: Being responsible for auditor compensation\u2014might be part of their duties, but perhaps there are restrictions.\n\n- C: Accepting additional fees for services other than board membership\u2014likely prohibited to maintain independence.\n\n- D: Engaging independent counsel\u2014should be allowed for them to fulfill their responsibilities.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems like the one that's prohibited. Audit committee members cannot accept consulting or other fees from the company for services beyond their board roles. That makes sense because it could compromise their independence and objectivity.\n\nI think the answer is C.\n\nWait, let me double-check. I found a reference to the SEC's rules, and it mentions that audit committee members should not accept any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fees from the company, other than their board member fees. Yes, that matches option C.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
