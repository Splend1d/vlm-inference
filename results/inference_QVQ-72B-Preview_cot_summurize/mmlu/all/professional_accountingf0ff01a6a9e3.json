                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Verity Co. and their investments. They bought $200,000 of Otra Co. bonds at par value and $50,000 of U.S. Treasury bills. The Otra bonds are classified as available-for-sale securities, and the Treasury bills are classified as cash equivalents. Now, I need to figure out what amount they should report as net cash used in investing activities in their statement of cash flows. The options are $0, $150,000, $200,000, or $250,000.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what investing activities are in the context of a statement of cash flows. Investing activities typically involve the purchase and sale of long-term assets and other investments outside of everyday operations. So, buying bonds and Treasury bills would generally fall under investing activities.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that the Treasury bills are classified as cash equivalents. I recall that cash equivalents are highly liquid short-term investments that are considered almost as good as cash. They are usually included in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet, and their purchases and sales are typically not included in investing activities in the cash flow statement.\n\nSo, if the Treasury bills are classified as cash equivalents, their purchase should not be included in the investing activities section. Only the purchase of the Otra Co. bonds, which are classified as available-for-sale securities, should be included in investing activities.\n\nLet me double-check that. Available-for-sale securities are investments that are not held for trading purposes but are not necessarily held to maturity. They are still considered investments and should be included in investing activities.\n\nTherefore, the net cash used in investing activities should only include the purchase of the Otra Co. bonds, which is $200,000. The purchase of the Treasury bills, being classified as cash equivalents, should not be included in this section.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's more to it. Is there any possibility that the purchase of cash equivalents could be considered part of investing activities under certain circumstances?\n\nLet me think about this. Generally, no, cash equivalents are not included in investing activities because they are considered part of cash and cash equivalents. Their purchases and sales affect the cash balance itself, not the investing activities.\n\nSo, in this case, the net cash used in investing activities should be $200,000, which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut let's see if there's any trick here. Maybe there's something about the classification that I'm missing.\n\nThe problem states that the Otra bonds are classified as available-for-sale securities and the Treasury bills as cash equivalents. So, my initial thought is that only the Otra bonds purchase affects investing activities, and the Treasury bills purchase affects cash and cash equivalents.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the definition of investing activities. Investing activities include purchases of property, plant, and equipment, as well as investments in other companies through purchasing stocks or bonds.\n\nGiven that, purchasing the Otra Co. bonds fits into this category, while purchasing Treasury bills, being cash equivalents, is more of a cash management decision and doesn't qualify as an investing activity for the purposes of the cash flow statement.\n\nTherefore, the correct amount to report as net cash used in investing activities is $200,000.\n\nI think the answer is C. $200,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
