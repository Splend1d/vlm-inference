On the woman's first day at work, she noticed a sign in the kitchen area that read:\"IMPORTANT NOTICE TO ALL EMPLOYEESEmployees are not permitted to smoke during working hours. Any employee who is found to be in violation of this policy will be fined $50 for the first offense; $100 for the second offense; and fired for the third violation. \"The woman, who was a smoker, read the notice, but did not object or make any comment regarding the restaurant's nonsmoking policy. For six months, the woman worked at the restaurant and never smoked during business hours. One afternoon, the woman was working when an armed robber stormed into the restaurant. He pointed a pistol at the woman and demanded all the money from the cash register. Frightened and panic stricken, the woman handed over the money and then collapsed. Moments later, she regained consciousness and then smoked a cigarette while she regained her composure. Thereafter, the woman resumed her duties for the rest of the day. The next week, however, when the woman received her pay check, she noticed that the restaurant had deducted $50 from her check. A note was attached indicating that the woman was being fined for smoking during business hours. Although the woman protested, the restaurant refused to make any waiver and stood by its policy. In an action by the woman against the restaurant to recover the $50, which of the following is the best argument in the woman's favor?\n\nA. The restaurant's nonsmoking policy concerned a collateral matter that was not incorporated within the terms of their employment contract.\nB. The restaurant impliedly waived the nonsmoking provision by permitting the woman to continue working for the rest of the day.\nC. The nonsmoking provision constituted a constructive condition subsequent that was excused because of temporary impracticability.\nD. The nonsmoking provision concerning disciplinary action is unenforceable, because it attempts to impose a penalty instead of reasonably liquidating the damages, if any, sustained by the restaurant.\n"

                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario about a woman who was fined $50 by her restaurant employer for smoking during business hours after she was robbed at gunpoint. She's trying to get that $50 back, and there are four options for the best argument in her favor. Let me see which one makes the most sense.\n\nFirst, option A says that the restaurant's no-smoking policy concerns a collateral matter that wasn't incorporated into the terms of their employment contract. Hmm, so maybe the no-smoking policy isn't part of the actual employment agreement, meaning they can't enforce it to deduct money from her paycheck. But wait, the notice was in the kitchen, and she read it on her first day. Maybe it's considered part of the employment terms even if it's not written into the contract itself. I'm not sure about that.\n\nOption B says that the restaurant impliedly waived the no-smoking provision by letting her continue working for the rest of the day. So, even though she smoked, they didn't fire her or anything, they just deducted $50 from her paycheck. Maybe by not firing her, they waived the right to enforce the no-smoking rule in this instance. But I'm not sure if that's how waiver works legally. Maybe it's more complicated.\n\nOption C mentions that the no-smoking provision is a constructive condition subsequent that was excused because of temporary impracticability. That sounds pretty legal-ese. A condition subsequent is something that terminates an existing obligation or right after it's been established. So, maybe the no-smoking rule is a condition that, if violated, could terminate her employment. But she wasn't terminated; she was fined. And the term \"constructive\" might imply that it's not explicitly stated but implied by the circumstances. The part about \"temporary impracticability\" suggests that there was a reason she couldn't comply with the rule, which was the robbery and her being in shock. So, maybe in that situation, she couldn't help smoking because of the trauma. That could be a valid argument.\n\nOption D says that the no-smoking provision concerning disciplinary action is unenforceable because it attempts to impose a penalty instead of reasonably liquidating damages, if any, sustained by the restaurant. So, is the $50 fine a penalty, meaning it's just a punishment, or is it meant to compensate the restaurant for some damage caused by her smoking? Probably, it's a penalty because smoking during business hours doesn't directly cause damage to the restaurant, especially in this extreme circumstance. So, maybe the fine is unenforceable because it's a penalty rather than a compensation for actual damages.\n\nNow, comparing these options:\n\n- A suggests the policy isn't part of the contract.\n\n- B suggests the restaurant waived the policy by not firing her.\n\n- C suggests the policy was excused due to impracticability because of extraordinary circumstances.\n\n- D suggests the fine is unenforceable because it's a penalty.\n\nI think option C is the strongest argument here. The circumstances were exceptional\u2014she was robbed at gunpoint, which is a traumatic event. Smoking in that situation might be seen as a reaction to the trauma, not a willful violation of the policy. Therefore, enforcing the fine in this case might be seen as unfair or even illegal due to the exceptional circumstances beyond her control.\n\nOption D is also strong because fines are often considered penalties, which may not be enforceable, especially in employment contracts. However, option C specifically addresses the unique situation that led to her smoking during business hours, which might make it a more compelling argument in this particular case.\n\nSo, I think the best argument in the woman's favor is option C: the no-smoking provision constituted a constructive condition subsequent that was excused because of temporary impracticability due to the traumatic robbery incident.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
