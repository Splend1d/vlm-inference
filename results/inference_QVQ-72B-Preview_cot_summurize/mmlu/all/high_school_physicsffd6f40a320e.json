                    "text": "So I've got this problem about fluid flow through a pipe with different diameters. The flow rate is constant, which I think means that the amount of liquid passing through any cross-section of the pipe stays the same, even though the pipe's diameter changes. That makes sense because if the flow is steady, the liquid shouldn't be piling up anywhere in the pipe.\n\nAt one point in the pipe, the diameter is 2 cm and the flow speed is 18 m/s. Then, at another point, the diameter is 3 cm, and I need to find the flow speed there. The options are 4 m/s, 6 m/s, 8 m/s, or 12 m/s.\n\nFirst, I should recall the equation that relates flow rate, cross-sectional area, and flow speed. I think it's Q = A * v, where Q is the flow rate, A is the area, and v is the velocity of the fluid.\n\nSince the flow rate is constant, Q remains the same at both points. So, A1 * v1 = A2 * v2, where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the two different points in the pipe.\n\nI know v1 is 18 m/s and d1 is 2 cm. v2 is what I need to find, and d2 is 3 cm.\n\nBut wait, the units are different. v1 is in meters per second, but the diameter is in centimeters. I should probably convert the units to be consistent.\n\nLet's convert d1 and d2 to meters. Since 1 m = 100 cm,\n\nd1 = 2 cm = 0.02 m\n\nd2 = 3 cm = 0.03 m\n\nNow, I need to find the cross-sectional area at both points. For a circular cross-section, A = \u03c0 * r^2, where r is the radius.\n\nThe radius is half the diameter, so:\n\nr1 = d1 / 2 = 0.02 m / 2 = 0.01 m\n\nr2 = d2 / 2 = 0.03 m / 2 = 0.015 m\n\nNow, calculate A1 and A2:\n\nA1 = \u03c0 * (0.01)^2 = \u03c0 * 0.0001 m\u00b2 \u2248 0.000314 m\u00b2\n\nA2 = \u03c0 * (0.015)^2 = \u03c0 * 0.000225 m\u00b2 \u2248 0.000706 m\u00b2\n\nNow, using the equation Q = A1 * v1 = A2 * v2\n\nI can solve for v2:\n\nv2 = (A1 * v1) / A2\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nv2 = (0.000314 m\u00b2 * 18 m/s) / 0.000706 m\u00b2\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n\n0.000314 * 18 = 0.005652 m\u00b3/s\n\nThen, divide by A2:\n\nv2 = 0.005652 m\u00b3/s / 0.000706 m\u00b2 \u2248 8 m/s\n\nLooking back at the options, that's choice C. 8 m/s.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the areas:\n\nA1 = \u03c0 * (0.01)^2 = \u03c0 * 0.0001 \u2248 0.000314 m\u00b2\n\nA2 = \u03c0 * (0.015)^2 = \u03c0 * 0.000225 \u2248 0.000706 m\u00b2\n\nQ = A1 * v1 = 0.000314 m\u00b2 * 18 m/s = 0.005652 m\u00b3/s\n\nThen, v2 = Q / A2 = 0.005652 m\u00b3/s / 0.000706 m\u00b2 \u2248 8 m/s\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for flow speed in terms of diameters.\n\nSince Q = A * v and A \u221d r\u00b2, then Q \u221d r\u00b2 * v\n\nBut since Q is constant, r\u00b2 * v is constant.\n\nSo, r1\u00b2 * v1 = r2\u00b2 * v2\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n(0.01)^2 * 18 = (0.015)^2 * v2\n\n0.0001 * 18 = 0.000225 * v2\n\n0.0018 = 0.000225 * v2\n\nNow, solve for v2:\n\nv2 = 0.0018 / 0.000225 = 8 m/s\n\nSame result, 8 m/s.\n\nSo, the flow speed at the second point is 8 m/s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8\\ \\text{m/s}} \\]"
