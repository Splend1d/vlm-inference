                    "text": "So I have this question about aluminum and its electrons. It's asking for the orbital angular momentum quantum number, which is \"l,\" of the electron that's most easily removed when aluminum is ionized from its ground state. The options are A. 3, B. 2, C.1, or D.0.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the quantum number \"l\" represents. I know that \"l\" is related to the shape of the orbital and the angular momentum of the electron. The possible values for \"l\" depend on the principal quantum number \"n,\" and they range from 0 to (n-1). Each value of \"l\" corresponds to a specific subshell: s (l=0), p (l=1), d (l=2), and f (l=3).\n\nNow, aluminum is element number 13 on the periodic table. Its electronic configuration should be 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076 3s\u00b2 3p\u00b9. So, in its ground state, it has two electrons in the 3s orbital and one in the 3p orbital.\n\nThe question is about ionizing aluminum, which means removing one electron to turn it into a positive ion, Al\u207a. The electron that's easiest to remove should be the one with the highest energy, or in other words, the one that's least tightly bound to the nucleus.\n\nIn atomic structure, the energy of an electron depends primarily on its principal quantum number \"n\" and its orbital angular momentum quantum number \"l.\" For the same \"n,\" electrons with higher \"l\" have higher energy because they are more shielded from the nucleus by their angular momentum.\n\nLooking at aluminum's electronic configuration, the outermost electron is in the 3p orbital (l=1). However, there are also electrons in the 3s orbital (l=0), which have a lower \"l\" value but the same \"n\" value.\n\nWait a minute, both 3s and 3p electrons are in the n=3 shell, but p orbitals have l=1, and s orbitals have l=0. According to the general trend, for the same \"n,\" higher \"l\" means higher energy, so the 3p electron should be higher in energy than the 3s electron.\n\nBut in reality, in many atoms, the 3s orbital is lower in energy than the 3p orbital due to penetration effects. The s orbitals penetrate closer to the nucleus, so they experience a stronger nuclear attraction and are lower in energy compared to p orbitals in the same shell.\n\nSo, in aluminum, the 3s electron is actually lower in energy than the 3p electron, meaning the 3p electron should be easier to remove.\n\nBut let me double-check this. The electronic configuration is 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076 3s\u00b2 3p\u00b9. So, the last electron added is the 3p electron, which should be the one that's easiest to remove when ionizing the atom.\n\nTherefore, the orbital angular momentum quantum number \"l\" for this 3p electron is 1.\n\nWait, but the options include l=3, which is f orbitals, but in aluminum, the highest occupied orbitals are 3p, which is l=1.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C.1.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the ionization energy. The first ionization energy of aluminum is the energy required to remove the most weakly bound electron, which should be the 3p electron.\n\nIf I look up the electronic configuration of Al\u207a, it should be 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076 3s\u00b2, which confirms that the 3p electron is removed.\n\nHence, the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the removed electron is l=1.\n\nSo, the answer is C.1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
