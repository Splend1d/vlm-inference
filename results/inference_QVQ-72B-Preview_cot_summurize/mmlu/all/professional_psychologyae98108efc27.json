                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about concurrent individual and group therapy. It says that while it might be necessary for some patients, many therapists don't support it. And there's a list of concerns provided as options. I need to pick the one that's the major concern.\n\nLet me read the options again to make sure I understand them correctly.\n\nOption A says that patients who start with a group might find other sources of support and decide to end individual therapy too soon.\n\nOption B mentions that patients might wait until their individual sessions to react to what happened in the group.\n\nOption C talks about screening procedures possibly being ignored because a therapist is recommending the group experience.\n\nOption D says that patients might use what their two therapists say to contradict suggestions for behavior change from group members.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. I need to think about which of these concerns is the most significant from a therapeutic perspective.\n\nFirst, let's consider Option A. It seems like there's a worry that patients who begin with group therapy might feel supported by the group and decide to stop individual therapy prematurely. That could be a concern if individual therapy is necessary for deeper personal work or for addressing specific issues that are better handled in a one-on-one setting. But is this the main reason therapists are against concurrent therapies?\n\nOption B suggests that patients might hold back their reactions to group sessions until they're in individual therapy. This could potentially disrupt the group process if patients aren't sharing their true feelings and thoughts during the group sessions. It might lead to a less effective group dynamic and could hinder the progress of other members who rely on honest feedback and reactions.\n\nOption C mentions that screening procedures might be ignored because therapists are recommending the group experience. Screening is important to ensure that patients are suitable for group therapy and that the group composition is balanced and safe for everyone involved. If screening is bypassed, it could lead to inappropriate placements that might be harmful to the patient or to the group as a whole.\n\nOption D talks about patients using their two therapists' words to refute suggestions for behavior change from group members. This could create confusion and conflict for the patient, as they might be getting different or conflicting advice from their individual therapist and group members. It could also undermine the authority and effectiveness of the group therapy if the patient is using their individual therapist as a shield against making changes.\n\nNow, I need to decide which of these is the primary concern for therapists who are against concurrent individual and group therapy.\n\nI think Option B is particularly concerning because it affects the integrity of the group process. If patients are not being open and honest in the group setting because they're saving their true reactions for individual sessions, it can significantly impact the group's ability to function effectively. Group therapy relies on members being authentic and sharing their experiences in real-time to benefit both themselves and others in the group.\n\nOption A is also a valid concern, but it seems more related to the patient's commitment to individual therapy rather than the effectiveness of the group therapy itself.\n\nOption C is about the potential neglect of screening procedures, which is important, but it's more of an administrative or procedural concern rather than a direct consequence of concurrent therapies.\n\nOption D is concerning because it could lead to confusion and resistance to change, but it might not be as central to the therapeutic process as the group dynamics issue raised in Option B.\n\nSo, after considering all these points, I think the major concern for therapists who don't support concurrent individual and group therapy is that patients might wait until they're in their individual sessions before reacting to what occurred in the group. That is, Option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
