                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about a linear function with a nonzero slope, and it says that c is less than d. I need to figure out which of these options must be false. Okay, so first things first, since f is a linear function with a nonzero slope, that means it's either increasing or decreasing linearly. It can't be a horizontal line because that would have a zero slope.\n\nSo, f(x) = mx + b, where m is not zero. If m is positive, the function is increasing, and if m is negative, it's decreasing.\n\nNow, c < d, which means that d is larger than c. I need to see what must be false among these options:\n\nA. f(c) = f(d)\n\nB. f(c) \u2260 f(d)\n\nC. f(c) > f(d)\n\nD. f(c) < f(d)\n\nLet's think about each one.\n\nOption A: f(c) = f(d). Well, if the function is linear with a nonzero slope, and c \u2260 d, then f(c) = f(d) only if the slope is zero, which it's not. So, this can't be true. But the question is asking which must be false, so this seems like a candidate for being false.\n\nOption B: f(c) \u2260 f(d). Well, since the slope is nonzero and c \u2260 d, f(c) should not equal f(d). But the question is asking for what must be false, so this is more of a statement that should be true rather than false.\n\nOption C: f(c) > f(d). This could be true depending on the slope. If the slope is negative, then as c increases, f(c) decreases, so if c < d, then f(c) > f(d). So, this could be true in some cases, but not necessarily false.\n\nOption D: f(c) < f(d). Similarly, if the slope is positive, then as c increases, f(c) increases, so if c < d, then f(c) < f(d). Again, this could be true in some cases but not necessarily false.\n\nSo, going back to option A, f(c) = f(d). Since the slope is nonzero, and c \u2260 d, f(c) cannot equal f(d). Because if m \u2260 0, and c \u2260 d, then f(c) \u2260 f(d). So, this must be false.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Suppose m is positive. Then, if c < d, f(c) < f(d). If m is negative, then if c < d, f(c) > f(d). So, in both cases, f(c) \u2260 f(d). Therefore, f(c) = f(d) is impossible unless m = 0, which it's not. So, option A must be false.\n\nOption B, f(c) \u2260 f(d), is actually true based on the above reasoning. So, it's not false.\n\nOption C, f(c) > f(d), can be true if m < 0.\n\nOption D, f(c) < f(d), can be true if m > 0.\n\nTherefore, the only option that must be false is A.\n\nWait, but let's consider if m is zero. But the problem states that the slope is nonzero, so m \u2260 0.\n\nSo, yeah, f(c) = f(d) is impossible because if m \u2260 0 and c \u2260 d, f(c) \u2260 f(d). Hence, option A must be false.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
