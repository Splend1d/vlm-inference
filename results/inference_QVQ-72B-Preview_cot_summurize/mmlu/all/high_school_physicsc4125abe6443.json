                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a slow-moving positron interacting with a stationary electron. I need to figure out which statement correctly describes a possible outcome of this reaction and why it would occur. Let's see, I know that positrons and electrons can annihilate each other, right? But let's think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, what exactly is a positron? It's the antiparticle of the electron, so when they collide, they can annihilate each other, producing other particles or energy. In this case, the electron is stationary, and the positron is moving slowly. So, the total energy before the collision is the rest energy of the electron plus the kinetic energy of the positron.\n\nLet me recall the rest energy of an electron: it's \\(m_0 c^2\\), where \\(m_0\\) is the rest mass of the electron and \\(c\\) is the speed of light. Since both the electron and positron have the same rest mass, the total rest energy is \\(2 m_0 c^2\\). Additionally, the positron has some kinetic energy due to its slow movement.\n\nNow, considering the possible outcomes, option A says that if a single new particle is created, its mass must equal the combined masses of the electron and positron. Hmm, but I thought that in particle physics, when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they typically produce photons or other particles, depending on the energy available. So, if only one particle is created, its mass would have to be less than or equal to the total energy available, which is the sum of the rest energies and the kinetic energy.\n\nWait a minute, but according to the conservation of momentum, if you have two particles colliding and producing one particle, the momentum of that single particle would have to be in the direction of the net momentum before the collision. In this case, since the electron is stationary, the net momentum before the collision is due only to the positron's motion. So, the produced particle would have to carry that momentum.\n\nBut, in practice, I think it's more common for particle-antiparticle annihilation to produce at least two particles to conserve both energy and momentum. For example, producing two photons moving in opposite directions. That way, both energy and momentum are conserved.\n\nOption B says that all new particles created would have no electric charge. Well, the electron has a negative charge, and the positron has a positive charge, so their total charge before the collision is zero. Therefore, the total charge after the collision must also be zero. So, any particles produced must have a net charge of zero, but that doesn't necessarily mean that each particle has zero charge. For example, two photons have zero net charge, or you could have a particle-antiparticle pair where one has a charge and the other has the opposite charge.\n\nOption C states that conservation of momentum indicates that two identical gamma rays moving off in opposite directions could be created. That sounds familiar. If the positron is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest energy. So, most of the energy would be in the form of rest mass energy. If two photons are produced, their total energy would have to be at least \\(2 m_0 c^2\\), and they would have to move in opposite directions to conserve momentum.\n\nOption D says that the antimatter positron could annihilate into energy, leaving the stationary electron behind. But wait, if the positron is annihilated, it's reacting with the electron, and both should be destroyed in the process, producing other particles or energy. So, it doesn't make sense for the electron to be left behind unless there's some mechanism where the electron is not participating in the annihilation, but that seems unlikely.\n\nLet me think about this again. In reality, when a positron and an electron annihilate, they typically produce two gamma rays (photons) moving in opposite directions. This process conserves both energy and momentum. The energy of each photon would be \\(m_0 c^2\\), assuming no kinetic energy is involved, but since the positron has some kinetic energy, that would be added to the total energy of the photons.\n\nSo, option C seems plausible. But let's check option A again. If only one particle is produced, its mass must equal the combined masses of the electron and positron. Is that correct? I don't think so, because in particle physics, the total energy can be converted into different particles, not necessarily ones with the same mass as the original particles.\n\nFor example, if the total energy is sufficient, you could produce a particle-antiparticle pair of heavier particles, as long as their combined mass is less than or equal to the total energy available. But in this case, since the total energy is just \\(2 m_0 c^2\\) plus a small kinetic energy, it's not enough to produce anything heavier than two electrons.\n\nWait, but two electrons can't be produced because that would violate conservation of charge. Two electrons would have a total charge of \\(-2e\\), whereas before the collision, the total charge was zero. So, option A is incorrect because producing a single particle with the combined mass wouldn't satisfy conservation of charge or momentum.\n\nOption B claims that all new particles would have no electric charge. Well, as I thought earlier, the net charge must be zero, but individual particles could have charge as long as there's another particle with opposite charge. However, in the case of producing two photons, both are neutral, so the net charge is zero. But it's not necessarily true that all new particles would have zero charge; it's just that their total charge must sum to zero.\n\nOption C seems to be the most accurate based on what I know about positron-electron annihilation. Producing two gamma rays moving in opposite directions conserves both energy and momentum. The energy of each gamma ray would be \\(m_0 c^2\\) plus half of the positron's kinetic energy, assuming it's shared equally between the two photons.\n\nOption D suggests that the positron annihilates into energy, leaving the stationary electron behind. But that doesn't make sense because both particles are involved in the annihilation process. If they annihilate each other, both should be destroyed, and new particles or energy should be produced.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I think option C is the correct one. Conservation of momentum indicates that two identical gamma rays moving off in opposite directions could be created.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
