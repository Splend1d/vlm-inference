                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these statements describes a skewed distribution. I know that a skewed distribution isn't symmetrical like a normal distribution, which is often called a bell-shaped curve. So, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says it's commonly called the bell-shaped curve. I think that's referring to the normal distribution, which is symmetrical and looks like a bell. Skewed distributions aren't bell-shaped because they have tails that are longer on one side, making them asymmetrical.\n\nOption B says it's symmetrical, with half falling above the mean and half below. That sounds a lot like a normal distribution again, where the mean, median, and mode are all the same, and the distribution is perfectly symmetrical. Skewed distributions, on the other hand, are not symmetrical; they have a longer tail on one side, either to the left or to the right.\n\nOption C says it has asymmetrical frequency distributions. This seems to align with what I know about skewed distributions. Skewed distributions are indeed asymmetrical, meaning that one tail is longer than the other. So, this could be the correct answer.\n\nOption D says it's used most commonly with a large number of data points. I'm not sure about this one. While it's true that distributions can be more clearly defined with larger data sets, I don't think that the skewness of a distribution is directly related to the number of data points. Both normal and skewed distributions can be observed with large or small data sets.\n\nBased on my understanding, option C seems to be the best description of a skewed distribution because it directly refers to the asymmetry in the frequency distribution. Options A and B describe properties of a normal distribution, which is not skewed, and option D doesn't seem directly related to skewness.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think about an example. Suppose I have a set of income data for a group of people. If the distribution is skewed to the right, that means most people earn lower incomes, and a few earn much higher incomes. This would create a long tail on the right side of the distribution, making it asymmetrical. That matches option C.\n\nIn contrast, a normal distribution would have most of the data clustered around the mean, with roughly equal tails on both sides, which isn't the case in a skewed distribution.\n\nSo, I'm confident that option C is the correct choice for describing a skewed distribution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
