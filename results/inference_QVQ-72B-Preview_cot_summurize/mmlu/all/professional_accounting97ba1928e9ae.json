                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about how Poplar City should report its expenditures related to its general obligation bonds. They paid $5000 in interest and $20000 in principal on these bonds, and the payment was made from something called a debt service fund, which got its cash from the general fund earlier in the year. Now, I need to figure out how to report these expenditures in the general fund, the debt service fund, and the permanent fund.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what each of these funds is:\n\n1. **General Fund**: This is typically the main operating fund of a city, used for day-to-day expenses like police, fire, education, etc.\n\n2. **Debt Service Fund**: This fund is specifically set up to manage the payment of principal and interest on a city's debts, like bonds.\n\n3. **Permanent Fund**: This is usually an endowment or a fund that's meant to last forever, with the principal amount remaining intact, and only the earnings are used for specific purposes.\n\nFrom the problem, it says that the payment was made from the debt service fund using cash transferred from the general fund. So, the general fund gave money to the debt service fund, which then made the payment for principal and interest.\n\nNow, I need to figure out how much each fund should report as expenditures.\n\nLet's consider the transactions step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Transfer from General Fund to Debt Service Fund**\n\n- The general fund transfers cash to the debt service fund.\n\n- In the general fund, this would be recorded as an expenditure (or a transfer out), and in the debt service fund, it would be recorded as revenue (or a transfer in).\n\n**Step 2: Debt Service Fund Pays the Bondholders**\n\n- The debt service fund pays $5000 in interest and $20000 in principal to the bondholders.\n\n- In the debt service fund, this would be recorded as expenditures for interest and principal payments.\n\nNow, the question is asking how to report the expenditures in each fund.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. $25000 $25000 $0\n\nB. $0 $25000 $20000\n\nC. $25000 $5000 $0\n\nD. $0 $25000 $0\n\nLet's break this down.\n\n**General Fund:**\n\n- It transferred cash to the debt service fund.\n\n- Should this be reported as an expenditure? Probably, because when funds are transferred from one fund to another, it's often treated as an expenditure in the transferring fund.\n\n**Debt Service Fund:**\n\n- It received cash from the general fund and used it to pay $5000 in interest and $20000 in principal.\n\n- The payment to bondholders should be recorded as expenditures in the debt service fund.\n\n**Permanent Fund:**\n\n- There's no mention of any activity in the permanent fund, so it likely has no expenditures to report in this scenario.\n\nSo, eliminating the permanent fund from consideration, we can focus on the general fund and the debt service fund.\n\nNow, in the general fund:\n\n- If it transferred, say, $25000 to the debt service fund (assuming that's the total amount transferred), then it should report $25000 as an expenditure.\n\nIn the debt service fund:\n\n- It paid $5000 in interest and $20000 in principal, totaling $25000.\n\n- So, it should report $25000 in expenditures.\n\nThis seems to align with option A: $25000 $25000 $0\n\nBut wait, option C is $25000 $5000 $0, which doesn't match because the debt service fund paid $25000 in total, not just $5000.\n\nOption B is $0 $25000 $0, but that doesn't account for the transfer from the general fund.\n\nOption D is $0 $25000 $0, which also doesn't account for the general fund's transfer.\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nBut let me think again.\n\nIn governmental accounting, when one fund transfers resources to another fund, the transferring fund typically records it as an expenditure, and the receiving fund records it as revenue.\n\nHowever, in some cases, these transfers might be considered internal and not reported as expenditures in the general fund, depending on the accounting standards.\n\nBut according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), inter-fund transfers are typically recorded as expenditures in the transferring fund and revenues in the receiving fund.\n\nTherefore, the general fund would record the transfer as an expenditure of $25000, and the debt service fund would record the payment to bondholders as expenditures of $25000.\n\nSo, option A seems correct: $25000 $25000 $0\n\nWait a minute, but option C is $25000 $5000 $0. Why would the debt service fund only report $5000 in expenditures? That doesn't make sense because it paid $20000 in principal as well.\n\nOption B is $0 $25000 $20000, which doesn't seem right because the permanent fund isn't involved in this transaction.\n\nOption D is $0 $25000 $0, which also doesn't account for the general fund's transfer.\n\nTherefore, option A is the most logical choice: $25000 $25000 $0\n\nI think the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
