                    "text": "So I've got this will to interpret, and it's a bit complicated with all these conditions. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the will says the home is devised \"to my friend to whom I am everlastestly grateful for the devoted care she has lavished on my prize Pomeranians, but if ever my dogs who survive me shall fail to receive proper care, then to my beloved son and his heirs, if he be living and own any dogs, otherwise to the American Society for the Protection of Animals.\"\n\nAlright, so the primary beneficiary is the friend who took care of the dogs. But there's a condition: if the dogs don't receive proper care, then the interest shifts to the son and his heirs, provided that the son is alive and owns dogs himself. If not, it goes to the ASPA.\n\nNow, I need to figure out what type of interest the son has under this will, considering the Rule against Perpetuities is in effect.\n\nFirst, let's recall what the Rule against Perpetuities is. It's a legal doctrine that prevents interests in property from being tied up indefinitely. Generally, it requires that any future interest must vest, if at all, within a certain period, often described as \"lives in being plus 21 years\" at the time the interest is created.\n\nNow, looking at the son's interest, it's contingent on two things:\n\n1. The friend fails to provide proper care to the dogs.\n\n2. The son is living and owns dogs.\n\nSo, this seems like an executory interest because it's dependent on certain conditions happening in the future.\n\nLet me think about whether it's a shifting or springing type of executory interest.\n\nA shifting executory interest is one where the interest shifts from one party to another based on a specified condition, and once the condition is met, the interest shifts immediately.\n\nA springing executory interest, on the other hand, is one where the interest springs into existence upon the occurrence of a specified condition.\n\nIn this case, the interest in the son is contingent on the friend failing to provide proper care to the dogs, and also on the son being alive and owning dogs.\n\nSo, it seems like the son's interest is contingent on the friend failing to provide care, and then further contingent on the son's situation at that time.\n\nWait, but the way the will is phrased, it says \"if ever my dogs who survive me shall fail to receive proper care, then to my beloved son and his heirs, if he be living and own any dogs, otherwise to the ASPA.\"\n\nSo, the primary condition is the failure of care by the friend, and then, at that point, it checks if the son is alive and owns dogs. If yes, then to the son and his heirs; if not, to the ASPA.\n\nSo, it's like a contingent remainder, but I need to confirm.\n\nLet me recall that a contingent remainder is an interest that vests upon the occurrence of a specified event, provided that event occurs within the permissible period under the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nIn this case, the event is the friend failing to provide proper care to the dogs.\n\nBut the son's interest is also contingent on him being alive and owning dogs at that time.\n\nSo, it's a bit complex.\n\nLet me consider the timeline:\n\n1. Friend receives the home.\n\n2. If at any time after that, the dogs are not properly cared for, the interest shifts to the son and his heirs, provided he is alive and owns dogs.\n\n3. If not, to the ASPA.\n\nSo, the son's interest is contingent on two things: the friend failing to provide care, and the son being alive and owning dogs at the time the failure is determined.\n\nNow, when does this condition need to be satisfied?\n\nThe Rule against Perpetuities generally looks at when the condition could possibly be met.\n\nIn this case, the condition is the friend failing to provide care, and the son being alive and owning dogs at that time.\n\nThe failure of care could happen at any time after the friend receives the home, as long as it's within the perpetuity period.\n\nSimilarly, the son needs to be alive and owning dogs at the time the failure is determined.\n\nSo, the latest this could happen would be within the perpetuity period.\n\nAssuming that the son could be alive and owning dogs within that period, and the failure could be determined within that period, it might be valid.\n\nBut I need to think about whether this interest violates the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nLet me consider if this is a shifting executory interest or a springing one.\n\nIn a shifting executory interest, the interest shifts from one party to another based on a condition, and the shift happens immediately when the condition is met.\n\nIn this case, if the friend fails to provide care, the interest shifts to the son (if he meets the conditions), otherwise to the ASPA.\n\nSo, it's a shifting executory interest.\n\nNow, does this violate the Rule against Perpetuities?\n\nThe Rule against Perpetuities applies to future interests, and it requires that the interest must vest, if at all, within a certain period.\n\nFor a shifting executory interest, the question is whether the condition precedent can be satisfied within the perpetuity period.\n\nIn this case, the condition is the friend failing to provide care, and the son being alive and owning dogs at that time.\n\nAssuming that the son could be alive and owning dogs within the perpetuity period, and that the failure could be determined within that period, then the interest might be valid.\n\nHowever, the will says \"if ever,\" which could imply at any time in the future, which might not be within the perpetuity period.\n\nBut generally, \"if ever\" is considered to be within the perpetuity period.\n\nSo, perhaps it's valid.\n\nBut let's consider option C: it is an executory interest of a shifting type that is void under the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nIf I think that the condition could be met within the perpetuity period, then it shouldn't be void.\n\nBut maybe there's something about the \"if ever\" that makes it problematic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition regarding the son being alive and owning dogs makes it too uncertain.\n\nWait, the son's being alive is straightforward; it's a life in being.\n\nBut owning dogs is a condition that could change over time.\n\nSo, the son's interest is contingent on him owning dogs at the time the friend fails to provide care.\n\nAssuming that the son could own dogs within the perpetuity period, and that the failure could be determined within that period, then it should be valid.\n\nTherefore, option C seems incorrect.\n\nOption D says it's an executory interest of a springing type that is void under the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nBut in this case, it's more of a shifting executory interest because it's shifting from the friend to the son based on the condition of failure to provide care.\n\nSo, it's not a springing interest; it's a shifting one.\n\nTherefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nOption A says it's a contingent remainder.\n\nA contingent remainder is an interest that vests upon the occurrence of a specified event, provided it occurs within the perpetuity period.\n\nIn this case, the event is the friend failing to provide care, and the son being alive and owning dogs at that time.\n\nSo, it's more accurately described as an executory interest of a shifting type, not a contingent remainder.\n\nTherefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct answer seems to be option B: it is an executory interest of a shifting type.\n\nAnd given that it can vest within the perpetuity period, it shouldn't be void under the Rule against Perpetuities, so option C is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
