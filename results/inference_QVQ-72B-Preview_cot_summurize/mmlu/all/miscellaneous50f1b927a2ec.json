Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me think about what Chapter 11 is.\n\nI remember that Chapter 11 is a part of the United States Bankruptcy Code. It's often referred to as \"reorganization bankruptcy\" because it allows a business to continue operating while it reorganizes its debts and assets. So, in a way, it's like giving the business a chance to restructure and hopefully become profitable again rather than just liquidating all its assets.\n\nOkay, so based on that, filing under Chapter 11 is related to managing debts and financial\u91cd\u7ec4, which sounds a lot like bankruptcy proceedings. But let me make sure. Is filing for Chapter 11 the same as declaring bankruptcy?\n\nWell, bankruptcy is a legal process that deals with the debts of an individual or a business. There are different chapters of bankruptcy, and Chapter 11 is one of them, specifically for businesses or, in some cases, individuals with high levels of debt. So, filing under Chapter 11 is a type of bankruptcy filing.\n\nNow, option A is \"declaring bankruptcy.\" That seems broad, but since Chapter 11 is a specific type of bankruptcy, it falls under that category. So, in a sense, filing under Chapter 11 is a form of declaring bankruptcy.\n\nBut let's look at the other options to make sure there isn't a better answer.\n\nOption B is \"selling stock.\" Hmm, that doesn't seem directly related to Chapter 11. While a business might sell stock as part of its reorganization plan, it's not inherently tied to Chapter 11 filings. So, I don't think this is the correct answer.\n\nOption C is \"buying a smaller company.\" That also doesn't relate directly to Chapter 11. Businesses buy and sell companies all the time without filing for bankruptcy, so this doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nOption D is \"suing the government.\" Again, while legal actions can be part of bankruptcy proceedings, suing the government isn't directly associated with filing under Chapter 11. It's possible, but not the primary action of filing under Chapter 11.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, it seems that A. declaring bankruptcy is the most accurate answer. Filing under Chapter 11 is a specific way a business declares bankruptcy and seeks to reorganize its debts.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. I recall that some people refer to Chapter 11 as \"reorganization bankruptcy,\" which implies that it's not just about declaring bankruptcy and walking away from debts, but rather restructuring them to keep the business afloat.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in that context, filing under Chapter 11 is indeed a form of declaring bankruptcy, but with the intention of reorganizing rather than liquidating.\n\nI think I'm confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
