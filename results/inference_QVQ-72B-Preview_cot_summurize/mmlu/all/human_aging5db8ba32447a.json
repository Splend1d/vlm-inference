                    "text": "So I've got this question here about houses of the future. It says that these houses might let you control almost everything from a central terminal, and that such a house is already in production and is referred to by a specific name. The options are Technohouse, Compuhouse, Futurehouse, and Smarthouse. I need to pick the right term.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a central terminal means in this context. I think it's like a main control panel or a computer system from which you can operate various functions in the house, like lighting, heating, security systems, maybe even appliances. So, it's a centralized system for managing different aspects of the home.\n\nNow, let's consider each option:\n\nA. Technohouse: This sounds cool, but it seems a bit generic. \"Techno\" usually refers to technology, so a technohouse would just be a house filled with technology. But that doesn't specifically describe a house that's controlled from a central terminal.\n\nB. Compuhouse: This one sounds like a house that's heavily reliant on computers. \"Compu\" is short for computer, so a compuhouse would be a house managed by computers. It could imply automation and control systems, which aligns with the idea of a central terminal.\n\nC. Futurehouse: This is pretty straightforward. It's a house of the future, with advanced features and technologies not commonly found in current homes. However, this term seems too broad and doesn't specifically indicate a centralized control system.\n\nD. Smarthouse: This is a term I've heard before, especially in the context of smart homes that can be controlled remotely or automated based on user preferences. A smarthouse typically has a central hub or system that allows you to manage various functions from one place, possibly even using a smartphone or a tablet.\n\nConsidering all this, both Compuhouse and Smarthouse seem relevant, but Smarthouse is a more commonly used term in modern technology and home automation. It's a recognized concept where various systems in the house are interconnected and can be controlled from a single platform or device.\n\nTechnohouse and Futurehouse, while descriptive of a house with advanced technology, don't specifically convey the idea of a centralized control system in the same way that Smarthouse does.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D. Smarthouse.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll think about real-world examples. I know that companies like Google, with their Nest products, and Amazon, with Alexa, offer solutions that turn a regular house into a smarthouse. These systems allow you to control things like thermostats, lights, and security cameras from a central app or interface.\n\nI don't recall any specific projects or common terminology for Technohouse, Compuhouse, or Futurehouse in the same vein. While these terms might make sense in certain contexts, Smarthouse is the established term for a house that can be centrally controlled and automated.\n\nSo, I'm confident that D. Smarthouse is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
