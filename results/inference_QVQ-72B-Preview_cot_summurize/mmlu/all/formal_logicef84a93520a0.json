                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this statement: \"Jos\u00e9 introduces Wilma to Kevin.\" And I need to translate it into predicate logic using the given symbols. The options are A. Iwkj, B. Ijwk, C. Iwjk, D. Ijkw.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the symbol Ixyz means. It says Ixyz: x introduces y to z. So, in this format, x is the person doing the introducing, y is the person being introduced, and z is the person they're being introduced to.\n\nOkay, so in the statement \"Jos\u00e9 introduces Wilma to Kevin,\" Jos\u00e9 is the one doing the introducing, Wilma is the one being introduced, and Kevin is the one she's being introduced to.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Iwkj \u2013 This would mean Wilma introduces Kevin to Jos\u00e9. But that's not what the statement says. The statement says Jos\u00e9 introduces Wilma to Kevin. So, this doesn't match.\n\nB. Ijwk \u2013 This would mean Jos\u00e9 introduces Wilma to Kevin. Wait, that seems to match. Jos\u00e9 (j) introduces Wilma (w) to Kevin (k). Yeah, that seems right.\n\nC. Iwjk \u2013 This would mean Wilma introduces Jos\u00e9 to Kevin. Again, that's not what the statement says. It's Jos\u00e9 introducing Wilma to Kevin.\n\nD. Ijkw \u2013 This would mean Jos\u00e9 introduces Kevin to Wilma. That's the opposite of what the statement says. The statement says Jos\u00e9 introduces Wilma to Kevin, not Kevin to Wilma.\n\nSo, based on this, option B. Ijwk seems to be the correct translation of \"Jos\u00e9 introduces Wilma to Kevin.\"\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In the symbol Ixyz, x is the introducer, y is the one being introduced, and z is the one they're being introduced to. So, for the statement \"Jos\u00e9 introduces Wilma to Kevin,\" x is Jos\u00e9 (j), y is Wilma (w), and z is Kevin (k). So, it should be Ijwk.\n\nOption A is Iwkj, which would be Wilma (w) introducing Kevin (k) to Jos\u00e9 (j). That's different.\n\nOption C is Iwjk, which is Wilma (w) introducing Jos\u00e9 (j) to Kevin (k). Not the same.\n\nOption D is Ijkw, which is Jos\u00e9 (j) introducing Kevin (k) to Wilma (w). That's the opposite of what we need.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is indeed B. Ijwk.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any other way to interpret the symbols based on the given legend.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
