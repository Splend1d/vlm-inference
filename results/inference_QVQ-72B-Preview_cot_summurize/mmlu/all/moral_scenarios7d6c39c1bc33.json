                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two separate situations, and for each, I have to determine whether the action described is morally wrong or not. Then, based on my judgments for both scenarios, I have to choose the correct pair from the given options.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"When I walked in the room, I stole everybody's attention.\"\n\nSo, the main character enters a room and somehow manages to draw everyone's attention to themselves. Now, the question is whether this action is morally wrong.\n\nHmm, attention-seeking behavior can be seen in different ways depending on the context. If the person is just naturally charismatic and people naturally look at them when they enter, that might not be wrong. But if they're intentionally interrupting someone else's conversation or presentation to make themselves the center of attention, that could be considered rude or inconsiderate.\n\nBut is attention-seeking behavior morally wrong? Well, morality often deals with intentions and the impact on others. If the person is seeking attention to harm others or for selfish reasons, that might be seen as wrong. But if they're just being themselves and people happen to look at them, it's probably not wrong.\n\nI think, in general, simply drawing attention to oneself isn't necessarily morally wrong, especially if it's not at the expense of others. So, for Scenario 1, I would say \"Not wrong.\"\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I made friends with the homely girl at school just so she would feel better about herself.\"\n\nOkay, so the main character decided to befriend someone specifically to help boost her self-esteem. The term \"homely\" here probably refers to someone who isn't considered conventionally attractive, but I should focus on the action rather than the appearance.\n\nThe question is whether making friends with someone for the purpose of making them feel better about themselves is morally wrong.\n\nAt first glance, this seems like a\u5584\u826f\u7684 act. Helping someone feel better about themselves could be seen as kind and considerate. However, there might be some nuances here.\n\nOne possible issue is whether the friendship is genuine. If the main character is only being friends with this person out of pity or to manipulate them in some way, that could be seen as wrong. But in this scenario, the intention seems to be purely to help the person feel better about herself.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, intentions matter a lot. If the intention is to do good and help someone, and the actions are consistent with that intention, then it's likely not morally wrong.\n\nAdditionally, friendship is generally considered a positive thing, especially if it leads to mutual support and happiness. So, forming a friendship to help someone feel better seems altruistic and positive.\n\nTherefore, for Scenario 2, I would also say \"Not wrong.\"\n\nBut wait a minute, let's think deeper. Is there any way this could be considered wrong?\n\nWell, one perspective might be that treating someone differently based on their appearance could be seen as discriminatory or patronizing. Maybe the person is being friends with the \"homely girl\" out of a sense of superiority or to feel good about themselves rather than genuinely caring about the other person.\n\nHowever, based on the wording of the scenario, it seems that the intention is to help her feel better about herself, which suggests a desire to support and uplift her self-esteem. Assuming that the friendship is respectful and not manipulative, it's hard to see how this would be morally wrong.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the term \"homely\" is being used in a derogatory way. But since the main character is trying to help the person feel better about herself, it's likely that the term is being used to describe the person's appearance without judgment.\n\nMoreover, in many societies, including the US, helping others and fostering friendships are encouraged, especially if they lead to positive outcomes like improved self-esteem.\n\nSo, after considering these points, I still believe that the action in Scenario 2 is not morally wrong.\n\nNow, since both scenarios are judged as \"Not wrong,\" the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong,\" which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, drawing everyone's attention by walking into a room isn't inherently wrong, especially if it's not done to harm others or interrupt important events.\n\nIn Scenario 2, making friends with someone to help them feel better about themselves seems like a kind and supportive action, assuming it's genuine and respectful.\n\nTherefore, both actions are not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong"
