                    "text": "So I'm trying to answer this question about Hindu mythology. It says that Vishnu has a consort who accompanies him in many of his incarnations and is known as the goddess of good fortune. The options are Parvati, Sita, Sri (Lakshmi), and Sarasvati.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a consort is. In mythology, a consort is typically the spouse of a god or goddess. So, in this case, it's about Vishnu's wife or main female companion in his various incarnations.\n\nVishnu is one of the main gods in Hinduism, part of the Trimurti, which includes Brahma and Shiva. He's often depicted as the preserver of the universe, and he takes on different avatars to restore cosmic order.\n\nNow, the question mentions that this consort accompanies him in many of his incarnations and is known as the goddess of good fortune. That sounds like a pretty specific description.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Parvati: She is usually associated with Shiva, not Vishnu. Parvati is the goddess of fertility, love, and devotion. She's Shiva's consort and plays a significant role in Shiva's stories. So, I don't think Parvati is the right answer.\n\nB. Sita: Sita is a figure from the Ramayana, which is a story about Rama, who is an avatar of Vishnu. Sita is Rama's wife and is known for her devotion and purity. However, Sita is specific to the Rama avatar and isn't present in all of Vishnu's incarnations. So, probably not the consort who accompanies him in many incarnations.\n\nC. Sri (Lakshmi): Lakshmi is widely recognized as the goddess of wealth, prosperity, and good fortune. She is often depicted alongside Vishnu and is considered his consort. In many myths, she appears whenever Vishnu takes an avatar; for example, in the avatar of Rama, she is Sita, and in the avatar of Krishna, she is Radha. So, this seems to fit the description quite well.\n\nD. Sarasvati: Sarasvati is the goddess of knowledge, music, art, wisdom, and learning. She is sometimes considered the consort of Brahma, the creator god, but not of Vishnu. So, she doesn't fit the description of being Vishnu's consort in his various incarnations.\n\nBased on this analysis, it seems that Sri (Lakshmi) is the correct answer. She is consistently associated with Vishnu across multiple incarnations and is known as the goddess of good fortune.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll recall some specific examples. In the avatar of Varaha, the boar incarnation, Lakshmi is said to have accompanied him as his consort. Similarly, in the Narasimha avatar, she was present as his companion. This pattern continues in various other avatars, reinforcing her role as his primary consort.\n\nMoreover, in Hindu theology, Lakshmi and Vishnu are often depicted together in temples and during festivals, emphasizing their connection and importance as a divine couple.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. Sri (Lakshmi).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
