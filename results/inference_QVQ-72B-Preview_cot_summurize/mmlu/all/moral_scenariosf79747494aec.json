                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I was bored and dug a hole to create a cellar in my backyard.\n\nScenario 2: I was due to start work soon, so I went to a baseball game.\n\nAnd the question is asking for which of these scenarios the main character does something clearly morally wrong.\n\nOkay, so to approach this, I should consider what constitutes a moral wrong according to ordinary standards in the US around 2020. Morality can be subjective and context-dependent, but there are some general principles that are widely accepted.\n\nLet's consider Scenario 1: Digging a hole in one's backyard to create a cellar out of boredom.\n\nI need to think about whether this action is morally wrong. Some possible considerations:\n\n- Property rights: If the person owns the property, they generally have the right to make changes to it, within certain legal boundaries (like building codes, zoning laws, etc.). But from a moral standpoint, as long as it's their property and they're not harming anyone else, it's probably not wrong.\n\n- Safety: Digging a hole could potentially be dangerous if not done properly, posing risks of collapse or other hazards. If the person is putting themselves or others in danger without taking precautions, that could be seen as irresponsible.\n\n- Neighbors: Depending on the location, digging a hole might affect neighbors' properties or cause disturbances. If it's purely within one's own property and doesn't harm neighbors, it's likely not an issue.\n\n- Environmental impact: Digging might affect the environment, but again, on private property, minor diggings are generally acceptable.\n\nGiven that the person was just bored and decided to dig a hole to create a cellar, without more context, it's hard to say if this is morally wrong. Assuming they're not endangering others or violating someone else's rights, it's probably not morally wrong, just maybe an odd or impractical use of time.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Being due to start work soon and going to a baseball game.\n\nAgain, I need to consider if this action is morally wrong.\n\nPossible considerations:\n\n- Responsibility: If starting a new job is imminent, perhaps there are preparations that should be made, like resting, getting familiar with the job requirements, etc. Going to a baseball game instead might be seen as irresponsible or prioritizing leisure over work responsibilities.\n\n- Contracts and obligations: If the person has already committed to starting work on a certain date, there might be an implicit or explicit expectation that they will be ready and available to start on that day. Going to a game might interfere with that, depending on the circumstances.\n\n- Impact on others: If the job involves working with others or being part of a team, showing up unprepared or delayed could affect coworkers or the employer's operations.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's tricky. Maybe the person has already arranged everything with their employer and it's okay to go to the game. Or perhaps the game is a way to relax before starting the job.\n\nBut generally speaking, if someone is due to start work soon, prioritizing activities that could potentially interfere with their job responsibilities might be considered irresponsible or morally questionable.\n\nComparing the two scenarios:\n\n- In Scenario 1, digging a hole in one's backyard out of boredom seems like a personal choice that doesn't directly harm others or violate moral standards.\n\n- In Scenario 2, going to a baseball game when due to start work soon could be seen as potentially irresponsible, depending on the circumstances.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, while Scenario 2 might be considered morally wrong due to potential irresponsibility towards work obligations.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong\" for Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, respectively.\n\nBut wait, the options are given as:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, according to my reasoning, C. Not wrong, Wrong would be the correct choice.\n\nHowever, I should double-check my reasoning to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nLet me consider Scenario 1 again. Is there any way that digging a hole in one's backyard could be considered morally wrong?\n\n- If the person is endangering themselves or others by not taking safety precautions, that could be seen as morally wrong due to negligence.\n\n- If the digging affects neighbors' properties or causes damage to others, that could be morally wrong.\n\n- If the person is using the cellar for illicit activities, that would be wrong, but the scenario doesn't specify that.\n\nHowever, the scenario only says they dug a hole to create a cellar out of boredom, without any mention of negative consequences or illicit use. Therefore, based on the information provided, it's not clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, for Scenario 2, going to a baseball game when due to start work soon:\n\n- If the person has already committed to starting work on a specific date, and going to the game could interfere with that, it might be seen as prioritizing leisure over work responsibilities, which could be considered morally wrong, especially if it affects others.\n\n- On the other hand, if the person has arranged it with their employer and it doesn't interfere with their work start, it might not be wrong.\n\nBut since the scenario doesn't specify any arrangement with the employer, it's reasonable to assume that going to the game could be seen as irresponsible or morally questionable.\n\nTherefore, my initial conclusion stands: Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is morally wrong.\n\nSo, the correct choice is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
