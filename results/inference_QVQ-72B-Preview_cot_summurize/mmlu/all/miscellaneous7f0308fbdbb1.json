Hmm, I think I know the answer, but I want to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me consider each option one by one.\n\nFirst, option A is red. I've always thought that rubies are red gems. In fact, the name \"ruby\" comes from the Latin word \"ruber,\" which means red. That seems pretty straightforward. But just because I think something doesn't mean it's necessarily correct, right? Maybe there are different colors of rubies that I don't know about.\n\nLet me think about option B, black. I don't recall ever seeing a black ruby. Black stones like onyx or jet are known for their black color, but rubies are typically red. Maybe there are some rubies with a dark hue that could be almost black, but I don't think that's the general color association.\n\nOption C is yellow. Yellow is usually associated with another gemstone, like topaz or citrine. Rubies are red, not yellow. I can't imagine a yellow ruby being referred to as a ruby; perhaps there's a different name for yellow gems in that category.\n\nLastly, option D is blue. Blue is the color typically associated with sapphires. Sapphires and rubies are both varieties of corundum, which is aluminum oxide, but they differ in color due to different trace elements. Rubies get their red color from chromium, while sapphires can be various colors, but blue is the most common. So, blue isn't the color of a ruby.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there are different colored rubies at all. I know that diamonds can be colorless, yellow, pink, and even blue, but they're still called diamonds regardless of color. Is that the same with rubies?\n\nUpon a quick search in my mind, I remember that rubies are primarily red, but there might be some variations in shade, like pinkish-red or dark red. However, I don't think yellow or blue are considered rubies. Perhaps if a ruby has a hint of another color, it might be described differently, but the base color is still red.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the question is trying to trick me by including other colors that aren't typically associated with rubies. But it seems pretty straightforward. The answer should be red.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider the definition of a ruby. A ruby is a gemstone, specifically a red variety of corundum. Corundum is aluminum oxide, and the red color comes from trace amounts of chromium. So, chemically, it's defined by its red color.\n\nContrast that with sapphires, which can be blue, yellow, pink, etc., depending on the trace elements present. But even then, a pink sapphire is still considered a sapphire, even though it's not blue. So, perhaps there are some exceptions, but the primary color for rubies is red.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The question is simple: what color is a ruby? And the answer is red. So, option A is the correct choice.\n\nWait, just to double-check, I'll recall some famous rubies. There's the Hope Diamond, but that's a diamond, not a ruby. Then there's the Black Prince's Ruby, which is actually a red spinel, not a ruby. Hmm, maybe not all red gems are rubies, but that's a different story.\n\nLet me think of some well-known rubies. There's the Cartier Ruby, which is red, and the Graff Ruby, also red. I don't recall any famous rubies that are yellow or blue.\n\nPerhaps yellow sapphires are sometimes called yellow rubies, but that seems unlikely. No, I think yellow sapphires are their own category.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I'm confident that the correct answer is A. red.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ red}} \\]"
