                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have a real vector space \\( V \\) of finite dimension \\( n \\), and \\( M(V) \\) is the set of linear transformations from \\( V \\) to itself, which can also be thought of as \\( n \\times n \\) matrices if we choose a basis for \\( V \\). We're given a linear transformation \\( T \\in M(V) \\), and we're considering two subspaces: \\( U = \\{X \\in M(V) : TX = XT\\} \\) and \\( W = \\{TX - XT : X \\in M(V)\\} \\).\n\nWe need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true.\n\nFirst, let's understand what \\( U \\) and \\( W \\) represent.\n\n\\( U \\) is the set of all matrices that commute with \\( T \\), i.e., \\( TX = XT \\) for all \\( X \\in U \\).\n\n\\( W \\) is the set of all commutators of \\( T \\) with matrices in \\( M(V) \\), i.e., \\( TX - XT \\) for all \\( X \\in M(V) \\).\n\nStatement I says: If \\( V \\) has a basis consisting only of eigenvectors of \\( T \\), then \\( U = M(V) \\).\n\nThis is interesting. If \\( T \\) is diagonalizable, meaning it has a full set of eigenvectors forming a basis for \\( V \\), then any matrix that commutes with \\( T \\) must be diagonal in that basis. Wait, is that right?\n\nLet me think about diagonalizability. If \\( T \\) is diagonalizable, then there exists a basis of \\( V \\) consisting of eigenvectors of \\( T \\). In this basis, \\( T \\) is represented by a diagonal matrix. Now, if \\( X \\) commutes with \\( T \\), i.e., \\( TX = XT \\), then in this basis, \\( X \\) must also be diagonal. Because if \\( T \\) is diagonal, and \\( X \\) is diagonal, their product is the same regardless of the order. If \\( X \\) had off-diagonal entries, multiplying by \\( T \\) would mix those entries in a way that wouldn't commute.\n\nSo, in this case, \\( U \\) consists of all diagonal matrices in this basis. But since we're working with \\( M(V) \\), which is all linear transformations, and we're considering the representation in a particular basis, \\( U \\) would correspond to all diagonal matrices in that basis.\n\nHowever, \\( M(V) \\) is the entire space of \\( n \\times n \\) matrices, which includes non-diagonal matrices. So, unless \\( T \\) is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, \\( U \\) wouldn't be equal to \\( M(V) \\). If \\( T \\) is a scalar multiple of the identity, then every matrix commutes with \\( T \\), so \\( U = M(V) \\).\n\nBut the statement says \"if \\( V \\) has a basis consisting only of eigenvectors of \\( T \\)\", which is true if and only if \\( T \\) is diagonalizable. However, even if \\( T \\) is diagonalizable, \\( U \\) is not necessarily equal to \\( M(V) \\), unless \\( T \\) is a scalar multiple of the identity.\n\nTherefore, statement I is not necessarily true. It would only be true if \\( T \\) is a scalar multiple of the identity, which is a very specific case.\n\nAlright, moving on to statement II: \\( \\dim(U) + \\dim(W) = n^2 \\).\n\nThis looks familiar. It resembles the dimension formula for subspaces of a vector space. Specifically, if \\( U \\) and \\( W \\) are subspaces of \\( M(V) \\), and if they are related in a certain way, their dimensions might satisfy this equation.\n\nI recall that for any two subspaces \\( S \\) and \\( T \\) of a vector space, \\( \\dim(S) + \\dim(T) - \\dim(S \\cap T) = \\dim(S + T) \\). But here, \\( U \\) and \\( W \\) are related through \\( T \\), so maybe there's a similar relationship.\n\nLet me consider the map \\( \\phi: M(V) \\to M(V) \\) defined by \\( \\phi(X) = TX - XT \\). This is a linear map, and its kernel is \\( U \\), since \\( \\phi(X) = 0 \\) if and only if \\( TX = XT \\). The image of \\( \\phi \\) is \\( W \\).\n\nIn linear algebra, for any linear map, the dimension of the domain is equal to the dimension of the kernel plus the dimension of the image, i.e., \\( \\dim(\\ker \\phi) + \\dim(\\text{im } \\phi) = \\dim(M(V)) = n^2 \\).\n\nSo, in this case, \\( \\ker \\phi = U \\) and \\( \\text{im } \\phi = W \\), which means \\( \\dim(U) + \\dim(W) = n^2 \\). This seems to hold regardless of the specific choice of \\( T \\), as long as \\( M(V) \\) has dimension \\( n^2 \\).\n\nTherefore, statement II is always true.\n\nNow, statement III: \\( \\dim(U) < n \\).\n\nThis is claiming that the dimension of the subspace of matrices that commute with \\( T \\) is less than \\( n \\).\n\nBut is this always true? Let's think about different possibilities for \\( T \\).\n\nIf \\( T \\) is the zero matrix, then \\( TX = XT = 0 \\) for any \\( X \\), so \\( U = M(V) \\), which has dimension \\( n^2 \\), which is certainly larger than \\( n \\). So in this case, statement III is false.\n\nIf \\( T \\) is the identity matrix, then \\( TX = X = XT \\), so again, \\( U = M(V) \\), and \\( \\dim(U) = n^2 > n \\), unless \\( n = 1 \\). Even in that case, \\( n^2 = 1 \\), which is not less than \\( n = 1 \\). So statement III is false in this case as well.\n\nWhat if \\( T \\) is a non-scalar multiple of the identity? For example, consider \\( T \\) to be a diagonal matrix with distinct diagonal entries. Then, as we saw earlier, \\( U \\) consists of diagonal matrices in that basis, so \\( \\dim(U) = n \\), which is not less than \\( n \\). So again, statement III is false.\n\nAlternatively, if \\( T \\) is nilpotent but not zero, say \\( T^k = 0 \\) for some \\( k \\), what would \\( U \\) look like? I'm not sure off the top of my head, but it's possible that \\( \\dim(U) \\) could be larger than \\( n \\).\n\nIn any case, from the examples above, it seems that \\( \\dim(U) \\) can be equal to \\( n^2 \\), which is larger than \\( n \\), so statement III is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true is statement II.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. II only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{B}"
