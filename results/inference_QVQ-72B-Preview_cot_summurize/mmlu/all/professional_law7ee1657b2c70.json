As he drove down a small hill toward an intersection with a stop sign, he applied the brakes, but they failed to work, and the truck did not slow down. The farmer could not stop for the stop sign. He saw a pedestrian crossing the street at the intersection and tried to steer around him, but was unable to do so. The pickup truck struck the pedestrian and seriously injured him. If the injured pedestrian asserts a negligence claim against the auto dealership that sold the truck to the farmer, and if it is conclusively proven that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect in the car, will the pedestrian prevail?\n\nA. No, because the pedestrian was not a purchaser or user of the truck.\nB. No, if the farmer was negligent in being unable to steer around and avoid hitting the pedestrian.\nC.

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out if the pedestrian can successfully sue the auto dealership for negligence because the brakes on the truck failed, leading to an accident that injured the pedestrian. The brake failure is due to a manufacturing defect, and this is conclusively proven. The question is asking whether the pedestrian will prevail in a negligence claim against the dealership.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what negligence means in this context. Negligence typically involves failing to exercise reasonable care, resulting in harm to someone else. So, the pedestrian is claiming that the dealership was negligent in selling a truck with defective brakes, which caused the accident.\n\nOption A says \"No, because the pedestrian was not a purchaser or user of the truck.\" Hmm, that seems like a possible defense, but I think in product liability cases, it's not just limited to the purchaser. Sometimes, third parties who are injured by defective products can also sue.\n\nOption B says \"No, if the farmer was negligent in being unable to steer around and avoid hitting the pedestrian.\" This introduces the idea that the farmer might have contributed to the accident. But since the brakes failed due to a manufacturing defect, the farmer might not have been able to avoid the accident even if he tried to steer around.\n\nOption C says \"Yes, because the auto dealer placed a defective car into the stream of commerce.\" This seems relevant. If the dealership sold a defective product that caused injury, they might be liable for negligence.\n\nOption D says \"Yes, if the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the auto dealer.\" This suggests that the dealership might be responsible if they should have known about the defect.\n\nI need to think about this more carefully. In negligence claims related to product defects, there are a few key elements:\n\n1. Duty of care: The dealership has a duty to ensure that the vehicles they sell are safe and free from defects.\n\n2. Breach of duty: If they sell a vehicle with a known or should-have-been-known defect, that's a breach.\n\n3. Causation: The defect must have caused the injury.\n\n4. Damages: The pedestrian was injured as a result.\n\nIn this case, the brake failure is due to a manufacturing defect, which is something that happened during the production process, not something the farmer caused. So, the defect was present when the truck was sold.\n\nNow, the pedestrian is not the purchaser, but in many jurisdictions, third parties who are injured by defective products can sue the seller or manufacturer for negligence.\n\nLet me consider if the pedestrian has standing to sue the dealership. Standing usually refers to whether the plaintiff has a sufficient connection to the case to justify their involvement. In product liability cases, it's common for third parties who are injured by defective products to have standing to sue.\n\nSo, option A suggesting that the pedestrian can't sue because they weren't the purchaser seems incorrect based on that.\n\nNext, option B mentions the farmer's potential negligence in not steering around the pedestrian. But if the brakes failed due to a manufacturing defect, the farmer might not have had control over the situation. Even if he tried to steer, the truck might have been moving too fast to avoid the pedestrian. So, it's possible that the farmer wasn't negligent, and the accident was solely caused by the defective brakes.\n\nHowever, in some legal systems, there might be a concept of comparative negligence, where if the farmer could have done something differently, it might affect the dealership's liability. But I think in this scenario, since the defect is the primary cause, the dealership would still be liable.\n\nOption C says yes because the dealership placed a defective car into the stream of commerce. This seems straightforward. By selling a defective product, the dealership is putting something dangerous into the market, which can lead to liability if someone gets hurt as a result.\n\nOption D adds a condition: the defect could have been discovered through reasonable care by the dealership. This introduces the idea that the dealership might be liable only if they should have known about the defect.\n\nI need to consider whether the dealership had a duty to inspect the brakes or ensure they were working properly before selling the truck.\n\nIn general, car dealerships are expected to perform certain checks and inspections before selling a vehicle. They might run diagnostic tests, inspect the brakes, and ensure that everything is in working order.\n\nIf the defect was something that a reasonable inspection would have revealed, then the dealership might be liable for not catching it. However, if the defect was latent and not discoverable through normal inspection methods, then perhaps the dealership isn't liable.\n\nBut in this scenario, it's stated that the defect is a manufacturing defect, meaning it was present when the truck was made, and it's conclusively proven.\n\nSo, if the dealership should have discovered the defect through reasonable inspection, then they might be liable. If not, then maybe not.\n\nBut wait, in some product liability cases, the seller can be liable even if they didn't know about the defect, as long as the product is defective and caused injury.\n\nThis is where it gets a bit complicated. I think I need to look into product liability laws, particularly regarding negligence and strict liability.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, there are two main theories for product liability:\n\n1. Negligence: The seller or manufacturer failed to exercise reasonable care in making or selling the product.\n\n2. Strict liability: The seller is liable for injuries caused by a defective product, regardless of whether they were negligent, as long as the product is unreasonably dangerous and caused the injury.\n\nIn this scenario, the question specifies a negligence claim, not a strict liability claim. So, we're focusing on negligence.\n\nUnder negligence, the plaintiff would need to prove that the dealership breached their duty to sell a safe product, and that breach caused the injury.\n\nNow, if the defect is a manufacturing defect that the dealership should have discovered through reasonable inspection, then they might be negligent.\n\nBut if the defect was not discoverable by the dealership, perhaps the manufacturer would be more liable.\n\nHowever, in some cases, the dealership might still be liable even if they didn't know about the defect, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nI think the key here is that the defect is conclusively proven to be a manufacturing defect, meaning it was present when the truck was made, and it's not something the farmer did.\n\nSo, if the dealership should have caught it during their inspection processes, then they might be negligent.\n\nBut if it was something that wasn't discoverable through reasonable inspection, then maybe not.\n\nOption D seems to capture this idea: yes, the pedestrian will prevail if the defect could have been discovered through reasonable care by the dealership.\n\nOption C just says yes because the dealership placed a defective car into the stream of commerce, without considering whether they should have known about the defect.\n\nSo, option D is more precise in stating the condition under which the pedestrian would prevail.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"will the pedestrian prevail?\" and it's conclusive that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect.\n\nIf the defect is a manufacturing defect, and it's conclusively proven, then it's likely that the dealership should have known about it or could have discovered it through reasonable inspection.\n\nUnless the defect was something that only manifested over time and couldn't have been detected at the time of sale, perhaps.\n\nBut in this scenario, it's not specified that the defect was latent or not detectable at the time of sale.\n\nSo, assuming that the defect could have been discovered through reasonable care, then option D seems correct.\n\nBut the question is phrased in a way that suggests that it's conclusively proven that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect.\n\nSo, if that's the case, and if the dealership should have known about it, then the pedestrian will prevail.\n\nBut if the dealership couldn't have known about it, then maybe not.\n\nHowever, the question seems to suggest that the pedestrian will prevail, given the defect is conclusively proven.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is C, that the pedestrian will prevail because the dealership placed a defective car into the stream of commerce.\n\nBut option D adds the condition that the defect could have been discovered through reasonable care.\n\nI think option D is more accurate because it specifies the condition under which the dealership would be negligent.\n\nOption C is too broad; it doesn't account for whether the dealership knew or should have known about the defect.\n\nWhereas option D says yes, if the defect could have been discovered through reasonable care.\n\nSo, if the defect was discoverable through reasonable inspection, then the dealership was negligent in not discovering it, and the pedestrian will prevail.\n\nIf the defect wasn't discoverable through reasonable care, then perhaps the pedestrian wouldn't prevail in a negligence claim against the dealership.\n\nBut in this scenario, since it's a manufacturing defect, and it's conclusively proven, it's likely that the defect could have been discovered through reasonable inspection.\n\nUnless the defect was extremely rare or only manifested under specific conditions, which isn't stated here.\n\nGiven that, I think the pedestrian will prevail, provided that the defect could have been discovered through reasonable care.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: Yes, if the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the auto dealer.\n\nBut the way the question is phrased, it seems like the pedestrian will prevail, given that the defect is conclusively proven.\n\nSo, perhaps option C is also correct, but option D is more precise in specifying the condition.\n\nI think the best answer is D, as it specifies the condition under which the dealership would be negligent.\n\nOption C is too general and doesn't account for whether the dealership knew or should have known about the defect.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
