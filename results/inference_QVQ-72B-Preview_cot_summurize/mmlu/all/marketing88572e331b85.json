Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what market segmentation is. It's about dividing a broad market into smaller groups of consumers who have similar needs or characteristics. So, the idea is to target specific groups more effectively than trying to reach everyone with a single marketing strategy.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. The firm must avoid focusing on non-variables such as profitability and volume.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit confusing. Profitability and volume are actually important metrics for a business. Profitability helps determine if serving a particular segment is worthwhile, and volume indicates the potential sales. So, I think this option is suggesting not to focus on these, but that doesn't seem right. We should be considering profitability and volume when segmenting markets, not ignoring them.\n\nB. The market segment must have measurable purchasing power and size.\n\nThis makes sense. If I'm going to target a specific segment, I need to know how big it is and whether the people in that segment have the ability to buy my product or service. Measurable purchasing power and size seem crucial for making informed decisions about which segments to pursue.\n\nC. The company must expand beyond its marketing capabilities to capture growing markets.\n\nWait a minute, this seems a bit off. Typically, companies should operate within their capabilities unless they have plans to grow those capabilities. Expanding beyond marketing capabilities might not be prudent, as it could lead to overextension and inefficiencies. So, this doesn't seem like a basic requirement for effective market segmentation.\n\nD. The market segment must reflect the population's changing attitudes and lifestyles.\n\nThis is interesting. Markets do change over time as consumer preferences evolve, so considering current and future attitudes and lifestyles is important. However, this might be more of a consideration for positioning or product development rather than a fundamental requirement for segmentation itself.\n\nGiven these thoughts, option B seems the most straightforward and essential requirement for effective market segmentation. Without measurable purchasing power and size, it's hard to justify allocating resources to a particular segment.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other requirement that might be equally important. For example, accessibility: the segment should be reachable through marketing and distribution channels. That's also important, but it's not listed here.\n\nAnother key aspect is differentiability: the segments should respond differently to marketing mix variables. Again, not mentioned in the options.\n\nSo, among the given choices, B stands out as the most basic and necessary requirement. If a market segment isn't measurable in terms of purchasing power and size, it's going to be very difficult to assess its potential and allocate resources effectively.\n\nI think the answer is B. The market segment must have measurable purchasing power and size.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
