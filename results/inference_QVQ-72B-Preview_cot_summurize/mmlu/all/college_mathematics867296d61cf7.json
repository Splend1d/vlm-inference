                    "text": "So I've got this sequence defined by x\u2081 = 1 and x_{n+1} = sqrt(3 + 2x_n) for all positive integers n. The problem says to assume that the sequence converges, and I need to find the limit it converges to. The options are 3, e, sqrt(5), or 0.\n\nFirst, since we're assuming the sequence converges, that means that as n approaches infinity, x_n approaches some finite number, let's call it L. So, if x_n is getting closer and closer to L, then x_{n+1} should also be getting closer and closer to L. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\nL = sqrt(3 + 2L)\n\nNow, I need to solve for L. To get rid of the square root, I'll square both sides:\n\nL\u00b2 = 3 + 2L\n\nThen, I'll rearrange the equation to set it to zero:\n\nL\u00b2 - 2L - 3 = 0\n\nNow, I can use the quadratic formula to solve for L. The quadratic formula is:\n\nL = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 + 12)] / 2\n\nSimplifying inside the square root:\n\nL = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(16)] / 2\n\nWhich is:\n\nL = [2 \u00b1 4] / 2\n\nSo, two possible solutions:\n\nL = (2 + 4)/2 = 6/2 = 3\n\nAnd\n\nL = (2 - 4)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1\n\nBut a limit of a sequence of positive terms (since x\u2081 = 1 and each x_{n+1} = sqrt(3 + 2x_n), which is positive if x_n is positive) can't be negative. So, L = -1 is not plausible here.\n\nTherefore, L = 3.\n\nWait a minute, but one of the options is e, which is approximately 2.718, and another is sqrt(5), which is about 2.236. Both are less than 3, and 0 is obviously not the answer since the sequence is increasing and starts at 1.\n\nBut according to my calculation, L should be 3. Let me double-check the quadratic equation.\n\nStarting from:\n\nL\u00b2 - 2L - 3 = 0\n\nCoefficients: a = 1, b = -2, c = -3\n\nQuadratic formula:\n\nL = [ -(-2) \u00b1 sqrt((-2)^2 - 4*1*(-3)) ] / (2*1)\n\nWhich is:\n\nL = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 + 12)] / 2\n\nL = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(16)] / 2\n\nL = [2 \u00b1 4] / 2\n\nSo, L = 3 or L = -1\n\nSince L = -1 doesn't make sense in this context, L = 3 is the correct limit.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check if the sequence actually converges to 3.\n\nLet's consider the function f(x) = sqrt(3 + 2x)\n\nIf I plug in L = 3:\n\nf(3) = sqrt(3 + 2*3) = sqrt(9) = 3\n\nSo, it satisfies L = f(L), which is consistent with L = 3.\n\nIf I plug in L = e \u2248 2.718:\n\nf(e) = sqrt(3 + 2*e) \u2248 sqrt(3 + 5.436) \u2248 sqrt(8.436) \u2248 2.904, which is not equal to e (2.718), so e is not the limit.\n\nSimilarly, for L = sqrt(5) \u2248 2.236:\n\nf(sqrt(5)) = sqrt(3 + 2*sqrt(5)) \u2248 sqrt(3 + 4.472) \u2248 sqrt(7.472) \u2248 2.733, which is not equal to sqrt(5), so that's not the limit.\n\nAnd L = 0:\n\nf(0) = sqrt(3 + 0) = sqrt(3) \u2248 1.732, which is not zero, so not the limit.\n\nTherefore, the only possible limit that satisfies L = f(L) is L = 3.\n\nBut the problem says \"if it is assumed that {x_n} converges\", and we've assumed it converges to L, and found L = 3.\n\nHowever, to ensure that the sequence does indeed converge to 3, maybe I should check the behavior of the sequence.\n\nLet's look at the first few terms to see the pattern.\n\nWe have x\u2081 = 1\n\nx\u2082 = sqrt(3 + 2*1) = sqrt(5) \u2248 2.236\n\nx\u2083 = sqrt(3 + 2*sqrt(5)) \u2248 sqrt(3 + 4.472) \u2248 sqrt(7.472) \u2248 2.733\n\nx\u2084 = sqrt(3 + 2*sqrt(3 + 2*sqrt(5))) \u2248 sqrt(3 + 2*2.733) \u2248 sqrt(3 + 5.466) \u2248 sqrt(8.466) \u2248 2.91\n\nx\u2085 = sqrt(3 + 2*sqrt(3 + 2*sqrt(3 + 2*sqrt(5)))) \u2248 sqrt(3 + 2*2.91) \u2248 sqrt(3 + 5.82) \u2248 sqrt(8.82) \u2248 2.97\n\nSo, it seems the sequence is increasing and approaching 3.\n\nMoreover, since each term is positive and increasing, and we've found that L = 3 is the only plausible limit, I can conclude that the limit is 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 3} \\]"
