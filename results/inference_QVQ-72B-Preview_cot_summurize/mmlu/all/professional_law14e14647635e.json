                    "text": "So I've got this question here about a congressional report and a new statute aimed at ensuring minorities have the right to vote. It's a bit confusing, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the background: There's a report saying that in some parts of the country, only 42% of eligible minorities are registered to vote. That seems really low, and it suggests there might be barriers preventing them from registering. The report also mentions residency laws that restrict voting rights. So, based on this, Congress passed a statute declaring that any law denying minorities the right to vote is unconstitutional.\n\nNow, the question is asking under which constitutional amendment this federal statute is most likely to be upheld. The options are the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, or Twentieth Amendments.\n\nLet me recall what each of these amendments is about.\n\nThe Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime. It doesn't directly address voting rights, so I'm not sure how it would apply here. Maybe indirectly, but it seems like a stretch.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment addresses citizenship and equal protection under the law. It includes the Equal Protection Clause, which requires states to provide equal protection of the laws to all people within their jurisdictions. This could be relevant to voting rights if the laws are being applied unequally based on race or other factors.\n\nThe Fifteenth Amendment specifically prohibits the federal government and each state from denying a citizen the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude. This seems directly related to the issue at hand\u2014ensuring that minorities have the right to vote without any denial based on their race.\n\nThe Twentieth Amendment deals with the terms of office for the President and Vice President and the meeting of Congress. It doesn't seem to have any direct connection to voting rights for minorities.\n\nGiven these explanations, it seems like the Fifteenth Amendment is the most directly relevant to the issue of voting rights for minorities. The statute in question is aimed at preventing any law that denies minorities the right to vote, which aligns perfectly with the Fifteenth Amendment's prohibition against denying the right to vote based on race.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another amendment that could also apply here.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause could be invoked if the laws are being applied in a discriminatory manner. However, the Fifteenth Amendment is more specific to voting rights based on race, so it would probably take precedence in this context.\n\nThe Thirteenth Amendment, while important for ending slavery, doesn't directly address voting rights beyond possibly providing a basis for arguments against discriminatory practices more generally.\n\nThe Twentieth Amendment is clearly not relevant to voting rights for minorities.\n\nTherefore, the most likely constitutional provision under which this federal statute would be upheld is the Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"deeming such laws unconstitutional.\" Doesn't the Fifteenth Amendment prohibit denying the right to vote based on race, but it's up to Congress to enforce it through appropriate legislation?\n\nActually, the Fifteenth Amendment does empower Congress to enforce it by law. So, Congress passing a statute to make such laws unconstitutional would be exercising its enforcement power under the Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be C. Fifteenth Amendment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
