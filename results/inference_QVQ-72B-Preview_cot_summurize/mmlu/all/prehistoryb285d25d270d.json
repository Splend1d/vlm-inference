Hmm, I need to recall some history about metalworking in South America.\n\nI remember that metalworking has a rich history in South America, especially in places like Peru and Bolivia, where ancient civilizations like the Incas and the Moche were known for their metal craftsmanship. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics of how they worked with metals.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. First, I need to consider what metalworking techniques were available to these early South American cultures. I know that some metalworking techniques require advanced technology, like smelting, which involves melting ores to extract metals. Did the early South Americans have the knowledge and technology to smelt metals?\n\nLet me consider smelting first. Smelting is a process that involves heating ores to a temperature where the metal melts and can be separated from the gangue or waste materials. It usually requires a controlled environment, like a furnace, and a source of fuel to reach high temperatures. For example, smelting copper ores typically requires temperatures around 1,200 degrees Celsius. Did the early South American metallurgists have the ability to achieve such high temperatures?\n\nI recall that the Incas were skilled metalworkers, but I think their primary methods involved cold working metals, like hammering and casting, rather than smelting. They were famous for their gold and silver artifacts, which were often shaped by hammering thin sheets of metal into desired forms. This suggests that hammering was a prominent technique used by them.\n\nWhat about casting? Casting involves pouring molten metal into a mold and allowing it to cool and solidify into a specific shape. This technique can be done without necessarily smelting ores, especially if the metal is being recycled or obtained through trade. I believe the Moche culture in Peru was particularly adept at lost-wax casting, which is a sophisticated casting technique.\n\nSo, if I'm correct, both hammering and casting were used by early South American metalworkers. But what about smelting? Did they practice smelting to extract metals from ores?\n\nI need to think about this carefully. Smelting requires complex equipment and a deep understanding of chemistry and temperatures. While it's possible that some smelting did occur in South America, I think it was less common than techniques like hammering and casting, especially in the earlier periods.\n\nLet me try to find some evidence to support this. I recall that the Andean region had abundant mineral resources, including copper, tin, and silver. These metals could be worked by various techniques, but smelting might have been more associated with specific cultures or time periods.\n\nFor instance, the Tiwanaku culture, which preceded the Incas, is known to have worked with metals, possibly using smelting techniques. But I'm not entirely sure about the extent of their smelting activities.\n\nOn the other hand, the Incas are well-documented as using metals extensively, particularly gold and silver, which they obtained through mining and then worked into intricate jewelry and ceremonial objects. However, these metals were often obtained in their native form, meaning they were found naturally in a pure state, requiring less processing than smelting ores.\n\nCopper, on the other hand, was sometimes alloyed with tin to make bronze, which was stronger and more suitable for tools and weapons. To make bronze, one would need to mix copper and tin, which might involve melting processes, but not necessarily smelting the ores themselves.\n\nWait a minute, smelting involves extracting metal from its ore, whereas melting is about turning the metal into a liquid form for casting or alloying. So, smelting is a specific step in metal production that involves separating the metal from its ore, usually by combining heat with a reducing agent to remove oxygen or other elements bound to the metal in the ore.\n\nGiven that, I need to distinguish between smelting, which is ore processing, and melting, which is working with already refined metal.\n\nIn South America, there is evidence of both smelting and casting, but I think casting was more widespread and occurred earlier than smelting. For example, the Moche culture was famous for their ceramic molds used in casting metals, suggesting that casting was a well-established technique.\n\nSimilarly, hammering was a common practice, as seen in the Incan goldsmiths who created thin, intricate objects by hammering metal sheets.\n\nNow, considering all this, I need to decide which of these techniques were used by the first metalworkers in South America.\n\nOption A is casting, which seems to have been widely used.\n\nOption B is hammering, which is also clearly documented.\n\nOption C is smelting, which might have been used, but perhaps not as early or as commonly as casting and hammering.\n\nOption D is all of the above, which would include smelting, casting, and hammering.\n\nGiven that casting and hammering were definitely used by early South American metalworkers, the question really boils down to whether smelting was also practiced in those early periods.\n\nI need to consider the timing. When did metalworking begin in South America, and what techniques were available at that time?\n\nMetalworking in South America dates back to at least 3000 BCE, with the discovery of copper artifacts in Chile and Peru. These early metals were likely worked by cold hammering, as smelting technology might not have been developed yet.\n\nCasting techniques seem to have developed later, around 1000 BCE, with the Moche culture being particularly renowned for their casting skills.\n\nSmelting, on the other hand, appears to have been developed in South America somewhat later, possibly around the first millennium CE. For example, the Wari culture, which flourished from around 500 to 1000 CE, is known to have practiced smelting.\n\nGiven this timeline, if the first metals in South America were worked around 3000 BCE, and smelting didn't appear until around 500 CE, it suggests that smelting was not part of the earliest metalworking techniques in the region.\n\nTherefore, while smelting was eventually practiced in South America, it wasn't one of the first methods used.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I would conclude that the first metals in South America were worked primarily through casting and hammering, not smelting.\n\nThat means the correct answer should be D. all of the above, but only if smelting was indeed used from the very beginning, which seems not to be the case.\n\nAlternatively, if smelting was not part of the earliest metalworking practices, then perhaps the answer should exclude smelting.\n\nWait, but the question is specifically about the first metals worked in South America, not about the entire history of metalworking in the region.\n\nGiven that, and considering that smelting seems to have been developed later, it's probably safe to say that smelting was not part of the initial methods used.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be either A. casting or B. hammering, or perhaps both.\n\nBut since both casting and hammering were used early on, and smelting came later, the most accurate answer would be D. all of the above, but with the understanding that smelting was not part of the very first metalworking techniques.\n\nHowever, since the question specifies \"the first metals worked,\" I think it's best to exclude smelting, as it was a later development.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. all of the above, but with the clarification that smelting was not part of the earliest metalworking practices.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the question is simply asking about the methods used in early metalworking in South America, without specifying the exact timing.\n\nIn that case, if smelting was eventually used, it could be included.\n\nBut to be precise, given that smelting was not part of the earliest metalworking techniques, it's more accurate to say that casting and hammering were the first methods used.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. all of the above, but recognizing that smelting was not initially employed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to test knowledge about the specific techniques used in South America, and whether smelting was indeed practiced there.\n\nIn that case, since smelting was eventually practiced in South America, the answer could be D. all of the above.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider the context of the question. If it's about the first metals worked, meaning the earliest stages of metalworking in South America, then smelting was not part of those early techniques.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer would be to select the options that include casting and hammering but exclude smelting.\n\nThat would mean selecting A. casting and B. hammering, but not C. smelting.\n\nBut since the question provides D. all of the above as an option, and smelting was not part of the earliest metalworking, I should choose D. all of the above with the understanding that smelting was a later development.\n\nHowever, given that the question specifies \"the first metals worked,\" and smelting was not part of those early efforts, it's probably best to exclude smelting from the answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. all of the above, but with the recognition that smelting was not initially used.\n\nBut perhaps the question is considering smelting as a method that was eventually used in South America, and thus including it under \"all of the above.\"\n\nIn that case, if smelting was used at any point in South American metalworking history, then D. all of the above would be correct.\n\nHowever, to be precise about the earliest methods, I think it's more accurate to exclude smelting.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with D. all of the above, acknowledging that smelting was not part of the very first metalworking techniques but was used later on.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
