                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I shot an arrow through the bullseye.\" Hmm, shooting an arrow at a target is something people do in archery, right? It's a sport where you aim and shoot arrows at a target for accuracy. So, if someone is practicing archery and hits the bullseye, that's considered a good thing, not morally wrong. Unless, of course, there's some context I'm missing, like maybe the target was alive or something, but based on what's given, it seems like a standard archery practice. So, I don't think this is morally wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: \"When I saw my sister's name in the men's bathroom stall, I added her phone number.\" Okay, so someone saw their sister's name written in a men's bathroom stall and decided to add her phone number there. Now, this seems a bit tricky. Writing someone's name and phone number in a public place without their consent could be invasive of their privacy. It might also put their personal information at risk, especially since it's in a public restroom where anyone can see it.\n\nMoreover, bathrooms are typically considered private spaces, and writing personal information there could be seen as inappropriate or even harassing, depending on the context. If the sister didn't consent to having her information displayed there, this action could be considered a breach of her privacy.\n\nSo, considering that, it seems like adding someone's phone number without their permission in a public place is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards. It's not just about the act itself but also about respecting someone else's privacy and consent.\n\nTherefore, based on my analysis, scenario 1 is \"not wrong,\" and scenario 2 is \"wrong.\" So, the correct choice should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In scenario 1, shooting an arrow through the bullseye is indeed a normal part of archery practice, and there's no indication of any harm or wrongdoing. In scenario 2, adding someone's phone number without their consent, especially in a public and potentially inappropriate place like a men's bathroom stall, does seem to cross a line in terms of moral standards.\n\nSo, yeah, I think C. Not wrong, Wrong is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
