                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about a cannonball being fired horizontally at 10 m/s from a cliff, and I need to find its speed one second after being fired. The options are 10 m/s, 14 m/s, 16 m/s, and 20 m/s. Hmm, I think this has something to do with projectile motion. I remember that in projectile motion, the horizontal and vertical components of the motion are independent, right?\n\nSo, initially, the cannonball has a horizontal velocity of 10 m/s. Since it's fired horizontally, there's no initial vertical velocity. But after it's been falling for one second, gravity has pulled it downward, adding a vertical component to its velocity. So, after one second, the vertical velocity due to gravity should be something like 9.8 m/s downward, because acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2, and velocity is acceleration times time.\n\nSo, vertical velocity after one second is 9.8 m/s down, and horizontal velocity remains 10 m/s. To find the total speed, I should combine these two components using the Pythagorean theorem, since they're perpendicular to each other.\n\nLet me sketch this out. Horizontal velocity is 10 m/s, vertical velocity is 9.8 m/s. The total speed, v, should be the square root of (horizontal velocity squared plus vertical velocity squared). So, v = \u221a(10\u00b2 + 9.8\u00b2) = \u221a(100 + 96.04) = \u221a196.04.\n\nCalculating the square root of 196.04: well, 14 squared is 196, and 14.001 squared would be roughly 196.028, so about 14.001 m/s. But looking at the options, 14 m/s is one of them, but I wonder if it's exact enough.\n\nWait, maybe I should be more precise. Gravity is approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2, so after one second, vertical velocity is 9.81 m/s. Then, v = \u221a(10\u00b2 + 9.81\u00b2) = \u221a(100 + 96.2161) = \u221a196.2161. The square root of that is approximately 14.007 m/s. So, rounded to the nearest whole number, that's 14 m/s.\n\nBut wait, the options include 14 m/s, 16 m/s, etc. Maybe I need to consider if there's any other factor affecting the speed. For example, air resistance or something, but the problem doesn't mention any resistance, so I assume it's in a vacuum or negligible air resistance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the direction or something, but since it's asking for speed, which is a scalar, just the magnitude of the velocity vector, combining the components should suffice.\n\nLet me double-check. After one second, horizontal velocity is still 10 m/s, and vertical velocity is 9.8 m/s due to gravity. So, the resultant speed should indeed be the square root of (10\u00b2 + 9.8\u00b2), which is about 14 m/s.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 10 m/s\n\nB. 14 m/s\n\nC. 16 m/s\n\nD. 20 m/s\n\nIt seems like 14 m/s is the closest answer. Maybe to be thorough, I can calculate it more precisely.\n\nLet's use 9.81 m/s for gravity:\n\nv = \u221a(10\u00b2 + (9.81)\u00b2) = \u221a(100 + 96.2161) = \u221a196.2161 \u2248 14.007 m/s.\n\nSo, 14 m/s is the best answer among the given options.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that after one second, the vertical velocity is exactly 9.8 m/s, then v = \u221a(10\u00b2 + 9.8\u00b2) = \u221a(100 + 96.04) = \u221a196.04 \u2248 14.001 m/s, still very close to 14 m/s.\n\nI don't think it's 16 m/s or 20 m/s, unless there's some other factor I'm missing, like perhaps the cannonball has an initial vertical component, but no, the problem says it's fired horizontally, so initial vertical velocity is zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. 14 m/s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 14 \\ \\text{m/s}} \\]"
