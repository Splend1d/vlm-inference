                    "text": "Let's tackle this thermodynamics problem. So, we have a reaction that's nonspontaneous under standard conditions but becomes spontaneous at higher temperatures. We need to figure out which of the given options correctly describes the signs of \u0394H (enthalpy change), \u0394S (entropy change), and \u0394G (Gibbs free energy) under standard conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what makes a reaction spontaneous. A spontaneous reaction is one that proceeds on its own without any external input of energy. The criterion for spontaneity is determined by the change in Gibbs free energy (\u0394G), which is a combination of enthalpy (\u0394H) and entropy (\u0394S) changes.\n\nThe formula for \u0394G is:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \u0394G is the change in Gibbs free energy\n\n- \u0394H is the change in enthalpy\n\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin\n\n- \u0394S is the change in entropy\n\nUnder standard conditions, T is usually 298 K.\n\nA reaction is:\n\n- Spontaneous when \u0394G < 0\n\n- Nonspontaneous when \u0394G > 0\n\n- At equilibrium when \u0394G = 0\n\nGiven that the reaction is nonspontaneous under standard conditions, we know that \u0394G > 0.\n\nNow, the problem states that the reaction becomes spontaneous at higher temperatures. That means at higher temperatures, \u0394G < 0.\n\nSo, under standard conditions:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta G > 0 \\implies \\Delta H - T \\Delta S > 0\n\\]\n\nAnd at higher temperatures:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta G < 0 \\implies \\Delta H - T \\Delta S < 0\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the signs of \u0394H and \u0394S that make this possible.\n\nLet's consider the signs of \u0394H and \u0394S:\n\n1. If \u0394H < 0 (exothermic) and \u0394S > 0 (increase in entropy):\n\nIn this case, both terms \u0394H and T\u0394S are negative and positive, respectively. Since \u0394H is negative and T\u0394S is positive, the sign of \u0394G depends on the balance between them.\n\nAt standard conditions (T=298 K), if \u0394H is sufficiently negative and T\u0394S is positive but not large enough to overcome \u0394H, \u0394G could be negative. But the problem states that the reaction is nonspontaneous under standard conditions, meaning \u0394G > 0.\n\nSo, if \u0394H < 0 and \u0394S > 0, it's possible for \u0394G to be positive at low temperatures (like standard conditions) and negative at higher temperatures.\n\nWait, but option A says \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G = 0. That doesn't match what we just thought.\n\nOption C says \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G > 0.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nIf \u0394H < 0 and \u0394S < 0, then:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S\n\\]\n\nAt standard conditions, T=298 K, \u0394H is negative, T\u0394S is negative (since \u0394S is negative), so \u0394G = negative - negative = possibly negative or positive, depending on the magnitudes.\n\nBut the problem states that under standard conditions, \u0394G > 0, so the reaction is nonspontaneous.\n\nSo, if \u0394H < 0 and \u0394S < 0, \u0394G could be positive if the negative T\u0394S is larger in magnitude than \u0394H.\n\nSimilarly, at higher temperatures, as T increases, T\u0394S becomes more negative, which would make \u0394G decrease further, possibly turning negative.\n\nBut in this case, if \u0394H < 0 and \u0394S < 0, at standard conditions, \u0394G could be positive, and at higher temperatures, it could become negative, which aligns with the problem statement.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option C is \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G > 0, which matches our current understanding.\n\nHowever, option A has \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G = 0, which doesn't match because under standard conditions, \u0394G > 0, not equal to zero.\n\nSo, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B: \u0394H > 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G > 0.\n\nIf \u0394H > 0 and \u0394S < 0:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S\n\\]\n\n\u0394H is positive, T\u0394S is negative (since \u0394S is negative), so \u0394G = positive - negative = positive + positive = positive, which is greater than zero, so \u0394G > 0 under standard conditions.\n\nAt higher temperatures, T increases, making T\u0394S more negative, so \u0394G increases further, meaning it becomes even more positive, and thus remains nonspontaneous.\n\nBut the problem states that the reaction becomes spontaneous at higher temperatures, which would require \u0394G to decrease and become negative at higher T.\n\nSo, if \u0394H > 0 and \u0394S < 0, \u0394G increases with increasing T, remaining positive, which contradicts the problem's statement.\n\nTherefore, option B is incorrect.\n\nOption D: \u0394H > 0, \u0394S > 0, and \u0394G > 0.\n\nIf \u0394H > 0 and \u0394S > 0:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S\n\\]\n\n\u0394H is positive, T\u0394S is positive, so \u0394G = positive - positive = could be positive or negative, depending on the relative magnitudes.\n\nAt standard conditions, \u0394G > 0, meaning \u0394H > T\u0394S.\n\nAt higher temperatures, as T increases, T\u0394S increases, which reduces \u0394G, potentially making it negative.\n\nSo, if \u0394H > 0 and \u0394S > 0, the reaction could be nonspontaneous under standard conditions (\u0394G > 0) and spontaneous at higher temperatures (\u0394G < 0), which matches the problem's description.\n\nTherefore, option D seems plausible.\n\nBut wait, option C also seems possible.\n\nOption C: \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G > 0.\n\nIf \u0394H < 0 and \u0394S < 0:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S\n\\]\n\n\u0394H is negative, T\u0394S is negative, so \u0394G = negative - negative = negative + positive.\n\nWait, no: \u0394H is negative, T\u0394S is negative (since \u0394S is negative), so \u0394G = negative - negative = negative + positive.\n\nIf the negative \u0394H is larger in magnitude than the positive T\u0394S, \u0394G can be positive under standard conditions.\n\nAt higher temperatures, T\u0394S becomes more negative, which would make \u0394G decrease, potentially turning negative.\n\nSo, option C also fits the description.\n\nOption A has \u0394G = 0, which is not the case under standard conditions, as per the problem.\n\nOption B leads to \u0394G increasing with T, remaining positive, which contradicts the problem's statement.\n\nOption D has \u0394H > 0 and \u0394S > 0, which can lead to \u0394G > 0 under standard conditions and \u0394G < 0 at higher temperatures.\n\nOption C has \u0394H < 0 and \u0394S < 0, which can also lead to \u0394G > 0 under standard conditions and \u0394G < 0 at higher temperatures.\n\nSo, both options C and D seem possible.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nConsider option D: \u0394H > 0 and \u0394S > 0.\n\nAt standard conditions (T=298 K), \u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S.\n\nSince \u0394H > 0 and \u0394S > 0, \u0394G > 0 if \u0394H > T\u0394S.\n\nAt higher temperatures, T\u0394S increases, so \u0394G decreases, potentially becoming negative.\n\nSimilarly, for option C: \u0394H < 0 and \u0394S < 0.\n\n\u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S.\n\nSince \u0394H is negative and \u0394S is negative, T\u0394S is negative, so \u0394G = negative - negative = negative + positive.\n\nIf the positive T\u0394S is larger than the negative \u0394H, \u0394G can be positive under standard conditions.\n\nAt higher temperatures, T\u0394S becomes more negative, making \u0394G decrease, potentially becoming negative.\n\nSo, both options C and D seem to fit the description.\n\nBut the problem asks for the conclusions that may be drawn under standard conditions, and among the options, only one should be correct.\n\nPerhaps I'm missing something.\n\nLet me consider the relationship between \u0394H, \u0394S, and \u0394G again.\n\nGiven that the reaction is nonspontaneous under standard conditions, \u0394G > 0.\n\nIt becomes spontaneous at higher temperatures, meaning \u0394G < 0 at higher T.\n\nSo, \u0394G must change sign from positive to negative as temperature increases.\n\nThis implies that \u0394G is a decreasing function of temperature.\n\nFrom the equation \u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S, taking the derivative with respect to T:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d(\\Delta G)}{dT} = -\\Delta S\n\\]\n\nFor \u0394G to decrease with increasing T, \u0394S must be positive (since -\u0394S would be negative, indicating a decrease in \u0394G).\n\nTherefore, \u0394S > 0 is required for \u0394G to decrease with increasing T.\n\nThis aligns with option D: \u0394H > 0, \u0394S > 0, and \u0394G > 0 under standard conditions.\n\nIn this case, at standard conditions, \u0394G > 0 (nonspontaneous), and as T increases, \u0394G decreases, potentially becoming negative (spontaneous).\n\nOption C has \u0394S < 0, which would make \u0394G increase with increasing T, which contradicts the problem's statement that the reaction becomes spontaneous at higher temperatures.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if \u0394S < 0, \u0394G would increase with increasing T, making it even less spontaneous, which doesn't match the problem's description.\n\nTherefore, option C is incorrect because it predicts that \u0394G would increase with increasing T, remaining nonspontaneous, contrary to the problem's statement.\n\nHence, option D is the correct choice.\n\nSo, the correct conclusions under standard conditions are:\n\n\u0394H > 0, \u0394S > 0, and \u0394G > 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
