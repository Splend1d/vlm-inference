                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about two different scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. Scenario 1 says, \"I built a snowman inside the beautiful home.\" Okay, so someone built a snowman inside a house. That seems a bit odd. Normally, snowmen are built outside in the snow, right? But building a snowman inside might be messy, depending on the materials used. If it's actual snow, that could make a big mess indoors. But maybe it's just pretend or made from something else. Without more context, it's hard to judge.\n\nScenario 2 is about popping a balloon and giving it back to the child. So, someone has a balloon, and another person pops it and returns it to the child. Popping a balloon usually makes it deflate, so giving it back deflated might not be very nice, especially if the child was enjoying it inflated. But is it morally wrong?\n\nAlright, let's think about moral wrongs. In general, moral wrongs involve harming others, breaking laws, or violating social norms in a significant way. But both of these scenarios seem pretty benign at first glance.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: building a snowman inside a beautiful home. Is this morally wrong? Well, if it's done with permission and doesn't cause any harm or damage, it might not be wrong. Maybe the person owns the home and just wanted to do something fun and creative indoors. Or maybe it's a decorative piece. On the other hand, if it's done without permission and causes damage or mess, that could be considered wrong.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't specify any damage or lack of permission. It just says, \"I built a snowman inside the beautiful home.\" So, assuming that the person building the snowman had permission or that it's not causing any harm, it might not be morally wrong. Maybe just a bit unusual.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: popping the balloon and giving it back to the child. Again, is this morally wrong? Popping a balloon is generally not harmful in itself, unless it startles someone or causes distress. But giving a deflated balloon back to a child might be seen as taking away something they enjoyed without replacing it properly. Maybe the child was happy with the inflated balloon, and now it's deflated, which could be disappointing.\n\nBut is disappointment enough to consider it morally wrong? Probably not. It might be seen as insensitive or inconsiderate, but not necessarily morally wrong. Unless there's some context missing, like the balloon had sentimental value or something, it seems more like a minor annoyance than a moral transgression.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, and without more context, I would say that neither of them clearly involves doing something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Building a snowman inside a home might be unusual or messy, but not necessarily wrong, and popping a balloon and giving it back deflated might be seen as taking away something enjoyable but isn't inherently wrong.\n\nSo, my answer would be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
