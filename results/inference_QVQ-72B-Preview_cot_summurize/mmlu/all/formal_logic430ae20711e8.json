It's a bit dense, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the argument starts by mentioning that there are people who use predicate variables, and the values of these variables are attributes. So, it's talking about how in logic, we can have variables that stand for predicates, and these predicates represent attributes of things.\n\nNext, it says that predicates are wanted in all sentences, regardless of whether there are attributes to refer to. This seems to suggest that even if we don't have specific attributes in mind, using predicates is still necessary in logical sentences.\n\nThen, there's a mention of a \"dummy\" predicate 'F' that's generally wanted for expository purposes. I think this means that sometimes, people use a placeholder predicate like 'F' to explain things more clearly or to make examples easier to understand.\n\nFinally, the argument concludes that if we're going to quantify over attributes and refer to them, then clarity is served by using recognizable variables and distinctive names for these purposes, and not mixing them up with the predicates.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Predicate variables are used, and their values are attributes.\n\n- Predicates are necessary in all sentences, even without specific attributes.\n\n- A dummy predicate 'F' is used for explanation.\n\n- Clarity is achieved by using clear variables and names when quantifying over attributes and not mixing them with predicates.\n\nNow, I need to identify which of these points is the conclusion. The conclusion should be the main point or the assertion that the argument is building up to.\n\nOption A: There are those who use predicate variables; the values of these variables are attributes.\n\nThis seems more like a premise or a background fact about how some people approach logic. It's introducing the concept of predicate variables and their values being attributes.\n\nOption B: Predicates are wanted in all sentences regardless of whether there are attributes to refer to.\n\nThis might be another premise, emphasizing the importance of predicates in logical sentences, even when specific attributes aren't being referred to.\n\nOption C: The dummy predicate 'F' is wanted generally for expository purposes.\n\nThis seems to be explaining why a dummy predicate like 'F' is used\u2014primarily for making explanations clearer or simpler. It's more of a side point rather than the main conclusion.\n\nOption D: If we are going to quantify over attributes and refer to them, then clarity is served by using recognizable variables and distinctive names for the purposes, and not mixing these up with the predicates.\n\nThis seems like the main takeaway. It's suggesting that when we want to talk about attributes generally (through quantification), using clear and distinct variables and names helps maintain clarity, and we should avoid confusing them with the predicates themselves.\n\nGiven this structure, it appears that option D is the conclusion. The earlier points set the stage by introducing predicate variables, emphasizing the role of predicates in sentences, and mentioning the use of dummy predicates for explanation. Then, the conclusion ties these together by recommending a practice for maintaining clarity when quantifying over attributes.\n\nSo, my answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
