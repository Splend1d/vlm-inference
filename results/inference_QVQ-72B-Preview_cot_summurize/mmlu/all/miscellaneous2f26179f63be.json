Espy.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these awards is related to sports.\n\nFirst, let's think about the Oscar. I know that the Oscar is an award given by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. It's for achievements in the film industry, like best actor, best director, that kind of thing. So, it's related to movies, not sports. So, probably not the right choice.\n\nNext, the Emmy. I believe the Emmy is similar to the Oscar but for television. It's given for excellence in TV programming and performances. So, again, this seems to be more about entertainment and not specifically about sports. Maybe some sports shows or documentaries could win an Emmy, but it's not an award that's solely dedicated to sports.\n\nThen there's the Nobel Prize. I know the Nobel Prize is a highly prestigious award given in several categories: physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, peace, and economics. These are all academic and scientific fields, nothing directly related to sports. So, I can cross that one off too.\n\nThat leaves me with the Espy. I'm not as familiar with this one. Let me think... I think the Espy is an award that's related to sports. I recall seeing something about the Espy Awards on TV, maybe during the summer, where they celebrate athletes and sports achievements. Yeah, that sounds right. So, unlike the other awards which are for films, television, or academic achievements, the Espy is focused on sports.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check my understanding. The Oscar is for films, the Emmy for television, the Nobel for academic and scientific contributions, and the Espy for sports. So, based on this, the Espy is the correct choice for a sports award.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that one of the other awards could somehow be related to sports indirectly? For example, maybe a film about a sports team winning an Oscar, or a television show about athletes winning an Emmy. But that would still be categorizing them under film and television awards, not specifically sports awards. The Nobel Prizes are entirely different, and there's no sports category there.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident with my answer. The Espy is the sports award among these options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Espy}} \\]"
