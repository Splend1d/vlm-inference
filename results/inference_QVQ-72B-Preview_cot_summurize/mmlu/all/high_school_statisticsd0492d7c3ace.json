                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a filling machine that puts an average of four ounces of coffee in jars, with a standard deviation of 0.25 ounces. I'm supposed to find the probability that the mean amount per jar in a random sample of forty jars is less than 3.9 ounces. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that the filling machine has a mean fill of 4 ounces per jar, and the standard deviation is 0.25 ounces. So, most jars are filled around 4 ounces, give or take 0.25 ounces. Now, I have a sample of 40 jars, and I need to find the probability that the average fill in these jars is less than 3.9 ounces.\n\nI remember from statistics that when you take samples from a population, the means of those samples follow a normal distribution, especially if the sample size is large enough. The central limit theorem, I think it's called. Even if the original population isn't normally distributed, the sample means will be approximately normal if the sample size is large enough.\n\nIn this case, the sample size is 40, which should be large enough for the central limit theorem to apply. So, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal with the same mean as the population and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n\nSo, the mean of the sampling distribution is still 4 ounces, and the standard deviation (also called the standard error) is 0.25 divided by the square root of 40.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nStandard error (SE) = \u03c3 / \u221an = 0.25 / \u221a40\n\nFirst, find the square root of 40. 40 is 4 squared is 16, and 5 squared is 25, so it's between 6 and 7. Let me use a calculator for this.\n\n\u221a40 is approximately 6.3247.\n\nSo, SE = 0.25 / 6.3247 \u2248 0.0395 ounces.\n\nOkay, so the sampling distribution has a mean of 4 ounces and a standard deviation of about 0.0395 ounces.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability that the sample mean is less than 3.9 ounces. To find this probability, I can standardize the value by calculating the z-score.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (x\u0304 - \u03bc) / (\u03c3 / \u221an)\n\nWhere:\n\n- x\u0304 is the sample mean\n\n- \u03bc is the population mean\n\n- \u03c3 is the population standard deviation\n\n- n is the sample size\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nz = (3.9 - 4) / (0.25 / \u221a40) = (-0.1) / 0.0395 \u2248 -2.53\n\nSo, the z-score is approximately -2.53.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability that the z-score is less than -2.53. I can look this up in a standard normal distribution table.\n\nLooking up the z-table, a z-score of -2.53 corresponds to a cumulative probability of approximately 0.0057.\n\nWait, but let's double-check that. The z-table gives the area to the left of the z-score, which is the cumulative probability up to that z-score.\n\nSo, for z = -2.53, the table should show the probability of being less than that value.\n\nYes, according to standard z-tables, z = -2.53 corresponds to 0.0057.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the mean amount per jar filled in the sampled jars is less than 3.9 ounces is approximately 0.0057.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.0057\n\nB. 0.0225\n\nC. 0.025\n\nD. 0.05\n\nSo, option A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if the data is normally distributed or not. The problem says the machine fills an average of four ounces with a standard deviation of 0.25 ounces, but doesn't specify the distribution. However, since the sample size is large (n=40), the central limit theorem should apply, and the sampling distribution should be approximately normal, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nTherefore, I think my calculation is correct, and the answer should be A. 0.0057.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should think about another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I could use the t-distribution since the population standard deviation is known, but with a large sample size like 40, the t-distribution and the standard normal distribution are very similar, so the difference in the z-score would be negligible.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider using the t-distribution.\n\nThe t-score formula is similar to the z-score:\n\nt = (x\u0304 - \u03bc) / (s / \u221an)\n\nWhere s is the sample standard deviation. However, in this problem, we are given the population standard deviation, so it's appropriate to use the z-distribution.\n\nMoreover, with a sample size of 40, the t-distribution would be very close to the standard normal distribution.\n\nSo, I think sticking with the z-distribution is acceptable here.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the probability is approximately 0.0057, which corresponds to option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 0.0057} \\]"
