                    "text": "So I have this question here about X-linked inheritance. It's asking which of the following disorders does not show X-linked inheritance. The options are Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Tay-Sachs disease, Haemophilia A, and Haemophilia B. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I need to remember what X-linked inheritance means. Since the X chromosome is one of the sex chromosomes, X-linked traits are passed down through the X chromosome. Typically, males have one X and one Y chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes. So, for X-linked recessive disorders, males are more commonly affected because they only need one copy of the mutated gene on their single X chromosome. Females would need two copies, one on each X chromosome, to be affected, which is less common.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Duchenne muscular dystrophy\n\nI know that Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a muscle-wasting disease. From my genetics class, I recall that DMD is an X-linked recessive disorder. So, it's passed down through the X chromosome, and boys are typically more affected than girls. So, this should be X-linked.\n\nB. Tay-Sachs disease\n\nTay-Sachs disease is another genetic disorder. I think it's related to lipid metabolism in the brain. Let me see, is this X-linked? I don't think so. I believe Tay-Sachs is an autosomal recessive disorder. That means it's not linked to the sex chromosomes but to one of the other chromosomes. So, unlike X-linked disorders, both males and females are equally likely to be affected, and you need two copies of the mutated gene to have the disease.\n\nC. Haemophilia A\n\nHaemophilia A is a bleeding disorder. I know that hemophilia is often associated with the royal families of Europe, and it's typically an X-linked recessive trait. So, again, it's passed through the X chromosome, with males being more commonly affected.\n\nD. Haemophilia B\n\nHaemophilia B is another form of hemophilia. I believe it's also X-linked recessive, similar to Haemophilia A. So, same story here.\n\nFrom this, it seems like all of these disorders except Tay-Sachs disease are X-linked recessive. Tay-Sachs is autosomal recessive, meaning it's not on the X chromosome.\n\nJust to make sure, I should double-check my understanding. Let me think about the inheritance patterns again.\n\n- X-linked recessive: Males need only one mutated gene on their X chromosome to be affected, while females need two copies (one on each X chromosome) to be affected, although they can be carriers with one mutated gene.\n\n- Autosomal recessive: Both males and females are equally likely to be affected if both parents carry the mutated gene.\n\nGiven this, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Haemophilia A, and Haemophilia B are all X-linked recessive disorders, whereas Tay-Sachs disease is autosomal recessive.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Tay-Sachs disease.\n\nWait a minute, just to be thorough, I should confirm if there's any chance that Tay-Sachs could have an X-linked form or something. But no, I'm pretty confident that Tay-Sachs is autosomal recessive.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it. The answer is B. Tay-Sachs disease.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
