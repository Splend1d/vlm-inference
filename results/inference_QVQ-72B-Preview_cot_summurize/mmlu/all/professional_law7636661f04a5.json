                    "text": "So I've got this property law problem here, and I need to figure out who owns the property between the brother and the grantor's children. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grantor conveyed his property to his brother for life, and then to the heirs of his brother, for a consideration of one dollar. The brother accepted the deed but didn't record it. Later, the grantor conveyed the property in fee simple absolute to his two sons as a gift, and they recorded the deed. The brother found out that the sons were about to take possession and quickly recorded his deed. Now, there's a dispute over who owns the property.\n\nThe question is asking why the brother would prevail in this dispute. The options are:\n\nA. The brother paid valuable consideration for his deed.\n\nB. The brother recorded his deed before the grantor's children sought to oust him from the land.\n\nC. The grantor's sons are not protected by the recording statute.\n\nD. The grantor's knowledge is imputed to his children.\n\nAlright, let's analyze each option.\n\nOption A: The brother paid valuable consideration for his deed.\n\nWell, the deed was conveyed for one dollar, which seems like a nominal consideration. Typically, in property law, a nominal consideration can still be valid as it shows intent to transfer the property. However, the value isn't really the issue here; it's more about whether the consideration was present at all. But I'm not sure if this is the main reason the brother would prevail.\n\nOption B: The brother recorded his deed before the grantor's children sought to oust him from the land.\n\nYes, the brother recorded his deed after the sons had already recorded theirs but before they took possession. The recording statutes generally protect the first to record, provided they didn't have notice of prior unrecorded interests. But in this case, the sons recorded first, so I'm not sure if the brother recording later helps him.\n\nOption C: The grantor's sons are not protected by the recording statute.\n\nThe recording statute says that unrecorded instruments are void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice. The grantor's sons received the property as a gift, so did they pay value? Gift implies no consideration was paid. So, perhaps they didn't pay value, which might affect their protection under the recording statute.\n\nWait, but the statute says \"who paid value and without notice.\" If they didn't pay value, does that mean they're not protected? Maybe, but I need to think carefully.\n\nOption D: The grantor's knowledge is imputed to his children.\n\nThis seems interesting. If the grantor knew about the brother's deed, and since the sons are his children, perhaps his knowledge is imputed to them. But I'm not sure how that works in this context. Maybe the sons had knowledge of the brother's deed, which would affect their status as bona fide purchasers.\n\nLet me try to recall some principles of property law regarding recording statutes.\n\nGenerally, recording statutes are designed to protect subsequent purchasers who act in good faith and without notice of prior unrecorded interests. There are different types of recording statutes, such as race-notice, race, and notice statutes.\n\nIn a race-notice statute, a subsequent purchaser who records first without knowledge of prior unrecorded interests gets priority.\n\nIn a race statute, the first to record gets priority, regardless of notice.\n\nIn a notice statute, a subsequent purchaser who records without notice of prior unrecorded interests gets priority.\n\nI need to know which type of statute is in effect in this jurisdiction. The problem says, \"unless recorded, all written instruments affecting title to land are void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice.\"\n\nThis sounds like a notice statute because it protects subsequent purchasers who record without notice of prior unrecorded interests.\n\nSo, in this case, the grantor's sons recorded their deed first, and they claim to be subsequent purchasers without notice of the brother's deed.\n\nBut the problem states that the brother recorded his deed after the sons recorded theirs but before they took possession.\n\nNow, the question is whether the sons had notice of the brother's interest before they recorded their deed.\n\nIf they had notice, then their recording wouldn't protect them against the brother's unrecorded interest.\n\nBut if they didn't have notice, then their recording would protect them against the brother's unrecorded interest.\n\nThe problem mentions that the grantor conveyed the property to his sons as a gift, and they recorded the deed. Since it was a gift, they likely didn't pay value for it.\n\nBack to the recording statute: it says \"who paid value and without notice.\" So, if the sons didn't pay value, does that mean they're not protected by the recording statute?\n\nI think so. In many jurisdictions, the protection under recording statutes is extended only to those who paid value.\n\nTherefore, the grantor's sons, having received the property as a gift, did not pay value, and thus may not be protected by the recording statute.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother paid a nominal consideration of one dollar, which might be considered some form of value, although it's minimal.\n\nBut more importantly, the brother had a prior deed that, although not recorded, might still be valid against the grantor's sons because they didn't pay value.\n\nSo, perhaps the brother's deed is valid against the sons because they didn't pay value and therefore aren't protected by the recording statute.\n\nThat would mean that the brother's interest prevails over the sons' interest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: the grantor's sons are not protected by the recording statute because they didn't pay value.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIf the recording statute protects subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice, and the sons didn't pay value, then they're not protected.\n\nTherefore, the brother's unrecorded deed would still be valid against them.\n\nMoreover, the brother recorded his deed after the sons did, but since the sons weren't protected by the recording statute because they didn't pay value, the brother's late recording might still be effective.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the brother's recording is irrelevant because the sons recorded first, but given that the sons didn't pay value, their recording doesn't protect them against the brother's prior unrecorded interest.\n\nSo, it seems that the brother's interest prevails because the sons didn't pay value and thus aren't protected by the recording statute.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
