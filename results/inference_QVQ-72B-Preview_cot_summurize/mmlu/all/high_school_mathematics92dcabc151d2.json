                    "text": "So I have this problem here: find the greatest common divisor of \\(2^{1001} - 1\\) and \\(2^{1012} - 1\\). The options are 1, 2049, 2048, and 2047. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that for any positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), where \\(a < b\\), the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) can be found using the Euclidean algorithm. But in this case, both numbers are of the form \\(2^n - 1\\), which makes me think there might be a smarter way to approach this.\n\nI recall that for numbers of the form \\(2^n - 1\\), they are called Mersenne numbers, and they have some special properties. One property that comes to mind is that if \\(n\\) divides \\(m\\), then \\(2^n - 1\\) divides \\(2^m - 1\\). Let me verify that.\n\nSuppose \\(n\\) divides \\(m\\), so \\(m = k \\cdot n\\) for some integer \\(k\\). Then, \\(2^m - 1 = 2^{k \\cdot n} - 1 = (2^n)^k - 1\\). This can be factored using the formula for the difference of squares multiple times:\n\n\\[\n(2^n)^k - 1 = (2^n - 1)((2^n)^{k-1} + (2^n)^{k-2} + \\dots + 2^n + 1)\n\\]\n\nSo, indeed, \\(2^n - 1\\) divides \\(2^m - 1\\) when \\(n\\) divides \\(m\\). That's useful.\n\nIn this problem, we have \\(2^{1001} - 1\\) and \\(2^{1012} - 1\\). Let's see if 1001 divides 1012 or vice versa. 1012 divided by 1001 is 1 with a remainder of 11, since \\(1001 \\times 1 = 1001\\), and \\(1012 - 1001 = 11\\). So, 1001 does not divide 1012, and 1012 does not divide 1001. Therefore, we can't directly apply that property here.\n\nMaybe I can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of these two numbers. The Euclidean algorithm states that \\(\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a \\mod b)\\). So, if I let \\(a = 2^{1012} - 1\\) and \\(b = 2^{1001} - 1\\), then \\(\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a \\mod b)\\).\n\nBut calculating \\(a \\mod b\\) for numbers this large seems impractical. There must be a better way.\n\nWait a minute, I remember another property related to the GCD of numbers of the form \\(2^n - 1\\). Specifically, \\(\\gcd(2^n - 1, 2^m - 1) = 2^{\\gcd(n,m)} - 1\\). Is that right?\n\nLet me test this with small values. Suppose \\(n = 2\\) and \\(m = 4\\). Then, \\(2^2 - 1 = 3\\) and \\(2^4 - 1 = 15\\). The GCD of 3 and 15 is 3, and \\(\\gcd(2,4) = 2\\), and \\(2^2 - 1 = 3\\). So, it holds in this case.\n\nLet me try another one: \\(n = 3\\), \\(m = 5\\). \\(2^3 - 1 = 7\\), \\(2^5 - 1 = 31\\). GCD of 7 and 31 is 1, and \\(\\gcd(3,5) = 1\\), and \\(2^1 - 1 = 1\\). That also holds.\n\nOkay, so if this property is true in general, then \\(\\gcd(2^{1001} - 1, 2^{1012} - 1) = 2^{\\gcd(1001, 1012)} - 1\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find \\(\\gcd(1001, 1012)\\).\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm for integers:\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(1001, 1012) = \\gcd(1012, 1001 \\mod 1012)\n\\]\n\n1001 divided by 1012 is 0 with a remainder of 1001, since 1012 \u00d7 0 + 1001 = 1001.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me correct that.\n\nActually, 1012 divided by 1001 is 1 with a remainder of 11, because 1001 \u00d7 1 = 1001, and 1012 - 1001 = 11.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(1001, 1012) = \\gcd(1001, 11)\n\\]\n\nNow, check if 11 divides 1001.\n\n11 \u00d7 91 = 1001. Yes, 11 divides 1001 exactly 91 times.\n\nSo, \\(\\gcd(1001, 11) = 11\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(\\gcd(2^{1001} - 1, 2^{1012} - 1) = 2^{11} - 1 = 2048 - 1 = 2047\\).\n\nLooking back at the options, 2047 is one of them.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check this property I used. Is it really true that \\(\\gcd(2^n - 1, 2^m - 1) = 2^{\\gcd(n,m)} - 1\\)?\n\nI tested it with small values earlier and it seemed to hold. Let me see if I can find a proof or confirmation of this property.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of the difference between the two numbers.\n\nLet me consider that \\(2^{1012} - 1 = 2^{1012} - 2^{1001} + 2^{1001} - 1 = 2^{1001}(2^{11} - 1) + (2^{1001} - 1)\\).\n\nWait, that seems similar to expressing one number in terms of the other and a multiple of the difference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that \\(2^{1012} - 1 = 2^{1012} - 2^{1001} + 2^{1001} - 1 = 2^{1001}(2^{11} - 1) + (2^{1001} - 1)\\).\n\nIf I let \\(a = 2^{1001} - 1\\) and \\(b = 2^{1012} - 1\\), then \\(b = 2^{1001}(2^{11} - 1) + a\\).\n\nSo, \\(b - 2^{1001}(2^{11} - 1) = a\\).\n\nThis suggests that any common divisor of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must also divide \\(2^{1001}(2^{11} - 1)\\).\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe sticking with the earlier approach is better.\n\nGiven that \\(\\gcd(1001, 1012) = 11\\), and according to the property, \\(\\gcd(2^{1001} - 1, 2^{1012} - 1) = 2^{11} - 1 = 2047\\), that seems to be the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way this could be wrong.\n\nIs there a possibility that the GCD could be different? For example, could there be a common divisor larger than 2047?\n\nWell, \\(2^{11} - 1 = 2047\\), and 2047 is a product of 23 and 89, both prime numbers: \\(23 \\times 89 = 2047\\).\n\nSo, 2047 is the largest possible divisor here.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that \\(2^{11} - 1\\) divides both \\(2^{1001} - 1\\) and \\(2^{1012} - 1\\), because 11 divides both 1001 and 1012.\n\nWait, 11 divides 1001? Let's check: 1001 divided by 11 is 91, yes, exactly.\n\nSimilarly, 1012 divided by 11 is 92, since 11 \u00d7 92 = 1012.\n\nSo, yes, 11 divides both 1001 and 1012, which means \\(2^{11} - 1\\) divides both \\(2^{1001} - 1\\) and \\(2^{1012} - 1\\).\n\nIs there any larger number that divides both? According to the property I used earlier, no, because \\(\\gcd(n,m) = 11\\), so \\(2^{11} - 1\\) should be the GCD.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of \\(2^{1001} - 1\\) and \\(2^{1012} - 1\\) is 2047.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2047} \\]"
