I need to find the correct number that makes the statement true.\n\nFirst, I should recall the relationship between millimeters and decimeters. I know that the metric system is based on powers of ten, and there are prefixes for different multiples of the base unit, which is the meter in this case.\n\nLet me list out the prefixes I remember:\n\n- Kilo- (k) = 1,000\n\n- Hecto- (h) = 100\n\n- Deka- (da) = 10\n\n- Deci- (d) = 0.1\n\n- Centi- (c) = 0.01\n\n- Milli- (m) = 0.001\n\nFrom this list, millimeter is mm, which stands for milli-meter, so it's 0.001 meters. Decimeter is dm, which stands for deci-meter, so it's 0.1 meters.\n\nSo, I need to convert 26.1 millimeters to decimeters.\n\nFirst, I can convert millimeters to meters, and then meters to decimeters.\n\nLet me find the relationship between millimeters and decimeters directly.\n\nI know that:\n\n1 meter = 1,000 millimeters\n\n1 meter = 10 decimeters\n\nSo, 1 decimeter = 100 millimeters (since 1,000 mm / 10 dm = 100 mm/dm)\n\nTherefore, 26.1 mm is equal to how many decimeters?\n\nLet me calculate:\n\n26.1 mm / 100 mm/dm = 0.261 dm\n\nSo, 26.1 mm = 0.261 dm\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 0.261\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternative method:\n\nI can also think in terms of the exponents.\n\n1 mm = 0.001 meters (since milli- is 10^-3)\n\n1 dm = 0.1 meters (since deci- is 10^-1)\n\nSo, to convert from mm to dm:\n\n26.1 mm * (0.001 m / 1 mm) / (0.1 dm / 1 m) = 26.1 * 0.001 / 0.1 = 26.1 * 0.01 = 0.261 dm\n\nAgain, this confirms that 26.1 mm = 0.261 dm\n\nAnother way:\n\nI can use the conversion factor directly.\n\nSince 1 dm = 100 mm, then 26.1 mm is equal to 26.1 / 100 = 0.261 dm\n\nYes, that matches my previous results.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 0.261\n\nI should make sure that I'm not confusing millimeters with other units or misremembering the conversion factors.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the other options:\n\nB. 261: This would be too large, as millimeters are much smaller than decimeters.\n\nC. 2.61: This seems too big compared to 0.261, which is the correct conversion.\n\nD. 2,610: This is definitely incorrect for the same reason.\n\nTherefore, the only plausible answer is A. 0.261\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and I'm confident that A. 0.261 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 0.261} \\]"
