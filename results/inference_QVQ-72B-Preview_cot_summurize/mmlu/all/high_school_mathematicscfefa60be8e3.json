                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that there's a sequence of three real numbers that form an arithmetic progression, and the first term is 9. Then, if you add 2 to the second term and add 20 to the third term, these three new numbers form a geometric progression. I need to find the smallest possible value for the third term of this geometric progression.\n\nFirst, let's recall what an arithmetic progression is. In an arithmetic progression, each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference to the preceding term. So, if the first term is 9, and the common difference is some real number d, then the three terms of the arithmetic progression are:\n\n1. 9\n\n2. 9 + d\n\n3. 9 + 2d\n\nNow, according to the problem, if we add 2 to the second term and add 20 to the third term, we get a geometric progression. So, the modified terms are:\n\n1. 9\n\n2. (9 + d) + 2 = 11 + d\n\n3. (9 + 2d) + 20 = 29 + 2d\n\nSo, these three numbers: 9, 11 + d, and 29 + 2d form a geometric progression.\n\nIn a geometric progression, each term after the first is obtained by multiplying the preceding term by a constant ratio. So, for these three terms, the following must hold:\n\n\\[\\frac{11 + d}{9} = \\frac{29 + 2d}{11 + d}\\]\n\nThis is because in a geometric sequence, the ratio between consecutive terms is constant.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\\frac{11 + d}{9} = \\frac{29 + 2d}{11 + d}\\]\n\nNow, to solve for d, I can cross-multiply:\n\n\\[(11 + d)(11 + d) = 9(29 + 2d)\\]\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: \\((11 + d)^2 = 121 + 22d + d^2\\)\n\nRight side: \\(9 \\times (29 + 2d) = 261 + 18d\\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[121 + 22d + d^2 = 261 + 18d\\]\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\[d^2 + 22d - 18d + 121 - 261 = 0\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[d^2 + 4d - 140 = 0\\]\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: \\(d^2 + 4d - 140 = 0\\)\n\nI can solve this quadratic equation for d using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[d = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\]\n\nHere, a = 1, b = 4, c = -140\n\nSo,\n\n\\[d = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 560}}{2}\\]\\[d = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{576}}{2}\\]\\[d = \\frac{-4 \\pm 24}{2}\\]\n\nSo, two possible solutions for d:\n\n1. \\(d = \\frac{-4 + 24}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10\\)\n\n2. \\(d = \\frac{-4 - 24}{2} = \\frac{-28}{2} = -14\\)\n\nNow, I need to find the corresponding geometric progressions for each value of d and determine which one has the smallest third term.\n\n**Case 1: d = 10**\n\nThe modified terms are:\n\n1. 9\n\n2. 11 + d = 11 + 10 = 21\n\n3. 29 + 2d = 29 + 20 = 49\n\nSo, the geometric progression is 9, 21, 49.\n\nLet me check if this is indeed a geometric progression by verifying the ratios:\n\n\\[\\frac{21}{9} = \\frac{7}{3}\\]\\[\\frac{49}{21} = \\frac{7}{3}\\]\n\nYes, the ratios are equal, so it's a geometric progression.\n\nThe third term is 49.\n\n**Case 2: d = -14**\n\nThe modified terms are:\n\n1. 9\n\n2. 11 + d = 11 - 14 = -3\n\n3. 29 + 2d = 29 - 28 = 1\n\nSo, the geometric progression is 9, -3, 1.\n\nAgain, check the ratios:\n\n\\[\\frac{-3}{9} = -\\frac{1}{3}\\]\\[\\frac{1}{-3} = -\\frac{1}{3}\\]\n\nThe ratios are equal, so this is also a geometric progression.\n\nThe third term is 1.\n\nNow, comparing the third terms from both cases:\n\n- Case 1: 49\n\n- Case 2: 1\n\nSo, the smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression is 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
