                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about water dripping out of a cone, and I need to find out at what rate the height of the water is changing when the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone. The cone has a height of 2 cm and a radius of 1 cm, and water is dripping out at a rate of 3 cm\u00b3 per minute. The volume formula for a cone is V equals \u03c0 over 3 times r squared times h.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand the setup. We have an upside-down cone, and there's a hole at the vertex, so water is dripping out from the top. The cone's height is 2 cm, and its radius is 1 cm. So, the base of the cone is 1 cm in radius, and it's 2 cm tall.\n\nNow, water is dripping out at a rate of 3 cm\u00b3 per minute. That means the volume of water inside the cone is decreasing at that rate.\n\nI need to find the rate at which the height of the water is changing when the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone. So, if the cone is 2 cm tall, and the water level is half a centimeter below the top, that means the height of the water is 2 cm minus 0.5 cm, which is 1.5 cm.\n\nSo, essentially, I need to find dh/dt, the rate of change of height, when h = 1.5 cm.\n\nOkay, to approach this, I think I need to use related rates, which involves differentiating the volume formula with respect to time.\n\nBut, since both radius and height are changing as the water level changes, I need to relate r and h in a way that allows me to express the volume in terms of h only.\n\nI recall that for similar cones, the ratio of corresponding sides is constant. So, the ratio of radius to height should be the same for the water cone as it is for the original cone.\n\nThe original cone has a radius of 1 cm and a height of 2 cm, so r/h = 1/2, or r = h/2.\n\nWait, but that seems off because if the height is 2 cm and radius is 1 cm, r = (1/2)h.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for the water cone, which is similar to the original cone, the same ratio applies: r = (1/2)h.\n\nTherefore, I can substitute r in the volume formula with (1/2)h.\n\nSo, V = (\u03c0/3) * r\u00b2 * h = (\u03c0/3) * ( (1/2)h )\u00b2 * h.\n\nLet me simplify that: (\u03c0/3) * (1/4)h\u00b2 * h = (\u03c0/12)h\u00b3.\n\nSo, V = (\u03c0/12)h\u00b3.\n\nNow, since the volume is decreasing at a rate of 3 cm\u00b3/min, I have dV/dt = -3 cm\u00b3/min.\n\nI need to find dh/dt when h = 1.5 cm.\n\nTo find dh/dt, I can differentiate V with respect to time t.\n\nSo, dV/dt = dV/dh * dh/dt.\n\nI know dV/dt = -3 cm\u00b3/min.\n\nAnd dV/dh for V = (\u03c0/12)h\u00b3 is dV/dh = (\u03c0/12) * 3h\u00b2 = (\u03c0/4)h\u00b2.\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\n-3 = (\u03c0/4)h\u00b2 * dh/dt.\n\nI need to solve for dh/dt when h = 1.5 cm.\n\nSo, dh/dt = -3 / [(\u03c0/4)(1.5)\u00b2].\n\nLet me calculate (1.5)\u00b2: 2.25.\n\nSo, dh/dt = -3 / (\u03c0/4 * 2.25) = -3 / (\u03c0 * 0.5625) = -3 / (\u03c0 * 9/16) = -3 / (9\u03c0/16) = -3 * 16/(9\u03c0) = -48/(9\u03c0) = -16/(3\u03c0) cm/min.\n\nSo, the rate of change of height is -16/(3\u03c0) cm per minute.\n\nLooking back at the options, that's option D.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, V = (\u03c0/3)r\u00b2h.\n\nGiven r = (1/2)h, then V = (\u03c0/3)*(1/4)h\u00b2*h = (\u03c0/12)h\u00b3.\n\ndV/dh = (\u03c0/12)*3h\u00b2 = (\u03c0/4)h\u00b2.\n\ndV/dt = -3 cm\u00b3/min.\n\nSo, dV/dt = dV/dh * dh/dt.\n\nTherefore, -3 = (\u03c0/4)h\u00b2 * dh/dt.\n\nSolving for dh/dt: dh/dt = -3 / [(\u03c0/4)h\u00b2].\n\nWhen h = 1.5 cm, dh/dt = -3 / [(\u03c0/4)*(9/4)] = -3 / (9\u03c0/16) = -3 * 16/(9\u03c0) = -48/(9\u03c0) = -16/(3\u03c0) cm/min.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the similar cones and set up a proportion, but I think this approach is straightforward.\n\nI should also consider whether the cone is being emptied or filled, but since water is dripping out, the volume is decreasing, which is consistent with my negative dh/dt.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. -16/(3\u03c0) cm/min.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ -\\dfrac{16}{3\\pi}\\ \\text{cm/min}} \\]"
