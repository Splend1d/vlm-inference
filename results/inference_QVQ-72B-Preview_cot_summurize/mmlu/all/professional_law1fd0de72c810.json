                    "text": "So I've got this contract law scenario here, and I need to figure out what the creditor can recover from the buyer if they bring a lawsuit. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a contract between a seller and a buyer for 1,000 widgets at $10 each, totaling $10,000. The terms are FOB at the seller's place of business. That means the buyer owns the goods once they're placed on the transportation vehicle, right? So, title passes to the buyer at that point.\n\nOn March 1, the seller puts the widgets on a cargo vessel headed to the buyer. Then, on March 2, the seller sends a telegram to the buyer saying that the widgets are in transit and that they're assigning all their rights under the contract to their creditor. The buyer doesn't consent to this assignment.\n\nThe next day, the ship sinks in a storm, and all the widgets are lost. Now, the creditor wants to bring an action against the buyer. The question is, what will the creditor most likely recover?\n\nOkay, so let's think about this. The contract had a clause saying that any party who wishes to assign the contract must have the written consent of the other party. The seller tried to assign their rights to the creditor, but the buyer didn't consent.\n\nI remember that generally, assignments of rights under a contract don't require the consent of the other party unless the contract specifically says so. In this case, the contract does say that consent is needed for an assignment. So, does that mean the assignment is invalid without the buyer's consent?\n\nWait, but typically, assignments of rights are permissible unless the contract prohibits them explicitly. Here, it says \"must have the written consent of the other party,\" which suggests that without consent, the assignment may not be valid.\n\nBut, in some jurisdictions, even if the contract requires consent for assignment, the assignee (the creditor in this case) may still have some rights, especially if the assignment is of rights and not duties.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to look into the law regarding assignments in contracts, especially when consent is required.\n\nLet me recall: An assignment is when one party transfers their rights under a contract to another party. Generally, assignments of rights are allowed unless there's a contractual provision prohibiting it or it's against public policy.\n\nIn this case, the contract explicitly requires the other party's written consent for an assignment. So, without the buyer's consent, the assignment might be invalid.\n\nBut, sometimes, the requirement of consent is only for the benefit of the original party, and the assignee can still enforce the contract against the other party.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), since widgets are goods, and FOB terms are related to delivery of goods.\n\nUnder the UCC, assignments of contract rights are generally permissible, but if the contract has a clause requiring consent for assignment, then consent is needed.\n\nIn this scenario, the seller assigned their rights to the creditor without the buyer's consent. So, perhaps the assignment is invalid, and the creditor can't enforce the contract against the buyer.\n\nBut, wait a minute, the widgets were already placed on the vessel on March 1, and title had passed to the buyer at that point, since it was FOB seller's place of business. So, the buyer owns the widgets, but they haven't received them yet because the ship sank.\n\nNow, if the creditor tries to enforce the contract against the buyer to get the $10,000, what's the status of that claim?\n\nWell, if the assignment is invalid because consent was required and not given, then maybe the creditor can't enforce the contract directly against the buyer.\n\nBut, perhaps the seller's assignment of their rights to the creditor is still valid to some extent, and the creditor can step into the shoes of the seller to claim payment from the buyer.\n\nHowever, since the goods were lost at sea, the buyer didn't receive the widgets. Would the buyer still have to pay for them?\n\nUnder FOB seller's place of business terms, the buyer takes ownership and risk of loss once the goods are placed on the carrier. So, even though the ship sank, the buyer would typically still have to pay for the widgets because they owned them at the time of loss.\n\nBut, there might be an exception if the loss was due to some fault of the seller or if the goods didn't conform to the contract.\n\nIn this case, the widgets were lost due to a storm, which seems like an act of God or fortuitous event. So, it's probably a risk that the buyer has to bear.\n\nTherefore, even though the buyer didn't receive the widgets, they might still be obligated to pay the contract price to the seller.\n\nBut now, the seller has assigned their rights to the creditor, but without the buyer's consent, as required by the contract.\n\nSo, perhaps the assignment is invalid, and the creditor can't enforce the contract against the buyer.\n\nBut, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the assignment is still effective against the buyer, despite the lack of consent, for the purposes of assigning the right to receive payment.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should look at it differently.\n\nSuppose the creditor is trying to step into the shoes of the seller and collect the contract price from the buyer. If the assignment is valid, then the creditor can do that. If not, then perhaps not.\n\nBut, even if the assignment is invalid, the creditor might still have a claim against the seller for the amount owed, and then the seller could sue the buyer for the contract price.\n\nBut, in practice, assignments without consent might still be enforceable, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the requirement for consent is only to protect the assignor from claims by the assignee, and the assignee can still enforce the contract against the obligor (the buyer).\n\nI'm getting more confused. Maybe I should consider the options given in the question.\n\nOption A says nothing, because the buyer never assented to the assignment.\n\nOption B says nothing, because the buyer never received the widgets.\n\nOption C says the contract price of $10,000.\n\nOption D says the difference between the contract price and the market value of the widgets.\n\nSo, between these, I need to choose the most likely recovery for the creditor.\n\nIf the assignment is invalid due to lack of consent, then perhaps the creditor can't enforce the contract directly against the buyer. So, options A and B might be possible.\n\nBut, if the assignment is still effective for some purposes, then maybe the creditor can recover the contract price.\n\nAlternatively, since the goods were lost, maybe there's some adjustment based on the market value.\n\nWait, but the contract was for a fixed price, so unless there's a price adjustment clause, the buyer has to pay the full contract price regardless of market value.\n\nI think option D is less likely unless there's a specific reason to adjust the price based on market value.\n\nOption B suggests that because the buyer never received the widgets, they don't have to pay anything. But, under FOB seller's place of business terms, the buyer takes ownership and risk of loss once the goods are shipped. So, even if the goods are lost in transit, the buyer might still have to pay.\n\nBut, if the assignment is invalid, perhaps the creditor can't enforce the contract against the buyer, and the buyer might not have to pay.\n\nThis is complicated. Maybe I need to think about it in terms of who has the right to collect the payment.\n\nIf the seller assigned their rights to the creditor without consent, and the buyer didn't consent, then perhaps the assignment is ineffective as against the buyer.\n\nIn that case, the seller remains the party with the right to collect the payment from the buyer.\n\nSo, if the creditor tries to collect, the buyer could say, \"I don't recognize your assignment; I'll pay the seller.\"\n\nBut, if the seller is in default or something, maybe the creditor still has a claim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assignment is still effective for the purpose of transferring the right to receive payment, even without consent.\n\nI'm still unsure.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the buyer, having taken ownership of the widgets when they were shipped, owes the contract price to someone. If the seller assigned their rights to the creditor, even without consent, perhaps the buyer has to pay the creditor.\n\nBut, the buyer didn't consent to the assignment, so maybe they can refuse.\n\nThis seems like a situation where the law might side with the buyer, and the creditor can't enforce the contract without the required consent.\n\nTherefore, the creditor would likely recover nothing, either because the buyer didn't assent to the assignment (option A) or because the buyer didn't receive the widgets (option B).\n\nBetween options A and B, option A seems more accurate because it directly refers to the lack of consent for the assignment.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A: nothing, because the buyer never assented to the assignment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
