                    "text": "So I have this question about when attachment to a care-giver begins. The options are:\n\nA. in the hours immediately following birth\n\nB. several weeks after birth\n\nC. several months after birth\n\nD. when the child learns to speak\n\nHmm, I need to think about this. I remember learning about attachment in psychology classes, especially about Bowlby and Ainsworth's work on attachment theory.\n\nLet me recall: Attachment theory suggests that infants form strong emotional bonds with their caregivers, typically starting from an early age. John Bowlby proposed that attachment is an evolutionary adaptation that helps ensure children stay close to their caregivers for protection and care.\n\nMary Ainsworth further developed this theory through her \"Strange Situation\" experiments, which observed how infants reacted to separations and reunions with their caregivers.\n\nNow, considering this, when exactly does this attachment start to form?\n\nOption A says in the hours immediately following birth. That seems pretty soon after birth. I know that there's something called the \"bonding\" period right after birth, where parents and infants can establish a connection. However, I think that true attachment, where the infant shows a preference for the caregiver and seeks comfort from them, develops a bit later.\n\nOption B suggests several weeks after birth. This seems plausible. Infants start to recognize familiar faces and voices around this time, and they might begin to show preferences for their primary caregivers.\n\nOption C says several months after birth. This also sounds possible. By around 6-8 months, infants typically show stranger anxiety, which is often seen as a sign of attachment because they are distressed when a stranger approaches but comforted by the presence of a familiar caregiver.\n\nOption D mentions when the child learns to speak. That seems too late, as attachment forms well before children start talking. Most children begin speaking around 12-18 months, but attachment starts forming much earlier.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think the correct answer is either B or C. Let me try to recall some specific milestones.\n\nI believe that attachment behaviors start to emerge around 2-3 months of age, when infants begin to smile and coo in response to their caregivers. Then, around 6-8 months, as I mentioned earlier, they start to show separation anxiety and stranger anxiety, which are clear indicators of attachment.\n\nSo, if I had to choose between B and C, I'd probably go with C, several months after birth, because that seems to align better with the developmental milestones I recall.\n\nBut to make sure, maybe I should consider some specific studies or research findings.\n\nFor example, Mary Ainsworth's Strange Situation procedure, which is a key part of attachment theory, typically assesses attachment at around 12-18 months of age. However, that's more about classifying the type of attachment rather than when it begins.\n\nI recall that Bowlby and others suggest that attachment forms gradually over the first year of life, with the critical period being around 6-8 months to 18-24 months.\n\nGiven this, option C, several months after birth, seems the most accurate.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about it in terms of the different stages of attachment.\n\nI think Bowlby proposed several stages of attachment:\n\n1. Pre-attachment phase (from birth to around 6 weeks): Infants respond similarly to all people and are not yet attached to any specific caregiver.\n\n2. Attachment in the making (from around 6 weeks to around 6-8 months): Infants start to show preferences for familiar caregivers over strangers.\n\n3. Clear-cut attachment (from around 6-8 months to around 18-24 months): Infants show separation anxiety and use caregivers as a secure base for exploration.\n\n4. Formation of reciprocal relationships (from around 18-24 months onward): Children begin to understand the emotions and needs of their caregivers and interact with them in more reciprocal ways.\n\nBased on this staging, clear-cut attachment begins around 6-8 months, which would fall into option C, several months after birth.\n\nHowever, if I consider the beginning of attachment from the pre-attachment phase, which starts at birth, but true attachment behaviors emerge around 6-8 months, it's still within the \"several months after birth\" timeframe.\n\nOption B, several weeks after birth, might correspond to the \"attachment in the making\" phase, which starts around 6 weeks. But even then, the critical period for attachment is more towards several months rather than several weeks.\n\nMoreover, in clinical practice, pediatricians and psychologists generally consider that attachment is well-established by around 6-8 months, which again points to option C.\n\nAnother consideration is that interventions aimed at promoting attachment are often targeted at infants who are several months old, emphasizing the importance of this period for forming strong bonds.\n\nAdditionally, from a developmental psychology perspective, infants at around 3-4 months start to engage in social smiling, laughing, and other behaviors that foster bonds with caregivers, further supporting the idea that attachment forms during this period.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, I believe the correct answer is C. several months after birth.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the other options again:\n\nA. in the hours immediately following birth: While bonding can occur immediately after birth, true attachment, characterized by specific emotional bonds and behaviors, typically develops over time.\n\nB. several weeks after birth: This might correspond to the early stages of attachment formation, but the peak of attachment development occurs later.\n\nD. when the child learns to speak: This is too late, as attachment forms well before language development.\n\nHence, option C remains the best answer.\n\nIn conclusion, attachment to a care-giver begins several months after birth.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
