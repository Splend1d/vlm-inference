                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about cognitive dissonance theory and self-perception theory in the context of a social psychology experiment. The scenario is that a psychologist offers participants either $1.00 or $20.00 to tell potential participants that a dull experiment is very interesting. I need to determine which theory predicts that participants in the $1.00 condition will report greater liking for the dull experiment compared to those in the $20.00 condition, and vice versa.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what cognitive dissonance theory and self-perception theory are all about.\n\nStarting with cognitive dissonance theory, I recall that it was proposed by Leon Festinger. It suggests that when individuals hold two or more conflicting beliefs, attitudes, or values, they experience discomfort or dissonance. To reduce this dissonance, people are motivated to change their attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors to make them consistent.\n\nIn the context of this experiment, participants are being asked to say that a dull experiment is interesting. If they know it's dull but say it's interesting, there's a dissonance between their belief (it's dull) and their behavior (saying it's interesting). According to cognitive dissonance theory, they should experience discomfort from this inconsistency and may try to reduce it by changing their attitude toward the experiment\u2014to believe that it's actually interesting.\n\nNow, the amount of money they're offered ($1.00 vs. $20.00) might influence how much dissonance they experience. If someone is paid only $1.00 to lie about the experiment being interesting, they might feel more dissonance because the payment isn't sufficient to justify the lie. As a result, they might change their attitude more strongly to believe that the experiment is indeed interesting, to reduce the dissonance.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone is paid $20.00 to lie about the experiment being interesting, they might feel that the payment is substantial enough to justify the lie, so they experience less dissonance. Therefore, they might not need to change their attitude as much to believe that the experiment is interesting.\n\nSo, according to cognitive dissonance theory, participants in the $1.00 condition should report greater liking for the dull experiment because they experience more dissonance and thus change their attitude more to reduce it.\n\nNow, let's look at self-perception theory. This theory, proposed by Daryl Bem, suggests that people infer their attitudes and emotions from their own behavior and the circumstances under which that behavior occurs. Essentially, people observe their own behavior and then try to figure out what attitudes must have caused that behavior.\n\nIn this experiment, participants are asked to tell potential participants that the dull experiment is interesting. If they're paid $1.00, they might think, \"I'm only getting $1.00 to say this, so maybe I really do think the experiment is interesting.\" Thus, they might infer that their behavior of praising the experiment is based on their actual positive attitude toward it.\n\nHowever, if they're paid $20.00, they might think, \"I'm getting a substantial amount to say this, so it's probably just because of the money that I'm saying it's interesting.\" In this case, they might attribute their behavior to the external incentive rather than to their actual attitude.\n\nTherefore, according to self-perception theory, participants in the $1.00 condition should also report greater liking for the dull experiment because they attribute their behavior to their actual attitude, whereas in the $20.00 condition, they attribute their behavior to the external reward.\n\nWait a minute, does self-perception theory predict the opposite? Actually, I think I need to double-check that.\n\nLet me think again. According to self-perception theory, when the external incentives are low ($1.00), participants might attribute their behavior to their actual attitude (i.e., they must think the experiment is interesting to say so for such a low payment). Conversely, when the external incentives are high ($20.00), they might attribute their behavior to the payment rather than to their actual attitude.\n\nSo, in the $1.00 condition, they might infer that they liked the experiment because there's no other good reason to say it's interesting for such a low payment. In the $20.00 condition, they might think they're saying it's interesting just for the money and don't necessarily like it.\n\nTherefore, both cognitive dissonance theory and self-perception theory would predict that participants in the $1.00 condition would report greater liking for the dull experiment compared to those in the $20.00 condition.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Cognitive dissonance theory predicts that participants in the $1.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment, while self-perception theory predicts that participants in the $20.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment.\n\nB. Self-perception theory predicts that participants in the $1.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment, while cognitive dissonance theory predicts that participants in the $20.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment.\n\nC. Cognitive dissonance theory and self-perception theory both predict that participants in the $1.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment than will those in the $20.00 condition.\n\nD. Cognitive dissonance theory and self-perception theory both predict that participants in the $20.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment than will those in the $1.00 condition.\n\nBased on my understanding, option C seems correct because both theories predict that participants in the $1.00 condition will report greater liking for the dull experiment compared to those in the $20.00 condition.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe I should consider the classic experiment by Festinger and Carlsmith (1959), which is often cited in relation to cognitive dissonance. In that experiment, participants were asked to perform a boring task and then to tell the next participant that it was interesting, either for a high or low reward. The results showed that those who were paid a low reward ($1) later rated the task as more interesting than those paid a high reward ($20), which aligns with cognitive dissonance theory.\n\nSimilarly, according to self-perception theory, in the low-reward condition, participants would attribute their behavior to their actual attitude, leading them to believe they found the task interesting. In the high-reward condition, they would attribute their behavior to the reward rather than to their attitude.\n\nTherefore, both theories predict that participants in the low-reward condition will report greater liking for the dull experiment compared to those in the high-reward condition.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C: Cognitive dissonance theory and self-perception theory both predict that participants in the $1.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment than will those in the $20.00 condition.\n\nI think that's the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
