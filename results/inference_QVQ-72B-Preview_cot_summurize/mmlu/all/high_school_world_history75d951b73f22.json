                    "text": "So I've got this poem here, \"To Roosevelt\" by Ruben Dario, written in 1904. It's addressed to Theodore Roosevelt, who was the President of the United States at that time. The poem seems to be a strong statement about Latin America and its relationship with the United States. I need to figure out which statement best reflects the theme of the poem from the options given.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand the context. In 1904, the United States was becoming a major world power and was involved in various interventions in Latin America. Roosevelt was known for his assertive foreign policy, especially in the Western Hemisphere. So, the poem is likely responding to American actions or attitudes towards Latin America during that period.\n\nLet me read the poem again to get a better sense of its message. It starts by saying, \"You are the United States, you are the future invader of the native America that has Indian blood, that still prays to Jesus Christ and still speaks Spanish.\" This seems to be addressing the United States as an impending threat to Latin America, which is portrayed as having indigenous heritage, Christian faith, and Spanish language.\n\nThen it says, \"you are Alexander-Nebuchadnezzar. You think that life is fire, that progress is eruption, that wherever you shoot you hit the future. No.\" Here, the poet is comparing the United States to historical conquerors like Alexander the Great and Nebuchadnezzar, suggesting that their approach to progress through conquest is misguided.\n\nThe next part highlights the rich cultural history of Latin America: \"our America, that has had poets since the ancient times of Netzahualcoyotl, that consulted the stars, that knew Atlantis whose resounding name comes to us from Plato, that since the remote times of its life has lived on light, on fire, on perfume, on love.\" This emphasizes the depth and beauty of Latin American culture, suggesting that it has a profound and ancient heritage that predates European colonization.\n\nIt continues with, \"America of the great Montezuma, of the Inca, the fragrant America of Christopher Columbus, Catholic America, Spanish America, the America in which noble Cuauht\u00e9moc said: 'I'm not in a bed of roses', that America that trembles in hurricanes and lives on love, it lives, you men of Saxon eyes and barbarous soul.\" Here, the poet is acknowledging the various influences on Latin America, from indigenous empires like the Aztecs and Incas, to the arrival of Columbus and the subsequent Spanish colonization. The reference to Cuauht\u00e9moc, the last Aztec emperor, who said, \"I'm not in a bed of roses,\" suggests a recognition of the struggles and hardships faced by Latin Americans.\n\nThe poem then warns, \"Be careful. Viva Spanish America! There are a thousand cubs loosed from the Spanish lion. Roosevelt, one would have to be, through God himself, the-fearful rifleman and strong hunter, to manage to grab us in your iron claws. And, although you count on everything, you lack one thing: God!\" This part is a clear warning to Roosevelt and the United States, suggesting that Latin America is not an easy target and that any attempt to dominate it will be met with resistance.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Latin Americans are too na?ve and should fight back.\n\nThe poem doesn't portray Latin Americans as naive. Instead, it praises their culture and history and warns against underestimating their strength and resilience. So, this option doesn't seem to align with the poem's message.\n\nB. Latin America has survived many invaders and will endure.\n\nThis seems plausible. The poem references multiple invaders and historical figures, suggesting a long history of surviving challenges. It also emphasizes the enduring nature of Latin American culture and spirit.\n\nC. The Spanish have already destroyed Latin American culture.\n\nThis contradicts the poem's message. The poet celebrates the rich cultural heritage of Latin America, including its indigenous roots and Spanish influences. He doesn't depict Latin American culture as destroyed but rather as vibrant and enduring.\n\nD. Change is necessary for progress.\n\nWhile the poem does critique the idea of progress through eruption and fire, it doesn't embrace change for the sake of progress. Instead, it seems to value the preservation of Latin American culture and identity.\n\nBased on this analysis, option B seems to best reflect the theme of the poem. The poet is asserting that Latin America has a deep and resilient culture that has withstood previous invaders and will continue to endure despite the threats posed by the United States.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there are any other interpretations. For example, perhaps the poem is advocating for resistance and self-determination, which aligns with option B's idea of enduring through challenges. Option A suggests naivety, which isn't supported by the text; option C is directly contradicted by the poem's celebration of Latin American culture; and option D doesn't capture the poem's central message.\n\nTherefore, the statement that best reflects the theme of the poem is:\n\nB. Latin America has survived many invaders and will endure.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
