                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a CPA performing agreed-upon procedures. It's a bit confusing, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, what are agreed-upon procedures? From what I recall, agreed-upon procedures are a type of assurance service where the CPA carries out specific procedures agreed upon by the client and any other relevant parties. Unlike a standard audit, where the CPA has to follow a set of auditing standards and provide an opinion on the financial statements, in agreed-upon procedures, the focus is more on performing specific checks or calculations and reporting the findings without providing an opinion.\n\nIn this case, the CPA is engaged to calculate the rate of return on a specified investment using an agreed-upon formula and to verify that this rate matches what's shown in an identified schedule. So, the procedures are clear: calculate the rate and check if it agrees with the schedule.\n\nNow, the question is about what the CPA's report should contain. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. An opinion about the fairness of the agreed-upon procedures.\n\nWait a minute, in agreed-upon procedures, the CPA doesn't provide an opinion. They're just supposed to carry out the procedures and report the findings. So, including an opinion about the fairness of the procedures seems out of place. Maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nB. A separate paragraph describing the effectiveness of the internal controls.\n\nHmm, internal controls are related to the system the company has in place to manage risks and ensure accurate financial reporting. In a standard audit, the CPA would assess internal controls, but in agreed-upon procedures, the focus is narrow, specifically on the procedures agreed upon. Unless the procedures include evaluating internal controls, I don't think the CPA would be reporting on the effectiveness of internal controls here. So, probably not this option.\n\nC. A disclaimer of responsibility for the sufficiency of those procedures.\n\nThis one is interesting. It suggests that the CPA is not taking responsibility for whether the agreed-upon procedures are sufficient for the purpose intended by the engaging parties. That makes sense because the procedures are agreed upon by the parties involved, not determined by the CPA based on auditing standards. So, the CPA is essentially saying, \"I've done what you asked me to do, but I'm not responsible for whether these procedures are enough to meet your needs.\" This seems like a important disclaimer to include in the report.\n\nD. A disclaimer of opinion on the fair presentation of the financial statements.\n\nThis sounds familiar from other types of engagements, like reviews or compilations, where the CPA doesn't provide an opinion on the financial statements. In agreed-upon procedures, since the CPA is not auditing the financial statements but rather performing specific procedures, it's appropriate to include a disclaimer that they are not expressing an opinion on the fair presentation of the financial statements.\n\nSo, between options C and D, both seem relevant. But let's think about which one is most directly related to the CPA's report in this scenario.\n\nOption C is about disclaiming responsibility for the sufficiency of the procedures. That is, the CPA is not saying whether the procedures are enough to achieve the engaging parties' objectives. This is important because the CPA is only doing what's been agreed upon and isn't taking on the responsibility of designing the procedures.\n\nOption D is about disclaiming an opinion on the fair presentation of the financial statements. In this case, the CPA is not auditing the financial statements; they're performing specific procedures related to calculating and verifying a rate of return.\n\nI think both disclaimers are important, but perhaps the primary focus should be on disclaiming responsibility for the sufficiency of the procedures, since that's the core of the engagement. The disclaimer about the financial statements might also be included, but it's not the main point.\n\nLet me check some resources to confirm this.\n\nI recall that in agreed-upon procedures engagements, the CPA's report should include:\n\n- A title that indicates the nature of the engagement, such as \"Report on Agreed-Upon Procedures.\"\n\n- A description of the procedures performed.\n\n- The findings from applying those procedures.\n\n- A statement that the engagement was performed in accordance with Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAEs).\n\n- A disclaimer that the report is intended solely for the information and use of specified parties.\n\n- A statement that the CPA does not express an opinion or conclusion, or provide negative assurance on the subject matter or assertion.\n\nGiven this, option C seems to align with the requirement to disclaim responsibility for the sufficiency of the procedures. It's crucial because the procedures are agreed upon by the parties, and the CPA is not designing them to meet auditing standards.\n\nOption D, disclaiming an opinion on the fair presentation of the financial statements, might also be included, but it's not the primary focus of the engagement. The main point is to report on the specific procedures and findings related to the rate of return, not to provide assurance on the financial statements as a whole.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is C: a disclaimer of responsibility for the sufficiency of those procedures.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any chance that another option could be correct.\n\nOption A, providing an opinion about the fairness of the agreed-upon procedures, contradicts the nature of agreed-upon procedures engagements. In these engagements, the CPA does not provide an opinion but rather reports the factual findings based on the agreed-upon procedures.\n\nOption B, describing the effectiveness of internal controls, is generally not part of agreed-upon procedures unless specifically included in the procedures. Since the engagement is focused on calculating and verifying a rate of return, reporting on internal controls would be outside the scope unless specified.\n\nOption D, while relevant, is secondary to the primary purpose of the engagement, which is to perform and report on the agreed-upon procedures.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, I believe the correct answer is C: a disclaimer of responsibility for the sufficiency of those procedures.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
