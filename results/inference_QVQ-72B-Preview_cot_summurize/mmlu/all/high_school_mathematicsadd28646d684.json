                    "text": "I'm trying to solve this problem about function transformations. So, the problem says that if the graph of \\( y = f(x) \\) is shifted 20 units to the right, it looks exactly the same as the original graph. That means the function is periodic, right? Like, shifting it by 20 units brings it back to itself. So, the function must have a period of 20.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify that it's periodic. It just says that shifting it 20 units to the right makes it identical to the original. So, that implies that \\( f(x - 20) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\). That's the definition of a periodic function with period 20.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the smallest positive \\( a \\) such that shifting \\( y = f\\left( \\frac{x}{5} \\right) \\) by \\( a \\) units to the right results in the same graph as \\( y = f\\left( \\frac{x}{5} \\right) \\).\n\nSo, I need to find the smallest positive \\( a \\) where \\( f\\left( \\frac{x - a}{5} \\right) = f\\left( \\frac{x}{5} \\right) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nSince \\( f(x - 20) = f(x) \\), I can substitute \\( x \\) with \\( \\frac{x}{5} \\) in this periodicity condition.\n\nLet me try that:\n\n\\( f\\left( \\frac{x}{5} - 20 \\right) = f\\left( \\frac{x}{5} \\right) \\).\n\nWait, no. That doesn't seem directly applicable. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the function \\( g(x) = f\\left( \\frac{x}{5} \\right) \\). I need to find the smallest positive \\( a \\) such that \\( g(x - a) = g(x) \\).\n\nSo, \\( g(x - a) = f\\left( \\frac{x - a}{5} \\right) \\), and I want this to equal \\( g(x) = f\\left( \\frac{x}{5} \\right) \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( f\\left( \\frac{x - a}{5} \\right) = f\\left( \\frac{x}{5} \\right) \\).\n\nNow, since \\( f(x - 20) = f(x) \\), I can set \\( \\frac{x - a}{5} - 20 = \\frac{x}{5} \\), but that doesn't make sense because the left side depends on \\( x \\), and the right side depends on \\( x \\), but I need a constant shift.\n\nWait, perhaps I should set \\( \\frac{x - a}{5} = \\frac{x}{5} + k \\), where \\( k \\) is some constant that relates to the period.\n\nBut I know that \\( f(x - 20) = f(x) \\), so the period of \\( f \\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the argument of \\( f \\) inside \\( g(x) \\) must satisfy a similar periodicity condition.\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{x - a}{5} = \\frac{x}{5} + n \\cdot 20 \\), where \\( n \\) is an integer.\n\nSimplifying, \\( \\frac{x - a}{5} - \\frac{x}{5} = n \\cdot 20 \\),\n\nWhich simplifies to \\( -\\frac{a}{5} = n \\cdot 20 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( a = -n \\cdot 100 \\).\n\nBut \\( a \\) must be positive, so \\( n \\) must be negative. But periods are positive, so maybe \\( n \\) should be positive, and I need the smallest positive \\( a \\).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to set \\( \\frac{x - a}{5} = \\frac{x}{5} + k \\cdot 20 \\), where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\nThen, \\( \\frac{x - a}{5} - \\frac{x}{5} = k \\cdot 20 \\),\n\nWhich gives \\( -\\frac{a}{5} = k \\cdot 20 \\),\n\nSo, \\( a = -k \\cdot 100 \\).\n\nAgain, \\( a \\) needs to be positive, so \\( k \\) should be negative.\n\nBut the smallest positive \\( a \\) would correspond to \\( k = -1 \\), so \\( a = -(-1) \\cdot 100 = 100 \\).\n\nWait, but the options include 100, but also other numbers. Maybe I need to consider the scaling factor of 5 inside the function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the period of \\( g(x) = f\\left( \\frac{x}{5} \\right) \\).\n\nIf \\( f \\) has a period of 20, then \\( f\\left( \\frac{x}{5} \\right) \\) will have a period of \\( 5 \\times 20 = 100 \\), because the argument is scaled by a factor of 1/5, so the period should be stretched by a factor of 5.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think.\n\nIf \\( f(x - 20) = f(x) \\), then \\( f\\left( \\frac{x}{5} - 20 \\right) = f\\left( \\frac{x}{5} \\right) \\).\n\nBut \\( \\frac{x}{5} - 20 = \\frac{x - 100}{5} \\), so \\( f\\left( \\frac{x - 100}{5} \\right) = f\\left( \\frac{x}{5} \\right) \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( g(x - 100) = g(x) \\), which means that \\( g \\) has a period of 100.\n\nSo, the smallest positive \\( a \\) is 100.\n\nBut let's check if smaller \\( a \\) could also satisfy the condition.\n\nSuppose \\( a = 5 \\), then \\( g(x - 5) = f\\left( \\frac{x - 5}{5} \\right) = f\\left( \\frac{x}{5} - 1 \\right) \\), which is not necessarily equal to \\( g(x) = f\\left( \\frac{x}{5} \\right) \\), unless \\( f \\) has additional periodicity.\n\nSimilarly, for \\( a = 4 \\), \\( g(x - 4) = f\\left( \\frac{x - 4}{5} \\right) = f\\left( \\frac{x}{5} - \\frac{4}{5} \\right) \\), which again doesn't necessarily equal \\( g(x) \\).\n\nFor \\( a = 20 \\), \\( g(x - 20) = f\\left( \\frac{x - 20}{5} \\right) = f\\left( \\frac{x}{5} - 4 \\right) \\), which again doesn't necessarily equal \\( g(x) \\) unless \\( f \\) has period 4, which it doesn't.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive \\( a \\) that satisfies the condition is 100.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 100.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 100} \\]"
