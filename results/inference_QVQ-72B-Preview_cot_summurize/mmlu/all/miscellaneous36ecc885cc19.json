                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about monopolies, and I need to figure out which of these statements is true. I'm a bit rusty on monopolies, but I think I can work through this.\n\nOption A says that a monopoly competes with many firms selling the same product in the market. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. By definition, a monopoly is when there's only one seller in the market, right? So, if there's only one firm selling the product, there can't be many firms competing. Maybe this option is false.\n\nOption B says that a monopoly has to lower its price on all units to sell more output. Okay, so in a monopoly, the firm is the sole provider of a good or service, and it faces a downward-sloping demand curve. That means to sell more, it has to lower the price. But does it have to lower the price on all units? I think in monopoly, when they lower the price, they lower it for all units sold beyond the previous quantity. So, maybe this is true.\n\nOption C says that its marginal revenue increases as output sold increases. Wait, in monopoly, the marginal revenue curve is also downward-sloping, but does MR increase as output increases? I think in monopoly, MR decreases as output increases because the firm has to lower the price to sell more, and that affects marginal revenue. So, probably not true.\n\nOption D says that it sets a price below average variable cost to drive its competitors out of the market. But in a monopoly, there are no competitors to drive out, right? The monopolist is the only seller in the market. So, setting a price below average variable cost wouldn't make sense because it's not trying to get rid of competitors. Maybe this is false too.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- A: Seems false because monopoly means one seller, no competitors.\n\n- B: Seems true because of the downward-sloping demand curve.\n\n- C: Seems false because MR decreases as output increases in a monopoly.\n\n- D: Seems false because there are no competitors to drive out.\n\nSo, by elimination, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it again. In a monopoly, the firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve. To sell more quantity, it has to lower the price. And this applies to all units sold beyond the previous quantity. So, yes, to sell one more unit, it has to lower the price on all units sold up to that point. That's how monopolies work.\n\nTherefore, option B is true.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
