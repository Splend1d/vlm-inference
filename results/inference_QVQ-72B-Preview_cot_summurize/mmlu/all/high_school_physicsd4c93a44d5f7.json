                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: a box weighs 80 N on Earth, and I need to find out what its weight would be on the Moon, given that the Moon has 1/80th the mass and 1/4th the radius of the Earth. The options are 1 N, 10 N, 16 N, or 20 N.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how weight is calculated. I know that weight is essentially the force due to gravity acting on an object. So, weight (W) is given by W = m * g, where m is the mass of the object and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nOn Earth, we have a gravitational acceleration of about 9.8 m/s\u00b2, but for this problem, I think we're supposed to consider the gravitational force based on the masses and radii of the planets.\n\nLet me think about the gravitational force between two masses. It's given by Newton's law of universal gravitation: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r\u00b2, where G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers.\n\nIn this case, the box is being attracted to the Earth or the Moon, so F = G * (m_box * m_planet) / r_planet\u00b2.\n\nBut since weight is the force exerted by gravity, and we're dealing with the weight of the box on different celestial bodies, I can use this formula.\n\nGiven that the box weighs 80 N on Earth, and we know Earth's mass and radius, but we don't have those exact values here. Instead, we're given that the Moon has 1/80th the mass and 1/4th the radius of the Earth.\n\nMaybe I can express the gravitational force on the Moon in terms of the Earth's gravitational force.\n\nLet me denote:\n\ng_Earth = G * m_Earth / r_Earth\u00b2\n\ng_Moon = G * m_Moon / r_Moon\u00b2\n\nGiven that m_Moon = m_Earth / 80 and r_Moon = r_Earth / 4.\n\nSo, g_Moon = G * (m_Earth / 80) / (r_Earth / 4)\u00b2\n\nSimplify that:\n\ng_Moon = (G * m_Earth / 80) / (r_Earth\u00b2 / 16)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\ng_Moon = (G * m_Earth / 80) * (16 / r_Earth\u00b2)\n\nSo, g_Moon = (16 / 80) * (G * m_Earth / r_Earth\u00b2)\n\nWhich is g_Moon = (1/5) * g_Earth\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me double-check that calculation.\n\nStarting again:\n\ng_Moon = G * (m_Earth / 80) / (r_Earth / 4)\u00b2\n\n= G * (m_Earth / 80) / (r_Earth\u00b2 / 16)\n\n= G * m_Earth / 80 * 16 / r_Earth\u00b2\n\n= (G * m_Earth / r_Earth\u00b2) * (16 / 80)\n\n= g_Earth * (1/5)\n\nYes, so g_Moon = (1/5) * g_Earth\n\nSo, the gravitational acceleration on the Moon is 1/5th that of Earth.\n\nNow, the weight of the box on the Moon would be W_Moon = m_box * g_Moon\n\nBut I also know that on Earth, W_Earth = m_box * g_Earth = 80 N\n\nSo, W_Moon = m_box * (1/5) * g_Earth\n\nBut m_box * g_Earth = 80 N\n\nTherefore, W_Moon = 80 N * (1/5) = 16 N\n\nSo, the answer should be 16 N.\n\nWait a minute, but looking back at the options, 16 N is one of the choices, but there's also 20 N, which is interesting.\n\nBut I think I did the calculation correctly. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the gravitational force between the box and the Moon.\n\nUsing F = G * (m_box * m_Moon) / r_Moon\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, on Earth, F = G * (m_box * m_Earth) / r_Earth\u00b2 = 80 N\n\nGiven m_Moon = m_Earth / 80 and r_Moon = r_Earth / 4\n\nSo, F_Moon = G * m_box * (m_Earth / 80) / (r_Earth / 4)\u00b2\n\n= G * m_box * m_Earth / 80 / (r_Earth\u00b2 / 16)\n\n= G * m_box * m_Earth / 80 * 16 / r_Earth\u00b2\n\n= (G * m_box * m_Earth / r_Earth\u00b2) * (16 / 80)\n\n= 80 N * (16 / 80)\n\n= 80 N * (1/5)\n\n= 16 N\n\nAgain, I get 16 N.\n\nLet me check if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there any other factor that could affect the weight of the box on the Moon besides the gravitational acceleration?\n\nI don't think so. Weight is essentially the gravitational force exerted on the object, so if the gravitational acceleration is 1/5th that of Earth, then the weight should indeed be 1/5th of 80 N, which is 16 N.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the surface gravity, which is proportional to G * m / r\u00b2, then with m_Moon being 1/80th of m_Earth and r_Moon being 1/4th of r_Earth, the surface gravity should be (1/80) / (1/4)\u00b2 = (1/80)/(1/16) = (16/80) = 1/5 times that of Earth's surface gravity.\n\nTherefore, the weight of the box on the Moon should be 1/5th of its weight on Earth, which is 16 N.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 16 N.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16\\ \\text{N}} \\]"
