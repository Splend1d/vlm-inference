                    "text": "So I've got this problem here with two statements about information theory and graph theory. I'm not entirely sure about these topics, but I'll try to figure them out step by step.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: For any two variables x and y having joint distribution p(x, y), we always have H[x, y] \u2265 H[x] + H[y], where H is the entropy function.\n\nHmm, entropy is a measure of uncertainty or randomness in information theory. I recall that for two random variables, the joint entropy H[X, Y] represents the total uncertainty of both variables together. There's also a relationship between joint entropy and individual entropies involving conditional entropies.\n\nLet me see... the joint entropy H[X, Y] can be expressed as H[X] + H[Y|X], where H[Y|X] is the conditional entropy of Y given X. Similarly, it can be written as H[Y] + H[X|Y].\n\nI think there's an inequality that relates joint entropy to the sum of individual entropies. Let's recall that for any two random variables, H[X, Y] \u2264 H[X] + H[Y]. Wait, is that right?\n\nActually, I think there's a formula that says H[X, Y] = H[X] + H[Y] - I[X;Y], where I[X;Y] is the mutual information between X and Y.\n\nMutual information measures the amount of information one random variable contains about another. It's always non-negative, and it's zero if and only if X and Y are independent.\n\nSo, H[X, Y] = H[X] + H[Y] - I[X;Y].\n\nGiven that I[X;Y] \u2265 0, then H[X, Y] \u2264 H[X] + H[Y].\n\nWait a minute, that's the opposite of what Statement 1 says. Statement 1 claims H[X, Y] \u2265 H[X] + H[Y], but according to this, H[X, Y] \u2264 H[X] + H[Y].\n\nSo, unless I'm missing something, it seems like Statement 1 is false.\n\nLet me double-check this. If X and Y are independent, then I[X;Y] = 0, and H[X, Y] = H[X] + H[Y].\n\nIf they are dependent, I[X;Y] > 0, so H[X, Y] < H[X] + H[Y].\n\nTherefore, in general, H[X, Y] \u2264 H[X] + H[Y], not \u2265.\n\nSo, Statement 1 is false.\n\nNow, moving on to Statement 2: For some directed graphs, moralization decreases the number of edges present in the graph.\n\nOkay, I'm less familiar with graph theory, especially moralization in the context of directed graphs.\n\nI believe moralization is a process used in converting a directed graph into an undirected one, which is useful in certain probabilistic graphical models, like Bayesian networks.\n\nThe process of moralization involves several steps:\n\n1. For each pair of nodes that have a common child, connect them with an undirected edge.\n\n2. Then, make all the edges undirected.\n\nThe purpose is to make the graph undirected while preserving certain conditional independence relationships.\n\nNow, the statement says that for some directed graphs, moralization decreases the number of edges.\n\nThat seems counterintuitive at first glance because moralization involves adding edges between parents of common children.\n\nBut maybe in some cases, the number of edges decreases overall.\n\nLet me think about this with an example.\n\nConsider a simple directed graph with three nodes: A \u2192 B \u2190 C.\n\nIn this graph, A and C are not directly connected, but they both have a common child B.\n\nDuring moralization, we would add an edge between A and C, making the graph look like A - B - C, with A - C.\n\nSo, in this case, moralization increases the number of edges from 2 to 3.\n\nBut maybe there are other graphs where moralization decreases the number of edges.\n\nLet's consider another example.\n\nTake a directed graph with four nodes: A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D.\n\nHere, there are no nodes with multiple parents, so no additional edges need to be added during moralization.\n\nAfter moralization, all edges become undirected: A - B - C - D.\n\nThe number of edges remains the same, which is 3.\n\nIs there a scenario where moralization decreases the number of edges?\n\nLet me think about a graph where there are multiple directed paths between nodes.\n\nSuppose we have A \u2192 B \u2190 C and A \u2192 D \u2190 C.\n\nIn this case, before moralization, we have four edges: A\u2192B, C\u2192B, A\u2192D, C\u2192D.\n\nAfter moralization, we connect parents of common children.\n\nHere, B has parents A and C, so we add A - C.\n\nSimilarly, D has parents A and C, so we add A - C if it's not already there.\n\nWait, A - C is already added from B's parents.\n\nSo, the undirected graph would have edges: A - B, B - C, A - D, C - D, A - C.\n\nThat's five edges, which is more than the original four.\n\nAgain, moralization increased the number of edges.\n\nMaybe in a graph where there are redundant edges, moralization could reduce the number of edges.\n\nConsider a directed graph with A \u2192 B, B \u2192 C, and A \u2192 C.\n\nHere, before moralization, we have three edges.\n\nAfter moralization, since B has only one parent, no new edges are added.\n\nSo, the undirected graph would have A - B, B - C, and A - C.\n\nSame number of edges.\n\nI can't seem to find a scenario where moralization decreases the number of edges.\n\nPerhaps the statement is incorrect, or maybe I'm missing something about the process of moralization.\n\nWait, maybe in a graph where there are multiple edges between the same pair of nodes, moralization could consolidate them.\n\nBut in standard graph theory, multiple edges between the same pair are generally not allowed in simple graphs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some contexts, moralization can lead to edge removal if certain conditions are met.\n\nHowever, based on my understanding, moralization typically involves adding edges rather than removing them.\n\nTherefore, it seems that moralization does not decrease the number of edges in a graph; rather, it may keep the same number or increase it by adding edges between parents of common children.\n\nHence, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Statement 1: False\n\n- Statement 2: False\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. False, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
