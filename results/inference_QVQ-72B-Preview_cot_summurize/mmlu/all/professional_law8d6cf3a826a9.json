                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario here about a grandfather who tripped on a toy left by his grandson and got severely injured. Now, they're in court, and both the grandfather and the son have moved for judgment as a matter of law regarding liability. The jurisdiction doesn't have intra-family immunity anymore and follows the traditional rules of landowner liability. I need to figure out what the court should do with these motions.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a judgment as a matter of law is. I think it's when the court decides the case based on the law itself, without needing a jury to decide on the facts, usually because the facts are not in dispute or one side has no legal basis for their claim.\n\nSo, in this case, both the grandfather and the son are asking the court to decide liability without going to a jury. The question is, should the court grant either motion, or should it let the jury decide?\n\nLet me think about the facts. The grandfather regularly visits his son's home and knows that the grandson leaves toys around. The son hasn't warned the grandfather to look out for toys. The grandfather trips on a toy and gets hurt badly.\n\nNow, the grandfather is suing his son for his injuries. The jurisdiction has abolished intra-family immunity, which I believe means that family members can sue each other for negligence, unlike in some places where there might be immunity based on family relationships.\n\nThe jurisdiction applies traditional rules of landowner liability. So, I need to recall what those rules are. Generally, landowners have certain duties to invitees, licensees, and trespassers. Since the grandfather is a regular visitor, I think he would be considered an invitee or a licensee.\n\nAn invitee is someone who is invited onto the property for a purpose related to the landowner's business, like customers in a store. A licensee is someone who is permitted to be on the property for their own convenience or enjoyment, like social guests. A trespasser is someone who enters without permission.\n\nIn this case, the grandfather is likely a licensee since he's visiting for social reasons.\n\nSo, what duties does the son owe to the grandfather? For licensees, landowners are generally required to warn of known dangers that aren't obvious and to exercise reasonable care to protect them from foreseeable harms.\n\nNow, the grandson regularly leaves toys around, and the grandfather is aware of this. So, is this a known danger that the son should have warned about?\n\nThe grandfather knows about the toys, but maybe he didn't expect them to be left on the floor where he could trip over them.\n\nWait, but he knows that toys are left scattered about the house. So, it's not like it's a surprise that toys are around. The issue is that he tripped on one left on the floor.\n\nSo, the question is whether the son had a duty to warn the grandfather about the risk of toys being left on the floor, especially since the grandfather already knows about the habit.\n\nAlso, was the toy left in a place where it was likely to cause someone to trip, and was it foreseeable that someone could get hurt because of it?\n\nI think the son might argue that since the grandfather knows about the toys, it's his responsibility to watch where he steps. The son might also say that he can't be expected to clean up after the child every minute, especially since the grandfather is an adult and should be cautious.\n\nOn the other hand, the grandfather might argue that the son should have taken more precautions to ensure the house is safe for visitors, especially knowing that toys are left around.\n\nBut, since the grandfather is aware of the situation, maybe he assumed the risk by entering the house without taking extra care.\n\nWait, but assuming the risk typically requires that the person knows of the danger and voluntarily chooses to accept it. Here, the grandfather knows that toys are left around, but did he know specifically that there was a risk of tripping over them on the floor?\n\nMaybe, since he's been there before and presumably hasn't tripped before, he might not have considered it a significant risk.\n\nBut, the son could argue that it's a common-sense thing to watch your step in a house with a young child.\n\nI need to think about whether the son had a duty to warn the grandfather about the risk of toys being left on the floor.\n\nIn negligence law, there needs to be a duty of care, a breach of that duty, causation, and damages.\n\nThe son owes a duty to his guests to maintain the property in a reasonably safe condition. For licensees, this typically includes warning of known dangers that aren't obvious and that the landowner should reasonably expect could cause harm.\n\nHere, the son knows that the grandson leaves toys around. Is that a known danger? And is it something that the son should reasonably expect could cause harm?\n\nWell, toys left on the floor can be tripping hazards, especially if they're small or placed in walkways.\n\nBut, the grandfather is aware of the toys being around, so perhaps the danger is obvious to him.\n\nWait, but sometimes, even if a danger is obvious, the landowner still has a duty to take reasonable steps to mitigate the risk.\n\nHowever, in this case, it's not like the son intentionally left the toy there or was negligent in cleaning up.\n\nThe toy was left by the grandson, who is a child, and it's not clear whether the son knew that the toy was left on the floor at the time of the accident.\n\nIf the son didn't know that the toy was on the floor, then it's hard to say that he breached his duty to maintain the property safely.\n\nUnless, perhaps, there's a pattern of toys being left in hazardous places, and the son should have taken more preventive measures.\n\nBut, the scenario says that the grandson routinely leaves toys scattered about the house. So, it's a recurring issue.\n\nPerhaps the son should have been more diligent in ensuring that toys are picked up after the child, especially in areas where people walk.\n\nBut, again, the grandfather knows about this habit, so maybe he should have been more careful.\n\nThis seems like a case where both parties have some responsibility.\n\nThe son has a duty to maintain a safe environment for his guests, but the grandfather also has a responsibility to be cautious, especially in a home with young children.\n\nNow, considering that, should the court grant judgment as a matter of law to either side?\n\nJudgment as a matter of law is appropriate when there are no material facts in dispute and the law clearly favors one side.\n\nHere, there seem to be disputed facts about whether the son knew about the specific danger, whether he took reasonable steps to prevent it, and whether the grandfather assumed the risk by entering the house knowing about the toys.\n\nSo, maybe it's not clear-cut enough for the court to decide without a jury.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the court can decide based on the law that the son had no duty to warn about the risk of toys being left on the floor because it's an open and obvious danger.\n\nBut, I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nLet me look up the concept of \"open and obvious dangers\" in landowner liability.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, landowners are not required to warn invitees or licensees of open and obvious dangers because it's assumed that reasonable people will recognize and avoid them.\n\nSo, if the danger is obvious, like a toy on the floor, then the landowner may not be liable.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to this rule, such as when the landowner should anticipate that people might not notice the danger despite it being obvious.\n\nAlso, for children, the standards might be different because they might not recognize dangers as easily.\n\nBut in this case, we're dealing with an adult grandfather.\n\nSo, perhaps the danger of tripping over a toy is considered open and obvious to an adult.\n\nTherefore, the son might not have a duty to warn the grandfather about it.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the grandfather didn't consider the risk significant enough to warrant extra caution.\n\nBut, in law, if the danger is open and obvious, the landowner may not be liable.\n\nSo, perhaps the son's motion for judgment as a matter of law should be granted based on the open and obvious danger doctrine.\n\nBut, I need to consider if there are other factors at play.\n\nFor example, was the toy left in a place where it was particularly hazardous, and the son should have foreseen that?\n\nOr, did the son have a history of being negligent in cleaning up after the child, putting guests at risk?\n\nThe scenario doesn't specify that the son was aware of the toy being on the floor at the time of the accident.\n\nIf the son didn't know about the toy, it's hard to say he breached his duty to maintain the property safely.\n\nUnless, perhaps, there's a higher duty to supervise the child and prevent such hazards.\n\nBut, supervising a four-year-old is challenging, and it's not realistic to expect the son to constantly clean up after the child.\n\nMaybe the court would consider that the son had a duty to take reasonable steps to prevent hazards caused by the child, but that he fulfilled that duty as much as reasonably possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the court would consider that the grandfather assumed the risk by entering the house knowing about the toys.\n\nAssumption of risk is a defense in negligence cases where the plaintiff knew of the danger and voluntarily chose to expose themselves to it.\n\nHere, the grandfather knew that toys were left around, so perhaps he assumed the risk of tripping over them.\n\nBut, again, assuming the risk typically requires that the plaintiff appreciated the risk and voluntarily accepted it.\n\nDid the grandfather appreciate the risk of tripping over toys left on the floor?\n\nMaybe not fully, or perhaps he thought it was a minor risk.\n\nBut, as an adult, he should be aware of such risks.\n\nSo, perhaps the son's motion should be granted based on the assumption of risk by the grandfather.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there are any exceptions or if the jurisdiction recognizes assumption of risk in these circumstances.\n\nAlso, maybe the grandfather can argue that the son was grossly negligent or that there was some other factor that makes the son liable.\n\nBut, the scenario doesn't provide information suggesting gross negligence.\n\nSo, based on the information given, it seems that the son had no duty to warn about the risk of toys being left on the floor, as it's an open and obvious danger to an adult like the grandfather.\n\nTherefore, the court should grant the son's motion for judgment as a matter of law, dismissing the grandfather's claim.\n\nWait, but the options include denying both motions and submitting the case to the jury based on negligence or strict liability.\n\nOption A says deny both motions and submit to the jury based on negligence.\n\nOption B says deny both motions and submit to the jury based on strict liability.\n\nOption C says grant the grandfather's motion because the son is liable as a matter of law for failing to warn about the risk of toys being left on the floor.\n\nOption D says grant the son's motion because the son had no duty to warn that the grandson might leave toys on the floor.\n\nBased on my analysis, I think Option D is the correct one.\n\nThe son had no duty to warn the grandfather about the open and obvious danger of toys being left on the floor, especially since the grandfather was aware of the habit.\n\nTherefore, the court should grant the son's motion for judgment as a matter of law.\n\nBut, I need to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nPerhaps there's an argument for strict liability here, but I don't think so.\n\nStrict liability typically applies to ultra-hazardous activities or abnormally dangerous conditions, which leaving toys on the floor doesn't seem to qualify as.\n\nSo, Option B is probably incorrect.\n\nOption A suggests submitting the case to the jury based on negligence, which might be appropriate if there are disputed facts, but in this case, it seems that the legal issue is clear.\n\nSimilarly, Option C suggests that the grandfather's motion should be granted, but I don't see a basis for that.\n\nThe grandfather is claiming that the son is liable for not warning him about the risk, but as I've thought, it's an open and obvious danger, and the grandfather was aware of it.\n\nTherefore, I don't think the grandfather's motion should be granted.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the court should grant the son's motion for judgment as a matter of law, based on the lack of duty to warn about an open and obvious danger.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
