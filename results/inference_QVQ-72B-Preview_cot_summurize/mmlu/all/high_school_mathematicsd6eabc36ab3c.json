                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that if a equals 7 and b equals 13, what's the number of even positive integers that are less than a times b? And the options are 45, 46, 90, or 180.\n\nFirst, I need to find what a times b is. So, a is 7 and b is 13. Let me calculate that: 7 multiplied by 13 is 91. So, we're looking for even positive integers less than 91.\n\nNow, I need to find how many even numbers are there that are less than 91. An even number is any integer that's divisible by 2, right? And since we're dealing with positive integers, we'll start from 2, 4, 6, and so on, up to the largest even number less than 91.\n\nWait a minute, what's the largest even number less than 91? Well, 90 is less than 91, and it's even, so that should be the largest one.\n\nSo, the even numbers less than 91 are 2, 4, 6, all the way up to 90.\n\nNow, to find out how many even numbers there are, I can think of this as a sequence starting from 2, increasing by 2 each time, up to 90.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1 is 2, the common difference d is 2, and the last term an is 90.\n\nI remember that the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula:\n\nn = (an - a1)/d + 1\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nn = (90 - 2)/2 + 1 = 88/2 + 1 = 44 + 1 = 45\n\nSo, there are 45 even positive integers less than 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of it differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the even numbers less than 91 start at 2 and go up to 90, inclusive.\n\nI can list them: 2, 4, 6, ..., 90.\n\nThis is similar to the sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., 45, where each term in my original sequence is twice these numbers.\n\nSo, 2*1 = 2, 2*2 = 4, ..., 2*45 = 90.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, there are 45 terms in this sequence.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that every second number is even, but since we're starting from 2 and going up by 2 each time, it's still 45 numbers.\n\nWait, but let's think about the total number of positive integers less than 91. That would be 1 through 90.\n\nTotal numbers: 90.\n\nHalf of them should be even, right? Because even and odd numbers alternate.\n\nSo, 90 divided by 2 is 45. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nBut hold on, is that always true? Well, for numbers starting from 1 up to an even number, yes, it should be exactly half even and half odd.\n\nSince 90 is even, it's perfect. If it were an odd number, like 91, which is odd, then 91 divided by 2 is 45.5, so still 45 even numbers and 46 odd numbers.\n\nBut in this case, since we're dealing with numbers less than 91, and 91 is odd, the number just below it is 90, which is even.\n\nSo, the count should indeed be 45 even numbers.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to confirm this.\n\nSuppose I want to find all even numbers less than 91.\n\nI can write them as 2, 4, 6, ..., 90.\n\nThis is an arithmetic progression with first term 2, common difference 2, and last term 90.\n\nThe number of terms n can be found using the formula for arithmetic sequences:\n\nn = (an - a1)/d + 1\n\nPlugging in:\n\nn = (90 - 2)/2 + 1 = 88/2 + 1 = 44 + 1 = 45\n\nAgain, confirming that there are 45 even numbers less than 91.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that these even numbers form a sequence where each term can be represented as 2k, where k starts from 1 and goes up to some m.\n\nSo, 2k < 91 \u21d2 k < 45.5\n\nSince k is a positive integer, k can be from 1 to 45 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, there are 45 values of k, hence 45 even numbers less than 91.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer should be 45.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 45\n\nB. 46\n\nC. 90\n\nD. 180\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation.\n\nMaybe the problem is trying to trick me by implying something else.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the number of even positive integers less than ab.\"\n\nGiven a=7 and b=13, ab=91.\n\nEven positive integers less than 91.\n\nWe've consistently gotten 45 as the answer.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider zero? No, zero is not positive.\n\nAre there any negative even numbers? No, the problem specifies positive integers.\n\nSo, no, zero and negative numbers are out.\n\nTherefore, 45 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and each method confirms the initial result.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
