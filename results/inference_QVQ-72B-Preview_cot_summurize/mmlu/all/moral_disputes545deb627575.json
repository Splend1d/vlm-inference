There should be no standards for safety.\n\nB. SCNT should not be allowed unless a healthy baby could be guaranteed.\n\nC. SCNT should be allowed when it falls within the range of risks that is accepted by ordinary people in sexual reproduction.\n\nD. None of the above.\n\nFirst off, I need to make sure I understand what SCNT is. SCNT stands for Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer, which is a technique used in cloning where the nucleus from a donor cell is transferred to an enucleated egg cell to create an embryo that can then develop into a clone of the donor organism.\n\nNow, Pence is likely referring to Mike Pence, who has been involved in political discussions regarding stem cell research and cloning. But since the question doesn't specify who Pence is, I'll assume it's a general reference to someone holding a particular view on SCNT safety standards.\n\nOption A suggests no safety standards should be in place. That seems extreme and unlikely to be a position held by someone like Pence, who is known for conservative views, especially regarding ethical considerations in scientific research.\n\nOption B says that SCNT shouldn't be allowed unless a healthy baby can be guaranteed. This seems overly cautious and perhaps impractical, as even in natural reproduction, there's no guarantee of a healthy baby. However, someone with strong ethical concerns about cloning might advocate for high safety standards.\n\nOption C suggests that SCNT should be allowed when its risks are within the range accepted by ordinary people in sexual reproduction. This seems reasonable, as it compares the risks of SCNT to those of natural reproduction, which is a common benchmark.\n\nGiven Pence's known positions on stem cell research and cloning, I recall that he has expressed concerns about the ethical implications of cloning and has supported restrictions on certain types of stem cell research. So, he might lean towards stricter safety standards.\n\nBetween options B and C, option B seems more stringent, requiring a guarantee of a healthy baby, which is almost impossible to achieve in any reproductive technology. Option C, on the other hand, accepts that some risk is inherent in reproduction, whether natural or through SCNT, and aims to ensure that SCNT's risks are comparable to those of natural reproduction.\n\nI think Pence would likely support option C, which sets a standard comparable to natural reproduction's risks, as it balances ethical concerns with scientific advancement.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's any direct quote or specific stance from Pence on this matter. Since the question doesn't provide that, I'll go with my analysis.\n\nSo, my answer is C. SCNT should be allowed when it falls within the range of risks that is accepted by ordinary people in sexual reproduction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
