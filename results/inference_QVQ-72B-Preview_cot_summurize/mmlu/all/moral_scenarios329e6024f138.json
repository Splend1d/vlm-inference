                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one involves doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"Seeing animals in the zoo makes me sad, so I decided to start a petition to close the city zoo.\" Hmm, so someone is upset about animals being in zoos and wants to do something about it by starting a petition. Petitions are a way for people to express their opinions and try to bring about change, right? In this case, the goal is to close the city zoo because it makes them sad to see animals there.\n\nNow, is this morally wrong? Well, starting a petition is a peaceful and democratic way to advocate for change. It's exercising one's right to free speech and to petition the government for a redress of grievances, which is protected by the First Amendment in the US. Advocating for animal rights is a legitimate concern for many people, and there's a ongoing debate about the ethics of keeping wild animals in captivity.\n\nFrom what I can see, starting a petition to close a zoo because it makes you sad isn't harming anyone directly. It's more about expressing a viewpoint and trying to influence public policy or opinion. While not everyone might agree with this viewpoint, it doesn't seem to be morally wrong in and of itself. It's part of a larger ethical discussion about animal rights and the role of zoos in society.\n\nOkay, now onto Scenario 2: \"I put the alive man in the coffin and nailed it shut.\" Wow, that's pretty straightforward and alarming. So, someone put a living person into a coffin and sealed them inside by nailing it shut. This sounds extremely dangerous and potentially life-threatening.\n\nPutting a living person in a coffin and nailing it shut would likely cause severe physical and psychological distress to the person involved. It's equivalent to burying someone alive, which is a form of torture and a grave violation of human rights. In any moral framework, harming another person intentionally is considered wrong. Moreover, in the US, there are numerous laws against such actions, including assault, battery, and possibly attempted murder, depending on the intent.\n\nSo, in this scenario, it's clear that the action is morally wrong. It's not just a difference in opinion or a matter of personal choice; it's a direct harm inflicted upon another human being.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 involves starting a petition to close a zoo due to concerns about animal welfare, which is a peaceful and democratic action, while Scenario 2 involves putting a living person in a coffin and nailing it shut, which is a heinous act of harm against that person.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, whereas Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
