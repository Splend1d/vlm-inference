                    "text": "So I need to figure out which of these options would lead to a decrease in the money supply. I'm not super familiar with monetary policy, but I think I can work through this with what I know.\n\nOption A says that the Fed lowers the discount rate. Hmm, the discount rate is the interest rate that the Federal Reserve charges banks for short-term loans, right? If the Fed lowers this rate, I would think that banks are more likely to borrow money because it's cheaper for them. That might actually lead to more money in the system as banks lend out more, which would increase the money supply, not decrease it. So, maybe this isn't the correct choice.\n\nOption B mentions that the Fed sells government securities in the secondary market. I recall that when the Fed wants to manage the money supply, it can buy or sell government bonds. If it buys bonds, it injects money into the economy, and if it sells bonds, it takes money out of the economy. So, selling government securities would mean that the Fed is taking money out of the system, which should decrease the money supply. This seems like a possible answer.\n\nOption C says that the federal government spends less money. Now, I know that fiscal policy can affect the economy. If the government spends less, that might reduce aggregate demand, which could lead to lower economic activity and potentially less money circulating in the economy. But I'm not entirely sure how directly this affects the money supply. Maybe it's indirectly related.\n\nOption D states that the Fed lowers reserve requirements. Reserve requirements are the amount of money that banks have to keep in reserve and can't lend out. If the Fed lowers these requirements, banks can lend out more money, which should increase the money supply through the multiplier effect. So, this would probably lead to an increase in the money supply, not a decrease.\n\nBased on my reasoning, option B seems to be the correct choice because selling government securities by the Fed would lead to a decrease in the money supply. Let me just double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nWhen the Fed sells government securities, it's essentially selling bonds to investors, who pay money to the Fed in exchange for those bonds. This transaction removes money from circulation in the economy, which directly decreases the money supply. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nOption A, lowering the discount rate, actually makes it cheaper for banks to borrow, which could encourage more lending and thus increase the money supply.\n\nOption C, if the government spends less, might affect the money supply indirectly through changes in aggregate demand and tax collections, but it's not as direct a relationship as with monetary policy tools like selling securities.\n\nOption D, lowering reserve requirements, definitely increases the money supply because banks can lend out more money, which multiplies through the banking system.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I'm confident that option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
