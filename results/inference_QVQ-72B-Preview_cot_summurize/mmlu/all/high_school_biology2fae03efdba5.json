                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question about ferns and some options: fallow deer, fruit flies, grass, or spotted toads. The question is asking which of these is likely to exhibit the process described in the scenario. So, first, I need to understand what's happening with the ferns.\n\nThe researcher is growing ferns in the lab, and after a few generations, a new variant with a distinct phenotype appears. When she tries to breed this new variant with the original phenotype, no offspring are produced. But when she breeds the new variants with each other, they produce offspring that look like the new variant.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a situation where a new species is forming. Maybe speciation is happening here. Speciation is when one species splits into two or more species over time. There are different ways this can happen, like allopatric speciation where populations are geographically isolated, or sympatric speciation where new species form without geographic barriers.\n\nIn this case, since all this is happening in the lab, I doubt there's any geographic isolation. So, it might be some form of sympatric speciation. But, in plants like ferns, which can reproduce both sexually and asexually, things might be a bit different.\n\nFerns are interesting because they can produce spores asexually, which can develop into new plants without mating. But in this scenario, it's mentioned that the researcher is breeding them, which suggests sexual reproduction.\n\nSo, perhaps the new variant has some genetic change that makes it reproductively isolated from the original population. Reproductive isolation means that even if two populations live in the same area, they can't interbreed and produce fertile offspring.\n\nIn the scenario, the new variant can't produce offspring when crossed with the original phenotype, but can produce offspring when crossed with each other. That sounds like reproductive isolation.\n\nNow, I need to see which of the given options\u2014fallow deer, fruit flies, grass, or spotted toads\u2014is most likely to exhibit this kind of process.\n\nLet's think about each one:\n\nA. Fallow deer: Deer are mammals, and speciation in mammals can occur through various means, but it's usually a slow process requiring long periods of isolation. In lab settings, it's unlikely to observe speciation in such a short time frame, especially in large animals like deer.\n\nB. Fruit flies: These are small insects, commonly used in genetic research because they have short generation times and produce many offspring. Speciation in fruit flies has been studied in labs, and it's possible to induce reproductive isolation through selective breeding or other experimental methods.\n\nC. Grass: Grasses are plants, like ferns, and can exhibit speciation through polyploidy, where the number of chromosome sets increases, leading to reproductive isolation. However, the scenario with ferns seems more related to genetic changes leading to reproductive barriers, possibly without polyploidy.\n\nD. Spotted toads: Toads are amphibians, and while speciation occurs in amphibians, it's generally a process that occurs over longer time scales and requires geographical or ecological separation.\n\nGiven that the scenario involves ferns, which are plants, and considering the options, grass is also a plant. So, perhaps grass would be the most similar in terms of reproductive mechanisms.\n\nBut, I need to consider which of these is most likely to exhibit the described process in a lab setting.\n\nFruit flies are well-known for their use in genetic experiments and have been subjected to various speciation studies in labs. Their short generation time and high reproductive rates make them ideal for observing evolutionary changes quickly.\n\nOn the other hand, grasses have longer generation times and might not show such changes as rapidly in a lab setting.\n\nTherefore, fruit flies seem like the most plausible choice here.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"which of the following is likely to exhibit the process described earlier?\" The process being speciation through reproductive isolation in a lab setting over a few generations.\n\nFruit flies are often used in such experiments because they can be easily bred in labs and have short generation times, allowing researchers to observe evolutionary changes quickly.\n\nFallow deer and spotted toads have much longer generation times and larger sizes, making them less suitable for lab experiments involving speciation.\n\nGrass, while it can be grown in labs, might not exhibit speciation in the same way as ferns do, especially in such a short time frame.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B. Fruit flies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
