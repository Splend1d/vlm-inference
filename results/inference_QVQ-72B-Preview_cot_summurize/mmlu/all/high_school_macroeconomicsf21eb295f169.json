                    "text": "So I have this question here about the GDP deflator. It says that if nominal GDP is $5000 and real GDP is $4000, then what's the GDP deflator? The options are A. 125, B. 1.25, C. 800, and D. 0.8.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to remember what the GDP deflator is. I know that the GDP deflator is a measure of inflation in an economy, and it's calculated using nominal GDP and real GDP. Nominal GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced in a country at current market prices, while real GDP is adjusted for inflation, reflecting the value at constant prices.\n\nThe formula for the GDP deflator is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{GDP Deflator} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Nominal GDP}}{\\text{Real GDP}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{GDP Deflator} = \\left( \\frac{5000}{4000} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( 1.25 \\right) \\times 100 = 125\n\\]\n\nOkay, so that gives me 125. Looking back at the options, A. 125 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure I understand what this number means. The GDP deflator of 125 suggests that the nominal GDP is 125% of the real GDP. In other words, prices have increased by 25% from the base year to the current year.\n\nLet me double-check if there's another way to look at this. Maybe I should consider the base year and what the deflator represents.\n\nSuppose the base year is when real GDP equals nominal GDP. In that case, the deflator would be 100. But here, nominal GDP is higher than real GDP, so the deflator is above 100, which makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might confuse the GDP deflator with the inflation rate or other similar concepts, but in this case, the question is straightforward, asking directly for the GDP deflator.\n\nLet me see if there's another formula or perhaps a different approach to calculate the GDP deflator. Maybe using the chain-weighted method or something, but no, that's more complicated, and the question seems to be using the standard formula.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that the units are different or that I need to consider the year or anything like that? The question doesn't specify the year, so I think it's safe to assume that the formula applies directly.\n\nAnother thing I should consider is whether the real GDP is in constant dollars or not. Usually, real GDP is adjusted to a base year's dollars, and nominal GDP is in current dollars. Given that, the calculation should hold.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the formula to see if I get the same answer. If I think about the deflator as a measure of how much nominal GDP has inflated compared to real GDP, then yes, dividing nominal by real and multiplying by 100 gives the percentage.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the deflator is expressed as an index number, with the base year being 100. But in this case, since we don't have a specified base year, I think the standard formula applies.\n\nI should also consider if there's any trick here, like the units being in thousands or millions, but the question specifies $5000 and $4000, so I assume those are in the same units.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers again to be absolutely sure:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5000}{4000} = 1.25\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\n1.25 \\times 100 = 125\n\\]\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 125\n\nB. 1.25\n\nC. 800\n\nD. 0.8\n\nOption A seems correct.\n\nWait, but option B is 1.25, which is the ratio before multiplying by 100. So, if someone forgets to multiply by 100, they might choose B. But that's not correct; the formula clearly says to multiply by 100 to get the deflator as an index.\n\nOption C is 800, which would be the result if you mistakenly divided real GDP by nominal GDP and then multiplied by 100:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4000}{5000} \\times 100 = 0.8 \\times 100 = 80\n\\]\n\nBut that's not the case, as the correct formula is nominal divided by real, not the other way around.\n\nOption D is 0.8, which is similar to the previous mistake.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is indeed A. 125.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider an example. Suppose the base year has a GDP of $4000, and the current year has nominal GDP of $5000 and real GDP adjusted to base year prices is still $4000. Then, the deflator would be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5000}{4000} \\times 100 = 125\n\\]\n\nWhich means prices have increased by 25% since the base year.\n\nAlternatively, if the real GDP was higher than nominal, the deflator would be less than 100, indicating deflation, but in this case, nominal is higher than real, so the deflator is above 100.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and I'm confident that the correct answer is A. 125.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 125} \\]"
