From what I remember, implicit memory involves skills and habits that we've learned over time, often without consciously thinking about them. It's like muscle memory or procedural knowledge. So, it's about doing something automatically because we've practiced it so much.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one to see which one fits this description.\n\nOption A: Describing the taste of the cake at your last birthday party. Hmm, this seems more like a sensory memory, maybe an episodic memory since it's tied to a specific event. It's about recalling a particular experience, not about performing a skill or habit. So, probably not an example of implicit memory.\n\nOption B: Remembering how to tie a tie. Now, this sounds like a skill that you've learned through repetition. Once you've tied a tie enough times, you can probably do it without really thinking about it. It's more of a procedural memory, which is a type of implicit memory. So, this seems like a good candidate.\n\nOption C: Recalling the name of your junior high school shop teacher. This is more like semantic memory, which is about facts and information, or possibly episodic memory if it's connected to a specific event. It's about remembering something you know, not about performing a skill. So, again, probably not an example of implicit memory.\n\nOption D: Recognizing a celebrity. This seems like it could be a case of familiarity or perhaps a type of explicit memory, where you consciously recall who someone is. It's not about performing a task or skill automatically, so I don't think it's an implicit memory.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option B\u2014remembering how to tie a tie\u2014seems to be the best example of an implicit memory. It's a skill that you've learned and can perform without consciously thinking about the steps, which is characteristic of implicit memory.\n\nJust to double-check, let me think about another way. Implicit memory is often contrasted with explicit memory, which involves conscious recall of information or events. So, if I look at the options in terms of whether they require conscious recall or not, it reinforces my earlier conclusion.\n\n- Option A: Describing a taste is more about recalling a sensory experience, which is explicit.\n\n- Option B: Tying a tie is a skill performed automatically, implying implicit memory.\n\n- Option C: Recalling a name is explicit recall of information.\n\n- Option D: Recognizing a celebrity is also explicit recognition.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer should be B. Remembering how to tie a tie.\n\nI think I'm confident with that choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
