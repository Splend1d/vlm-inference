                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about two random variables, X and Y, both discrete and defined on the positive integers. The probability that X equals n is 1/2^n for each positive integer n. Y has the same probability distribution as X, and X and Y are independent. I need to find the probability that at least one of them is greater than 3.\n\nFirst, I should understand what it means for X or Y to be greater than 3. Since they're both defined on positive integers, I guess n starts from 1 upwards. So, X can be 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, with probabilities 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, etc., respectively.\n\nSimilarly for Y.\n\nNow, the event that at least one of them is greater than 3 is the same as saying that either X > 3 or Y > 3, or both.\n\nProbability of at least one being greater than 3 can be found using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\nP(X > 3 or Y > 3) = P(X > 3) + P(Y > 3) - P(X > 3 and Y > 3)\n\nSince X and Y are independent, P(X > 3 and Y > 3) = P(X > 3) * P(Y > 3)\n\nSo, P(X > 3 or Y > 3) = P(X > 3) + P(Y > 3) - P(X > 3) * P(Y > 3)\n\nBut first, I need to find P(X > 3). Since X is a discrete random variable with probabilities 1/2^n for n = 1, 2, 3, ..., P(X > 3) is the sum of probabilities for n = 4, 5, 6, ...\n\nP(X > 3) = sum from n=4 to infinity of 1/2^n\n\nSimilarly, P(Y > 3) = sum from n=4 to infinity of 1/2^n, since Y has the same distribution as X.\n\nI know that sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/2^n is a geometric series with first term 1/2 and ratio 1/2, so sum is 1.\n\nTherefore, sum from n=4 to infinity of 1/2^n = sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/2^n - sum from n=1 to 3 of 1/2^n\n\nSum from n=1 to 3 of 1/2^n = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 = 7/8\n\nWait, no. Wait a minute. Sum from n=1 to 3 of 1/2^n is 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 = 7/8\n\nWait, no. Wait, sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/2^n is 1/2 / (1 - 1/2) = 1\n\nSum from n=1 to 3 of 1/2^n is 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 = 7/8\n\nTherefore, sum from n=4 to infinity of 1/2^n = 1 - 7/8 = 1/8\n\nSo, P(X > 3) = 1/8\n\nSimilarly, P(Y > 3) = 1/8\n\nTherefore, P(X > 3 or Y > 3) = P(X > 3) + P(Y > 3) - P(X > 3) * P(Y > 3) = 1/8 + 1/8 - (1/8)*(1/8) = 2/8 - 1/64 = (16/64 - 1/64) = 15/64\n\nSo, the answer should be 15/64, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, I can find the probability that both X and Y are less than or equal to 3, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nP(X \u2264 3 and Y \u2264 3) = P(X \u2264 3) * P(Y \u2264 3) = (7/8) * (7/8) = 49/64\n\nTherefore, P(X > 3 or Y > 3) = 1 - P(X \u2264 3 and Y \u2264 3) = 1 - 49/64 = 15/64\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that X can be greater than 3 and Y can be greater than 3 independently, and calculate accordingly, I should get the same result.\n\nSo, I think 15/64 is correct.\n\nWait, but option A is 1/64, which is P(X > 3) * P(Y > 3) = (1/8)*(1/8) = 1/64, but that's not what we want. We want P(X > 3 or Y > 3), which is P(X > 3) + P(Y > 3) - P(X > 3 and Y > 3) = 1/8 + 1/8 - 1/64 = 15/64.\n\nYes, so option B is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the complement again, P(neither X nor Y > 3) = P(X \u2264 3 and Y \u2264 3) = (7/8)^2 = 49/64, so P(at least one > 3) = 1 - 49/64 = 15/64.\n\nYes, I'm confident now.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 15/64"
