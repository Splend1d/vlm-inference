Tom and Jerry.\" Hmm, okay, let's see. I need to figure out which one of these isn't a pair of cartoon characters from TV.\n\nFirst, I know that a \"duo\" means a pair of two things, right? So, all of these options are pairs of names, but the question is which one isn't a TV cartoon duo.\n\nLet me start by looking at option A: Chip and Dale. I remember Chip and Dale from Disney cartoons. They are those two chipmunks, always getting into mischief. So, they are definitely cartoon characters, and they are a famous duo. So, they seem to fit the description.\n\nNext, option B: Beavis and Butt-head. I've heard of them too. They were characters from a show on MTV, I think. It was an animated show, and they were known for their silly behavior and catchphrases. So, they are also a cartoon duo.\n\nOption C: Simon and Garfunkel. Wait a minute, I know Simon and Garfunkel as a music duo, not cartoon characters. They were famous singers and songwriters, especially popular in the 1960s with hits like \"The Sound of Silence\" and \"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\" So, they are not cartoon characters; they are musicians.\n\nLastly, option D: Tom and Jerry. Of course, Tom and Jerry are iconic cartoon characters from a long-running series where Tom, the cat, constantly tries to catch Jerry, the mouse, but usually ends up getting into all sorts of hijinks. They are definitely a TV cartoon duo.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like Simon and Garfunkel are not a TV cartoon duo; they are a music duo. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C: Simon and Garfunkel.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. Maybe there's some trick here that I'm missing. Is there any possibility that Simon and Garfunkel could be considered cartoon characters in some context? I don't think so. They were real people, Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel, who were musicians, not animated characters.\n\nOn the other hand, Chip and Dale, Beavis and Butt-head, and Tom and Jerry are all animated characters from television shows. So, yeah, I think my answer stands.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other interpretation of the question. The term \"TV cartoon duo\" should be straightforward\u2014pairs of cartoon characters who are main figures in a television show.\n\nChip and Dale fit this description from their various appearances in Disney animated series.\n\nBeavis and Butt-head had their own animated show on MTV, which was quite popular in the 1990s.\n\nTom and Jerry are classics, having been around since the 1940s in theaters and later on television.\n\nSimon and Garfunkel, again, are musicians, not cartoon characters.\n\nSo, I don't see any reason to doubt that option C is the correct answer.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The answer is clearly option C: Simon and Garfunkel, as they are not a TV cartoon duo but a music duo.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
