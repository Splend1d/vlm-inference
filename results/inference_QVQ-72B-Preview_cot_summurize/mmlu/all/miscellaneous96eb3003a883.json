                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"The first sound recording to be made and reproduced was a recitation of what nursery rhyme?\" And the options are A. Humpty Dumpty, B. Mary Had a Little Lamb, C. Jack Be Nimble, and D. Home Sweet Home. Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out which one was the first to be recorded and reproduced.\n\nFirst off, I should probably know who invented sound recording and when that happened. I think Thomas Edison invented the phonograph, which was used to record sounds. Let me check that. Edison invented the phonograph in 1877, and it was used to record sounds onto cylinders. So, maybe the first recording was made around that time.\n\nNow, among these options, which nursery rhyme was recorded first? I need to find out what was the first sound recording ever made. Maybe it's the one that Edison himself recorded. Let me see if I can find that information.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that Edison's first successful phonograph could record and reproduce sound using tinfoil sheets wrapped around a grooved cylinder. The first recording he made was of himself reciting \"Mary Had a Little Lamb.\" Oh, that's one of the options here\u2014B. Mary Had a Little Lamb.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that this was indeed the first sound recording ever made. Maybe there were earlier attempts or other inventors who recorded different nursery rhymes.\n\nLet me look into the history of sound recording a bit more. I recall that there was another inventor named \u00c9douard-L\u00e9on Scott de Martinville who demonstrated a device called the phonautograph in 1857, which could record sounds but couldn't reproduce them. So, that wasn't a full-fledged recording device.\n\nThen, in 1877, Edison invented the phonograph, which could both record and reproduce sound. As I mentioned earlier, his first recording was of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb.\" That seems to be a widely accepted fact.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I'll check if any other nursery rhymes were recorded before that. For instance, \"Humpty Dumpty\" is another popular one, but I don't recall any early recordings associated with it. \"Jack Be Nimble\" also doesn't ring any bells in terms of early sound recordings.\n\n\"What?\" you might ask. Well, \"Home Sweet Home\" is a song, not exactly a nursery rhyme, but it's included as an option. Maybe it was recorded earlier, but I doubt it.\n\nWait a minute, \"Home Sweet Home\" is a song from the opera \"Clari, or The Maid of Milan,\" written by Henry Rowley Bishop in 1823. It became very popular, especially among Americans during the 19th century. But again, in terms of sound recordings, I think the phonograph was invented much later, in 1877.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems that \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" was the first nursery rhyme to be recorded and reproduced using Edison's phonograph in 1877.\n\nJust to cross-verify, I'll see if there's any other information that suggests otherwise. For example, perhaps there were earlier recordings of other nursery rhymes by different inventors or in other countries.\n\nAfter some more research, I find that indeed, Edison's recording of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" in 1877 is widely recognized as the first sound recording of a human voice. Moreover, the recording was made by speaking the words into a horn that vibrated a diaphragm, which then inscribed the sound waves onto a tinfoil sheet wrapped around a cylinder.\n\nInterestingly, the quality of these early recordings was quite poor, and the recordings were fragile and difficult to preserve. However, they marked a significant milestone in the history of audio technology.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, I can confidently say that the first sound recording to be made and reproduced was a recitation of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. Mary Had a Little Lamb}} \\]"
