Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these terms refers to a strong movement away from all religions.\n\nLet me start by understanding what each term means. I know that secularism is somehow related to separating religion from public life or government. But is it a movement away from all religions, or just keeping them separate from state affairs? Maybe I should look it up to be sure.\n\nSecularism, from what I recall, is the principle of separating church and state, meaning that religious institutions should not influence government decisions, and vice versa. It promotes religious freedom and neutrality in public affairs. So, it's more about separation rather than a movement away from religion altogether. Maybe it's not the best choice for this question.\n\nNext, heathenism. I think heathen refers to someone who is not a follower of a mainstream religion, like Christianity, Islam, or Judaism. In historical contexts, it was used to describe pagans or people who practice polytheistic religions. But that doesn't sound like a strong movement away from all religions. It seems more about following different belief systems rather than rejecting religion entirely.\n\nSacrilege sounds familiar; I think it has to do with disrespecting sacred things. Wait, according to my memory, sacrilege is the violation or profanation of something considered sacred or holy. So, it's more about showing disrespect towards sacred objects or spaces, not necessarily a movement away from all religions as a whole.\n\nLastly, nationalism. I know nationalism is a strong sense of national pride and loyalty to one's country, often emphasizing that one's own nation is superior to others. It can sometimes lead to conflicts between different nations or ethnic groups. But this seems unrelated to a movement away from all religions. Nationalism is more about national identity than religious beliefs.\n\nSo, none of these options seem to perfectly fit the description of a strong movement away from all religions. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps I should consider that some of these terms can have multiple meanings.\n\nLet me think again. Secularism does involve a separation of religion and state, which could imply a movement away from religious influence in public life. But it's not necessarily about rejecting religion entirely; it's more about keeping it private.\n\nHeathenism seems to refer to non-mainstream religious practices, so it's not about moving away from religion but perhaps practicing different ones.\n\nSacrilege is about desecrating sacred things, which is more about acts of disrespect rather than a broader movement against religion.\n\nNationalism is clearly about national pride and identity, not about religion.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the question is trying to trick me by not having the exact answer among the options. Or perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider that \"a strong movement away from all religions\" could also be referred to as atheism, which is the absence of belief in any deities or religions. But atheism isn't listed here. That makes me think that maybe the question is using \"secularism\" in a different sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe secularism can be seen as a movement that promotes a society where religion doesn't play a significant role in public life or governance. In that case, it could be considered a movement away from religious influence.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Let me see if I can find a definition that fits.\n\nUpon looking it up, secularism is defined as the principle of separation of the state from religious institutions or the elimination of a religion's influence in the affairs of the state. It advocates for a society in which public life and government are neutral on matters of belief and free from religious control.\n\nSo, while it promotes neutrality and freedom from religious control, it doesn't necessarily advocate for rejecting all religions on a personal level. It's more about public and governmental separation.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's not the best fit for a \"strong movement away from all religions.\"\n\nWhat about heathenism? As I understood earlier, it refers to those who practice non-mainstream religions, like paganism. That's moving towards different religions, not away from religion in general.\n\nSacrilege is an act of disrespect towards sacred things, not a movement against all religions.\n\nNationalism is about national identity and pride, unrelated to religion.\n\nMaybe the question is testing whether I can identify that none of the options perfectly fit the description. Or perhaps it's expecting me to choose secularism as the closest option, even though it's not entirely accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some contexts, secularism can be associated with a movement away from all religions, as it promotes a non-religious public sphere.\n\nBut I still feel unsure. Maybe I should go with secularism as the closest answer, acknowledging that it's not perfectly fitting but is the most relevant among the given options.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to choose one, I'd probably select A. secularism, but with the understanding that it's more about separation than a complete rejection of all religions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overthinking this. Maybe the question is simply testing knowledge of these terms and realizing that none of them perfectly fit the description provided.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the best answer is to recognize that none of the options accurately describe a strong movement away from all religions.\n\nBut since I have to choose one, I'll go with A. secularism, acknowledging that it's about reducing religious influence in public life, which could be seen as a movement away from religious involvement in society.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ secularism}} \\]"
