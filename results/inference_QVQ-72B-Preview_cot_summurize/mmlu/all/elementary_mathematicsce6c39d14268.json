                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about the Tranquility Inn's weekly milk order. They order 40 gallons of low-fat milk and 15 gallons of chocolate milk. The question is asking for the ratio of low-fat gallons to chocolate gallons. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio is. A ratio compares two quantities by division. It tells me how much of one thing there is relative to another. In this case, I have two quantities: low-fat milk and chocolate milk.\n\nSo, the amount of low-fat milk is 40 gallons, and the amount of chocolate milk is 15 gallons. The ratio should be 40 to 15. But ratios are usually expressed in their simplest form, like fractions.\n\nLet me try to simplify this ratio. To simplify 40:15, I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 40 and 15. The GCD is the largest number that divides both 40 and 15 without leaving a remainder.\n\nLet's find the GCD of 40 and 15.\n\nThe factors of 40 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40.\n\nThe factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, 15.\n\nThe common factors are 1 and 5. So, the greatest common divisor is 5.\n\nNow, I'll divide both numbers in the ratio by 5 to simplify.\n\n40 \u00f7 5 = 8\n\n15 \u00f7 5 = 3\n\nSo, the simplified ratio is 8:3.\n\nWait a minute, but looking at the options provided:\n\nA. 3:01\n\nB. 5:01\n\nC. 5:03\n\nD. 8:03\n\nI got 8:3, which is option D. But let's double-check if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nIs there any possibility that the ratio needs to be inverted or something? No, because the question clearly asks for the ratio of low-fat gallons to chocolate gallons, in that order.\n\nAlso, sometimes ratios can be written with colons or fractions, but here they're using colons, so 8:3 seems appropriate.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at it. Maybe checking the units. Both quantities are in gallons, so there's no issue with different units.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the ratio should be expressed in terms of total milk or not, but no, it's directly asking for the ratio between low-fat and chocolate milk.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. 8:03.\n\nWait, but why is it written as 8:03 instead of just 8:3? Maybe it's a matter of formatting. Perhaps the extra zero is for clarity, to indicate that it's 8 to 3.\n\nBut in standard mathematical notation, writing it as 8:3 is sufficient. Adding a zero before the 3 isn't necessary, but maybe the extra zero is just for visual consistency in the options.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 3:01\n\nB. 5:01\n\nC. 5:03\n\nD. 8:03\n\nSo, 8:03 corresponds to D, which matches my calculation.\n\nI think the correct choice is D. 8:03.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any trick here. Is there any possibility that the ratio changes based on the context provided earlier? For example, maybe there are multiple orders or something, but no, the problem seems straightforward.\n\nAlso, ratios are typically expressed in their simplest form, which I've done correctly as 8:3.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is D. 8:03.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
