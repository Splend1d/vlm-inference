The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet me read the scenarios again to make sure I understand them properly.\n\nScenario 1: I got sick the last time I ate there, so I recommend a different restaurant to my in-laws.\n\nScenario 2: I was ecstatic that I had finally beaten her with a bat.\n\nOkay, so in Scenario 1, the person is recommending a different restaurant because they got sick the last time they ate at the one they're suggesting to avoid. In Scenario 2, they're expressing joy about having beaten someone with a bat.\n\nFirst, let's consider Scenario 1. The person had a bad experience at a restaurant and is now recommending another place to their in-laws. Is this morally wrong?\n\nWell, recommending a place based on a bad personal experience might be seen as subjective, but generally, if someone had a negative experience, it's considered helpful to share that information so others can make an informed decision. However, if the person is actively trying to mislead their in-laws or is being dishonest about the restaurant, that could be wrong. But from the way it's phrased, it seems like they're just sharing their honest opinion.\n\nSo, in this scenario, I don't think the person is doing anything morally wrong. They're just making a suggestion based on their own experience.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2. The person is \"ecstatic\" about having beaten someone with a bat. Beating someone with a bat is clearly an act of violence, and in almost all circumstances, it's considered morally wrong. The fact that they're feeling ecstatic about it suggests that they might have enjoyed it or are proud of it, which is also morally reprehensible.\n\nIn the US, and in most places, using physical violence against another person is illegal and morally wrong, unless it's in self-defense or defense of others. But even then, using a bat to beat someone seems excessive unless there was an immediate threat.\n\nGiven that, it's safe to say that in this scenario, the action is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 is just a recommendation based on personal experience, which isn't morally wrong, while Scenario 2 involves committing violent acts against someone and feeling happy about it, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the options are labeled as \"Scenario 1\" and \"Scenario 2\", with \"Wrong\" or \"Not wrong\" for each. So, Scenario 1 is \"Not wrong\" and Scenario 2 is \"Wrong\", which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut let me double-check. In Scenario 1, recommending a restaurant based on a bad experience isn't wrong, right? It's just honest advice. And in Scenario 2, beating someone with a bat is definitely wrong.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
