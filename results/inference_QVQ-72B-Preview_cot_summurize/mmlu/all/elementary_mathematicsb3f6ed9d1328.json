                    "text": "So I have this problem here about finding the volume of a plastic case for storing baseball cards. The case has a length of 12 centimeters, a width of 6.5 centimeters, and a height of 1.25 centimeters. I need to find the volume in cubic centimeters, and there are four options to choose from: A. 39.5, B. 97.5, C. 118.5, or D. 202.25.\n\nOkay, first things first, I know that volume is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height of an object. So, volume (V) is equal to length (L) times width (W) times height (H). In mathematical terms, that's V = L \u00d7 W \u00d7 H.\n\nGiven that, I have L = 12 cm, W = 6.5 cm, and H = 1.25 cm. So, I should just multiply these together to get the volume.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nV = 12 cm \u00d7 6.5 cm \u00d7 1.25 cm\n\nNow, before I jump into multiplying, I should make sure that all the units are consistent. Since all the measurements are in centimeters, that's good. The result will be in cubic centimeters (cm\u00b3), which is what the question is asking for.\n\nAlright, time to multiply these numbers. Maybe I can make it easier by rearranging the order of multiplication. Let's see:\n\nFirst, multiply 12 and 6.5. 12 times 6 is 72, and then adding half of that since 6.5 is half way between 6 and 7. Half of 12 is 6, so 72 plus 6 is 78.\n\nSo, 12 \u00d7 6.5 = 78\n\nThen, multiply 78 by 1.25. Hmm, multiplying by 1.25 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So, 78 \u00d7 5/4.\n\nFirst, divide 78 by 4, which is 19.5, and then multiply by 5, which is 97.5.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 78 \u00d7 1.25. I know that 78 \u00d7 1 = 78, and 78 \u00d7 0.25 is 19.5, so adding those together: 78 + 19.5 = 97.5.\n\nSo, V = 97.5 cm\u00b3\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 97.5 is one of them.\n\nBut, just to be sure, maybe I should double-check my calculations.\n\nLet me try multiplying them in a different order. Maybe 6.5 \u00d7 1.25 first.\n\n6.5 \u00d7 1.25. Again, 6.5 \u00d7 1 = 6.5, and 6.5 \u00d7 0.25 = 1.625. So, 6.5 \u00d7 1.25 = 6.5 + 1.625 = 8.125\n\nThen, 12 \u00d7 8.125.\n\n12 \u00d7 8 = 96, and 12 \u00d7 0.125 = 1.5, so 96 + 1.5 = 97.5\n\nYes, same result again, 97.5 cm\u00b3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can convert all measurements to millimeters to see if it affects the answer, but since everything is in centimeters and I'm multiplying them directly, it shouldn't change the result.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the units. Since volume is length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height, and all dimensions are given, I don't think there's any trick here.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider whether the case has any thickness or if it's a hollow object, but the problem says it's a plastic case for storing baseball cards, so I assume it's a solid object with those outer dimensions, and I need the volume of the material itself.\n\nAlternatively, if it's a hollow case, I might need to subtract something, but the problem doesn't specify any wall thickness, so I think it's safe to assume it's a solid rectangular prism.\n\nTherefore, the volume should indeed be 97.5 cubic centimeters.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 39.5\n\nB. 97.5\n\nC. 118.5\n\nD. 202.25\n\nSo, option B seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the dimensions.\n\nPerhaps the height is not actually the height but another dimension, but no, the problem specifies length, width, and height, so I think the straightforward approach is correct.\n\nAlso, considering the order of multiplication doesn't matter, as multiplication is associative, so V = L \u00d7 W \u00d7 H will give the same result regardless of which two dimensions I multiply first.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. 97.5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 97.5} \\]"
