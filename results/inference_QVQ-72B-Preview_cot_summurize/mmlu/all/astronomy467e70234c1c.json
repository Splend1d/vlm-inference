                    "text": "So I have this question about Pluto's surface. It says that Pluto's extremely cold surface, about 40 Kelvin, is composed of:\n\nA. mainly water ice which always remains frozen\n\nB. nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide ices which sublimate into an atmosphere near perihelion\n\nC. nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide ices which always remain frozen\n\nD. roughly half ices and half rocky materials\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what Pluto is like. Pluto is a dwarf planet in our solar system, known for being one of the coldest places out there with a temperature around 40 Kelvin. At that temperature, most substances are frozen solid.\n\nOption A says mainly water ice which always remains frozen. I know that water ice can exist on Pluto, but I think there's more to its surface composition than just water ice.\n\nOption B mentions nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide ices which sublimate into an atmosphere near perihelion. Perihelion is when Pluto is closest to the Sun in its orbit. I remember that Pluto has an atmosphere that can freeze and thaw depending on its distance from the Sun.\n\nOption C is similar to B but says these ices always remain frozen. But I think that near perihelion, when Pluto is closer to the Sun, these ices can sublimate into gas, forming an atmosphere.\n\nOption D says roughly half ices and half rocky materials. Pluto is known to have a icy surface, but I'm not sure about the exact proportion of ices to rocky materials.\n\nI need to think about what Pluto's surface is mostly made of. From what I recall, Pluto has a thick crust composed primarily of water ice, but it also has other ices like nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide.\n\nWait, maybe it's a combination of both water ice and these other ices. But the question is asking for the main composition.\n\nLet me consider the temperatures involved. At 40 Kelvin, water ice would be frozen, as would nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide.\n\nBut I think that nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide can sublimate into gases when Pluto is near perihelion, which is when it's closest to the Sun and thus receives more solar energy.\n\nSo, option B suggests that these ices sublimate into an atmosphere near perihelion. That sounds plausible because Pluto is known to have an atmosphere that varies with its orbit.\n\nOption C says these ices always remain frozen, but that doesn't account for the observed atmosphere on Pluto, especially near perihelion.\n\nOption A mentions mainly water ice, but I think Pluto's surface has a variety of ices, not just water ice.\n\nOption D suggests roughly half ices and half rocky materials. While Pluto does have a rocky core, its surface is predominantly icy.\n\nWait, maybe the surface is mostly ices, with the interior having more rocky material.\n\nI need to look up some data on Pluto's composition.\n\nUpon checking, Pluto's composition is indeed mostly icy, with a significant portion being water ice, but also substantial amounts of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide ices.\n\nSo, option A says mainly water ice, but it seems that other ices are also prominent.\n\nOption B mentions nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide ices sublimating near perihelion, which aligns with what I know about Pluto's atmosphere.\n\nOption C contradicts that by saying these ices always remain frozen, which isn't accurate because we know Pluto has an atmosphere that forms and dissipates with its orbit.\n\nOption D suggests half ices and half rocky materials, but from what I can find, Pluto's surface is predominantly icy, with the rocky material more concentrated towards its core.\n\nTherefore, option B seems the most accurate because it correctly identifies the types of ices present on Pluto's surface and acknowledges that they can sublimate into an atmosphere near perihelion.\n\nWait, but is it true that these ices always sublimate near perihelion? Or is it only under certain conditions?\n\nFrom what I recall, Pluto's atmosphere forms and dissipates over its orbital period, which is about 248 Earth years. When it's closest to the Sun, the increased solar radiation causes the ices to sublimate, forming an atmosphere.\n\nBut does this happen every time it reaches perihelion, or are there variations?\n\nGiven that Pluto's orbit is elliptical, with distances ranging from about 2.8 to 4.6 billion miles from the Sun, the intensity of solar radiation varies significantly.\n\nTherefore, it's reasonable to assume that near perihelion, the ices do sublimate to some extent, forming an atmosphere.\n\nHowever, at aphelion, when it's farthest from the Sun, the atmosphere freezes back into the surface.\n\nSo, option B states that these ices sublimate into an atmosphere near perihelion, which seems accurate.\n\nOption C says they always remain frozen, which isn't the case near perihelion.\n\nOption A mentions mainly water ice, but as I said, other ices are significant components.\n\nOption D suggests a 50/50 split between ices and rocky materials, which might be more about the overall composition of Pluto rather than just its surface.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option B: nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide ices which sublimate into an atmosphere near perihelion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
