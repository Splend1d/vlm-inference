So, the question is asking which color is not considered to be one of the primary colors of light: red, yellow, green, or blue.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the primary colors of light actually are. I think in light, the primary colors are red, green, and blue. Yeah, that sounds familiar. So, if that's the case, then yellow would not be one of the primary colors of light.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I should think about how colors mix in light. I remember something about additive color mixing. In additive color mixing, when you combine different colored lights, you can create other colors. And the primary colors in additive mixing are red, green, and blue.\n\nSo, if I have red, green, and blue lights, and I overlap them, I can create white light. If I just overlap red and green, I get yellow; red and blue give me magenta; and green and blue give me cyan. So, yellow is actually a secondary color in this system because it's made by combining red and green.\n\nTherefore, the primary colors of light are red, green, and blue, and yellow is not one of them. So, the answer should be B. yellow.\n\nWait a minute, is there any system where yellow is considered a primary color? Maybe in some color models or something, but I don't think so in the context of light. In painting, it's different because in subtractive color mixing, the primary colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow, but that's for pigments, not for light.\n\nSo, yeah, in the context of light, the primary colors are red, green, and blue, and yellow is not a primary color. It's a secondary color created by mixing red and green light.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the options again:\n\nA. red - definitely a primary color of light.\n\nB. yellow - not a primary color of light.\n\nC. green - definitely a primary color of light.\n\nD. blue - definitely a primary color of light.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. yellow.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
