Hmm, first things first, I should probably find the critical points of the function by taking its derivative and setting it to zero.\n\nAlright, let's find f'(x). The function is f(x) = x * e^{-x}. Using the product rule, which is (u*v)' = u'v + uv', where u = x and v = e^{-x}.\n\nSo, u' = 1 and v' = -e^{-x}.\n\nTherefore, f'(x) = (1)(e^{-x}) + (x)(-e^{-x}) = e^{-x} - x e^{-x} = e^{-x}(1 - x).\n\nNow, set f'(x) = 0 to find critical points:\n\ne^{-x}(1 - x) = 0.\n\nSince e^{-x} is never zero, we have 1 - x = 0, which implies x = 1.\n\nSo, there's a critical point at x = 1.\n\nNow, to determine if this is a maximum, minimum, or neither, I can use the second derivative test.\n\nFirst, find f''(x).\n\nWe have f'(x) = e^{-x}(1 - x).\n\nThen, f''(x) = (e^{-x})'(1 - x) + (e^{-x})(-1) = -e^{-x}(1 - x) + (-e^{-x}) = -e^{-x}(1 - x + 1) = -e^{-x}(2 - x).\n\nNow, plug in x = 1 into f''(x):\n\nf''(1) = -e^{-1}(2 - 1) = -e^{-1}(1) = -1/e < 0.\n\nSince f''(1) is negative, the function has a local maximum at x = 1.\n\nNow, let's find f(1):\n\nf(1) = 1 * e^{-1} = 1/e.\n\nSo, the maximum value is 1/e.\n\nLooking back at the options, that's choice A.\n\nBut wait, I should check if this is indeed the absolute maximum or just a local maximum.\n\nLet me consider the behavior of f(x) as x approaches positive and negative infinity.\n\nAs x approaches +\u221e, e^{-x} approaches 0, and x approaches +\u221e, so f(x) approaches 0 * +\u221e, which is indeterminate. Wait, actually, e^{-x} approaches 0 faster than x approaches infinity, so f(x) approaches 0.\n\nAs x approaches -\u221e, e^{-x} approaches +\u221e, and x approaches -\u221e, so f(x) approaches -\u221e * +\u221e, which is negative infinity.\n\nTherefore, f(x) approaches -\u221e as x approaches -\u221e, and approaches 0 as x approaches +\u221e, with a local maximum at x = 1.\n\nTherefore, the absolute maximum is indeed at x = 1, and f(1) = 1/e.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 1/e.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check by graphing or plugging in some points.\n\nLet's pick x = 0: f(0) = 0 * e^{0} = 0.\n\nx = 1: f(1) = 1/e \u2248 0.3679.\n\nx = 2: f(2) = 2 * e^{-2} \u2248 2 * 0.1353 \u2248 0.2706, which is less than 1/e.\n\nx = -1: f(-1) = -1 * e \u2248 -2.718.\n\nx = 2/e \u2248 0.7358: f(2/e) = (2/e) * e^{-2/e} \u2248 (2/e) * e^{-0.7358} \u2248 (2/e) * 0.4724 \u2248 2 * 0.176 \u2248 0.352, which is less than 1/e.\n\nSo, it seems that f(1) = 1/e is indeed the maximum value.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 1/e.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 1/e} \\]"
