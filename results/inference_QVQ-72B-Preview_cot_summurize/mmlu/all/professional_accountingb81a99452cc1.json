                    "text": "So I have this problem here about expected returns of securities. It says that Securities A, B, and C have expected returns of 7%, 12%, and 5%, respectively. Then it asks for the expected return of an equally weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C. The options are 10%, 8.50%, 6%, and 12%.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what an equally weighted portfolio means. I think it means that each security in the portfolio has the same weight or proportion. So, if I have two securities, A and C, and they're equally weighted, that means each one makes up 50% of the portfolio.\n\nNow, the expected return of a portfolio is usually the weighted average of the expected returns of the individual securities. So, if both A and C are equally weighted, each with 50%, then the portfolio's expected return should be the average of their expected returns.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nPortfolio expected return = (weight of A * expected return of A) + (weight of C * expected return of C)\n\nGiven that they're equally weighted, weight of A = weight of C = 0.5\n\nSo, portfolio expected return = (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%)\n\nWait, let's make sure. Percentages are in decimal form, right? So, 7% is 0.07 and 5% is 0.05.\n\nSo, portfolio expected return = (0.5 * 0.07) + (0.5 * 0.05)\n\nLet me calculate that: 0.5 times 0.07 is 0.035, and 0.5 times 0.05 is 0.025. Adding them up, 0.035 + 0.025 = 0.06\n\nSo, that's 0.06, which is 6%.\n\nLooking back at the options, C is 6%, so that seems to be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there's any trick here.\n\nThe problem mentions Securities A, B, and C, but only A and C are in the portfolio. Security B isn't part of this portfolio, so I don't need to consider it.\n\nAlso, it's an equal-weighted portfolio of A and C, so yes, 50% each is correct.\n\nIs there any other factor that could affect the expected return? Like correlation between A and C, or something like that? Hmm.\n\nWait, in the context of portfolio theory, the expected return of a portfolio is indeed the weighted average of the expected returns of the individual assets, assuming no additional information about covariance or anything else. So, in this case, since it's just about expected returns and weights, I think averaging A and C's returns is the right approach.\n\nLet me see if maybe there's a different way to look at it. Suppose I invest $1 in this portfolio. Half in A and half in C. The return from A would be 0.5 times 7%, which is 0.035, and from C, 0.5 times 5%, which is 0.025. Total return is 0.06, which again is 6%.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of the formula for expected portfolio return, which is E(Rp) = sum (wi * E(Ri)), where wi is the weight of asset i and E(Ri) is the expected return of asset i.\n\nGiven that, E(Rp) = 0.5*0.07 + 0.5*0.05 = 0.06, as I calculated before.\n\nI don't see any complication here that would change this calculation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 6%, which is option C.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider why the other options might be wrong.\n\nOption A is 10%. That would be the case if the portfolio was equally weighted between A and B, since 7% and 12% averaged is 9.5%, but that's not the case here. So, 10% doesn't make sense.\n\nOption B is 8.50%. That seems higher than what we calculated. Unless there's some other weighting or consideration, but based on the information given, 8.5% isn't correct.\n\nOption D is 12%, which is the expected return of Security B alone. But since B isn't part of the portfolio being considered, this doesn't apply.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C, 6%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
