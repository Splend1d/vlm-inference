So, the remaining soccer balls are blue, pink, or green, and there are equal numbers of each of these colors. I need to find out how many green soccer balls there are.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many soccer balls are not white. Since there are 30 in total and 9 are white, I can subtract 9 from 30 to find the number of non-white soccer balls.\n\n30 - 9 = 21\n\nSo, there are 21 soccer balls that are either blue, pink, or green.\n\nNow, it says that there is an equal number of blue, pink, and green balls. That means each of these colors has the same number of soccer balls. Since there are three colors, I can divide the total number of non-white soccer balls by 3 to find out how many there are of each color.\n\n21 \u00f7 3 = 7\n\nTherefore, there are 7 soccer balls of each color: blue, pink, and green.\n\nThe question specifically asks for the number of green soccer balls, so the answer should be 7.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. We have 30 total soccer balls, 9 white, and the remaining 21 divided equally among blue, pink, and green. So, 21 divided by 3 gives 7 each. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 7\n\nB. 10\n\nC. 21\n\nD. 39\n\nSo, option A. 7 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 7} \\]"
