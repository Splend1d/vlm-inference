                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about the communications plan stages according to Cutlip (2006). The question is asking which stage should involve planning of what should be said and why. The options are A. Situation analysis, B. Strategy, C. Implementation, or D. Evaluation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each stage entails based on Cutlip's model. I remember that the communications plan typically consists of several phases: situation analysis, strategy, implementation, and evaluation. Each phase plays a crucial role in the overall communication effort.\n\nLet me think about the situation analysis first. This phase is all about understanding the current environment, identifying opportunities and challenges, and gathering information about the target audience, stakeholders, and the market. It's kind of like doing your homework before you start planning anything. So, does this involve planning what should be said and why? Hmm, not directly. I think it's more about research and analysis rather than deciding the message content.\n\nNext is strategy. This seems more relevant. After understanding the situation through the situation analysis, the strategy phase is where you decide on the objectives, target audiences, key messages, and the overall approach to achieve your communication goals. So, planning what should be said and why sounds a lot like developing key messages and understanding the rationale behind them, which fits into this stage.\n\nImplementation is the phase where you actually carry out the plan. This involves executing the tactics and activities outlined in the strategy phase, such as creating and distributing content, organizing events, or engaging with the media. While implementation involves delivering the messages, the planning of what to say and why should have already been decided in the strategy phase.\n\nLastly, evaluation is about assessing the effectiveness of the communication efforts. This includes measuring whether the objectives were met, analyzing the impact on the target audience, and learning from the experience to improve future campaigns. Evaluation is more about looking back and understanding what worked and what didn't, rather than planning what to say and why.\n\nGiven this, it seems that the strategy phase is where the planning of what should be said and why takes place. Let me double-check this understanding.\n\nFor example, in the strategy phase, communicators would define the core message or key points they want to convey to their audience. They would also consider the reasons behind these messages, such as the benefits to the audience, the organization's positioning, or the desired outcome of the communication.\n\nIn contrast, the situation analysis is more about research and understanding the context, implementation is about executing the plan, and evaluation is about assessing the results.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the correct answer should be B. Strategy.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"which stage of the communications plan should involve planning of what should be said and why?\" and the options are labeled A through D. According to my understanding, B. Strategy is the right choice.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any possibility that another stage could also involve planning what to say and why.\n\nFor instance, in the implementation phase, there might be some level of message refinement or adaptation based on the specific channels or tactics being used. However, the fundamental decisions about what to say and why should already have been made in the strategy phase.\n\nIn evaluation, while you might reflect on the messages and their effectiveness, this is more about reviewing past decisions rather than planning new ones.\n\nThe situation analysis, as I mentioned earlier, is primarily about gathering and analyzing information, not about planning the message content.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. Strategy.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll look back at Cutlip's model. Stephen H. Cutlip, as I recall, wrote about public relations and communication theories. In his book \"Effective Public Relations,\" co-authored with Allen H. Center and Glen M. Broom, the planning process is outlined in a similar fashion to what I've described.\n\nSo, adhering to Cutlip's framework, the planning of what to say and why indeed falls under the strategy phase of the communications plan.\n\nAlright, I think that's it. The answer is B. Strategy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
