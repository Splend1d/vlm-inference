                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to find the present value of $10 that I'll receive in two years, given that the discount rate is 9%. The options are A. $9, B. $11, C. $8.26, and D. $8.42.\n\nFirst off, I remember that present value is basically the current worth of a future sum of money, considering the time value of money. So, money received in the future is worth less than the same amount today because of inflation and the potential earning capacity of money if it's invested.\n\nThe formula to calculate the present value (PV) of a future cash flow is:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(FV\\) is the future value, which is $10 in this case.\n\n- \\(r\\) is the discount rate, which is 9% or 0.09 in decimal form.\n\n- \\(n\\) is the number of periods, which is 2 years.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{10}{(1 + 0.09)^2} \\]\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate \\(1 + 0.09\\):\n\n\\[ 1 + 0.09 = 1.09 \\]\n\nThen, raise 1.09 to the power of 2:\n\n\\[ 1.09^2 = 1.1881 \\]\n\nNow, divide $10 by 1.1881:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{10}{1.1881} \\]\n\nLet me do this division.\n\nFirst, 10 divided by 1.1881.\n\nWell, 1.1881 times 8 is 9.5048, and 10 minus 9.5048 is about 0.4952.\n\nThen, take the decimal part: 0.4952 divided by 1.1881.\n\n1.1881 times 0.4 is 0.47524, and 0.4952 minus 0.47524 is about 0.01996.\n\nNext, 0.01996 divided by 1.1881.\n\n1.1881 times 0.016 is about 0.0190096, and 0.01996 minus 0.0190096 is about 0.0009504.\n\nContinuing this process, it's getting a bit tedious, and I can see that the PV is approximately 8.42.\n\nLet me confirm this with a calculator to ensure accuracy.\n\nCalculating \\(1.09^2\\) gives 1.1881, as I had before.\n\nThen, \\(10 / 1.1881\\) equals approximately 8.42.\n\nSo, the present value is roughly $8.42.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $9\n\nB. $11\n\nC. $8.26\n\nD. $8.42\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. $8.42.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me verify the formula again. Yes, the present value formula is indeed \\( PV = \\frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n} \\).\n\nAnd I have the future value as $10, the discount rate as 9% (which is 0.09), and the time as 2 years.\n\nPlugging in the numbers again:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{10}{(1 + 0.09)^2} = \\frac{10}{1.1881} \\approx 8.42 \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the present value in terms of the discount factor.\n\nThe discount factor is \\( \\frac{1}{(1 + r)^n} \\), which in this case is \\( \\frac{1}{1.1881} \\approx 0.842 \\).\n\nMultiplying the future value by the discount factor: \\(10 \\times 0.842 = 8.42\\).\n\nAgain, this confirms the present value is $8.42.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is D. $8.42.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I'll consider another approach.\n\nSuppose I use the present value interest factor (PVIF), which is the same as the discount factor: \\( \\frac{1}{(1 + r)^n} \\).\n\nFor r = 9% and n = 2, PVIF = \\( \\frac{1}{1.1881} \\approx 0.842 \\).\n\nMultiplying by the future value: \\(10 \\times 0.842 = 8.42\\).\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the present value formula in terms of multiple periods, it's still the same calculation.\n\nI don't think there's another straightforward way to approach this, so I'll stick with this answer.\n\nOne thing to note is that the options are quite close to each other, so it's essential to be precise with the calculations.\n\nGiven that, and having verified the calculation multiple times using different methods, I conclude that the present value is indeed approximately $8.42.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. $8.42.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
