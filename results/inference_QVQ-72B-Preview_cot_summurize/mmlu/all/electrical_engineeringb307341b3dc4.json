None.\"\n\nAlright, I need to recall what SRAM and DRAM are and how they store data.\n\nFirst off, SRAM stands for Static Random Access Memory, and DRAM stands for Dynamic Random Access Memory. Both are types of semiconductor memory used in computers, but they work differently.\n\nLet me think about SRAM first. SRAM uses a flip-flop to store each bit, and typically, that involves multiple transistors. I think it's usually six transistors per bit in a standard SRAM cell. So, that would be a transistor and some other components, but not just one transistor and one capacitor. So, maybe SRAM isn't the answer.\n\nNow, DRAM. I remember that DRAM stores each bit in a capacitor within a memory cell. Because it's dynamic, the charge in the capacitor can leak over time, so it needs to be refreshed periodically. So, for each bit, there's a capacitor to hold the charge (representing the data) and usually one transistor to control access to that capacitor.\n\nWait, that sounds like one transistor and one capacitor per memory cell in DRAM. So, that seems to match the description in the question.\n\nLet me double-check. SRAM uses a flip-flop per bit, which is multiple transistors, no capacitor involved. DRAM uses a capacitor and a transistor per bit. So, according to this, DRAM uses one transistor and one capacitor as the basic memory unit.\n\nIs there any chance that SRAM also uses one transistor and one capacitor? No, SRAM relies on transistors arranged in a flip-flop configuration, which typically involves more than one transistor and no capacitor.\n\nLet me consider if there are any exceptions or different types of SRAM that might use a different design. I think in some advanced SRAM designs, there might be variations, but generally, the standard cell is six transistors without any capacitor.\n\nOn the other hand, DRAM cells are known for their simple design of one transistor and one capacitor. This design allows for higher density memory chips compared to SRAM, which is why DRAM is commonly used for main memory in computers where storage capacity is important.\n\nSo, based on this, the correct answer should be B. DRAM.\n\nWait a minute, the option C says both SRAM and DRAM. But from what I recall, only DRAM uses one transistor and one capacitor per bit. SRAM does not use a capacitor in its cell design.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll think about the structures again:\n\n- SRAM cell: typically six transistors in a cross-coupled pair forming a flip-flop. No capacitor.\n\n- DRAM cell: one transistor and one capacitor.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Therefore, only DRAM uses one transistor and one capacitor as the basic memory unit.\n\nI don't think the answer is D. None, because DRAM does fit the description.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. DRAM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
