                    "text": "Okay, so I'm trying to understand this question about Hare's view on the term \"ought.\" It says that once two people agree on the meaning of \"ought,\" then which of the following is true:\n\nA. They will share all the same moral opinions.\n\nB. They will disagree morally only if they disagree about the facts of the case.\n\nC. They will disagree morally only if they have different inclinations.\n\nD. None of the above.\n\nI need to figure out what Hare would say about this. I remember that R.M. Hare was a philosopher who worked on moral language, especially on the idea that moral statements are prescriptions or imperatives, not descriptions of the world.\n\nSo, if two people agree on what \"ought\" means, what does that imply for their moral opinions?\n\nLet me think about option A: They will share all the same moral opinions.\n\nDoes agreeing on the meaning of \"ought\" mean that they will always have the same moral views? That seems too strong. Even if we agree on what \"ought\" means, we might still disagree on specific moral issues based on different facts or different weightings of moral considerations. So, I doubt that agreeing on \"ought\" would mean we share all the same moral opinions. Maybe this is not the right choice.\n\nOption B: They will disagree morally only if they disagree about the facts of the case.\n\nThis suggests that if two people agree on the meaning of \"ought,\" then any moral disagreement must be due to a disagreement about the facts relevant to the case. This seems plausible because if we agree on what \"ought\" means, then differences in our moral conclusions might stem from different beliefs about the state of the world or the consequences of actions.\n\nWait, but is that always the case? Couldn't two people agree on the facts but still disagree on what ought to be done because they assign different importance to certain values or principles? For example, both might agree that lying is wrong, but one might think that lying is always wrong, while the other thinks that lying is permissible to save someone's life. So, even if they agree on the facts, they might disagree on the moral weight of those facts.\n\nHmm, maybe this is a bit too simplistic. Perhaps agreeing on \"ought\" means that they agree on the prescriptive force of moral statements, but they might still differ in their moral principles or the way they prioritize different moral considerations.\n\nOption C: They will disagree morally only if they have different inclinations.\n\nThis suggests that moral disagreements would only occur due to differences in personal preferences or inclinations. But this seems problematic. Moral disagreements aren't just about personal tastes; they can be about principled differences in how we think people should act or what is right and wrong.\n\nFor example, two people might both agree that stealing is wrong, but one might steal out of desperation while the other would never steal, even in dire circumstances. Their moral judgments are the same, but their actions differ based on inclination. This doesn't seem to align with the idea that agreeing on \"ought\" would resolve all moral disagreements except those based on inclination.\n\nAlternatively, two people might have the same inclinations but different moral judgments. For instance, both might be inclined to help others, but one might believe that mandatory charity is morally required, while the other thinks it's supererogatory\u2014good but not obligatory.\n\nSo, it seems that inclination isn't the primary factor in moral disagreement, at least not in the way this option suggests.\n\nGiven that, maybe option D: None of the above is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe I'm missing something about Hare's position. I recall that Hare proposed that moral statements are prescriptions and that moral discourse is persuasive in nature. He also talked about \"broad\" and \"narrow\" ethical terms, where \"broad\" terms like \"good\" or \"ought\" are more general, and \"narrow\" terms are more specific to particular ethical systems.\n\nIf two people agree on the meaning of \"ought,\" perhaps they agree on the logical structure of moral statements or the way moral imperatives function. But does that necessarily align their specific moral conclusions?\n\nI think not. They could still disagree on particular moral issues based on different factual beliefs or different moral principles.\n\nConsider this: if \"ought\" is used to express a prescription, like \"one ought to do X,\" and both agree on what \"ought\" means, they might still disagree on what X is in a given situation.\n\nFor example, both might agree that \"ought\" means \"it is prescribed that,\" but they might disagree on whether it is prescribed to tell the truth in a particular scenario.\n\nTherefore, agreeing on \"ought\" doesn't ensure agreement on all moral opinions, nor does it limit disagreement solely to factual disputes or inclinations.\n\nPerhaps the key is that agreeing on \"ought\" means they share the same understanding of the prescriptive nature of moral statements, but they can still have different moral prescriptions based on different principles or facts.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I think the answer is D: none of the above.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
