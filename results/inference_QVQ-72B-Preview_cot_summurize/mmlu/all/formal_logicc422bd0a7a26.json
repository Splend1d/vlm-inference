So, the symbols are:\n\n- a: Alexis\n\n- b: Ben\n\n- Gxy: x greets y\n\nOkay, so the statement is about Alexis being greeted by Ben. That means Ben is doing the greeting, and Alexis is receiving the greeting. So, in terms of the predicate, the subject doing the greeting is Ben, and the object being greeted is Alexis.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Gab\n\nWait, that would be G(a, b), which according to the symbols would mean Alexis greets Ben. But that's the opposite of what the statement says. So, that can't be right.\n\nB. ~Gba\n\nThis has a tilde, which means not, so it's negating G(b, a). G(b, a) would be Ben greets Alexis, so negating that would mean Ben does not greet Alexis. But the statement says Alexis is greeted by Ben, which implies that Ben does greet Alexis. So, this doesn't match.\n\nC. aGb\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Is this the same as G(a, b)? If so, that would again be Alexis greets Ben, which is the opposite of what's stated. So, probably not correct.\n\nD. Gba\n\nThis would be G(b, a), which is Ben greets Alexis. That matches exactly with the statement that Alexis is greeted by Ben.\n\nWait a minute, but option C is aGb, which might be another way of writing G(a, b), which again seems like Alexis greets Ben. So, that doesn't match.\n\nSo, between options A, C, and D, only option D matches the statement.\n\nBut let me double-check. In predicate logic, the order of variables is crucial. Gxy means x greets y, so G(b, a) would be Ben greets Alexis, which matches \"Alexis is greeted by Ben.\"\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct translation should be G(b, a), which is option D: Gba.\n\nOption A: Gab is G(a, b), which is Alexis greets Ben.\n\nOption B: ~Gba is not Ben greets Alexis.\n\nOption C: aGb is probably a typo or miswritten, as it should be G(a, b), which again is Alexis greets Ben.\n\nTherefore, the best translation is option D: Gba.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
