                    "text": "So I have this question about radio telescopes, and I need to find out which one has the largest parabolic antenna from the given options: Green Bank Telescope, Arecibo Telescope, Yevpatoria RT-70 Telescope, and Effelsberg Telescope. I'm not super familiar with all of these, but I've heard of some of them. Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what a parabolic antenna is. I know that radio telescopes use antennas to collect and focus radio waves from space. A parabolic antenna is a type of reflector antenna that has a parabolic shape, which helps to direct the radio waves to a single point, the focus, where the receiver is placed. So, the larger the parabolic antenna, the more radio waves it can collect and the better its resolution.\n\nAlright, so I need to compare the sizes of these antennas. I think I can look up the diameters of each telescope's antenna to determine which one is the largest.\n\nLet's start with the Green Bank Telescope. I've heard of this one; it's in West Virginia, I think. I recall that it's pretty big. Let me see if I can find its antenna diameter. Oh, here it is: the Green Bank Telescope has a 100-meter diameter antenna. That sounds impressive.\n\nNext, the Arecibo Telescope. I've definitely heard of this one too. It's in Puerto Rico, and I think it's even bigger than the Green Bank Telescope. Wait, but I heard that Arecibo had some issues recently; there was a collapse or something. But regardless, I think its antenna is larger than Green Bank's. Let me confirm that. Yes, the Arecibo Telescope had a 305-meter antenna, which is significantly larger than Green Bank's 100 meters.\n\nHmm, so Arecibo seems bigger, but since it collapsed, does that mean it's no longer operational? I think it's important to consider whether the telescope is still in use or not. But the question is just asking about which one has the largest parabolic antenna, not necessarily which one is currently operational.\n\nMoving on to the Yevpatoria RT-70 Telescope. I'm not as familiar with this one. Let me look it up. Oh, it's in Ukraine, and it has a 70-meter antenna. That's smaller than both Green Bank and Arecibo.\n\nLastly, the Effelsberg Telescope. I think this is in Germany. Yes, it's located near Bonn. I believe it has a 100-meter antenna, similar to the Green Bank Telescope.\n\nSo, from what I've gathered:\n\n- Green Bank Telescope: 100 meters\n\n- Arecibo Telescope: 305 meters\n\n- Yevpatoria RT-70 Telescope: 70 meters\n\n- Effelsberg Telescope: 100 meters\n\nClearly, the Arecibo Telescope has the largest parabolic antenna at 305 meters, compared to the others which are 100 meters or less.\n\nBut wait a minute, I recall that Arecibo had some structural failures and partially collapsed. Does that mean its antenna is no longer intact or fully operational? Upon checking, the Arecibo Observatory experienced cable failures in 2020, which led to the collapse of the instrument platform, rendering the telescope inoperable. So, as of now, it's not functional.\n\nHowever, the question is asking about which telescope has the largest parabolic antenna, not necessarily which one is currently operational. So, even if Arecibo is no longer in use, its antenna still exists, at least partially, and was the largest before its collapse.\n\nBut maybe there's another telescope with a larger antenna that I'm not aware of. Wait, the question specifies from these four options, so I don't need to consider others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing knowledge about historical versus current capabilities. If that's the case, then selecting Arecibo would be correct based on its historical significance and size, despite its current status.\n\nAlternatively, if considering only operational telescopes, then Green Bank and Effelsberg both have 100-meter antennas, and Yevpatoria has a 70-meter antenna. But since Arecibo was larger, and the question doesn't specify operational status, I think Arecibo is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is trying to trick me by including Arecibo, knowing that it's no longer operational. But again, the question is specifically about which has the largest parabolic antenna, not about current operational status.\n\nTo be thorough, I should confirm the sizes again. Green Bank: 100 meters. Arecibo: 305 meters. Yevpatoria: 70 meters. Effelsberg: 100 meters. So, regardless of operational status, Arecibo has the largest antenna.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Arecibo Telescope.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
