                    "text": "Alright, I've got two statements here about machine learning concepts, and I need to decide whether they're true or false. Let's tackle them one by one.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: \"L2 regularization of linear models tends to make models more sparse than L1 regularization.\"\n\nHmm, I remember learning about L1 and L2 regularization in the context of linear models like linear regression and logistic regression. Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. The idea is to keep the coefficients of the model small, which can help simplify the model and improve its generalization to new data.\n\nNow, specifically, L1 regularization is also known as Lasso regularization, and L2 is Ridge regularization. I recall that L1 regularization can set some coefficients exactly to zero, especially for features that are not very important. This property makes L1 regularization useful for feature selection because it effectively eliminates some features from the model by setting their weights to zero, leading to a sparse model.\n\nOn the other hand, L2 regularization tends to spread out the coefficient values more evenly and doesn't usually set any coefficients exactly to zero. It shrinks all coefficients towards zero but doesn't eliminate any features entirely. So, in terms of sparsity, L1 is more likely to produce models with fewer non-zero coefficients compared to L2.\n\nWait a minute, but the statement says that L2 regularization tends to make models more sparse than L1 regularization. Based on what I remember, that seems counterintuitive. If L1 regularization is known for producing sparse models by setting some coefficients to zero, then shouldn't L1 make models more sparse than L2?\n\nLet me double-check this. Maybe there's something I'm missing here.\n\nI think I might be confusing the general behavior with specific scenarios. Perhaps in some cases, L2 regularization could lead to sparser models, but from what I know, it's less common. Let me consider the definitions again.\n\nL1 regularization adds the absolute value of the coefficients to the loss function, which can push some coefficients to exactly zero, especially when the feature isn't contributing much to the prediction. L2 regularization adds the squared value of the coefficients, which penalizes large coefficients but doesn't set any to zero unless the regularization parameter is infinitely large, which isn't practical.\n\nSo, in practice, L1 regularization is more likely to produce sparse models with many zero coefficients, whereas L2 regularization will have all coefficients non-zero but smaller in magnitude.\n\nTherefore, the statement seems to be incorrect. L1 regularization, not L2, tends to make models more sparse.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2: \"Residual connections can be found in ResNets and Transformers.\"\n\nResidual connections are a key component in Residual Neural Networks, or ResNets, which were introduced by He et al. in 2015. The idea behind residual connections is to address the vanishing gradient problem in deep neural networks by allowing gradients to flow through the network more easily via shortcut connections. In ResNets, these connections skip one or more layers, and the output of a residual block is the sum of the input and the output of the skipped layers.\n\nNow, regarding Transformers, which were introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017 for natural language processing tasks, they also utilize residual connections. In Transformers, residual connections are used around each sub-layer, such as the multi-head self-attention layers and the position-wise feed-forward networks. These connections help stabilize the training of deep Transformer models by preserving gradient information across layers.\n\nSo, both ResNets and Transformers employ residual connections as a fundamental part of their architecture to improve the flow of gradients and enhance model performance.\n\nTherefore, the statement that residual connections can be found in ResNets and Transformers is true.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Statement 1: False (L1 regularization tends to make models more sparse than L2 regularization, not the other way around.)\n\n- Statement 2: True (Residual connections are used in both ResNets and Transformers.)\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. False, True.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nYes, D is the correct choice.\n\nI think that's it. I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
