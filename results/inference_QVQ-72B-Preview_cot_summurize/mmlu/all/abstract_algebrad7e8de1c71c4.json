                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one at a time. Starting with Statement 1: For finite groups G and H, |G + H| = |G||H|, where G + H is the internal direct product.\n\nFirst off, I need to make sure I understand what an internal direct product is. From what I recall, if G and H are normal subgroups of a group K, and their intersection is trivial (meaning only the identity element), and together they generate the whole group K, then K is the internal direct product of G and H. So, K = G + H in this context.\n\nBut wait, the notation here is a bit confusing. Usually, the internal direct product is denoted by G \u00d7 H, not G + H. Maybe the plus sign is being used to represent the direct product in this context. I'll assume that's the case.\n\nSo, if G and H are finite groups, and their internal direct product is G \u00d7 H, then yes, the order of the direct product is the product of the orders of G and H, provided that their intersection is trivial in the larger group. But since they are just given as finite groups without specifying they are subgroups of a larger group, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nActually, when we talk about the direct product of two groups G and H, denoted G \u00d7 H, it's a new group consisting of ordered pairs (g, h) where g is in G and h is in H, with component-wise operation. In this case, the order of G \u00d7 H is indeed |G| \u00d7 |H|, regardless of whether they are subgroups of some larger group or not.\n\nSo, Statement 1 seems to be saying that |G + H| = |G||H|, assuming G + H is the internal direct product, which I'm interpreting as the direct product G \u00d7 H. If that's the case, then yes, it's true that |G \u00d7 H| = |G||H| for finite groups G and H.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any scenario where |G + H| wouldn't equal |G||H|? Well, if G and H are not independent in some way, or if their intersection isn't trivial in the context of the internal direct product, then the order might not simply multiply. But in the case of the external direct product G \u00d7 H, there are no such issues, and the orders do multiply.\n\nSo, I think Statement 1 is true.\n\nNow, moving on to Statement 2: If r divides m and s divides n, then Z_m + Z_n has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s.\n\nFirst, I need to clarify what Z_m + Z_n means in this context. Again, assuming it's the direct product Z_m \u00d7 Z_n, which is a common notation.\n\nSo, Z_m \u00d7 Z_n is the direct product of the cyclic groups of order m and n, respectively. Similarly, Z_r + Z_s would be Z_r \u00d7 Z_s, the direct product of cyclic groups of order r and s.\n\nThe statement is claiming that if r divides m and s divides n, then Z_m \u00d7 Z_n has a subgroup that is isomorphic to Z_r \u00d7 Z_s.\n\nI need to verify if this is always true.\n\nLet's recall that Z_m is a cyclic group of order m, and similarly for Z_n, Z_r, and Z_s.\n\nSince r divides m, there exists a subgroup of Z_m of order r, namely Z_m / (m/r) Z_m, or more simply, the subgroup generated by m/r.\n\nSimilarly, since s divides n, there exists a subgroup of Z_n of order s.\n\nTherefore, Z_m has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r, and Z_n has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_s.\n\nNow, since Z_m and Z_n are being direct multiplied to form Z_m \u00d7 Z_n, and their direct product has subgroups corresponding to their individual subgroups, it should be possible to take the direct product of these subgroups.\n\nThat is, take the subgroup isomorphic to Z_r from Z_m and the subgroup isomorphic to Z_s from Z_n, and form their direct product within Z_m \u00d7 Z_n.\n\nThis resulting subgroup should be isomorphic to Z_r \u00d7 Z_s.\n\nTherefore, under the conditions that r divides m and s divides n, Z_m \u00d7 Z_n does indeed have a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r \u00d7 Z_s.\n\nSo, Statement 2 also appears to be true.\n\nWait a minute, but the answer options are:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nGiven that both statements seem to be true based on my reasoning, the answer should be A. True, True.\n\nBut perhaps there's a catch somewhere. Let me double-check both statements once more.\n\nFor Statement 1, |G + H| = |G||H|, assuming + represents the direct product. Yes, that's standard for direct products of groups, especially for finite groups.\n\nFor Statement 2, given r divides m and s divides n, Z_m \u00d7 Z_n has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r \u00d7 Z_s. That also seems correct based on the divisibility conditions and the existence of corresponding subgroups.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that both statements are true.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
