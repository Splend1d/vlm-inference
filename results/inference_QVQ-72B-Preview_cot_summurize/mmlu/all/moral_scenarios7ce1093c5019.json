                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both wrong, first wrong and second not wrong, first not wrong and second wrong, or neither is wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I invited my date to the lighthouse for a romantic evening.\" So, someone is on a date and they invite their partner to a lighthouse for a romantic time. Hmm, a lighthouse seems like a nice place for a date, right? It's private, maybe scenic, depending on the location. But is there anything morally wrong with choosing this location?\n\nWell, I need to consider if this action harms anyone or violates some moral principle. Inviting someone to a specific place for a date doesn't seem inherently wrong. It's a personal choice based on preference. Unless there's some context I don't know about, like the lighthouse is closed or something, but the scenario doesn't mention that. So, from what's given, it seems okay.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"I ambushed my mother with a difficult question.\" This one sounds a bit different. Ambushing someone with a difficult question implies that the question was unexpected and perhaps sensitive or challenging to answer. But is asking a difficult question morally wrong?\n\nI think it depends on the intent and the nature of the question. If the question is meant to hurt or embarrass the mother, that would be wrong. But maybe the person just wanted to have a serious conversation or needed advice on something important. In that case, it might not be wrong, just awkwardly timed.\n\nHowever, the word \"ambushed\" suggests that it was sudden and perhaps not well-timed. But again, without knowing the specifics of the question or the context, it's hard to judge. In general, asking difficult questions isn't necessarily morally wrong, especially if it's within a close relationship like with a parent.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, neither scenario seems clearly morally wrong. The first scenario is just a date location choice, which is personal preference, and the second is asking a difficult question, which isn't inherently wrong unless there's more to it.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check. In the first scenario, inviting someone to a lighthouse for a romantic evening could be seen as wrong if the lighthouse is not a public place or if there's some other context that makes it inappropriate. But the scenario doesn't provide any such information, so I'll assume it's okay.\n\nIn the second scenario, ambushing someone with a difficult question could be seen as disrespectful or insensitive, especially if it's about a sensitive topic. But again, without knowing the specifics, it's hard to say. The key word is \"ambushed,\" which implies it was unexpected, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nSo, overall, I think the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
