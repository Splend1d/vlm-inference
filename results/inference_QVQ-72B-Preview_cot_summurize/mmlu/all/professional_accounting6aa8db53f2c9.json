                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this direct labor rate variance problem. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it.\n\nFirst off, I know that the direct labor rate variance measures the difference between the actual cost of labor and the standard cost of labor based on the actual hours worked and the standard wage rate. The formula for the direct labor rate variance is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Direct Labor Rate Variance} = (\\text{Actual Hours} \\times (\\text{Actual Rate} - \\text{Standard Rate}))\n\\]\n\nBut I need to be careful here. The problem gives me a lot of information, and I need to make sure I'm using the right numbers.\n\nLet me list out what I know:\n\n- Predicted to manufacture: 10,000 units\n\n- Standard direct labor hours per unit: 2.4 hours\n\n- Standard wage rate: $20 per hour\n\n- Total standard labor cost per unit: $48.00 (which is 2.4 hours \u00d7 $20/hour)\n\n- Actual production: 9,000 units\n\n- Actual direct labor hours per unit: 2.5 hours\n\n- Actual wage rate: $21 per hour\n\n- Total actual labor cost per unit: $52.50 (which is 2.5 hours \u00d7 $21/hour)\n\nOkay, so the standard is based on 2.4 hours per unit at $20 per hour, totaling $48 per unit.\n\nThe actual is 2.5 hours per unit at $21 per hour, totaling $52.50 per unit.\n\nBut for the rate variance, I need to look at the difference in rates multiplied by the actual hours worked.\n\nWait a minute, but I have per unit figures here. Maybe I should think in terms of total hours worked.\n\nFirst, let's find out the total actual hours worked.\n\nSince they made 9,000 units and used 2.5 hours per unit, total actual hours are:\n\n\\[\n9,000 \\times 2.5 = 22,500 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, the actual rate is $21 per hour, and the standard rate is $20 per hour.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Direct Labor Rate Variance} = 22,500 \\times (21 - 20) = 22,500 \\times 1 = \\$22,500\n\\]\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nI recall that the direct labor rate variance is also called the price variance or the spending variance. It isolates the impact of paying a different wage rate from the standard.\n\nSo, if the company paid $21 per hour instead of $20 per hour for the same hours worked, the variance would be the difference in wages multiplied by the hours worked.\n\nGiven that, my calculation seems correct.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, the total actual labor cost is:\n\n\\[\n22,500 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$21/\\text{hour} = \\$472,500\n\\]\n\nThe standard cost for the actual hours would be:\n\n\\[\n22,500 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$20/\\text{hour} = \\$450,000\n\\]\n\nSo, the rate variance is:\n\n\\[\n\\$472,500 - \\$450,000 = \\$22,500\n\\]\n\nWhich confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect this.\n\nIs there any mention of efficiency? Well, efficiency would affect the direct labor efficiency variance, but we're specifically asked for the rate variance.\n\nThe rate variance is purely about the difference in wage rates paid, not about the hours worked.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to conclude that the direct labor rate variance is $22,500.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $18,000\n\nB. $22,500\n\nC. $25,000\n\nD. $40,500\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. $22,500.\n\nBut wait a second, maybe I should consider whether this is an unfavorable or favorable variance.\n\nGiven that the actual rate is higher than the standard rate ($21 vs. $20), the variance is unfavorable. That means the company spent more on labor than it should have based on the standard rate.\n\nBut the question only asks for the amount, not the favorability.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The answer is $22,500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22500} \\]"
