Ten. Hmm, I think I remember something about Columbus's voyage, but I might be a bit rusty on the details. Let me see if I can recall.\n\nI know that Christopher Columbus was an explorer who sailed from Spain in search of a western route to Asia but ended up discovering what came to be known as the New World. That was in 1492, right? So, he set off from Spain in that year, but I can't quite remember how many ships he had with him.\n\nLet me consider what I know about his voyage. I think he had three ships: the Santa Maria, the Pinta, and the Ni\u00f1a. Yeah, that sounds familiar. So, that would mean he had three ships in total. But let me double-check because I don't want to get it wrong.\n\nI recall that the Santa Maria was the flagship, and it was larger than the other two. The Pinta and the Ni\u00f1a were smaller caravels. So, that makes sense\u2014three ships in all. But just to be thorough, maybe I should think about whether there were any additional vessels that might have been part of the fleet.\n\nWait a minute, I think there might have been some variations in different accounts, but from what I remember, the original plan involved more ships. Maybe there were plans for five or even ten ships, but due to various reasons, they ended up sailing with only three. Is that possible?\n\nLet me think about that. Perhaps there were initial proposals for a larger fleet, but due to funding constraints or availability of ships, they had to scale back. That would make sense, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I'm confusing it with another expedition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Columbus had support ships or something, but I don't think so. His was a relatively small expedition compared to later voyages. So, I think the answer is three ships: the Santa Maria, the Pinta, and the Ni\u00f1a.\n\nJust to be extra sure, maybe I should consider looking up a quick reference or recalling if there were any other ships that accompanied him on that first voyage. Let me see, the first voyage was in 1492, and it was composed of these three ships with around 90 men in total, I think.\n\nYeah, that seems consistent. So, based on that, the correct answer should be B. Three.\n\nWait, but let's consider if there could be any confusion here. For example, maybe in subsequent voyages, Columbus had different numbers of ships. I believe in his second voyage, he had a much larger fleet, something like 17 ships or so. But that was after the first voyage, so it shouldn't affect this question.\n\nSo, to sum it up, on his initial voyage in 1492, Columbus set sail with three ships: the Santa Maria, the Pinta, and the Ni\u00f1a. Therefore, the answer is B. Three.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
