                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about the demand curve for a perfectly competitive firm's product. There are four options, and I need to pick the correct one. Let's see.\n\nOption A says the demand curve is downward sloping and equal to the market demand curve. Hmm, in perfect competition, the firm is a price taker, meaning it has to accept the market price as given. So, the demand curve for the individual firm should be horizontal at the market price, not downward sloping. The market demand curve is downward sloping, but for the individual firm, it's different. So, probably not A.\n\nOption B says the demand curve is perfectly elastic. That sounds familiar. Perfectly elastic means the quantity demanded doesn't change in response to a change in price. In perfect competition, since the firm is a price taker, it can sell as much as it wants at the going market price. So, from the firm's perspective, the demand curve is horizontal, which is perfectly elastic. That seems right.\n\nOption C is perfectly inelastic. That would mean the quantity demanded doesn't change at all, even if the price changes. That doesn't sound right for a perfectly competitive firm. If the price changes, the firm will sell more or less depending on the price, right? So, probably not C.\n\nOption D says the demand curve is kinked at the going market price. Kinked demand curves are more associated with oligopoly models, like the Sweezy model, where firms face a demand curve that bends or has a kink at the current price. In perfect competition, though, the demand curve is supposed to be perfectly elastic, not kinked. So, I don't think D is correct.\n\nLet me double-check. In perfect competition, the firm faces a horizontal demand curve because it's a price taker. The market determines the price, and the firm can sell all it wants at that price. So, the demand curve for the firm is perfectly elastic, which matches option B.\n\nI think the answer is B. Perfectly elastic.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
