                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what Hume thought about justice. The question is asking whether justice has value, and if so, where that value comes from. The options are:\n\nA. Justice has no value.\n\nB. Justice has value in part because it is useful to society.\n\nC. Justice has value solely because it is useful to society.\n\nD. Justice has value solely because it is useful to the agent.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what Hume said about justice. I remember that Hume was an empiricist philosopher who wrote about many topics, including ethics and political philosophy. He lived in the 18th century, during the Scottish Enlightenment.\n\nI think Hume discussed justice in his major works, especially in \"A Treatise of Human Nature\" and \"An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals.\" I should look back at those texts to find his views on justice.\n\nLet me consider option A: justice has no value. That seems extreme. Hume was interested in moral philosophy and believed that morals are based on feelings and sentiments rather than reason alone. But I don't recall him saying that justice has no value. In fact, he probably thought justice was important for social order.\n\nOption B says that justice has value in part because it is useful to society. This suggests that utility or practical benefits to society play a role in justifying justice. Hume was influenced by the idea of utility, and he did emphasize the importance of social cooperation and the common good.\n\nOption C claims that justice has value solely because it is useful to society. This is similar to B but goes further by saying that social utility is the only basis for justice's value. Hume might agree with this, as he saw moral sentiments as evolving to promote the interests of society.\n\nOption D suggests that justice has value solely because it is useful to the agent. This seems more like a form of ethical egoism, where moral actions are justified based on self-interest. While Hume did discuss self-interest, I don't think he held that justice is valuable only for the agent's benefit.\n\nI need to think more deeply about Hume's view on justice. In \"Treatise,\" he discusses how moral sentiments like justice and injustice arise from our natural sympathies and are shaped by social conventions. He argues that justice is necessary for the stability and cooperation in society.\n\nMoreover, Hume introduces the idea that justice is an \"artificial\" virtue, meaning it's not based on direct moral sentiments but is instead constructed by society to regulate interactions and protect property rights.\n\nGiven this, it seems that Hume saw justice as having value primarily because it serves the interests of society. Without justice, there would be chaos, and people couldn't rely on each other's promises or property rights.\n\nSo, between options B and C, I'm leaning towards C, which says justice has value solely because it is useful to society. Hume seems to emphasize the social utility of justice more than any partial value.\n\nBut wait, option B says \"in part,\" which might imply that there are other reasons for justice's value besides social utility. If I recall correctly, Hume did think that justice is grounded in our natural sympathies and moral sentiments, which might suggest that there's more to it than just social utility.\n\nMaybe I need to consider both aspects. Justice has value because it aligns with our moral sentiments and because it's useful for society. In that case, option B would be more accurate, as it says \"in part\" because of social utility.\n\nHowever, I think Hume would argue that the primary reason for justice's value is its utility to society. He saw moral sentiments as tools for promoting the general welfare, so perhaps option C is closer to his view.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose there's a situation where enforcing justice would benefit society as a whole but might not be in the best interest of the individual agent. For instance, if someone steals to feed their starving family, justice would require punishment, which might not be in the agent's best interest but is necessary for maintaining social order.\n\nThis seems to support the idea that justice is valued for the sake of society, not just for the benefit of the agent.\n\nOn the other hand, Hume did emphasize the role of sympathy in moral judgments. He thought that we have natural sympathies towards others, which lead us to care about their welfare and to develop moral sentiments like justice.\n\nSo, perhaps justice has value both because it aligns with our sympathies and because it's useful for society. In that case, option B might be the best choice, as it acknowledges that social utility is part of justice's value without claiming it's the sole basis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Hume would argue that our sympathies are themselves shaped by social utility, so in the end, social utility is the fundamental source of justice's value.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to summarize:\n\n- Hume saw justice as an artificial virtue, based on social conventions.\n\n- It's necessary for regulating interactions and protecting property rights.\n\n- Justice is valued for promoting the general welfare and social cooperation.\n\n- Moral sentiments, including justice, are grounded in our natural sympathies.\n\nGiven this, I think option C is the closest to Hume's view: justice has value solely because it is useful to society.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure. Maybe I should look up some specific quotes from Hume to confirm.\n\nIn \"Treatise,\" Hume writes: \"Justice and injustice are qualities which affect what is ours, and enter into composition with our rights and property.\" He also says that justice is \"a virtue, which arises merely from the utility of its effects to society.\"\n\nThis seems to support option C: justice is valuable solely because it's useful to society.\n\nHowever, he also talks about how our moral sentiments lead us to approve of just actions and disapprove of unjust ones, which suggests that there's more to it than just social utility.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to distinguish between the basis of justice and its value. Hume might argue that the basis of justice is social utility, but that doesn't mean that its value is solely derived from that utility.\n\nOption B says \"in part,\" which might allow for other factors contributing to justice's value, such as our moral sentiments.\n\nI think the key here is understanding whether Hume saw social utility as the only source of justice's value or just as a primary one.\n\nGiven his emphasis on the artificial nature of justice and its role in society, I'm leaning towards option C: justice has value solely because it is useful to society.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider whether Hume might have allowed for intrinsic value in justice, independent of its utility.\n\nI don't think so. Hume was a proponent of utilitarian ideas, believing that the consequences of actions determine their moral worth.\n\nTherefore, I believe the best answer is option C: justice has value solely because it is useful to society.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
