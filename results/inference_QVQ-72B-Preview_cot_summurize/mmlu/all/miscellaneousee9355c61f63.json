Hmm, I need to remember who wrote those two epic poems.\n\nFirst off, I know that 'The Iliad' and 'The Odyssey' are both ancient Greek epic poems. They're really famous and considered cornerstones of Western literature or something like that. But who wrote them? Let me think.\n\nI think Homer is often associated with these poems. Wait, but was Homer a real person? I seem to recall that there's some debate about whether Homer actually existed or if he was just a legend. But regardless, he's traditionally credited with writing 'The Iliad' and 'The Odyssey.'\n\nLet me consider the other options to make sure. Sophocles was a playwright, right? He wrote tragedies like 'Oedipus Rex' and 'Antigone.' So, he was more into plays rather than epic poems.\n\nPlato was a philosopher, famous for his dialogues featuring Socrates. He wrote about philosophy, not epic poetry. Speaking of Socrates, he was also a philosopher, but he didn't write anything himself as far as I know. His ideas were recorded by Plato and others.\n\nSo, based on this, Homer seems to be the one traditionally credited with writing 'The Iliad' and 'The Odyssey.' Even if there's uncertainty about who Homer was or if he existed, he's still the name attached to those works.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Is there any chance that someone else could have written them? Well, these poems are part of oral tradition, meaning they were passed down through generations by bards before being written down. So, maybe multiple people contributed to them over time. But again, Homer is the figure traditionally associated with their composition.\n\nI don't think it's Sophocles, because he was more known for his plays. Plato was a philosopher, and Socrates was his teacher, also a philosopher. Neither of them wrote epic poems.\n\nLet me see if I can recall any specific details about Homer. I think he was supposed to have been a blind poet, but I'm not sure if that's just a legend or not. The important thing is that 'The Iliad' and 'The Odyssey' are attributed to him.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider the time periods. 'The Iliad' and 'The Odyssey' are set in the Trojan War era, which is thought to be around the 12th century BCE. Homer is believed to have lived around the 8th century BCE, which makes sense because written literature started to develop around that time in Greece.\n\nSophocles lived from about 496 to 406 BCE, which is later than Homer. Plato was born around 428/427 BCE, and Socrates was born around 470 BCE. So, their times don't align with the composition of the epics.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, the correct answer should be C. Homer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
