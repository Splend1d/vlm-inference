                    "text": "So I have this economics problem here. It says that nominal GDP is $6000 and the GDP deflator is 200, and I need to find the real GDP. The options are $30, $3,000, $12,000, and $1,200. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on GDP concepts, but let's see.\n\nI remember that nominal GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced in a country valued at current prices. Real GDP, on the other hand, is adjusted for inflation and reflects the value using base-year prices. The GDP deflator is a measure of inflation, and it relates nominal GDP to real GDP.\n\nThe formula to calculate real GDP using the GDP deflator is:\n\nReal GDP = Nominal GDP / (GDP deflator / 100)\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nReal GDP = $6000 / (200 / 100) = $6000 / 2 = $3000\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. If the GDP deflator is 200, that means prices are twice as high as the base year. So, to find the real GDP, I need to adjust the nominal GDP for this inflation.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the GDP deflator is expressed as an index with a base year of 100. So, if it's 200, it means prices are twice as high as the base year. Therefore, to find real GDP, I need to divide the nominal GDP by the deflator and multiply by 100.\n\nReal GDP = Nominal GDP \u00d7 (100 / GDP deflator) = $6000 \u00d7 (100 / 200) = $6000 \u00d7 0.5 = $3000\n\nOkay, that matches my initial calculation. So, the real GDP is $3,000.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way to think about it. Maybe using the quantity theory of money or something, but that seems unrelated here. No, I think the direct approach is correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the units. Is the GDP in millions or billions? No, the question just says $6000, so I assume it's in dollars, and the deflator is 200, so no need to adjust for scaling.\n\nSo, according to the formula, real GDP is $3,000. That would be option B.\n\nBut the question is multiple-choice, and $3,000 is one of the options. Maybe there's a trick here, or perhaps I missed something.\n\nLet me consider if the deflator is inverted or something, but no, the formula is standard as real GDP equals nominal GDP divided by the deflator times 100.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes real GDP is calculated as nominal GDP times the deflator divided by 100, but that doesn't make sense because that would give $6000 \u00d7 (200 / 100) = $12,000, which is option C, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. If the deflator is 200, meaning prices are twice as high as the base year, then real GDP should be lower than nominal GDP, not higher. So, $12,000 doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me try another approach. Suppose the base year's real GDP is X, and the deflator is 200, meaning prices are twice as high as the base year. So, nominal GDP would be real GDP times the price level, which is 2.\n\nSo, nominal GDP = 2 \u00d7 real GDP\n\nTherefore, real GDP = nominal GDP / 2 = $6000 / 2 = $3000\n\nYes, that confirms my initial calculation.\n\nI think the answer is $3,000, which is option B.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect this calculation. If there's population growth or changes in the price level, but the problem doesn't provide any additional information, so I think it's safe to stick with the formula.\n\nAlso, sometimes questions can be tricky by including units or scaling factors, but since no units are specified, I assume it's in dollars.\n\nSo, my final answer is $3,000, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3000} \\]"
