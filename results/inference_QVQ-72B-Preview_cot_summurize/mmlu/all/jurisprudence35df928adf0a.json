                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Who says that 'Social Contract is not a historical fact but a hypothetical construction of reason'?\" And the options are A. Hobbes, B. Locke, C. Thomas Aquinas, D. Rousseau.\n\nAlright, let's see. I remember learning about the social contract theory in philosophy class. It's this idea that people agree to give up some freedoms in order to have order and protection from a government or society. But the question is specifically about who thought that the social contract isn't a historical fact but something made up by reason.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what a social contract is. It's a concept where individuals consent, either explicitly or implicitly, to surrender some of their freedoms and submit to the authority of the ruler or government in exchange for protection of their remaining rights.\n\nNow, the question says that this social contract isn't a historical fact but a hypothetical construction of reason. So, it's not something that actually happened in history, like people getting together and signing a contract, but rather it's a theoretical idea that helps us understand how societies and governments work.\n\nI need to figure out which philosopher among these options held this view.\n\nLet me think about Hobbes first. I recall that Hobbes wrote \"Leviathan,\" where he discusses the social contract. He believed that life without government would be chaotic, and people agreed to form a social contract to avoid that. But I think he presented it as something that happened historically, like people coming together to form a commonwealth. So, maybe he did consider it a historical fact? Hmm.\n\nNext, Locke. I know Locke also had ideas about the social contract. He believed in natural rights and that government's purpose is to protect those rights. Did he think of the social contract as a literal historical event, or more of an idea?\n\nThomas Aquinas was a medieval philosopher and theologian. I'm not as familiar with his views on the social contract, but I think his focus was more on natural law and ethics within Christianity. Maybe not the primary figure associated with the social contract theory.\n\nThen there's Rousseau. He's famous for his book \"The Social Contract,\" where he discusses the idea in depth. I remember he talked about the \"general will\" and how the social contract is an agreement among citizens to be governed by this general will. Now, I think he viewed the social contract as more of a theoretical construct rather than something that actually occurred in history.\n\nWait, but the question says that the social contract is \"not a historical fact but a hypothetical construction of reason.\" So, it's not about whether the social contract is a good idea or not, but about how the philosopher understood its nature.\n\nLet me consider Rousseau's writings. In \"The Social Contract,\" does he present it as something that happened in the past, or as an ideal that should be strived for?\n\nI think he presents it as an ideal, a way that society should be organized, rather than describing an event that already took place. So, maybe he saw it as a hypothetical construction.\n\nBut let me double-check with Hobbes and Locke.\n\nHobbes, in \"Leviathan,\" does seem to describe the social contract as something that people agreed upon to escape the state of nature, which was \"nasty, brutish, and short.\" Did he think this agreement actually happened, or was it a thought experiment?\n\nI think Hobbes saw it as a necessary step in the formation of society and government, implying that it was a real agreement made by people at some point in history.\n\nLocke, on the other hand, also discusses the social contract in the context of people leaving the state of nature to form a civil society. But I think he too presented it as a process that occurred historically, even if it was an abstracted version of events.\n\nThomas Aquinas, while he did write about law and governance, doesn't seem to be the primary figure associated with the social contract theory in the same way that Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau are.\n\nSo, bringing it back to Rousseau, his \"Social Contract\" is all about the agreement among citizens to form a society governed by the general will. He emphasizes that this contract is a moral and lawful bond, not necessarily a legal document signed by individuals.\n\nGiven that, it seems like Rousseau viewed the social contract as a principle or an ideal, not as a specific historical event.\n\nMoreover, the phrase \"not a historical fact but a hypothetical construction of reason\" aligns well with Rousseau's emphasis on the social contract as an idealized agreement that reflects rational thought about the best way to organize society.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. Rousseau.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll quickly check if any of the other philosophers are known for viewing the social contract as purely hypothetical rather than historical.\n\nHobbes: Likely saw it as historical.\n\nLocke: Also saw it as historical, though perhaps more as a gradual process.\n\nThomas Aquinas: Not directly associated with the social contract in this context.\n\nRousseau: Emphasized the social contract as an ideal and a principle, not a historical event.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. Rousseau.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
