                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem where an investment of $4000 grows at a rate given by 320*e^(0.08t) dollars per year after t years. I need to find its value after 10 years. The options are A. $4,902, B. $8,902, C. $7,122, and D. $12,902.\n\nHmm, I remember that the general formula for exponential growth is A = P * e^(rt), where P is the principal amount, r is the rate, and t is the time in years. But here, the growth rate is given as 320*e^(0.08t), which seems a bit different. Maybe I need to integrate this rate to find the total amount after 10 years.\n\nWait, let's think about this. If the growth rate is 320*e^(0.08t) per year, then the differential equation describing the growth would be something like dA/dt = 320*e^(0.08t), where A is the amount at time t. To find A after 10 years, I probably need to integrate this rate from t=0 to t=10.\n\nSo, let's set up the integral. The initial amount is $4000, so I can write the integral as:\n\nA(t) = \u222b(from 0 to t) [320*e^(0.08\u03c4)] d\u03c4 + 4000\n\nWait, actually, since the rate is 320*e^(0.08t), and the initial amount is $4000, the amount at time t should be the integral of the rate from 0 to t, plus the initial amount.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Now, I need to compute that integral.\n\nFirst, let's compute the integral of 320*e^(0.08\u03c4) with respect to \u03c4 from 0 to t.\n\n\u222b(from 0 to t) 320*e^(0.08\u03c4) d\u03c4\n\nI can factor out the constant 320:\n\n320 * \u222b(from 0 to t) e^(0.08\u03c4) d\u03c4\n\nNow, the integral of e^(k\u03c4) d\u03c4 is (1/k)e^(k\u03c4), where k is a constant.\n\nSo, \u222b e^(0.08\u03c4) d\u03c4 = (1/0.08)e^(0.08\u03c4) = 12.5 e^(0.08\u03c4)\n\nTherefore, the definite integral from 0 to t is:\n\n320 * [12.5 e^(0.08t) - 12.5 e^(0.08*0)] = 320 * [12.5 e^(0.08t) - 12.5]\n\nSimplify that:\n\n320 * 12.5 (e^(0.08t) - 1)\n\nLet me calculate 320 * 12.5 first:\n\n320 * 12.5 = 4000\n\nSo, A(t) = 4000 (e^(0.08t) - 1) + 4000\n\nWait, that simplifies to:\n\nA(t) = 4000 * [e^(0.08t) - 1 + 1] = 4000 * e^(0.08t)\n\nInteresting, so the amount function is A(t) = 4000 * e^(0.08t)\n\nThat seems familiar. It's similar to the standard exponential growth formula.\n\nNow, I need to find A(10):\n\nA(10) = 4000 * e^(0.08*10) = 4000 * e^0.8\n\nNow, e^0.8 is approximately...\n\nI know that e \u2248 2.71828, so e^0.8 \u2248 2.71828^0.8\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, e^0.8 is the same as (e^1)^0.8, which is e^(8/10) = e^(4/5)\n\nBut maybe I should look for a calculator value.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the approximation e^x \u2248 1 + x + (x^2)/2! + (x^3)/3! + ...\n\nBut for x=0.8, that might not be the quickest way.\n\nLet me see, e^0.8 \u2248 2.2255\n\nWait, I think e^0.8 is approximately 2.2255, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can recall that e^0.5 \u2248 1.6487, and e^0.8 is a bit more than that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that e^0.8 = (e^0.2)^4, but e^0.2 \u2248 1.2214, and raising that to the fourth power might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a calculator for e^0.8.\n\nAssuming I have e^0.8 \u2248 2.2255, then:\n\nA(10) = 4000 * 2.2255 = 8902\n\nLooking back at the options, B. $8,902 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the other options, A. $4,902 seems too low, C. $7,122 is less than $8,902, and D. $12,902 is higher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should verify my calculations.\n\nWait, let me double-check the integral.\n\nI had A(t) = \u222b(from 0 to t) 320*e^(0.08\u03c4) d\u03c4 + 4000\n\nWhich I computed as 4000 * (e^(0.08t) - 1) + 4000 = 4000 * e^(0.08t)\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the growth rate is the derivative of the amount function.\n\nIf dA/dt = 320*e^(0.08t), then integrating both sides with respect to t gives A(t) = \u222b 320*e^(0.08t) dt + C\n\nWhich is 4000*e^(0.08t) + C\n\nGiven that A(0) = 4000, plugging in t=0:\n\n4000 = 4000*e^(0) + C \u21d2 4000 = 4000*1 + C \u21d2 C = 0\n\nTherefore, A(t) = 4000 * e^(0.08t)\n\nSo, A(10) = 4000 * e^(0.8)\n\nNow, calculating e^0.8:\n\nUsing a calculator, e^0.8 \u2248 2.2255\n\nTherefore, A(10) \u2248 4000 * 2.2255 = 8902\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. $8,902\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if there's another way to interpret the growth rate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the growth rate is not the derivative of the amount, but something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the growth rate is the annual increase in value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the differential equation is dA/dt = 320*e^(0.08t)\n\nThen, integrating from t=0 to t, A(t) - A(0) = \u222b(from 0 to t) 320*e^(0.08\u03c4) d\u03c4\n\nWhich again brings me to A(t) = 4000 * e^(0.08t)\n\nTherefore, confirming that A(10) = 4000 * e^(0.8) \u2248 8902\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. $8,902\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 8902} \\]"
