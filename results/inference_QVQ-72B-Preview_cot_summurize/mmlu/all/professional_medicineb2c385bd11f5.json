                    "text": "So I'm here with this case about a 79-year-old woman who's been admitted to a nursing facility three months ago after being treated for congestive heart failure at the hospital. Her daughter moved away, and she can't live independently anymore. She's on furosemide and digoxin, and she's lost 3.5 kg, which is like 7 pounds, in the past three months. The nurse says she's a \"poor eater,\" and when I talked to her, she said she's not depressed but just doesn't have an appetite. She also mentioned that nothing tastes good and she feels a bit nauseous most of the time. Now, I need to figure out what's the best initial diagnostic test to order.\n\nFirst, I should consider her medical history. She has congestive heart failure (CHF), for which she's taking furosemide, which is a diuretic, and digoxin, which helps with heart function. She was hospitalized for CHF three months ago and then moved to the nursing home. Her daughter isn't around, which might affect her emotional state, but she denies being depressed.\n\nShe's lost weight\u20143.5 kg in three months. That's a significant amount, especially for someone who might not have a lot of extra weight. Weight loss in elderly patients can be a sign of various issues, including poor nutrition, underlying disease, or side effects from medications.\n\nShe mentions she doesn't have an appetite, nothing tastes good, and she feels nauseous often. These symptoms suggest possible issues with her digestive system, her sense of taste, or perhaps her medication is causing these symptoms.\n\nI need to think about possible causes for her anorexia and weight loss. Anorexia in elderly patients can be due to multiple factors:\n\n1. **Psychological factors:** Depression is common in elderly patients, especially those in nursing homes, but she denies being depressed.\n\n2. **Medication side effects:** Both furosemide and digoxin can cause nausea and appetite changes.\n\n3. **Chronic diseases:** CHF itself can affect appetite, and she might have other undiagnosed conditions.\n\n4. **Dental problems:** Poor dental health can make eating difficult, but I don't have information about that.\n\n5. **Nutritional deficiencies:** Weight loss can lead to deficiencies that further decrease appetite.\n\nGiven that she's on digoxin, I should consider checking her digoxin levels to make sure they're not too high, as high digoxin levels can cause nausea and anorexia.\n\nAlso, since she has CHF, her renal function might be compromised, which could affect medication metabolism and excretion, leading to accumulation and side effects.\n\nLet me think about the options provided:\n\n**A. Chest X-ray**\n\nA chest X-ray can help assess her heart size and lung fields, which might be relevant for her CHF, but it's not directly related to her anorexia and weight loss.\n\n**B. Complete blood count (CBC)**\n\nA CBC can check for anemia, which can cause fatigue and sometimes affect appetite, but again, it's not specifically targeted to her current symptoms.\n\n**C. Determination of serum albumin concentration**\n\nSerum albumin is a protein in the blood that can indicate nutritional status. Low albumin levels can suggest malnutrition, which aligns with her weight loss and poor appetite. However, albumin levels can also be affected by other factors, like inflammation and liver function.\n\n**D. Determination of serum digoxin level**\n\nGiven that she's on digoxin and experiencing nausea and anorexia, which are side effects of digoxin toxicity, checking her digoxin level seems pertinent. This would help rule out whether her symptoms are due to high digoxin levels.\n\nI need to prioritize the most appropriate initial diagnostic study. Considering her medication use and the symptoms she's describing, checking her digoxin level seems like a straightforward and relevant first step.\n\nBut, I should also consider other tests that might be necessary down the line, such as thyroid function tests, since hypothyroidism can cause weight loss and anorexia, especially in the elderly. However, among the given options, D seems the most directly relevant.\n\nWait, maybe I should also consider checking her renal function, given her CHF and medication use, but that's not one of the options.\n\nLet me see if there's any other information that might influence my decision.\n\nShe was admitted three months ago, and she's already lost 3.5 kg in that time. That's a pretty rapid weight loss, which makes it urgent to find out the cause.\n\nHer physical examination is normal except for the weight loss, which suggests that there might not be any obvious signs of infection or other acute issues.\n\nGiven that, I think the best initial step is to check her serum digoxin level to ensure that her medication isn't causing her symptoms.\n\nIf her digoxin level is elevated, that would explain her nausea and anorexia, and adjustments to her medication could potentially resolve her symptoms.\n\nIf it's within normal limits, then I might need to consider other tests, but for now, I believe option D is the most appropriate initial diagnostic study.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nDetermination of serum digoxin level\n\n**Answer**\n\nD"
