                    "text": "Let's dive into this question. So, the passage is from \"The Epic of Gilgamesh,\" which is really old, like 2100 B.C.E. old. It's about Gilgamesh, who was a king of Uruk. The first paragraph talks about how the gods made Gilgamesh, giving him a perfect form and bestowing upon him glory and courage. It also mentions that he's two-thirds god and one-third man. Wow, that's interesting.\n\nSo, the question is asking how this description of Gilgamesh most directly supports a statement about ancient leaders. Specifically, it's about the first paragraph, which focuses on Gilgamesh's divine attributes and his role in building the city of Uruk.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Ancient leaders were valued for their mastery of complicated legal codes.\n\nHmm, the passage doesn't mention anything about legal codes. It's more about his divine origin and his role in constructing the city walls and temples. So, this seems off-track.\n\nB. Ancient leaders were expected to be experts of animal husbandry.\n\nAnimal husbandry? That's about raising and taking care of animals. Again, nothing in this paragraph suggests that Gilgamesh was an expert in that. It's more about his divine nature and his achievements in building the city. Maybe in other parts of the epic, but not in this paragraph.\n\nC. Ancient leaders were given divine origins to bolster their legitimacy.\n\nThis seems promising. The passage explicitly says that Gilgamesh is two-thirds god and one-third man, and that the gods gave him glory, courage, and a perfect form. This seems to suggest that his divine attributes were meant to enhance his standing and authority as a leader.\n\nD. Ancient leaders were not judged on their appearances.\n\nBut wait, the passage says that the gods gave him a \"perfect form,\" which implies that his appearance was considered ideal or divine. So, maybe appearances were important. This option suggests the opposite, so I think it's incorrect based on the information provided.\n\nGiven these options, C seems to be the most directly supported by the information in the first paragraph. It talks about Gilgamesh's divine attributes and his connection to the gods, which likely contributed to his legitimacy as a leader in ancient times.\n\nBut let me double-check. The first paragraph mentions that the gods fashioned Gilgamesh, gave him glory and courage, and that he is two-thirds god and one-third man. It also talks about him building the great rampart of Uruk and the wall of the sacred Eanna temple. All of these seem to reinforce his connection to the divine and his role as a leader chosen by the gods.\n\nOption C states that ancient leaders were given divine origins to bolster their legitimacy. This seems to align perfectly with what's described in the passage. By attributing divine characteristics to Gilgamesh, the ancient Mesopotamians were likely elevating his status and justifying his rule.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Ancient leaders were given divine origins to bolster their legitimacy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
