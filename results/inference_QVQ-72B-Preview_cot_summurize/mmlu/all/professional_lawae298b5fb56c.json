                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to advise the driver on how to respond to the negligence action filed against them by the pedestrian. Let me try to understand all the parts involved.\n\nFirst, the pedestrian is from State A but was crossing a street in State B when hit by the driver, who is a citizen of a foreign country. Both were injured, but the pedestrian is suing the driver in a federal district court in State B for $100,000. The driver thinks the pedestrian was crossing illegally and should be responsible for the accident. Also, State B is a contributory negligence state.\n\nOkay, so contributory negligence is a legal doctrine where if the plaintiff is found to be even slightly at fault for the accident, they can't recover any damages. But I think this might be changing, and some states have moved to comparative negligence, but the problem says State B is a contributory negligence state.\n\nSo, the driver wants to defend against this lawsuit, and maybe even counterclaim for their own injuries. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. File an answer raising the affirmative defense of contributory negligence and asserting a counterclaim for negligence, seeking damages for the driver's injuries.\n\nB. File an answer raising the affirmative defense of contributory negligence and defense of contributory negligence and move for judgment on the pleadings.\n\nC. Move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, because the driver is not a citizen of State B.\n\nD. Move to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, because the driver is not a U.S. citizen.\n\nAlright, let's tackle these one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: filing an answer with an affirmative defense and a counterclaim.\n\nI remember that in a lawsuit, the defendant can file an answer to respond to the plaintiff's allegations. In this answer, they can admit, deny, or qualify the claims made against them. Additionally, they can raise affirmative defenses, which are reasons why the plaintiff shouldn't win, even if their allegations are true.\n\nContributory negligence is an affirmative defense because it's something the defendant has to prove to reduce or eliminate the plaintiff's recovery.\n\nAlso, the driver wants to assert a counterclaim for their own injuries, claiming that the pedestrian was negligent by crossing illegally, which caused the accident.\n\nThis seems like a straightforward way to defend against the lawsuit and seek compensation for their own injuries.\n\nNow, option B mentions filing an answer with both an affirmative defense and a defense of contributory negligence, and also moving for judgment on the pleadings.\n\nWait, is there a difference between an affirmative defense and a defense? I think in legal terms, an affirmative defense is a specific type of defense that the defendant has to raise in their answer.\n\nSo, maybe the phrasing here is a bit confusing. Perhaps it's a typo, and it should be \"file an answer raising the affirmative defense of contributory negligence and then move for judgment on the pleadings.\"\n\nJudgment on the pleadings is a motion where a party asks the court to decide the case based on the pleadings alone, without going to trial, arguing that even if everything the plaintiff says is true, they're not entitled to relief.\n\nBut in this case, since contributory negligence is an affirmative defense, the driver would need to prove that the pedestrian was negligent, which might not be something that can be determined just from the pleadings.\n\nSo, maybe this option isn't the best approach.\n\nMoving on to option C: moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction because the driver isn't a citizen of State B.\n\nPersonal jurisdiction refers to whether the court has the power to make a binding decision over the defendant. Typically, courts have personal jurisdiction over defendants who are present in the state, or who have sufficient minimum contacts with the state such that it's fair to subject them to the state's courts.\n\nIn this scenario, the accident occurred in State B, so the driver was present in State B at the time of the accident, which might be enough to establish personal jurisdiction.\n\nAdditionally, since the driver was driving in State B, they might have consented to the state's jurisdiction by operating their vehicle there.\n\nSo, unless there's something unusual about the driver's connection to State B, moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction might not be successful.\n\nOption D suggests moving to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because the driver is not a U.S. citizen.\n\nSubject-matter jurisdiction concerns whether the court has the authority to hear the type of case brought before it.\n\nIn federal courts, subject-matter jurisdiction is typically based on federal questions or diversity of citizenship.\n\nIn this case, the pedestrian is from State A, and the driver is from a foreign country. The accident occurred in State B, and the case is filed in federal district court in State B.\n\nFor diversity jurisdiction, there needs to be complete diversity between the parties and the amount in controversy must exceed $75,000.\n\nHere, the pedestrian is from State A, the driver is from a foreign country, so there is diversity of citizenship. The amount in controversy is $100,000, which meets the threshold.\n\nTherefore, the federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction based on diversity.\n\nSo, moving to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction wouldn't be appropriate in this scenario.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems that option A is the most appropriate course of action.\n\nBy filing an answer with an affirmative defense of contributory negligence and asserting a counterclaim for negligence, the driver is directly addressing the plaintiff's claims and also seeking compensation for their own injuries.\n\nThis approach allows the driver to present their side of the story and potentially reduce or eliminate the pedestrian's damage award if they can prove the pedestrian was negligent.\n\nAdditionally, in a contributory negligence state like State B, if the driver can show that the pedestrian was even slightly at fault, the pedestrian might be barred from recovering any damages.\n\nSo, advising the driver to file an answer raising contributory negligence as an affirmative defense and asserting a counterclaim for negligence seems like the best strategy.\n\nI don't think options B, C, or D are as strong in this context.\n\nOption B involves moving for judgment on the pleadings, which might not be feasible since contributory negligence is a factual issue that would likely require evidence beyond the pleadings.\n\nOption C, moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, isn't supported by the facts provided, as the driver was present in State B at the time of the accident.\n\nOption D, moving to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, is incorrect because diversity jurisdiction exists based on the parties' citizenship and the amount in controversy.\n\nTherefore, the attorney should advise the driver to choose option A: file an answer raising the affirmative defense of contributory negligence and asserting a counterclaim for negligence, seeking damages for the driver's injuries.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
