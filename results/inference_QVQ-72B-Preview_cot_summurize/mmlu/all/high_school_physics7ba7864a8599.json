                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a cyclical process for an ideal gas consisting of three steps: an isobaric step, followed by an isochoric step, and then an isothermal step. We need to figure out which statement about the change in internal energy or the work done during the cycle is true.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic principles about thermodynamic processes for ideal gases. For an ideal gas, the internal energy depends only on the temperature, not on pressure or volume. So, in a cyclical process, if we start and end at the same point, the change in internal energy should be zero, right? Because the temperature would have to return to its initial value in a cycle.\n\nWait, but let's confirm that. The internal energy (U) of an ideal gas is a function of temperature only: U = nCvT, where n is the number of moles, Cv is the molar specific heat at constant volume, and T is the temperature. So, in a cyclical process, since the gas returns to its initial state, T must return to its initial value. Therefore, \u0394U = 0 for the entire cycle.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. The change in internal energy of the gas is equal to the work done during the isobaric step.\n\nBut since \u0394U = 0 for the entire cycle, this would imply that the work done during the isobaric step is zero, which doesn't make sense because in an isobaric process, work is done. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nB. The change in internal energy of the gas is equal to the work done during the isobaric step minus the work done during the isothermal step.\n\nAgain, \u0394U = 0, so this would suggest that the work done in the isobaric step minus the work done in the isothermal step is zero. But without knowing the signs and magnitudes of these works, it's hard to say. Maybe I need to think about the signs of work in these processes.\n\nIn an isobaric process, if the volume increases, work is done by the gas (positive work), and if volume decreases, work is done on the gas (negative work). The work done in an isobaric process is W = P\u0394V.\n\nIn an isothermal process, for an ideal gas, if the volume increases, temperature decreases (but wait, for an isothermal process, temperature is constant by definition), actually, in an isothermal process, temperature remains constant, and work is done by the gas if volume increases (W = nRT ln(Vf/Vi)).\n\nBut in this problem, we have an isothermal step following an isochoric step following an isobaric step. I need to think about the direction of these steps.\n\nMaybe I should sketch a PV diagram to visualize the cycle. Let's see:\n\n1. Isobaric step: constant pressure, volume changes, let's say volume increases, so work done by the gas (positive W).\n\n2. Isochoric step: constant volume, pressure changes, temperature changes since P and T are related for constant volume (P \u221d T). If volume is constant and pressure decreases, temperature decreases.\n\n3. Isothermal step: constant temperature, volume and pressure change in such a way that PV = constant.\n\nSo, starting from point A, isobaric step to point B, then isochoric step to point C, then isothermal step back to point A.\n\nWait, in a cyclical process, it must return to the starting point, so the isothermal step should bring it back to the starting point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to consider the sequence step by step and calculate the work done in each step.\n\nLet's assume the cycle goes through states A, B, C, and back to A.\n\nStep 1: Isobaric step from A to B.\n\nStep 2: Isochoric step from B to C.\n\nStep 3: Isothermal step from C back to A.\n\nWe need to find expressions for work done in each step.\n\nFirst, isobaric step A to B:\n\nWork done by the gas is W1 = P\u0394V, where \u0394V is the change in volume.\n\nSecond, isochoric step B to C:\n\nWork done is W2 = 0, because volume is constant, so no work is done.\n\nThird, isothermal step C to A:\n\nWork done by the gas is W3 = nRT ln(Vf/Vi), but since it's isothermal, T is constant, and since it's a cycle, state A and C have the same T.\n\nWait, actually, in a cyclical process, the final state must be the same as the initial state, so T_A = T_C.\n\nBut in the isothermal step from C to A, if it's isothermal, T is constant, and volume changes such that PV = constant.\n\nNow, for the entire cycle, the total work done is the sum of the works done in each step: W_total = W1 + W2 + W3.\n\nGiven that \u0394U = 0 for the cycle, we can use the first law of thermodynamics: \u0394U = Q - W, so for the entire cycle, 0 = Q - W, which means Q = W.\n\nBut let's see what the options are saying.\n\nOption C says the total work done during the cycle is positive.\n\nOption D says the total work done during the cycle is equal but opposite to the net amount of heat transferred.\n\nFrom the first law, Q = W, so if Q is positive, W is positive; if Q is negative, W is negative. But in option D, it says \"equal but opposite,\" which would imply Q = -W, which contradicts \u0394U = 0 unless W = 0, which isn't necessarily true.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's think again.\n\nFrom the first law: \u0394U = Q - W.\n\nFor a cycle, \u0394U = 0, so Q = W.\n\nTherefore, the net heat absorbed by the gas during the cycle is equal to the net work done by the gas during the cycle.\n\nSo, Q_net = W_net.\n\nTherefore, option D is incorrect as it says W is equal but opposite to Q, which would be Q = -W, but according to the first law for a cycle, Q = W.\n\nNow, option C says the total work done during the cycle is positive.\n\nFrom the earlier equation, W_total = W1 + W2 + W3.\n\nWe have W2 = 0.\n\nSo, W_total = W1 + W3.\n\nNow, need to determine the signs of W1 and W3.\n\nIn the isobaric step, if volume increases, W1 is positive (work done by the gas).\n\nIn the isothermal step, depending on the direction, W3 could be positive or negative.\n\nBut since it's a cycle, and we need to close the loop, let's think about the directions.\n\nLet's assume in the isobaric step, volume increases, so W1 is positive.\n\nIn the isochoric step, no work is done.\n\nIn the isothermal step, to close the cycle, volume would need to change in a way that brings the gas back to the starting point.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nLet's consider the PV diagram for this cycle.\n\nStep 1: Isobaric step (constant pressure, volume increases, temperature increases).\n\nStep 2: Isochoric step (constant volume, pressure decreases, temperature decreases).\n\nStep 3: Isothermal step (constant temperature, volume decreases, pressure increases back to initial value).\n\nSo, in the PV diagram, starting from point A, horizontal line to the right to point B (isobaric increase in volume), then vertical line down to point C (isochoric decrease in pressure), then a curve back to point A (isothermal decrease in volume).\n\nThe area enclosed by this cycle would represent the net work done by the gas.\n\nIn this case, since the cycle is traversed in a way that work is done by the gas (positive work), option C seems correct.\n\nBut let's check the other options again.\n\nOption A: \u0394U equals work done during the isobaric step.\n\nBut \u0394U = 0 for the cycle, and W1 \u2260 0, so this can't be right.\n\nOption B: \u0394U equals work done during the isobaric step minus work done during the isothermal step.\n\nAgain, \u0394U = 0, so W1 - W3 = 0, but without knowing the signs and magnitudes of W1 and W3, this isn't necessarily true.\n\nOption D: Total work done during the cycle is equal but opposite to the net amount of heat transferred.\n\nAs we saw earlier, from the first law for a cycle, Q = W, so Q and W have the same magnitude and sign. Therefore, Q and W are equal, not equal but opposite. So, option D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct option seems to be C: The total work done during the cycle is positive.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the signs of work in each step.\n\nIn the isobaric step, if volume increases, W1 is positive.\n\nIn the isochoric step, W2 = 0.\n\nIn the isothermal step, if volume decreases, W3 is negative (work done on the gas).\n\nTherefore, W_total = W1 + W3.\n\nSince W1 is positive and W3 is negative, the net work depends on the magnitudes.\n\nHowever, in a cyclical process, the net work done is equal to the area enclosed in the PV diagram, which, in this case, should be positive because the cycle is traversed in a direction where more work is done by the gas than on the gas.\n\nTherefore, option C is correct: The total work done during the cycle is positive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
