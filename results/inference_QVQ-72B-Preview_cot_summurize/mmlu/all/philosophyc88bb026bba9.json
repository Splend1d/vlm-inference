                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this concept of \"prima facie duties\" as per Ross. I have this question here: \"According to Ross, our prima facie duties:\n\nA. can be proven.\n\nB. are self-evident.\n\nC. cannot be known.\n\nD. are not objective.\"\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First off, I need to recall what Ross said about prima facie duties. I remember that Ross was an ethical theorist who proposed a pluralistic deontological ethics, right? He thought that there are multiple basic moral duties that we have, and these are prima facie duties.\n\nNow, prima facie duties are kind of like our initial moral obligations that we consider in a situation. They're not absolute; instead, they can conflict with each other, and in such cases, we have to weigh them against each other to decide what our actual duty is.\n\nSo, given that, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Can be proven. Hmm, does Ross think that these duties can be proven in some way? Like, are they based on empirical evidence or logical deduction? I don't recall Ross emphasizing proof in that sense. Moral duties are more about what we ought to do, which isn't something that can be proven in the same way as a mathematical theorem or a scientific fact.\n\nB. Are self-evident. This seems interesting. Self-evident means that they're clearly true without needing proof. Like, you just know they're right. Ross might have thought that some duties are just intuitively clear to us. For example, the duty to tell the truth or to not harm others might seem self-evident to many people.\n\nC. Cannot be known. This seems contradictory. If we have duties that we cannot know, how can we fulfill them? It doesn't make much sense for duties to be unknown. Ross was a proponent of objective moral truths, so I doubt he would say that our duties cannot be known.\n\nD. Are not objective. This would mean that our duties are subjective or relative. But Ross was an objectivist in ethics; he believed in objective moral values and duties. So, this option doesn't align with his view.\n\nLet me think again. If A is about provability, and Ross didn't think that moral duties are provable in a strict sense, maybe that's a possibility. But I'm not sure. B, self-evident, seems plausible because Ross did emphasize intuition and common sense morality. C seems unlikely because duties that cannot be known wouldn't be very helpful. D contradicts Ross's objectivism.\n\nMaybe I should consider what prima facie means. Prima facie means \"at first glance\" or \"on the face of it.\" So, these are duties that appear to be obligatory at first sight, but might be overridden by stronger duties in certain situations.\n\nGiven that, perhaps Ross thought that these duties are self-evident, meaning that they're clearly obligatory on their face, without needing further justification.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can't be proven, but are just accepted as basic moral requirements.\n\nWait, but if they're self-evident, that suggests they're immediately recognizable as true, which aligns with the idea of prima facie duties being obvious at first glance.\n\nLet me consider some sources or texts by Ross to see what he said about the nature of prima facie duties.\n\nI recall that in his book \"The Right and the Good,\" Ross discusses the nature of prima facie duties. He suggests that there are several such duties, like fidelity, reparation, gratitude, justice, beneficence, and self-improvement.\n\nHe also mentions that these duties are not derived from a single overarching principle but are instead independent and coexist.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best answer is B. are self-evident, because Ross seems to treat these duties as basic and intuitively understandable.\n\nBut let me double-check. If I choose B, am I sure that Ross considered prima facie duties to be self-evident?\n\nWell, self-evident might be a bit strong. Maybe they're not necessarily self-evident in every case, but they are taken as given in his moral framework.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps A. can be proven is a better option. Maybe Ross believed that these duties can be justified through reason and reflection.\n\nBut I think B. are self-evident is a stronger statement, suggesting that these duties are immediately recognizable as true, which aligns with the idea of prima facie duties being obvious at first glance.\n\nSo, I'll go with B. are self-evident.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
