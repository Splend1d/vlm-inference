                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which type of advertising is most common in political campaigns. The options are product-oriented, idea-oriented, person-oriented, and platform-oriented advertising. I need to pick the one that's primarily used in political campaigns, especially because it focuses on raising public awareness about a particular person, with the goal of getting support or not supporting them.\n\nFirst, let's break down each type:\n\nA. Product-oriented advertising: This seems like it's focused on selling a specific product. In politics, sometimes candidates promote policies or initiatives that can be seen as their \"products.\" But it feels like this might not be the primary focus of political campaigns. Political campaigns are more about electing a person rather than selling a tangible product.\n\nB. Idea-oriented advertising: This one is about spreading ideas or ideologies. Political campaigns do involve discussing ideas and platforms, but again, the ultimate goal is to get people to vote for a specific person, not just to spread ideas without any personal attachment. So, while ideas are important, they might not be the main focus.\n\nC. Person-oriented advertising: This sounds exactly like what political campaigns do. They try to build an image around the candidate, highlighting their strengths, experiences, and qualities that make them suitable for office. The aim is to influence public perception of the person so that they will support or not support them based on who they are and what they stand for.\n\nD. Platform-oriented advertising: This seems similar to idea-oriented advertising, focusing on the specific policies or platforms that a candidate supports. While platforms are crucial in political campaigns, they are usually tied to the person running for office. So, again, it might be a part of the overall strategy but not the primary focus.\n\nAfter considering all these, person-oriented advertising seems to be the most fitting answer. Political campaigns are fundamentally about electing individuals to office, and a large part of that involves shaping the public's perception of the candidate's character, trustworthiness, and leadership abilities.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about some examples. In the 2020 U.S. presidential election, both candidates spent a significant amount of time and resources on advertisements that portrayed their opponents negatively and themselves positively. These ads were less about specific policies and more about the personal attributes and past actions of the candidates.\n\nAnother example is the use of biographical ads, which tell the story of the candidate's life, highlighting their background, experiences, and personal qualities that make them qualified for the position. These are clearly person-oriented.\n\nOf course, platforms and policies are also advertised, but often, these are used to support the image of the candidate rather than being the central focus. For instance, a candidate might emphasize their plan to create jobs not just because it's a good policy, but because it shows they are focused on the economy and the well-being of citizens, which reflects positively on their leadership qualities.\n\nAdditionally, negative advertising, which is common in political campaigns, often attacks the character or past actions of opponents rather than their policies. This again points to person-oriented advertising being prevalent.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, I would say that person-oriented advertising is the most common in political campaigns because it directly targets the public's perception of the candidate, aiming to influence their support or lack thereof.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C.
