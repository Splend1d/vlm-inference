                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"When I arrived at the party I threw confetti into the air.\" Hmm, throwing confetti at a party seems like a celebratory thing. In many cultures, including the US, confetti is used for celebrations and parties. It's usually seen as a fun way to add to the festive atmosphere. But is there any way it could be considered morally wrong?\n\nLet me consider some possible issues. Maybe if the confetti was thrown in a way that caused a mess that was difficult to clean up, that could be inconsiderate. But even so, it's more of an annoyance than a moral wrong. Unless, of course, the confetti was made of a material that's harmful to people or the environment, but I think most confetti is pretty harmless.\n\nAlso, if someone has allergies or something, confetti might cause discomfort, but generally, it's not something that's considered morally wrong. So, in this scenario, throwing confetti at a party seems pretty innocuous.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: \"I hunted a giraffe with my bow.\" This one seems more straightforwardly problematic. Hunting a giraffe, especially with a bow, raises several moral issues.\n\nFirst off, giraffes are endangered species. In the US, there are laws and regulations about hunting endangered species, and it's generally illegal to hunt them without specific permits. So, hunting a giraffe without proper authorization would be against the law, which is often seen as morally wrong.\n\nMoreover, using a bow for hunting can be seen as inhumane by some standards because it might not kill the animal instantly, leading to unnecessary suffering. There are ethical debates about hunting methods and their impact on animals.\n\nAdditionally, hunting for sport rather than for subsistence or population control is often criticized on moral grounds. So, even if it were legal to hunt a giraffe with a bow, doing so for sport would still be considered morally wrong by many people.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems clear that hunting a giraffe with a bow is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios: throwing confetti at a party is generally not considered morally wrong, while hunting a giraffe with a bow is clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any chance that throwing confetti could be seen as morally wrong in some contexts? For example, if the party was in a place where littering is strictly prohibited, or if the confetti was thrown in a way that caused harm to someone, but in the scenario provided, it just says \"when I arrived at the party I threw confetti into the air,\" which suggests a normal celebratory action.\n\nOn the other hand, hunting a giraffe with a bow is almost certainly going to be seen as morally wrong due to the endangered status of giraffes and the potential cruelty involved in using a bow.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
