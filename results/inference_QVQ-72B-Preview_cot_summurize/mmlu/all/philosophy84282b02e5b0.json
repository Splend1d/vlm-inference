                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what Hume said about how we make moral judgments. The question is from his Inquiry, and it's about where our final verdicts on moral matters come from. The options are:\n\nA. reason.\n\nB. a moral sense that is unique to each person.\n\nC. a moral sense that is universal in our species.\n\nD. emotion.\n\nOkay, first, I need to recall what Hume said about morality. I remember that Hume was a Scottish philosopher who had some famous ideas about empiricism and skepticism. In his \"Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding,\" he delves into moral philosophy.\n\nLet me think about his famous statement: \"Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.\" This suggests that for Hume, reason alone doesn't drive our moral decisions; rather, our passions or emotions play a crucial role.\n\nSo, option D is emotion. That seems relevant, but let's consider the other options.\n\nOption A is reason. But according to Hume, reason is subordinate to the passions. He thought that reason can help us understand facts and cause and effect, but it doesn't motivate moral actions directly. So, it's unlikely that he would say our final moral verdicts are derived from reason alone.\n\nOption B is a moral sense that is unique to each person. Hume did talk about a \"moral sense,\" but I don't think he believed it was entirely unique to each person. He seemed to think that there were common principles guiding moral judgments across people.\n\nOption C is a moral sense that is universal in our species. This sounds more in line with Hume's views. He believed that humans have a capacity to sympathize with others, which is a fundamental basis for morality. This sympathy is something shared by all humans, suggesting a universal aspect to our moral sense.\n\nBut wait, option D is emotion. Hume did emphasize the role of passion and emotion in moral judgments. He thought that moral distinctions are not derived from reason but from feelings like approval or disapproval.\n\nSo, is the answer C or D? Let me think more carefully.\n\nIf I consider that Hume believed in a moral sense that is common to all humans, based on our capacity for sympathy, then C seems plausible. But he also emphasized that moral judgments are influenced by our emotions and passions.\n\nPerhaps the moral sense he refers to is a universal emotional response or a capacity for feeling certain emotions in response to moral situations.\n\nLet me try to look back at the text of the Inquiry to get a better understanding.\n\nIn the third section of the Inquiry, titled \"Of the Passions,\" Hume discusses the origins of moral evaluations. He argues that moral distinctions are not derived from reason but from reflections on the passions or emotions.\n\nHe writes: \"Moral distinctions, therefore, are not derived from reason, but from sentiment or feeling.\" This seems to align closely with option D, emotion.\n\nBut he also talks about a moral sense, which is akin to our senses of taste and smell, varying somewhat between individuals but also having universal elements.\n\nWait, in his \"Treatise of Human Nature,\" Hume discusses the idea of a moral sense, but in the Inquiry, he might have refined his views.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Hume was critical of the idea that reason could be the foundation of morality. He thought that reason is merely instrumental and serves our passions.\n\nTherefore, our final moral verdicts aren't derived from reason (option A), but from our moral sentiments or emotions.\n\nMoreover, he believed that these moral sentiments are not entirely unique to each person (option B), but have a common basis in our shared capacity for sympathy (option C).\n\nHowever, sympathy itself is an emotion or passion, so it still falls under the broader category of emotion (option D).\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to think about it in terms of both universality and emotional basis.\n\nOption C says a moral sense that is universal in our species. Hume does believe in a universal capacity for sympathy, which is the foundation of our moral senses.\n\nOption D is emotion, which encompasses a wide range of feelings, including sympathy.\n\nBut perhaps Hume would specify that it's a particular type of emotion, namely sympathy, that underlies our moral judgments.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he considered the moral sense to be a faculty separate from general emotions.\n\nLet me check a specific quote from the Inquiry.\n\nIn Part III, Section III, \"Of Moral Sentiment,\" Hume writes: \"As different men, in tasting the same fruit, receive the same sensation, so, when they consider the same action or character, they feel the same moral sentiment.\"\n\nThis suggests that there is a commonality in our moral sentiments, much like in our sensory experiences.\n\nHe also compares the moral sense to the senses of taste and smell, which are shared by all humans, though there can be variations in sensitivity and preference.\n\nTherefore, it seems that Hume believed in a moral sense that is universal in our species, even if there are individual differences.\n\nBut again, this moral sense is based on sentiment or feeling, which aligns with emotion.\n\nSo, between options C and D, I'm still not sure which one best captures Hume's view.\n\nPerhaps the key is to recognize that Hume saw the moral sense as a faculty that is universal in humans, and it operates through emotional responses.\n\nTherefore, our final moral verdicts are derived from a moral sense that is universal in our species (option C), and this moral sense is itself an emotion or sentiment (option D).\n\nBut since the question asks for the primary source of our final moral verdicts, and given that Hume emphasized the universality of the moral sense, option C might be the most accurate.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is interpreted to mean what underlies the moral sense, then emotion would be the answer.\n\nI think I need to consider the context of the question more carefully.\n\nThe question is: \"Our final verdicts on moral matters are derived from:\n\nA. reason.\n\nB. a moral sense that is unique to each person.\n\nC. a moral sense that is universal in our species.\n\nD. emotion.\"\n\nGiven that Hume rejected reason as the basis for moral judgments, option A is out.\n\nHe believed in a moral sense that has some universality, so option B, which suggests it's unique to each person, is unlikely.\n\nBetween options C and D, it's a bit tricky.\n\nIf I consider that the moral sense is a specific type of emotion that is universal, then option C might be more precise, as it captures both the emotional aspect and the universality.\n\nHowever, option D is more general and could encompass the moral sense as a type of emotion.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is C, as it directly refers to a moral sense that is universal, which aligns with Hume's emphasis on sympathy as a common human capacity that underlies moral judgments.\n\nIn summary, Hume argued that our final moral verdicts are derived from a moral sense that is universal in our species, based on our shared capacity for sympathy, which is an emotion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
