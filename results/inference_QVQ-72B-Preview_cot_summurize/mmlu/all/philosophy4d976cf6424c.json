Let me think through each one.\n\nOption A says \"the obtaining of company material without permission.\" Hmm, that sounds like someone is taking information from a company without asking first. That seems unethical, but is it deception? Deception usually involves misleading someone or lying. In this case, it's more about taking something without authorization rather than misleading anyone. Maybe not the best example of deception.\n\nOption B is \"the researcher wearing a disguise during an observation.\" This one is interesting. Wearing a disguise might be a way to blend in or hide the researcher's identity, but does that constitute deception? It's more about anonymity or confidentiality, perhaps to avoid influencing the subjects being observed. I'm not sure if this is considered deception because there might not be any direct interaction where the researcher is lying or misleading someone.\n\nOption C says \"the researcher representing their research as being about a different topic.\" Okay, this seems like a clear case of deception. If the researcher tells participants that the study is about one thing, but it's actually about something else, that's misleading. This could be to prevent bias in the responses, but it's still considered deceptive because the participants are being given false information about the purpose of the research.\n\nOption D is \"the researcher failing to ask permission to interview someone.\" This seems similar to Option A. It's about not getting consent before proceeding, which is unethical, but again, it's more about omission rather than active deception. Failing to ask permission isn't necessarily lying or misleading someone; it's just not following proper procedures.\n\nSo, comparing all four options, Option C seems to be the most straightforward example of deception. The researcher is intentionally misrepresenting the true nature of the research, which involves lying or misleading participants about the purpose of the study.\n\nI think the answer is C. The researcher representing their research as being about a different topic.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
