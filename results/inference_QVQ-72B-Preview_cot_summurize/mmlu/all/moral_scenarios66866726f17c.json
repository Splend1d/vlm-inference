                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Both are wrong.\n\nB. The first is wrong, the second is not.\n\nC. The second is wrong, the first is not.\n\nD. Neither is wrong.\n\nOkay, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I poured the rest of my drink on the kitchen floor.\"\n\nSo, someone had a drink, and instead of finishing it or saving it, they just poured it out on the kitchen floor. Hmm.\n\nFirst off, pouring a drink on the kitchen floor might be wasteful, but is it morally wrong? Well, wasting food or drinks can be seen as irresponsible, especially considering there are people who don't have enough to eat or drink. But is it clearly morally wrong?\n\nI think it depends on the context. If the person couldn't finish the drink because they were full or didn't like it, it might just be a personal choice. But pouring it on the floor could be messy and create extra work for someone who has to clean it up.\n\nMaybe it's more about the intention. If they poured it out of anger or to make a mess, that could be seen as wrong. But if they were just trying to get rid of it without harm, maybe it's not that bad.\n\nI don't think this is clearly morally wrong, at least not based on the information given.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"As an attorney, I don't care if my clients are innocent or not.\"\n\nThis one seems trickier. Attorneys are supposed to represent their clients to the best of their abilities, but they're also officers of the court and have ethical obligations.\n\nIn the US, attorneys are bound by rules of professional conduct, which vary by state, but generally, they have to advocate for their clients' interests within the bounds of the law.\n\nBut does an attorney have to believe in their client's innocence to represent them? Actually, no. The justice system presumes that everyone is innocent until proven guilty, and attorneys are supposed to provide zealous representation regardless of their personal beliefs about guilt or innocence.\n\nSo, if an attorney doesn't care whether their client is innocent or not, but still provides competent representation, is that morally wrong?\n\nI think it's more about upholding the legal process and ensuring that everyone gets a fair trial, regardless of the attorney's personal beliefs.\n\nHowever, if the attorney is indifferent to the client's innocence to the point of not putting in effort or actively harming the case, that would be wrong.\n\nBut based on the statement, it seems like the attorney is indifferent to the client's innocence but is still performing their duties.\n\nSo, in this case, I don't think it's clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, according to my reasoning, neither scenario involves doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, pouring a drink on the kitchen floor might be wasteful or messy, but it's not necessarily morally wrong. It might be more of a personal choice or an inconvenience to others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, an attorney not caring about the client's innocence, but still providing proper representation, aligns with the professional responsibilities of an attorney in the US legal system.\n\nSo, my final answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
