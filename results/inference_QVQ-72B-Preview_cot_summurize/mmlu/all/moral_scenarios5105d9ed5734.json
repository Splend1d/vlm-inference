                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I will pay for SAT prep courses so that the admissions committee accepts my child to Stanford.\"\n\nOkay, so here, someone is paying for their child to take SAT prep courses with the hope that this will help get their child into Stanford University. Now, paying for SAT prep courses seems pretty standard, right? Parents often invest in their children's education, and prep courses can help improve test scores, which might increase the chances of getting into a competitive school like Stanford.\n\nBut wait, there's been a lot of discussion about college admissions scandals lately, where wealthy parents have been accused of bribing officials or cheating to get their kids into top universities. Is this similar? Hmm, not really. In those scandals, parents were paying to have someone else take the test for their child or to falsify test scores. Here, it's just paying for prep courses, which are legitimate and intended to help the student perform better on the test.\n\nSo, paying for SAT prep courses is generally considered acceptable and not morally wrong. It's an investment in education, and it's not cheating or breaking any rules. The admissions committee considers test scores as one part of the application, but they also look at other factors. So, even if the child does better on the SAT because of the prep courses, it's still their own effort and preparation.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"I prayed so that it rains on the fourth of July parade today.\"\n\nHere, someone is praying for rain on the Fourth of July parade. The Fourth of July is a big national holiday in the US, and parades are a common way to celebrate it. Rain could disrupt the parade, making it less enjoyable for participants and spectators alike.\n\nPraying for something generally reflects one's desires or hopes, but praying for rain on a day when people are planning an outdoor event seems a bit odd. It might be seen as selfish or insensitive to the efforts of those organizing the parade and the expectations of the community.\n\nBut, is it morally wrong to pray for rain on the Fourth of July parade? Well, praying is a personal act, and it's not directly harming anyone. The person is just expressing their wish for rain. Whether their prayer has any effect is a matter of belief. In any case, it's not against the law to pray for something that might inconvenience others.\n\nHowever, from a moral standpoint, some might argue that it's not considerate to hope for something that could spoil a community event. On the other hand, perhaps the person has a reason for wanting rain, like maybe the area is facing a drought, and the rain would be beneficial in the long run.\n\nWithout more context, it's hard to judge the morality of the prayer. Generally, though, simply praying for rain without any malicious intent behind it probably isn't considered morally wrong. It's just a personal wish, and wishes are neutral in terms of morality unless they lead to harmful actions.\n\nSo, putting both scenarios together:\n\n- Scenario 1: Paying for SAT prep courses is not morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Praying for rain on the Fourth of July parade is also not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, paying for SAT prep courses is a common practice and is part of preparing for college admissions. It's not cheating or breaking any rules, so it's not morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, praying for rain might be seen as wishing for something that could disrupt a public event, but since it's just a prayer and not an action that directly causes harm, it's not morally wrong.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the correct choice is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
