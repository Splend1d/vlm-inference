Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\n\nA. was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\nB. can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\nC. should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\nD. seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.\n"

                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question about the Cawnpore Massacre during the Indian Revolt of 1857. There are two passages here, and I need to understand what the second one is saying about the massacre. Let me read them both carefully.\n\nThe first passage is from William Howard Russell's \"My Indian Mutiny Diary\" from 1860. He talks about the Cawnpore Massacres and mentions that what made it particularly aggravating was that it was done by Indians against their British masters, including women and children. He also says that it was not just a servile war but involved religion, race, and revenge, and was part of an effort to overthrow British rule and re-establish native authority.\n\nThe second passage is by Rudrangshu Mukherjee from 1990, titled \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857.\" It starts by saying that violence was an essential part of British presence in India and that they had a monopoly on violence, which was shattered during the revolt of 1857. It also talks about the hierarchical arrangement between British and Indians, with the British seeing themselves as superior and Indians as uncivilized.\n\nNow, the question is asking, according to the second passage, what the Cawnpore Massacre was. The options are:\n\nA. Justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\n\nB. Can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n\nC. Should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\n\nD. Seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.\n\nI need to focus on the second passage to see which of these best reflects its viewpoint.\n\nLet me look at the second passage again. It says that violence was essential to British presence in India and that they had a monopoly on violence. The revolt of 1857 challenged this monopoly by matching British violence with indigenous violence. It also mentions that the British in India had certain dignities based on birth and skin color, and that they treated Indians as inferior, almost as animals.\n\nSo, the passage is highlighting the unequal power dynamics and the racial hierarchies established by the British in India. The massacre is seen as part of the revolt that challenged the British monopoly on violence.\n\nLooking at option A, it suggests that the massacre was justifiable according to local military customs, even if it went against Western norms. The second passage doesn't really discuss local military customs or make a case for the justifiability of the massacre based on them. It's more about the challenge to British authority and the violence used in that challenge.\n\nOption B says that the massacre can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force of British governance. This seems plausible because the passage talks about the British monopoly on violence and how the revolt challenged that. So, perhaps the massacre was a reaction to the violence inflicted by the British.\n\nOption C suggests that the massacre should be praised as a patriotic act against colonial oppression. The second passage doesn't explicitly say that it should be praised. It's more analytical, focusing on the dynamics of violence and power rather than passing moral judgment.\n\nOption D proposes that the massacre was the result of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy. The passage doesn't provide any information about the organization or planning behind the massacre. It treats the massacre as part of the revolt without delving into the specifics of how it was planned or organized.\n\nBetween options A, B, and C, option B seems to align best with the second passage's perspective. The passage emphasizes the challenge to British authority and the use of violence as a means to resist their monopoly on force. Therefore, viewing the massacre as a reaction to British brute force fits with the analysis provided in the passage.\n\nI think the answer is B. Can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
