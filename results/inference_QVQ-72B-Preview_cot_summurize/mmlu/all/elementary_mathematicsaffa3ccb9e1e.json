I need to find out how many floors the building has, and there are multiple-choice options: 10, 13, 17, or 9.\n\nAlright, let's think about this step by step. If each story is 14.3 feet tall, and the total height is 185.9 feet, then the number of stories should be the total height divided by the height per story. So, I need to divide 185.9 by 14.3.\n\nLet me try that division. 185.9 divided by 14.3. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on division, but I can try to calculate it.\n\nFirst, I can see that 14 times 13 is 182, which is close to 185.9. So, maybe there are 13 stories. But let's check that more accurately.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use long division. Let's see:\n\n14.3 goes into 185.9. First, I'll consider 14.3 goes into 185 how many times? 14.3 times 12 is 171.6, and 14.3 times 13 is 185.9. Yes, exactly 13 times.\n\nSo, 14.3 times 13 equals 185.9. That means there are 13 stories in the building.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 13 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe there's another way to look at it. Maybe using multiplication to verify.\n\nIf I take 14.3 and multiply it by 13, I get 185.9. That matches the total height of the building. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider using fractions or decimals more precisely, but I think I've got it right with this straightforward approach.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Well, in real life, buildings might have things like basements or partial floors, but the problem seems straightforward, so I'll assume that each full story is exactly 14.3 feet, and the total height is exactly 185.9 feet.\n\nSo, dividing the total height by the height per story gives 13 stories. Therefore, the answer is B. 13.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 13} \\]"
