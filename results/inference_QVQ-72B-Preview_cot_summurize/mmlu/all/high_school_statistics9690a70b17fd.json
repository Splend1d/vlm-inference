                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about contingency tables for chi-square tests of independence. There are four statements, and I need to pick the one that's not true. Let me go through each one carefully.\n\nOption A says that the categories are not numerical for either variable. Hmm, I remember that in a contingency table, we're dealing with categorical variables. So, the categories should be qualitative, like \"yes\" or \"no,\" \"male\" or \"female,\" things like that. They shouldn't be numbers because if they were, we'd probably want to use different types of statistical tests, like t-tests or ANOVA, which deal with numerical data. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption B says that observed frequencies should be whole numbers. Okay, so observed frequencies are just the counts of how many times each combination of categories occurs in the data. For example, if I have a table showing the number of people who smoke and their gender, the observed frequency for \"male smokers\" would be a count like 30 people. Counts can't be fractions; you can't have half a person. So, observed frequencies should indeed be whole numbers. This seems true.\n\nOption C says that expected frequencies should be whole numbers. Now, I'm a bit unsure about this one. Expected frequencies are the frequencies we'd expect to see if there was no association between the two variables, based on the null hypothesis. We calculate these by multiplying the row total and the column total for each cell and dividing by the grand total. But, because of the way we calculate them, expected frequencies don't have to be whole numbers. They can be decimals. For example, if the calculation gives me 4.5, that's fine. It's just the expected count, even if you can't have half a person in reality. So, this statement seems incorrect.\n\nOption D says that expected frequencies in each cell should be at least 5, and to achieve this, sometimes we combine categories for one or both variables. Okay, so I know that for the chi-square test to be valid, most of the expected frequencies should be greater than 5. Some texts say that no more than 20% of the cells should have expected frequencies less than 5. If too many expected frequencies are below 5, the chi-square test might not be accurate, and we might need to combine categories to increase the expected frequencies. For example, if I have categories like \"never,\" \"rarely,\" \"sometimes,\" \"often,\" and \"always,\" and some of these have low expected frequencies, I might combine \"never\" and \"rarely\" into one category called \"infrequent.\" So, this seems correct.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option C is not true because expected frequencies don't have to be whole numbers; they can be decimals.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. I found that observed frequencies should be whole numbers because they're counts, and expected frequencies are calculated and can be decimals. So, yes, option C is incorrect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
