                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, in 1960, there were 450,000 cases of measles reported in the U.S., and by 1996, that number decreased to 500 cases. The question is asking for the number of cases that would have been reported in 1987, assuming the decrease was linear from 1960 to 1996.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for the decrease to be linear over time. If the decrease is linear, that means that the number of cases reduces by a constant amount each year. So, if I can find out how much the number of cases decreases each year on average, I can use that to estimate the number of cases in 1987.\n\nLet me start by figuring out how many years are between 1960 and 1996. Subtracting 1960 from 1996 gives me 36 years. So, there's a 36-year span where the number of cases decreased from 450,000 to 500.\n\nNow, I need to find the average annual decrease in cases. To do that, I can calculate the total decrease in cases and divide it by the number of years.\n\nTotal decrease = final cases - initial cases = 500 - 450,000 = wait, that can't be right. Oh, no, actually, the number of cases decreased from 450,000 to 500, so the total decrease should be 450,000 - 500 = 449,500 cases over 36 years.\n\nSo, the average annual decrease would be the total decrease divided by the number of years:\n\nAverage annual decrease = 449,500 cases / 36 years \u2248 12,486.11 cases per year.\n\nWait, but if I round that, it's approximately 12,486 cases decrease per year.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many years passed from 1960 to 1987. Let's see, 1987 - 1960 = 27 years.\n\nSo, if the decrease is linear, after 27 years from 1960, the number of cases should have decreased by 27 times the average annual decrease.\n\nSo, decrease in 27 years = 27 * 12,486.11 \u2248 337,125 cases.\n\nTherefore, the number of cases in 1987 would be the initial number of cases in 1960 minus the decrease over 27 years.\n\nNumber of cases in 1987 = 450,000 - 337,125 = 112,875.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 112,875 seems to match this answer.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the total decrease from 1960 to 1996 is 450,000 - 500 = 449,500 cases over 36 years. That's correct.\n\nThe average annual decrease is 449,500 / 36 \u2248 12,486.11 cases per year.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1987, that's 27 years, so decrease in that period is 27 * 12,486.11 \u2248 337,125 cases.\n\nSubtracting that from the 1960 cases: 450,000 - 337,125 = 112,875.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the rate of decrease per year and apply it to the number of years from 1960 to 1987.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use the concept of linear equations. If the decrease is linear, the number of cases can be expressed as:\n\nCases = initial cases - (decrease per year) * number of years.\n\nWhich is what I did above.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for a straight line: y = mx + b, where m is the slope (decrease per year), x is the number of years since 1960, and b is the y-intercept (cases in 1960).\n\nGiven two points (0, 450,000) and (36, 500), I can find the equation of the line and then plug in x = 27 to find y.\n\nFirst, find the slope m:\n\nm = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (500 - 450,000)/(36 - 0) = (-449,500)/36 \u2248 -12,486.11, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the equation is:\n\nCases = -12,486.11 * years + 450,000\n\nIn 1987, years = 27, so cases = -12,486.11 * 27 + 450,000 \u2248 112,875\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think this is solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations, and the answer makes sense.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check if there's another way to approach this.\n\nPerhaps using proportions. If the decrease is linear, the ratio of decrease over time should be constant.\n\nSo, the proportion would be:\n\n(decrease from 1960 to 1996) / 36 years = (decrease from 1960 to 1987) / 27 years\n\nSo, 449,500 / 36 = x / 27\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = (449,500 / 36) * 27\n\nFirst, calculate 449,500 / 36:\n\n449,500 \u00f7 36 = 12,486.11 (same as before)\n\nThen, 12,486.11 * 27 = 337,125\n\nAgain, cases in 1987 = 450,000 - 337,125 = 112,875\n\nThis reinforces the previous result.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps using interpolation, since we have two known points and want to find the value at an intermediate point.\n\nLinear interpolation formula:\n\ny = y1 + ((x - x1)(y2 - y1))/(x2 - x1)\n\nWhere:\n\n(x1, y1) = (0, 450,000)\n\n(x2, y2) = (36, 500)\n\nx = 27\n\nSo, y = 450,000 + ((27 - 0)(500 - 450,000))/(36 - 0)\n\ny = 450,000 + ((27)(-449,500))/36\n\ny = 450,000 - (27 * 449,500)/36\n\nFirst, calculate (27 * 449,500) = 12,136,500\n\nThen, 12,136,500 / 36 = 337,125\n\nSo, y = 450,000 - 337,125 = 112,875\n\nSame answer once again.\n\nI think it's clear that the correct answer is 112,875, which corresponds to option D.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check if there's any possibility of misinterpretation in the question.\n\nThe question says \"if the number of cases reported from 1960 to 1996 decreased linearly,\" and asks for the number of cases in 1987.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here; it seems straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 112,875.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
