                    "text": "So Justin had this fear of flying, and he needed to overcome it to take an airplane flight. His therapist helped him with relaxation exercises, and he practiced these exercises in steps: first by looking at pictures of airplanes, then seeing them take off at the airport, then going into an empty plane that wouldn't take off, and finally taking a short flight. I need to figure out which type of therapy this sounds like from the options given: psychoanalysis, behavior therapy, humanistic therapy, or existential therapy.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nFirst, psychoanalysis. I remember that psychoanalysis is a therapeutic approach developed by Sigmund Freud. It focuses on uncovering repressed thoughts and feelings from early childhood that might be causing problems in adulthood. It involves techniques like free association, dream analysis, and transference. From what I can see, Justin's therapy doesn't seem to involve any of these. He's not digging into his past or analyzing dreams. He's learning specific techniques to manage his fear in a step-by-step way. So, maybe psychoanalysis isn't the best fit here.\n\nNext, behavior therapy. I know that behavior therapy is based on the principles of learning theory. It focuses on changing maladaptive behaviors through techniques like systematic desensitization, exposure therapy, and positive reinforcement. The approach is more about modifying behaviors rather than exploring underlying psychological issues. Justin's therapy sounds a lot like systematic desensitization, where he's gradually exposed to the feared object or situation while using relaxation techniques. Starting with looking at pictures, then going to the airport, then getting on a plane that doesn't take off, and finally taking a short flight\u2014that sounds like a graduated exposure to the fear with concurrent use of relaxation exercises to manage anxiety. So, behavior therapy seems like a possible answer.\n\nThen, humanistic therapy. This approach emphasizes personal growth and self-actualization. Therapists like Carl Rogers believed in providing a supportive environment where clients can explore their feelings and develop self-understanding. Techniques might include client-centered therapy, where the therapist reflects and validates the client's emotions. Justin's therapy doesn't seem to focus on personal growth or self-exploration. It's more about learning specific skills to overcome a specific fear. So, humanistic therapy probably isn't the best fit here.\n\nLastly, existential therapy. This type of therapy explores deeper questions about life, death, freedom, and responsibility. It helps clients find meaning in their lives and come to terms with existential anxieties. Techniques might involve discussing life's big questions and helping clients accept uncertainty. Again, Justin's therapy is very practical and focused on overcoming a specific phobia, not on existential questions. So, existential therapy doesn't seem to align with what Justin is going through.\n\nAfter considering all these options, behavior therapy seems to be the most appropriate choice. The step-by-step exposure combined with relaxation exercises is characteristic of behavioral interventions aimed at reducing phobias and anxieties related to specific situations.\n\nJust to make sure, let me recap what I know about behavior therapy and see if it fits Justin's situation.\n\n- Behavior therapy is based on the idea that learned behaviors can be unlearned or modified.\n\n- It uses techniques like exposure therapy, where the person is gradually exposed to the feared object or situation.\n\n- Relaxation exercises are often used in conjunction with exposure to help manage anxiety.\n\n- This combination is known as systematic desensitization, developed by Joseph Wolpe.\n\nLooking back at Justin's therapy, that's exactly what he's doing: systematic desensitization. He's being exposed to increasingly anxiety-provoking situations related to flying while using relaxation exercises to stay calm.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. behavior therapy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
