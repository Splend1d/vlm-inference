                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a manager who received a defamatory letter from his competitor. The competitor called him one of the worst businessmen in town and accused him of professional incompetence. The manager read the letter, put it away, and didn't look at it again. Now, he wants to sue the competitor for defamation based on this letter. I need to figure out whether the court is likely to grant the defendant's motion to dismiss, and if so, on what grounds. The options are based on the common law definition of defamation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what defamation is under common law. Defamation is when someone makes a false statement that damages another person's reputation. It can be either libel (written or published) or slander (spoken). In this case, it's a written letter, so it's libel.\n\nFor defamation to occur, several elements must be present:\n\n1. **Publication**: The statement must be communicated to at least one person other than the plaintiff.\n\n2. **Falsity**: The statement must be false.\n\n3. **Damage to reputation**: The statement must harm the reputation of the plaintiff.\n\n4. **Fault**: The defendant must have fault, usually negligence or malice, in making the statement.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the options:\n\n**Option A**: Yes, it will dismiss on the basis that the publication is made to the manager alone.\n\n- Defamation requires publication to someone other than the plaintiff. If the letter was only sent to the manager and no one else, there might not be publication to a third party. However, in some jurisdictions, showing the letter to oneself can be considered publication if it causes emotional distress or other damages. But traditionally, publication to a third party is required.\n\n**Option B**: Yes, it will dismiss on the basis that the language is not damaging to the manager's reputation.\n\n- The letter calls the manager one of the worst businessmen in town and accuses him of professional incompetence. These statements seem clearly damaging to his professional reputation, especially if he's in business. So, it's hard to argue that the language isn't damaging.\n\n**Option C**: No, it will not dismiss because the circumstances show that all of the elements of defamation are present.\n\n- Let's see: the letter was sent only to the manager, so publication to a third party might be lacking. The statements are false (assuming they are), damaging, and likely made with some level of fault. So, if publication to a third party is required, this might not satisfy that element.\n\n**Option D**: No, it will not dismiss because a plaintiff in a defamatory action has an absolute right to a jury trial to prove defamation.\n\n- While it's true that in many jurisdictions, defamation cases can be tried by a jury, the right to a jury trial doesn't override the need to have a valid cause of action. If the case fails to meet the elements of defamation, the court can dismiss it before it ever gets to a jury.\n\nGiven this, it seems like Option A is the most plausible answer. The letter was only sent to the manager, so there's no publication to a third party, which is a required element of defamation. Without publication, the defamation claim fails.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any possibility that the letter was shown to someone else. The problem says it was addressed to the manager, he read it, put it in a private drawer, and did not read it again. It doesn't mention anyone else seeing it. So, based on the information provided, it appears that only the manager saw the letter.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether the letter could have been seen by someone else inadvertently, like an assistant or a family member, but the problem specifies that it was put in a private drawer, suggesting that it was kept in a place not accessible to others.\n\nAlso, considering that the letter was defamatory, if the manager had shown it to someone else to vent or to seek advice, that would constitute publication to a third party, but again, the problem states that he did not read it again after putting it away.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, it's likely that the court would grant the defendant's motion to dismiss on the grounds that there was no publication to a third party, which is a necessary element of defamation.\n\nSo, the answer is A. Yes, it will dismiss on the basis that the publication is made to the manager alone.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
