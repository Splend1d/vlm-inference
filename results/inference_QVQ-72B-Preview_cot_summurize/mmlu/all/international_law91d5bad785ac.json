                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about the major difference between naturalism and positivism. I'm not entirely sure about all the nuances of these philosophical schools, but I've had some exposure to them in my political science and law classes. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst off, naturalism and positivism are both approaches to understanding law and morality, right? Naturalism, from what I recall, is based on the idea that there are universal principles or rights that exist independently of human laws or statutes. Like, these rights are inherent in human nature or derived from a higher law, maybe divine or something. So, according to naturalists, certain rights are inalienable and apply to all humans everywhere, regardless of what particular laws a government might have enacted.\n\nOn the other hand, positivism seems to take a different stance. Legal positivism, at least, emphasizes that laws are created by states or governing bodies and are based on the will of those in power or the consent of the governed. So, positivists would argue that rights and obligations are defined by the legal systems that states establish. It's more about the formal rules and regulations that a society agrees upon.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. One part says that naturalism is based on a set of rules that are of universal and objective scope, and positivism is based on a structured and coherent legal system created by states based on their interests and desires.\n\nThis seems to align with my understanding. Naturalism looks at universal, objective principles, while positivism looks at the specific laws created by states based on their own interests.\n\nB. While naturalism serves only the theory of human rights law, positivism has a wider and more general scope.\n\nHmm, this suggests that naturalism is solely concerned with human rights, but that doesn't seem quite right. While naturalism does emphasize universal human rights, it's not limited to that. It's more about the idea of universal principles that transcend human-made laws.\n\nC. Naturalism concerns the underpinning values of the international society, while positivism the international rules as such.\n\nThis is interesting. So, naturalism would be about the values that underpin international society, like justice, equality, and so on, whereas positivism is about the actual rules and regulations that make up international law. That makes sense.\n\nD. Naturalism is a school of thought advocated outside of Europe, while positivism is Euro-centric theory.\n\nI'm a bit skeptical about this one. I thought that both naturalism and positivism have had influences across the globe, not just in Europe. Plus, naturalism has a long history in European thought, so saying it's advocated outside of Europe seems off.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C seems to capture the essence of the difference between naturalism and positivism. Naturalism is about the underlying values that give meaning to international society, while positivism is about the concrete, formal rules that constitute international law.\n\nBut let me double-check. Option A also seems plausible because it directly contrasts the universal, objective rules of naturalism with the state-created, interest-based laws of positivism. However, option C provides a similar contrast but phrased in terms of values versus rules.\n\nI think both A and C are capturing similar differences but from slightly different angles. Option A focuses on the scope and basis of the rules, while option C emphasizes the distinction between underlying values and the rules themselves.\n\nPerhaps the key here is to determine which of these options best represents the major difference.\n\nLet me consider this further. Naturalism does emphasize universal, objective principles, which could be seen as underpinning values, whereas positivism focuses on the actual legal constructs created by states. So, option C seems to neatly encapsulate this difference.\n\nOption A, while accurate, might be seen as overlapping with option C. But option C perhaps offers a clearer distinction by specifically mentioning international society and international rules.\n\nAdditionally, option B seems to suggest that naturalism is only about human rights law, which I don't think is accurate. Naturalism has a broader scope beyond just human rights.\n\nOption D appears to be misleading, as both naturalism and positivism have significant presences in European intellectual history.\n\nTherefore, I believe the best answer is C: Naturalism concerns the underpinning values of the international society, while positivism the international rules as such.\n\nThis captures the essence of the difference between the two philosophical approaches in the context of international law and society.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
