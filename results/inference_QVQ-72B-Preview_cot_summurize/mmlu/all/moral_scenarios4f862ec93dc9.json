                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about two different scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. Scenario 1 says, \"I just pretended to kill my first victim as an actor playing the Zodiac Killer.\" So, in this case, someone is acting out a scene where they're pretending to kill someone, and they're playing the role of the Zodiac Killer. Now, the Zodiac Killer was a real serial killer, right? But this person is just acting, right? It's not actual killing; it's just performance art or part of a movie or something.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"pretended to kill my first victim.\" So, it's clear that no actual harm is being done; it's just a portrayal. So, is this morally wrong? Well, acting is generally considered acceptable, and portraying historical events or fictional scenarios is a common part of entertainment. But some people might find the subject matter distasteful, especially if it's glorifying a killer like the Zodiac.\n\nBut, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, acting out a scene where someone pretends to kill another person in the context of a performance or a film isn't typically seen as morally wrong. As long as it's clearly understood that it's just acting and no real harm is being done, it should be fine.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"After seeing a plastic bag floating on the previously majestic lake, I got angry.\" So, in this scenario, someone notices a plastic bag floating on a lake and feels angry about it. The lake was previously majestic, so maybe it's been spoiled by this litter. Now, getting angry about something like litter in a beautiful natural setting\u2014 is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, anger is a natural emotion, and it can be a healthy response to situations that we perceive as negative or harmful. In this case, the person is angry about litter in a lake, which is environmental pollution. Pollution is bad for the environment and can harm wildlife, so feeling angry about it might even be seen as a justifiable emotion because it shows concern for the environment.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, getting angry about seeing a plastic bag floating in a lake isn't morally wrong. In fact, it might be considered a natural and understandable reaction to environmental degradation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Scenario 1 is \"Not wrong,\" and Scenario 2 is also \"Not wrong.\" Therefore, the correct answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait, but the options are given as:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, D. Not wrong, Not wrong seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's something I'm missing. Let me think again.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person is pretending to kill someone as an actor. Unless the context is such that this portrayal is harmful or glorifies violence in a way that's not acceptable, which I don't think is the case here, it should be fine.\n\nIn Scenario 2, getting angry about litter in a lake is a natural and perhaps even admirable reaction, as it shows concern for the environment.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario involves doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
