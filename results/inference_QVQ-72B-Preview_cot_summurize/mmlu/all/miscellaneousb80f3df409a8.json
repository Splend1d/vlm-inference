Hmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that in soccer, most players aren't allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms during play. That's a basic rule, right? The only exception I can think of is the goalkeeper, but let me make sure.\n\nLet me recall the official rules of soccer. I think it's Rule 12 that deals with handball offenses. Oh, wait, actually, it's Rule 12: Fouls and Misconduct. Handball is covered there. It says that a player shall not deliberately touch the ball with their hand or arm, except for the goalkeeper within their own penalty area.\n\nSo, that seems clear. Most players can't use their hands, but the goalkeeper can, but only within their own penalty area. So, does that mean the goalkeeper is the only one allowed to use their hands on the field?\n\nBut wait, the question says \"in the field of play.\" That might include the entire field, not just the penalty area. So, if the goalkeeper steps outside the penalty area, can they still use their hands? I don't think so. I think once they step outside the penalty area, they're subject to the same rules as other players and can't use their hands.\n\nBut let's double-check that. The goalkeeper has special privileges within their own penalty area, primarily the ability to handle the ball. Outside of that area, they're like any other player and can't handle the ball.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then only the goalkeeper is allowed to use their hands, but only within their own penalty area.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. midfielder\n\nB. center\n\nC. sweeper\n\nD. goalkeeper\n\nMidfielders, centers, and sweepers are all outfield players and are not allowed to handle the ball at any time during play, except under unusual circumstances like throw-ins, but even then, it's with the hands, but not during active play.\n\nWait, actually, throw-ins are when a player throws the ball back into play with their hands, but that's not using hands to play the ball during active play.\n\nSo, in active play, only the goalkeeper can use their hands, and only within their own penalty area.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. goalkeeper.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any exception or if maybe another position could also use their hands under certain conditions.\n\nFor example, if a player is preventing an injury or something, but no, that's not a standard rule.\n\nOr maybe if a player accidental touches the ball with their hand, but that's not allowed either.\n\nNo, the only player allowed to use their hands intentionally is the goalkeeper within their penalty area.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is D. goalkeeper.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
