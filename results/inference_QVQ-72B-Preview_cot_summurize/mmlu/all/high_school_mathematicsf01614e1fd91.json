                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"Eighty-five more than the square of a number is the same as the square of the quantity that is 17 less than the number.\" And it wants to know what the number is. The options are 17, 6, 2, or 11.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to translate this word problem into an algebraic equation. Let's see.\n\nLet me call the number \"x.\" So, the square of the number is x squared, which is x\u00b2.\n\nThen, eighty-five more than the square of the number would be x\u00b2 + 85.\n\nNow, the quantity that is 17 less than the number is x - 17.\n\nAnd the square of that quantity is (x - 17)\u00b2.\n\nThe problem says that these two expressions are equal:\n\nx\u00b2 + 85 = (x - 17)\u00b2\n\nOkay, so now I need to solve for x.\n\nFirst, I'll expand the right side:\n\n(x - 17)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 - 34x + 289\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 + 85 = x\u00b2 - 34x + 289\n\nNow, I can subtract x\u00b2 from both sides to simplify:\n\n85 = -34x + 289\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. Now, I'll move the constant terms around.\n\nLet me subtract 289 from both sides:\n\n85 - 289 = -34x\n\nThat's -204 = -34x\n\nNow, divide both sides by -34:\n\nx = -204 / -34\n\nWait, let's calculate that.\n\n204 divided by 34 is 6, because 34 times 6 is 204.\n\nSo, x = 6\n\nBut wait, let's check if this makes sense.\n\nFirst, x\u00b2 + 85 = 6\u00b2 + 85 = 36 + 85 = 121\n\nAnd (x - 17)\u00b2 = (6 - 17)\u00b2 = (-11)\u00b2 = 121\n\nYes, they are equal. So, x = 6 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut the problem gives multiple choices, and one of them is 6. But let me check if the other options work.\n\nLet's try x = 17.\n\nx\u00b2 + 85 = 17\u00b2 + 85 = 289 + 85 = 374\n\n(x - 17)\u00b2 = (17 - 17)\u00b2 = 0\u00b2 = 0\n\nNot equal.\n\nNext, x = 2.\n\nx\u00b2 + 85 = 4 + 85 = 89\n\n(x - 17)\u00b2 = (-15)\u00b2 = 225\n\nNot equal.\n\nLastly, x = 11.\n\nx\u00b2 + 85 = 121 + 85 = 206\n\n(x - 17)\u00b2 = (-6)\u00b2 = 36\n\nNot equal.\n\nSo, indeed, only x = 6 satisfies the equation.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nStarting with:\n\nx\u00b2 + 85 = (x - 17)\u00b2\n\nAlternatively, I could try to solve it by taking square roots.\n\nBut since it's a quadratic equation, and I already solved it algebraically, maybe trying to factor or complete the square isn't necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use substitution or some other method, but it seems unnecessary since the algebraic approach was straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the difference of squares or something, but again, it's probably not needed here.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem.\n\n\"Eighty-five more than the square of a number is the same as the square of the quantity that is 17 less than the number.\"\n\nI think my initial translation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a typo or something, but given the choices, and the equation working out to x=6, I think that's the answer.\n\nSo, the number is 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
