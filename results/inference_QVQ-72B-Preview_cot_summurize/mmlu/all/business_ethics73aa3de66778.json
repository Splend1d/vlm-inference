                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about post-modern ethics. It says that post-modern ethics assert that ethics are context and individual specific, and as such, there's an internal guide to ethics. Then it gives options A through D, which seem to be lists of numbers, probably referring to some statements 1, 2, and 3 that aren't showing here. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand what post-modern ethics are all about. Post-modernism, in general, is a philosophical movement that questions universal truths and emphasizes the role of context and individual perspective. So, applying that to ethics, it would mean that moral values and principles aren't absolute or universal but rather vary based on the situation and the individual's perspective.\n\nThe question states that post-modern ethics assert that ethics are context and individual specific. That seems straightforward. So, according to post-modern thought, what is considered ethical can differ from one context to another and from one person to another.\n\nThen, it says \"as such, there's an internal guide to ethics.\" I think this means that each individual has their own internal moral compass or set of principles that guide their ethical decisions, rather than relying on external authorities or universal moral laws.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 2,3\n\nB. 1,3\n\nC. 1,2,3\n\nD. 1,2\n\nBut wait, I don't see the statements corresponding to 1, 2, and 3. Maybe there's a mistake, and the question was supposed to include those statements. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers refer to something else.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the numbers correspond to principles or characteristics of post-modern ethics, and I need to select which ones are accurate based on the description provided.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Post-modern ethics reject universal moral principles.\n\n2. Post-modern ethics emphasize the importance of individual perspective in moral decision-making.\n\n3. Post-modern ethics recognize that ethical judgments can vary based on cultural and contextual factors.\n\nIf these are the statements, then selecting the ones that align with the initial assertion would make sense.\n\nGiven that, option B is 1,3; option C is 1,2,3; option D is 1,2.\n\nBut since the exact statements aren't provided, I need to make an educated guess based on standard understandings of post-modern ethics.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers refer to different approaches to ethics, and I need to choose which ones are consistent with post-modern ethics.\n\nAnother thought: maybe 1 represents deontological ethics, 2 utilitarianism, and 3 virtue ethics, and I need to pick which of these align with post-modern ethics.\n\nBut that seems unlikely because post-modern ethics don't neatly fit into those traditional categories.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the numbers correspond to different statements in a previous question, and this is part of a series of questions. If that's the case, I might need to refer back to earlier questions to answer this one accurately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is incomplete or missing some context, and I should consider that.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to consider that post-modern ethics emphasize context and individual specificity, and have an internal guide to ethics, meaning that individuals rely on their own moral judgments rather than external rules.\n\nIn that case, the options might be referring to statements that align with this view.\n\nIf I had to guess, I would say that statements 1, 2, and 3 all align with post-modern ethics, making option C (1,2,3) the correct answer.\n\nHowever, without the full context or the actual statements, it's challenging to be entirely sure.\n\nPerhaps I should look for additional clues in the question. The phrase \"as such, there's an internal guide to ethics\" suggests that because ethics are context and individual specific, individuals must look inward for moral guidance rather than relying on external sources.\n\nThis aligns with the post-modern emphasis on individual perspective and subjective experience.\n\nTherefore, if I were to choose, I would select option C, assuming that all three statements align with the described view of post-modern ethics.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider each option:\n\nOption A: 2,3\n\n- This suggests that only statements 2 and 3 are relevant, but without knowing what they are, it's hard to judge.\n\nOption B: 1,3\n\n- Similarly, this combines statements 1 and 3, but again, without knowing their content, it's unclear.\n\nOption C: 1,2,3\n\n- This includes all three statements, implying that all are consistent with post-modern ethics.\n\nOption D: 1,2\n\n- This combines statements 1 and 2, excluding statement 3.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the question likely expects selecting all applicable statements that align with post-modern ethics, option C seems the most comprehensive.\n\nTherefore, my answer would be C. 1,2,3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
