                    "text": "Let's tackle this genetics problem. So, it's about X-linked recessive conditions. I remember that in X-linked recessive inheritance, males are affected more frequently than females because males have only one X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, so they can be carriers if they have one affected X chromosome, but to be affected, they'd need both X chromosomes to carry the mutation.\n\nThe problem gives me the frequency of males affected with this condition, which is 0.10, or one in ten. I need to find the expected frequency of affected females in the population.\n\nFirst, I should recall some basic genetics concepts. For X-linked recessive traits, the frequency of affected males is equal to the frequency of the recessive allele in the population. That's because males only have one X chromosome, so if they have the mutant allele, they express the condition.\n\nSo, if q is the frequency of the recessive allele, then for males, the frequency of affected individuals is q.\n\nGiven that the frequency of affected males is 0.10, that means q = 0.10.\n\nNow, for females to be affected, they need to have two copies of the recessive allele, since it's recessive. So, the frequency of affected females should be q squared, assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again.\n\nIn Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (which would be affected females in this case) is q squared.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, if q is 0.10, then q squared should be 0.10 squared, which is 0.01.\n\nBut let me double-check. The Hardy-Weinberg equation is p squared + 2pq + q squared = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele.\n\nGiven that it's an X-linked recessive condition, the dominant allele would mask the recessive allele in females if they have at least one dominant allele.\n\nSo, females can be:\n\n- Homozygous dominant: p squared\n\n- Heterozygous: 2pq\n\n- Homozygous recessive: q squared\n\nOnly the homozygous recessive females would be affected by the condition.\n\nTherefore, the frequency of affected females should indeed be q squared.\n\nGiven that q = 0.10, then q squared = 0.01.\n\nSo, the expected frequency of affected females is 0.01.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.01\n\nB. 0.001\n\nC. 0.02\n\nD. 0.0001\n\nOption A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other factor that might affect this calculation.\n\nFor example, if the population isn't in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, these calculations might not hold. But the problem doesn't specify any deviations from Hardy-Weinberg, so I can assume it applies.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the X-inactivation in females. In females, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated randomly early in development. However, this process primarily affects the expression of X-linked genes and doesn't directly change the genotype frequencies in the population. So, it shouldn't affect the calculation of the frequency of affected females based on genotype.\n\nMoreover, for the purpose of this problem, and given the options provided, I think it's safe to proceed with the Hardy-Weinberg principle.\n\nTherefore, the expected frequency of affected females is 0.01.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 0.01.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
