The question is saying that if something has a function, then its good depends on... and the options are its function, its substance, our beliefs about it, or cultural practices.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Aristotle said about functions and goodness. I remember that in his ethics and politics, Aristotle talked a lot about teleology, which is the idea that things have purposes or functions that they are supposed to fulfill. He believed that the goodness of something is connected to how well it achieves its purpose.\n\nSo, for example, if you take a knife, its function is to cut things. A good knife is one that cuts well, fulfilling its purpose effectively. Similarly, for living beings, their functions are related to their nature and what they are supposed to do according to their kind.\n\nAristotle applied this thinking to human beings as well. He thought that humans have a particular function that defines what it is to be good as a human. This function is related to our rational nature, since reason is something that sets us apart from other animals.\n\nSo, to answer the question, if something has a function, its good depends on... well, according to Aristotle, it would depend on how well it performs its function. So, option A: its function, seems to align with this.\n\nBut let's look at the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B: its substance. Hmm, substance in Aristotle's philosophy refers to the essence or the being of something. While it's true that the substance of something is related to its function, the direct connection to goodness seems to be more about how well it fulfills its function rather than its substance itself.\n\nOption C: our beliefs about it. This seems more subjective. Aristotle's view is more objective; goodness isn't based on what we believe but on how well something achieves its purpose.\n\nOption D: cultural practices. This is similar to relativism, where what's good is determined by cultural norms. But Aristotle's teleological approach suggests that goodness is inherent in the nature and function of things, not just determined by cultural practices.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I think A. its function is the correct answer according to Aristotle's philosophy.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider another example. Take a seedling. Its function is to grow into a mature plant. A good seedling is one that is healthy and growing properly towards becoming a mature plant. So, again, its goodness is tied to how well it performs its function.\n\nAnother example: a doctor's function is to heal patients. A good doctor is one who is skilled and successful in healing patients. Again, the goodness is tied to the function.\n\nIn all these cases, the goodness seems to depend on the function of the thing or person in question.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that A. its function is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
