                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, there's a man who signed up for a creative writing course at an adult education facility. He agreed to attend weekly classes for six months and pay $500 on the first of each month. He made his first payment and started attending classes. In the second month, he paid again and kept attending. Then, in the third month, he told the director he was having financial troubles and asked for an extension. The director agreed to let him attend while he tried to get the money together. But a week later, he got a letter saying he couldn't attend any more classes unless he paid the next $500.\n\nNow, the question is whether the facility is justified in refusing to let him attend classes because he hasn't paid the third monthly installment.\n\nOption A says no, because by letting him attend without paying the third installment, the facility waived its right to have that installment paid on time.\n\nOption B says no, because allowing him to attend without paying created an implied contract, meaning he can finish the classes without paying in advance.\n\nOption C says yes, because his failure to make the third payment is an anticipatory breach.\n\nOption D says yes, because there was no consideration to get rid of the payment requirement, and this payment is a big part of the contract.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, what's the original contract? He agreed to pay $500 on the first of each month for six months while attending weekly classes.\n\nHe paid the first two months on time and attended the classes. In the third month, he said he was having financial difficulties and asked for an extension. The director agreed to let him attend while he tried to get the money together.\n\nThen, a week later, they sent a letter saying he can't attend unless he pays the next $500.\n\nSo, the issue is whether the facility can enforce the payment requirement after allowing him to attend without paying.\n\nLet's look at option A: the facility waived its right to have the installment paid on time.\n\nIn contract law, waiver means voluntarily giving up a known right. So, did the facility voluntarily give up its right to receive the payment on time by letting him attend without paying?\n\nWell, the director agreed to let him attend while he tried to get the money together, which suggests that they were willing to be flexible about the timing of the payment, at least temporarily.\n\nBut does this agreement to let him attend while he tries to get the money mean they waived their right to eventually receive the payment?\n\nProbably not. Waiver usually requires a clear and definitive intention to\u653e\u5f03the right permanently or for a significant period.\n\nHere, it seems more like a temporary extension of time to pay, not a waiver of the right to payment.\n\nSo, option A might not be the best fit.\n\nOption B: the facility's allowing him to attend without paying created an implied contract, permitting him to complete the classes without advance payment of the installments.\n\nAn implied contract is one that's not explicitly stated but is inferred from the parties' actions or the circumstances.\n\nDid the facility's actions imply that they agreed to let him attend without paying for the rest of the six months?\n\nWell, they only agreed to let him attend while he tried to get the money together for the third month. There's no indication that they agreed to let him skip payments indefinitely.\n\nSo, it's a stretch to say that this created an implied contract for the entire remaining course without payment.\n\nTherefore, option B seems unlikely.\n\nOption C: his failure to make the third payment is an anticipatory breach.\n\nAnticipatory breach occurs when one party indicates, before the time for performance, that they will not perform their contractual obligations.\n\nDid the man indicate that he wouldn't pay the third installment?\n\nHe said he was having financial difficulties and asked for an extension, which suggests he intends to pay eventually but needs more time.\n\nSo, it's not a clear-cut anticipatory breach because he's not saying he won't pay at all; he's just asking for more time to pay.\n\nTherefore, option C might not apply here.\n\nOption D: there was no consideration to extinguish the payment requirement, and this payment is a material part of the contract.\n\nConsideration is what each party gives in exchange for the promises in the contract.\n\nIn this case, the man is giving money, and the facility is providing education services.\n\nNow, the facility agreed to let him attend while he tried to get the money together. Did this agreement to let him attend without immediate payment extinguish his obligation to pay?\n\nProbably not. Allowing him to attend without immediate payment doesn't mean he doesn't have to pay at all.\n\nIt's more like a grace period or an extension of time to pay.\n\nSo, there was no new consideration provided by the man to change the terms of the contract.\n\nTherefore, his obligation to pay the third installment remains.\n\nAnd since payments are a material part of the contract (he's supposed to pay $500 each month), failing to pay could be considered a material breach.\n\nTherefore, the facility is justified in refusing to let him attend classes until he pays the third installment.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- Option A: waiver may not apply because it was a temporary extension, not a permanent\u653e\u5f03of the right to payment.\n\n- Option B: no implied contract for the entire course without payment, as the agreement was only for the third month.\n\n- Option C: not an anticipatory breach because he intends to pay eventually, just needs more time.\n\n- Option D: no consideration was given to change the payment terms, and payment is a material part of the contract, so the facility is justified in refusing attendance until payment is made.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Yes, because there was no consideration to extinguish the payment of the third monthly installment fee, which is a material part of the contract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
