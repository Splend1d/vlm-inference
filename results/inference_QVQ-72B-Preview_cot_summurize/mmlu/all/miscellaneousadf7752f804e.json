Let me just make sure I understand this correctly.\n\nDaylight-saving time, or DST, is when we set our clocks ahead by one hour during the warmer months to make better use of natural daylight. So, in spring, when the days start getting longer, we move our clocks forward so that there's more light in the evening. That means, for example, instead of the sun setting at 7 PM, it would set at 8 PM because of the time change.\n\nI remember that in the United States, DST typically begins in March and ends in November. So, in March, we spring forward by setting our clocks ahead one hour, and in November, we fall back by setting them back one hour.\n\nWait, but the question is specifically about the springtime change. So, in spring, it's one hour forward. Yeah, that sounds right. Let me check if there's any trick here.\n\nIs there any possibility that in some parts of America, they turn the clocks differently? Well, most of the United States observes DST, except for a few places like Arizona and Hawaii, I think. But the question says \"most Americans,\" so generally, it's one hour forward in spring.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll recall the common phrase: \"spring forward, fall back.\" That means in spring, you move the clock forward one hour, and in fall, you move it back one hour. So, the answer should be A. one hour forward.\n\nI don't think it's B. one hour backward, because that's what happens in fall, not spring. And options C and D suggest moving the clock two hours, which isn't standard for DST changes. So, those can be eliminated.\n\nAlright, I'm confident that the correct answer is A. one hour forward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
