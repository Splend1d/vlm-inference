                    "text": "So I've got this case about a patient who had a head injury and fell into a coma. The MRI scan showed an extradural haemorrhage. I need to figure out where this bleeding is happening. The options are:\n\nA. Between the skull bones and dura mater.\n\nB. Between the dura mater and arachnoid.\n\nC. Between the arachnoid and pia mater.\n\nD. Between the pia mater and brain surface.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what an extradural haemorrhage is. \"Extradural\" means outside the dura mater, which is the outermost membrane covering the brain and spinal cord. So, if there's bleeding extradurally, it means blood is collecting between the dura mater and something else.\n\nNow, let's think about the layers covering the brain:\n\n1. Skull bones: These are the hard outer covering of the head.\n\n2. Dura mater: This is the tough, outermost membrane of the meninges, which are the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord.\n\n3. Arachnoid: This is the middle membrane, kind of like a spider web, hence the name.\n\n4. Pia mater: This is the innermost membrane, directly covering the brain tissue.\n\nSo, the layers from outside to inside are: skull \u2192 dura mater \u2192 arachnoid \u2192 pia mater \u2192 brain tissue.\n\nGiven that, extradural means outside the dura mater. So, blood accumulating extradurally would be between the dura mater and the skull bones.\n\nWait, but let's double-check that. The term \"extradural\" literally means outside the dura mater. So, if the dura mater is between the skull and the arachnoid, then outside the dura mater would be towards the skull side, not towards the arachnoid side.\n\nLet me visualize this. If I have the skull, then the dura mater adheres to the inner table of the skull. So, the blood would collect between the dura mater and the skull, which is option A.\n\nOption B is between the dura mater and the arachnoid, which would be intradural, not extradural.\n\nOption C is between the arachnoid and the pia mater, which is the subarachnoid space, where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is located. That's not extradural.\n\nOption D is between the pia mater and the brain surface, which is very close to the brain tissue itself. That would be deeper inside, not outside the dura mater.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems correct: between the skull bones and the dura mater.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should recall that extradural haemorrhages are often associated with fractures of the skull, especially if a middle meningeal artery is torn, leading to bleeding into the space between the dura mater and the skull.\n\nThis type of haemorrhage can compress the brain tissue as blood accumulates in that space, which could explain why the patient fell into a coma.\n\nOn the other hand, subdural haemorrhages occur between the dura mater and the arachnoid membrane, which is option B, and they have a different pathophysiology and presentation.\n\nSo, to reiterate, extradural haemorrhage is between the dura mater and the skull bones, which is option A.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
