There is no hierarchy between the formal sources of international law\n\nB. Treaties supersede custom\n\nC. Custom supersedes treaties\n\nD. General Principles of Law supersede both custom and treaties\n\nHmm, I need to recall what the formal sources of international law are and how they relate to each other.\n\nFirst off, I remember that the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) lists the sources of international law in Article 38. It says that the ICJ shall apply:\n\n1. International conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting states;\n\n2. International custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law;\n\n3. The general principles of law recognized by civilized nations;\n\n4. Judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law.\n\nSo, the primary sources seem to be treaties (conventions) and custom, with general principles being another source, and judicial decisions and academic writings being subsidiary means.\n\nNow, the question is about the hierarchy among these sources. Specifically, whether one source takes precedence over another when there's a conflict between them.\n\nOption A says there's no hierarchy. Is that the case?\n\nI think that in many legal systems, there is a hierarchy where constitutions supersede statutes, and statutes supersede regulations, for example. But in international law, it's a bit different because there isn't a single centralized legal system.\n\nHowever, I recall that there are some principles that govern how these sources interact.\n\nLet me think about the relationship between treaties and custom.\n\nOption B says treaties supersede custom, and option C says custom supersedes treaties.\n\nI need to recall if one of these is correct.\n\nOne key principle in international law is pacta sunt servanda, which means agreements must be kept. This is often referred to as the fundamental principle of treaty law, enshrined in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\n\nBut what happens when a treaty provision conflicts with a customary international law rule?\n\nI think that generally, specific treaty obligations take precedence over general customary rules, but only for the parties to the treaty and in the areas covered by the treaty.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit vague. Is there a general rule about which one supersedes the other?\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose there's a customary international law norm that prohibits certain types of environmental damage, and then a specific treaty is concluded that allows some of that damage under certain conditions. Which one would prevail?\n\nI think that between the parties to the treaty, the treaty would take precedence over the general customary norm, at least in the matters regulated by the treaty.\n\nBut what if some states are not parties to the treaty? Would the customary norm still apply to them?\n\nYes, because customary international law applies to all states unless they have successfully objected to it.\n\nSo, for states not party to the treaty, the customary norm would apply, and for states party to the treaty, the treaty would take precedence in the matters it covers.\n\nDoes that mean that there isn't a general hierarchy between treaties and custom, but rather it depends on the specific circumstances and the content of the treaty and the custom?\n\nThat seems plausible.\n\nMoreover, I recall that some treaties can codify customary international law, making the treaty and the custom effectively the same.\n\nFor example, the Geneva Conventions codify many aspects of customary international humanitarian law.\n\nIn such cases, the treaty and the custom are essentially the same, so neither supersedes the other.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes treaties can modify customary international law, especially for the parties to the treaty.\n\nSo, it seems that the relationship between treaties and custom is nuanced and context-dependent.\n\nWhat about general principles of law?\n\nOption D suggests that general principles of law supersede both custom and treaties.\n\nGeneral principles of law are those principles that are widely recognized and applied in various legal systems, and they form part of international law.\n\nBut do they supersede treaties and custom?\n\nI don't think so. General principles are more foundational and provide the underlying norms and values of international law, but they don't automatically override specific treaty provisions or customary rules.\n\nIn case of a conflict between a general principle and a specific treaty or custom, I think the specific provision would generally prevail, at least for the parties to the treaty or in the context where the custom applies.\n\nSo, this makes me think that option D is incorrect.\n\nGiven all this, it seems that option A is the most accurate: there is no hierarchy between the formal sources of international law.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check.\n\nIs there any authoritative statement or case law that suggests a particular hierarchy?\n\nI recall that the ICJ has sometimes had to balance different sources of international law, but I don't remember any blanket rule that one source always supersedes another.\n\nFor example, in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ had to consider both treaty provisions and customary international law regarding the use of force and intervention.\n\nIn that case, the ICJ found that certain customary norms were reflected in the treaty provisions, and thus they reinforced each other.\n\nBut again, this doesn't establish a general hierarchy.\n\nAnother consideration is the principle of jus cogens, which refers to peremptory norms of international law from which no derogation is permitted.\n\nThese norms are considered to override conflicting treaty provisions and customary rules.\n\nHowever, jus cogens norms are a specific category within international law, and not all treaty provisions or customary rules rise to that level.\n\nTherefore, in cases where there is a conflict between a jus cogens norm and another treaty or custom, the jus cogens norm would prevail.\n\nBut again, this doesn't establish a general hierarchy among the sources of international law.\n\nAdditionally, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties addresses the relationship between treaties and customary international law.\n\nArticle 53 of the Vienna Convention provides that a treaty is void if it conflicts with a peremptory norm of general international law (jus cogens).\n\nArticle 64 states that a treaty may be terminated if there is a fundamental change in circumstances, but this is a separate issue.\n\nMoreover, Article 96 allows for reservations to treaties, which can modify the treaty obligations for the reserving state, but again, this doesn't establish a general hierarchy.\n\nGiven all this, it seems that the correct answer is option A: there is no hierarchy between the formal sources of international law.\n\nInstead, the applicability and precedence of these sources depend on specific circumstances, including the content of the treaties and customs in question, whether the states involved are parties to the treaties, and whether any peremptory norms are engaged.\n\nTherefore, the statement that there is no hierarchy between the formal sources of international law is the most accurate among the given options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
