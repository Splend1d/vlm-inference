                    "text": "So I've got this question here about pricing strategies, and it's asking what it's called when a company deliberately obscures the true cost of an item. The options are predatory pricing, deceptive pricing, price fixing, and skimming. Hmm, let's see which one fits.\n\nFirst off, predatory pricing sounds like when a company sets really low prices to drive competitors out of the market, right? But that doesn't seem to match here because the issue is about obscuring the true cost, not setting low prices to eliminate competition.\n\nDeceptive pricing, that sounds like it involves misleading customers about the actual price they're paying. Maybe through tricky advertising or additional hidden fees. That seems plausible.\n\nPrice fixing is when companies agree to set prices at a certain level, often illegally, to avoid competition. That's not about obscuring the true cost to customers; it's more about collaborating to maintain prices.\n\nSkimming, I think that's when a company sets high prices initially to maximize profits from early adopters before gradually lowering them. Again, that doesn't seem to involve hiding the true cost from customers.\n\nSo, between these options, deceptive pricing seems to be the one that involves deliberately obscuring or misleading customers about the actual cost of an item. Let me double-check that.\n\nI recall that deceptive pricing can take various forms, like advertising a low price but then adding on unexpected fees later in the purchasing process, or using confusing pricing tiers to make comparison difficult. So, yeah, that aligns with the idea of obscuring the true cost.\n\nPredatory pricing is more about setting prices below cost to eliminate competition, not about misleading customers about the price they pay.\n\nPrice fixing is about collaborating with competitors to set prices, which is a different issue.\n\nSkimming is a pricing strategy where a company starts with high prices and lowers them over time, typically seen with new technology products.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Deceptive pricing.\n\nWait a minute, just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any overlap or if another option could also fit.\n\nFor example, could predatory pricing somehow involve obscuring costs? Well, maybe if a company is selling below cost and making up for it with hidden fees, but that seems like a stretch. The primary definition of predatory pricing is about setting low prices to harm competition, not to deceive customers about the actual cost.\n\nPrice fixing is about agreement among competitors on price levels, which doesn't directly relate to obscuring the true cost to consumers.\n\nSkimming is about harvesting maximum profits from early buyers and doesn't involve hiding the true cost.\n\nTherefore, I think deceptive pricing is indeed the most appropriate answer here.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can think of an example. Suppose a company advertises a service for $10 per month but then charges an additional $5 per month for \"administrative fees\" that aren't clearly disclosed upfront. This could be considered deceptive pricing because it obscures the true cost, which is actually $15 per month.\n\nAnother example could be when a product is priced at $19.99 to make it seem cheaper than $20, even though the difference is minimal. This is a mild form of deceptive pricing, using psychological pricing techniques to influence customer perception.\n\nIn both cases, the company is deliberately obscuring or manipulating the perceived cost to influence customer behavior.\n\nSo, to conclude, when a company deliberately obscures the true cost of an item, it's known as deceptive pricing. That would be option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
