                    "text": "So I have this question about the electrolysis of molten magnesium bromide. I need to figure out what's produced at the anode and the cathode. The options are:\n\nA. Magnesium at the anode and bromine at the cathode\n\nB. Magnesium at the cathode and bromine at the anode\n\nC. Magnesium at the cathode and oxygen at the anode\n\nD. Bromine at the anode and hydrogen at the cathode\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what happens during the electrolysis of magnesium bromide. Magnesium bromide is an ionic compound, right? It's made up of magnesium ions (Mg\u00b2\u207a) and bromide ions (Br\u207b). When it's molten, these ions are free to move, which makes it conductive to electric current.\n\nNow, during electrolysis, the anode is the positive electrode, and the cathode is the negative electrode. Ions will move towards the electrode that has the opposite charge. So, positive ions (cations) move to the cathode, and negative ions (anions) move to the anode.\n\nGiven that, in magnesium bromide, Mg\u00b2\u207a are the positive ions and Br\u207b are the negative ions.\n\nAt the cathode, Mg\u00b2\u207a ions should be reduced to magnesium metal. The half-reaction would be:\n\nMg\u00b2\u207a + 2e\u207b \u2192 Mg\n\nSo, magnesium metal should be formed at the cathode.\n\nAt the anode, Br\u207b ions should be oxidized to bromine gas. The half-reaction would be:\n\n2Br\u207b \u2192 Br\u2082 + 2e\u207b\n\nSo, bromine gas should be formed at the anode.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Magnesium at the anode and bromine at the cathode\n\nB. Magnesium at the cathode and bromine at the anode\n\nC. Magnesium at the cathode and oxygen at the anode\n\nD. Bromine at the anode and hydrogen at the cathode\n\nOption B seems to match what I just figured out: magnesium at the cathode and bromine at the anode.\n\nBut let's double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A suggests magnesium is formed at the anode, but that doesn't make sense because anodes are where oxidation occurs, and magnesium is being reduced to metal, which should happen at the cathode.\n\nOption C mentions oxygen at the anode. Hmm, where would oxygen come from in magnesium bromide? Magnesium bromide doesn't contain oxygen, so unless there's some contamination or something, oxygen shouldn't be produced directly from electrolyzing pure magnesium bromide.\n\nOption D says bromine at the anode and hydrogen at the cathode. But in magnesium bromide, there's no hydrogen to be reduced at the cathode. Hydrogen would only be produced if there's water present, which isn't the case here.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option B seems correct: magnesium at the cathode and bromine at the anode.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll think about the standard reduction potentials.\n\nFor magnesium:\n\nMg\u00b2\u207a + 2e\u207b \u2192 Mg E\u00b0 = -2.37 V\n\nFor bromine:\n\nBr\u2082 + 2e\u207b \u2192 2Br\u207b E\u00b0 = 1.06 V\n\nWait, actually, for the anode reaction, since it's oxidation, it's the reverse:\n\n2Br\u207b \u2192 Br\u2082 + 2e\u207b E\u00b0 = -1.06 V\n\nSo, the more negative potential for magnesium suggests that it should be reduced at the cathode, and bromide ions should be oxidized at the anode.\n\nYes, this aligns with option B.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
