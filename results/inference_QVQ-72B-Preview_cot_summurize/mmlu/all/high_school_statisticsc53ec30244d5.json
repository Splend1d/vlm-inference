                    "text": "So I've got this equation here that relates the selling price of a car to its age. The equation is Selling price = 15.9 \u2013 0.983 (age), and it's in thousands of dollars. So, selling price is in $1,000s, right? That means if the selling price is 15.9, that's actually $15,900.\n\nNow, the question is asking what we can conclude from this equation. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: For every year the car gets older, the selling price goes down by approximately 9.83 percent.\n\nHmm, I need to be careful here. The coefficient of age is -0.983, which is in thousands of dollars per year. So, for every additional year, the selling price decreases by $983. But percentage decrease is different from absolute decrease.\n\nLet's calculate the percentage decrease. If I take the derivative of the selling price with respect to age, it's -0.983, which is the marginal decrease in selling price per year. But to find the percentage decrease, I'd need to divide that by the selling price and multiply by 100.\n\nSo, percentage decrease per year would be (-0.983 / selling price) * 100. But the selling price changes with age, so it's not constant. Therefore, saying it decreases by approximately 9.83% per year isn't accurate because the percentage changes depending on the current selling price.\n\nSo, option A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B: A new car costs on the average $9,830.\n\nWait a minute, if age is zero, then selling price = 15.9 \u2013 0.983(0) = 15.9, which is $15,900. So, a new car is supposed to cost $15,900, not $9,830. Maybe the $9,830 is related to the coefficient of age, which is 0.983, but that doesn't make sense here.\n\nOption C: For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $1,590.\n\nWait, the coefficient of age is -0.983, which is in thousands of dollars. So, -0.983 thousand dollars per year means the selling price decreases by $983 per year, not $1,590.\n\nOption D: For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $983.\n\nThis seems to match the coefficient of age. Since the coefficient is -0.983 (in thousands of dollars), that translates to -$983 per year.\n\nSo, option D seems correct.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nThe equation is selling price = 15.9 \u2013 0.983 (age).\n\n- 15.9 is the intercept, which represents the selling price when age is zero, i.e., a new car costs $15,900.\n\n- The slope is -0.983, meaning for each additional year, the selling price decreases by 0.983 thousand dollars, which is $983.\n\nSo, option D is correct.\n\nOption C says the selling price drops by $1,590, which doesn't match the coefficient.\n\nOption B says a new car costs $9,830, but according to the intercept, it's $15,900.\n\nOption A incorrectly interprets the decrease as a percentage.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is option D: For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $983.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
