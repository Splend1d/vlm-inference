                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we're dealing with a normal distribution of salaries for technical writers in a metropolitan region. The mean salary is $55,800, and the first quartile is $48,815. We need to find the standard deviation of this distribution.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a normal distribution is and what the first quartile represents in this context. A normal distribution is symmetric around the mean, and it's characterized by its mean (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3). The first quartile, also known as Q1, is the point where 25% of the data lies below it.\n\nSince the distribution is normal, I know that certain percentages of the data fall within specific standard deviations from the mean. For example, about 68% of the data is within one standard deviation, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations. But here, we're dealing with quartiles, so I need a different approach.\n\nI remember that in a normal distribution, the first quartile can be found using the inverse normal cumulative distribution function. Specifically, Q1 corresponds to the 25th percentile, which means that 25% of the data is below this value.\n\nSo, if I denote the salary as a random variable X, which follows a normal distribution with mean \u03bc = $55,800 and standard deviation \u03c3 (which we need to find), then:\n\nX ~ N(\u03bc, \u03c3\u00b2)\n\nAnd Q1 is given by:\n\nP(X < Q1) = 0.25\n\nIn terms of the standard normal distribution, this can be expressed as:\n\nP((X - \u03bc)/\u03c3 < (Q1 - \u03bc)/\u03c3) = 0.25\n\nLet Z = (X - \u03bc)/\u03c3, which follows a standard normal distribution N(0,1). So,\n\nP(Z < (Q1 - \u03bc)/\u03c3) = 0.25\n\nI can look up the value of Z that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.25 in a standard normal table. I think the Z-score for the first quartile is approximately -0.674. So,\n\n-0.674 = (Q1 - \u03bc)/\u03c3\n\nNow, I can plug in the known values:\n\n-0.674 = (48,815 - 55,800)/\u03c3\n\nLet me calculate the numerator:\n\n48,815 - 55,800 = -6,985\n\nSo,\n\n-0.674 = -6,985 / \u03c3\n\nNow, I can solve for \u03c3 by multiplying both sides by \u03c3 and then dividing by -0.674:\n\n-6,985 = -0.674 * \u03c3\n\nDividing both sides by -0.674:\n\n\u03c3 = 6,985 / 0.674 \u2248 10,363.36\n\nRounding to the nearest dollar, the standard deviation is approximately $10,363.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $6,984\n\nB. $10,356\n\nC. $10,476\n\nD. $13,968\n\nOption B is $10,356, which is very close to my calculation of $10,363.36. So, I would say the answer is B. $10,356.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I should verify the Z-score I used. I recalled that the Z-score for the first quartile is approximately -0.674. Let me confirm that.\n\nIn a standard normal distribution, the Z-score that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.25 is indeed approximately -0.674. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I had used a different Z-score, say -0.67, the calculation would be:\n\n-0.67 = (48,815 - 55,800)/\u03c3\n\n-0.67 = -6,985 / \u03c3\n\n\u03c3 = 6,985 / 0.67 \u2248 10,425\n\nThis would round to $10,425, which is closer to option C. $10,476. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the exact Z-score for the first quartile is -0.67449, which would give a more precise standard deviation.\n\nLet me try using a more precise Z-score. If I use -0.6745, then:\n\n-0.6745 = -6,985 / \u03c3\n\n\u03c3 = 6,985 / 0.6745 \u2248 10,356.55\n\nThat matches option B. $10,356 exactly.\n\nSo, the precise standard deviation is $10,356.55, which rounds to $10,356. Therefore, the correct answer is B. $10,356.\n\nI must have made a slight miscalculation earlier when I used -0.674, but using -0.6745 gives the exact value of $10,356.55, which aligns with option B.\n\nThus, the standard deviation of the salary distribution is $10,356.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 10,356} \\]"
