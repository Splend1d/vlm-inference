                    "text": "Alright, I'm trying to understand this debate about the state's right to exclude people. So, there's this \"egalitarian\" objection to the idea that states have an absolute right to decide who comes in and who doesn't. And Wellman is defending the state's right to exclude, but Fine is critiquing Wellman's response. It's a bit confusing, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, what's the egalitarian objection? I think egalitarians believe in equality among people, right? So, they might argue that all people, regardless of where they were born, have equal claims to opportunities and resources. Therefore, they might object to states excluding people based on arbitrary criteria like nationality.\n\nWellman, on the other hand, seems to be arguing that states can fulfill their duties to outsiders without necessarily letting them in. So, maybe he's suggesting that states can help people in other ways, like providing aid or supporting human rights, without opening their borders.\n\nBut Fine thinks Wellman's response is insufficient. Now, I need to figure out why. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Egalitarians are committed to utilitarian principles.\n\nWell, utilitarianism is about maximizing happiness or utility for the greatest number. Egalitarians might or might not be utilitarians. Some egalitarians might prioritize equality for its own sake, not just because it leads to greater utility. So, maybe Fine is pointing out that equating egalitarianism with utilitarianism is too simplistic.\n\nB. Wellman himself is an immigrant.\n\nHmm, that seems irrelevant. Whether Wellman is an immigrant or not shouldn't affect the validity of his argument. Personal background doesn't determine the logical soundness of a position. So, I doubt this is the reason Fine finds his response insufficient.\n\nC. Excluding people who wish to pursue interests specific to that state is still potentially harmful.\n\nThis seems plausible. If a state excludes someone who wants to pursue certain interests there, like family reunification, education, or employment, that could harm the excluded person's ability to fulfill those interests. So, even if the state helps outsiders in other ways, denying them the opportunity to enter and pursue their goals might still cause significant harm.\n\nD. The concept of \"exporting justice\" is internally contradictory.\n\nThis sounds interesting. Maybe Wellman is suggesting that states can \"export\" justice by, say, supporting international institutions or providing foreign aid. But Fine might be arguing that justice is something that can't be exported because it requires direct action within a state's borders. Like, you can't have justice unless it's applied to the people under your jurisdiction. So, the idea of exporting justice might be contradictory because justice is inherently about how you treat those within your society, not just helping people from afar.\n\nBetween options C and D, I'm a bit torn. Option C points to specific harms that exclusion can cause to individuals, while option D challenges the coherence of Wellman's proposed solution.\n\nMaybe I need to think about which one is more fundamental. If Wellman's idea is that states can fulfill their duties to outsiders without letting them in, and Fine is saying that the very concept of \"exporting justice\" doesn't make sense, that seems like a pretty strong critique. It questions the foundation of Wellman's argument.\n\nOn the other hand, pointing out that excluding people can still cause harm is also a significant issue. It suggests that even if a state helps outsiders in other ways, the act of exclusion itself is problematic because it infringes on people's abilities to pursue their lives as they see fit.\n\nPerhaps Fine's critique combines elements of both. But if I have to choose one, I'd lean towards D, because if the concept of \"exporting justice\" is internally contradictory, then Wellman's entire response falls apart. If the means he proposes to fulfill duties to outsiders is incoherent, then his argument is insufficient.\n\nWait, but option C is also important. Even if Wellman could somehow \"export justice,\" the act of exclusion still causes specific harms to individuals who want to enter the state for various reasons.\n\nMaybe Fine's critique includes both points, but again, if I have to pick one, I'd go with D, because it challenges the core of Wellman's proposal.\n\nLet me see if there's any other information that could help me decide.\n\nLooking back, the question says that Wellman's response is that states can fulfill their duties to outsiders without allowing them into their territory. So, he's suggesting alternative ways to meet those duties.\n\nFine thinks this response is insufficient. Why?\n\nOption A suggests that egalitarians are committed to utilitarian principles. But I'm not sure how that directly relates to Wellman's response or Fine's critique. It seems like a bit of a stretch.\n\nOption B is about Wellman's personal background, which, as I thought earlier, shouldn't affect the validity of his argument. So, I can probably eliminate that.\n\nOption C highlights that excluding people can still cause harm, which is a problem for Wellman's position.\n\nOption D questions the coherence of the concept of \"exporting justice,\" which is central to Wellman's proposal.\n\nBetween C and D, D seems more directly aimed at the feasibility of Wellman's alternative, while C points out a consequence of exclusion that Wellman's alternative doesn't address.\n\nI think D is the stronger critique because if the concept of \"exporting justice\" is internally contradictory, then Wellman's whole alternative collapses. Whereas pointing out that exclusion causes harm is important, but perhaps Wellman could argue that those harms are necessary for the state to function or protect its own citizens.\n\nTherefore, I believe the answer is D: the concept of \"exporting justice\" is internally contradictory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
