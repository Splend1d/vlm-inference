                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario about a videographer and a man who hired him to film his daughter's wedding. They had a written contract that says the videographer would be paid $10,000 for filming and editing a 60-minute video of the wedding and reception. Additionally, there was a stipulation that the video would be filmed using high definition equipment. But the contract didn't say anything else about compensation.\n\nAfter the videographer did the job and presented the video, he sent an invoice for $15,000. This included the $10,000 contract fee plus an extra $5,000 for using high definition equipment. The man only paid $10,000, denying any additional liability. Now, the videographer is suing to get the extra $5,000.\n\nI need to figure out which argument would be most persuasive to support the videographer's claim that the man agreed to pay $5,000 extra for the high definition equipment.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. According to the customary trade practice of the video industry, a $10,000 fee for filming and editing means $10,000 in addition to a supplemental charge if high definition equipment is used.\n\nThis seems relevant because it suggests that in the video industry, it's standard to charge extra for high definition equipment. So, if this is a common practice, maybe the man should have known that there would be an additional charge for using high definition equipment.\n\nB. An oral agreement to that effect, if provable, would only supplement, not contradict, the \"payment clause\" as written.\n\nThis is about oral agreements supplementing the written contract. If there was an oral agreement for the extra charge, and it can be proven, and it doesn't contradict the written contract, then it might be admissible. But the contract already specifies the payment clause, so I need to see if this oral agreement is allowed to add to that.\n\nC. Under the UCC, extrinsic evidence, if available, of additional terms agreed to by the parties is admissible unless such terms \"would certainly vary or contradict those contained in the document.\"\n\nThe UCC is the Uniform Commercial Code, which deals with sales and contracts for goods. Since this involves a service (videography), I'm not sure if the UCC applies here. Maybe it does if the videography involves some goods, but I think primarily it's a service contract. So, I'm a bit unsure about this one.\n\nD. Assuming arguendo that the written \"payment clause\" was fully integrated and neither patently nor latently ambiguous, equitable considerations require admission of extrinsic evidence, if available, of the parties' intent, since the videographer would stand to lose $5,000 on the contract.\n\nThis seems to suggest that even if the contract is clear and unambiguous, equity (fairness) should allow for extrinsic evidence to show what the parties intended, especially since the videographer would lose money otherwise.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about which of these arguments is the most persuasive.\n\nFirst, option A relies on industry custom. If it's standard practice in the video industry to charge extra for high definition equipment, then perhaps the man should have known that and expected an additional charge. However, contracts are typically based on what's explicitly agreed upon between the parties, not just on industry customs unless explicitly incorporated into the contract.\n\nOption B talks about oral agreements supplementing the written contract. Generally, in contract law, oral agreements can be enforceable, but they need to be proven, and they can't contradict the written terms. In this case, the written contract specifies a $10,000 fee, so an oral agreement for an additional $5,000 would contradict that unless it's seen as supplementing it.\n\nOption C mentions the UCC, but I'm not sure if the UCC applies here because this seems more like a service contract than a sale of goods. Maybe it's not directly applicable.\n\nOption D talks about equity and allowing extrinsic evidence even if the contract is fully integrated and unambiguous. This seems interesting because it suggests that fairness should prevail, and the videographer shouldn't lose $5,000 if there was an understanding for additional payment.\n\nBut wait, parol evidence (oral or written evidence outside the written contract) is generally not admissible to contradict the written terms of a contract. So, if the contract clearly states that the payment is $10,000 for filming and editing with high definition equipment, then trying to add an extra $5,000 through oral agreement might be seen as contradicting the written contract.\n\nHowever, perhaps the contract doesn't explicitly include all terms, and there's room for supplementary terms that don't contradict the written ones.\n\nLet me think about this differently. The contract says the videographer will be paid $10,000 for filming and editing a 60-minute video using high definition equipment. It doesn't specify that this is the only compensation or that no additional charges apply.\n\nThe videographer is claiming that using high definition equipment comes with an extra charge of $5,000. If this was a standard practice in the industry (as per option A), then perhaps the man should have known about it.\n\nAlternatively, if there was an oral agreement for the extra charge, and it can be proven, then that might be enforceable.\n\nBut the key here is that the written contract doesn't mention any additional charges for high definition equipment. So, if the videographer wants to argue for the extra $5,000, he needs to show that there was an agreement for that amount beyond the written contract.\n\nOption D suggests that even if the contract is fully integrated, equity might allow for extrinsic evidence to show the parties' intentions. However, in contract law, fully integrated contracts are generally considered to contain all the terms of the agreement, and extrinsic evidence is not admissible to add terms that contradict the written agreement.\n\nBut maybe in this case, the court would consider equity, especially if the videographer incurred extra costs for using high definition equipment and relied on the extra payment.\n\nWait, but the contract didn't specify that high definition equipment would cost extra. It just said that the video would be filmed using high definition equipment, and the payment was $10,000.\n\nSo, did the man agree to pay $10,000 for the service, including the use of high definition equipment, or did he agree to pay $10,000 plus an extra $5,000 for the equipment?\n\nThis seems like a classic case of ambiguous terms or incomplete specification of compensation.\n\nOption A, the industry custom, might be relevant if it's a widely recognized practice that high definition equipment comes with an extra charge. If that's the case, then perhaps the man should have anticipated the extra charge.\n\nOption B, the oral agreement, could be relevant if there was a clear understanding and agreement for the extra $5,000, and it can be proven.\n\nOption C, the UCC, might not be directly applicable here since this is a service contract.\n\nOption D suggests that equity should allow for extrinsic evidence even if the contract is fully integrated, but that might not be in line with standard contract law principles.\n\nI think the strongest argument is option A, because if it's a standard industry practice to charge extra for high definition equipment, then the man should have known about it and should have inquired about any additional costs before agreeing to the contract.\n\nAlternatively, option B could be strong if there's clear evidence of an oral agreement for the extra $5,000, but that might be harder to prove.\n\nOption C is questionable because I don't think the UCC applies directly to service contracts.\n\nOption D is interesting but might not hold up legally because courts generally respect the terms of fully integrated contracts.\n\nSo, I think the most persuasive argument is option A, relying on industry custom to support the additional charge for high definition equipment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
