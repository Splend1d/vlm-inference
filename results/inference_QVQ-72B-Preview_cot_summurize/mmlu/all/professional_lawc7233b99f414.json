                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out whether the court will consider outside evidence about what the parties intended in their deed. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a landowner who sold a piece of land to a buyer. But the deed had a clause that said, \"Less and excepting a strip of land forty feet wide along the east side of Winter Street, all the way across said land, for use in the future if and when a road is needed for travel.\" So, basically, the landowner is keeping this forty-foot strip for potential road use in the future.\n\nAdditionally, during negotiations, they signed a side agreement saying that the landowner would retain an absolute right to travel over that strip for certain purposes. But later, the buyer stopped the landowner from using the strip for travel, even though no road had been constructed yet.\n\nNow, the landowner is suing the buyer, claiming that they still own the forty-foot strip because it wasn't clearly conveyed in the deed and might be ambiguous.\n\nThe question is whether the court will consider outside evidence, like the side agreement, to understand what the parties intended regarding the right-of-way over the buyer's land.\n\nOkay, so I need to recall some legal principles here. There's something called the \"four corners\" rule, which I think means that when interpreting a contract or a deed, the court should look only at the document itself and not at outside evidence unless there's ambiguity in the wording.\n\nOption A says, \"No, the court will confine itself to what is in the four corners of the deed.\" That sounds like the four corners rule.\n\nOption B says, \"No, because that would violate the parole evidence rule.\" Hmm, I need to remember what the parole evidence rule is. I think it's about not allowing oral agreements to contradict a written contract. But in this case, it's a side agreement that was signed, so it's also a written document. Maybe the parole evidence rule doesn't apply here because the side agreement is written and related to the deed.\n\nOption C says, \"Yes, because the court always has a right to reform the wording of a deed according to the court's interpretation of what it means.\" That seems a bit strong. Does the court always have the right to reform the deed based on their interpretation? I'm not sure about that. Maybe in certain circumstances, but not always.\n\nOption D says, \"Yes, because an ambiguously-worded easement or right-of-way can be supplemented by outside information to get at the true intention of the parties.\" This seems relevant. If the deed is ambiguous about whether the landowner retains a right to travel over the strip or if it's just for future road use, then maybe the court can look at the side agreement to understand the parties' intentions.\n\nWait, but the side agreement says the landowner retains an \"absolute right to travel over that strip of land for certain purposes.\" So, regardless of whether a road is built or not, the landowner has some rights to use the strip for travel.\n\nBut the buyer is stopping the landowner from using it for travel, perhaps arguing that the strip is only for future road construction, not for current travel purposes.\n\nSo, the landowner is saying that the deed is ambiguous about the strip and that the side agreement should be considered to clarify their rights.\n\nBut deeds are typically interpreted based on their written terms. If the deed clearly states that the strip is being excepted for future road use, does that automatically imply that the landowner cannot use it for travel until a road is built?\n\nWait, maybe not. Maybe the landowner can use it for travel even before a road is built, based on the side agreement.\n\nBut in legal terms, how does that work? Is the side agreement binding? Was it properly incorporated into the deed?\n\nI think I need to consider whether the side agreement is enforceable and whether it can be used to interpret the deed.\n\nI recall that parol evidence, which is oral or written evidence outside the written contract, can be admissible to explain ambiguous terms in the contract. So, if the deed is ambiguous about the rights regarding the strip, then the side agreement could be used to clarify the intentions of the parties.\n\nBut first, is the deed ambiguous? The clause says, \"Less and excepting a strip of land forty feet wide along the east side of Winter Street, all the way across said land, for use in the future if and when a road is needed for travel.\"\n\nIs this clause ambiguous? It seems to suggest that the strip is being retained for future road use, but it doesn't explicitly say that the landowner cannot use it for travel before a road is built.\n\nMoreover, the side agreement says the landowner retains an absolute right to travel over the strip for certain purposes. So, there's a conflict here between the deed and the side agreement.\n\nWait, but both documents were signed by the parties, so perhaps they intended to have both agreements coexist.\n\nIn such cases, courts might look at all relevant written agreements between the parties to understand their intentions.\n\nSo, perhaps the court would consider the side agreement as part of the overall agreement between the landowner and the buyer.\n\nBut, generally, deeds are supposed to be clear and unambiguous, and external evidence is not admitted to contradict their terms.\n\nHowever, if there's ambiguity in the deed, then external evidence can be used to clarify the ambiguity.\n\nIn this case, the deed says the strip is for future road use if needed, but it doesn't specify whether the landowner can use it for travel before a road is built.\n\nThe side agreement seems to grant the landowner the right to travel over the strip for certain purposes, which suggests that even without a road being built, the landowner has some rights to use the strip.\n\nSo, perhaps the court would consider the side agreement to interpret the deed's clause about the strip.\n\nOption D seems to align with this reasoning: \"Yes, because an ambiguously-worded easement or right-of-way can be supplemented by outside information to get at the true intention of the parties.\"\n\nOption A says no, the court will only look at the deed itself, which might be the case if the deed is unambiguous.\n\nBut in this scenario, since there's a potential ambiguity about the rights over the strip, especially considering the side agreement, I think the court would consider the outside evidence.\n\nOption B says no, because it would violate the parole evidence rule. But since the side agreement is written, not oral, and related to the deed, I'm not sure if the parole evidence rule would prevent its consideration.\n\nOption C says yes, the court can always reform the deed according to their interpretation. That seems too broad. Courts don't just rewrite deeds; they interpret them based on the parties' intentions.\n\nSo, between options A, B, C, and D, I think D is the most accurate.\n\nYes, because the deed's clause about the strip is ambiguous regarding the landowner's rights to travel over it before a road is built, the court can consider the side agreement to understand the parties' true intentions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
