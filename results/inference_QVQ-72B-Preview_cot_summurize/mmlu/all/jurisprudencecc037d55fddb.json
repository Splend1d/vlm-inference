                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about Austin's theory of law. The options are all similar, but I need to pick the most accurate one. Let me recall what I learned about Austin's definition of law.\n\nAustin is known for his command theory of law, right? He thought that law is essentially a command from a sovereign to its subjects, and there's some backing it up, like sanctions or enforcement mechanisms. So, the key components are command, sovereign, and something related to enforcement or sanctions.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Command, sovereign and enforceability\n\nB. Command, sovereign and legal remedy\n\nC. Command, sovereign and sanction\n\nD. Command, sovereign and obedience by subject\n\nI remember that Austin emphasized that laws are commands backed by threats of punishment or sanctions. So, enforceability seems relevant because if a law isn't enforceable, it's not really a law according to Austin. But maybe sanctions are more specific.\n\nLet me think about sanctions. In legal terms, a sanction is a penalty or consequence for violating a law. So, it's a specific type of enforcement. Maybe sanction is more precise than enforceability.\n\nOption C says command, sovereign, and sanction. That sounds plausible.\n\nOption A says command, sovereign, and enforceability. Enforceability is broad; it includes the idea that laws can be enforced, but it doesn't specify how, like through sanctions.\n\nOption B mentions legal remedy. A legal remedy is something like compensation or an injunction provided by a court. But Austin's theory is more about positive law and punishment, so maybe remedy isn't the best fit.\n\nOption D includes obedience by subject. While it's true that laws are meant to be obeyed, Austin's theory focuses more on the command and the backing of sanctions, not necessarily on whether people obey. Obedience is more about compliance, which is separate from the nature of the law itself.\n\nSo, between options A, C, and maybe B, I need to decide.\n\nWait, let me look up Austin's exact definition to confirm.\n\nOkay, John Austin defined law as \"the command, proceeding from sovereign authority, enforced by sanctions.\"\n\nSo, command, sovereign, and sanctions.\n\nTherefore, option C matches this definition perfectly.\n\nOption A mentions enforceability, which is related but not as precise as sanctions.\n\nOption B has legal remedy, which isn't central to Austin's command theory.\n\nOption D has obedience by subject, which isn't part of the definition of law itself.\n\nSo, the most accurate response is C: command, sovereign, and sanction.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
