                    "text": "Let's see. Terri opened a fast food restaurant, and there are some costs involved. The initial cost to open the restaurant is $800,000. That's a big number! Then, there are daily operational costs of $250 and labor costs of $400. So, these recurring costs happen every day the restaurant is open. The question is asking for the total cost based on the number of days the restaurant has been open, which is represented by \"D\" days.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what total cost includes. It should be the initial cost plus the total of all the daily costs multiplied by the number of days, right?\n\nSo, initial cost is $800,000.\n\nDaily costs are operational costs plus labor costs. That's $250 plus $400. Let me calculate that: $250 + $400 = $650.\n\nNow, for \"D\" days, the total daily costs would be $650 multiplied by D. So, $650D.\n\nTherefore, the total cost should be initial cost plus total daily costs: $800,000 + $650D.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 800,000 + 150 D\n\nB. 800,000 + 650 D\n\nC. 800,000 \u2212 650 D\n\nD. 650 + 800,000 D\n\nHmm, option B seems to match my calculation: 800,000 + 650 D.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe I should consider if there are any other costs or if there's something I'm missing.\n\nThe initial cost is a one-time expense, right? That's the $800,000 to open the restaurant. Then, every day the restaurant is open, she has to pay $250 for operations and $400 for labor, totaling $650 per day.\n\nSo, for D days, it should indeed be $800,000 + $650D.\n\nOption C is $800,000 minus 650D, which doesn't make sense because costs are additive, not subtractive.\n\nOption D is 650 + 800,000D, which seems like daily cost plus initial cost per day or something, but that doesn't align with the structure of the problem.\n\nOption A is $800,000 + 150D. Wait, where does 150 come from? That's $250 + $400 minus $500 or something? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nProbably, option B is the correct one.\n\nLet me see if there's any trick here. Is the initial cost a one-time cost, or does it repeat? No, it's specified as the initial cost to open the restaurant, so it's a one-time expense.\n\nDaily operational and labor costs are per day, so they accumulate with each day the restaurant is open.\n\nTherefore, total cost = initial cost + (daily costs) * D.\n\nWhich is $800,000 + $650D.\n\nYes, option B is correct.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
