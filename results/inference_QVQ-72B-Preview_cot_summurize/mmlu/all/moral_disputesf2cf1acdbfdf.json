                    "text": "So I've got this question here about externalities imposed on the world's poor by the economic activities of wealthy nations. The options are unequal social order, authoritarian regimes, crime, and pollution. I need to pick the one that fits the description. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, what's an externality? From my economics class, I remember that an externality is a cost or benefit that affects a third party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit. So, in this context, it's about the negative impacts that wealthy nations' economic activities have on poor countries without those poor countries getting a say in it.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Unequal social order: Hmm, this seems a bit vague. An unequal social order could be a result of many things, not necessarily directly tied to wealthy nations' economic activities. Also, it's not immediately clear if this is an externality in the economic sense.\n\nB. Authoritarian regimes: Again, while some might argue that wealthy nations support authoritarian regimes for economic gain, this seems more like a political influence rather than a direct externality of economic activity.\n\nC. Crime: This seems out of place. Crime is generally a domestic issue within countries and not directly linked to externalities from wealthy nations' economic activities.\n\nD. Pollution: Now, this rings a bell. Pollution is often discussed in the context of externalities because it's a cost borne by society that isn't accounted for in the production process. Wealthy nations have industries that emit pollutants, which can affect global climate and environmental conditions, thereby impacting poor countries.\n\nLet me dig deeper into pollution as an externality. When factories in wealthy nations emit greenhouse gases, for example, these gases contribute to global warming, which in turn can lead to more frequent and severe natural disasters, rising sea levels, and changes in weather patterns. These effects can severely impact poor countries that are less equipped to handle such challenges. Moreover, these countries often rely on agriculture and fishing, which are highly sensitive to environmental changes.\n\nAnother aspect is transboundary pollution, where pollutants like acid rain or airborne particles from one country affect the air quality and ecosystems of neighboring countries, including those that might be poorer and less able to mitigate these effects.\n\nAlso, considering the concept of \"pollution havens,\" where companies from wealthy nations might move their polluting industries to poorer countries with weaker environmental regulations, thereby exploiting their lower costs while imposing health and environmental costs on the local population.\n\nSo, pollution seems to be a clear example of an externality imposed on poor countries by the economic activities of wealthy nations.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the other options could also be considered externalities in this context.\n\nUnequal social order: While social inequality is a significant issue, it's not directly an externality of economic activity in the same way pollution is. Social inequality can be influenced by various factors, including global economic systems, but it's not a direct byproduct of specific economic activities like industrial production or resource extraction.\n\nAuthoritarian regimes: Supporting or propping up authoritarian regimes might be seen as having negative externalities, such as human rights abuses or lack of democratic participation, but again, this is more of a political issue rather than a direct externality of economic activity.\n\nCrime: This seems unrelated to the concept of externalities from economic activities of wealthy nations. Crime is typically a domestic issue influenced by a complex set of factors, including poverty, inequality, and governance, but it's not directly imposed by external economic activities.\n\nTherefore, after considering all the options, I'm confident that pollution is the correct answer. It's a direct externality of economic activities in wealthy nations that negatively impacts poor countries around the world.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. pollution}} \\]"
