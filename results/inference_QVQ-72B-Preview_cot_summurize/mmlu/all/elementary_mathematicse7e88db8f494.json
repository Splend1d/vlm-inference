                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to find which fraction is greater than 2 over 5. The options are 1 over 5, 1 over 10, 4 over 10, and 5 over 10. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on fractions, but I'll try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to compare these fractions to 2/5 and see which one is bigger. I remember that fractions have a numerator and a denominator. The numerator is the top number, and the denominator is the bottom number. So, in 2/5, 2 is the numerator, and 5 is the denominator.\n\nOption A is 1 over 5. That means the numerator is 1, and the denominator is 5. So, 1/5 is smaller than 2/5 because 1 is less than 2. So, this can't be the answer.\n\nOption B is 1 over 10. That's 1/10. Comparing 1/10 to 2/5, I need to see which is bigger. I think 1/10 is smaller than 2/5. Let me confirm that. If I have 1/10 and 2/5, I can make the denominators the same to compare them easily. The denominator of 10 is bigger than 5, so maybe I can find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 10 is 10. So, I'll convert both fractions to have a denominator of 10.\n\nFor 2/5, to get the denominator to 10, I multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2. So, 2/5 becomes 4/10. Now, comparing 1/10 and 4/10, it's clear that 1/10 is less than 4/10. Therefore, 1/10 is less than 2/5.\n\nOption C is 4 over 10, which is 4/10. From the previous step, I already converted 2/5 to 4/10, so 2/5 is equal to 4/10. Wait, but the question is asking for fractions greater than 2/5, not equal to it. So, 4/10 is equal to 2/5, not greater.\n\nOption D is 5 over 10, which is 5/10. I need to compare this to 2/5. Again, I'll convert both to have the same denominator for easier comparison.\n\nI already know that 2/5 is equal to 4/10. So, now I need to compare 4/10 and 5/10. Since both have the same denominator, I can just look at the numerators. 5 is greater than 4, so 5/10 is greater than 4/10, which means 5/10 is greater than 2/5.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe I can cross-multiply to confirm. To compare 2/5 and 5/10, I can cross-multiply: 2 times 10 is 20, and 5 times 5 is 25. Since 20 is less than 25, 2/5 is less than 5/10. So, yes, 5/10 is greater than 2/5.\n\nLet me just double-check if there's any other fraction here that might be greater than 2/5. Looking back at the options:\n\nA. 1/5\n\nB. 1/10\n\nC. 4/10\n\nD. 5/10\n\nI already determined that A, B, and C are less than or equal to 2/5, and D is greater. So, the answer should be D. 5/10.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about decimal equivalents. Let's convert each fraction to a decimal.\n\n2/5 is equal to 0.4. Now, let's convert the options:\n\nA. 1/5 = 0.2\n\nB. 1/10 = 0.1\n\nC. 4/10 = 0.4\n\nD. 5/10 = 0.5\n\nSo, again, comparing to 0.4, only 0.5 is greater.\n\nThis reinforces that D. 5/10 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've covered a few different ways to approach this, and each method points to the same conclusion. It's good to have multiple ways to verify the answer, especially when dealing with fractions, as they can sometimes be tricky.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
