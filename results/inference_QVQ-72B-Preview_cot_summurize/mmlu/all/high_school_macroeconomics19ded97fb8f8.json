                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about centrally planned economic systems. I need to pick which option is characteristic of such a system. Let me go through each one and see.\n\nOption A says that resources are allocated based on relative prices. Hmm, in a centrally planned economy, I think the government decides how to allocate resources, right? So, it's not necessarily based on prices determined by the market. Maybe prices are set by the government, but it's not the same as allocation based on relative prices determined by supply and demand. So, maybe this isn't the best fit.\n\nOption B mentions the circular flow of goods and services and says that it minimizes the role of the federal government. But in a centrally planned economy, the federal government plays a huge role, right? They plan and control the production and distribution of goods and services. So, this option seems to suggest less government involvement, which is the opposite of a centrally planned economy. Probably not the correct choice.\n\nOption C says that private ownership of resources is fundamental to economic growth. Again, in a centrally planned economy, typically the means of production are owned by the state or the government, not by private individuals. So, this doesn't seem to align with the characteristics of a centrally planned system. Maybe this is more related to a market economy or capitalism.\n\nOption D states that government planners decide how best to produce goods and services. This sounds a lot like a centrally planned economy. In such systems, the government makes decisions about what to produce, how much to produce, and for whom to produce, rather than these decisions being made by individual firms or consumers through market mechanisms.\n\nLet me double-check. Centrally planned economies are also known as command economies, where the government plays a dominant role in directing economic activity. So, if I recall correctly, in this type of economy, the government sets production targets, allocates resources, and determines prices. Private ownership is limited, and the market has minimal influence on economic decisions.\n\nGiven that, option D seems to accurately describe a key feature of a centrally planned economic system: that government planners decide how to produce goods and services.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other options could also be characteristics of a centrally planned economy.\n\nOption A: Resources are allocated based on relative prices. In a market economy, prices signal where resources are needed or where they can be used most efficiently. But in a centrally planned economy, resource allocation is supposed to be directed by the government based on plans and objectives, not necessarily by market prices.\n\nOption B: The circular flow of goods and services minimizes the role of the federal government. The circular flow model describes how goods and services move between households and firms in an economy. In a centrally planned economy, this flow is heavily managed and directed by the government, so minimizing the government's role wouldn't align with that.\n\nOption C: Private ownership of resources is fundamental to economic growth. While some centrally planned economies may allow limited private ownership, the foundation of such economies is typically based on public or state ownership of the means of production. So, this option doesn't fit well.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate characteristic of a centrally planned economic system is option D: government planners decide how best to produce goods and services.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
