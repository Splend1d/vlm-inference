                    "text": "So I've got this problem about a soft drink dispenser that can be adjusted to deliver a fixed number of ounces, and it's supposed to fill a 12-ounce cup without overflowing more than 1% of the time. The standard deviation of the delivery is 0.3 ounces, and we're supposed to assume a normal distribution for the ounces delivered. I need to find the mean setting for the dispenser to meet this requirement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it's asking. We have a normal distribution with a certain mean (which we need to find) and a standard deviation of 0.3 ounces. The cups are 12 ounces, and we want the dispenser to fill these cups in such a way that the drink doesn't overflow more than 1% of the time.\n\nSo, in other words, we want the probability that the dispenser delivers more than 12 ounces to be less than 1%. That means that 99% of the time, the dispenser should deliver less than or equal to 12 ounces.\n\nSince we're dealing with a normal distribution, we can use the properties of the normal distribution to find the mean that satisfies this condition.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\( \\mu \\) = mean ounces delivered by the dispenser\n\n- \\( \\sigma \\) = standard deviation = 0.3 ounces\n\nWe want \\( P(X > 12) < 0.01 \\)\n\nAlternatively, \\( P(X \\leq 12) > 0.99 \\)\n\nSo, we need to find \\( \\mu \\) such that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution at 12 is greater than 0.99.\n\nIn standard normal distribution terms, this means:\n\n\\( P\\left( Z \\leq \\frac{12 - \\mu}{0.3} \\right) = 0.99 \\)\n\nWhere \\( Z \\) is the standard normal variable.\n\nI can look up the value of \\( Z \\) that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.99. From standard normal distribution tables, the Z-score for a cumulative probability of 0.99 is approximately 2.326.\n\nSo,\n\n\\( \\frac{12 - \\mu}{0.3} = 2.326 \\)\n\nNow, I can solve for \\( \\mu \\):\n\n\\( 12 - \\mu = 2.326 \\times 0.3 \\)\n\n\\( 12 - \\mu = 0.6978 \\)\n\n\\( -\\mu = 0.6978 - 12 \\)\n\n\\( -\\mu = -11.3022 \\)\n\n\\( \\mu = 11.3022 \\) ounces\n\nWait a minute, but this doesn't match any of the options provided. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\( P(X \\leq 12) = 0.99 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( P\\left( Z \\leq \\frac{12 - \\mu}{0.3} \\right) = 0.99 \\)\n\nWhich implies:\n\n\\( \\frac{12 - \\mu}{0.3} = 2.326 \\)\n\nThen,\n\n\\( 12 - \\mu = 2.326 \\times 0.3 = 0.6978 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( -\\mu = 0.6978 - 12 = -11.3022 \\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\( \\mu = 11.3022 \\) ounces\n\nBut this isn't matching any of the options. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem or the options.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA. 12 - 0.99(0.3) ounces\n\nB. 12 - 2.326(0.3) ounces\n\nC. 12 - 2.576(0.3) ounces\n\nD. 12 + 2.326(0.3) ounces\n\nOption B is 12 - 2.326(0.3) ounces.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n2.326 \u00d7 0.3 = 0.6978\n\nSo, 12 - 0.6978 = 11.3022 ounces\n\nWhich is what I calculated earlier.\n\nBut the options are presented in the form of 12 minus some value times the standard deviation.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider that the mean should be set below 12 ounces such that only 1% of the time it exceeds 12 ounces.\n\nSo, indeed, \\( \\mu = 12 - z \\times \\sigma \\), where z is the Z-score corresponding to 99th percentile, which is 2.326.\n\nSo, \\( \\mu = 12 - 2.326 \\times 0.3 \\)\n\nWhich is option B.\n\nBut earlier, I calculated \\( \\mu = 11.3022 \\), which matches option B.\n\nSo, perhaps the confusion is just in the way the options are presented.\n\nOption B is 12 - 2.326(0.3) ounces, which is indeed 11.3022 ounces.\n\nBut the question is asking for the mean setting, which is \\( \\mu \\), and that's 11.3022 ounces.\n\nBut looking back, perhaps the question is phrased to choose the mean setting in terms of the Z-score and standard deviation, not to compute a numerical value.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is option B: 12 - 2.326(0.3) ounces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the general formula.\n\nIf we have a normal distribution \\( X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2) \\), and we want \\( P(X > 12) < 0.01 \\), which is equivalent to \\( P(X \\leq 12) > 0.99 \\).\n\nThe Z-score corresponding to 0.99 is indeed approximately 2.326.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\n\\( Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\)\n\nSetting \\( Z = 2.326 \\), \\( X = 12 \\), \\( \\sigma = 0.3 \\), we get:\n\n\\( 2.326 = \\frac{12 - \\mu}{0.3} \\)\n\nThen,\n\n\\( 12 - \\mu = 2.326 \\times 0.3 = 0.6978 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( \\mu = 12 - 0.6978 = 11.3022 \\) ounces\n\nWhich corresponds to option B.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the Z-score formula for the upper tail:\n\n\\( P(X > 12) = 0.01 \\)\n\nWhich corresponds to a Z-score of 2.326 (from standard normal tables).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( Z = \\frac{12 - \\mu}{0.3} = 2.326 \\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\( 12 - \\mu = 2.326 \\times 0.3 = 0.6978 \\)\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\( \\mu = 12 - 0.6978 = 11.3022 \\) ounces\n\nAgain, this points to option B.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nMaybe using the concept of confidence intervals or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about setting the mean such that the probability of overfilling is less than 1%, considering the standard deviation.\n\nBut I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the inverse normal function in a calculator or software to find the exact Z-score for 0.99 probability.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, the Z-score for which the cumulative probability is 0.99 is approximately 2.326.\n\nSo, confirming my earlier calculation.\n\nThus, the mean setting should be \\( \\mu = 12 - 2.326 \\times 0.3 \\) ounces.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option B: 12 - 2.326(0.3) ounces.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
