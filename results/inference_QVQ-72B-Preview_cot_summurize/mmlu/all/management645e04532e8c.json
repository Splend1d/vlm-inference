This is often referred to as the management process or the managerial functions framework. It is a widely accepted model that outlines the activities managers perform to achieve organisational goals.\n\nFirst, planning involves setting objectives and determining how to achieve them. This includes developing strategies, policies, and procedures. Planning is crucial as it provides direction and focus for the organisation.\n\nSecond, organising involves arranging resources, both human and material, to implement the plans. This includes structuring the organisation, assigning tasks, and allocating resources effectively.\n\nThird, leading involves motivating and directing employees to work towards achieving the organisation's objectives. This includes communicating, inspiring, and providing guidance to team members.\n\nFinally, controlling involves monitoring progress and taking corrective action when necessary to ensure that the organisation stays on track to achieve its goals. This includes measuring performance against plans and making adjustments as needed.\n\nSo, the correct order is planning, organising, leading, and controlling.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. planning, organising, leading, controlling}} \\]"
