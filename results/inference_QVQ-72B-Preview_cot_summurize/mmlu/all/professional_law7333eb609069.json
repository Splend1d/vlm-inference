The contract provided the following:\"The cost is $2,500 per deck, to be paid upon completion of the decks in each of the eight beach houses. \"On the morning of March 25, the man went to one of the beach houses as the contractor and his assistants were completing the work on the fourth deck. The man said to the contractor, \"I'm very pleased with your progress to date. If you are willing, I would like you to build the same kind of decks on four identical beach houses that I own in a neighboring town, on the same terms and conditions as our existing contract, the work to be completed by May 20. If you can meet that deadline, I'll pay you $10,000 at that time. \" The contractor replied, \"Agreed. Let's shake hands on it. \" They shook hands. The contractor completed the work on the beach houses located in the city by April 15 and immediately started the construction of the decks on the four beach houses located in the town. On April 22, a hurricane totally destroyed four of the man's beach houses in the city. In addition, the hurricane demolished a beach house in the town on which the contractor had completed 85 percent of the deck work. Two of the contractor's assistants were seriously injured, and all of his equipment was washed away. The man then received a letter from the contractor, which stated:\"The hurricane destroyed my equipment, worth $4,000. I am dead broke and cannot complete the work on the three remaining beach houses in the town. Please pay me $20,000 for the work I did in the city, and please send me $2,500 for the deck I built on the beach house in the town. \"What is the maximum amount that the contractor may recover from the man for the construction that he completed prior to the hurricane?\n\nA. $10,000. 00\nB. $10,000 plus the amount due for 85 percent of the completed work on the town beach house.\nC. $20,000. 00\nD. $20,000 plus the amount due for 85 percent of the work completed on the town beach house.\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into this contract dispute problem. It's a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a contract between a man and a contractor to build two-level redwood decks on eight specified beach houses in a city. The cost is $2,500 per deck, and payment is due upon completion of each deck. The work was supposed to be finished by May 1.\n\nOn March 25, the man goes to one of the beach houses and finds the contractor finishing the fourth deck. He's pleased with the progress and offers the contractor additional work: building similar decks on four identical beach houses in a neighboring town, under the same terms and conditions as the original contract, with the work to be completed by May 20. As an incentive, he promises to pay an extra $10,000 upon completion of this additional work. The contractor agrees, they shake hands, and that's that.\n\nThe contractor finishes the city beach houses by April 15, which is ahead of schedule, and starts work on the town beach houses immediately. Unfortunately, on April 22, a hurricane strikes. It destroys four of the man's beach houses in the city and demolishes one of the town beach houses where the contractor had completed 85% of the deck work. Additionally, two of the contractor's assistants are injured, and all his equipment is lost.\n\nAfter the disaster, the contractor writes to the man, explaining his situation. He's lost his equipment worth $4,000 and is unable to complete the remaining work on the three town beach houses. He requests payment for the work done in the city ($20,000 for eight decks at $2,500 each) and an additional $2,500 for the deck in the town that was 85% completed.\n\nNow, the question is: what's the maximum amount the contractor can recover from the man for the construction completed before the hurricane?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. $10,000.00\n\nB. $10,000 plus the amount due for 85 percent of the completed work on the town beach house.\n\nC. $20,000.00\n\nD. $20,000 plus the amount due for 85 percent of the work completed on the town beach house.\n\nI need to figure out which of these is correct.\n\nFirst, let's consider the original contract for the city beach houses. The contractor built eight decks at $2,500 each, so that's 8 * $2,500 = $20,000. The payment is due upon completion of each deck, and since all eight were completed by April 15, the contractor should be entitled to that $20,000.\n\nNow, regarding the additional work in the town, there was an agreement to build decks on four beach houses there, with the same terms and conditions as the original contract, plus an extra $10,000 upon completion.\n\nThe contractor started work on the town beach houses after finishing the city ones and had completed 85% of one deck before the hurricane struck.\n\nGiven that the hurricane destroyed four city beach houses and one town beach house where work was partially done, we need to consider the implications of these destructions.\n\nFirst, for the city beach houses, the decks were already completed and presumably paid for upon completion, as per the contract. So, the destruction by the hurricane shouldn't affect the contractor's entitlement to payment for those decks.\n\nFor the town beach houses, the contractor had completed 85% of one deck before the hurricane. The hurricane destroyed that beach house, but the contractor had already put in 85% of the work.\n\nAssuming that the contract allows for payment based on the percentage of work completed, the contractor might be entitled to 85% of the agreed price for that deck.\n\nHowever, the hurricane also destroyed three other beach houses in the town where no work had been started, and one where 85% of the deck was completed.\n\nAdditionally, the contractor is unable to complete the remaining work on the three town beach houses due to his losses.\n\nSo, what's the maximum the contractor can recover?\n\nLet's consider that the original contract for the city beach houses is separate from the additional agreement for the town beach houses.\n\nThe man owes $20,000 for the eight city decks completed.\n\nFor the town beach houses, there was an oral agreement (they shook hands) to build decks on four beach houses under the same terms and conditions as the original contract, plus an extra $10,000 upon completion.\n\nAssuming that the \"same terms and conditions\" include payment upon completion of each deck at $2,500 per deck, plus the extra $10,000 upon completion of all four decks.\n\nHowever, only one deck was 85% completed, and the hurricane destroyed that beach house.\n\nSo, the contractor has put in work equivalent to 85% of one deck in the town.\n\nIf the contract allows for payment based on the percentage of work completed, then the contractor should be entitled to 85% of $2,500, which is $2,125 for that deck.\n\nBut, the beach house was destroyed, so perhaps there's some risk allocation here. Typically, in construction contracts, there's a clause about force majeure events like hurricanes, which can excuse performance by either party.\n\nHowever, in this case, some work was done, and the contractor is seeking payment for that work.\n\nAssuming that the man is insured for such losses or that the risk of destruction rests with the man, the contractor should still be entitled to payment for the work done.\n\nMoreover, the extra $10,000 was contingent upon completion of all four town decks by May 20. Since only one deck was partially completed, and the contractor is unable to finish the work, he likely isn't entitled to that $10,000 bonus.\n\nTherefore, the maximum the contractor can recover would be:\n\n- $20,000 for the eight city decks\n\n- Plus $2,125 for the 85% completed deck in the town\n\nThat totals to $22,125.\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nA. $10,000.00\n\nThis seems too low and doesn't account for the eight completed city decks.\n\nB. $10,000 plus the amount due for 85 percent of the completed work on the town beach house.\n\nThis suggests $10,000 plus $2,125, which is $12,125, but that doesn't include the $20,000 for the city decks.\n\nC. $20,000.00\n\nThis only accounts for the city decks, ignoring the partial work done in the town.\n\nD. $20,000 plus the amount due for 85 percent of the work completed on the town beach house.\n\nThis adds up to $20,000 + $2,125 = $22,125, which seems the most accurate based on my calculations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. $20,000 plus the amount due for 85 percent of the work completed on the town beach house.\n\nBut wait, option D doesn't specify the exact amount, just describes it as \"the amount due for 85 percent of the work completed on the town beach house.\" So, it's not clear if the examiner expects a specific dollar amount or just the description.\n\nIn any case, D seems to be the most comprehensive option, encompassing both the city decks and the partial work in the town.\n\nSo, I'll go with D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
