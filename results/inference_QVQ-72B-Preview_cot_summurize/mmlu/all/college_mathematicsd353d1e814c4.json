The nonzero integers under multiplication\n\nC. The nonzero real numbers under multiplication\n\nD. The complex numbers under addition\n\nAlright, I need to recall what defines a group. From my abstract algebra class, I remember that a group is a set equipped with an operation that satisfies four properties:\n\n1. Closure: If you take any two elements from the set and perform the operation on them, the result is still within the set.\n\n2. Associativity: The operation is associative, meaning that when performing the operation on three elements, it doesn't matter how you group them.\n\n3. Identity element: There exists an element in the set that, when combined with any other element under the operation, leaves that element unchanged.\n\n4. Inverse element: For every element in the set, there is another element that, when combined with it under the operation, yields the identity element.\n\nSo, I need to check each option against these four group axioms.\n\nLet's start with option A: The integers under addition.\n\n1. Closure: If I take two integers and add them, I get another integer. Seems closed.\n\n2. Associativity: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c). Yes, addition of integers is associative.\n\n3. Identity element: 0 is the additive identity because a + 0 = a for any integer a.\n\n4. Inverse element: For any integer a, there exists -a such that a + (-a) = 0.\n\nAll four properties hold, so option A is a group.\n\nNext, option B: The nonzero integers under multiplication.\n\n1. Closure: Multiply two nonzero integers, and you get another nonzero integer. Seems closed.\n\n2. Associativity: (a \u00d7 b) \u00d7 c = a \u00d7 (b \u00d7 c). Yes, multiplication of integers is associative.\n\n3. Identity element: 1 is the multiplicative identity because a \u00d7 1 = a for any nonzero integer a.\n\n4. Inverse element: For each a, there needs to be a b such that a \u00d7 b = 1. For nonzero integers, this would require b = 1/a. But 1/a is not an integer unless a is \u00b11. So, for a = 2, 3, etc., 1/a is not an integer. Therefore, inverses don't exist for all elements.\n\nThis means that option B is NOT a group because it fails the inverse element property.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. In the case of integers, only \u00b11 have multiplicative inverses that are also integers. For example, 2 \u00d7 1/2 = 1, but 1/2 is not an integer. So, indeed, inverses don't exist for all nonzero integers. Therefore, this set does not satisfy the group axioms.\n\nNow, option C: The nonzero real numbers under multiplication.\n\n1. Closure: Multiply two nonzero real numbers, and you get another nonzero real number. Yes.\n\n2. Associativity: (a \u00d7 b) \u00d7 c = a \u00d7 (b \u00d7 c). Yes, multiplication of real numbers is associative.\n\n3. Identity element: 1 is the multiplicative identity because a \u00d7 1 = a for any nonzero real number a.\n\n4. Inverse element: For each a, there exists b = 1/a such that a \u00d7 b = 1. Since a is nonzero, 1/a is also a real number. So, inverses exist.\n\nAll four properties hold, so option C is a group.\n\nLastly, option D: The complex numbers under addition.\n\n1. Closure: Adding two complex numbers gives another complex number. Yes.\n\n2. Associativity: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c). Yes, addition of complex numbers is associative.\n\n3. Identity element: 0 + 0i is the additive identity because adding it to any complex number a + bi gives a + bi.\n\n4. Inverse element: For any complex number a + bi, its additive inverse is -a - bi, which is also a complex number, since both a and b are real numbers.\n\nAll four properties hold, so option D is a group.\n\nTherefore, the only option that is NOT a group is option B: The nonzero integers under multiplication, because it fails to have inverses for all its elements.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think if there are any other potential issues with the other options.\n\nOption A: Integers under addition\u2014seems solid.\n\nOption C: Nonzero real numbers under multiplication\u2014correct, as the multiplicative inverses exist in the set.\n\nOption D: Complex numbers under addition\u2014no issues there; inverses exist and all axioms are satisfied.\n\nSo, my final answer is option B: The nonzero integers under multiplication is NOT a group.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
