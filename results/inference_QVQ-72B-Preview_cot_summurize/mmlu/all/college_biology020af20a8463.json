                    "text": "So I have this question about flower adaptations for pollination by hummingbirds versus bees. It's asking which adaptation would limit pollination by bees and promote pollination by hummingbirds. The options are:\n\nA. Patterns of ultraviolet color on the petals\n\nB. Modified petals to provide a landing space\n\nC. Pendant (hanging) red-colored flowers\n\nD. Nectar with high sugar concentration produced in limited amounts\n\nFirst, I need to understand the differences in how bees and hummingbirds interact with flowers.\n\nBees are insect pollinators. They typically land on flowers to collect nectar and pollen. Bees can see certain colors, like yellows and blues, but their vision extends into the ultraviolet spectrum, which humans can't see. Many flowers have ultraviolet patterns that guide bees to the nectar.\n\nHummingbirds, on the other hand, are bird pollinators. They don't land on flowers; instead, they hover and feed from them. They have a long beak and tongue adapted for reaching into tubular flowers to extract nectar.\n\nGiven that, I need to think about which of these adaptations would make it harder for bees to pollinate and easier for hummingbirds.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Patterns of ultraviolet color on the petals: Since bees can see ultraviolet light and are attracted to these patterns, having such patterns would likely attract bees more, not less. So, this seems counterintuitive for limiting bee pollination.\n\nB. Modified petals to provide a landing space: Bees need a landing platform to land on while they feed. If petals are modified to provide such a space, that would again attract bees. Hummingbirds don't land; they hover, so they wouldn't necessarily need or use a landing space. So, this adaptation seems to favor bees over hummingbirds.\n\nC. Pendant (hanging) red-colored flowers: Hummingbirds are attracted to red flowers, which stand out against green foliage. Also, pendant flowers are often tubular and hang down, which is ideal for hummingbirds to hover and feed without having to land. Bees, however, might have difficulty accessing nectar from hanging flowers, especially if the flowers are designed to be fed from below by hovering birds.\n\nD. Nectar with high sugar concentration produced in limited amounts: Hummingbirds have a high metabolic rate and need a lot of energy, so they prefer nectar with higher sugar concentrations. Bees, however, can handle a range of nectar concentrations. But if the nectar is produced in limited amounts, that might not directly affect pollination efficiency for either pollinator. Maybe the flower relies on a steady stream of pollinators to empty the nectar and ensure pollination.\n\nConsidering these points, option C seems the most straightforward for promoting hummingbird pollination while limiting bee pollination. Pendant, red-colored flowers are characteristic of plants that rely on hummingbirds for pollination, as they are easily accessible to hovering birds and less so to bees that would need a landing platform.\n\nBut let me double-check. If I choose C, I'm saying that pendant red-colored flowers would limit bee pollination and promote hummingbird pollination. That makes sense because bees might have trouble reaching the nectar in hanging flowers without a proper landing space, whereas hummingbirds can easily hover and feed from them.\n\nOption A seems to favor bees, which is the opposite of what we want. Option B also favors bees by providing a landing space. Option D might slightly favor hummingbirds due to the nectar composition, but it's not as direct as the floral structure in option C.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C. Pendant (hanging) red-colored flowers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
