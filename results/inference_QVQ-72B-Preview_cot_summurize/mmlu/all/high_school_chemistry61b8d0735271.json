                    "text": "Let's tackle this chemistry problem. I have 1.0 g of rubidium (Rb) and 1.0 g of bromine (Br2), and they react to form rubidium bromide (RbBr). I need to figure out what will be left in measurable amounts (more than 0.10 mg) in the reaction vessel after the reaction is complete.\n\nFirst, I should write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. Rubidium reacts with bromine to form rubidium bromide:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rb} + \\text{Br}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{RbBr}\n\\]\n\nThis looks straightforward; it's a one-to-one ratio between Rb and Br\u2082 to produce RbBr.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the molar masses of Rb and Br\u2082 to determine how many moles of each I have.\n\nThe atomic mass of Rb (rubidium) is approximately 85.47 g/mol.\n\nThe molecular mass of Br\u2082 (bromine) is approximately 159.80 g/mol since bromine has an atomic mass of about 79.904 g/mol and there are two bromine atoms in Br\u2082.\n\nSo, for 1.0 g of Rb:\n\n\\[\n\\text{moles of Rb} = \\frac{1.0 \\, \\text{g}}{85.47 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 0.0117 \\, \\text{mol}\n\\]\n\nFor 1.0 g of Br\u2082:\n\n\\[\n\\text{moles of Br}_2 = \\frac{1.0 \\, \\text{g}}{159.80 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 0.00625 \\, \\text{mol}\n\\]\n\nLooking at the balanced equation, it's a 1:1 ratio, meaning 1 mole of Rb reacts with 1 mole of Br\u2082 to produce 1 mole of RbBr.\n\nComparing the moles:\n\n- Moles of Rb: 0.0117 mol\n\n- Moles of Br\u2082: 0.00625 mol\n\nSince the ratio is 1:1, the limiting reagent is Br\u2082 because it has fewer moles available.\n\nSo, Br\u2082 will be completely consumed in the reaction. Now, I need to find out how much Rb will be left unreacted.\n\nGiven that Br\u2082 is the limiting reagent, all of it will react with an equal amount of Rb.\n\nSo, moles of Rb that will react = moles of Br\u2082 = 0.00625 mol\n\nTotal moles of Rb initially = 0.0117 mol\n\nMoles of Rb left unreacted = 0.0117 mol - 0.00625 mol = 0.00525 mol\n\nNow, I need to find out what mass this corresponds to.\n\nMass of Rb left:\n\n\\[\n\\text{mass} = \\text{moles} \\times \\text{molar mass} = 0.00525 \\, \\text{mol} \\times 85.47 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\approx 0.45 g\n\\]\n\nSo, after the reaction, I'll have:\n\n- RbBr produced from the reaction\n\n- And 0.45 g of Rb left unreacted\n\nWait a minute, the problem asks for what will be left in measurable amounts (more than 0.10 mg). Both RbBr and the remaining Rb are well above 0.10 mg, but Br\u2082 is completely consumed, so nothing should be left.\n\nBut let's double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, molar masses:\n\n- Rb: 85.47 g/mol\n\n- Br\u2082: 79.904 g/mol \u00d7 2 = 159.808 g/mol (approximately 159.80 g/mol)\n\nThen, moles:\n\n- Rb: 1.0 g / 85.47 g/mol = 0.0117 mol\n\n- Br\u2082: 1.0 g / 159.80 g/mol = 0.00625 mol\n\nSince Br\u2082 is less, it's the limiting reagent.\n\nMoles of Rb that react: 0.00625 mol\n\nMoles of Rb left: 0.0117 mol - 0.00625 mol = 0.00545 mol\n\nMass of Rb left: 0.00545 mol \u00d7 85.47 g/mol \u2248 0.467 g\n\nWait, earlier I had 0.00525 mol, but now it's 0.00545 mol. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{moles of Rb left} = 0.0117 \\, \\text{mol} - 0.00625 \\, \\text{mol} = 0.00545 \\, \\text{mol}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{mass of Rb left} = 0.00545 \\, \\text{mol} \\times 85.47 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\approx 0.467 \\, \\text{g}\n\\]\n\nSo, approximately 0.467 g of Rb is left.\n\nTherefore, after the reaction, we have:\n\n- RbBr\n\n- And some Rb left\n\nBr\u2082 is completely consumed, so nothing is left of it.\n\nSo, according to this, the answer should be B. RbBr and Rb only.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any possibility of other products or incomplete reactions.\n\nRubidium is an alkali metal, and bromine is a halogen. Their reaction should be straightforward to produce RbBr.\n\nGiven that, and the calculations showing that Rb is in excess, it's reasonable to conclude that only Rb and RbBr are present in measurable amounts after the reaction.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there could be any residual Br\u2082 left or if the reaction goes to completion.\n\nGiven that the reaction is likely to go to completion under standard conditions, especially since alkali metals are highly reactive, it's safe to assume that all Br\u2082 reacts with available Rb.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is B. RbBr and Rb only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
