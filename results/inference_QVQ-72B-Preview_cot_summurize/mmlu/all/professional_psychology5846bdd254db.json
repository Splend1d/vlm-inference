                    "text": "So I have this question here about research designs. It's asking in which type of research there is no manipulation done by the researcher and the variables are just measured, not manipulated. The options are quasi-experimental research, true experimental research, correlational research, and developmental research. I need to pick the correct answer based on my knowledge of research designs.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each type of research involves.\n\nStarting with quasi-experimental research: I think this is a type of study where the researcher can't randomly assign participants to different groups, maybe due to ethical or practical reasons. So, there might be some manipulation or intervention, but it's not as controlled as in a true experiment. Maybe it involves comparing groups that already exist, like comparing students from different schools that have different teaching methods. But in this case, the researcher didn't manipulate the teaching methods; they just measure the outcomes and see if there are differences.\n\nNext, true experimental research: This is the gold standard in research designs. It involves manipulating one variable (the independent variable) to see its effect on another variable (the dependent variable). Researchers randomly assign participants to experimental and control groups to ensure that the groups are equivalent in every way except for the manipulation of the independent variable. So, in this type of research, the researcher is definitely manipulating variables to observe effects.\n\nCorrelational research: This sounds familiar. I think in correlational studies, researchers measure variables without manipulating them and look for relationships between those variables. For example, they might look at the relationship between the number of hours spent studying and exam scores. They don't manipulate the study time; they just measure it and see if there's a correlation with exam performance. So, in this type of research, there's no manipulation of variables; they're just being measured.\n\nDevelopmental research: This seems to focus on how things change over time, especially in the context of human development, like child development or aging processes. Researchers might follow the same group of people over several years or decades and measure changes in various aspects, such as cognitive abilities or social behaviors. Again, the researcher isn't manipulating the variables; they're observing and measuring natural changes over time.\n\nSo, comparing these options:\n\n- Quasi-experimental research involves some manipulation, but not as controlled as in true experiments.\n\n- True experimental research involves direct manipulation of variables with random assignment.\n\n- Correlational research involves measuring variables and looking for relationships without manipulation.\n\n- Developmental research involves measuring variables over time without manipulating them.\n\nGiven that the question specifies that there is no manipulation of variables and they are just measured, it seems that both correlational and developmental research fit this description.\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to think deeper. In developmental research, although the researcher doesn't manipulate the variables, the passage of time itself could be seen as a manipulation, but that's a bit subjective. However, generally, developmental research is considered non-experimental because the researcher doesn't manipulate independent variables but rather observes natural changes over time.\n\nOn the other hand, correlational research explicitly avoids manipulation and simply measures variables as they naturally occur to determine if there is a relationship between them.\n\nPerhaps the key difference is that correlational research is cross-sectional, meaning it measures variables at one point in time across different individuals, whereas developmental research might be longitudinal, measuring the same individuals over time.\n\nBut in both cases, there's no manipulation of variables by the researcher.\n\nSo, between options C and D, both seem to fit the description of no manipulation and just measuring variables.\n\nBut the question is to choose the correct answer based on my knowledge, and perhaps there's a better fit among these options.\n\nLet me consider if there's any difference in how variables are treated in correlational versus developmental research.\n\nIn correlational research, the focus is on the relationship between variables at a particular time, without implying cause and effect. In developmental research, the focus is on changes over time, possibly looking for patterns or trends, but again, without manipulating variables.\n\nGiven that, both types of research involve measuring variables without manipulating them.\n\nHowever, perhaps the question is trying to emphasize that in correlational research, variables are specifically not manipulated, and the primary goal is to find associations, not causations.\n\nIn developmental research, while variables are not manipulated, the focus is more on understanding developmental processes and changes over time, which might involve multiple variables and their interactions.\n\nBut still, both types of research involve measuring variables without manipulating them.\n\nMaybe I need to think about the context of the question. It might be that the question is trying to test understanding of experimental versus non-experimental designs, with a specific emphasis on manipulation.\n\nIn that case, experimental designs involve manipulation of variables to establish cause and effect, while non-experimental designs, like correlational and developmental research, do not manipulate variables and are used to describe relationships or changes without establishing causality.\n\nGiven that, both C and D seem correct, but perhaps the question is expecting a single best answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing knowledge about specific research designs and their characteristics.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there's a difference in how variables are treated in correlational versus developmental research that makes one of them a better fit for the description provided.\n\nLet me think about correlational research again. In correlational studies, researchers measure two or more variables and assess whether they are related. For example, they might look at the relationship between hours of sleep and academic performance. They collect data on both variables but do not manipulate either; they just observe and measure.\n\nIn developmental research, researchers might study how certain characteristics change as people age. For example, they might measure cognitive abilities at different age points. Again, they are not manipulating any variables; they are observing and measuring natural changes over time.\n\nSo, both types involve measurement without manipulation.\n\nPerhaps the difference lies in the focus: correlational research focuses on relationships between variables at a given time, while developmental research focuses on changes over time.\n\nBut the question is about whether variables are manipulated or just measured, and both types fit the \"just measured\" category.\n\nMaybe I need to consider another angle. Perhaps the question is trying to highlight that in quasi-experimental and true experimental research, there is manipulation, whereas in correlational and developmental research, there isn't.\n\nIf that's the case, then both C and D would be correct, but since the question asks to choose the correct answer, and there are four options, with only one expected to be correct, perhaps there's a specific reason to choose one over the other.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing knowledge about correlational research specifically, emphasizing that it involves no manipulation, only measurement.\n\nIn that case, correlational research would be the best answer because it is defined by the absence of manipulation and the measurement of variables to determine relationships.\n\nDevelopmental research, while also involving no manipulation, has a specific focus on development over time, which might not always involve the same type of variable measurement as in correlational studies.\n\nHowever, both types of research involve measuring variables without manipulating them.\n\nPerhaps the key here is that correlational research is primarily about measuring variables and looking for associations, making it a clear example of research without manipulation.\n\nDevelopmental research, while also non-manipulative, might involve more complex designs that could include elements of experimental or quasi-experimental approaches, although in general, it is considered non-experimental.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if developmental research ever involves manipulation.\n\nIn some cases, developmental research might include experimental components, for example, interventions to see their effects on development. However, pure observational developmental studies do not involve manipulation.\n\nGiven that, perhaps developmental research can sometimes involve manipulation, while correlational research, by its nature, does not.\n\nThat might make correlational research the better answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simply testing whether students understand that correlational research does not involve manipulation, making it the correct choice.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the best answer is C. CORRELATIONAL RESEARCH.\n\nThis is because correlational research explicitly involves measuring variables without manipulating them, with the primary goal of finding associations between variables.\n\nDevelopmental research, while also non-manipulative, has a broader focus on developmental processes and changes over time, which might not always fit neatly into the definition provided in the question.\n\nTherefore, correlational research is the most accurate choice for a research design where there is no manipulation of variables, and they are just measured.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
