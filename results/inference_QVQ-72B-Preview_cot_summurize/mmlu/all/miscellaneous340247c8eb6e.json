SNMP, D. SMTP.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what each of these protocols is used for. Starting with BOOTP, I think it's related to booting computers over a network. Yeah, BOOTP stands for Bootstrap Protocol, and it's used for configuring network devices, like assigning IP addresses. So, it doesn't seem to be directly involved in transporting HTML pages.\n\nNext is HTTP. I know that HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It sounds like it's related to transferring hypertext documents, which are basically web pages. So, this seems like a likely candidate. But just to be sure, I'll check the others.\n\nSNMP is the Simple Network Management Protocol. As the name suggests, it's used for managing and monitoring network devices. It's not for transporting web pages.\n\nLastly, there's SMTP, which is the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. This one is used for sending and receiving emails. Again, not for transporting web pages.\n\nSo, by process of elimination, HTTP seems to be the correct answer. But I want to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe I should think about how web pages are actually transmitted.\n\nWhen you type a URL into your browser, the browser sends a request to the web server using HTTP to retrieve the HTML file associated with that URL. The server then responds with the HTML content, which the browser renders into a web page. So, yes, HTTP is indeed used to transport HTML pages from the server to the browser.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there are any other protocols that might be involved in this process. For example, HTTPS is also used for secure web browsing, but that's an extension of HTTP. Moreover, the question specifies \"HTML pages,\" which are typically transported over HTTP.\n\nI don't think it's FTP, which is used for file transfers, or TCP/IP, which is a suite of protocols that includes HTTP. So, no, those aren't the direct protocols for transporting web pages.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the role of the application layer protocols in the TCP/IP model. HTTP is an application-layer protocol, and it's specifically designed for client-server interactions over the web. That fits perfectly with the description of transporting HTML pages from servers to browsers.\n\nOn the other hand, protocols like BOOTP, SNMP, and SMTP are also application-layer protocols but serve different purposes: BOOTP for network configuration, SNMP for network management, and SMTP for email transmission.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. HTTP.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll see if there's any trick here. The question says, \"from Web servers to Web browsers,\" and HTTP is the standard protocol for that. Unless there's some specific scenario where another protocol is used, but in general, HTTP is the way HTML pages are transported.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. HTTP is the protocol used to transport HTML pages from web servers to web browsers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ HTTP} \\]"
