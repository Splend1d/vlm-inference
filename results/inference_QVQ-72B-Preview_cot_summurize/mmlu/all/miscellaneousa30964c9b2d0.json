Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I've heard of the Walker Cup before, but I'm not entirely sure what it is or in which sport it's awarded. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nI know that many sports have cups or trophies named after people, usually someone who was important to the sport or who donated the cup. The Walker Cup sounds like it might be related to golf because I recall that golf has a lot of traditional tournaments and cups, like the Ryder Cup and the Presidents Cup.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with cricket. I'm familiar with the Ashes, which is a famous cricket series between England and Australia, but I don't remember anything called the Walker Cup in cricket. Maybe it's not cricket.\n\nNext, tennis. There's the Davis Cup in tennis, which is an international team competition, and the Fed Cup for women. But again, I don't think there's a Walker Cup in tennis. Maybe not tennis.\n\nThen there's squash. Squash has the World Open and various other tournaments, but I don't recall any Walker Cup in squash. Perhaps not squash.\n\nThat leaves golf. As I thought earlier, golf seems like a likely candidate because of its rich tradition of cups and tournaments. I think the Walker Cup is indeed related to golf.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I should double-check. Let me see if I can recall any details about the Walker Cup.\n\nI think the Walker Cup is an amateur golf competition, possibly involving teams from different countries or regions. It might be played every other year or something like that. Also, I believe it's been around for quite some time, maybe since the early 20th century.\n\nTo make sure I'm not mixing it up with another tournament, let me try to recall some specific details. I think the Walker Cup is contested between amateur golfers from the United States and a team consisting of amateur golfers from Great Britain and Ireland. Yeah, that sounds familiar.\n\nLet me also consider the format. It's likely a match play competition, similar to the Ryder Cup, where points are earned through individual and team matches.\n\nGiven all that, it seems pretty clear that the Walker Cup is associated with golf. So, among the options provided\u2014cricket, tennis, squash, and golf\u2014the correct answer should be golf.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly recap why I think the other options are incorrect:\n\n- Cricket: No recollection of a Walker Cup in cricket.\n\n- Tennis: Familiar with the Davis Cup and Fed Cup, but not a Walker Cup in this sport.\n\n- Squash: Don't remember a Walker Cup in squash; major tournaments include the World Open and various others.\n\n- Golf: Well-known tradition of cups like the Ryder Cup, Presidents Cup, and specifically the Walker Cup for amateur golfers.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. golf.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. golf}} \\]"
