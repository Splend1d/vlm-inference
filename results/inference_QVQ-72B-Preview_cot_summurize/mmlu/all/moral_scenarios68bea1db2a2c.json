                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about moral wrongs, and it's asking which of these two scenarios involves doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I poured the rest of my drink in the kitchen sink.\n\nScenario 2: I woke up at 9 AM this morning after my roommates had gone to work, and turned on the blender to make myself a smoothie.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: Pouring the rest of a drink into the kitchen sink.\n\nHmm, is this morally wrong? Well, it depends on a few things. If the drink was still good and could have been consumed, maybe it's wasteful to pour it out. But is wasting something considered morally wrong? In general, wasting resources might be seen as irresponsible, especially if it's done recklessly or without consideration for others. However, pouring a drink down the sink because you don't want to finish it or it's left over might not be seen as a big deal. It's probably not considered a clear moral wrong in most people's eyes.\n\nBut let's think deeper. If the drink was, say, a glass of water, pouring it out might be seen as wasting a precious resource, especially considering water scarcity issues. But in everyday contexts, accidentally pouring out a glass of water probably isn't viewed as morally wrong. Maybe if it's a repeated pattern of wasting, it could be seen as irresponsible, but just a single instance seems minor.\n\nWhat if the drink was something more valuable, like a glass of wine or a specialty beverage? Even then, pouring it out might be seen as wasteful, but not necessarily morally wrong. Unless there are specific circumstances, like others being in need or something, it's hard to see this as a clear moral wrong.\n\nSo, for Scenario 1, I'm leaning towards \"Not wrong.\"\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Waking up at 9 AM after roommates have gone to work and turning on the blender to make a smoothie.\n\nIs this morally wrong? Well, first, I need to consider if there's anything inherently wrong with making a smoothie at that time. Blenders can be noisy, so if roommates are still sleeping, turning on the blender could be disruptive. But in this scenario, the roommates have already gone to work, so they're not there to be disturbed.\n\nBut what if there are other people in the building who might still be sleeping? Depending on the building's layout and sound insulation, the blender might not disturb others. Assuming it's a typical apartment building, though, there might be some noise transmission.\n\nHowever, 9 AM is a pretty standard time for people to be up and about, especially if the roommates have already left for work. It's possible that most people in the building are also up by that time.\n\nAdditionally, making a smoothie for oneself seems like a harmless activity. It's not like you're doing something that directly harms others or goes against societal norms.\n\nConsidering all this, I don't think turning on a blender at 9 AM after roommates have left for work is a clear moral wrong. It might be slightly inconsiderate if it wakes up neighbors who are still sleeping, but in general, it's probably not something that would be considered morally wrong by ordinary standards in the US in 2020.\n\nSo, for Scenario 2, I also lean towards \"Not wrong.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, pouring a drink into the sink is generally not seen as morally wrong unless there are extreme circumstances, like wasting a rare or needed resource intentionally.\n\nIn Scenario 2, making a smoothie at 9 AM when roommates have left for work isn't likely to be considered morally wrong, as it's a reasonable time to be active and making breakfast or a snack.\n\nSo, yeah, I think D. Not wrong, Not wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
