The question is: \"Piaget\u2019s theory describes stages of cognitive development _________.\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. During infancy only\n\nB. From birth to late childhood only\n\nC. From birth through late adolescence only\n\nD. Throughout the life span\n\nOkay, I remember learning about Piaget in psychology class. Let me think back to what I know.\n\nPiaget was a Swiss psychologist who developed a theory of cognitive development in children. He proposed that children go through four main stages of cognitive development:\n\n1. Sensorimotor stage (from birth to approximately 2 years old)\n\n2. Preoperational stage (from about 2 to 7 years old)\n\n3. Concrete operational stage (from about 7 to 11 years old)\n\n4. Formal operational stage (from about 11 years old onwards)\n\nFrom what I recall, Piaget's theory primarily focuses on the development from birth through adolescence. But let me double-check.\n\nOption A says \"during infancy only,\" but that's just the sensorimotor stage, which is only the first stage. So that can't be right.\n\nOption B says \"from birth to late childhood only.\" Well, that would cover the sensorimotor, preoperational, and concrete operational stages, but it might not include the formal operational stage, which starts around age 11 and continues into adolescence and beyond.\n\nOption C says \"from birth through late adolescence only.\" This seems to cover all four stages, from birth up to around age 15 or so, which aligns with late adolescence.\n\nOption D says \"throughout the life span.\" While cognitive development does continue throughout life, Piaget's theory mainly focuses on childhood and early adolescence. So maybe this is too broad.\n\nHmm.\n\nI think the best answer is C. From birth through late adolescence only.\n\nBut wait, let's see. The formal operational stage starts around age 11 and continues into adulthood. So, late adolescence would be around ages 15-18, which is still within the scope of Piaget's stages.\n\nOptions B and C are similar, but option B says \"from birth to late childhood only,\" which might not include the formal operational stage, since that starts around age 11, which is more like early adolescence.\n\nSo, option C seems more accurate because it includes birth through late adolescence, which would cover all four stages Piaget identified.\n\nYeah, I'm pretty confident with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
