                    "text": "So I have this problem about matrices and their traces. It's about three statements, and I need to figure out which ones are true. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst statement: \"The trace of A^2 is nonnegative.\"\n\nHmm, trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal entries. So, trace of A squared would be the sum of the diagonal entries of A squared. But I'm not sure if that directly tells me anything about the sign of the trace. Maybe I need to think about the properties of the trace and matrix multiplication.\n\nWait, there's a property that trace of a product of matrices is invariant under cyclic permutations. That is, trace(AB) = trace(BA). But I'm not sure if that helps here.\n\nLet me consider a simple example. Suppose A is a 2x2 matrix. Let's take\n\nA = [0, 1; -1, 0]\n\nThen A squared is\n\nA^2 = [0,1;-1,0] * [0,1;-1,0] = [-1,0;0,-1]\n\nSo trace of A^2 is -1 + (-1) = -2, which is negative. But that would mean the statement is not true, because there exists at least one matrix A where trace of A^2 is negative.\n\nBut maybe I should check if this is always the case. Let's try another matrix. Suppose A is the zero matrix, all entries are zero. Then A^2 is also the zero matrix, and its trace is zero, which is nonnegative. So sometimes it's nonnegative, sometimes it's negative. Therefore, this statement is not always true.\n\nWait, but the question is to identify which statements are always true. Since this one isn't always true, I can eliminate options that include this statement.\n\nSecond statement: \"If A^2 = A, then the trace of A is nonnegative.\"\n\nOkay, so we have A^2 = A. That means that A is an idempotent matrix. I recall that for idempotent matrices, there are some nice properties related to their eigenvalues and traces.\n\nThe eigenvalues of an idempotent matrix A satisfy \\lambda^2 = \\lambda, which means \\lambda = 0 or \\lambda = 1. So the eigenvalues are either 0 or 1.\n\nNow, the trace of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues (counted with multiplicity). Therefore, since the eigenvalues are either 0 or 1, the trace of A would be the sum of some number of 0's and 1's, which is a nonnegative integer.\n\nMoreover, the trace can't be negative because the smallest eigenvalue is 0, and the sum of nonnegative numbers is nonnegative.\n\nTherefore, this statement is true.\n\nThird statement: \"The trace of AB is the product of the traces of A and B.\"\n\nSo, trace(AB) = trace(A) * trace(B)\n\nHmm, I think I recall that trace of a product of matrices is not equal to the product of their traces. Instead, trace is additive in the sense that trace(A + B) = trace(A) + trace(B), but for products, it's different.\n\nLet me check with an example. Suppose A and B are both 2x2 matrices:\n\nA = [1, 0; 0, 0], trace(A) = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nB = [0, 0; 0, 1], trace(B) = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nThen AB = [1,0;0,0]*[0,0;0,1] = [0,0;0,0], trace(AB) = 0\n\nBut trace(A)*trace(B) = 1*1 = 1, which is not equal to trace(AB) = 0.\n\nSo this shows that trace(AB) is not equal to trace(A)*trace(B). Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nAlright, so from the three statements:\n\nI. The trace of A^2 is nonnegative. - False, as shown by the counterexample.\n\nII. If A^2 = A, then the trace of A is nonnegative. - True, based on properties of idempotent matrices.\n\nIII. The trace of AB is the product of the traces of A and B. - False, as shown by the counterexample.\n\nTherefore, only statement II is true.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. II only\n\nB. III only\n\nC. I and II only\n\nD. II and III only\n\nSo the correct answer should be A. II only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
