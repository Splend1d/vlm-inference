Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potos\u00ed have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potos\u00ed, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.\nHeinrich von F\u00fcch, \"On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,\" 1744\nWhich of the following factors, not mentioned in the second passage, would have been most likely to create added difficulties for native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about the difficulties faced by native Siberians in fulfilling their tribute obligations. The question refers to a passage from Heinrich von F\u00fcch in 1744, talking about how the Yakut and Tungus natives are being forced to pay yasak tribute, which was like a tax in furs or cash. The passage says that initially, there were lots of furbearing animals like sables and foxes, but now there aren't many left because of overhunting. Also, many natives can't hunt anymore because they've lost their horses, which were probably essential for hunting.\n\nSo, the question is asking which factor not mentioned in this second passage would have most likely created added difficulties for these natives in meeting their tribute obligations. The options are:\n\nA. The arrival of rival hunters from China and Japan\n\nB. The impact of epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers\n\nC. The general warming of the climate during this time period\n\nD. The reduced demand for furs among European and Asian elites\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's already been mentioned in the passage to make sure I don't pick something that's already been covered.\n\nThe passage talks about overhunting leading to a decrease in fur-bearing animals and the loss of horses, which are probably needed for hunting. So, options that relate to further depletion of animal resources or difficulties in hunting would be relevant.\n\nOption A mentions rival hunters from China and Japan. If there were hunters from other countries competing for the same animals, that would indeed make it harder for the natives to find enough furs to pay their tribute. However, the passage already mentions that the animals are depleted due to overhunting, so having more hunters from elsewhere would exacerbate this problem, but it's related to the same issue of overhunting.\n\nOption B talks about epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers. This is something that's not mentioned in the passage. The passage only talks about the loss of animals and horses; it doesn't mention any health issues or diseases affecting the natives. So, if diseases were introduced by the Russians, that could significantly impact the native population's ability to hunt and fulfill their tribute obligations. People getting sick or dying from new diseases would mean fewer hunters available to collect furs.\n\nOption C mentions climate warming during this period. Again, the passage doesn't touch on climate change. But if the climate was warming, that could affect the habitats of the fur-bearing animals, possibly leading to changes in their populations or migration patterns, which could make hunting them more difficult.\n\nOption D talks about reduced demand for furs among European and Asian elites. This is interesting because if the demand for furs decreases, one might think that it would make it easier for the natives to keep more furs for themselves or sell them at higher prices, but the question is about fulfilling their tribute obligations. If the tribute was fixed and the demand decreased, it might actually make it harder because the natives might have to sell more furs at lower prices to make up the tribute amount, assuming the tribute was paid in cash based on fur values.\n\nBut let's think more carefully.\n\nFirst, the passage mentions that the tribute was paid in furs or cash. If the demand for furs decreased, the price of furs would likely drop, making it harder for the natives to earn enough cash from selling furs to fulfill their tribute obligations, especially if the tribute amount was fixed in terms of cash.\n\nHowever, if the tribute was fixed in terms of the number of furs, and demand decreased, perhaps the natives could more easily fulfill their quota since there would be less competition for furs in the market. But this seems a bit convoluted, and I'm not sure about the exact nature of the tribute system in this context.\n\nLet me consider each option again in relation to the passage.\n\nOption A: Rival hunters from China and Japan. This would add to the pressure on animal resources, which is already a problem mentioned in the passage. So, it's related but not entirely new; it's an extension of the overhunting issue.\n\nOption B: Epidemic diseases. This is a completely new factor not mentioned in the passage and could severely impact the native population's ability to hunt and fulfill their obligations.\n\nOption C: Climate warming. This is also a new factor not mentioned in the passage and could affect animal habitats and hunting practices.\n\nOption D: Reduced demand for furs. This is another new factor that could affect the natives' ability to earn enough from furs to pay their tribute, especially if the tribute was in cash.\n\nNow, I need to decide which of these would most likely create added difficulties for the natives.\n\nOption B, epidemic diseases, would directly impact the health and numbers of the native population, reducing the number of people available to hunt. This seems like a significant difficulty.\n\nOption C, climate warming, could indirectly affect hunting by changing animal habitats, but this might be a slower process and less immediate than the impact of diseases.\n\nOption D, reduced demand for furs, could make it financially harder if the tribute was in cash, but it might allow natives to keep more furs for themselves if they didn't have to sell as many.\n\nGiven that, option B seems the most direct and impactful factor not mentioned in the passage that would create added difficulties for the natives in fulfilling their tribute obligations.\n\nBut let me think about whether there's any information that might tilt me towards another option.\n\nLooking back at the passage, it mentions that almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses. So, loss of horses is a significant issue affecting hunting capabilities.\n\nOption A, rival hunters, would further deplete the animal resources, making it even harder for the natives to find furs, especially since many can't hunt without horses.\n\nOption C, climate warming, could potentially affect the availability of horses or change the types of animals present, but this is speculative.\n\nOption D, reduced demand, could affect the natives' ability to sell furs for cash, but if the tribute was in furs, perhaps they could still fulfill their obligations by handing over the required number of furs, regardless of the market demand.\n\nHowever, if the tribute was in cash and furs were sold to obtain that cash, then reduced demand would make it harder to earn enough cash from selling furs.\n\nBut the passage says they pay yasak tribute in sables, red foxes, or cash. So, it seems like furs could be part of the tribute directly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option D isn't as relevant, because even if demand decreases, as long as they can provide the required number of furs, it might not be a direct issue.\n\nOn the other hand, option B, epidemic diseases, would reduce the number of hunters, which would directly affect the ability to collect furs, regardless of demand.\n\nOption C, climate warming, could affect animal populations over time, but it's less immediate than disease outbreaks.\n\nTherefore, I think option B is the most likely factor not mentioned in the passage that would create added difficulties for the natives in fulfilling their tribute obligations.\n\nSo, my answer is B. The impact of epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
