                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 24-year-old woman who's been experiencing some gastrointestinal issues. She's been having abdominal bloating, upper abdominal discomfort, and constipation for the past six months. Interestingly, her symptoms seem to get worse when she's stressed, like when she's preparing for exams, but they improve after she has a bowel movement. She doesn't take any medications, doesn't smoke,\u5076\u5c14\u559d\u70b9\u9152, but doesn't use any illegal drugs. Her height is 160 cm, weight is 57 kg, and her BMI is 22 kg/m2, which is within a healthy range. Her vital signs are all normal: pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 100/72 mm Hg.\n\nOn physical examination, including a digital rectal exam, everything looks normal. She's had some lab tests done: complete blood count and serum electrolytes are all within normal limits. She also had a urease breath test, which came back negative, meaning she doesn't have an active Helicobacter pylori infection. They've also done upper and lower endoscopies, and those didn't show any abnormalities.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient. There are four options: azathioprine, infliximab, lubiprostone, and mesalamine.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on with this patient. Given her symptoms of bloating, abdominal discomfort, and constipation, especially since they're related to stress and improve after bowel movements, it makes me think of irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS. IBS is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder that's characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort, along with changes in bowel habits, like constipation or diarrhea, or sometimes a combination of both.\n\nIn this case, her symptoms seem to be more towards the constipation end of the spectrum, given that she's experiencing constipation and improvement after bowel movements. So, it's likely that she has IBS with constipation, also known as IBS-C.\n\nNow, let's consider each medication option in relation to IBS-C.\n\nStarting with azathioprine: this is an immunosuppressive medication, often used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. It helps to reduce inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract by suppressing the immune system. However, in this patient, the endoscopies didn't show any abnormalities, which makes IBD less likely. Her symptoms are more suggestive of IBS, which is not an inflammatory condition, so azathioprine wouldn't be indicated here.\n\nNext, infliximab: this is another medication used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions, particularly IBD. It's a biologic agent that blocks tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), which is involved in inflammation. Again, since this patient doesn't have any signs of inflammation, infliximab isn't appropriate for her condition.\n\nThen, lubiprostone: this is a medication that's specifically approved for the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in women. It works by activating chloride channels in the intestines, which increases fluid secretion and stimulates intestinal motility, thereby helping to relieve constipation. Given that this patient is a woman with IBS-C, lubiprostone seems like a fitting option.\n\nLastly, mesalamine: this is a medication that's primarily used to treat inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. It helps to reduce inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Again, since this patient doesn't have evidence of inflammation, mesalamine isn't the right choice here.\n\nSo, based on the patient's symptoms and the likely diagnosis of IBS-C, lubiprostone appears to be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy among the given options.\n\nBut just to make sure, I should consider if there are any other medications or approaches that might be better suited. For instance, sometimes, fiber supplements or laxatives are used in IBS-C. However, lubiprostone is a more targeted therapy for IBS-C in women, so it's a reasonable first-line treatment.\n\nAlso, since stress seems to exacerbate her symptoms, stress management techniques, like cognitive-behavioral therapy or relaxation techniques, could be beneficial in conjunction with medication. But the question is specifically asking for pharmacotherapy, so I should stick to that.\n\nIn summary, for this 24-year-old woman with symptoms suggestive of IBS-C, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is lubiprostone.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C.
