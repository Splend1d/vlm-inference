                    "text": "Okay, so I have this question about group decision-making tasks. It says: \"When performing a(n) ________ task, group members select a solution offered by one of the group members as the group\u2019s solution.\" And there are four options: A. compensatory, B. disjunctive, C. conjunctive, D. additive.\n\nI need to figure out which type of task this describes. Let me think about each option one by one.\n\nFirst, compensatory tasks. From what I remember, compensatory tasks are where the group's performance is based on combining all members' contributions in a way that weaker performances can be offset by stronger ones. So, it's like the good and bad cancel each other out to some extent. But in this scenario, the group is choosing one solution from the members, not combining them. So, this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nNext, disjunctive tasks. I think disjunctive tasks are when the group's solution is as good as the best member's solution. So, in this case, if the group picks the best solution offered by any member, that would be their solution. That sounds a bit like what's being described here. The group selects a solution from one of the members, possibly the best one.\n\nThen, conjunctive tasks. I recall that conjunctive tasks are where the group's performance is limited by the weakest link. For example, if everyone has to do something sequentially and the slowest person determines the overall speed. But in this question, it's about selecting a solution from one of the members, not depending on everyone's contribution collectively. So, this doesn't seem to match.\n\nLastly, additive tasks. Additive tasks are probably where the group's solution is the sum of all members' contributions. Like, if each member generates ideas and they're all added together. Again, that's not matching the scenario here, where they're choosing one solution from among those offered.\n\nSo, between the options, disjunctive seems to be the one where the group's solution is based on the best solution provided by any single member. That aligns with selecting a solution offered by one of the group members as the group's solution.\n\nLet me double-check this. In disjunctive tasks, the group's success is determined by the most capable member. So, if the group chooses the best solution from one of its members, that would be their collective solution, which fits the description of a disjunctive task.\n\nCompensatory tasks involve combining elements where weaker parts can be compensated by stronger ones, but it's not about selecting one solution.\n\nConjunctive tasks are about the group's performance being as good as the least capable member, which doesn't match here.\n\nAdditive tasks involve summing up contributions, which isn't about selecting a single solution.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be B. disjunctive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
