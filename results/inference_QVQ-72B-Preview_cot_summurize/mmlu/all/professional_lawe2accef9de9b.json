The sporting goods store said it would deliver the basketballs by that date. On October 10, one of the sporting goods store's employees was moving items in the warehouse and accidentally destroyed a container of basketballs. As a result, the owner of the sporting goods store telephoned the coach on October 11 and said, \"We had an accident in our warehouse yesterday, and as a result we do not have enough basketballs to fill all of our orders. Therefore, I won't be able to deliver your basketballs on October 15. However, I have contacted our supplier to see if they can rush a delivery of basketballs to us. Although I can't promise it, I should be able to deliver the basketballs you ordered by October 20. \" The coach replied, \"No problem. I think I'll be able to get by until then. \" When the coach failed to receive the basketballs on October 20, he sent the following e-mail to the sporting goods store:\"I must have the basketballs no later than October 23. \" The e-mail was received and read the same day by the owner of the sporting goods store.

So, we've got a basketball coach who needs 25 regulation basketballs for the upcoming season, and he needs them by October 15th at the latest. He places an order with a sporting goods store, and they agree to deliver by that date. But then, on October 10th, there's an accident in the store's warehouse, and some basketballs are destroyed. As a result, on October 11th, the store owner calls the coach and says they can't deliver by the original date but hope to get the basketballs to him by October 20th. The coach is okay with that and says he can wait until then. But when October 20th rolls around, the basketballs still haven't arrived. The coach sends an email on that day saying he needs the basketballs no later than October 23rd. The store owner reads the email the same day. Now, the question is, if the store still doesn't deliver by October 23rd, can the coach cancel the contract?\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. First, we need to understand the contract between the coach and the sporting goods store. The coach ordered 25 basketballs and specified that they needed to be delivered by October 15th. The store agreed to this timeline, so that date is part of the contract terms.\n\nThen, due to an accident on October 10th, the store can't meet the original delivery date. They inform the coach on October 11th that they won't be able to deliver by October 15th but hope to deliver by October 20th. The coach agrees to this new timeline.\n\nNow, when October 20th comes around, and the basketballs still haven't been delivered, the coach sends an email saying he must have them no later than October 23rd. The store owner receives and reads this email the same day.\n\nThe question is, if the store fails to deliver by October 23rd, can the coach cancel the contract?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, provided both parties are viewed as being merchants.\n\nB. Yes, provided that the three-day notice afforded the sporting goods store a reasonable time in which to perform.\n\nC. No, because the coach's October 11th statement effectuated a waiver of any condition of timely delivery.\n\nD. No, because the sporting goods store, by its October 11th statement, did not promise to deliver the basketballs by October 20th.\n\nHmm, let's analyze each option.\n\nStarting with option A: Yes, provided both parties are viewed as being merchants.\n\nWell, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) does have different rules for merchants versus non-merchants, but I'm not sure if that directly applies here. The coach is likely not a merchant dealing in basketballs regularly, whereas the sporting goods store is probably a merchant. But I need to think about how that affects the coach's ability to cancel the contract.\n\nMoving on to option B: Yes, provided that the three-day notice afforded the sporting goods store a reasonable time in which to perform.\n\nHere, the coach gave the store until October 23rd to deliver the basketballs, which was three days after his email on October 20th. The question is whether this three-day window is reasonable for the store to perform. If it's reasonable, then failing to deliver within that time might allow the coach to cancel. But if it's not reasonable, maybe the coach can't cancel just yet.\n\nOption C: No, because the coach's October 11th statement effectuated a waiver of any condition of timely delivery.\n\nWait, on October 11th, the coach agreed to the new delivery date of October 20th. By agreeing to this new date, is the coach waiving the original delivery condition? If so, then maybe the store only needs to deliver by October 20th, and any failure after that doesn't allow cancellation.\n\nBut, the coach sent another email on October 20th setting a new deadline of October 23rd. So, does that override the previous agreement?\n\nLastly, option D: No, because the sporting goods store, by its October 11th statement, did not promise to deliver the basketballs by October 20th.\n\nWait, on October 11th, the store owner said he \"hopes\" to deliver by October 20th but can't promise it. So, did the store actually promise to deliver by that date, or was it just an expectation?\n\nI think this is crucial. If the store didn't actually promise to deliver by October 20th, then maybe the coach can't hold them to that date.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully.\n\nInitially, the delivery was due by October 15th. Due to the accident, the store couldn't meet that date and proposed October 20th, but with no firm commitment. The coach agreed to this new date.\n\nWhen October 20th arrives, and no delivery, the coach sets a new deadline of October 23rd.\n\nNow, if the store fails to deliver by October 23rd, can the coach cancel?\n\nI think the key here is whether the delivery date is a condition of the contract or just a warranty.\n\nIf delivery by a certain date is a condition, then failing to deliver by that date allows cancellation. If it's just a warranty, then the buyer can't cancel but can seek damages.\n\nIn this case, the original delivery date was October 15th, which was part of the contract terms. So, it's likely a condition.\n\nBut then, due to the accident, the store couldn't meet that date, and the coach agreed to extend the delivery date to October 20th.\n\nSo, essentially, the coach waived the original delivery date and agreed to the new one.\n\nNow, when October 20th passes without delivery, the coach sets another deadline of October 23rd.\n\nIf the store fails to deliver by October 23rd, and considering that the coach gave them a reasonable extension, then it's likely that the coach can cancel the contract.\n\nBut, option D suggests that the store didn't actually promise to deliver by October 20th; they only said they \"hoped\" to deliver by then.\n\nSo, perhaps the coach can't hold the store to that date since there was no firm promise.\n\nBut, the coach agreed to wait until October 20th based on the store's hope, and when that date passes, the coach sets another deadline.\n\nI think that if the store fails to deliver by October 23rd, the coach can cancel the contract, provided that the three-day notice was reasonable.\n\nOption B seems relevant here.\n\nBut, option C suggests that the coach's agreement to the new delivery date waives the original condition of timely delivery.\n\nHowever, if the store fails to meet the agreed-upon extended delivery date, then the coach should be able to cancel.\n\nI think the correct answer is B: Yes, provided that the three-day notice afforded the sporting goods store a reasonable time in which to perform.\n\nIf the three days is reasonable, then failing to deliver within that time allows cancellation.\n\nBut, I need to think about what \"reasonable time\" means in this context.\n\nThe coach needed the basketballs by November 1st for the season start, so October 23rd might be a reasonable buffer before the actual need date.\n\nAlso, given that the store had already missed one extended deadline, three days might be reasonable to give them one last chance.\n\nTherefore, if the store doesn't deliver by October 23rd, the coach can cancel the contract, provided that three days is a reasonable time.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
