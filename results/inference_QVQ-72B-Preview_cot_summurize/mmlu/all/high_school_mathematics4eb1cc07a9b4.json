                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find the least positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( \\sqrt{18 \\cdot n \\cdot 34} \\) is an integer. Okay, first things first, I should probably simplify the expression under the square root.\n\nSo, \\( 18 \\cdot n \\cdot 34 \\). Let me calculate \\( 18 \\times 34 \\) to make it easier. Hmm, 18 times 30 is 540, and 18 times 4 is 72, so 540 + 72 is 612. So, \\( 18 \\cdot 34 = 612 \\). Now, the expression is \\( \\sqrt{612n} \\).\n\nI need \\( \\sqrt{612n} \\) to be an integer. That means that \\( 612n \\) must be a perfect square. So, my task is to find the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 612n \\) is a perfect square.\n\nTo do that, I should factorize 612 into its prime factors. Let's see, 612 divided by 2 is 306, divided by 2 again is 153. 153 divided by 3 is 51, and 51 divided by 3 is 17. So, the prime factorization of 612 is \\( 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 17 \\).\n\nFor \\( 612n \\) to be a perfect square, all the exponents in its prime factorization need to be even numbers. Currently, the exponent of 17 is 1, which is odd. So, I need to multiply by another 17 to make the exponent of 17 even (specifically, 2). Wait, but I should check the exponents:\n\n- \\( 2^2 \\): even\n\n- \\( 3^2 \\): even\n\n- \\( 17^1 \\): odd\n\nSo, multiplying by another 17 would make it \\( 17^2 \\), which is even. Therefore, \\( n = 17 \\) should suffice.\n\nBut let me check if that's the smallest possible \\( n \\). Is there any other prime factor that needs to be adjusted? Looking at the prime factors, only 17 has an odd exponent. So, multiplying by 17 should make all exponents even.\n\nWait a minute, let's verify this. If \\( n = 17 \\), then \\( 612 \\times 17 = 10404 \\). Let's factorize 10404.\n\n10404 divided by 2 is 5202, divided by 2 again is 2601. 2601 divided by 3 is 867, divided by 3 is 289. 289 is \\( 17^2 \\). So, \\( 10404 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 17^2 \\), which is indeed a perfect square (\\( (2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 17)^2 = 102^2 = 10404 \\)).\n\nSo, \\( \\sqrt{10404} = 102 \\), which is an integer. Therefore, \\( n = 17 \\) works.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option C is 17, but there's also option A, 15, which is smaller. Maybe 15 also works? Let's check.\n\nIf \\( n = 15 \\), then \\( 612 \\times 15 = 9180 \\). Now, factorize 9180.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to see if 9180 is a perfect square. But that seems tedious. Alternatively, maybe I can check if there are any prime factors with odd exponents.\n\nWe know that 612 is \\( 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 17 \\), and \\( n = 15 = 3 \\cdot 5 \\). So, \\( 612 \\times 15 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 17 \\).\n\nHere, the exponents are:\n\n- 2: even\n\n- 3: odd (3)\n\n- 5: odd (1)\n\n- 17: odd (1)\n\nSo, none of these are even except for 2. Therefore, \\( n = 15 \\) does not make \\( 612n \\) a perfect square. So, 15 is not a valid choice.\n\nWhat about option B, \\( n = 10 \\)? Let's check that.\n\n\\( n = 10 = 2 \\cdot 5 \\), so \\( 612 \\times 10 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 17 \\).\n\nExponents:\n\n- 2: odd (3)\n\n- 3: even\n\n- 5: odd (1)\n\n- 17: odd (1)\n\nAgain, multiple odd exponents, so not a perfect square.\n\nOption D is \\( n = 34 \\), which is larger than 17, so that can't be the smallest.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) that makes \\( \\sqrt{18 \\cdot n \\cdot 34} \\) an integer is 17.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]"
