                    "text": "So the problem is about the temperature dropping 11\u00b0F between 6 P.M. and 10 P.M., and it was 84\u00b0F at 10 P.M. I need to write and solve an equation to find the temperature at 6 P.M., which is represented by t.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. The temperature decreased by 11\u00b0F from 6 P.M. to 10 P.M., and at 10 P.M., it's 84\u00b0F. So, if the temperature was higher at 6 P.M., and it dropped by 11\u00b0F to reach 84\u00b0F at 10 P.M., that means that at 6 P.M., the temperature must have been 84\u00b0F plus the 11\u00b0F drop.\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. If the temperature dropped by 11\u00b0F to reach 84\u00b0F, then the temperature at 6 P.M. should have been 84\u00b0F plus 11\u00b0F, which is 95\u00b0F. But let's think about this carefully.\n\nLet me denote the temperature at 6 P.M. as t. Between 6 P.M. and 10 P.M., the temperature dropped by 11\u00b0F, and at 10 P.M., it's 84\u00b0F.\n\nSo, the relationship between t and 84\u00b0F should be that t minus 11\u00b0F equals 84\u00b0F, because the temperature decreased by 11\u00b0F.\n\nSo, t - 11 = 84.\n\nWait, but let's see. If the temperature at 6 P.M. was t, and it dropped by 11\u00b0F to reach 84\u00b0F at 10 P.M., then indeed, t - 11 = 84.\n\nTo solve for t, I would add 11 to both sides of the equation:\n\nt - 11 + 11 = 84 + 11\n\nSo, t = 95\u00b0F.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense. If the temperature was 95\u00b0F at 6 P.M. and it dropped by 11\u00b0F, then at 10 P.M., it should be 95 - 11 = 84\u00b0F, which matches the given information.\n\nSo, the correct equation is t - 11 = 84, and solving for t gives 95\u00b0F.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 84 \u2212 11 = t; 73\u00b0F\n\nB. t \u2212 84 = 11; 95\u00b0F\n\nC. 84 \u2212 t = 11; 73\u00b0F\n\nD. t \u2212 11 = 84; 95\u00b0F\n\nOption D matches the equation I came up with and the temperature I calculated.\n\nBut let's verify if any other options could possibly be correct.\n\nOption A: 84 \u2212 11 = t; 73\u00b0F\n\nThis suggests that the temperature at 6 P.M. was 73\u00b0F, but that doesn't make sense because if the temperature drops by 11\u00b0F to reach 84\u00b0F at 10 P.M., then it must have been higher at 6 P.M., not lower.\n\nOption B: t \u2212 84 = 11; 95\u00b0F\n\nThis equation suggests that the temperature at 6 P.M. minus 84\u00b0F equals 11\u00b0F. So, t - 84 = 11.\n\nSolving for t: t = 84 + 11 = 95\u00b0F.\n\nThis also gives t = 95\u00b0F, but the equation seems to suggest that the temperature at 6 P.M. is 11\u00b0F more than the temperature at 10 P.M., which aligns with the fact that it dropped by 11\u00b0F.\n\nHowever, the equation t - 84 = 11 is mathematically equivalent to t = 84 + 11, which is correct, but it's not directly expressing the relationship between the temperatures at 6 P.M. and 10 P.M. in the same way as option D.\n\nOption C: 84 \u2212 t = 11; 73\u00b0F\n\nThis equation suggests that 84\u00b0F minus the temperature at 6 P.M. equals 11\u00b0F. So, 84 - t = 11.\n\nSolving for t: t = 84 - 11 = 73\u00b0F.\n\nBut this would imply that the temperature at 6 P.M. was 73\u00b0F, which would require the temperature to increase by 11\u00b0F to reach 84\u00b0F at 10 P.M., not decrease.\n\nSince the problem states that the temperature dropped by 11\u00b0F, this option is incorrect.\n\nOption D: t \u2212 11 = 84; 95\u00b0F\n\nThis is the equation I originally came up with, and it correctly represents the situation where the temperature at 6 P.M. minus 11\u00b0F equals the temperature at 10 P.M.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D: t \u2212 11 = 84; 95\u00b0F.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the problem again.\n\nThe temperature dropped 11\u00b0F between 6 P.M. and 10 P.M., and it was 84\u00b0F at 10 P.M.\n\nSo, the temperature at 6 P.M. was higher by 11\u00b0F than at 10 P.M.\n\nTherefore, t = 84 + 11 = 95\u00b0F.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\nOption B also leads to t = 95\u00b0F, but the equation t - 84 = 11 is less straightforward in representing the temperature change between the two times.\n\nIt's more natural to express the relationship as t - 11 = 84, which directly translates to \"the temperature at 6 P.M. minus 11\u00b0F equals the temperature at 10 P.M.\"\n\nHence, option D is the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
