                    "text": "Let's see here. I'm trying to figure out what kind of reinforcement schedule the Yellow Brick Road ice cream parlor is using with their over-the-rainbow card. The way it works is that every time you buy an ice cream, you get a stamp on your card. And after you've bought ten items, you get your next item for free. So, I need to see which of these options\u2014variable-ratio, variable-interval, fixed-ratio, or fixed-interval\u2014this scenario best fits.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what each type of reinforcement schedule is about. Starting with ratio schedules: these are schedules where a response is reinforced after a certain number of responses have been made. The \"ratio\" refers to the number of responses required for reinforcement. Now, within ratio schedules, there are fixed-ratio and variable-ratio types.\n\nFixed-ratio schedules involve giving reinforcement after a specific, set number of responses. For example, if it's a fixed-ratio of 5, you get a reward after every 5 responses. Variable-ratio schedules, on the other hand, involve reinforcing after an average number of responses, but the exact number varies unpredictably.\n\nInterval schedules, on the other hand, are based on time rather than the number of responses. Here, reinforcement is given for the first response that occurs after a specified time has passed. Similarly, there are fixed-interval and variable-interval schedules. In fixed-interval schedules, the time between reinforcements is consistent, while in variable-interval schedules, the time varies.\n\nGiven that, let's think about the ice cream parlor's program. You get a stamp for every ice cream you buy, and after ten stamps, you get a free ice cream. So, it's based on the number of purchases (responses) you make. Specifically, every tenth purchase is rewarded with a free item.\n\nThis sounds like a ratio schedule because it's based on the number of responses, not the time between responses. Now, between fixed-ratio and variable-ratio, which one fits better?\n\nIn a fixed-ratio schedule, the number of responses required for reinforcement is constant. In this case, it's every tenth purchase. So, it's a fixed number: ten purchases for one free item.\n\nIn a variable-ratio schedule, the number of responses required varies, though there's an average. But in this scenario, it's specified that it's after ten purchases, so it's not varying; it's consistently every tenth purchase.\n\nTherefore, this should be a fixed-ratio schedule.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's more to it. Let's consider if there could be any variability in the number of purchases required for the reward.\n\nSuppose sometimes they might give a free item after nine purchases, or eleven, just to vary it. But the problem says, \"Once you purchase ten items, you get your next item free.\" It doesn't mention any variation in the number of purchases required for the free item. So, based on the information given, it seems like it's consistently after ten purchases.\n\nSo, option C: Fixed-ratio seems to be the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let's quickly consider what the other options would look like in this context.\n\nOption A: Variable-ratio. If this were the case, the number of purchases required for a free item would vary, perhaps averaging around ten but not being exactly ten each time. But that's not what's described here.\n\nOption B: Variable-interval. This would involve reinforcing a response after varying time periods, which doesn't align with the purchase-based reward system described.\n\nOption D: Fixed-interval. This would involve reinforcing a response after a fixed period of time has passed, which again doesn't match the purchase-based reward system.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate choice is C: Fixed-ratio.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
