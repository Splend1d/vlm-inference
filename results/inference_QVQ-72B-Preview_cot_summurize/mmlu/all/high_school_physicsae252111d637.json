                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a battery and some resistors in a circuit. The problem says there's an ideal battery with a constant voltage V supplying current to a circuit that has a total resistance R. Then it asks what happens to the total power dissipated by the circuit if R is doubled. The options are: it will double, quadruple, be halved, or remain the same.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall some basic electric circuit concepts. I know that in a circuit with a battery and resistors, the battery provides a voltage V, and the current flowing through the circuit depends on the total resistance R. The relationship between voltage, current, and resistance is given by Ohm's law, which states that V = IR, where I is the current.\n\nSo, if the voltage V is constant and the resistance R is doubled, what happens to the current? Well, from Ohm's law, if R doubles, and V stays the same, then I should halve. So, I = V/R, and if R becomes 2R, then I becomes V/(2R) = I/2. So, the current is halved.\n\nBut the question is about the power dissipated by the circuit. Power is the rate at which energy is dissipated, and in a circuit, the total power dissipated in the resistors is given by P = VI, where V is the voltage and I is the current.\n\nSo, if V is constant and I is halved when R is doubled, then P = V * (I/2) = (1/2) * V * I. That means the power is halved.\n\nWait a minute, but is there another way to look at this? Maybe using the formula P = V^2 / R? Yeah, since P = V^2 / R, if R is doubled to 2R, then P = V^2 / (2R), which is (1/2) * (V^2 / R). So, again, the power is halved.\n\nHmm, both approaches give me the same answer, which is reassuring. So, according to this, the total power dissipated by the circuit is halved when the resistance is doubled.\n\nLet me just double-check if there are any other factors I should consider. The problem mentions an ideal battery, which means no internal resistance, so the voltage remains constant regardless of the current. That's good.\n\nIs there any other component in the circuit that might affect this? The problem says \"a circuit that has total resistance R,\" so I think it's safe to assume that the entire circuit can be modeled as a single resistor with resistance R.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using power per unit resistance. But since it's the total power we're after, maybe that's not necessary.\n\nLet me consider the units to make sure I'm not missing something. Power is in watts, voltage in volts, and resistance in ohms. The relationships I've used, P = VI and P = V^2 / R, are standard and dimensionally consistent.\n\nSo, if R doubles, P becomes half, whether from P = VI with I halved, or P = V^2 / R with R doubled.\n\nI think I've covered all the possible angles here, and both methods point to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the total power dissipated by the circuit will be halved when the resistance is doubled.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. It will be halved.}} \\]"
