                    "text": "So I'm trying to remember this model about group development that Tuckman came up with. I think it's called Tuckman's stages of group development or something like that. There are four main stages, right? Forming, storming, norming, and performing. I need to match the term Tuckman uses for reaching consensus as a group with the correct stage. The options are storming, performing, forming, or norming. Hmm, let me think about each one.\n\nFirst, forming. That's usually the initial stage where the group is just starting out. People are getting to know each other, figuring out the group's purpose, and establishing basic norms. It's more about orientation and building relationships, not really about reaching consensus on anything substantial yet. So, probably not forming.\n\nNext, storming. I remember this stage can be a bit rocky. It's where conflicts and disagreements start to surface as group members assert their own ideas and opinions. It's a necessary phase for the group to work through differences, but it's not typically where consensus is reached. In fact, it's more about dealing with disagreements and power struggles. So, maybe not storming.\n\nThen there's norming. This sounds more promising. After the storming phase, the group starts to resolve their differences and establish agreed-upon standards and norms. People begin to work together more cooperatively, and a sense of cohesion starts to form. Consensus building seems to happen here as the group finds common ground and agrees on how to proceed. So, perhaps norming is the answer.\n\nLastly, performing. This is the stage where the group is functioning smoothly and productively. Roles are clear, relationships are strong, and the group is focused on achieving its goals. Consensus might already have been reached in the norming stage, so in performing, it's more about executing the plans and working together efficiently. So, probably not performing.\n\nLet me double-check. Forming is the beginning, storming is when conflicts arise, norming is when agreements are reached and consensus is built, and performing is when the group is operating at its best, using the consensus they've reached. So, yes, norming seems to be the stage where reaching consensus as a group occurs.\n\nWait a minute, is there a fifth stage? I think sometimes people mention a fifth stage called adjourning or ending, but I think that's an addition Tuckman made later. In the original model, there are four stages: forming, storming, norming, and performing. So, based on that, norming is the stage where consensus is reached.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider the definitions again. Forming is the start, storming is the conflict phase, norming is where norms are established and consensus is reached, and performing is the high-performance phase. So, again, norming is where consensus happens.\n\nI don't think it's forming because that's just the initial stage of getting acquainted. Storming is about conflict and disagreement, not agreement. Performing is after consensus has been reached, when the group is already working effectively together. So, norming makes the most sense.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose a group is formed to plan an event. In forming, they introduce themselves and discuss the event's purpose. In storming, they might disagree on the theme, budget, or venue. In norming, they discuss their differences, find compromises, and agree on the details. In performing, they execute the plan, having already reached consensus in norming. So, yes, consensus is reached in norming.\n\nI think I've got it. The term Tuckman uses for reaching consensus as a group is norming.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Norming}} \\]"
