                    "text": "So I have this problem here. Fei Yen's dog eats 8 ounces of dog food each day. Fei Yen bought a 28-pound bag of dog food, and I need to figure out how many 8-ounce servings are in that 28-pound bag. The options are 14, 56, 224, or 448 servings.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the units here. There are 16 ounces in a pound. So, if the bag is 28 pounds, that means there are 28 times 16 ounces in the whole bag. Let me calculate that.\n\n28 multiplied by 16 is 448 ounces. So, there are 448 ounces in the 28-pound bag.\n\nNow, the dog eats 8 ounces each day. So, to find out how many 8-ounce servings are in 448 ounces, I need to divide 448 by 8.\n\n448 divided by 8 equals 56.\n\nSo, there are 56 servings of 8 ounces in a 28-pound bag of dog food.\n\nLet me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with 28 pounds, and since 1 pound is 16 ounces, then 28 pounds is indeed 28 times 16, which is 448 ounces.\n\nThen, dividing that total ounces by the serving size of 8 ounces per serving, 448 divided by 8, which is 56 servings.\n\nThat seems correct to me. So, the answer should be B. 56.\n\nI think that's it. No further calculations needed here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{56} \\]"
