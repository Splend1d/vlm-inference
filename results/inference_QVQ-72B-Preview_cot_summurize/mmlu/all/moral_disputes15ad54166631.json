                    "text": " So I'm trying to understand this case that Frances Kamm talks about regarding a scientist who's working on a cure for congenital blindness. The scientist is motivated solely by a bad desire for mastery. And Kamm uses this to suggest something about the permissibility of actions based on the desires that motivate them. Let me see what options are given.\n\nOption A says that sometimes an action can be permissible even if it's motivated by a bad desire. Option B says that all actions motivated by bad desires are impermissible. Option C says that the desire for mastery is not, as Sandel argues, a bad desire. And Option D says that sometimes the only way to cure a disease is through selfish desires.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Kamm is trying to argue with this case. She's using it to suggest something about the relationship between the morality of an action and the desires that motivate it. The scientist is motivated by a bad desire for mastery, but the action itself\u2014finding a cure for congenital blindness\u2014is seemingly a good thing.\n\nSo, if the desire is bad but the action is good, what does that imply about the permissibility of the action based on the motive?\n\nWell, it seems like Kamm is using this to support the idea that an action can be permissible even if it's motivated by a bad desire. Because, even though the scientist has a bad desire, the action of finding a cure is still a good thing and should be permissible.\n\nLet me think about that. If someone does something good but for a bad reason, does that make the action impermissible? Or is the action still permissible despite the bad motive?\n\nI think most people would say that the action is still permissible because the outcome is good, regardless of the motive. So, Option A seems to align with this view.\n\nOption B says that all actions motivated by bad desires are impermissible. But in this case, even though the desire is bad, the action is good. So, according to Kamm, it seems like Option B is being contradicted by the case.\n\nOption C says that the desire for mastery is not, as Sandel argues, a bad desire. But Kamm is assuming that the desire for mastery is bad, as Sandel argues, and using that as a premise to make a point about the permissibility of actions motivated by bad desires.\n\nSo, Option C seems to be contrary to Kamm's assumption in the case.\n\nOption D says that sometimes the only way to cure a disease is through selfish desires. That seems like a stretch from the case presented. The case doesn't say that it's the only way; it's just using this as an example to make a point about permissibility and motives.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like Kamm is suggesting that sometimes an action can be permissible even if it's motivated by a bad desire. Which would be Option A.\n\nWait, but the question says \"to suggest that,\" meaning that Kamm is using this case to support that particular option.\n\nLet me double-check. If the scientist is motivated by a bad desire for mastery, but the action of finding a cure is good, then it shows that a good action can be motivated by a bad desire and still be permissible.\n\nSo, yes, that aligns with Option A: sometimes an action can be permissible even if it's motivated by a bad desire.\n\nOption B is the opposite: all actions motivated by bad desires are impermissible. That doesn't seem to align with the case.\n\nOption C is about whether the desire for mastery is bad or not, which is not the main point Kamm is making here. She's assuming it's bad, as Sandel argues, to make her point about permissibility.\n\nOption D is about the only way to cure a disease being through selfish desires, which isn't directly supported by the case. It's just one example of a scientist motivated by a bad desire achieving a good outcome.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is Option A: sometimes an action can be permissible even if it is motivated by a bad desire.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
