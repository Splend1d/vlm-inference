                    "text": "Alright, I'm trying to figure out this question about Singer's suggestion for a \"bolder\" strategy regarding genetic engineering. The premise is that a global ban on genetic engineering beyond eliminating obvious defects wouldn't be effective. So, the question is asking what alternative strategy Singer proposes in that case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Genetic engineering is a complex topic with ethical implications. A global ban seems like a straightforward approach to regulate it, but if it's not effective, maybe because countries or individuals might not comply, then there needs to be a stronger measure.\n\nOption A suggests creating a world military to enforce the ban with greater strength. That sounds pretty drastic. A world military would involve a lot of political and practical challenges. Plus, it seems like overkill for enforcing a ban on genetic engineering. Maybe there's a less extreme approach.\n\nOption B proposes requiring genetic engineering for every newborn child. This is interesting. Instead of\u7981\u6b62 it, make it mandatory for everyone. This could ensure that no one has an unfair advantage by enhancing their children beyond what's considered normal. But it also raises ethical questions about interfering with parental choice and the natural course of human diversity.\n\nOption C mentions using a lottery system so everyone gets a fair chance at the benefits of genetic engineering. This seems like a way to distribute the benefits equitably, perhaps to prevent only the wealthy from accessing genetic enhancements. It's a more egalitarian approach, but it might not address the underlying issues of safety and ethics in genetic engineering.\n\nLastly, option D is \"none of the above,\" which might imply that Singer proposes something else not listed here.\n\nGiven that the question specifies a \"bolder\" strategy, I need to think about which of these options is more ambitious or far-reaching compared to a simple ban.\n\nOption A is certainly bold, but it seems too extreme and perhaps impractical. Plus, enforcing a ban with a military might not address the root issues of why the ban is ineffective in the first place.\n\nOption B, making genetic engineering mandatory for all, is a very different approach. It's proactive rather than reactive. This could level the playing field by ensuring that everyone gets the same genetic enhancements, potentially eliminating social inequalities that might arise from voluntary genetic engineering.\n\nOption C, a lottery system, is also bold but perhaps less comprehensive. It aims for fairness in access but might not prevent those who don't get selected from seeking genetic enhancements through other means.\n\nConsidering these points, option B seems like the most comprehensive and ambitious strategy. Requiring genetic engineering for every newborn child would ensure universal access and potentially eliminate the need for a ban altogether, as everyone would be on an equal footing.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether this aligns with Singer's views. I recall that Singer is known for his ethical positions, particularly in bioethics. He might advocate for approaches that prioritize equality and prevent harm.\n\nIf a ban is ineffective, perhaps because some entities will always find ways to circumvent it, then making genetic engineering mandatory could be seen as a way to control and regulate it more effectively. It could also prevent the creation of a genetic underclass if only certain people could access enhancements.\n\nOn the other hand, this approach raises significant ethical concerns about individual freedom and the definition of what constitutes a \"defect.\" Who decides what enhancements are allowed or required? Could this lead to eugenics-like policies?\n\nDespite these concerns, if the goal is to prevent unequal access and potential harm from unregulated genetic engineering, a mandatory approach might be seen as a bolder and more decisive strategy.\n\nComparatively, a lottery system (option C) might be seen as a compromise, attempting to balance access with fairness, but it might not be as effective in preventing the issues that a ban is intended to address.\n\nTherefore, based on the options provided and the idea of a \"bolder\" strategy, I would conclude that Singer suggests requiring genetic engineering for every newborn child (option B).\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider whether there might be another answer.\n\nIf I choose \"none of the above\" (option D), I would need to consider what else Singer might propose. Perhaps he suggests a different approach, like international regulations coupled with incentives for compliance, or some form of global governance specifically tailored to genetic engineering.\n\nHowever, based on the options given, and considering the term \"bolder\" implies a more aggressive or innovative approach, option B seems the most fitting.\n\nAdditionally, the idea of making genetic engineering mandatory for all could be seen as a way to democratize access and prevent the ethical dilemmas that arise from unequal distribution.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is option B: requiring genetic engineering for every newborn child.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
