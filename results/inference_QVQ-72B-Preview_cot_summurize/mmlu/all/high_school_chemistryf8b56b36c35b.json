                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a metal reacting with hydrochloric acid (HCl) to produce hydrogen gas. The problem gives me that 0.0623 grams of the metal produces 28.3 milliliters of hydrogen at STP, and I need to find out the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid. The options are A. 98.6 g, B. 493 g, C. 24.7 g, and D. 49.3 g.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the reaction happening here. When a metal reacts with HCl, it's typically a single displacement reaction where the metal displaces hydrogen from the acid, producing a salt of the metal and hydrogen gas. The general equation for this type of reaction is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{metal} + 2\\text{HCl} \\rightarrow \\text{metal chloride} + \\text{H}_2\n\\]\n\nBut I need to be careful here. Not all metals react with HCl in a 1:2 ratio. For example, metals like magnesium and aluminum have different stoichiometries because they can form ions with charges higher than +1. So, maybe the reaction isn't always a 1:2 ratio. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the oxidation state of the metal.\n\nLet me assume that the metal is a Group 1 or Group 2 metal, which commonly form +1 and +2 ions, respectively. So, for a Group 1 metal (like Na or K):\n\n\\[\n2\\text{metal} + 2\\text{HCl} \\rightarrow 2\\text{metal chloride} + \\text{H}_2\n\\]\n\nFor a Group 2 metal (like Mg or Ca):\n\n\\[\n\\text{metal} + 2\\text{HCl} \\rightarrow \\text{metal chloride} + \\text{H}_2\n\\]\n\nSo, in both cases, hydrogen gas is produced, but the stoichiometry depends on the metal's oxidation state.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify what metal it is, so I need to find a general approach that doesn't depend on knowing the exact metal.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can think in terms of the moles of metal reacting with moles of HCl to produce moles of hydrogen gas, and use the volume of hydrogen gas at STP to find the moles of hydrogen, and from there, find the moles of metal and HCl.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many moles of hydrogen gas are produced.\n\nAt STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure), 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters. But wait, the volume given is in milliliters, so I need to convert 28.3 mL to liters, which is 0.0283 L.\n\nSo, the number of moles of hydrogen gas produced is:\n\n\\[\nn_{\\text{H}_2} = \\frac{0.0283 \\text{ L}}{22.4 \\text{ L/mol}} = \\frac{0.0283}{22.4} \\text{ moles}\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\[\nn_{\\text{H}_2} = \\frac{0.0283}{22.4} \\approx 0.00126 \\text{ moles}\n\\]\n\nSo, 0.00126 moles of hydrogen gas are produced from 0.0623 grams of metal.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many moles of metal correspond to 0.0623 grams.\n\nIf I know the molar mass of the metal, I can find the moles. But I don't know the molar mass yet. Maybe I can set up a ratio.\n\nLet me denote the molar mass of the metal as M (in g/mol). Then, the number of moles of metal is:\n\n\\[\nn_{\\text{metal}} = \\frac{0.0623 \\text{ g}}{M \\text{ g/mol}}\n\\]\n\nNow, from the reaction, the stoichiometry between metal and hydrogen depends on the metal's oxidation state. Let's assume the metal has an oxidation state of +n, where n can be 1 or 2 or something else.\n\nThe general reaction would be:\n\n\\[\nn\\text{metal} + 2n\\text{HCl} \\rightarrow n\\text{metal chloride} + n\\text{H}_2\n\\]\n\nWait, that might not be the best way to approach it. Maybe I should think in terms of the number of moles of HCl that react with one mole of metal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of equivalent weights. In acid-base reactions, the equivalent weight of an acid is the mass of acid that can combine with one mole of hydrogen ions (H\u207a). Similarly, for the metal, the equivalent weight would be the mass that can react with one mole of H\u207a ions.\n\nBut maybe that's complicating things. Let's try to think differently.\n\nThe problem asks for the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid. So, perhaps I need to find the mass of metal that reacts with 1 mole of HCl.\n\nGiven that, I need to find the relationship between the moles of metal and the moles of HCl in the reaction.\n\nFrom the reaction:\n\n\\[\n\\text{metal} + 2\\text{HCl} \\rightarrow \\text{metal chloride} + \\text{H}_2\n\\]\n\nAssuming the metal is divalent, like magnesium, then 1 mole of metal reacts with 2 moles of HCl to produce 1 mole of hydrogen gas.\n\nAlternatively, if the metal is monovalent, like sodium, then 2 moles of metal react with 2 moles of HCl to produce 1 mole of hydrogen gas.\n\nSo, in both cases, 2 moles of HCl produce 1 mole of hydrogen gas.\n\nWait, but in the first case, for a divalent metal, it's 2 moles of HCl per mole of metal, and in the second case, for a monovalent metal, it's 2 moles of HCl per 2 moles of metal.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should consider the general case.\n\nLet me assume that for every mole of metal, x moles of HCl are required. Then, the mass of metal that reacts with 1 mole of HCl would be (molar mass of metal)/x.\n\nBut I don't know x, so that doesn't help much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the moles of hydrogen gas produced to find the moles of metal and then relate that to the moles of HCl.\n\nFrom the reaction, moles of HCl reacted with moles of metal to produce moles of H\u2082.\n\nGiven that, I can set up a ratio.\n\nLet me consider the general case where the metal has an oxidation state of +n.\n\nThen, the balanced equation would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{metal} + n\\text{HCl} \\rightarrow \\text{metal chloride} + \\frac{n}{2}\\text{H}_2\n\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's think again.\n\nActually, for an n-valent metal, the reaction with HCl would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{metal} + 2\\text{HCl} \\rightarrow \\text{metal chloride} + \\text{H}_2\n\\]\n\nRegardless of the oxidation state, because HCl is providing H\u207a ions, and the metal is reducing them to H\u2082.\n\nWait, but in reality, for a divalent metal like magnesium:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mg} + 2\\text{HCl} \\rightarrow \\text{MgCl}_2 + \\text{H}_2\n\\]\n\nFor a monovalent metal like sodium:\n\n\\[\n2\\text{Na} + 2\\text{HCl} \\rightarrow 2\\text{NaCl} + \\text{H}_2\n\\]\n\nSo, in both cases, 2 moles of HCl produce 1 mole of H\u2082, but the metal to HCl ratio differs based on the metal's oxidation state.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to consider that for every mole of metal, a certain number of moles of HCl are consumed, and that depends on the metal's oxidation state.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the metal, maybe I can find a general relationship.\n\nLet me denote the oxidation state of the metal as n. Then, the balanced equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{metal} + n\\text{HCl} \\rightarrow \\text{metal chloride} + \\frac{n}{2}\\text{H}_2\n\\]\n\nBut actually, that doesn't make sense because in reality, for n-valent metals, it's always:\n\n\\[\n\\text{metal} + 2\\text{HCl} \\rightarrow \\text{metal chloride} + \\text{H}_2\n\\]\n\nWait, but metal chloride could be metal chloride with varying charges.\n\nActually, no. For example, MgCl\u2082 is magnesium chloride, which corresponds to Mg\u00b2\u207a and Cl\u207b, so it's Mg + 2HCl \u2192 MgCl\u2082 + H\u2082.\n\nSimilarly, FeCl\u2082 is iron(II) chloride, Fe + 2HCl \u2192 FeCl\u2082 + H\u2082.\n\nAnd for iron(III), it's Fe + 3HCl \u2192 FeCl\u2083 + 1.5 H\u2082, but that's not common because HCl is a strong acid and doesn't typically oxidize metals beyond certain points.\n\nMaybe I should stick with the assumption that for most metals, it's 2 moles of HCl per mole of metal.\n\nBut in the case of iron, it can be variable, forming Fe\u00b2\u207a or Fe\u00b3\u207a.\n\nHowever, to simplify, perhaps I can assume that for the metal in question, it's reacting with 2 moles of HCl per mole of metal.\n\nSo, assuming that, then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{metal} + 2\\text{HCl} \\rightarrow \\text{metal chloride} + \\text{H}_2\n\\]\n\nThen, 1 mole of metal reacts with 2 moles of HCl to produce 1 mole of H\u2082.\n\nGiven that, if I have 0.00126 moles of H\u2082 produced from 0.0623 grams of metal, then the moles of metal reacted would be the same, 0.00126 moles, assuming a 1:1 ratio between metal and H\u2082.\n\nWait, but according to the reaction, it's 1:1 between metal and H\u2082.\n\nSo, if 0.00126 moles of H\u2082 are produced, then 0.00126 moles of metal reacted.\n\nTherefore, the molar mass of the metal is:\n\n\\[\nM = \\frac{0.0623 \\text{ g}}{0.00126 \\text{ mol}} \\approx 49.5 \\text{ g/mol}\n\\]\n\nSo, the molar mass of the metal is approximately 49.5 g/mol.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid.\n\nFrom the reaction, 1 mole of metal reacts with 2 moles of HCl.\n\nTherefore, the mass of metal that reacts with 1 mole of HCl is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{mass} = \\frac{1 \\text{ mol metal}}{2 \\text{ mol HCl}} \\times M\n\\]\n\nSo, plugging in M = 49.5 g/mol:\n\n\\[\n\\text{mass} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 49.5 \\text{ g} = 24.75 \\text{ g}\n\\]\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 24.7 g is very close to this calculation.\n\nBut wait, let me check my assumptions.\n\nI assumed that the reaction is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{metal} + 2\\text{HCl} \\rightarrow \\text{metal chloride} + \\text{H}_2\n\\]\n\nBut what if the metal has a higher oxidation state, like +3?\n\nIn that case, the reaction would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{metal} + 3\\text{HCl} \\rightarrow \\text{metal chloride} + \\frac{3}{2}\\text{H}_2\n\\]\n\nBut that seems unlikely because typically, hydrogen gas is produced in stoichiometric ratios based on the metal's oxidation state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the oxidation number of the metal.\n\nLet me denote the oxidation number of the metal as n.\n\nThen, the balanced equation would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{metal} + n\\text{HCl} \\rightarrow \\text{metal chloride} + \\frac{n}{2}\\text{H}_2\n\\]\n\nBut in reality, for most metals, it's 2 moles of HCl per mole of metal.\n\nWait, but for iron, which can have +2 or +3 oxidation states, it's different.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the general case.\n\nLet me consider that for every mole of metal, x moles of HCl are consumed, and y moles of H\u2082 are produced.\n\nGiven that, I can relate the moles of metal to the moles of HCl and the moles of H\u2082.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should stick with the initial assumption that for most metals, it's 2 moles of HCl per mole of metal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this problem using the concept of equivalent weights.\n\nIn acid-base reactions, the equivalent weight of an acid is the mass that can combine with one mole of H\u207a ions.\n\nSimilarly, for the metal, the equivalent weight would be the mass that can react with one mole of H\u207a ions.\n\nGiven that, if I can find the equivalent weight of the metal, that would be the answer.\n\nThe equivalent weight is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{equivalent weight} = \\frac{\\text{molar mass}}{\\text{valence}}\n\\]\n\nWhere valence is the oxidation state of the metal.\n\nBut again, I don't know the oxidation state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the moles of H\u2082 produced to find the moles of metal, and then find the molar mass of the metal, and from there, find the mass that reacts with one mole of HCl.\n\nLet me try that again.\n\nFrom earlier, I have:\n\n\\[\nn_{\\text{H}_2} = 0.00126 \\text{ moles}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the reaction is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{metal} + 2\\text{HCl} \\rightarrow \\text{metal chloride} + \\text{H}_2\n\\]\n\nThen, moles of metal = moles of H\u2082 = 0.00126 moles.\n\nMoles of HCl = 2 \u00d7 moles of metal = 2 \u00d7 0.00126 = 0.00252 moles.\n\nGiven that, the mass of metal that reacts with 0.00252 moles of HCl is 0.0623 grams.\n\nTherefore, the mass of metal that reacts with 1 mole of HCl is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{mass} = \\frac{0.0623 \\text{ g}}{0.00252 \\text{ mol}} \\times 1 \\text{ mol} \\approx 24.7 \\text{ g}\n\\]\n\nThis matches option C. 24.7 g.\n\nBut let me double-check if my assumption about the reaction stoichiometry is correct.\n\nSuppose the metal is monovalent, like sodium:\n\n\\[\n2\\text{Na} + 2\\text{HCl} \\rightarrow 2\\text{NaCl} + \\text{H}_2\n\\]\n\nIn this case, 2 moles of Na react with 2 moles of HCl to produce 1 mole of H\u2082.\n\nSo, moles of Na = 2 \u00d7 moles of H\u2082.\n\nGiven that, if I have 0.00126 moles of H\u2082, then moles of Na = 2 \u00d7 0.00126 = 0.00252 moles.\n\nThen, mass of Na = 0.00252 moles \u00d7 molar mass of Na.\n\nGiven that the molar mass of Na is approximately 22.99 g/mol, mass of Na = 0.00252 \u00d7 22.99 \u2248 0.0583 g, which is less than 0.0623 g given in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, if the metal is divalent, like magnesium:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mg} + 2\\text{HCl} \\rightarrow \\text{MgCl}_2 + \\text{H}_2\n\\]\n\nThen, moles of Mg = moles of H\u2082 = 0.00126 moles.\n\nMass of Mg = 0.00126 moles \u00d7 24.31 g/mol \u2248 0.0306 g, which is much less than 0.0623 g.\n\nWait, this suggests that my initial assumption might be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the metal has a higher molar mass.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is not following the typical stoichiometry.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nGiven that 0.0623 grams of metal produces 0.00126 moles of H\u2082 at STP.\n\nI can find the molar mass of the metal based on this information.\n\nAssuming that for every mole of metal, x moles of H\u2082 are produced.\n\nThen, moles of metal = moles of H\u2082 \u00d7 (1/x)\n\nGiven that, molar mass of metal = (mass of metal) / (moles of metal) = 0.0623 g / (0.00126 mol / x)\n\nBut without knowing x, I can't proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the ratio of moles of metal to moles of H\u2082.\n\nIf I assume that the reaction produces one mole of H\u2082 per mole of metal, then moles of metal = moles of H\u2082 = 0.00126 mol, and molar mass = 0.0623 g / 0.00126 mol \u2248 49.5 g/mol.\n\nBut as I saw earlier, for sodium, molar mass is 22.99 g/mol, and for magnesium, 24.31 g/mol, both less than 49.5 g/mol.\n\nAlternatively, if the metal is aluminum, which is trivalent:\n\n\\[\n2\\text{Al} + 6\\text{HCl} \\rightarrow 2\\text"
