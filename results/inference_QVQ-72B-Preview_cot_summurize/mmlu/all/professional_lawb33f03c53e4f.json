                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out which option the court will most likely allow in this case of breach of covenant against encumbrances. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nSo, a landowner sold 50 acres of his orchard to a farmer. The deed included several covenants: seisin, right to convey, and against encumbrances. Now, at the time of the sale, there was an outstanding mortgage on the property. The farmer took possession but was then threatened with foreclosure. So, the farmer paid off the mortgage, including interest, to prevent foreclosure. Now, the farmer is suing the original landowner for breach of the covenant against encumbrances.\n\nOkay, so the covenant against encumbrances generally means that the seller is promising that the property being sold is free from any liens, mortgages, or other encumbrances that might affect the buyer's use or ownership of the property. In this case, there was an outstanding mortgage, which is definitely an encumbrance, so the seller breached that covenant by conveying the property with an existing mortgage.\n\nNow, the farmer had to pay off that mortgage to prevent foreclosure, and now he's seeking recovery from the original landowner for this breach. The question is, how much can the farmer recover? The options are:\n\nA. Recovery for the amount in principal and interest thereon from the time of the mortgage payment.\n\nB. Recovery for only the principal that the farmer paid on the mortgage.\n\nC. Recovery for the measure of value between the value of the land with and without such an encumbrance.\n\nD. No recovery.\n\nHmm, let's think about this.\n\nFirst, the farmer had to pay both the principal and the interest to satisfy the mortgage. The mortgage was an encumbrance that the seller was supposed to have removed before selling the property. Since the seller didn't do that, and the farmer had to pay it off, it seems logical that the farmer should be able to recover those costs from the seller.\n\nBut should it be just the principal, or should it include the interest as well?\n\nWell, the interest paid is also a direct result of the encumbrance. The farmer had to pay interest on the mortgage because of the seller's failure to disclose or remove the encumbrance. So, it seems fair that the farmer should be able to recover both the principal and the interest.\n\nOption A suggests recovery for the amount in principal and interest thereon from the time of the mortgage payment. That sounds comprehensive.\n\nOption B is only for the principal, which might not fully compensate the farmer for the actual loss incurred.\n\nOption C is about the difference in value between the land with and without the encumbrance. Hmm, that seems a bit vague. If the farmer had to pay off the mortgage to clear the title, the value of the land should be equivalent to the purchase price minus the amount paid to clear the encumbrance. But I'm not sure if that's the most appropriate measure in this scenario.\n\nOption D suggests no recovery, which doesn't seem right because there was clearly a breach of the covenant against encumbrances.\n\nI think the most appropriate answer is Option A: recovery for the amount in principal and interest from the time of the mortgage payment. This would fully compensate the farmer for the expenses incurred due to the seller's breach of covenant.\n\nBut let me double-check. In contract law, when there's a breach of covenant, the non-breaching party is entitled to be put in the position they would have been in had the covenant not been breached. So, the farmer should be reimbursed for the amount they had to pay to clear the title, which includes both the principal and the interest.\n\nAdditionally, in property law, when a covenant against encumbrances is breached, the buyer can seek damages for any losses suffered as a result of the encumbrance, which in this case includes both the principal and the interest paid.\n\nTherefore, the court will most likely allow recovery for the amount in principal and interest thereon from the time of the mortgage payment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
