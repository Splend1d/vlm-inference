Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that program documentation should not be changed after it's first written. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. I think documentation should be updated as the program evolves, right? If you make changes to the code, the documentation should reflect those changes to stay accurate. So, probably A is not correct.\n\nOption B says that program documentation is only needed for programs in development and not needed after a program is completed. That seems off to me too. Even after a program is finished, documentation is still important for maintenance, troubleshooting, and for new team members who might need to understand how the program works. So, I don't think B is correct.\n\nOption C says that program documentation is useful when programmers collaborate but not when a programmer works individually on a project. While it's true that documentation is especially helpful in collaborative environments where multiple people need to understand each other's code, it's still beneficial even for individual projects. If you come back to your code after a long time, having good documentation can help you remember what you were doing. So, probably C is not the right answer.\n\nThat leaves Option D: Program documentation is useful during initial program development and also when modifications are made to existing programs. This seems to make sense. Documentation is crucial when you're first building the program to outline its structure, functionality, and design decisions. And when you need to make changes or additions to the program later, having up-to-date documentation can help ensure that those modifications are done correctly and don't introduce errors. Also, it's helpful for other developers who might work on the program in the future.\n\nYeah, I think D is the correct answer. Let me just double-check. Documentation is indeed important both during development and when maintaining or modifying existing code. It provides context, explains the purpose of code sections, and can prevent confusion or mistakes when changes are being made.\n\nSo, the true statement about program documentation is Option D: Program documentation is useful during initial program development and also when modifications are made to existing programs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
