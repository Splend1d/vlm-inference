                    "text": " So I'm trying to understand this question about Norcross's argument regarding moral relevance in the context of Fred's behavior and the behavior of consumers of factory-raised meat. The question is asking which potentially morally relevant difference between these two behaviors Norcross doesn't discuss. The options are:\n\nA. Fred's behavior involves the suffering of puppies, whereas the behavior of meat-eaters \"merely\" involves the suffering of chickens, pigs, cows, calves, sheep, and the like.\n\nB. The suffering of the puppies is necessary for gustatory pleasure, whereas the suffering of animals on factory farms is simply a by-product of the conditions dictated by economic considerations.\n\nC. Fred could prevent the suffering of the puppies, whereas meat-eaters can't prevent the suffering of the animals they consume.\n\nD. None of the above.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Norcross's argument. I think he uses a thought experiment involving a person named Fred who considers kicking a puppy for no reason other than for the pleasure of it. Norcross compares this to the act of eating factory-farmed meat, arguing that both involve causing suffering for pleasure, and that the moral relevance is similar.\n\nNow, looking at option A: It suggests that Fred's behavior involves the suffering of puppies, while meat-eaters involve suffering of other animals like chickens, pigs, etc. Norcross does discuss the suffering of animals in factory farming, so I think he acknowledges that both involve suffering of sentient beings. Maybe the difference here is that puppies are often seen as more similar to pets, making their suffering seem more direct or relatable. But I'm not sure if Norcross specifically addresses this difference.\n\nOption B: It says that the suffering of puppies is necessary for gustatory pleasure, whereas in factory farming, animal suffering is just a by-product of economic conditions. Wait, that seems a bit off. In Norcross's original argument, he suggests that eating factory-farmed meat involves causing suffering for the pleasure of eating meat, similar to kicking a puppy for the pleasure of it. So, actually, both involve suffering for pleasure. Maybe the option is trying to say that in factory farming, suffering is a by-product, but Norcross argues that it's a direct result of choosing to eat meat from factory farms.\n\nOption C: Fred could prevent the suffering of puppies, whereas meat-eaters can't prevent the suffering of the animals they consume. This seems interesting. Norcross's argument focuses on the moral wrongness of causing suffering for trivial reasons, like pleasure. Whether one can prevent the suffering might be a different consideration. Maybe Norcross doesn't emphasize the ability to prevent suffering in his comparison.\n\nGiven these thoughts, I'm leaning towards option C as something Norcross might not have discussed in his comparison. But I need to think more carefully.\n\nLet me consider each option again:\n\nA: Norcross does discuss the suffering of animals in factory farming, so the difference in the type of animal might not be a point he emphasizes. His thought experiment with Fred and the puppy is to highlight the moral inconsistency in treating some animals as friends and others as food.\n\nB: Norcross argues that eating factory-farmed meat involves directly causing suffering for pleasure, similar to kicking a puppy. So, the idea that suffering is a by-product of economic conditions might not align with his argument. He might argue that it's a direct result of the choice to eat factory-farmed meat.\n\nC: The ability to prevent suffering could be a morally relevant difference. If Fred could easily prevent the suffering of puppies but chooses not to, that might make his actions worse. Similarly, if meat-eaters could prevent animal suffering by choosing not to eat factory-farmed meat but choose to do so for pleasure, that might also be morally wrong. However, Norcross's main point seems to be about the moral wrongness of causing suffering for trivial reasons, not about the ability to prevent suffering.\n\nD: None of the above suggests that all the differences listed are discussed by Norcross, which might not be the case.\n\nGiven this, I think the answer is C: Fred could prevent the suffering of the puppies, whereas meat-eaters can't prevent the suffering of the animals they consume. This difference isn't directly addressed in Norcross's comparison, as his focus is on the moral wrongness of causing suffering for pleasure, rather than on the ability to prevent suffering.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if Norcross does discuss the ability to prevent suffering. In his original argument, he might imply that by choosing not to eat factory-farmed meat, one can prevent animal suffering. Similarly, Fred could choose not to kick the puppy to prevent its suffering. So, in a way, both scenarios involve a choice to prevent suffering by not engaging in the pleasure-seeking behavior. Therefore, perhaps Norcross does consider the ability to prevent suffering.\n\nHowever, the way option C is phrased\u2014\u201cFred could prevent the suffering of the puppies, whereas meat-eaters can't prevent the suffering of the animals they consume\u201d\u2014suggests that meat-eaters cannot prevent the suffering, which might not be accurate. If meat-eaters choose alternative diets or meat from sources with better animal welfare standards, they could potentially reduce the demand for factory-farmed meat and thus prevent some animal suffering. So, perhaps Norcross does consider this aspect indirectly.\n\nGiven this consideration, maybe option C isn't the best answer. Perhaps option A or B is more accurate.\n\nLet me look back at option A: Fred's behavior involves the suffering of puppies, whereas the behavior of meat-eaters \"merely\" involves the suffering of chickens, pigs, cows, calves, sheep, and the like. Norcross does discuss the suffering of these animals in factory farming, so it's not that he ignores the suffering of these species. The word \"merely\" might imply a hierarchy of suffering based on the type of animal, which Norcross might not endorse. He might argue that all sentient animals' suffering is morally relevant.\n\nOption B: The suffering of the puppies is necessary for gustatory pleasure, whereas the suffering of animals on factory farms is simply a by-product of the conditions dictated by economic considerations. Norcross's argument is that eating factory-farmed meat involves causing suffering for the pleasure of eating meat, similar to kicking a puppy for the pleasure of it. So, he might not agree with the characterization that suffering in factory farming is just a by-product. He might argue that it's a direct result of the choice to eat factory-farmed meat.\n\nGiven this, perhaps option B is something Norcross doesn't discuss, but I think he does emphasize that the suffering in factory farming is a direct consequence of choosing to eat meat from such farms.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that Norcross's argument is about the moral wrongness of causing suffering for trivial reasons, regardless of whether it's for gustatory pleasure or not. So, the difference in the necessity of suffering for gustatory pleasure might not be a point he focuses on.\n\nI'm starting to think that none of the above is the correct answer, meaning that all the differences listed are discussed by Norcross in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is D: none of the above, meaning that all these differences are discussed by Norcross.\n\nBut the question specifies \"which of the following potentially morally relevant differences between Fred's behavior and the behavior of the consumers of factory-raised meat does Norcross not discuss?\"\n\nGiven that, and considering my earlier thoughts, I'm still leaning towards option C as something Norcross might not have directly addressed in his comparison.\n\nTo sum it up, I think the answer is C: Fred could prevent the suffering of the puppies, whereas meat-eaters can't prevent the suffering of the animals they consume.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
