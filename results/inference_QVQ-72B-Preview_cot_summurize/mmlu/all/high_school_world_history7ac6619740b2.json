                    "text": "So I've got this passage from Sukarno's speech at the Bandung Conference in 1955, and I need to figure out which development it's most associated with. The options are:\n\nA. The formation of the non-aligned movement\n\nB. Global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation\n\nC. The Green Revolution in agriculture\n\nD. Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology\n\nFirst, I should understand what the Bandung Conference was about. I recall that it was a meeting of Asian and African nations in 1955, during the Cold War era. It was a significant event where these countries discussed issues related to colonialism, racism, and the Cold War tensions.\n\nSukarno was the first president of Indonesia, and he was a key figure in the conference. His speech emphasizes the importance of peace and independence for these nations. He says that without peace, their independence means little and that their revolutions won't be allowed to run their course. He also mentions that they can do much by injecting reason into world affairs and mobilizing the strengths of Asia and Africa on the side of peace.\n\nSo, peace is a central theme here, and it's about preserving peace to ensure that these countries can develop and maintain their independence.\n\nNow, let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A: The formation of the non-aligned movement.\n\nI know that the non-aligned movement was formed during the Cold War by countries that wanted to stay neutral and not align with either the United States or the Soviet Union. This movement was about maintaining independence in foreign policy and avoiding entanglement in superpower conflicts.\n\nGiven that Sukarno's speech emphasizes preserving peace and independence without aligning with external powers, this seems relevant. The Bandung Conference itself was a precursor to the non-aligned movement, which was formally established in 1961.\n\nOption B: Global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation.\n\nWhile peace is a part of this, the focus here is specifically on reducing arms and preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. While many countries, including those in the non-aligned movement, advocated for disarmament, the speech doesn't specifically mention disarmament or nuclear weapons.\n\nOption C: The Green Revolution in agriculture.\n\nThe Green Revolution was about transforming agriculture through new technologies, high-yield crops, and modern farming practices. While development and upbuilding of countries were mentioned in the speech, there's no specific reference to agricultural reforms or technologies.\n\nOption D: Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology.\n\nPan-Asianism is about unity among Asian countries, often emphasizing common cultural or political goals. While the speech mentions mobilizing the strengths of Asia and Africa, it's more about cooperation for peace and independence rather than a specific pan-Asian ideology.\n\nConsidering all this, option A seems the most fitting. The formation of the non-aligned movement was about preserving peace and independence by staying neutral in the superpower conflicts, which aligns closely with Sukarno's message in this speech.\n\nBut let me double-check. Was the non-aligned movement primarily about peace, or was it about more than that?\n\nThe non-aligned movement was indeed about staying neutral in the Cold War, but it also advocated for the interests of its member states in international affairs, including decolonization, disarmament, and cooperation in economic and cultural fields.\n\nHowever, in the context of this passage, the main emphasis is on preserving peace and independence, which are core principles of the non-aligned movement.\n\nMoreover, the Bandung Conference was a stepping stone towards the formation of the non-aligned movement, as it brought together newly independent countries from Asia and Africa who shared similar challenges and aspirations.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A. The formation of the non-aligned movement.\n\nJust to make sure, let's see if there's any direct connection between the speech and the other options.\n\nFor option B, while some non-aligned countries did advocate for disarmament, the speech doesn't specifically mention disarmament or nuclear weapons. So, it's less directly related.\n\nOption C, the Green Revolution, was more about agricultural advancements and wasn't the main focus of the Bandung Conference or Sukarno's speech.\n\nOption D, pan-Asian ideology, might be somewhat related since the Bandung Conference involved Asian and African countries, but the speech emphasizes cooperation for peace and independence rather than a solely pan-Asian ideology.\n\nTherefore, I believe the best answer is A. The formation of the non-aligned movement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
