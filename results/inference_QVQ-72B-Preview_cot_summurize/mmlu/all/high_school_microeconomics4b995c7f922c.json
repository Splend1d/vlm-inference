                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this economics concept here. The question is about how a decrease in the price of a product affects a consumer's buying behavior, especially when there's a substitute product whose price stays the same. It says that when the price of one product decreases, and the substitute's price doesn't change, the consumer buys more of this product. And it asks what this is called: income effect, substitution effect, marginal effect, or supply effect.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with the income effect: when the price of a good decreases, it essentially increases the purchasing power of the consumer's income. So, the consumer can buy more goods overall, not just more of the cheaper good. But in this case, the question mentions that the substitute's price remains constant, and the consumer is specifically buying more of this product, not necessarily increasing overall purchases. So, maybe the income effect isn't the primary driver here.\n\nNext, the substitution effect: this is when the relative price of two goods changes. If one good becomes cheaper compared to its substitute, consumers tend to buy more of the cheaper good and less of the more expensive one. In this scenario, the price of one product decreases while the substitute's price stays the same, so the relative price has changed. This makes the cheaper product more attractive, leading consumers to buy more of it.\n\nLet's consider the marginal effect. I'm not sure about this one. Is there such a thing as a marginal effect in this context? Maybe it's a typo or not relevant to this situation. I think I should skip this option for now.\n\nThen there's the supply effect. Supply effect usually refers to changes in quantity supplied in response to price changes, from the producer's perspective. But in this question, we're talking about consumer behavior, not producer behavior. So, supply effect probably isn't the right answer here.\n\nSo, between income effect and substitution effect, which one fits better?\n\nLet me think again. The income effect is about the increased purchasing power allowing consumers to buy more of all goods, whereas the substitution effect is about shifting consumption towards the relatively cheaper good.\n\nIn this scenario, since the substitute's price hasn't changed, the consumer is facing a change in the relative prices of these two goods. Therefore, the substitution effect would suggest that the consumer buys more of the now cheaper good and less of the substitute.\n\nBut, there's also the income effect to consider. If the price of one good decreases, and the consumer buys more of that good, part of that increased purchase is due to the increased purchasing power, not just the relative price change.\n\nHowever, the question specifies that the consumer buys more of this product, implying that the substitution effect is at play because of the relative price change.\n\nWait a minute, maybe both income and substitution effects are at work here. But the question is asking for a single term that describes this situation.\n\nLet me see if I can find a diagram to illustrate this.\n\nSuppose there are two goods: A and B, where B is the substitute for A.\n\nInitially, the consumer is at equilibrium point E1, consuming quantities of A and B at prices P_A and P_B.\n\nNow, if the price of A decreases to P_A', while P_B remains constant, the budget line rotates outward along the A-axis.\n\nThis rotation leads to a new equilibrium point, say E2, where the consumer buys more of A and possibly less of B.\n\nThe movement from E1 to E2 can be decomposed into the income effect and the substitution effect.\n\nThe substitution effect is the change in consumption due to the relative price change, holding the real income constant.\n\nThe income effect is the change in consumption due to the increased purchasing power.\n\nIn this case, since the substitute's price hasn't changed, the substitution effect would push the consumer to buy more of A because it's relatively cheaper now.\n\nThe income effect would also likely lead to buying more of A, assuming A is a normal good.\n\nBut the question is phrased in a way that suggests a single effect is primarily responsible for the increase in purchase of this product.\n\nPerhaps the substitution effect is the more direct reason, given the specific change in relative prices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the income effect is also significant, but the question is trying to highlight the substitution effect.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: if the price of A decreases and the price of B remains the same, and the consumer buys more of A, it's primarily due to the substitution effect.\n\nBecause, even if the income effect were considered, the substitution effect is specifically about the relative price change between A and B.\n\nSo, in this context, the substitution effect would cause the consumer to switch from B to A, leading to an increase in the purchase of A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be the substitution effect.\n\nLet me check the other options again to make sure.\n\nIncome effect: while there is an increase in purchasing power, the specific increase in purchase of A is more directly due to its relative cheapness, which is the substitution effect.\n\nMarginal effect: not sure what this refers to in this context; perhaps it's not relevant here.\n\nSupply effect: This relates to producer behavior, not consumer behavior.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. substitution effect.\n\nI think that's the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
