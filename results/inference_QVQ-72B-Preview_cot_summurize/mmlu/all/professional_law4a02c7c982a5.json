Among the purposes of the statute are the prevention of theft of boats in coastal waters and the protection of the rights of individual boat owners throughout the United States. Congress enacted the statute despite the fact that all states require boat owners to register their craft with the state department of motor vehicles. In addition, there is uncontradicted evidence that most stolen boats are kept or resold in the state in which the theft occurred. Nonetheless, an increasing number of boats are transported to other states and other countries for resale. Is the statute likely to be held constitutional?\n\nA. No, because most stolen boats remain within the state in which they were stolen.\nB. No, because the registration of boats is a matter reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment.\nC. Yes, because Congress could determine that the transportation of stolen boats affects interstate commerce.\nD. Yes, because Congress has the power to regulate property for the general welfare.\n"

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question about whether a new federal statute requiring boat registration is constitutional. Let me try to wrap my head around this.\n\nSo, Congress passed this law that says all boat owners have to register their boats with a federal boat registry. The reasons given are to prevent boat theft in coastal waters and to protect boat owners' rights across the country. But here's the thing: all states already have their own boat registration systems through their department of motor vehicles. Despite that, Congress decided to step in with a federal registry.\n\nThe question mentions that most stolen boats are either kept or resold within the same state where they were stolen. However, there's an increasing trend of boats being taken to other states or even other countries for resale. So, even though the majority are staying within the state, there's a growing issue of boats being moved across state lines and internationally.\n\nNow, the question is asking whether this statute is likely to be held constitutional. It gives four options:\n\nA. No, because most stolen boats remain within the state in which they were stolen.\n\nB. No, because the registration of boats is a matter reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment.\n\nC. Yes, because Congress could determine that the transportation of stolen boats affects interstate commerce.\n\nD. Yes, because Congress has the power to regulate property for the general welfare.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about this in terms of the U.S. Constitution and the powers of Congress.\n\nFirst off, the Tenth Amendment says that any powers not delegated to the federal government by the Constitution, nor prohibited to the states, are reserved to the states or to the people. So, option B is claiming that boat registration is a state matter under the Tenth Amendment.\n\nBut, I recall that Congress has several enumerated powers in the Constitution, particularly the power to regulate interstate commerce. The Commerce Clause is a big deal, and it's been interpreted pretty broadly over the years.\n\nIn this case, the statute is aimed at preventing boat theft and protecting boat owners' rights, with a specific mention of theft in coastal waters. Coastal waters can involve multiple states, especially since boats can easily cross state lines when sailing along coasts.\n\nMoreover, the fact that an increasing number of stolen boats are being transported to other states and other countries suggests that there is an interstate and international aspect to this issue.\n\nSo, if Congress is using its commerce powers to address something that affects multiple states and potentially international trade, that seems like a legitimate use of its authority under the Commerce Clause.\n\nOption C suggests that Congress could determine that the transportation of stolen boats affects interstate commerce, which aligns with what I'm thinking. That seems like a solid reason to consider the statute constitutional.\n\nOption D mentions Congress's power to regulate property for the general welfare. Well, the General Welfare Clause is part of the Preamble to the Constitution and is often linked to Congress's taxing and spending powers. While Congress does have the power to regulate commerce and promote the general welfare through its commerce powers, the General Welfare Clause isn't typically seen as a standalone basis for regulating property directly.\n\nSo, maybe option D is a bit of a stretch. It's more about regulating commerce than directly regulating property for the general welfare.\n\nOption A argues that because most stolen boats remain within the state, the statute is unconstitutional. But, even if most boats stay in the state, the fact that a significant and increasing number are being transported across state lines could be enough for Congress to step in under its commerce powers.\n\nSimilarly, option B claims that boat registration is a state matter under the Tenth Amendment. However, if Congress is acting within its commerce powers, which supersede state authority in certain areas, then this might not hold up.\n\nI think the key here is the Commerce Clause. If Congress can show that the transportation of stolen boats affects interstate commerce, then it has the authority to regulate it.\n\nLet me think about some Supreme Court cases related to the Commerce Clause. There's the famous case of Wickard v. Filburn, where the Court held that even intrastate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce can be regulated by Congress. In that case, it was about growing wheat for personal use, which might seem unrelated to interstate commerce, but the Court said that if everyone did that, it would affect the national market for wheat.\n\nSimilarly, here, even if most stolen boats are kept or resold within the state, the growing trend of boats being taken across state lines could be seen as substantially affecting interstate commerce. Especially since boats are valuable assets, and their theft and resale could impact the national boat market, insurance rates, and so on.\n\nAnother case is Gonzales v. Raich, where the Supreme Court upheld Congress's ability to regulate local marijuana cultivation under the Commerce Clause, again based on the idea that local activities can have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\n\nSo, based on these precedents, it seems like Congress has the authority to regulate the transportation of stolen boats across state lines, even if the majority are not being transported interstate.\n\nTherefore, I would say that the statute is likely to be held constitutional because Congress can determine that the transportation of stolen boats affects interstate commerce.\n\nThat makes option C the correct answer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, even if most stolen boats remain in the state, the interstate aspect is significant enough for Congress to regulate under the Commerce Clause.\n\nOption B is incorrect because, while states do have the power to regulate boat registration, Congress can preempt state laws when acting within its constitutional powers, such as regulating interstate commerce.\n\nOption D is somewhat vague, but it's not as directly relevant as the Commerce Clause in this scenario.\n\nSo, my final answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
