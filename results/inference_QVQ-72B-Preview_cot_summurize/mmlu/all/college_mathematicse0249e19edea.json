                    "text": "On this problem, it says that x feet of fencing is used to form three sides of a rectangular yard. So, I need to figure out what the maximum possible area of this yard can be, expressed in terms of x. The options are x\u00b2/9, x\u00b2/8, x\u00b2/4, and x\u00b2.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. A rectangular yard has three sides fenced because, I assume, one side is bounded by something else, like a wall or a natural boundary, so fencing is only needed for the other three sides.\n\nLet me visualize this. Suppose the yard is rectangular, and one of its longer sides is already bounded by a wall, so I only need to fence the opposite long side and the two short sides. Wait, but it could be any orientation. The problem doesn't specify which three sides are being fenced.\n\nTo make it general, let's assume that the rectangle has length L and width W, and the three sides being fenced are two widths and one length. Wait, that might not be necessarily the case. Maybe it's two lengths and one width, or two widths and one length. The problem doesn't specify, so I need to consider that.\n\nActually, for a rectangle, there are two possibilities: either two widths and one length are fenced, or two lengths and one width are fenced. I need to consider both cases and see which one gives the maximum area.\n\nLet's consider the first case: two widths and one length are fenced.\n\nSo, the total fencing used is 2W + L = x.\n\nI need to express L in terms of W and x: L = x - 2W.\n\nNow, the area A of the rectangle is L * W, so A = (x - 2W) * W = xW - 2W\u00b2.\n\nTo find the maximum area, I can take the derivative of A with respect to W and set it to zero.\n\ndA/dW = x - 4W = 0 \u21d2 W = x/4.\n\nThen, L = x - 2(x/4) = x - x/2 = x/2.\n\nSo, the area is (x/2)(x/4) = x\u00b2/8.\n\nWait, but one of the options is x\u00b2/8, which is option B.\n\nBut I should check if this is indeed the maximum possible area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the other case, where two lengths and one width are fenced.\n\nSo, in that case, 2L + W = x.\n\nThen, W = x - 2L.\n\nThe area A = L * W = L(x - 2L) = xL - 2L\u00b2.\n\nAgain, take the derivative with respect to L: dA/dL = x - 4L = 0 \u21d2 L = x/4.\n\nThen, W = x - 2(x/4) = x - x/2 = x/2.\n\nSo, area A = (x/4)(x/2) = x\u00b2/8.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, in both cases, whether it's two widths and one length or two lengths and one width being fenced, the maximum area is x\u00b2/8.\n\nBut wait, the options include x\u00b2/9, x\u00b2/4, and x\u00b2. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think differently. Perhaps using the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality (AM-GM).\n\nFor the first case, 2W + L = x.\n\nTo maximize A = L * W, subject to L + 2W = x.\n\nUsing AM-GM:\n\n(L + 2W)/2 \u2265 sqrt(2LW)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.\n\nAlternatively, I can solve for one variable in terms of the other.\n\nFrom L + 2W = x, L = x - 2W.\n\nThen, A = (x - 2W)W = xW - 2W\u00b2.\n\nTo find the maximum, take the derivative dA/dW = x - 4W.\n\nSet to zero: x - 4W = 0 \u21d2 W = x/4.\n\nThen, L = x - 2(x/4) = x/2.\n\nSo, A = (x/2)(x/4) = x\u00b2/8.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the three sides being fenced are not necessarily two widths and one length or two lengths and one width. Maybe any three sides are being fenced, regardless of which sides they are.\n\nIf that's the case, then the total fencing is L + W + something else, but I need to ensure that it forms a rectangle.\n\nWait, perhaps it's L + 2W = x, or 2L + W = x, as I considered earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's L + W + some other side, but I need to make sure it forms a closed shape.\n\nGiven that it's a rectangular yard with three sides fenced, I think the most straightforward interpretation is that two parallel sides and one perpendicular side are being fenced.\n\nSo, either two widths and one length, or two lengths and one width.\n\nIn both cases, I end up with A = x\u00b2/8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's L + W + some diagonal, but that doesn't make sense in the context of fencing sides.\n\nNo, it's probably just three sides of the rectangle.\n\nGiven that, I think x\u00b2/8 is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way.\n\nSuppose I use the quadratic equation to express A in terms of W.\n\nA = W(x - 2W) = -2W\u00b2 + xW.\n\nThis is a downward-opening parabola in W.\n\nThe maximum occurs at W = -b/(2a) = -x/(2*(-2)) = x/4.\n\nThen, L = x - 2(x/4) = x/2.\n\nSo, A = (x/2)(x/4) = x\u00b2/8.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, using L + 2W = x.\n\nSo, L = x - 2W.\n\nThen, A = L * W = (x - 2W)W = xW - 2W\u00b2.\n\nAgain, maximum at W = x/4, leading to A = x\u00b2/8.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nWait, but maybe I should use Lagrange multipliers or something, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three sides being fenced are L + W + W = x, which is L + 2W = x, same as before.\n\nOr L + L + W = x, which is 2L + W = x, same as the other case.\n\nIn both scenarios, I end up with A = x\u00b2/8.\n\nBut the options include x\u00b2/9 and x\u00b2/4, which are different.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the fencing is for three sides, but they are not necessarily two widths and one length or two lengths and one width.\n\nMaybe it's any three sides.\n\nIn that case, perhaps I need to consider all possible combinations.\n\nLet me denote the rectangle sides as L and W, with L possibly not equal to W.\n\nThe three sides being fenced could be:\n\n1. Two widths and one length: 2W + L = x.\n\n2. Two lengths and one width: 2L + W = x.\n\n3. One width and two lengths: W + 2L = x.\n\nWait, but 3 is the same as 2.\n\nSo, only two distinct cases: 2W + L = x and 2L + W = x.\n\nIn both cases, I get A = x\u00b2/8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in one of these cases, I get a different result.\n\nBut as I calculated earlier, both give A = x\u00b2/8.\n\nWait, in the first case, L = x - 2W, and A = L * W = (x - 2W)W = xW - 2W\u00b2.\n\nTaking derivative dA/dW = x - 4W = 0 \u21d2 W = x/4.\n\nThen, L = x - 2(x/4) = x/2.\n\nSo, A = (x/2)(x/4) = x\u00b2/8.\n\nIn the second case, 2L + W = x \u21d2 W = x - 2L.\n\nThen, A = L * W = L(x - 2L) = xL - 2L\u00b2.\n\nTaking derivative dA/dL = x - 4L = 0 \u21d2 L = x/4.\n\nThen, W = x - 2(x/4) = x/2.\n\nSo, A = (x/4)(x/2) = x\u00b2/8.\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nSo, it seems consistent.\n\nBut maybe there's a different approach.\n\nLet me try to express everything in terms of one variable.\n\nLet\u2019s say W is one side, and L is the other side.\n\nThen, the three sides being fenced are L, W, and W, totaling to x.\n\nSo, L + 2W = x.\n\nAlternatively, if it's L, L, and W, then 2L + W = x.\n\nBut as I saw earlier, both give A = x\u00b2/8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fencing is not just for three sides, but perhaps there's an overlap or something, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fencing is for three sides, but they are not necessarily adjacent sides.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense in the context of a rectangular yard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fencing is for three separate pieces, not necessarily forming a continuous enclosure.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fencing is for three sides of a rectangle, but the rectangle is not necessarily a simple rectangle, maybe it's a more complex shape.\n\nBut that seems beyond the scope of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fencing is for three sides, but they are not all straight lines, but again, that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fencing is for three sides, but one of them is a curved side, but again, the problem specifies a rectangular yard.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to assume that it's a rectangle with three sides fenced.\n\nTherefore, the maximum area is x\u00b2/8.\n\nBut the options include x\u00b2/9, which is different.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in assuming that the fenced sides are two widths and one length or two lengths and one width.\n\nPerhaps in one of the cases, the maximum area is different.\n\nWait, in both cases, I get x\u00b2/8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fencing is for three sides, but they are not necessarily two parallel sides and one perpendicular side.\n\nBut in a rectangle, any three sides will consist of two parallel sides and one perpendicular side.\n\nSo, I think my earlier assumption is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fencing is for three sides, but they are not all straight lines, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fencing is for three sides, but one of them is a curved side, but again, the problem specifies a rectangular yard.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to assume that it's a rectangle with three sides fenced.\n\nTherefore, the maximum area is x\u00b2/8.\n\nBut since x\u00b2/9 is an option, maybe I need to consider that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is misinterpreted, and the fencing is for three sides of a square, not a rectangle.\n\nBut the problem says a rectangular yard, so it's a rectangle, not necessarily a square.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fencing is for three sides, but they are not all straight lines, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fencing is for three sides, but one of them is a curved side, but again, the problem specifies a rectangular yard.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to assume
