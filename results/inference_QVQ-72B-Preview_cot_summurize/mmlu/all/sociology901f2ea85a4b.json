                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about Judith Butler's ideas. The options are:\n\nA. Sexual characteristics are the biological determinants of gender.\n\nB. Heterosexuality and homosexuality are essential, opposing identities.\n\nC. The 'two-sex' model replaced the 'one-sex' model in the eighteenth century.\n\nD. Gender is performed through bodily gestures and styles to create 'sex'.\n\nAnd the question is, which one of these did Judith Butler suggest in 1999?\n\nFirst, I need to recall who Judith Butler is and what she's known for. I remember that Judith Butler is a philosopher and gender theorist who is famous for her ideas on gender performativity. She has written several books, and one of her most famous is \"Gender Trouble,\" which was published in 1990. But the question specifies 1999, so maybe she wrote something else that year that's relevant.\n\nLet me think about her publications in 1999. A quick search in my mind brings up \"Antigone's Claim: Kinship Between Life and Death,\" but I'm not sure if that's the one that contains the ideas listed here. Maybe I should look back at her other works.\n\nOption A says that sexual characteristics are the biological determinants of gender. This sounds like something that Butler would critique. She is known for arguing against the idea that gender is solely determined by biology. In \"Gender Trouble,\" she challenges the notion that gender is fixed and biologically determined, suggesting instead that gender is a social construct performed through repeated actions.\n\nSo, option A doesn't seem right. It's more of a traditional view that Butler would oppose.\n\nOption B says that heterosexuality and homosexuality are essential, opposing identities. Again, this seems contrary to Butler's views. She is known for critiquing essentialist notions of sexuality and gender. She argues that sexual orientations are not fixed or essential but are socially constructed and performed.\n\nTherefore, option B is likely not something Butler would suggest; rather, she would probably argue the opposite.\n\nOption C mentions that the 'two-sex' model replaced the 'one-sex' model in the eighteenth century. I recall that the 'one-sex' model was a theory where both males and females were thought to have the same bodily structures, just arranged differently. The 'two-sex' model recognized distinct male and female anatomies. This historical shift might be something Butler discusses in her work, but I'm not sure if she specifically claims that it happened in the eighteenth century.\n\nI need to verify this. Maybe in some of her writings, she discusses the history of sex and gender concepts. However, I think her main focus is more on the performative nature of gender rather than the historical shift in anatomical understanding.\n\nOption D states that gender is performed through bodily gestures and styles to create 'sex.' This sounds very much like Butler's theory of gender performativity. She argues that gender is not an inherent quality but is constructed through repeated performances of behavior, speech, and bodily gestures that conform to cultural norms of masculinity or femininity.\n\nMoreover, she suggests that these performances are so habitual that they come to be seen as natural and fixed, when in fact they are socially constructed and can be changed or subverted.\n\nGiven this, option D seems to align closely with Butler's ideas, particularly those presented in \"Gender Trouble\" and other works.\n\nBut the question specifies 1999. Did Butler publish anything in 1999 that reinforces this idea?\n\nAs I thought earlier, \"Antigone's Claim\" was published in 1999. I need to recall if that book delves deeper into her theories of performativity or if it shifts focus to other areas like kinship and death.\n\nPerhaps her ideas on gender performativity continued to be a theme in that work, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she wrote articles or essays in 1999 that specifically address gender performativity.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should consider that the question might be referring to her influence or the reception of her work in 1999.\n\nBut that seems unlikely. The way the question is phrased\u2014\u201cJudith Butler (1999) suggested that:\u201d\u2014implies that in 1999, she put forward one of these statements.\n\nGiven that, and considering her body of work, I think option D is the most accurate reflection of her ideas, particularly her theory of gender performativity.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider each option again:\n\nA. Sexual characteristics are the biological determinants of gender.\n\n- This is opposite to Butler's views.\n\nB. Heterosexuality and homosexuality are essential, opposing identities.\n\n- Again, this contradicts her critique of essentialism in sexuality.\n\nC. The 'two-sex' model replaced the 'one-sex' model in the eighteenth century.\n\n- While this might be a historical fact that Butler discusses, it's not her main theoretical contribution.\n\nD. Gender is performed through bodily gestures and styles to create 'sex'.\n\n- This is a core aspect of her theory of gender performativity.\n\nTherefore, despite the reference to 1999, which isn't directly associated with a specific work of hers in that year, option D is still the best answer based on her well-known theories.\n\nMaybe the year 1999 is a distractor, and the question is testing whether I know that Butler is famous for her ideas on gender performativity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in 1999, she gave a lecture or published an article that emphasized this point.\n\nBut without specific knowledge of that, I'll stick with option D as the correct answer.\n\nSo, my final answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
