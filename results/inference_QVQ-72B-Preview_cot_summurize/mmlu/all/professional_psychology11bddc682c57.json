The options are:\n\nA. 2 to 3 months\n\nB. 4 to 6 months\n\nC. 8 to 10 months\n\nD. 12 to 14 months\n\nHmm, I remember learning about this in my child development class. Stranger anxiety is when babies start feeling uneasy around people they don't know. It's a normal part of their development as they learn to distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar people.\n\nLet me think about this. I think it usually starts around the time babies are becoming more aware of their surroundings and starting to form attachments to their primary caregivers. So, probably not in the first few months of life because they're still getting used to the world.\n\nOption A is 2 to 3 months. That seems a bit early. At that age, babies are mostly focused on basic needs like eating and sleeping. They're still developing their ability to focus and interact with their environment.\n\nOption B is 4 to 6 months. This seems like a possible time because babies at this age are more alert, interacting more with people and objects, and starting to recognize familiar faces and voices. Maybe they begin to show some caution around strangers around this time.\n\nOption C is 8 to 10 months. This also seems plausible. By this age, babies have stronger attachments to their caregivers and might be more likely to show anxiety or distress when approached by someone they don't know.\n\nOption D is 12 to 14 months. At this stage, toddlers are more mobile and exploring their environment more independently. They might still show stranger anxiety, but I think it peaks earlier than this.\n\nI need to recall when stranger anxiety typically begins. I think it starts around 6 to 8 months and peaks around 12 to 15 months. So, according to that, the correct answer would be option C, 8 to 10 months.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm confusing it with something else. I recall that infants start recognizing and preferring familiar faces around 3 to 4 months, but stranger anxiety might not set in until a bit later.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the typical age range for the onset of stranger anxiety. A quick search in my notes tells me that stranger anxiety begins around 6 to 8 months of age, which would still point to option C, 8 to 10 months, as a possible answer.\n\nBut now I'm a bit confused because one of the options is 4 to 6 months, which is earlier. Maybe it varies from child to child, but generally, it's around 8 months.\n\nLet me consider the developmental milestones at each age range:\n\n- 2 to 3 months: Babies are starting to smile socially and respond to voices, but still not very discriminating.\n\n- 4 to 6 months: They can track moving objects, recognize familiar faces and voices, and may start showing mild caution around strangers.\n\n- 8 to 10 months: They have well-established attachments and may show clear signs of anxiety or distress around unfamiliar people.\n\n- 12 to 14 months: Toddlers may still show stranger anxiety, but they're also becoming more independent and adventurous.\n\nFrom this, it seems that the most common age for stranger anxiety to begin is around 8 to 10 months, which is option C.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check an online resource or a textbook on child development. Oh, wait, I don't have my textbooks with me right now. Maybe I can recall some key points.\n\nI remember that stranger anxiety is part of a larger development of fear and caution in infants as they become more mobile and aware of their environment. It's a sign that they're learning to distinguish between safe and potentially unsafe situations.\n\nIn summary, based on my knowledge and the typical age ranges for developmental milestones, I would say that stranger anxiety begins at about 8 to 10 months of age, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
