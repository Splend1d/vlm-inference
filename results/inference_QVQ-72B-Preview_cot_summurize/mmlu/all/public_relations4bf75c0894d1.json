                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of the following entities cannot sue for libel?\" And the options are A. A politician, B. A house of worship, C. A government institution, D. A publicly-traded company. Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out which one of these can't sue for libel.\n\nFirst off, I know that libel is a type of defamation where false statements are published about someone, damaging their reputation. Usually, individuals can sue for libel, but I think there are some exceptions when it comes to certain entities.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with A. A politician. Politicians are public figures, and I know that public figures have to meet higher standards to win a libel suit. They have to prove that the false statements were made with actual malice or reckless disregard for the truth. But can they sue? Yeah, I think they can, but it's harder for them to win the case because of their public status.\n\nNext, B. A house of worship. This seems like an interesting one. A house of worship is likely considered an organization or entity with a reputation that can be damaged. I would think that if someone publishes false information about a church, mosque, synagogue, etc., that damages its reputation, they might have grounds to sue for libel. So, probably can sue.\n\nThen, C. A government institution. This one makes me pause. Governments and government institutions are a bit tricky because they're part of the public sector. I recall that in some jurisdictions, governments can't sue for libel because they're supposed to be open to criticism and scrutiny. Plus, there might be sovereign immunity issues that prevent them from suing in certain cases. But, I'm not entirely sure, so I need to look into this more.\n\nLastly, D. A publicly-traded company. Companies, in general, can sue for libel because they have a reputation that can be harmed by false statements. However, publicly-traded companies might have additional considerations due to their status and the impact of statements on their stock price and investor confidence. But, I think they can still sue for libel if false statements are made about them.\n\nSo, comparing all these, the one that seems least likely to be able to sue for libel is C. A government institution. My reasoning is that governments are supposed to be accountable to the public, and allowing them to sue for libel might chill free speech and criticism, which is essential in a democracy.\n\nBut, I should double-check this. Maybe there are specific laws or precedents that allow or prevent government institutions from suing for libel.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that in many legal systems, including the United States, government entities are generally not permitted to sue for libel. This is often based on the principle of sovereign immunity, which limits the government's ability to sue without explicit authorization by law. Additionally, allowing governments to sue for libel could suppress criticism and limit public discourse, which is protected under the First Amendment in the U.S.\n\nHowever, there might be exceptions or specific circumstances where a government institution can sue for libel, such as in cases involving false accusations of criminal activity or fraud that could harm the institution's ability to perform its functions.\n\nDespite this, compared to the other options, a government institution is the least likely to be able to sue for libel. Politicians, houses of worship, and publicly-traded companies all have clearer paths to pursuing libel claims, albeit with varying degrees of difficulty based on their status or the nature of the statements made against them.\n\nTherefore, I would say that C. A government institution is the entity that cannot sue for libel.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
