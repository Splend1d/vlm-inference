                    "text": "So Jess scored 18 points in her last basketball game, and each basket she made was worth 2 points. I need to find out how many baskets she made. Okay, let's see.\n\nWell, if each basket is worth 2 points, then the number of baskets she made should be the total points divided by the points per basket. So, 18 points divided by 2 points per basket. That should give me 9 baskets, right?\n\nLet me double-check that. If she made 9 baskets, and each is worth 2 points, then 9 times 2 is 18, which matches her total score. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe if I consider that some baskets could be worth different points, like three-pointers or something. But no, the problem says each basket she made was worth 2 points, so I don't think there are any three-pointers included here. So, all baskets are worth 2 points.\n\nLet me see what the options are. Oh, here they are:\n\nA. 20\n\nB. 16\n\nC. 9\n\nD. 8\n\nSo, 9 is one of the options, which matches my calculation. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other information or possible interpretations.\n\nIs there a possibility that some baskets were worth more or fewer points? No, the problem states that each basket is worth 2 points. So, I think it's safe to assume that all baskets contribute 2 points each.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use the formula:\n\nNumber of baskets = total points / points per basket\n\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier: 18 / 2 = 9.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of multiplication. If each basket is 2 points, then to get 18 points, I need to multiply the number of baskets by 2 to get 18. Again, that leads me to 9 baskets.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Suppose she made 9 baskets, each worth 2 points:\n\n2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 18 points.\n\nYes, that adds up to 18. So, that seems correct.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider if she made 8 baskets:\n\n8 baskets \u00d7 2 points each = 16 points.\n\nBut she scored 18 points, so that's not enough.\n\nWhat about 10 baskets:\n\n10 baskets \u00d7 2 points each = 20 points.\n\nThat's more than she scored, so that's too much.\n\nTherefore, 9 baskets is the correct number.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and each time I arrive at the same answer: 9 baskets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
