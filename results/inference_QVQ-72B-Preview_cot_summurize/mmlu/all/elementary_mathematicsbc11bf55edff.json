                    "text": "Okay, so Jack picks 60 apples from an apple tree. He uses 12 of them to make applesauce. Then, he puts the remaining apples equally into 6 gift baskets. I need to find out which equation can be used to determine the number of apples, a, that Jack places into each gift basket.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many apples are left after he uses 12 to make applesauce. If he picked 60 apples and uses 12 for applesauce, then the remaining apples are 60 minus 12. That's 60 - 12.\n\nSo, remaining apples = 60 - 12 = 48 apples.\n\nNow, he puts these 48 apples equally into 6 gift baskets. To find out how many apples go into each basket, I need to divide the total remaining apples by the number of baskets. That is, a = 48 / 6.\n\nLet me calculate that: 48 divided by 6 equals 8. So, each basket gets 8 apples.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. (60/6) - 12 = a\n\nB. (60 - 12) / 6 = a\n\nC. (60 - 6) - 12 = a\n\nD. (60 + 12) / 6 = a\n\nI need to see which of these equations match the one I derived, which is a = (60 - 12) / 6.\n\nOption B looks exactly like that: (60 - 12) / 6 = a.\n\nLet me just double-check the other options to make sure they don't also yield the correct equation.\n\nOption A: (60/6) - 12 = a\n\nThis is 10 - 12 = -2, which doesn't make sense in this context, as you can't have negative apples.\n\nOption C: (60 - 6) - 12 = a\n\nThis is 54 - 12 = 42, which is not equal to 8.\n\nOption D: (60 + 12) / 6 = a\n\nThis is 72 / 6 = 12, which is not equal to 8.\n\nSo, clearly, only option B matches the correct equation.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the problem step by step.\n\nStep 1: Total apples picked = 60\n\nStep 2: Apples used for applesauce = 12\n\nStep 3: Remaining apples = 60 - 12 = 48\n\nStep 4: Number of gift baskets = 6\n\nStep 5: Apples per basket = 48 / 6 = 8\n\nSo, the equation is (60 - 12) / 6 = a.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any flaws in this reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
