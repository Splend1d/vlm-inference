                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question about words that all share a common meaning based on their affixes. The words are \"intercontinental,\" \"interglacial,\" \"interface,\" and \"intercept.\" The options are:\n\nA. between; among\n\nB. not; opposite of\n\nC. earth; environment\n\nD. under; too little\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an affix is. An affix is a prefix or suffix added to a root word to change its meaning or function. In this case, all these words start with \"inter,\" which is a prefix.\n\nSo, if I can figure out what \"inter\" means in these words, that should give me the common meaning they share.\n\nLet me look at each word one by one.\n\nFirst, \"intercontinental.\" I know that continental refers to landmasses, like continents. So, intercontinental must have something to do with between or among continents. That seems to align with option A, \"between; among.\"\n\nNext, \"interglacial.\" Glacial refers to ice ages or glaciers. I think interglacial periods are times between ice ages. So, again, it's about the period between glacial periods. That also points to \"between; among.\"\n\nNow, \"interface.\" This one is a bit trickier. I know that in computing, an interface is where different systems or users interact. The prefix \"inter\" here probably refers to interaction between different entities. So, again, it suggests the idea of \"between\" or \"among.\"\n\nLastly, \"intercept.\" In mathematics, an intercept is where a line crosses an axis. But I'm not sure about the literal meaning of \"intercept.\" Maybe it's about cutting in between something? That could still relate to \"between.\"\n\nLooking at all these, it seems like the prefix \"inter\" is consistently related to the concept of \"between\" or \"among\" in these words.\n\nLet me just double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B is \"not; opposite of.\" That would correspond to a prefix like \"in-\" or \"un-,\" but not \"inter.\"\n\nOption C is \"earth; environment.\" While \"intercontinental\" does relate to continents on Earth, and \"interglacial\" relates to Earth's climate, \"interface\" and \"intercept\" don't necessarily relate directly to Earth or the environment.\n\nOption D is \"under; too little.\" That would be more like the prefix \"under-\" or \"sub-,\" not \"inter.\"\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option A, \"between; among,\" seems to be the correct choice.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other meaning that \"inter\" could have in these contexts. For example, could \"inter\" have a temporal meaning, like \"between times\"? Maybe in \"interglacial,\" but that still boils down to \"between\" ice ages.\n\nIn \"interface,\" while it's about connection or interaction between systems, the \"inter\" part still points to the relationship between two or more entities.\n\nSimilarly, in \"intercept,\" even if it's about cutting across or meeting between points, the \"inter\" part suggests some intermediate position or interaction.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is option A: between; among.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
