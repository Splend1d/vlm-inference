It says that if something needs to be taken into account in moral decision-making, meaning it \"counts morally,\" then that person or thing has... And the options are:\n\nA. moral standing.\n\nB. moral permissibility.\n\nC. viability.\n\nD. all of the above.\n\nHmm, I need to figure this out. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, what does it mean for something to \"count morally\"? I think that means that it has some moral significance or that it's relevant to making moral decisions. So, when we make moral choices, we consider certain things or beings as having value or worth in the moral sense.\n\nOption A is \"moral standing.\" I recall from philosophy classes that moral standing refers to the capacity of a being to have interests that ought to be considered in moral decision-making. So, if something has moral standing, it means that it's morally significant and should be taken into account when making moral choices.\n\nOption B is \"moral permissibility.\" This seems a bit different. Moral permissibility is about whether an action is allowed or acceptable from a moral standpoint. It's more about the actions themselves rather than the beings or things that have moral worth.\n\nOption C is \"viability.\" Viability generally refers to the ability to be successful or capable of continuing to exist, like economic viability or viability of a species. It doesn't directly relate to moral decision-making in the way that moral standing does.\n\nGiven these understandings, it seems like moral standing is the concept that directly relates to something having moral significance and thus needing to be taken into account in moral decision-making.\n\nMoral permissibility is more about evaluating actions based on moral principles, not about determining what has moral worth.\n\nViability, on the other hand, is more about feasibility or survival and doesn't directly speak to the moral consideration of beings or things.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. moral standing.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any chance that viability could be related to moral decision-making in some contexts? For example, if we're considering the viability of a species, might that factor into moral decision-making because of its viability?\n\nWell, perhaps in some cases, but I think that's more of an indirect connection. The viability of a species might be a consideration in moral decision-making because the species has moral standing, not because viability itself confers moral standing.\n\nSo, I still think that moral standing is the most appropriate answer here.\n\nAs for moral permissibility, that seems unrelated to the concept of having moral worth. Moral permissibility is about whether an action is morally acceptable, whereas moral standing is about who or what is owed moral consideration.\n\nTherefore, I don't think B is correct.\n\nSimilarly, viability is about the ability to survive or succeed, which isn't directly connected to moral decision-making in the same way that moral standing is.\n\nSo, my final answer is A. moral standing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
