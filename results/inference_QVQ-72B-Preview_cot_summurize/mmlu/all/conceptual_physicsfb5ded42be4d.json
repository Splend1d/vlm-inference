                    "text": "An alpha particle is a particle consisting of two protons and two neutrons, which is identical to a helium-4 nucleus. When an element ejects an alpha particle through radioactive decay, known as alpha decay, it loses these two protons and two neutrons.\n\nThe mass number of an element is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. So, if an element has a mass number of A (protons + neutrons) and it ejects an alpha particle, which has a mass number of 4 (2 protons + 2 neutrons), the new mass number of the resulting element would be A minus 4.\n\nLet's consider an example to illustrate this. Suppose we have Carbon-14, which has a mass number of 14. If it undergoes alpha decay, the resulting element would have a mass number of 14 minus 4, which is 10. So, the mass number reduces by 4.\n\nWait a minute, but Carbon-14 is not typically known for undergoing alpha decay. Carbon-14 usually decays via beta decay, emitting a beta particle and transforming into Nitrogen-14. So, maybe choosing Carbon-14 isn't the best example for alpha decay.\n\nLet's pick another element that commonly undergoes alpha decay. For instance, Uranium-238 decays via alpha decay to form Thorium-234. The mass number of Uranium-238 is 238, and after emitting an alpha particle (mass number 4), it becomes Thorium-234, which is 238 minus 4 equals 234. This aligns with the idea that the mass number decreases by 4 during alpha decay.\n\nAnother example is Radium-226, which decays via alpha emission to form Radon-222. Again, 226 minus 4 is 222, confirming that the mass number decreases by 4.\n\nNow, let's think about why the mass number doesn't change by other amounts. For example, why doesn't the mass number decrease by 2 or increase by 2 or 4?\n\nFirst, decreasing by 2: That would correspond to losing two nucleons, but in alpha decay, we're losing two protons and two neutrons, which together make up an alpha particle. Since an alpha particle consists of two protons and two neutrons, removing it should decrease the mass number by 4, not by 2.\n\nIncreasing by 2 or 4: That wouldn't make sense in the context of alpha decay because alpha decay is defined as the emission of an alpha particle, which carries away two protons and two neutrons. Therefore, the mass number should decrease by 4.\n\nAdditionally, if we consider other types of radioactive decay, such as beta decay, which involves the emission of a beta particle (either an electron or a positron), the mass number remains unchanged because beta particles are either electrons or positrons, which are leptons and don't contribute to the mass number of the nucleus.\n\nIn gamma decay, the mass number also remains the same as it involves the emission of gamma rays, which are high-energy photons, and don't affect the number of nucleons in the nucleus.\n\nTherefore, in the context of alpha decay, the only correct option is that the mass number reduces by 4.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the atomic number as well. The atomic number (Z) of an element is determined by the number of protons in its nucleus. Since an alpha particle carries two protons, when an element emits an alpha particle, its atomic number decreases by 2.\n\nFor example, Uranium has an atomic number of 92, and after alpha decay, Thorium has an atomic number of 90. Similarly, Radium has an atomic number of 88, and Radon has an atomic number of 86. So, the atomic number decreases by 2 upon alpha decay.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks about the mass number, not the atomic number. So, focusing on the mass number, which is the sum of protons and neutrons, it decreases by 4 during alpha decay.\n\nTo further confirm, let's look at the general equation for alpha decay. The process can be represented as:\n\n$$_{Z}^{A}\\text{Parent} \\rightarrow _{Z-2}^{A-4}\\text{Daughter} + _{2}^{4}\\alpha$$\n\nWhere:\n\n- $$_{Z}^{A}\\text{Parent}$$ is the original nucleus with atomic number Z and mass number A.\n\n- $$_{Z-2}^{A-4}\\text{Daughter}$$ is the resulting nucleus after emitting an alpha particle.\n\n- $$_{2}^{4}\\alpha$$ is the alpha particle.\n\nFrom this general equation, it's clear that the mass number A of the parent nucleus decreases by 4 in the daughter nucleus.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. reduces by 4.\n\nJust to make sure, let's eliminate the other options:\n\nA. reduces by 2: This would be incorrect because, as we've seen, the alpha particle carries away two neutrons in addition to two protons, so the total mass number decreases by 4, not 2.\n\nC. increases by 2: This is also incorrect because alpha decay involves the loss of an alpha particle, which should decrease the mass number, not increase it.\n\nD. increases by 4: This is wrong for the same reason; emitting an alpha particle should decrease the mass number by 4.\n\nHence, the correct choice is B. reduces by 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
