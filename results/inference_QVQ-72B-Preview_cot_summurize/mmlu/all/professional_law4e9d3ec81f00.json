                    "text": "So Congress passed a law that stops people from discriminating based on race when selling, transferring, or renting real estate. That makes sense because everyone should have a fair shot at finding a place to live, no matter what they look like or where they come from. But the question is asking which part of the Constitution gives Congress the power to make such a law. There are a few options here, and I need to pick the best one.\n\nFirst, there's option A, which talks about Article I and the \"necessary and proper\" clause related to the general welfare. I remember that Article I is where Congress's powers are listed, and the necessary and proper clause allows Congress to pass laws that are needed to carry out its duties. But does that directly apply to preventing racial discrimination in housing? Hmm, maybe not directly. It seems a bit too broad for this specific issue.\n\nNext is option B, which mentions Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment. Let me think about the Thirteenth Amendment. I know that it abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime. Section 2 of that amendment gives Congress the power to enforce this through appropriate legislation. So, if discrimination in housing could be linked back to slavery or involuntary servitude, maybe this could be a rationale for the law. But I'm not entirely sure how direct that connection is. It might be a bit of a stretch.\n\nThen there's option C, which refers to Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Fourteenth Amendment is about equal protection under the law and citizenship rights. Specifically, it says that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Section 5 of this amendment empowers Congress to enforce these provisions by law. This seems pretty relevant to preventing racial discrimination in housing because it's about ensuring that everyone is treated equally under the law. Housing is a fundamental right or need, and if someone is being discriminated against based on race, that could be seen as a denial of equal protection.\n\nLastly, there's option D, the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. The Fifth Amendment primarily deals with procedural protections for individuals accused of crimes, like double jeopardy and self-incrimination. The due process clause in the Fifth Amendment says that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. While this is an important protection, it doesn't directly address discrimination or equal protection. So, I'm not sure how it directly relates to preventing racial discrimination in housing.\n\nComparing all these options, option C seems to be the most directly applicable. The Fourteenth Amendment is specifically about equal protection and citizenship rights, and Section 5 gives Congress the power to enforce those protections through legislation. Preventing racial discrimination in housing aligns closely with ensuring equal protection under the law.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about some landmark cases related to civil rights and housing discrimination. I recall that in the 1960s, there was a lot of civil rights legislation passed, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. These laws prohibited discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in employment and housing.\n\nI think the Fair Housing Act was enacted under Congress's power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment. Yes, that makes sense because the Fourteenth Amendment applies to state actions, and the Fair Housing Act also covers private parties, but I believe the Supreme Court has interpreted Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to allow Congress to regulate private conduct that violates the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nAdditionally, there might be an argument for using the Commerce Clause under Article I, but that's not one of the options here. The Commerce Clause allows Congress to regulate interstate commerce, and sometimes that's used to justify civil rights laws, but in this case, the options provided are focused on different parts of the Constitution.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option C, the enforcement provision of Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, would be the best rationale for Congress to pass a law prohibiting racial discrimination in real estate transactions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
