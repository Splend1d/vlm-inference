                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about conflict and integration models in the development of state societies. It's asking which option best describes the focus of these models in terms of tensions. The options are:\n\nA. external; internal\n\nB. military; religious\n\nC. internal; external\n\nD. extrafamilial; interfamilial\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"conflict models\" and \"integration models\" refer to in this context. I think conflict models are approaches that see conflict as a driving force in the evolution of societies, particularly in the formation of states. Similarly, integration models probably focus on the processes that bring people together and create cohesive social structures.\n\nSo, conflict models emphasize tensions that cause disagreements or struggles, leading to changes in society. Integration models, on the other hand, emphasize mechanisms that reduce tensions and promote cooperation.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the type of tensions each model emphasizes in the development of state societies. Specifically, it's asking whether conflict models focus on internal or external tensions, and whether integration models focus on the opposite.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, what do we mean by internal and external tensions?\n\nInternal tensions are likely those that arise from within the society itself, such as class struggles, power struggles among different groups, or conflicts over resources.\n\nExternal tensions would be those that come from outside the society, such as threats from other societies, invasions, or competition for territory and resources with neighboring groups.\n\nGiven that, conflict models might emphasize internal tensions because conflicts within a society, like class wars or power struggles, could lead to the concentration of power and the formation of a state apparatus to manage or suppress those conflicts.\n\nWait, but I've also heard of the theory that external threats can lead to the consolidation of power and the formation of states as a defensive mechanism. So, maybe conflict models could emphasize either internal or external tensions, depending on the specific theory.\n\nLet me consider specific examples.\n\nOne famous conflict model is the theory proposed by Karl Marx, which emphasizes class struggle as the driving force of historical development. In this model, the conflict between different social classes leads to revolutions and the rise of new forms of society, including the formation of states.\n\nSo, in this case, the conflict model is focusing on internal tensions\u2014class struggles within the society.\n\nOn the other hand, there are theories that suggest external threats, such as invasion or inter-societal competition, lead to the need for stronger central authority and thus the development of states.\n\nFor example, the \"barbarian invasion\" theory posits that the need to defend against external enemies led to the concentration of power and the formation of more organized, hierarchical societies.\n\nSo, in this case, the conflict model is focusing on external tensions.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Both seem to be conflict models, but one emphasizes internal tensions and the other emphasizes external tensions.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps conflict models, in general, emphasize conflict as a driver of change, but the nature of the conflict can be either internal or external.\n\nIntegration models, on the other hand, focus on factors that promote cooperation and unity, which could be in response to either internal or external tensions.\n\nWait, but the question is asking specifically about what each model emphasizes in terms of tensions.\n\nOption A is external; internal.\n\nOption C is internal; external.\n\nSo, if conflict models emphasize internal tensions and integration models emphasize external tensions, that would be option C.\n\nBut, based on what I just thought, conflict models can emphasize either internal or external tensions, so maybe that's not the best way to frame it.\n\nLet me look at it another way.\n\nMaybe conflict models see tensions, whether internal or external, as the driving force behind the development of state societies, while integration models see the resolution or management of those tensions as key.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking about the type of tensions each model emphasizes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps conflict models focus on conflicts that lead to the concentration of power, which could be due to internal struggles or external threats, while integration models focus on the processes that bind people together, possibly in response to external threats or internal disparities.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the primary focus of each model.\n\nConflict theories generally emphasize discord and competition as central to social change, whereas integration theories emphasize cohesion and cooperation.\n\nIn the context of state formation, conflict theories might focus on the ways in which conflicts within a society lead to the rise of a central authority to manage those conflicts, which would be internal tensions.\n\nIntegration theories might focus on the need for a society to unite against external threats, which would be external tensions.\n\nSo, in that case, conflict models emphasize internal tensions, and integration models emphasize external tensions.\n\nThat would correspond to option C: internal; external.\n\nBut earlier, I thought about the possibility that some conflict models emphasize external threats as the cause of conflict leading to state formation.\n\nLet me see if I can find some clarity here.\n\nPerhaps I should consider specific examples of conflict and integration models in the context of state formation.\n\nOne well-known conflict model is the class struggle approach, associated with Marx, which focuses on internal conflicts between different social classes.\n\nAnother conflict model is the theory that states form in response to external military threats, where the need to defend against invaders leads to the concentration of power and the establishment of a state apparatus.\n\nSo, in this case, conflict models can focus on either internal or external tensions.\n\nIntegration models, on the other hand, might focus on the need for cooperation and coordination, which could be driven by external threats or by internal economic interdependencies.\n\nThis seems a bit muddled. Maybe the question is trying to draw a distinction between conflict and integration models based on whether they emphasize internal or external tensions.\n\nOption A suggests conflict models emphasize external tensions and integration models emphasize internal tensions.\n\nOption C suggests conflict models emphasize internal tensions and integration models emphasize external tensions.\n\nGiven that some conflict models do focus on internal tensions (like class struggle) and some integration models focus on uniting against external threats, option C seems plausible.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nPerhaps conflict models, regardless of whether they emphasize internal or external tensions, see conflict as the primary driver of state formation, whereas integration models see integration or cooperation as the driving force.\n\nIn that case, the type of tension emphasized might not be as important as the process being emphasized\u2014conflict versus integration.\n\nBut the question specifically asks about the type of tensions each model emphasizes, not about the process itself.\n\nSo, perhaps conflict models emphasize internal tensions because they focus on conflicts within society, while integration models emphasize external tensions because they focus on uniting against outside threats.\n\nThat would again point towards option C: internal; external.\n\nAlternatively, maybe conflict models emphasize external tensions because external threats create conflicts that lead to state formation, while integration models emphasize resolving internal tensions to achieve cohesion.\n\nThat would point towards option A: external; internal.\n\nI'm getting conflicting thoughts here.\n\nLet me try to find some references or recall if there are specific theories that align with these options.\n\nI recall that in anthropological and sociological theories of state formation, there are indeed models that emphasize conflict and those that emphasize integration.\n\nFor example, the \"warfare theory\" or \"external threat theory\" suggests that states form in response to external military pressures, as groups need to organize to defend themselves or to wage war more effectively.\n\nThis would be a conflict model emphasizing external tensions.\n\nOn the other hand, the \"chiefdom theory\" or \"elite competition theory\" focuses on internal power struggles and the emergence of a central authority to manage those conflicts, which would be a conflict model emphasizing internal tensions.\n\nIntegration models might focus on the benefits of cooperation, such as improved resource management or enhanced social stability, which could be in response to external environmental challenges or internal economic needs.\n\nSo, again, it seems that conflict models can emphasize either internal or external tensions, depending on the specific theory.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe the question is trying to present a general characterization, and in that case, perhaps conflict models are more often associated with internal tensions, while integration models are associated with external tensions.\n\nFor example, many conflict theories in sociology focus on internal class struggles, while integration theories might focus on the need for a society to integrate in response to external environmental or security challenges.\n\nSo, in that sense, option C: internal; external, might be the correct choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the distinction is not as clear-cut, and different theories within each model emphasize different types of tensions.\n\nGiven that, maybe the question is expecting option C, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me consider the other options.\n\nOption B: military; religious.\n\nThis suggests that conflict models focus on military tensions, while integration models focus on religious tensions.\n\nWhile it's possible that some conflict models emphasize military conflicts, and some integration models emphasize religious unity, this seems too specific and not necessarily comprehensive of all conflict and integration models.\n\nSimilarly, option D: extrafamilial; interfamilial.\n\nExtrafamilial refers to relationships outside the family, and interfamilial refers to relationships within the family.\n\nWhile family structures can be important in social organization, I don't recall this being a primary distinction in models of state formation.\n\nTherefore, options B and D seem less likely to be correct.\n\nOption A: external; internal.\n\nIf I choose this, I would be saying that conflict models emphasize external tensions and integration models emphasize internal tensions.\n\nBut based on my earlier thinking, conflict models can emphasize either internal or external tensions, so this doesn't seem accurate.\n\nOption C: internal; external.\n\nThis seems more aligned with my understanding, where conflict models often focus on internal tensions leading to the formation of states, and integration models focus on external tensions prompting societies to integrate for common defense or other purposes.\n\nTherefore, I think option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
