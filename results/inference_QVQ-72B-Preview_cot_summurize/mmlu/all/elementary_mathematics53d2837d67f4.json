                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about a trapezoid-shaped field. The shorter base is 130 yards, the longer base is 390 yards, and the distance between the two bases is 75 yards. I need to find the area of the field. The options are 9,750 yards squared, 19,500 yards squared, 29,250 yards squared, and 39,000 yards squared.\n\nOkay, first things first, I remember that a trapezoid is a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides. In this case, the two bases are the parallel sides, right? So, the shorter base is 130 yards, and the longer one is 390 yards. The distance between them is 75 yards, which I think is the height of the trapezoid.\n\nI recall there's a formula for the area of a trapezoid. Let me think about it. Oh, yes! The area of a trapezoid is equal to the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides multiplied by the distance between them. So, it's (base1 + base2) divided by 2, all multiplied by the height.\n\nSo, in this problem, base1 is 130 yards, base2 is 390 yards, and the height is 75 yards.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nArea = (130 + 390) / 2 * 75\n\nFirst, I'll add 130 and 390. 130 plus 390 is 520.\n\nThen, divide that by 2: 520 / 2 = 260.\n\nNow, multiply by 75: 260 * 75.\n\nHmm, multiplying 260 by 75. Let's see, 200 * 75 is 15,000, and 60 * 75 is, let's see, 60 * 70 is 4,200, and 60 * 5 is 300, so total is 15,000 + 4,200 + 300 = 19,500.\n\nSo, the area should be 19,500 square yards.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 19,500 yards^2 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to approach this? Maybe I should double-check my calculations.\n\nLet me verify the addition: 130 + 390 is indeed 520.\n\nDividing by 2: 520 / 2 = 260.\n\nNow, multiplying 260 by 75.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of 260 * 70 + 260 * 5.\n\n260 * 70 is 18,200, and 260 * 5 is 1,300.\n\nAdding those together: 18,200 + 1,300 = 19,500.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is 19,500 yards squared.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{19500} \\]"
