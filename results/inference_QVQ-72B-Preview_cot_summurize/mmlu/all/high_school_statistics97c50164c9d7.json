                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a medical research team testing an experimental cancer drug at three different dosages to see if it reduces tumors in patients. They're looking at tumor reduction as the outcome. Now, I need to figure out which statement about explanatory and response variables is true in this context.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand what an explanatory variable and a response variable are. An explanatory variable is the one that might explain or cause changes in the response variable. So, in experimental studies, the explanatory variable is what's being manipulated to see if it affects the response variable.\n\nIn this case, the experimental cancer drug's dosage is likely the explanatory variable because it's what's being manipulated to see if it affects tumor reduction. Tumor reduction is probably the response variable because it's the outcome being measured to see if the drug is effective.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. There are three explanatory variables and one response variable.\n\nWait a minute, is there more than one explanatory variable here? The way the question is phrased, it seems like only one explanatory variable: the dosage of the drug, which has three different levels being tested. So, option A suggests there are three explanatory variables, but that doesn't seem right. Unless each dosage is considered a separate variable, but that doesn't make much sense in this context. Dosage is just one variable with three levels.\n\nB. There is one explanatory variable with three levels of response.\n\nHmm, this seems closer. There is one explanatory variable: dosage, and it has three different levels being tested. But the phrase \"levels of response\" is a bit confusing. Usually, we'd say the explanatory variable has three levels, and we observe the response to each level. So, perhaps this option is trying to say that there's one explanatory variable with three levels, and the response is tumor reduction. But the wording is a bit off.\n\nC. Tumor reduction is the only explanatory variable, but there are three response variables corresponding to the different dosages.\n\nThis seems upside down. If tumor reduction is the outcome being measured, that sounds more like the response variable, not the explanatory variable. And saying there are three response variables corresponding to the different dosages implies that each dosage has its own response, which isn't typical. Usually, you have one response variable measured at different levels of the explanatory variable.\n\nD. There are three levels of a single explanatory variable.\n\nThis seems accurate. There's one explanatory variable, which is the dosage of the drug, and it has three different levels being tested.\n\nGiven these options, option D seems to be the correct one. There's a single explanatory variable (dosage) with three levels being tested.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think about it again. In experimental design, the explanatory variable is the one being manipulated to see its effect on the response variable. Here, the drug dosage is being manipulated, and tumor reduction is being measured as the response. So, yes, dosage is the explanatory variable with three levels, and tumor reduction is the response variable.\n\nTherefore, option D is the true statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
