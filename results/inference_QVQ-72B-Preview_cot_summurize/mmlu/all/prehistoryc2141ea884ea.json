                    "text": "So I've got this question here about designs on rock faces. It says that a design which isn't painted but is etched into a rock face is called what? And there are four options: A. pictograph, B. petroglyph, C. pictorial, D. petrification.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to figure out which of these terms correctly describes a design that's etched into a rock face, meaning it's not painted on but somehow carved or engraved into the stone.\n\nFirst off, let's consider option A: pictograph. I think I've heard of pictographs before. They're like pictures or symbols painted or drawn on rocks, right? So, if they're painted or drawn, that doesn't match with being etched or carved into the rock. So, probably not the correct choice here.\n\nOption B: petroglyph. Hmm, this sounds familiar too. I believe petroglyphs are carvings made into rock surfaces. So, if they're carved, that would mean they're etched into the rock, which matches the description given in the question. That seems promising.\n\nOption C: pictorial. This sounds like it relates to pictures or images in general. But it doesn't specify anything about how the images are made on the rock\u2014whether they're painted or carved. So, it's probably too general and doesn't specifically answer the question about etching into rock faces.\n\nLastly, option D: petrification. I know that petrification has to do with turning something into stone, like when wood fossilizes over time and turns into stone. But that's not about designing or etching into rock faces. So, that doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like petroglyph is the correct term for a design that's etched or carved into a rock face, as opposed to being painted.\n\nWait a minute, just to make sure, let me think about this again. Pictographs are painted or drawn images on rocks, whereas petroglyphs are carved into the rock. So, yes, if the design is etched into the rock, that would be a petroglyph.\n\nAlso, petrification is a completely different process, involving the transformation of organic materials into stone, so that's not applicable here.\n\nAnd pictorial is just a general term for something depicted in pictures, which doesn't specify the method of creation on rock surfaces.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. petroglyph.\n\nJust to double-check, I recall that petroglyphs are prehistoric rock carvings found in many parts of the world, often created by ancient civilizations and indigenous people. They used various tools and techniques to carve symbols, animals, and other figures into rock faces. So, this aligns perfectly with the description of designs etched into rock.\n\nOn the other hand, pictographs are painted or drawn images, often found in caves or on rock surfaces, which again confirms that they are not the same as petroglyphs.\n\nSo, I'm confident that petroglyph is the correct term for the type of design described in the question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ petroglyph}} \\]"
