                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this expression: 2m + 7. And I need to choose which phrase describes it. The options are:\n\nA. 7 more than 2 times m\n\nB. 2 more than 7 times m\n\nC. 2 times the sum of 7 and m\n\nD. 7 times the sum of 2 and m\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what 2m + 7 really means. It's 2 times m, and then you add 7 to it. So, it's like taking m, doubling it, and then adding 7.\n\nLet me look at option A: 7 more than 2 times m. Hmm, that sounds similar. 2 times m is 2m, and then adding 7 more would be 2m + 7. That seems to match.\n\nOption B: 2 more than 7 times m. Wait, 7 times m is 7m, and then adding 2 would be 7m + 2. That's different from 2m + 7. So, that's not the same.\n\nOption C: 2 times the sum of 7 and m. So, first, you add 7 and m, and then multiply by 2. That would be 2(m + 7), which expands to 2m + 14. That's not the same as 2m + 7.\n\nOption D: 7 times the sum of 2 and m. So, first, you add 2 and m, and then multiply by 7. That would be 7(m + 2), which is 7m + 14. Again, not the same as 2m + 7.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems to match the expression 2m + 7. But let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nOption A says \"7 more than 2 times m.\" So, 2 times m is 2m, and then adding 7 more would indeed be 2m + 7. That matches perfectly.\n\nOption B is 2 more than 7 times m, which is 7m + 2. That's different.\n\nOption C is 2 times the sum of 7 and m, which is 2(m + 7) = 2m + 14. Not the same.\n\nOption D is 7 times the sum of 2 and m, which is 7(m + 2) = 7m + 14. Different again.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is option A: 7 more than 2 times m.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any other way to interpret the phrases. For example, does \"more than\" always mean addition, and \"times\" mean multiplication? Yes, in this context, that's how they're used.\n\nAlso, \"the sum of\" means addition, and \"times the sum\" means multiplying by the result of the addition.\n\nSo, I think my initial conclusion is correct. Option A is the right description of 2m + 7.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any ambiguity in the phrasing.\n\nIn option A, \"7 more than 2 times m\" could be interpreted as 7 + (2 * m), which is 2m + 7.\n\nOption B, \"2 more than 7 times m,\" could be 2 + (7 * m), which is 7m + 2.\n\nOption C, \"2 times the sum of 7 and m,\" is unambiguous as 2 * (7 + m), which is 2m + 14.\n\nOption D, \"7 times the sum of 2 and m,\" is 7 * (2 + m), which is 7m + 14.\n\nNo ambiguity there. So, the answer remains option A.\n\nI think that's it. The phrase that describes 2m + 7 is \"7 more than 2 times m.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
