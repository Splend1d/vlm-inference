                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I've got this set: {2/5, 1/2, 5, 10}, and I need to find the greatest possible quotient when I divide any two distinct numbers from this set. So, I need to maximize x/y, where x and y are different elements from this set.\n\nFirst, I should understand what it means to maximize the quotient. The quotient x/y is maximized when the numerator x is as large as possible and the denominator y is as small as possible. So, ideally, I want the largest number in the set divided by the smallest number in the set.\n\nLet me identify the largest and smallest numbers in the set.\n\nThe numbers are: 2/5, 1/2, 5, and 10.\n\nI need to compare these fractions and whole numbers. To do that, I should convert all of them to decimals to make it easier.\n\nLet's convert:\n\n- 2/5 = 0.4\n\n- 1/2 = 0.5\n\n- 5 = 5.0\n\n- 10 = 10.0\n\nSo, the smallest number is 0.4 (which is 2/5), and the largest is 10.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible quotient should be 10 divided by 0.4.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n10 \u00f7 0.4 = 25\n\nSo, according to this, the greatest possible quotient is 25.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there are any other pairs that could give a larger quotient. Maybe dividing 10 by something smaller than 0.4, but in this set, 0.4 is the smallest number. Alternatively, maybe dividing a smaller number by a larger one could somehow give a larger quotient, but that doesn't seem likely because dividing a smaller number by a larger one would give a quotient less than 1, which is smaller than 25.\n\nLet me consider all possible pairs to be sure.\n\nList all possible pairs (x, y) where x \u2260 y:\n\n1. (2/5, 1/2)\n\n2. (2/5, 5)\n\n3. (2/5, 10)\n\n4. (1/2, 5)\n\n5. (1/2, 10)\n\n6. (5, 10)\n\nNow, calculate the quotient x/y for each pair.\n\nUsing decimals for ease:\n\n1. 0.4 \u00f7 0.5 = 0.8\n\n2. 0.4 \u00f7 5 = 0.08\n\n3. 0.4 \u00f7 10 = 0.04\n\n4. 0.5 \u00f7 5 = 0.1\n\n5. 0.5 \u00f7 10 = 0.05\n\n6. 5 \u00f7 10 = 0.5\n\nNow, the reciprocals (y/x) for each pair:\n\n1. 0.5 \u00f7 0.4 = 1.25\n\n2. 5 \u00f7 0.4 = 12.5\n\n3. 10 \u00f7 0.4 = 25\n\n4. 5 \u00f7 0.5 = 10\n\n5. 10 \u00f8 0.5 = 20\n\n6. 10 \u00f7 5 = 2\n\nNow, listing all possible quotients:\n\n0.8, 0.08, 0.04, 0.1, 0.05, 0.5, 1.25, 12.5, 25, 10, 20, 2\n\nThe highest value among these is 25.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's confirm if there are any other pairs or considerations I might have missed.\n\nLooking back at the original approach, I considered all distinct pairs and calculated both x/y and y/x for each pair, ensuring I covered all possibilities.\n\nAdditionally, I considered the general principle that to maximize x/y, I should choose x as large as possible and y as small as possible, which aligns with choosing x=10 and y=0.4, giving x/y=25.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the greatest possible quotient is 25.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 5\n\nB. 10\n\nC. 20\n\nD. 25\n\nThe correct answer is D. 25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]"
