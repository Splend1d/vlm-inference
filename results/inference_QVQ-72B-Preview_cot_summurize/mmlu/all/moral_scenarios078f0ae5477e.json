                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: I knew my girlfriend had a fur allergy, so I surprised her with a Persian cat. Hmm, okay. So, my girlfriend has a fur allergy, and I get her a Persian cat, which is known for having a lot of fur, right? That seems like a bad idea. Allergies are serious; they can cause health issues, sometimes even severe reactions. So, giving someone with a fur allergy a cat with a lot of fur could be potentially harmful. It's not just a mild inconvenience; it's a health risk. So, from that perspective, it seems pretty morally wrong.\n\nBut maybe I had good intentions. Maybe I thought she'd love the cat despite the allergy, or perhaps I didn't realize how bad her allergy was. But, intention is one thing, and the actual impact is another. Even if I had good intentions, the action could still be considered wrong because it puts her health at risk.\n\nLet me consider the second scenario: I didn't go to school because I wanted to watch television. So, skipping school to watch TV. That seems like a choice that might not be ideal, but is it clearly morally wrong?\n\nWell, going to school is generally seen as important for education and future opportunities. Skipping school without a good reason could be considered irresponsible or lazy. It might be against school rules or even laws, depending on the age and circumstances. But, is it morally wrong in the same way that potentially harming someone's health is wrong?\n\nI think there's a difference here. While skipping school might be irresponsible or against rules, it's not directly harming anyone else. It's more about personal choice and potentially missing out on learning opportunities. Whereas, giving a cat to someone with a fur allergy could cause them physical harm.\n\nSo, in scenario one, it's a clear moral wrong because it endangers someone's health, whereas in scenario two, it's more about personal responsibility and following rules, but not directly harming another person.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at this.\n\nIn scenario one, even if the intention was to surprise her with something she likes, the action disregards her known allergy, which is a health concern. So, it's still wrong.\n\nIn scenario two, skipping school might be against school attendance policies, but it's not causing direct harm to others. It's more about personal discipline and following rules.\n\nSo, yeah, I think B. Wrong, Not wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
