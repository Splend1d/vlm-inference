                    "text": "Let's tackle this logic problem using indirect truth tables. The goal is to determine whether the set of propositions is consistent. The propositions given are:\n\n1. D \u2261 E (D is equivalent to E)\n\n2. F \u2228 D (F or D)\n\n3. ~E \u00b7 ~F (not E and not F)\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a set of propositions to be consistent. A set of propositions is consistent if there is at least one possible truth value assignment to the variables that makes all the propositions true simultaneously.\n\nSo, my task is to find if there's a combination of truth values for D, E, and F that satisfies all three propositions at the same time.\n\nLet's start by listing the propositions again for clarity:\n\n1. D \u2261 E\n\n2. F \u2228 D\n\n3. ~E \u00b7 ~F\n\nI'll begin by considering the possible truth values for D and E due to the first proposition, D \u2261 E.\n\nThe biconditional (\u2261) means that D and E must have the same truth value. So, either both are true or both are false.\n\nCase 1: D is true and E is true.\n\nCase 2: D is false and E is false.\n\nNow, let's consider each case and see if they can satisfy the other two propositions.\n\nStarting with Case 1: D is true and E is true.\n\nLooking at the second proposition: F \u2228 D. Since D is true, F \u2228 D is true regardless of F's value. So, this proposition is satisfied in this case, no matter what F is.\n\nNext, the third proposition: ~E \u00b7 ~F. Since E is true, ~E is false. So, ~E \u00b7 ~F is false (because false \u00b7 anything is false). But for the set to be consistent, all propositions need to be true simultaneously. Here, the third proposition is false, which is a problem.\n\nTherefore, Case 1 does not work because we can't satisfy the third proposition when D and E are both true.\n\nNow, let's consider Case 2: D is false and E is false.\n\nLooking at the second proposition: F \u2228 D. Since D is false, the truth of this proposition depends on F. So, F \u2228 D is true if F is true or false; it's only false if both are false. Wait, if D is false, then F \u2228 D is true if F is true, and false if F is false.\n\nBut I need to ensure that all propositions are true, so F \u2228 D must be true. Therefore, F must be true.\n\nNow, with D false, E false, and F true, let's check the third proposition: ~E \u00b7 ~F.\n\n~E is true (since E is false), and ~F is false (since F is true). So, ~E \u00b7 ~F is true \u00b7 false = false.\n\nAgain, this makes the third proposition false, which is not acceptable for consistency.\n\nIt seems like in both cases, the third proposition ends up being false. This suggests that there is no assignment of truth values to D, E, and F that makes all three propositions true at the same time.\n\nHowever, I should double-check my reasoning to make sure I haven't missed something.\n\nIn Case 1:\n\n- D \u2261 E: both true\n\n- F \u2228 D: true (since D is true)\n\n- ~E \u00b7 ~F: false (since E is true, ~E is false)\n\nIn Case 2:\n\n- D \u2261 E: both false\n\n- F \u2228 D: true only if F is true\n\n- ~E \u00b7 ~F: true only if both ~E and ~F are true, which requires E false and F false\n\nBut in Case 2, if F is true, then ~F is false, making the third proposition false.\n\nIf F is false, then ~F is true, but F \u2228 D would be false (since D is false and F is false), which violates the second proposition.\n\nSo, indeed, there seems to be no way to satisfy all three propositions simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the set of propositions is inconsistent.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Inconsistent\n\nB. Consistent. Consistent valuation when D, E, and F are true\n\nC. Consistent. Consistent valuation when D and E are true and F is false\n\nD. Consistent. Consistent valuation when D and F are true and E is false\n\nGiven my analysis, option A seems correct, as there is no consistent valuation that satisfies all propositions simultaneously.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any assignment that could work.\n\nSuppose D and E are both true (Case 1):\n\n- D \u2261 E: true\n\n- F \u2228 D: true (if D is true)\n\n- ~E \u00b7 ~F: false (since E is true)\n\nNot consistent.\n\nSuppose D and E are both false (Case 2):\n\n- D \u2261 E: true\n\n- F \u2228 D: true only if F is true\n\n- ~E \u00b7 ~F: true only if F is false\n\nSo, if F is true, then ~F is false, making the third proposition false.\n\nIf F is false, then ~F is true, but F \u2228 D is false (since both F and D are false), making the second proposition false.\n\nNo good.\n\nAlternatively, suppose D is true, E is true, and F is true (option B):\n\n- D \u2261 E: true\n\n- F \u2228 D: true\n\n- ~E \u00b7 ~F: false\n\nNot consistent.\n\nOption C: D and E true, F false:\n\n- D \u2261 E: true\n\n- F \u2228 D: true (since D is true)\n\n- ~E \u00b7 ~F: false (since E is true)\n\nNot consistent.\n\nOption D: D and F true, E false:\n\n- D \u2261 E: false (since D is true and E is false)\n\n- F \u2228 D: true\n\n- ~E \u00b7 ~F: false (since F is true, ~F is false)\n\nNot consistent.\n\nTherefore, none of the supposed consistent valuations actually work, and the set is indeed inconsistent.\n\nSo, the answer is A. Inconsistent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
