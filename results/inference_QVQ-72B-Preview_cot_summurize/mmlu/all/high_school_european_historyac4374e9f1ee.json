Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the \u0153cumenical position, the \u0153cumenical traditions, of Rome&\u2026.\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\nEdward A.

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this passage to read and understand. It's from Edward A. Freeman's \"The Chief Periods of European History\" from 1885. The topic seems to be about the unification of Italy and how it's affected Rome and other parts of Italy, like Sicily. I need to figure out what traditions the author is lamenting the loss of in Rome, and the options are lingual, religious, economic, or artistic.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand the context. The unification of Italy, or Risorgimento, was a movement in the 19th century that led to the consolidation of different states into a single Italian nation. This process was completed in 1870 with the annexation of Rome, which became the capital of the new kingdom of Italy.\n\nThe passage mentions that Sicily, which was once an independent kingdom, is now just seven provinces of the mainland kingdom. The author seems to regret that this historic entity has lost its distinct identity, even its name, in the process of unification. He says, \"it jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression.\"\n\nNext, the author talks about Rome and its role in European history. He refers to Rome as the \"centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds,\" meaning it was the head of a local Italian kingdom. But with Italian unification, Rome became just the capital of Italy, losing its \"\u0153cumenical position\" and \"\u0153cumenical traditions.\" The term \"\u0153cumenical\" generally refers to the universal Christian church, so this suggests that Rome had a special status related to Christianity that was diminished by becoming part of a national state.\n\nThe author also mentions that the entry of the Italian army into Rome \"formally swept away the \u0153cumenical position, the \u0153cumenical traditions, of Rome.\" This seems to indicate that the unification process ended Rome's role as a universal center of Christianity, at least in a political sense.\n\nFurthermore, the passage states that by becoming the capital of Italy, Rome has \"cast aside her Imperial traditions\" that were not cast aside when Rome was under French rule as a department. This implies that the Imperial traditions being referred to are connected to Rome's status as the center of the Roman Empire and perhaps its subsequent role in European history.\n\nSo, to summarize, the author is lamenting the loss of Rome's \u0153cumenical position and Imperial traditions due to Italian unification.\n\nNow, I need to match this to one of the options: lingual, religious, economic, or artistic.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Lingual: This relates to language. While Rome and Italy have a rich linguistic history, especially with Latin being the foundation of many European languages, the passage doesn't specifically mention language as the lost tradition. So, maybe not the primary focus here.\n\nB. Religious: This seems plausible because of the reference to Rome's \u0153cumenical position and traditions, which are closely tied to Christianity and the Roman Catholic Church. Rome is the seat of the papacy, and its role in Christianity is undeniably significant. The unification of Italy might have altered Rome's status in this context.\n\nC. Economic: The passage doesn't directly discuss economic traditions or changes resulting from unification. While economic aspects are always part of historical changes, they aren't the main focus here.\n\nD. Artistic: Rome is famous for its art and architecture, from ancient times through the Renaissance and beyond. However, the passage doesn't specifically mention artistic traditions being lost due to unification.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most fitting answer seems to be B. Religious, because the passage emphasizes Rome's \u0153cumenical position and traditions, which are fundamentally religious in nature, particularly related to Christianity.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check. The term \"\u0153cumenical\" primarily refers to the universal Christian church, so it's directly related to religious aspects. Additionally, the reference to Rome casting aside her Imperial traditions could also be related to her religious role, as the Roman Empire was Christianized under Constantine, and the papacy has had a significant Imperial-like influence in European history.\n\nMoreover, the fact that Rome is now the capital of a secular nation-state might indeed signify a shift away from its traditional religious centrality.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct answer is B. Religious.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
