                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about self-monitoring. It says that a person who is low in self-monitoring will rely on which of the following when deciding how to act in a particular social situation. The options are:\n\nA. his/her life scripts.\n\nB. his/her own feelings, attitudes, and beliefs.\n\nC. the emotional reactions and behaviors of the people he/she is interacting with.\n\nD. internal working models that were acquired during infancy and early childhood.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what low self-monitoring means. I did a quick search, and it seems that self-monitoring is a concept developed by Mark Snyder, as mentioned in the question from 1987. Self-monitoring refers to how much people pay attention to their external environment and adjust their behavior based on situational cues.\n\nFrom what I've read, high self-monitors are more likely to adjust their behavior to fit the situation, perhaps being more aware of social cues and changing their behavior to fit in or impress others. On the other hand, low self-monitors are less likely to change their behavior based on the situation; instead, they tend to behave in ways that are consistent with their own internal states and traits.\n\nSo, if someone is low in self-monitoring, they're more likely to rely on their own feelings, attitudes, and beliefs when deciding how to act in a social situation, rather than looking at what others are doing or what the situation dictates.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. his/her life scripts.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what \"life scripts\" refer to in this context. Maybe they're like personal narratives or expected sequences of events in life, but I'm not sure how that directly relates to deciding how to act in a specific social situation.\n\nB. his/her own feelings, attitudes, and beliefs.\n\nThis seems to align with what I understand about low self-monitors. They tend to rely on their internal states rather than external cues.\n\nC. the emotional reactions and behaviors of the people he/she is interacting with.\n\nThis sounds more like what high self-monitors would do, as they are more attuned to the behavior and emotions of others and adjust their behavior accordingly.\n\nD. internal working models that were acquired during infancy and early childhood.\n\nInternal working models are typically associated with attachment theory, referring to mental representations of relationships and expectations about bonds with others. While these might influence social behavior, I'm not sure if this is the primary factor that low self-monitors rely on when deciding how to act in a social situation.\n\nGiven this, option B seems the most appropriate answer. Low self-monitors are more likely to rely on their own feelings, attitudes, and beliefs when deciding how to act in a social situation.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it a bit more. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nFor example, option A, life scripts, might be relevant in some way. Maybe low self-monitors follow certain scripts or expected behaviors based on their cultural or familial backgrounds. However, I think that's more related to high self-monitors who might follow social norms and expectations more closely.\n\nOption C is about responding to others' emotions and behaviors. As I mentioned earlier, this seems more aligned with high self-monitors, who are more sensitive to social cues and adjust their behavior accordingly.\n\nOption D refers to internal working models, which are primarily about early attachments and relationships. While these models can influence social behavior, I don't think they're the primary factor that low self-monitors rely on in every social situation.\n\nTherefore, I still think that option B is the best answer. Low self-monitors rely on their own feelings, attitudes, and beliefs when deciding how to act in a social situation.\n\nJust to double-check, I found a definition that says low self-monitors are characterized by a consistent expression of their true attitudes and feelings across different situations. They are less concerned with how others perceive them and more focused on being true to themselves.\n\nThis directly supports the idea that they rely on their own internal states rather than external factors.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. his/her own feelings, attitudes, and beliefs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
