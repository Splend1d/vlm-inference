                    "text": "So I've got this question about independent regulatory agencies and how Congress tries to protect them from political influence. The options are:\n\nA. Be led by a group of commissioners representing both major political parties\n\nB. Plan policy cooperatively with the appropriate congressional committees\n\nC. Reapply for funding at the end of each fiscal year\n\nD. Submit all planned policy changes to the president for approval\n\nI need to figure out which one of these is a method Congress uses to protect these agencies from political influence.\n\nFirst, I should understand what an independent regulatory agency is. These are government agencies created by Congress to carry out specific regulatory functions. They're supposed to be independent, meaning they're not directly controlled by the President or other elected officials, which helps insulate them from political pressure.\n\nNow, the question is about protecting these agencies from political influence. So, I need to think about which of these options would help maintain their independence.\n\nOption A says that each agency should be led by a group of commissioners representing both major political parties. This sounds like a good way to ensure that no single party has complete control over the agency. By having commissioners from both parties, there might be more balanced decision-making and less likelihood of partisan policies being imposed.\n\nOption B suggests that the agencies should plan policy cooperatively with the appropriate congressional committees. While it's important for agencies to coordinate with Congress, especially since Congress oversees them, this might not necessarily protect them from political influence. In fact, if Congress is exerting too much control over policy planning, it could be seen as encroaching on the agency's independence.\n\nOption C mentions that agencies should reapply for funding at the end of each fiscal year. This seems like it could be a way for Congress to keep tabs on the agencies and ensure they're using funds appropriately. However, having to reapply for funding annually could also be seen as a way to exert pressure on the agencies, as their continued operation depends on congressional approval. This might not protect them from political influence; quite the opposite, it could be a tool for Congress to influence agency actions.\n\nOption D says that agencies should submit all planned policy changes to the president for approval. This seems directly at odds with maintaining independence. If the president has to approve all policy changes, then the agencies are subject to the president's political agenda, which undermines their independence.\n\nSo, comparing these options, option A seems to be the one that best protects the agencies from political influence by ensuring bipartisan representation in leadership positions. This approach helps to balance power and prevent any one political party from dominating the agency's decisions.\n\nLet me think a bit more about this. Is there any chance that requiring bipartisan representation could actually lead to political influence? For example, if commissioners are appointed based on their party affiliation, they might be more inclined to follow party lines rather than act independently. However, the idea is that by having representation from both parties, decisions would need to be agreed upon by members from different political backgrounds, potentially leading to more centrist or compromise positions.\n\nOn the other hand, option B, planning policy cooperatively with congressional committees, could be seen as a way to ensure that the agency's policies align with congressional intent. But it could also be a way for Congress to micromanage the agency, influencing day-to-day decisions beyond their oversight role.\n\nOption C, reapplying for funding annually, is a common practice for many government agencies. While it can ensure accountability, it can also create uncertainty and make long-term planning difficult if funding is not secured. This uncertainty could make agencies more prone to political influence as they try to please Congress to secure their budgets.\n\nOption D, submitting policy changes to the president, directly contradicts the idea of independence. The president is an elected official and has their own political agenda, so having final say over agency policies would mean that the agencies are not truly independent.\n\nTherefore, after considering all the options, I believe that option A is the correct answer. Requiring that each agency be led by a group of commissioners representing both major political parties is a measure that Congress has used to protect independent regulatory agencies from political influence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
