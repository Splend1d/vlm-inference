A. beans, B. peas, C. radishes, D. peanuts.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one doesn't belong to the legume family.\n\nFirst off, I know that legumes are a type of plant in the Fabaceae family, and they're characterized by their pods that split along both sides when they open. They're also known for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, which is pretty cool.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with beans. I know that beans are definitely legumes. There are so many varieties, like kidney beans, pinto beans, green beans, and so on. They all grow in pods that split open when they're ripe, revealing the beans inside. So, A. beans is definitely a legume.\n\nNext, peas. Peas are another common food that comes to mind when thinking of legumes. Sweet peas, snow peas, and sugar snap peas are all types of peas. They also grow in pods that split open to reveal the peas inside. So, B. peas are also legumes.\n\nNow, C. radishes. Hmm, radishes are root vegetables, right? They're part of the Brassicaceae family, which is the same family as cabbage and turnips. They don't grow in pods like beans and peas do. Instead, they have a fleshy root that's usually red or white. So, based on that, radishes don't seem to be legumes.\n\nLastly, D. peanuts. Peanuts are interesting. They're actually legumes too. They belong to the Fabaceae family, just like beans and peas. Their fruits develop underground, which might make them seem different, but they're still considered legumes. The nuts we eat are the seeds of the peanut plant.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nA. beans \u2013 legumes\n\nB. peas \u2013 legumes\n\nC. radishes \u2013 not legumes\n\nD. peanuts \u2013 legumes\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. radishes.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"Which of these are not legumes?\" and lists beans, peas, radishes, and peanuts. Based on my knowledge, beans, peas, and peanuts are all legumes, while radishes are not. So, radishes are the odd one out.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I should consider if there are any exceptions or special cases. For example, are all types of beans considered legumes? Yes, as far as I know. Peas are definitely legumes. Radishes are definitely not. And peanuts, despite growing underground, are indeed legumes.\n\nSo, I'm confident that radishes are not legumes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. radishes}} \\]"
