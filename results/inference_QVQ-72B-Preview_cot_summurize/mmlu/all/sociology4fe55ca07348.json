                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Marx and his views on religion. It says that Marx proclaimed that religion would disappear when... and then there are four options. I need to pick the correct one. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Marx believed about religion. I remember that Marx called religion the \"opiate of the masses.\" He thought that religion was something that kept people content with their suffering by promising a better life after death or something like that. So, basically, it was a way for the ruling class to control the working class.\n\nNow, the question is about when religion would disappear according to Marx. Let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says that religion would disappear when a new trend of moral individualism became established. Hmm, moral individualism sounds interesting. I think it means that people start making their own moral choices rather than following set rules from religion. But is this something Marx specifically said would lead to the disappearance of religion? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's related to his ideas, but I don't recall him saying this directly.\n\nOption B says that religion would disappear when a socialist revolution removed the need for capitalist ideology. Now, this sounds more familiar. Marx was all about the proletariat rising up against the bourgeoisie, the working class overthrowing the capitalist system. He believed that under capitalism, religion was a tool to keep the workers in line. So, if there was a socialist revolution that ended capitalism, maybe religion would no longer be necessary as a tool of control. That seems plausible.\n\nOption C says that religion would disappear when church attendance dropped below 15%. Well, this seems too specific and not really aligned with Marx's theories. Marx wasn't focused on attendance percentages; he was more concerned with the economic base and how it shapes society's superstructure, including religion. So, I doubt this is the correct answer.\n\nOption D says that religion would disappear when people came to believe more in science and technology. While it's true that Marx lived during the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution periods, where science was beginning to challenge traditional religious beliefs, I don't think this is the core of his argument. Marx's critique of religion was more about its role in maintaining class oppression rather than a conflict between science and religion.\n\nLet me think about this again. Marx saw religion as a false consciousness, a way that the working class was being misled into accepting their poor conditions. He believed that once the working class realized this and overthrew the capitalist system, the conditions that gave rise to religion would disappear.\n\nSo, in that case, option B seems to align closely with Marx's thoughts. A socialist revolution would overthrow capitalism, and with it, the need for religion as a tool to pacify the working class would vanish.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any direct quote or specific reference from Marx that supports this. I remember something about the \"withering away of the state\" in communist society, but I'm not sure if he specifically said religion would disappear at that point.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about it differently. Marx was a materialist, meaning he believed that economic conditions shape society's ideas and ideologies, including religion. So, if the economic system changes fundamentally through a socialist revolution, then the basis for religion would be removed, and it would eventually disappear.\n\nThat makes sense. So, option B seems to be the most accurate among the given choices.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's quickly revisit the other options.\n\nOption A: Moral individualism. While individualism is a concept in philosophy and sociology, I don't recall Marx linking it directly to the disappearance of religion. He was more concerned with class consciousness and economic determinism.\n\nOption C: Church attendance dropping below 15%. This seems arbitrary and not grounded in Marx's theories. Attendance figures wouldn't necessarily relate to his analysis of class struggle and the role of religion in it.\n\nOption D: Belief in science and technology. While science and technology were advancing during Marx's time, and while there might be a general trend away from religious explanations towards scientific ones, this isn't central to Marx's critique of religion. His main issue was with religion as a tool of oppression and false consciousness under capitalism.\n\nTherefore, after considering all the options, I believe the correct answer is option B: a socialist revolution removes the need for capitalist ideology.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
