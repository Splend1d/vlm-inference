                    "text": "So Carol Collector is an antique car enthusiast, specifically interested in Thunderbirds in good condition. She came across a newspaper ad for a 1964 Thunderbird sports coupe priced at $25,000. The ad also provided a website link to view a picture of the car, which showed a T-Bird with a perfect body and interior. Carol proceeded to pay the $25,000 and signed a sales contract that specified the Thunderbird was \"used and sold as is.\"\n\nWhen she went to pick up the car, she discovered that it was actually a 1968 model, which is less rare and therefore worth less than the advertised 1964 model. As a result, Carol is considering legal action against the seller. The question is, what is the likely outcome if Carol brings a suit against the seller?\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Carol, because the internet picture was of a car that had never been driven, not the actual used car she was to buy.\n\nThis option suggests that the picture on the website was misleading because it showed a brand-new car, whereas the actual car being sold was used. If this is the case, it could be considered deceptive advertising, and Carol might have grounds for a lawsuit based on misrepresentation.\n\nB. The seller, because the buyer was aware the Thunderbird was sold \"as is.\"\n\nThis option points out that the sales contract included an \"as is\" clause, which typically means that the buyer accepts the item in its current condition, without any warranty from the seller. This could potentially limit the seller's liability for any defects or misrepresentations about the car's condition.\n\nC. The seller, unless they were negligent in not explicitly stating the picture was of a new car, not the actual car to be sold.\n\nThis option seems to suggest that unless the seller was negligent in not clarifying that the picture was of a new car and not the actual used car being sold, the seller would prevail. However, this might not be entirely accurate, as misrepresentation could still be an issue even if the picture was of a new car.\n\nD. Carol, because the \"as is\" disclosure was not totally effective.\n\nThis option implies that the \"as is\" clause in the contract may not completely protect the seller from all forms of liability, particularly if there was fraud or intentional misrepresentation involved in the sale.\n\nNow, let's consider the relevant legal principles. In contract law, misrepresentation occurs when one party makes a false statement of fact that induces the other party to enter into the contract. If this misrepresentation is material (i.e., it goes to the essence of the contract), the aggrieved party may have grounds to rescind the contract or seek damages.\n\nIn this scenario, the seller advertised a 1964 Thunderbird and provided a picture of a perfect T-Bird, but delivered a 1968 model instead. There is a clear discrepancy between what was advertised and what was delivered. The year of the car is a significant factor in determining its value, especially since collectible cars can vary widely in price based on their model year.\n\nThe \"as is\" clause in the contract states that the car is sold in its current condition without any warranty. However, this clause does not absolve the seller of liability for fraudulent misrepresentation or intentional deception. If the seller knowingly misrepresented the car's model year to induce Carol to buy it, this could constitute fraud, which is not excused by an \"as is\" disclaimer.\n\nAdditionally, if the picture on the website was intended to represent the actual car being sold but did not, this could be considered negligent misrepresentation, where the seller failed to exercise reasonable care in ensuring that the representation was accurate.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems that Carol has a strong case against the seller. The fact that the car was sold \"as is\" might not protect the seller if Carol can prove that the seller intentionally deceived her about the car's model year.\n\nTherefore, the likely outcome is that Carol would prevail in her suit against the seller. Among the given options, D. Carol, because the \"as is\" disclosure was not totally effective, seems to be the most accurate.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the exact outcome would depend on the specific laws of the jurisdiction where the sale took place and the evidence presented in court. But based on the information provided, option D appears to be the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
