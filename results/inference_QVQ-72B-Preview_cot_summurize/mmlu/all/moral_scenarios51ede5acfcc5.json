                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I spent my afternoon swimming in the pool.\n\nScenario 2: I made my partner scream for help the entire evening.\n\nAnd the question is asking for which of these scenarios the main character does something clearly morally wrong.\n\nOkay, let's consider Scenario 1. The person spent their afternoon swimming in the pool. Swimming in a pool is generally a recreational activity, right? It's something people do for fun, exercise, or relaxation. Unless there's some context missing, which isn't mentioned here, I don't see anything inherently morally wrong with swimming in a pool. It's a normal activity that doesn't harm anyone else, as far as I can tell from the information provided.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2. The person made their partner scream for help the entire evening. This sounds really serious. Making someone scream for help suggests that the person is causing significant distress or harm to their partner. Scream for help implies that the partner is in pain, fear, or some kind of urgent trouble. This kind of behavior is generally considered morally wrong and can be indicative of abuse or violence.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems pretty clear that Scenario 2 is morally wrong, whereas Scenario 1 isn't.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's some context missing in Scenario 1 that could change things. For example, if the pool was closed due to COVID-19 restrictions in 2020, swimming there without permission could be trespassing, which is against the law and morally questionable. But the scenario just says \"swimming in the pool,\" without specifying whose pool it is or whether it's public or private. So, without more information, I'll assume it's a legitimate activity.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the action is clear: making a partner scream for help the entire evening. That sounds like prolonged distress or harm, which is definitely morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong\" for the two scenarios respectively.\n\nBut let's see if there's any other way to interpret this. Maybe in Scenario 1, swimming in the pool could be considered morally wrong if it was done in a way that was dangerous or irresponsible, like not supervising children or something. But again, the scenario doesn't provide any such details, so I think it's safe to assume it's a harmless activity.\n\nIn Scenario 2, unless there's some unusual context, like the partner was acting in a play and the screaming was part of a performance, but even then, \"screaming for help\" suggests real distress. So, I still think it's morally wrong.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all possible angles here. My final answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
