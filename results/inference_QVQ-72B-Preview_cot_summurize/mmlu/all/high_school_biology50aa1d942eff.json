                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about species interactions. It says that one species benefits while the other is unaffected, and I need to choose which term describes this relationship: parasitism, mutualism, commensalism, or symbiosis.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these terms means. Starting with parasitism, I remember that in parasitism, one organism, the parasite, benefits at the expense of another organism, the host. So, in this case, the parasite gets something it needs, like food or shelter, from the host, and the host is harmed in some way. But the question here says that one species benefits while the other is unaffected. That doesn't sound like parasitism because in parasitism, the host is definitely affected negatively.\n\nNext is mutualism. I think mutualism is when both species benefit from the interaction. Like, for example, bees and flowers. Bees get nectar from flowers, and flowers get pollinated by the bees. So, both sides benefit. But the question says that one species benefits while the other is unaffected. That doesn't match mutualism because in mutualism, both species are affected positively.\n\nThen there's commensalism. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this one. I think commensalism is when one species benefits and the other neither benefits nor is harmed. That sounds a lot like what the question is describing: one species benefits while the other is unaffected. So, maybe this is the answer.\n\nBut wait, there's also symbiosis. I recall that symbiosis is a close and long-term interaction between different species. It can include mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism. So, symbiosis is kind of a broad term that encompasses these other types of interactions. The question might be looking for a more specific type of interaction rather than the general term symbiosis.\n\nLet me double-check. If symbiosis is the general term for any close interaction between species, then saying \"symbiosis\" might be too broad for this question. The question seems to be asking for a specific type of interaction where one species benefits and the other is unaffected.\n\nMaybe I should consider an example to help me understand. Suppose there's a plant growing near a rock. The plant might use the rock for support, which benefits the plant by giving it stability, but the rock isn't really affected one way or the other. So, in this case, the plant benefits, and the rock is unaffected. This sounds like commensalism.\n\nAnother example could be certain bacteria living in the digestive tracts of animals. These bacteria might benefit by having a place to live and food to eat, while the animal host isn't significantly affected. Again, this seems like commensalism.\n\nWait a minute, but I think there are different types of commensalism. Is there any chance that the other options could also fit the description of one species benefiting while the other is unaffected?\n\nLet's think about parasitism again. In parasitism, one species benefits, but the other is harmed. So, it's not a case of being unaffected; the host is negatively impacted. So, that doesn't match the question's description.\n\nWhat about mutualism? In mutualism, both species benefit, which again doesn't match the \"one benefits while the other is unaffected\" scenario.\n\nSymbiosis, as I said earlier, is a general term that includes mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism. So, it's too broad for this specific situation.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer should be commensalism.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check an online source or a textbook to confirm. Oh, wait, I'm doing this online, so maybe I can look up the definition of commensalism.\n\nOkay, according to my research, commensalism is a type of species interaction where one species benefits while the other neither benefits nor is harmed. That matches exactly with the question's description: one species benefits while the other is unaffected.\n\nSo, I'm confident that commensalism is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. commensalism.}} \\]"
