                    "text": "So I've got this question here about economic growth based on real GDP per capita. It says that in 1990, the real GDP per capita was $10,000, and in 2000, it was $15,000. I need to find out the amount of economic growth, and there are four options: A. 0.5 percent, B. 5.0 percent, C. 50 percent, D. 3.3 percent.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what economic growth means in this context. Economic growth is typically measured by the percentage increase in real GDP over a certain period. Since it's per capita, I don't have to worry about population growth; I can focus just on the GDP per person.\n\nSo, real GDP per capita in 1990 was $10,000, and in 2000, it was $15,000. I need to find out how much that is in terms of percentage growth.\n\nLet me think about how to calculate the percentage increase. The formula for percentage increase is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{new amount} - \\text{original amount}}{\\text{original amount}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage increase} = \\left( \\frac{15000 - 10000}{10000} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{5000}{10000} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 0.5 \\times 100\\% = 50\\%\n\\]\n\nOkay, so that gives me 50 percent. Looking back at the options, C. 50 percent seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check if there's another way to look at this. Maybe considering the time period between 1990 and 2000. Is there any compounding or annual growth rate that I should consider?\n\nWell, the question is asking for the total amount of economic growth over the period from 1990 to 2000, not the annual growth rate. So, I think the straightforward percentage increase calculation is appropriate here.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the growth rate per year, but again, the question is about the total growth over the period, not the annual rate.\n\nLet me see if there's another approach. Perhaps using the formula for compound annual growth rate (CAGR):\n\n\\[\n\\text{CAGR} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{final value}}{\\text{initial value}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}} - 1\n\\]\n\nWhere n is the number of years.\n\nFrom 1990 to 2000, that's 10 years.\n\n\\[\n\\text{CAGR} = \\left( \\frac{15000}{10000} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{10}} - 1 = (1.5)^{0.1} - 1\n\\]\n\nHmm, calculating that:\n\nFirst, 1.5 raised to the power of 0.1.\n\nWell, 1.5^(1/10) is approximately 1.0442.\n\nSo, CAGR \u2248 1.0442 - 1 = 0.0442, or about 4.42% per year.\n\nBut again, the question isn't asking for the annual growth rate; it's asking for the total growth over the period.\n\nSo, the total growth would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{total growth} = (1 + \\text{CAGR})^n - 1 = (1.0442)^{10} - 1\n\\]\n\nCalculating (1.0442)^10:\n\nLet's see, 1.0442^10 \u2248 1.500, which is exactly 1.500, meaning 50% total growth.\n\nSo, this confirms the earlier calculation of 50%.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question seems to be testing the basic understanding of percentage increase, not necessarily involving compound growth rates.\n\nPerhaps the simplest way is to calculate the difference and then find out what percentage that difference is of the original amount.\n\nSo, difference is $15,000 - $10,000 = $5,000.\n\nPercentage increase is ($5,000 / $10,000) * 100% = 50%.\n\nYes, that matches the first calculation.\n\nI think the answer is C. 50 percent.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider why the other options might be wrong.\n\nOption A. 0.5 percent: That would be a minimal growth, which doesn't align with the $5,000 increase in GDP per capita.\n\nOption B. 5.0 percent: This could be a mistake, perhaps thinking of the annual growth rate, but it's not what the question is asking for.\n\nOption D. 3.3 percent: Not sure where this comes from. Maybe a miscalculation of the growth rate.\n\nBut since my calculations consistently point to 50%, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
