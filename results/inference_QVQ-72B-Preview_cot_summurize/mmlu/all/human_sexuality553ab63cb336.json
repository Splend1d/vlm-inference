                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about Joe and Helen, and it's supposed to be about attachment theory. I'm not super familiar with all the terms, but I remember learning a bit about attachment styles in psychology class. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, there's Joe who really wants to get close to Helen. He's desperate for her attention, but she seems put off by his advances. And it's mentioned that this is typical of Joe's relationships with women. So, it's not just a one-time thing; it's a pattern in his relationships.\n\nNow, according to attachment theory, there are different ways people approach relationships based on their early experiences, right? I think there are secure attachments and insecure attachments. The insecure ones can be avoidant or anxious-ambivalent. There might be more to it, but that's what I recall off the top of my head.\n\nLet me think about secure attachments first. Securely attached people are supposed to be comfortable with intimacy and independence. They don't worry too much about their relationships; they trust their partners. Does Joe sound like that? Not really. He's desperate to get close to Helen, which suggests he might be anxious about their connection. So, maybe he's not securely attached.\n\nNext, there's the avoidant type. I think avoidant lovers are uncomfortable with closeness and prefer to keep some distance in relationships. They might seem distant or not very interested in committing. Does Joe sound like that? No, he's trying really hard to get close to Helen. So, probably not avoidant.\n\nThen there's the anxious-ambivalent type. This sounds more like Joe. Anxious-ambivalent lovers are often worried about their relationships. They crave closeness and approval from their partners but may not feel confident in getting it. They might come on strong and be needy, which can push the other person away. That seems to fit Joe's behavior pretty well. He's desperate to get close to Helen, which might be making her feel uncomfortable or put off.\n\nThere's also an option D: a passionate lover. But that seems a bit vague. Passionate can mean intense love and attraction, but it doesn't necessarily fit the description of Joe's behavior as desperate and putting off to Helen.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like C: an anxious-ambivalent lover is the best description of Joe according to attachment theory.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the dynamics between Joe and Helen more deeply. Joe is desperate to get close to Helen, and she's put off by his advances. This could indicate that Joe is anxious about the relationship, which aligns with the anxious-ambivalent attachment style. These individuals often have a strong desire for closeness but also fear rejection, which can lead to needy or smothering behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, if Helen were also avoidant, she might be resistant to Joe's advances, which could explain why she's put off by them. But the question is about Joe's attachment style, not Helen's.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about both partners' attachment styles to fully understand the interaction. But the question is specifically about Joe, so I should focus on his behavior and tendencies.\n\nAnother thing I recall is that anxious-ambivalent individuals may have difficulty trusting their partners and may need constant reassurance. In Joe's case, his desperation to get close could be a manifestation of his need for reassurance and fear of rejection.\n\nSecure lovers, on the other hand, would be more balanced in their approach to relationships. They would be comfortable with both intimacy and independence and wouldn't exhibit the kind of desperate behavior that Joe is showing.\n\nAvoidant lovers, as I mentioned earlier, would be more distant and less inclined to seek closeness, which is the opposite of Joe's behavior.\n\nPassionate lovers could be intense in their affections, but passion isn't necessarily tied to a specific attachment style. Passion can exist in secure relationships as well.\n\nTherefore, based on the description, C: an anxious-ambivalent lover seems to be the most appropriate choice.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other attachment style that might fit Joe's behavior. For example, there's the disorganized attachment style, which is characterized by confusion and inconsistency in relationships. But the description of Joe's behavior seems pretty consistent\u2014he's consistently desperate in his advances, which doesn't sound disorganized.\n\nAlso, the dismissive-avoidant attachment style involves downplaying the importance of relationships and avoiding emotional closeness, which again doesn't match Joe's behavior.\n\nSo, after considering these possibilities, I still believe that C: an anxious-ambivalent lover is the correct answer.\n\nTo sum it up, attachment theory suggests that people have different patterns of forming and maintaining relationships, and based on Joe's behavior in trying desperately to get close to Helen and appearing put off by his advances, it's likely that Joe exhibits characteristics of an anxious-ambivalent lover.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
