The department is testing soil samples to see if the lead level exceeds the allowed limit, and based on that, they decide whether to close the park or keep it open. The question is asking which decision would result from a type I error.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a type I error is. From my statistics class, I remember that a type I error occurs when you reject a null hypothesis that is actually true. So, in this context, the null hypothesis is probably that the lead levels are within the allowed limit, and the alternative hypothesis is that the lead levels exceed the allowed limit.\n\nSo, if I set up the hypotheses:\n\nNull hypothesis (H0): Lead levels are within the allowed limit.\n\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): Lead levels exceed the allowed limit.\n\nA type I error would be rejecting H0 when it is actually true. That means, based on the sample data, they decide that the lead levels are above the limit when in reality, they are within the limit.\n\nNow, let's see what each option says:\n\nA. Closing the park when the lead levels are within the allowed limit.\n\nThis seems to align with a type I error because you're deciding to close the park (rejecting H0) when in fact the lead levels are within the limit (H0 is true).\n\nB. Keeping the park open when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit.\n\nThis would be failing to reject H0 when H0 is false, which is a type II error, not a type I error.\n\nC. Closing the park when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit.\n\nThis would be correctly rejecting H0 when H1 is true, which is a correct decision, not an error.\n\nD. Keeping the park open when the lead levels are within the allowed limit.\n\nThis would be failing to reject H0 when H0 is true, which is also a correct decision.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems to be the one that corresponds to a type I error.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In hypothesis testing, a type I error is indeed rejecting a true null hypothesis. Here, H0 is that lead levels are within the limit. If we close the park based on sample data showing high lead levels, but in reality, the lead levels are within the limit, that's exactly a type I error.\n\nOption B is about keeping the park open when lead levels are above the limit, which would be a failure to reject H0 when H0 is false, that's a type II error.\n\nOption C is closing the park when lead levels are above the limit, which is the correct action because H0 is false.\n\nOption D is keeping the park open when lead levels are within the limit, which is also the correct action because H0 is true.\n\nTherefore, the only option that represents a type I error is A.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
