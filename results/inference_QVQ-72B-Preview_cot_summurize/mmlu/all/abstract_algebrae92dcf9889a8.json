                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one at a time. So, we're dealing with subgroups of finitely generated free abelian groups, and we need to figure out if these subgroups are free abelian themselves, and also what happens when we take the quotient group.\n\nFirst off, let's make sure we understand the terms. A finitely generated free abelian group is a group that's abelian (meaning commutative), free (meaning it has a basis like vector spaces do), and it's generated by a finite number of elements. So, it's isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}^n \\) for some positive integer \\( n \\).\n\nStatement 1 says: If K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then K is free abelian.\n\nHmm, that sounds plausible. I recall that subgroups of free abelian groups are themselves free abelian. Let me think about why that is.\n\nSuppose G is a finitely generated free abelian group, so \\( G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^n \\) for some n. Now, if K is a subgroup of G, then K is also an abelian group since subgroups inherit the group operation's properties.\n\nMoreover, because G is free abelian, any subgroup K should also be free abelian. I think there's a theorem that states that subgroups of free abelian groups are free abelian. Let me try to recall the proof sketch.\n\nIn the case where \\( G = \\mathbb{Z}^n \\), any subgroup K of G can be generated by a set of vectors in \\( \\mathbb{Z}^n \\). We can think of these generators as the columns of a matrix with integer entries. By performing elementary row operations (which correspond to changing the generators of G), we can transform this matrix into a diagonal matrix, where the diagonal entries are positive integers \\( d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_k \\), with \\( d_i \\) dividing \\( d_{i+1} \\).\n\nThis process is similar to finding the Smith normal form of a matrix. The subgroup K is then isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}^k \\), where k is the number of nonzero diagonal entries. So, K is indeed a free abelian group.\n\nWait, but the statement says \"nonzero subgroup.\" The zero subgroup is trivially free abelian, but since it's specified as nonzero, I guess we're excluding the trivial subgroup.\n\nTherefore, statement 1 seems to be true.\n\nNow, statement 2: If K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then G / K is free abelian.\n\nHmm, this is about the quotient group. I know that G is finitely generated and free abelian, and K is a subgroup. Is the quotient group G / K necessarily free abelian?\n\nLet me recall some properties of quotient groups of abelian groups. If G is abelian and K is a subgroup, then G / K is also an abelian group. However, for G / K to be free abelian, it needs to be isomorphic to some \\( \\mathbb{Z}^m \\).\n\nI think there's a theorem that says if G is a finitely generated abelian group and K is a subgroup, then G / K is also a finitely generated abelian group. But is it necessarily free abelian?\n\nWait a minute, there might be a catch here. Let's consider an example.\n\nSuppose G = \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), which is a finitely generated free abelian group. Let K be the subgroup generated by 2, so K = 2\\( \\mathbb{Z} \\). Then, G / K is \\( \\mathbb{Z} / 2\\mathbb{Z} \\), which is a cyclic group of order 2. Is this group free abelian?\n\nWell, \\( \\mathbb{Z} / 2\\mathbb{Z} \\) is not free abelian because it's finite and free abelian groups are infinite unless they're trivial. So, in this case, G / K is not free abelian.\n\nAnother example: Let G = \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\), and let K be the subgroup generated by (2,0). Then G / K is \\( \\mathbb{Z} / 2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\), which is not free abelian because it contains a finite cyclic group.\n\nWait, but \\( \\mathbb{Z} / 2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\) is not free abelian because it has torsion elements, whereas free abelian groups are torsion-free.\n\nSo, in general, even if G is a finitely generated free abelian group and K is a subgroup, G / K is not necessarily free abelian. It might have torsion elements.\n\nI think the correct statement is that if G is a finitely generated abelian group and K is a subgroup, then G / K is a finitely generated abelian group, but it's not necessarily free abelian unless K is a direct summand of G.\n\nTherefore, statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Statement 1: True\n\n- Statement 2: False\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
