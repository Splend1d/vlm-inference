                    "text": "So I have this question about natural selection. It says that natural selection changes allele frequencies in populations because some blank survive and reproduce more successfully than others. And the options are A. alleles, B. loci, C. gene pools, D. individuals. Hmm, I need to figure out which one fits best here.\n\nFirst, I should recall what natural selection is. Natural selection is a mechanism of evolution where certain traits become more or less common in a population over time because of differences in survival and reproduction. So, it's about which individuals in a population are more likely to pass on their genes to the next generation.\n\nThe question mentions that natural selection changes allele frequencies. Alleles are different forms of a gene that can be present at a specific locus on a chromosome. So, if certain alleles make an individual more fit, meaning they're better adapted to their environment, those individuals might survive longer and have more offspring.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nOption A is \"alleles.\" But that doesn't seem right because alleles are the variants of genes, not the entities that survive and reproduce. It's the organisms that carry those alleles that survive and reproduce.\n\nOption B is \"loci.\" Loci are positions on chromosomes where specific genes are located. Again, these are not the ones surviving and reproducing; they're just locations of genes. So, probably not the correct choice.\n\nOption C is \"gene pools.\" A gene pool refers to all the alleles in all the individuals of a population. But again, it's not the gene pool itself that's surviving and reproducing; it's the individual organisms that carry specific alleles.\n\nOption D is \"individuals.\" This seems the most plausible. Natural selection acts on individuals based on their traits, which are determined by their genes. If certain traits make an individual better adapted to its environment, that individual is more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on those advantageous alleles to the next generation.\n\nLet me consider an example to clarify this. Suppose there's a population of beetles with different colors: some are green and some are brown. If the environment is mostly green, predators might have a harder time spotting the green beetles, so more green beetles survive and reproduce compared to the brown ones. Over time, the frequency of the green allele increases in the population because the individuals with that allele were more successful in surviving and reproducing.\n\nSo, in this scenario, it's the individual beetles that are surviving and reproducing differentially based on their genotype and phenotype.\n\nWait a minute, but I've heard of group selection and other concepts where maybe the gene pool or something else could be considered as units of selection. But from what I remember, the primary unit of selection in natural selection is the individual organism.\n\nMoreover, in population genetics, the idea of fitness is often tied to individual reproductive success. So, individuals with higher fitness contribute more offspring to the next generation, thereby increasing the frequency of their advantageous alleles.\n\nLet me also think about the role of alleles here. Alleles don't survive or reproduce on their own; they need to be carried by individuals. So, saying that alleles survive and reproduce more successfully doesn't make much sense because alleles don't have agency or the capacity to reproduce independently.\n\nSimilarly, loci are just positions on chromosomes, and gene pools are collective sets of alleles in a population. Neither of these can survive or reproduce in the same way that individuals can.\n\nTherefore, the most logical answer is option D: individuals. Natural selection changes allele frequencies because some individuals survive and reproduce more successfully than others, depending on their genetic makeup and how well it suits them to their environment.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the definition of natural selection again. Natural selection is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype. So, it's indeed about individuals differing in their ability to survive and reproduce based on their traits.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. individuals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
