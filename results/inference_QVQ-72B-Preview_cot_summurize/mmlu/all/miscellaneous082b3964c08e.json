                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"A _ is a plant cell that helps control the passage of materials into and out of the stomates.\" And the options are A. Cell membrane, B. Cytoplasm, C. Guard cell, D. Cellulose. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what stomates are. I remember that stomates, or stomata, are small openings on the leaves of plants. They're like pores that let in carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and release oxygen during that process. They also help in transpiration, which is when water evaporates from the plant. So, these stomates are pretty important for a plant's health.\n\nNow, the question is asking about what helps control the passage of materials into and out of these stomates. That sounds like some mechanism that opens and closes these pores to regulate the flow of gases and water vapor.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Cell membrane: I know that the cell membrane is part of the cell that regulates what comes in and out, but in the context of stomates, which are on the leaf surface, I'm not sure if that's the direct controller of the stomates.\n\nB. Cytoplasm: This is the gel-like substance inside the cell where all the organelles are suspended. It doesn't sound like it directly controls the stomates.\n\nC. Guard cell: This sounds promising. I think guard cells are associated with stomates. Maybe they open and close the stomates based on certain conditions, like light or water availability.\n\nD. Cellulose: This is a component of plant cell walls. It provides structure and support but doesn't seem to be involved in controlling stomates.\n\nSo, between these options, C. Guard cell seems the most likely answer. But I should double-check.\n\nI recall that stomates are flanked by two guard cells, which are kidney-shaped. When these guard cells fill with water, they swell and the stomate opens. When they lose water, they deflate and the stomate closes. This opening and closing regulate the exchange of gases and water vapor.\n\nSo, yes, guard cells are directly responsible for controlling the stomates. Therefore, option C. Guard cell is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let's quickly consider if any of the other options could possibly be related.\n\nA. Cell membrane: While cell membranes in general regulate traffic into and out of cells, the specific control of stomates is more directly attributed to the guard cells.\n\nB. Cytoplasm: This is inside the cell and doesn't directly control external openings like stomates.\n\nD. Cellulose: This is part of the cell wall and doesn't have a role in opening or closing stomates.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Guard cell.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Guard cell}} \\]"
