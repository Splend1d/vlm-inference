                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question about Sikhism. It's asking for the term that describes the \"pure\" as an order of loyal Sikhs bound together. The options are A. Khalsa, B. Rahit, C. Panj Kakke, and D. Shabad. Hmm, I need to recall what each of these terms means in the context of Sikhism.\n\nFirst off, I know that Sikhism is a religion that originated in the 15th century in the Punjab region, which is now divided between India and Pakistan. The founder of Sikhism is Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Sikhs believe in one God and emphasize the importance of living a moral life and helping others.\n\nNow, focusing on the question, it mentions the \"pure\" as an order of loyal Sikhs bound together. That sounds familiar. Let me think about each option:\n\nA. Khalsa: I remember that the Khalsa is a group within Sikhism that was founded by the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh Ji, in 1699. He initiated the first members, known as the Panj Pyare, and they took vows to live according to strict codes of conduct. They also adopted the Five Ks, which are symbols of their faith. So, the Khalsa is indeed an order of Sikhs who are committed to living a disciplined life according to Sikh principles. That seems to fit the description of being \"pure\" and loyal.\n\nB. Rahit: Rahit refers to the code of conduct or moral guidelines that Sikhs are expected to follow. It outlines how Sikhs should live their lives, including practices like not consuming intoxicants, maintaining honesty, and upholding moral values. However, Rahit is more of a set of guidelines rather than an order or group within Sikhism. So, it might not be the correct choice here.\n\nC. Panj Kakke: This term refers to the Five Ks, which are the five items that Khalsa Sikhs are expected to carry with them at all times as symbols of their faith. The Five Ks are Kesh (uncut hair), Kangha (a wooden comb), Kara (a steel bracelet), Kachera (cotton undergarments), and Kirpan (a ceremonial sword). So, Panj Kakke are the symbols of the Khalsa, but they aren't the order itself.\n\nD. Shabad: Shabad refers to the divine word or the teachings of the Gurus as found in the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of Sikhism. It's about living according to the wisdom contained in these teachings. While it's an important concept in Sikhism, it doesn't specifically refer to an order of loyal Sikhs.\n\nGiven these explanations, it seems that option A. Khalsa is the most appropriate answer. The Khalsa is indeed an order of Sikhs who are bound together by their commitment to live a pure and disciplined life according to Sikh principles.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. Is there any other term that could possibly fit the description better? For instance, could Rahit also be considered an order? No, Rahit is more about the code of conduct rather than a group of people. Similarly, Panj Kakke are the symbols carried by Khalsa Sikhs, not the group itself. And Shabad is about the divine teachings, not an order of loyal Sikhs.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is A. Khalsa.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Khalsa}} \\]"
