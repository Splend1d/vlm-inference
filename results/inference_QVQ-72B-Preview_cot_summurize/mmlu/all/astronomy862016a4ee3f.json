                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about the rotation of a solid disk. There are four options, and I need to figure out which one is true. Let me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that the velocity is the same on every point on the disk. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. I remember from physics class that in rotational motion, different points on an object can have different velocities depending on their distance from the axis of rotation. So, if the disk is rotating around its axis, points farther out should have higher velocities because they have to travel a longer distance in the same time compared to points closer to the axis. Therefore, the velocity isn't the same everywhere. Maybe A is not correct.\n\nOption B says that the part closer to the axis has a longer period. Period in rotation is the time it takes for one complete rotation. So, if I consider different points on the disk, do they all have the same period? I think in a solid disk rotating at a constant angular speed, every point has the same period because they all complete one full rotation in the same amount of time. So, the period shouldn't be longer for points closer to the axis; in fact, it should be the same for all points. So, maybe B is incorrect too.\n\nOption C says that the period of rotation is the same on every point on the disk. This seems to align with what I just thought. In a solid disk rotating uniformly, every point has the same period because they're all rotating at the same angular speed. So, this seems like a possible answer.\n\nOption D says that the part closer to the axis has a shorter period. This contradicts what I just thought. If all points have the same period in a solid disk rotating uniformly, then this option can't be correct.\n\nLet me double-check. I recall that in rotational motion, the angular velocity (omega) is the same for all points on a rigid body like a solid disk, assuming it's rotating about a fixed axis. The linear velocity (v) of a point on the disk is given by v = r * omega, where r is the distance from the axis. So, as I thought earlier, points farther out have higher linear velocities because they have larger radii.\n\nNow, the period (T) is the time for one complete rotation, and it's related to angular velocity by T = 2\u03c0 / omega. Since omega is constant for all points in a rigid body rotating uniformly, T should also be the same for all points. So, options B and D, which suggest that the period varies with distance from the axis, are incorrect.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the correct answer: the period of rotation is the same on every point on the disk.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if the disk is rotating with variable angular velocity or if there's any slipping or other factors, but the question specifies a solid disk, which implies it's rigid and rotates as a single unit.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the formula for period again. Period T is indeed 2\u03c0 divided by the angular velocity omega. Since omega is constant for all points in a solid disk rotating uniformly, T should be the same for all points. So, option C holds true.\n\nI think I've got it right. Option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
