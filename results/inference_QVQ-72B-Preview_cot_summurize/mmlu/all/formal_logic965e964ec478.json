                    "text": "Let's tackle this logic problem step by step. So, we have two propositions: I and H. The given expression is:\n\nI \u2261 ~H and ~(~I \u2261 H)\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. There are two parts connected by \"and\": I \u2261 ~H and ~(~I \u2261 H). So, I need to construct a truth table for both parts and see how they relate.\n\nLet's recall that \"\u2261\" stands for logical equivalence, which means that two propositions are true under the same conditions. Also, \"~\" is the negation operator.\n\nSo, I \u2261 ~H means that I and ~H are logically equivalent. Similarly, ~I \u2261 H means that ~I and H are logically equivalent.\n\nBut wait, there's a negation outside the second equivalence: ~(~I \u2261 H). This means it's the negation of the equivalence of ~I and H.\n\nAlright, let's make a truth table for I and H, and then calculate each part.\n\nFirst, list all possible truth values for I and H:\n\nI | H\n\nT | T\n\nT | F\n\nF | T\n\nF | F\n\nNow, calculate ~H and ~I for each case:\n\n~H is the negation of H, and ~I is the negation of I.\n\nI | H | ~H | ~I\n\nT | T | F | F\n\nT | F | T | F\n\nF | T | F | T\n\nF | F | T | T\n\nNext, calculate I \u2261 ~H. Remember that \u2261 is true when both propositions have the same truth value.\n\nI | ~H | I \u2261 ~H\n\nT | F | F\n\nT | T | T\n\nF | F | T\n\nF | T | F\n\nSimilarly, calculate ~I \u2261 H:\n\n~I | H | ~I \u2261 H\n\nF | T | T\n\nF | F | T\n\nT | T | T\n\nT | F | F\n\nNow, ~(~I \u2261 H) is the negation of the above equivalence:\n\n~I | H | ~I \u2261 H | ~(~I \u2261 H)\n\nF | T | T | F\n\nF | F | T | F\n\nT | T | T | F\n\nT | F | F | T\n\nSo, the expression I \u2261 ~H and ~(~I \u2261 H) means we need to take the conjunction (and) of the two results:\n\n(I \u2261 ~H) and (~(~I \u2261 H))\n\nLet's combine the results:\n\nI | H | I \u2261 ~H | ~(~I \u2261 H) | (I \u2261 ~H) and (~(~I \u2261 H))\n\nT | T | F | F | F\n\nT | F | T | F | F\n\nF | T | T | F | F\n\nF | F | F | T | F\n\nSo, in all cases, the conjunction is false. That means the entire expression is always false, regardless of the truth values of I and H.\n\nNow, the question is to determine whether these statements are logically equivalent, contradictory, consistent, or inconsistent.\n\nFirst, logically equivalent means that two statements have the same truth table. But here, we have a single complex statement, not two separate statements to compare.\n\nContradictory would mean that the statement is always false, which seems to be the case here, since the truth table shows it's always false.\n\nInconsistent usually refers to a set of statements that cannot all be true at the same time. But again, here we have a single statement.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to interpret the question differently. Maybe \"the following pairs of propositions\" refers to I and H, or perhaps I and the entire expression.\n\nLet me read the question again:\n\n\"Construct a complete truth table for the following pairs of propositions. Then, using the truth tables, determine whether the statements are logically equivalent or contradictory. If neither, determine whether they are consistent or inconsistent. Justify your answers.\n\nI \u2261 ~H and ~(~I \u2261 H)\n\nA. Logically equivalent\n\nB. Contradictory\n\nC. Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent\n\nD. Inconsistent\"\n\nHmm, it seems a bit ambiguous. It says \"the following pairs of propositions,\" but only one expression is given. Maybe it's referring to the pair consisting of I and H, or perhaps I and the expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pair is \"I \u2261 ~H\" and \"~( ~I \u2261 H ).\"\n\nLet's assume that the pair is \"I \u2261 ~H\" and \"~( ~I \u2261 H ).\" So, we need to construct truth tables for both and compare them.\n\nFirst, construct the truth table for I \u2261 ~H, which we already have:\n\nI | H | I \u2261 ~H\n\nT | T | F\n\nT | F | T\n\nF | T | T\n\nF | F | F\n\nNow, construct the truth table for ~( ~I \u2261 H ), which we also have:\n\nI | H | ~( ~I \u2261 H )\n\nT | T | F\n\nT | F | F\n\nF | T | F\n\nF | F | T\n\nNow, compare these two truth tables:\n\nFor I \u2261 ~H:\n\nT | T | F\n\nT | F | T\n\nF | T | T\n\nF | F | F\n\nFor ~( ~I \u2261 H ):\n\nT | T | F\n\nT | F | F\n\nF | T | F\n\nF | F | T\n\nLooking at the truth values:\n\n- When I=T and H=T: F vs. F\n\n- When I=T and H=F: T vs. F\n\n- When I=F and H=T: T vs. F\n\n- When I=F and H=F: F vs. T\n\nSince the truth values do not match in all rows, these two statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nMoreover, since there are rows where both are true (I=F and H=F for I \u2261 ~H, and I=F and H=F for ~( ~I \u2261 H )), and rows where both are false (I=T and H=T), they are not contradictory either.\n\nWait, but in the first row, both are false; in the second and third rows, I \u2261 ~H is true and ~( ~I \u2261 H ) is false; in the fourth row, I \u2261 ~H is false and ~( ~I \u2261 H ) is true.\n\nSo, they are not always opposites, hence not contradictory.\n\nNow, the options are:\n\nC. Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent\n\nD. Inconsistent\n\nConsistency refers to whether both statements can be true at the same time. Inconsistency means they cannot both be true at the same time.\n\nFrom the truth table, there is at least one row where both statements are true: when I=F and H=F.\n\nTherefore, they are consistent.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nLogically equivalent: No, because their truth tables don't match.\n\nContradictory: No, because their truth values aren't always opposite.\n\nConsistent: Yes, because there is at least one case where both are true.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression I \u2261 ~H and ~( ~I \u2261 H ) as a single statement and compare it to something else, but the question seems to refer to \"the following pairs of propositions,\" which likely means two separate statements.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
