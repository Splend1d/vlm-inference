                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about magnetic force on a moving charged particle. It says the magnetic force can change the particle's:\n\nA. speed\n\nB. direction\n\nC. Both of these\n\nD. Neither of these\n\nHmm, I need to recall what exactly magnetic force does to a moving charged particle. I remember that magnetic force is perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the velocity of the particle. So, if a charged particle is moving in a magnetic field, it experiences a force that's always perpendicular to its direction of motion.\n\nWait, does that mean it's changing the direction of the velocity vector without changing its magnitude? Because if the force is always perpendicular to the velocity, it should only affect the direction, right? Like when you have circular motion, the centripetal force is always perpendicular to the velocity and it keeps the speed constant while changing the direction.\n\nSo, in that case, the magnetic force would be changing the direction of the particle but not its speed. That would make sense because work done is force times displacement in the direction of the force, and since the force is perpendicular to the velocity, no work is being done, so kinetic energy should remain constant. Kinetic energy depends on speed, so speed should stay the same.\n\nBut let me think about this more carefully. The magnetic force formula is F = qvB sin(theta), where q is charge, v is velocity, B is magnetic field strength, and theta is the angle between v and B. If v and B are perpendicular, then sin(theta) is 1, so F = qvB. And since F is perpendicular to v, as I said, it should only change the direction of v, not its magnitude.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose I have a positive charge moving north and there's a magnetic field pointing east. The force would be upwards, according to the right-hand rule. So, the particle would start moving north and be deflected upwards. Its speed should remain constant unless there's some other force acting on it to change the speed.\n\nWait, but what if the particle is moving parallel to the magnetic field? Then theta is 0 degrees, and sin(theta) is 0, so F is 0. In that case, the particle keeps moving in a straight line at constant speed since there's no force acting on it.\n\nAnother scenario: if the particle is moving at an angle that's not 90 degrees to the field, then the force would still be perpendicular to both v and B, and it would cause the particle to move in a helical path, where the component of velocity parallel to the field remains constant, and the perpendicular component causes circular motion.\n\nSo, in all these cases, the magnetic force seems to be only changing the direction of the particle's velocity without changing its speed. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. direction.\n\nBut let's double-check. Is there any situation where magnetic force can change the speed of the particle? From what I recall, as long as the magnetic field is constant, the magnetic force only changes the direction of the particle's velocity, not its magnitude. So, speed remains constant.\n\nI think the answer is B. direction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
