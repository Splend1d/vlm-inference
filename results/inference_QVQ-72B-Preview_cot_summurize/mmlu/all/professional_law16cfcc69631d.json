The doctor re-domiciled in the state, where he opened a new office for the practice of optometry. When he initially opened his office, the doctor was unaware of the state's licensing provision for optometrists. Since the doctor was a licensed optometrist for 10 years, he assumed that he could practice optometry in the state by reciprocity. The doctor received notification from the state's board of optometrists that he was illegally practicing optometry and that he must immediately cease and desist from such practice.

                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about the constitutionality of a state's medical licensing statute under the Commerce Clause. The scenario is that there's a doctor who graduated from an optometry school in a neighboring state, got licensed there, practiced for about a year, then moved to another state and started practicing optometry without realizing there was a specific licensing requirement. This new state has a law, Section 2022(a), which says that only those who graduated from an optometry school located in the state and accredited by the state's board of optometrists can be licensed to practice optometry there.\n\nNow, the doctor is challenging this statute as violating the Commerce Clause. The Commerce Clause is part of the U.S. Constitution that gives Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states. Over time, the Supreme Court has interpreted the Commerce Clause to also impose limits on state regulations that unduly burden interstate commerce.\n\nIn this case, the doctor is arguing that this licensing statute is unconstitutional because it favors in-state optometry schools and possibly discriminates against out-of-state optometrists, which would be a burden on interstate commerce.\n\nThe question is asking which of the provided options is the weakest defense the state could offer against this challenge. So, I need to evaluate each option and see which one is the least persuasive or defensible under the Commerce Clause.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. The statute will help to ensure that only the most qualified optometrists practice in the state.\n\nThis seems like a pretty standard justification for licensing requirements. States often require specific educational credentials to ensure public safety and quality of care. However, the issue here is that the statute requires graduation from an in-state school, which might not be the best way to ensure quality if there are equally qualified out-of-state schools. But, on its face, this defense is about ensuring quality, which is a legitimate state interest.\n\nB. The statute will help protect the optometrists in the state from competition outside the state.\n\nThis sounds like it's about protecting in-state optometrists from out-of-state competition. While protecting domestic interests can be a motivation for some state regulations, it's not typically a strong defense under the Commerce Clause. In fact, if the primary purpose is to shield in-state economic interests from out-of-state competition, that could be seen as a violation of the Commerce Clause.\n\nC. The statute will help to ensure a continuously available number of practicing optometrists within the state.\n\nThis seems to be about ensuring a steady supply of optometrists in the state. Maybe by requiring optometrists to graduate from in-state schools, the state is encouraging more people to study and practice optometry within the state, ensuring that there are enough professionals to serve the population. This could be seen as a legitimate state interest in public health and welfare.\n\nD. The statute will help to ensure that the practicing optometrists in the state are subject to standards of a regulatory body.\n\nThis is similar to option A, focusing on ensuring that optometrists meet certain standards. By requiring accreditation by the state's board of optometrists, the state is ensuring that practitioners adhere to specific professional standards, which is another legitimate state interest in protecting public health.\n\nNow, considering these options, I need to determine which one is the weakest defense against the doctor's challenge.\n\nFirst, option B seems problematic because it directly suggests that the purpose of the statute is to protect in-state optometrists from out-of-state competition. The Commerce Clause generally prohibits states from enacting regulations that favor in-state economic interests over out-of-state interests without a compelling justification.\n\nIn contrast, options A, C, and D all relate to ensuring the quality and availability of optometric services, which are legitimate state interests. While option B focuses on protecting domestic economic interests, which is less defensible under the Commerce Clause, the other options are more aligned with general police powers of the state to regulate professions for the public's health and safety.\n\nTherefore, option B appears to be the weakest defense because it most clearly reflects a protectionist motive, which is disfavored under the Commerce Clause.\n\nBut wait, let's think deeper. Maybe there's another way to interpret this.\n\nOption A says the statute ensures only the most qualified optometrists practice in the state. However, by requiring graduation from an in-state school, it might exclude equally qualified optometrists from other accredited schools outside the state. This could be seen as unnecessarily burdensome and potentially discriminatory.\n\nOption C mentions ensuring a continuously available number of practicing optometrists. Perhaps the state is concerned about a shortage of optometrists and wants to encourage more students to attend in-state schools and stay to practice. This could be a valid concern, but it still might not justify discriminating against out-of-state optometrists if there are less restrictive means to achieve the same goal.\n\nOption D focuses on regulatory standards, which is a core function of professional licensing. Ensuring that optometrists are subject to the state's regulatory body could be important for maintaining consistent standards and enforcing disciplinary actions.\n\nComparing all these, option B still seems the weakest because it directly admits to the protectionist intent, which is a classic example of what the Commerce Clause is designed to prevent.\n\nLet me consider some case law. In Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc. (1970), the Supreme Court established a test where the burden imposed on interstate commerce by a state regulation must be clearly outweighed by the local benefits. If the state's defense is that the regulation protects domestic economic interests from out-of-state competition, that's likely to fail the Pike balancing test.\n\nOn the other hand, if the state's defense is about ensuring quality and public safety, as in options A and D, that might be more defensible, provided that there are no alternative means to achieve those objectives that are less burdensome to interstate commerce.\n\nOption C, ensuring a continuous supply of optometrists, could also be a legitimate state interest, but it might still face challenges if the means chosen to achieve it\u2014requiring graduation from an in-state school\u2014is overly burdensome to out-of-state optometrists.\n\nHowever, among all the options, option B is the most straightforward admission of a protectionist motive, which is the least defensible under the Commerce Clause.\n\nTherefore, the weakest defense that the state could offer is option B: The statute will help protect the optometrists in the state from competition outside the state.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
