Thomas Jefferson, C. Benjamin Franklin, D. Franklin Roosevelt. Hmm, I need to figure this out.\n\nFirst off, I know that a dime is a type of American coin. It's a ten-cent coin, right? So, it's smaller than a quarter and bigger than a penny. But what's on it?\n\nI remember that different presidents are on different coins. For example, Abraham Lincoln is on the penny, and Thomas Jefferson is on the nickel. Wait, is that right? Let me think. Actually, I think Jefferson is on the nickel. So, option B is Thomas Jefferson, and he's on the nickel, not the dime.\n\nOption A is George Washington. I know Washington is on the one-dollar bill, and also on the quarter, I think. Wait, no, the quarter is 25 cents. So, is Washington on the quarter? I think so. But maybe he's also on the dime? I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nOption C is Benjamin Franklin. I know Franklin is on the hundred-dollar bill. So, he's not on the dime.\n\nOption D is Franklin Roosevelt. I don't recall Roosevelt being on any coins, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me think about it.\n\nWait a minute, I think Roosevelt is on the dime. Yeah, I think that's right. The dime has Roosevelt's profile on it. But let me make sure.\n\nI can picture the dime in my mind. It's a small, silver-colored coin. The front has a portrait of a man, and I think it's Franklin Roosevelt. Yeah, that sounds familiar.\n\nJust to be sure, I'll try to recall if there's any other president on the dime. No, I don't think so. Washington is on the quarter, Jefferson on the nickel, Lincoln on the penny, and Roosevelt on the dime.\n\nSo, based on that, the correct answer should be D. Franklin Roosevelt.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, maybe I should consider if there have been any recent changes or special editions of dimes that might feature someone else. But no, I don't think that's the case. The standard circulating dime still has Roosevelt on it.\n\nAlright, I'm pretty confident now. The answer is D. Franklin Roosevelt.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
