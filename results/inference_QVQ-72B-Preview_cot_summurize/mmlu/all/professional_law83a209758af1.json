                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario about a customer who broke a tooth on a pebble in their clam chowder at a restaurant. The customer wants to sue the restaurant under strict liability, and I need to determine which option is most likely correct. Let me start by understanding what strict liability means in this context.\n\nI know that strict liability in product liability cases generally holds manufacturers and sellers responsible for harm caused by defective products, regardless of whether they were negligent or not. So, in this case, the restaurant is being considered as the seller of the product, which is the clam chowder.\n\nNow, the clam chowder was not homemade but was purchased from a wholesale distributor and served to the customer. The customer broke a tooth on a pebble that was in the soup, and this pebble wasn't something that a reasonable inspection by the restaurant would have discovered.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says the customer will recover if a reasonable consumer would not expect the presence of such a pebble in the chowder. Hmm, this seems relevant. In strict liability cases, one of the considerations is whether the product is unreasonably dangerous. If a pebble is something that a reasonable consumer wouldn't expect in the chowder, it might make the product unreasonably dangerous. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption B says the customer will recover but only if the restaurant had received prior notice of the defective condition of the soup. Strict liability doesn't typically require prior notice. It's more about the state of the product at the time of sale or consumption. So, I think this might not be correct.\n\nOption C says the customer will not recover because a reasonable inspection of the soup would not have disclosed the existence of the pebble. This seems contradictory. If the restaurant couldn't have reasonably known about the pebble, does that affect the customer's ability to recover under strict liability? I think strict liability is more about the defect itself causing injury, regardless of the seller's knowledge. So, maybe this isn't the right answer.\n\nOption D says the customer will not recover because the soup would not constitute an unreasonably dangerous product when it was served to the customer. This seems to contradict what I thought about option A. If there's a pebble in the soup that causes injury, that sounds like an unreasonably dangerous product to me.\n\nLet me think more deeply about this. In strict liability cases, the product must be defective and unreasonably dangerous. The defect must also cause the injury. Here, the pebble is the defect, and it caused the tooth to break. So, those elements seem to be met.\n\nBut option C suggests that because the restaurant couldn't have known about the pebble through reasonable inspection, the customer can't recover. However, in strict liability, the focus is on the product's condition, not the seller's knowledge or inspection abilities. So, even if the restaurant couldn't have known, the customer should still be able to recover from the manufacturer or the seller.\n\nOption B mentions prior notice, which isn't typically a requirement for strict liability claims. Strict liability is meant to hold sellers accountable for defective products without the need to prove they knew or should have known about the defect.\n\nOption D claims that the soup isn't unreasonably dangerous. But having a pebble in the soup that breaks a tooth seems like it could be considered unreasonably dangerous. It's not something you'd expect in food, and it caused physical harm.\n\nSo, between options A and D, I think option A is more accurate. If a reasonable consumer wouldn't expect a pebble in the chowder, and it caused harm, then the customer should be able to recover under strict liability.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider whether the restaurant is being sued directly under strict liability for selling the product. In some jurisdictions, restaurants can be held strictly liable for injuries caused by defective food products they serve, even if they didn't know about the defect.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the pebble was not something that a reasonable inspection would have discovered, it's likely that the restaurant is still liable under strict liability principles. Therefore, the customer should be able to recover if it's established that the pebble was not something a reasonable consumer would expect in the chowder, making it unreasonably dangerous.\n\nSo, my final thought is that option A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
