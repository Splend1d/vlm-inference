                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the elastic clause, and I need to figure out which option best illustrates its use. The elastic clause, as I recall, is in the U.S. Constitution, and it allows Congress to pass laws necessary and proper for carrying out its duties. It's like a flexible part that lets Congress handle things that aren't explicitly listed in the Constitution but are needed to make other powers work.\n\nAlright, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: The Supreme Court allows a lower court ruling to stand by refusing to hear an appeal. Hmm, this seems to be about the Supreme Court's role in the judicial system, not directly about Congress passing laws. The elastic clause is about Congress's legislative powers, so this probably isn't the best fit.\n\nOption B: A congressional committee prevents the full chamber from voting on legislation by delaying its report. This sounds like something internal to Congress, maybe about procedure or how bills are handled in committees. It doesn't seem to directly relate to using the elastic clause to pass new legislation.\n\nOption C: Congress passes legislation establishing a national speed limit. Now, this is interesting. The elastic clause is often used to pass laws that are necessary and proper for exercising other enumerated powers. If Congress is passing a law about a national speed limit, is that related to its power to regulate interstate commerce or something else? Maybe, but I'm not entirely sure if this directly ties to the elastic clause.\n\nOption D: A member of the House of Representatives introduces a bill to increase federal income tax rates. This seems straightforward. Congress has the power to levy taxes, which is an enumerated power. But does the elastic clause come into play here? Maybe not directly, because setting tax rates is more of an exercise of the direct taxing power.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps none of these options perfectly illustrate the use of the elastic clause. Or maybe I'm missing something. Let me think differently.\n\nThe elastic clause is formally known as the necessary and proper clause, found in Article I, Section 8, Clause 18 of the Constitution. It gives Congress the power to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying out its enumerated powers. So, it's about enabling Congress to pass laws that are needed to make other powers effective.\n\nIn that context, option C\u2014Congress passing legislation establishing a national speed limit\u2014might be seen as using the elastic clause if the speed limit is considered necessary and proper for regulating interstate commerce or ensuring road safety, which connects to other congressional powers.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely convinced that's the best illustration. Maybe I should consider what the elastic clause has historically been used for.\n\nHistorically, the elastic clause has been interpreted broadly by the Supreme Court, especially in cases like McCulloch v. Maryland, where it was decided that Congress could establish a national bank as part of its power to collect taxes and regulate commerce.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to identify which option involves Congress passing a law that's not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution but is necessary and proper for exercising another enumerated power.\n\nOption A is about the Supreme Court's actions, not Congress's law-making.\n\nOption B is about a committee delaying a report, which seems more about congressional procedure than passing new laws.\n\nOption D is about introducing a bill to increase tax rates, which is a direct exercise of Congress's taxing power, without necessarily invoking the elastic clause.\n\nOption C is about passing a national speed limit. Is this a direct exercise of an enumerated power, or is it an example of using the elastic clause to achieve another goal?\n\nWell, Congress does have the power to regulate interstate commerce, and setting speed limits could be seen as related to that, especially if it affects vehicles crossing state lines or impacts commerce between states.\n\nBut in reality, national speed limits are often set through federal regulations or through funding incentives to states, rather than a direct federal law imposing a speed limit.\n\nStill, if Congress were to pass a law setting a national speed limit, it might be justified under the commerce clause, possibly with the elastic clause providing additional authority.\n\nComparing all the options, option C seems to be the one that most closely relates to Congress using the elastic clause to pass legislation that aids in exercising another power.\n\nAlternatively, maybe option D could be seen as using the elastic clause if increasing tax rates is necessary for funding other congressional powers.\n\nBut generally, setting tax rates is a direct exercise of Congress's taxing authority, so it might not necessarily invoke the elastic clause in the same way.\n\nPerhaps the answer is C, but I'm still a bit unsure.\n\nLet me check another angle. Maybe I should consider which option involves Congress passing a law that addresses an issue not explicitly covered by the Constitution but is still related to its powers.\n\nOption C, a national speed limit, could be seen as such a law, especially if it's connected to regulating interstate commerce or ensuring road safety, which affects multiple states.\n\nIn contrast, option D is about introducing a bill to increase tax rates, which is a straightforward fiscal measure within Congress's enumerated powers.\n\nSo, while both could be important, option C seems to involve a more expansive use of congressional power, potentially leveraging the elastic clause to achieve a policy goal.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C: Congress passes legislation establishing a national speed limit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
