                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find the sum of -9 and -8 using a number line. First things first, I should recall what a number line looks like. It's a straight line with zero in the middle, positive numbers to the right, and negative numbers to the left.\n\nSo, the number line extends from negative infinity to positive infinity, but for this problem, I only need the part from, say, -15 to +15. Zero is the starting point, and numbers to the left are negative, getting smaller as I move leftward.\n\nNow, to add two negative numbers like -9 and -8, I should understand what it means to add negative numbers. Adding a negative number is the same as subtracting a positive number. Wait, let me think about that. If I have -9 and I add -8, it's like taking nine steps to the left from zero and then another eight steps to the left. So, starting at -9 and moving another 8 units to the left would land me at -17.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it algebraically. The sum of two negative numbers is a negative number whose absolute value is the sum of their absolute values. So, |-9| is 9 and |-8| is 8. Adding those gives 17. Since both numbers are negative, the result is negative 17.\n\nLet me double-check this with the number line. Starting at zero, I move 9 units to the left to reach -9. Then, from -9, I move another 8 units to the left. So, -9 minus 8 is -17. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait a minute, could there be another way to look at this? Maybe using the concept of opposites or something. Let's see. The opposite of -9 is 9, but I don't think that's relevant here since I'm adding another negative number.\n\nAnother way: maybe thinking about real-world scenarios. Suppose I owe someone $9 and then I owe another $8. In total, I owe $17, which would be represented as -17 in terms of my balance.\n\nAlso, considering the properties of addition. Addition is associative and commutative, but in this case, both numbers are negative, so the order doesn't matter. -9 plus -8 is the same as -8 plus -9, both equal to -17.\n\nLet me consider the options provided:\n\nA. -17\n\nB. 1\n\nC. -1\n\nD. 17\n\nBased on my reasoning, the correct answer should be -17. But just to be thorough, let's eliminate the other options.\n\nOption B is 1. That doesn't make sense because adding two negative numbers shouldn't result in a positive number.\n\nOption C is -1. That would be if I was adding -9 and +8, which would give -1, but in this case, both are negative.\n\nOption D is 17. Again, that's positive, and adding two negatives shouldn't result in a positive.\n\nTherefore, the only correct choice is A. -17.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's use the number line again. Starting at 0, move to -9, then add -8, ending up at -17. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and I'm confident that the answer is -17.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-17} \\]"
