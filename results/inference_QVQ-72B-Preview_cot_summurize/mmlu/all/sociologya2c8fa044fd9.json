                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out why comprehensive schools in the 1960s didn't succeed in eliminating class inequalities in education. There are four options here, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that comprehensive schools tended to recruit pupils from inner cities and traditionally working-class areas. Hmm, that might sound like a good thing because it's targeting areas where there might be more need. But maybe there's a downside to that. Perhaps these areas had fewer resources or faced more challenges, which could affect educational outcomes. But I'm not sure if that directly explains why class inequalities persisted.\n\nOption B suggests that selective schools could still 'cream off' the most able pupils, while comprehensive schools put children into ability streams. This seems interesting. If selective schools are taking the top students, then the comprehensive schools would be left with a mix of students, some of whom are higher ability but many who are not. Additionally, if comprehensives use ability streaming, that might create inequalities within the school itself. Maybe the higher-ability streams get better resources or more attention, leaving the lower streams at a disadvantage. This could reinforce class inequalities, especially if the selective schools are more accessible to students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\nOption C mentions something about teachers using the restricted code in the classroom, while working-class pupils use elaborated codes of speech. I'm a bit confused here. I think this is referring to different styles of communication. Maybe working-class students use a different way of speaking compared to the teaching style, which could lead to communication barriers in the classroom. If teachers are using a style that's unfamiliar to some students, it might put those students at a disadvantage. But I'm not entirely sure how this directly relates to class inequalities in education overall.\n\nOption D talks about national testing and league tables making the new schools highly competitive and selective. League tables rank schools based on their performance, often using test scores. If schools are being ranked this way, there might be pressure on them to perform well, which could lead to them focusing more on higher-achieving students or finding ways to improve their scores, possibly at the expense of lower-achieving students. This could exacerbate inequalities, as schools might not focus enough on supporting students from disadvantaged backgrounds who might need more help.\n\nSo, considering all these options, I need to decide which one best explains why comprehensive schools didn't eradicate class inequalities in education in the 1960s.\n\nLet me see. Comprehensive schools were supposed to provide a single school type for all students, regardless of ability, to reduce social segregation. But if selective schools were still able to take the most able pupils, as in option B, that means that comprehensive schools were still being left with a higher proportion of lower-ability students, or at least that's how it might have played out in practice. This could maintain a divide between students from different social classes, as higher-ability students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds might be more likely to get into selective schools.\n\nMoreover, if comprehensive schools were streaming students by ability, that could create inequalities within the school. Higher-ability streams might get better resources, more experienced teachers, or more opportunities, leaving lower-ability streams with fewer advantages. This sort of internal stratification could mirror and reinforce broader class inequalities.\n\nOption A, recruiting from inner cities and working-class areas, might contribute to inequalities if those areas have fewer resources, but it's not directly about the school system's ability to erase class differences in education.\n\nOption C seems to be about communication styles in the classroom, which could create barriers for some students, but it's not clear how this directly affects class inequalities in education overall.\n\nOption D mentions league tables and competition, which became more prominent later on, but I'm not sure how much of an impact they had in the 1960s. Maybe they were starting to influence education policies, but I think their influence grew more in the following decades.\n\nGiven this, I think option B is the most accurate explanation. Selective schools taking the most able pupils meant that comprehensive schools had to deal with a wider range of abilities, and the practice of streaming by ability within comprehensive schools could have contributed to maintaining class inequalities.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. Was streaming by ability a common practice in comprehensive schools in the 1960s? I think it was. Many comprehensive schools organized students into different streams based on their perceived ability, often in subjects like math and English. This was intended to tailor instruction to different levels, but it sometimes led to students being tracked into paths that were difficult to change, potentially limiting opportunities for those in lower streams.\n\nAlso, if selective schools were still able to select the top students, whether through exams or other means, that would mean that comprehensive schools were not truly comprehensive in the sense of accepting all students without selection. This selective process could have favored students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds who had more resources to prepare for entrance exams.\n\nSo, yes, I believe option B is the correct answer. It directly addresses how the persistence of selective schools and the practice of ability streaming within comprehensive schools hindered the eradication of class inequalities in education during the 1960s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
