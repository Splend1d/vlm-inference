                    "text": "Let's see what these questions are about. It's about decidability, which is a concept in computability theory. A problem is decidable if there's an algorithm that can determine the answer for any instance of the problem in a finite amount of time.\n\nSo, the problems are related to the decimal expansion of \u03c0, which is an irrational number, meaning it has an infinite, non-repeating decimal expansion.\n\nLet's look at each one:\n\nI. Given a (finite) string w, is w a prefix of the decimal expansion of \u03c0?\n\nSo, for example, if w is \"3.14\", is that a prefix of \u03c0? Well, \u03c0 starts with 3.1415926..., so yes. What about \"14\"? Well, \u03c0 doesn't start with \"14\", so no.\n\nNow, is there an algorithm to decide this for any given string w?\n\nYes, because the decimal expansion of \u03c0 is well-defined, even if we don't know all its digits, we can generate them one by one and compare with w. Since w is finite, we only need to generate enough digits of \u03c0 to compare with w, and then check if they match.\n\nSo, this seems decidable.\n\nII. Given a program and an input, is the program\u2019s output the decimal expansion of \u03c0?\n\nThis sounds trickier. We have to determine if a program, when run with some input, outputs the decimal expansion of \u03c0.\n\nBut wait, the decimal expansion of \u03c0 is infinite. So, does \"output the decimal expansion of \u03c0\" mean that the program should keep outputting digits forever, following the sequence of \u03c0?\n\nIf that's the case, then checking if a program's output matches \u03c0 is equivalent to checking if, for every position n, the nth digit output by the program matches the nth digit of \u03c0.\n\nBut this is problematic because \u03c0 is infinite, and we can't check an infinite number of positions. Moreover, we might not even know what the program will output beyond some point if it runs indefinitely.\n\nThis seems undecidable because of the halting problem. We can't, in general, determine what a program will output for arbitrary input.\n\nSo, probably not decidable.\n\nIII. Given a program that takes as input a prefix of the decimal expansion of \u03c0, is the program\u2019s output always the same for every prefix?\n\nHmm, so we have a program that takes a prefix of \u03c0 as input and outputs something. We need to check if, no matter which prefix of \u03c0 we give it, the output is always the same.\n\nAgain, prefixes of \u03c0 are infinite in number because \u03c0 has an infinite decimal expansion.\n\nTo decide this, we'd need to check the program's behavior for all possible prefixes of \u03c0.\n\nBut since there are infinitely many prefixes (because each additional digit creates a new prefix), we can't check them all one by one.\n\nMoreover, we'd need to simulate the program for each prefix and see if the output is the same.\n\nBut without knowing the program, we can't predict its behavior for all prefixes.\n\nThis seems undecable as well, due to the same reasons as in problem II.\n\nSo, from this analysis, only problem I seems decidable.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. I only.\n\nWait, but let's double-check.\n\nIs there a way to decide, for any program, whether its output is always the same for every prefix of \u03c0?\n\nWell, if the program is trivial, like it always outputs a constant, then yes. But in general, without knowing the program, it's impossible to say.\n\nConsider that the program could do anything with the input prefix, and we can't predict its behavior for all possible prefixes.\n\nHence, it's undecidable.\n\nSimilarly, for problem II, determining if a program's output is the decimal expansion of \u03c0 is undecidable because it involves checking if the program generates \u03c0 correctly indefinitely, which we can't do in finite time.\n\nTherefore, only problem I is decidable.\n\nSo, the answer is A. I only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
