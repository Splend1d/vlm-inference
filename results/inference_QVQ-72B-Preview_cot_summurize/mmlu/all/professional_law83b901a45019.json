Although a number of lawyers applied for the position, one of the applicants submitted a particularly impressive resume. The dean of faculty for the law school immediately wrote to the applicant to offer him the position. In the letter, the dean offered to employ the applicant for the upcoming academic year, which started on August 15, at a salary of $75,000. The letter also listed the employment terms and conditions, one of which stated that professors are entitled to five paid sick days during the year. The dean included a detailed employment contract containing all these terms, for the applicant's signature. After the applicant received this letter, he replied by mail, requesting a salary of $85,000 and sick leave of 10 days. Upon receipt of the applicant's letter, the dean telephoned the applicant and told him that the law school followed the American Bar Association guidelines with respect to salary and sick leave for its professors. The applicant acquiesced on the salary question, but insisted that his sick leave be extended to 10 days. The dean replied, \"Let's not permit a minor issue to stand in the way of your coming to teach at our law school. In the event you require more than 5 sick days, I promise that the matter will be taken care of to your benefit. \" The applicant informed the dean that he would sign the contract and forward it to the dean, which he promptly did. The applicant began teaching at the law school on August 15. Three months later, the applicant was out sick for five days with laryngitis. The applicant did not miss another school day until Monday, March 8, when he fell ill with food poisoning. This illness kept him home for five additional sick days. The applicant returned to work on March 15. When the applicant received his salary check at the end of the week, his check did not include payment for the previous week (from March 8 to March 12). Accompanying the check was a statement that read:\"Salary payment for period from Monday, March 1 through Friday, March 19 with pro rata deduction to reflect five teaching days missed during said period. \"When the applicant received his check, he immediately confronted the dean and requested full payment for the week of March 8 through 12. The dean responded, \"I'm sorry, but there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. \"The applicant asserted a claim against the law school for breach of contract. The applicant offers to introduce evidence that during his telephone conversation with dean of faculty, the dean promised, if necessary, to provide him with additional sick days.

                    "text": "Alright, I've got this legal scenario to work through. It's about a contract between a law school and a professor, and there's some dispute over sick leave and salary. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the law school advertised for a legal ethics and jurisprudence professor. Several lawyers applied, but one stood out with an impressive resume. The dean offered this applicant a position for the upcoming academic year starting on August 15, at a salary of $75,000. The offer letter also mentioned that professors are entitled to five paid sick days during the year. The dean included a detailed employment contract for the applicant to sign.\n\nThe applicant received the offer letter and replied by mail, requesting a higher salary of $85,000 and more sick leave\u201410 days instead of five. The dean then called the applicant and explained that the law school follows the American Bar Association guidelines for salary and sick leave. The applicant agreed to the salary but insisted on 10 sick days. The dean tried to reassure the applicant that any issues with sick leave beyond the standard five days would be handled to the applicant's benefit.\n\nDespite this conversation, the applicant signed the contract and sent it back to the dean. So, the written contract presumably states that professors get five paid sick days, right? But there was this oral agreement or understanding that if the applicant needed more than five days, it would be taken care of.\n\nNow, the applicant started teaching on August 15 and took five sick days in February for laryngitis and another five in March for food poisoning, making a total of ten sick days. When he received his salary check at the end of the week covering March 8 to 12, his check didn't include payment for those five days. The law school deducted payment for those days, citing the contract's provision for five paid sick days.\n\nThe applicant argues that based on the dean's promise during their phone conversation, he should have been given ten paid sick days. The dean, however, says there's nothing he can do about it.\n\nSo, the applicant is claiming breach of contract, saying that the dean promised to provide him with additional sick days if needed.\n\nNow, the question is about the admissibility of parol evidence\u2014oral agreements or statements made outside of the written contract\u2014to prove or vary the terms of the written contract.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Parol evidence is admissible to show that the parties assented to their written contract only as a partial integration of their complete contract.\n\nB. Parol evidence is admissible to prove a subsequent oral agreement that varies or contradicts the terms of a prior written contract.\n\nC. Parol evidence is admissible to show that the written contract is not enforceable because of undue influence or fraud.\n\nD. Parol evidence is inadmissible to prove contemporaneous oral agreements that vary or contradict the terms of a written contract.\n\nI need to figure out which statement accurately reflects the situation regarding the dean's oral promise.\n\nFirst, I should recall the parol evidence rule. Generally, the parol evidence rule provides that when parties have reduced their agreement to a writing that is intended to be the final and complete expression of their agreement, prior or contemporaneous oral agreements that contradict the written agreement are generally inadmissible to vary or contradict the terms of the written agreement.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to this rule. Parol evidence may be admissible to explain ambiguous terms in the written contract, to show that the written contract is not the complete agreement (i.e., it's a partial integration), or to prove fraud, duress, or other defects in the agreement.\n\nIn this scenario, the applicant is trying to introduce evidence of the dean's oral promise to provide additional sick days beyond the five specified in the written contract.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Parol evidence is admissible to show that the parties assented to their written contract only as a partial integration of their complete contract.\n\nThis suggests that the written contract doesn't include all the terms agreed upon, and there are additional terms that were orally agreed upon. In this case, the oral promise about sick leave could be considered an additional term that was part of the complete agreement but not included in the written contract. So, if the parties intended the written contract to be a partial integration, parol evidence could be used to introduce these additional terms.\n\nB. Parol evidence is admissible to prove a subsequent oral agreement that varies or contradicts the terms of a prior written contract.\n\nThis seems relevant because the oral agreement about sick leave was made after the initial written offer and before the signing of the contract. It's a bit confusing whether it's a subsequent agreement or a contemporaneous one. But generally, parol evidence is not admissible to vary or contradict the terms of a written agreement unless there are specific exceptions, like fraud or partial integration.\n\nC. Parol evidence is admissible to show that the written contract is not enforceable because of undue influence or fraud.\n\nThis option relates to situations where there might be something wrong with how the contract was formed, like one party being unduly influenced or fraudulently induced to agree to the terms. In this scenario, there's no indication of undue influence or fraud. The applicant and the dean seem to have had a straightforward negotiation over salary and sick leave.\n\nD. Parol evidence is inadmissible to prove contemporaneous oral agreements that vary or contradict the terms of a written contract.\n\nThis is a statement of the general parol evidence rule. It says that oral agreements made at the same time as the written contract cannot be used to change or contradict what's written in the contract. However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as when the written contract is not intended to be the complete agreement.\n\nGiven this, I need to determine which option best describes the situation regarding the dean's oral promise.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the written contract is intended to be the complete agreement between the parties. If it is, then generally, parol evidence cannot be used to add terms or vary the terms of the contract.\n\nHowever, if the written contract is only a partial integration, meaning that the parties intended for there to be additional terms that were not included in the written document, then parol evidence may be admissible to show those additional terms.\n\nIn this scenario, the dean and the applicant had a conversation after the applicant's counteroffer, where the dean discussed the sick leave issue and promised to handle it to the applicant's benefit if needed.\n\nSo, the question is whether this oral promise is part of the complete agreement or whether it's an agreement outside the written contract that can be enforced.\n\nOption A suggests that parol evidence is admissible to show that the written contract is only a partial integration of the complete agreement. If that's the case, then the oral promise about sick leave could be considered part of the complete agreement and enforceable.\n\nOption B mentions subsequent oral agreements that vary or contradict the terms of a prior written contract. In this scenario, the oral agreement about sick leave was made after the initial written offer but before the signing of the contract. So, it's not exactly a subsequent agreement after the contract was signed, but it's part of the negotiation process.\n\nOption D states that parol evidence is inadmissible to prove contemporaneous oral agreements that vary or contradict the terms of a written contract. This seems to align with the general parol evidence rule. However, as mentioned earlier, there are exceptions, such as when the written contract is not intended to be the complete agreement.\n\nGiven that, option A seems most relevant because it relates to the idea that the written contract may not include all the terms of the agreement, and parol evidence can be used to show that there are additional terms that were agreed upon orally.\n\nOption B might not be the best fit because the oral agreement was part of the negotiation process and not a separate agreement after the contract was signed.\n\nOption C is not applicable because there's no indication of undue influence or fraud.\n\nOption D is the general rule, but in this case, it might not be the most accurate statement because the oral agreement could be considered part of the complete agreement if the written contract is only a partial integration.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement concerning the dean's oral promise would be option A: parol evidence is admissible to show that the parties assented to their written contract only as a partial integration of their complete contract.\n\nThis would allow the applicant to introduce evidence of the oral promise to provide additional sick days beyond the five specified in the written contract, arguing that this was part of the complete agreement between the parties.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
