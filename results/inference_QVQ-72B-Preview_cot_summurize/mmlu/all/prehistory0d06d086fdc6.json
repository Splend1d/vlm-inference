                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Montezuma ruled over millions of people from the _______ capital of _____.\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Maya; Tikal.\n\nB. Aztec; Tenochtitl\u00e1n.\n\nC. Teotihuac\u00e1nos; Teotihuac\u00e1n.\n\nD. Zapotec; Monte Alb\u00e1n.\n\nAlright, I need to figure out which of these is correct. I know that Montezuma was a powerful ruler, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.\n\nFirst off, Montezuma is a name I've heard before, but I don't remember which civilization he led. Let me think... I think he was an Aztec emperor. Yeah, that sounds familiar. The Aztecs were in Mexico, right? And their capital was Tenochtitl\u00e1n. So, option B seems plausible.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption A is Maya; Tikal. I know the Maya had a great civilization with cities like Tikal, but I don't recall Montezuma being part of the Maya. I think the Maya were more in Central America, and the Aztecs were in what is now Mexico. So, probably not.\n\nOption C is Teotihuac\u00e1nos; Teotihuac\u00e1n. I've heard of Teotihuac\u00e1n; it's an ancient city in Mexico, known for its massive pyramids. But again, I don't remember Montezuma being associated with them. I think Teotihuac\u00e1n was before the Aztecs, maybe?\n\nOption D is Zapotec; Monte Alb\u00e1n. The Zapotecs were another Mesoamerican civilization, known for Monte Alb\u00e1n. But again, I don't think Montezuma was part of the Zapotec civilization.\n\nSo, based on my knowledge, it seems like Montezuma was an Aztec ruler, and their capital was Tenochtitl\u00e1n. Therefore, the correct choice should be B. Aztec; Tenochtitl\u00e1n.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll recall some more information. The Aztecs were a powerful empire in central Mexico in the 14th to 16th centuries. Their capital, Tenochtitl\u00e1n, was built on an island in Lake Texcoco and was connected to the mainland by causeways. It was a vast city with temples, markets, and palaces.\n\nMontezuma, or Moctezuma, was actually two different Aztec emperors: Moctezuma I and Moctezuma II. Moctezuma II was the one who was ruling when the Spanish conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s arrived in Mexico in 1519.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty confident that Montezuma was an Aztec ruler, and Tenochtitl\u00e1n was their capital. Therefore, the answer is B. Aztec; Tenochtitl\u00e1n.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
