                    "text": "So I've got this situation here about a homeowner and a real estate broker. The homeowner signed a six-month exclusive-right-to-sell listing agreement with the broker. That means, for six months, only this broker can sell the house, and if they do, they get a commission. The agreement says the broker gets paid a commission if the house sells during that time.\n\nThe broker did what they were supposed to do: they marketed the house right away, spending money on it. But then, five months into the listing period, the homeowner accepts an offer from their cousin without involving the broker. The broker only finds out about this after the house has been sold to the cousin, and this happens one month after the listing period ended.\n\nSo, the question is, is the broker entitled to any payment?\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, what does an exclusive-right-to-sell listing mean? It's a type of listing where the broker has the exclusive right to sell the property for a specified period. If the property is sold during that period, even if the homeowner finds the buyer themselves, the broker still gets their commission.\n\nIn this case, the listing period was six months, and the broker was supposed to get a commission if the house sold during that time.\n\nNow, the homeowner accepted an offer from their cousin five months into the listing period, which is still within the six-month window. But they didn't involve the broker in this transaction.\n\nThe sale actually closed one month after the listing period expired. So, the acceptance of the offer was during the listing period, but the closing was after.\n\nDoes that matter? I think it does.\n\nIn real estate, the commission is typically earned when the sale is executed, not when the offer is accepted. But sometimes, listing agreements specify that if an offer is accepted during the listing period, the broker is entitled to the commission, even if the closing happens later.\n\nBut I need to look at the specific terms of the listing agreement. The problem says that the listing agreement provided for the payment of a commission if the home sold during the listing period.\n\nSo, according to this, if the home is sold during the listing period, the broker gets their commission.\n\nThe homeowner accepted an offer during the listing period, which led to the sale after the listing period ended.\n\nSo, the sale was agreed upon during the listing period, but the actual transfer happened later.\n\nIs the broker entitled to the commission?\n\nOption A says no, because the broker engaged in no negotiations with the cousin.\n\nBut, the listing is exclusive right to sell, which means the broker has the right to earn the commission if the property is sold during the listing period, regardless of who brings the buyer, as long as the broker was properly performing their duties.\n\nSince the broker was marketing the property and incurring expenses, and the homeowner went behind the broker's back to sell to the cousin during the listing period, the broker might still be entitled to the commission.\n\nOption B says no, because the closing occurred after the listing period had expired.\n\nBut, if the listing agreement says that the commission is due if the home is sold during the listing period, and the sale was agreed upon during that period, then the broker should get their commission, even if the closing is after.\n\nOption C says yes, but only reimbursement for her expenses.\n\nBut, the broker is entitled to a commission if the home is sold during the listing period, not just reimbursement for expenses.\n\nOption D says yes, the full commission, because the homeowner accepted the cousin's offer to purchase during the listing period.\n\nThis seems to align with the terms of the listing agreement.\n\nBut, I need to make sure.\n\nLet me think about it differently.\n\nSuppose the broker had found a buyer during the listing period, but the closing took place after the listing period ended. Would the broker still get their commission?\n\nProbably, because the sale was agreed upon during the listing period.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, the homeowner found the buyer (their cousin) during the listing period, without involving the broker.\n\nBut, since it's an exclusive-right-to-sell listing, the broker has the right to the commission if the property is sold during that period, regardless of who finds the buyer.\n\nSo, even though the homeowner found the buyer themselves, during the listing period, the broker should still get their commission.\n\nMoreover, the broker had been marketing the property and incurring expenses, which suggests they were fulfilling their part of the agreement.\n\nTherefore, the broker is entitled to the full commission.\n\nWait, but the closing happened after the listing period ended. Does that make a difference?\n\nI don't think so, as long as the sale was agreed upon during the listing period.\n\nIn real estate, the commission is typically earned when the sale contract is signed, not when the closing occurs.\n\nSo, if the sale contract was signed during the listing period, the broker has earned their commission.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D: yes, the full commission, because the homeowner accepted the cousin's offer to purchase during the listing period.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
