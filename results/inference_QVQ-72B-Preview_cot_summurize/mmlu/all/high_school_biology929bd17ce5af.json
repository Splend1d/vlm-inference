                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about two trees of the same species growing close together and using the same resources like light, water, and nutrients. If resources are limited, each tree gets less than if they were farther apart. The question is, what's this an example of? The options are parasitism, commensalism, natural selection, or intraspecific competition.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with parasitism: that's when one organism, the parasite, benefits at the expense of another organism, the host. So, like a tapeworm living inside a dog or something. In this case, the trees are both getting resources, but they're competing for them. Neither is benefiting at the expense of the other directly. So, parasitism doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nNext, commensalism. I think this is when one species benefits while the other is neither helped nor harmed significantly. Like, barnacles attaching to whales. The barnacles get a free ride and access to food, but the whale isn't helped or harmed much by this. In the case of the trees, both are affected by the competition for resources. So, commensalism doesn't seem right either.\n\nThen there's natural selection. This is a process where individuals that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. It's a key mechanism of evolution. In this scenario, we have two trees competing for resources. If one tree is better at accessing resources, say it's taller and gets more light, it might grow better and produce more seeds. That sounds like natural selection is at play, but the question is asking for the best example, so maybe it's not the primary answer.\n\nLastly, intraspecific competition. The prefix \"intra-\" means within, and \"specific\" refers to species. So, intraspecific competition is competition within the same species for resources. That sounds a lot like what's happening here\u2014two trees of the same species growing close together and competing for light, water, and nutrients.\n\nLet me double-check. Parasitism is about one organism living off another, commensalism is one benefiting without affecting the other much, natural selection is about adaptation and survival advantages, and intraspecific competition is about competition within the same species.\n\nGiven that, the scenario describes two trees of the same species competing for limited resources, which is directly related to intraspecific competition.\n\nWait a minute, could it also be considered natural selection? Because if one tree is better at competing for resources, say due to better root systems or taller growth, it might have a selective advantage.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking about the competition between the two trees, not about the selection of traits that allow one tree to outcompete the other.\n\nSo, perhaps intraspecific competition is the more immediate description of what's happening, and natural selection would be the longer-term evolutionary consequence of such competition.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer to the question is intraspecific competition.\n\nI think the answer is D. Intraspecific competition.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
