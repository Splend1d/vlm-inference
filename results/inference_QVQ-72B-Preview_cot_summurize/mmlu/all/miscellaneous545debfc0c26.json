                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to figure out the slowest wind speed that qualifies for a hurricane according to the Saffir-Simpson scale. The options are 50 mph, 74 mph, 96 mph, and 110 mph. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think I remember that the Saffir-Simpson scale categorizes hurricanes based on their wind speeds, and there are different categories from 1 to 5.\n\nFirst, I should recall what the Saffir-Simpson scale is. It's a classification used to measure the intensity of hurricanes, particularly in the Atlantic and Northeastern Pacific basins. It's based primarily on a storm's maximum sustained wind speed. The scale has five categories, with Category 1 being the least intense and Category 5 being the most intense.\n\nNow, I need to find out what the minimum wind speed is for a storm to be considered a hurricane at all, not just a tropical storm or something else. I think there's a difference between a tropical storm and a hurricane based on wind speed.\n\nLet me think about the classifications of tropical cyclones. Starting from the lowest intensity, there are tropical depressions, then tropical storms, and then hurricanes. So, a tropical depression has winds less than 39 mph, I believe. Then a tropical storm has winds from 39 mph to 73 mph. After that, it becomes a hurricane when the winds reach 74 mph or higher.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check. I think the threshold for a hurricane is 74 mph. So, would that mean that 74 mph is the slowest a hurricane can be?\n\nBut I also recall something about different categories within hurricanes. For example, Category 1 hurricanes have winds from 74 to 95 mph, Category 2 from 96 to 110 mph, and so on up to Category 5. So, if that's the case, then the slowest wind speed for a hurricane would be 74 mph, which would be a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other factor that could affect this? For instance, maybe the central pressure or some other aspect could allow a storm to be classified as a hurricane even if the winds are below 74 mph? I don't think so. I believe wind speed is the primary criterion for classification.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider if there are any regional variations in the definition. For example, in the Australian region, they use the Australian scale, which might have different thresholds. But since the question specifies the Saffir-Simpson scale, which is used in the Atlantic and Northeastern Pacific, I think the 74 mph threshold should apply.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the conversion between units, because sometimes wind speeds are measured in knots or meters per second, especially in international contexts. But in the options provided, all the speeds are in miles per hour, so that should be straightforward.\n\nWait a minute, just to be thorough, I should confirm the exact thresholds for the Saffir-Simpson scale. I think the National Hurricane Center provides this information.\n\nIf I recall correctly, the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale defines a hurricane as having sustained winds of at least 74 mph. So, any storm with winds below that would be considered a tropical storm or a tropical depression, not a hurricane.\n\nTherefore, the slowest wind speed a hurricane can have according to the Saffir-Simpson scale is 74 mph.\n\nJust to cross-verify, let's look at the categories:\n\n- Category 1: 74-95 mph\n\n- Category 2: 96-110 mph\n\n- Category 3: 111-129 mph\n\n- Category 4: 130-156 mph\n\n- Category 5: 157 mph or higher\n\nSo, yes, 74 mph is the starting point for a hurricane, which is Category 1.\n\nI think I've got it right. The answer should be B. 74 m.p.h.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 74 \\ \\text{m.p.h.}} \\]"
