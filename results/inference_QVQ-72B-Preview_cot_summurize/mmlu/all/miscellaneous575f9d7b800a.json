Okay, I need to figure out which one is not part of NAFTA.\n\nFirst off, I know that NAFTA is the North American Free Trade Agreement. It's a trade agreement between some countries in North America. Let me think about which countries are included. I'm pretty sure it's the United States, Canada, and Mexico. But let's make sure.\n\nI remember that NAFTA was established in 1994 to eliminate trade barriers between these three countries. So, if I recall correctly, the member countries are indeed the United States, Canada, and Mexico. But just to be thorough, I should check if Guatemala is also a part of it.\n\nWait a minute, Guatemala is a country in Central America, not North America. So, geographically, it's separate from North America. NAFTA is specifically a North American trade agreement, so it's unlikely that Guatemala is part of it.\n\nLet me double-check this. Maybe there's some extension or something that includes Guatemala indirectly. But no, I don't think so. The main members are clearly the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\n\nSo, based on this, Guatemala is not a participant in NAFTA. Therefore, the answer should be D. Guatemala.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, I'll quickly look it up in my notes. Here it is: \"NAFTA is a trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\" No mention of Guatemala there.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The correct answer is D. Guatemala.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
