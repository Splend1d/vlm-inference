                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Richard Hakluyt and his ideas on English colonization in America. The passage is from 1582, and he's basically arguing that England should establish colonies in America, which at that time was mostly controlled by the Spanish and Portuguese. He seems to think that England has a right and an opportunity to claim parts of America that aren't yet controlled by these other European powers.\n\nThe question is asking what happened as a result of following Hakluyt's ideas. The options are:\n\nA. Drive the French and Portuguese governments into bankruptcy.\n\nB. Conquer large parts of Africa in the eighteenth century.\n\nC. Establish several colonies along the Atlantic coastline of North America.\n\nD. Destroy the Dutch commercial empire.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Hakluyt was advocating for. From the passage, it's clear that he's encouraging England to set up colonies in America, particularly in areas that aren't yet controlled by the Spanish or Portuguese. He mentions that America was first discovered over eighty years ago, which would place the discovery around 1492, the year Columbus sailed to the New World.\n\nHakluyt seems to be regretful that England hasn't been more active in claiming these new lands, especially since he believes they have a rightful claim to them. He also hints at the economic and strategic benefits of having colonies there.\n\nNow, considering that this passage is from 1582, and England did go on to establish colonies in North America, starting with places like Jamestown in 1607 and the Plymouth Colony in 1620, it makes sense that following Hakluyt's ideas would lead to English colonization along the Atlantic coast of North America.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that by following Hakluyt's ideas, England was able to drive the French and Portuguese governments into bankruptcy. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. The French and Portuguese were major colonial powers, and while they certainly faced challenges from England, I don't recall that they went bankrupt because of English colonization in America.\n\nOption B suggests that England conquered large parts of Africa in the eighteenth century. While it's true that England did acquire territories in Africa later on, such as in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Hakluyt's focus in this passage is on America and other undiscovered regions, not specifically on Africa. So, this seems like a stretch.\n\nOption C proposes that England established several colonies along the Atlantic coastline of North America. This seems directly aligned with what Hakluyt is suggesting in the passage. The English did found colonies in what is now the eastern United States, which were part of their American empire.\n\nOption D states that England destroyed the Dutch commercial empire. While England did have conflicts with the Dutch, particularly in the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the seventeenth century, which helped England gain dominance over the Dutch in some colonial areas, I don't think that following Hakluyt's ideas specifically led to the destruction of the Dutch commercial empire.\n\nGiven this analysis, option C seems to be the most straightforward and direct consequence of following Hakluyt's ideas as presented in the passage. He is explicitly advocating for English colonization in America, and history shows that England did establish multiple colonies along the Atlantic coast of North America.\n\nI should also consider the timing. Hakluyt wrote this in 1582, and the first permanent English settlement in North America was Jamestown in 1607, which is consistent with the idea that his writings influenced or reflected the growing interest in colonization.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Establish several colonies along the Atlantic coastline of North America.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
