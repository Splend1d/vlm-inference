                    "text": "So I have this question here about pre-testing a questionnaire. It says that pre-testing is useful for:\n\nA. finding out which topics are important to the respondents\n\nB. testing out your computer and printer\n\nC. identifying any problems with the question wording and routing\n\nD. deciding which respondents to leave out of the final sample\n\nAnd I need to pick which one is correct. Okay, let's think about this.\n\nFirst off, what's the purpose of pre-testing a questionnaire? Well, from what I remember, pre-testing is like a trial run before you do the actual survey. It's a way to catch any issues or problems with the questionnaire before you send it out to a large group of people.\n\nSo, option A says it's for finding out which topics are important to the respondents. Hmm, that seems a bit off. I think pre-testing is more about checking the clarity and understanding of the questions, not necessarily determining what's important to the respondents. Maybe that's not the primary purpose.\n\nOption B is about testing out your computer and printer. That sounds more like a technical check, making sure your equipment is working properly. While that's important, I don't think that's the main reason for pre-testing a questionnaire. Maybe it's something you do alongside pre-testing, but it's not the primary goal.\n\nOption C is about identifying any problems with the question wording and routing. This sounds promising. Question wording can be tricky; sometimes, questions might be unclear or leading, and you might not realize it until you see how people respond. Routing refers to the flow of the questionnaire, right? Like, which questions come next based on previous answers. That can get complicated, especially in online surveys with skip logic. So, pre-testing would help iron out any kinks in the wording and the flow of the questions.\n\nOption D is about deciding which respondents to leave out of the final sample. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Pre-testing is usually done with a small group to test the questionnaire, but the final sample is supposed to be representative of the population you're studying. Deciding to leave out certain respondents based on pre-testing seems unethical and not in line with standard research practices. So, I think this is definitely not the purpose of pre-testing.\n\nSo, between options A, B, and C, option C seems the most relevant. Pre-testing is primarily about identifying and fixing problems with the questionnaire itself, particularly with the wording of the questions and the routing or flow of the survey.\n\nLet me double-check this. If I recall correctly, pre-testing involves giving the questionnaire to a small group of people who are similar to the target population and observing how they respond. Researchers then collect feedback on the clarity of the questions, the time it takes to complete the survey, and any confusion about the instructions or the routing of questions. Based on this feedback, they make necessary adjustments before distributing the final version of the questionnaire to the larger sample.\n\nSo, this aligns perfectly with option C: identifying any problems with the question wording and routing.\n\nOption A, finding out which topics are important to the respondents, seems more related to the content validity of the questionnaire or perhaps the prioritization of questions based on importance, but that's not typically the main goal of pre-testing.\n\nOption B, testing out your computer and printer, is more of a logistical check and isn't directly related to the content or design of the questionnaire.\n\nOption D, deciding which respondents to leave out of the final sample, suggests some form of bias or pre-judging, which isn't appropriate in research settings.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: identifying any problems with the question wording and routing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
