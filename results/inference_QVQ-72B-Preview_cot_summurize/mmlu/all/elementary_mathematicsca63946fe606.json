                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a stock price starting at $24.75 on Monday morning. Then, over the next five days, it goes up and down by certain amounts each day. I need to find out what the price is at the end of Friday.\n\nFirst, I should list out all the changes that happen each day:\n\n- Monday: gained $2.50\n\n- Tuesday: lost $3.25\n\n- Wednesday: lost $0.75\n\n- Thursday: gained $1.25\n\n- Friday: gained $4.75\n\nSo, these changes are added or subtracted to the starting price. My goal is to apply each of these changes in sequence to find the final price.\n\nLet me start with Monday:\n\nStarting price = $24.75\n\nMonday change: +$2.50\n\nSo, after Monday, the price should be $24.75 + $2.50 = $27.25.\n\nNext, Tuesday: lost $3.25.\n\nSo, subtract $3.25 from $27.25: $27.25 - $3.25 = $24.00.\n\nThen, Wednesday: lost another $0.75.\n\nSubtract $0.75 from $24.00: $24.00 - $0.75 = $23.25.\n\nOn Thursday: gained $1.25.\n\nAdd $1.25 to $23.25: $23.25 + $1.25 = $24.50.\n\nFinally, Friday: gained $4.75.\n\nAdd $4.75 to $24.50: $24.50 + $4.75 = $29.25.\n\nSo, the final price at the end of Friday is $29.25.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I added and subtracted all the amounts correctly.\n\nStarting at $24.75.\n\nMonday: +$2.50 \u2192 $24.75 + 2.50 = $27.25.\n\nTuesday: -$3.25 \u2192 $27.25 - 3.25 = $24.00.\n\nWednesday: -$0.75 \u2192 $24.00 - 0.75 = $23.25.\n\nThursday: +$1.25 \u2192 $23.25 + 1.25 = $24.50.\n\nFriday: +$4.75 \u2192 $24.50 + 4.75 = $29.25.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could add up all the daily changes and then apply them to the starting price.\n\nLet's sum up the changes:\n\nMonday: +2.50\n\nTuesday: -3.25\n\nWednesday: -0.75\n\nThursday: +1.25\n\nFriday: +4.75\n\nTotal change = +2.50 - 3.25 - 0.75 + 1.25 + 4.75.\n\nLet me add these step by step:\n\nStart with +2.50.\n\nSubtract 3.25: 2.50 - 3.25 = -0.75.\n\nThen subtract another 0.75: -0.75 - 0.75 = -1.50.\n\nThen add 1.25: -1.50 + 1.25 = -0.25.\n\nFinally, add 4.75: -0.25 + 4.75 = +4.50.\n\nSo, the total change over the week is +$4.50.\n\nNow, add this total change to the starting price:\n\n$24.75 + $4.50 = $29.25.\n\nOkay, this matches what I got earlier.\n\nI should also make sure that I'm not missing anything in the problem. It says \"at the beginning of the week\" and \"over the next five days.\" Assuming that the changes happen each day, and the price adjusts accordingly.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $12.25\n\nB. $25.75\n\nC. $29.25\n\nD. $37.25\n\nMy calculation leads to $29.25, which is option C.\n\nI don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is $29.25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{29.25} \\]"
