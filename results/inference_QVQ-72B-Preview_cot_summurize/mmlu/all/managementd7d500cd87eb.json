It says, \"What is the term for power derived from status or position in an organization?\" And the options are Referent, Expert, Reward, and Legitimate. Hmm, I need to think about this.\n\nFirst off, I know that power in organizations can come from different sources. There are a few types of power that are commonly talked about in organizational behavior. Let me recall what each type is about.\n\nStarting with Referent power. I think this is when someone has power because others admire them or identify with them. Like, if you respect someone and want to be like them, you might follow their lead not because they have authority, but because you look up to them. So, Referent power seems more about personal appeal rather than formal position.\n\nNext, Expert power. This one is about having knowledge or expertise that others don't have. So, if someone is really good at something, and others know that, they might listen to that person's advice or suggestions. Again, this seems more related to personal attributes rather than official status.\n\nThen there's Reward power. This is when someone has the ability to give rewards or benefits to others. For example, a manager who can give raises or promotions has Reward power. But, this seems tied to position because usually, only people in certain roles can give rewards.\n\nLastly, Legitimate power. This sounds like it's about having authority because of one's position in the organization. Like, a manager has the right to make decisions and give orders because they're in charge. It's part of their job.\n\nSo, the question is asking about power that comes from status or position. Let me see which one fits best.\n\nReferent power is from personal admiration, not position.\n\nExpert power is from knowledge, not position.\n\nReward power is from the ability to give rewards, which is often tied to position.\n\nLegitimate power is directly from the position itself.\n\nHmm, both Reward and Legitimate seem related to position, but Reward power is more about the ability to give rewards, whereas Legitimate power is about the right to make decisions and give orders just because of the position.\n\nThe question specifies \"status or position,\" which could encompass both, but maybe one of these is a better fit.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose there's a manager who tells their employees to do something. The employees comply because the manager has the authority to tell them what to do\u2014that's Legitimate power. If the manager offers a bonus for completing the task, that's Reward power.\n\nSo, both could be derived from position, but the question is specifically about power derived from status or position.\n\nWait a minute, maybe Legitimate power is more directly related to status or position because it's about the inherent right to command that comes with the position, whereas Reward power is about the specific ability to offer incentives, which is also position-based but more specific.\n\nPerhaps Legitimate power is the best answer here because it directly pertains to the authority that comes with the position, without needing to offer rewards or have expert knowledge.\n\nLet me check a quick reference to confirm. Oh, since I'm doing this exercise, I should think about it based on standard organizational behavior theories.\n\nIn organizational behavior, French and Raven identified five bases of power: Reward, Coercive, Legitimate, Expert, and Referent. Let's focus on Legitimate power.\n\nLegitimate power is indeed derived from the formal authority that a position holds. It's based on the organization's structure and the role that a person occupies. So, if someone has a certain title or position, they have Legitimate power by virtue of that position.\n\nReward power, while also position-related, is specifically about the ability to give positive reinforcements or incentives. It's still connected to position, but it's not solely about status or position; it's about the power to reward.\n\nExpert power is based on specialized knowledge or skills, which can be possessed by anyone, regardless of position.\n\nReferent power is based on identification with or admiration for the individual, which again isn't directly tied to position.\n\nTherefore, the term that best fits power derived from status or position in an organization is Legitimate power.\n\nI think the answer is D. Legitimate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
