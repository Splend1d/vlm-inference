                    "text": "So I've got this problem about light going through slits and creating bright fringes on a screen. The setup has two very narrow slits that are 0.5 micrometers apart. The light from a laser hits these slits, and on a screen far away, I see bright fringes separated by 1.0 millimeters. Now, if I double the frequency of the laser light, what will be the new separation of these bright fringes? The options are A. 0.25 mm, B. 0.5 mm, C. 1.0 mm, and D. 2.0 mm.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall the formula that relates the fringe spacing to the properties of the light and the slits. I remember that when light passes through two slits, it creates an interference pattern on a screen. The bright fringes are places where the waves from the two slits reinforce each other.\n\nThe formula for the position of the bright fringes in a double-slit experiment is:\n\n\\[y = \\frac{\\lambda D}{d}\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(y\\) is the position of the fringe on the screen.\n\n- \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of the light.\n\n- \\(D\\) is the distance from the slits to the screen.\n\n- \\(d\\) is the distance between the slits.\n\nBut since we're talking about the separation between bright fringes, I think it's more accurate to use the formula for the fringe spacing, which is:\n\n\\[\\Delta y = \\frac{\\lambda D}{d}\\]\n\nHere, \\(\\Delta y\\) is the separation between adjacent bright fringes, also known as the fringe spacing.\n\nGiven that, I have:\n\n- \\(d = 0.5\\) micrometers \\(= 0.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\) meters.\n\n- \\(\\Delta y = 1.0\\) millimeters \\(= 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\) meters.\n\nBut wait, I don't know \\(D\\) or \\(\\lambda\\), but maybe I don't need them explicitly for this problem.\n\nThe question says that if the frequency of the laser light is doubled, what will be the new separation of the bright fringes.\n\nI know that the relationship between wavelength (\\(\\lambda\\)), frequency (\\(f\\)), and the speed of light (\\(c\\)) is:\n\n\\[c = \\lambda f\\]\n\nSo, if the frequency is doubled, the wavelength will be halved, because the speed of light is constant.\n\nSo, \\(\\lambda_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\)\n\nNow, plugging this into the fringe spacing formula:\n\n\\[\\Delta y_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{new}} D}{d} = \\frac{(\\frac{\\lambda}{2}) D}{d} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{\\lambda D}{d} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\Delta y\\]\n\nTherefore, the new fringe spacing should be half of the original fringe spacing.\n\nGiven that the original separation was 1.0 mm, the new separation should be \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1.0 \\, \\text{mm} = 0.5 \\, \\text{mm}\\).\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 0.5 mm.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this reasoning.\n\nFirst, I recalled that in a double-slit experiment, the fringe spacing is given by \\(\\Delta y = \\frac{\\lambda D}{d}\\).\n\nThen, since \\(c = \\lambda f\\), doubling the frequency halves the wavelength.\n\nSo, substituting the new wavelength into the fringe spacing formula gives \\(\\Delta y_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta y\\).\n\nGiven \\(\\Delta y = 1.0 \\, \\text{mm}\\), then \\(\\Delta y_{\\text{new}} = 0.5 \\, \\text{mm}\\).\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the units and make sure everything checks out.\n\n\\(\\lambda\\) is in meters, \\(D\\) is in meters, \\(d\\) is in meters, and \\(\\Delta y\\) is in meters.\n\nDoubling the frequency halves \\(\\lambda\\), as \\(c\\) remains constant.\n\nSo, the relationship should hold.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 0.5 mm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 0.5\\ \\text{mm}} \\]"
