                    "text": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what's going on with Tommy from this rock opera. The situation is that he becomes deaf and blind after witnessing a terrible murder, but there's nothing wrong with his ears or eyes organically. So, it's like his body is causing these symptoms without any physical cause. I need to match this scenario with one of the psychological disorders listed: panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, conversion disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these disorders entails.\n\nStarting with panic disorder: I know that panic disorder is characterized by sudden and recurrent panic attacks, which are intense periods of fear or discomfort that peak within minutes. Symptoms can include heart palpitations, sweating, trembling, feelings of choking, and fears of losing control or dying. But in Tommy's case, the main issue isn't sudden attacks of fear; it's the loss of hearing and sight without organic cause. So, this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nNext, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): This is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. Symptoms include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, and uncontrollable thoughts about the event. While Tommy did witness a terrible murder, which is certainly traumatic, his symptoms are more physical\u2014deafness and blindness\u2014rather than psychological symptoms like flashbacks or anxiety. So, maybe PTSD isn't the best fit here, although trauma is a factor.\n\nThen there's conversion disorder. I'm not as familiar with this one, but I think it involves having symptoms of physical illness that can't be explained by a medical condition and are linked to psychological stress. Examples include paralysis, numbness, or problems with movement and sensation. It's like the mind converts psychological stress into physical symptoms. In Tommy's case, his deafness and blindness seem to fit this description\u2014they're physical symptoms with no organic basis, possibly resulting from the trauma of witnessing a murder.\n\nLastly, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): This is characterized by intrusive thoughts (obsessions) that lead to repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions) performed to reduce anxiety or distress. Symptoms might include repeated checking, handwashing, or counting. Again, Tommy's symptoms don't align with these; he's experiencing sensory losses, not obsessions or compulsions.\n\nSo, comparing all four options, conversion disorder seems to be the most fitting for Tommy's situation. His unexplained deafness and blindness following a traumatic event suggest that his psychological distress is being manifested as physical symptoms.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should consider if there's any other disorder that could cause such symptoms. For example, could there be a dissociative disorder that might involve loss of sensory functions? Dissociative disorders involve disruptions or breakdowns in memory, awareness, perception, or identity, often in response to stress or trauma. However, dissociative identity disorder, formerly known as multiple personality disorder, typically involves alterations in identity rather than sensory losses.\n\nAnother thought: could this be somatic symptom disorder? This is a condition where a person has physical symptoms for which there is no medical explanation, and they have excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to these symptoms. But again, the primary issue here is the unexplained deafness and blindness, which might be more specific to conversion disorder.\n\nI should also consider whether this might be a form of hysterical blindness or deafness, which are terms sometimes used to describe functional neurological symptoms without organic cause, often due to psychological factors. Conversion disorder is actually the term now used for such conditions.\n\nGiven all this, I'm leaning towards C. conversion disorder as the correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the definition of conversion disorder: it's a type of somatic symptom disorder where psychological stress is converted into physical symptoms, and there's no organic cause for these symptoms. In Tommy's case, his deafness and blindness have no organic basis, and they occurred after a traumatic event, which could be a significant source of psychological stress.\n\nSo, yeah, I think C. conversion disorder is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
