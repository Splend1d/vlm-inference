                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"Consider two positive even integers less than 15 (not necessarily distinct). When the sum of these two numbers is added to their product, how many different possible values may result?\"\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. We have two positive even integers, each less than 15, and they can be the same. So, possible numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14. That's seven numbers.\n\nWe're to take two of these, possibly the same, and then add their sum to their product. So, for numbers a and b, we're looking at a + b + a*b.\n\nI need to find out how many different possible values this expression can take.\n\nFirst, I should probably list all possible pairs of these numbers, since order doesn't matter and they can be the same, I think it's combinations with repetition.\n\nWait, since they can be the same, and order doesn't matter, it's combinations with repetition. The number of such pairs is C(7+2-1, 2) = C(8,2) = 28. But since they can be the same, it's actually 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 28 pairs. Wait, no, combinations with repetition for n=7 is (n+1 choose 2), which is 28.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way than listing all 28 and calculating a + b + ab for each.\n\nLet me think about the expression a + b + a*b. I can factor it: a + b + a*b = a*(1 + b) + b = a*b + a + b.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem immediately helpful. Maybe I can write it as (a + 1)(b + 1) - 1. Yeah, that's interesting.\n\na + b + a*b = a*b + a + b = (a + 1)(b + 1) - 1.\n\nThat's a useful identity. So, for each pair (a, b), the value is (a + 1)(b + 1) - 1.\n\nThis might make it easier to calculate and see patterns.\n\nNow, since a and b are from {2,4,6,8,10,12,14}, and order doesn't matter, I can consider all unique pairs and calculate (a + 1)(b + 1) - 1 for each, and see how many distinct results I get.\n\nBut 28 pairs is a bit tedious, maybe there's a pattern or some symmetry I can exploit.\n\nLet me list all possible pairs and calculate the expression.\n\nFirst, list all possible pairs:\n\n(2,2), (2,4), (2,6), (2,8), (2,10), (2,12), (2,14)\n\n(4,4), (4,6), (4,8), (4,10), (4,12), (4,14)\n\n(6,6), (6,8), (6,10), (6,12), (6,14)\n\n(8,8), (8,10), (8,12), (8,14)\n\n(10,10), (10,12), (10,14)\n\n(12,12), (12,14)\n\n(14,14)\n\nNow, calculate (a + 1)(b + 1) - 1 for each.\n\nLet's start with (2,2):\n\n(2+1)(2+1) - 1 = 3*3 -1 = 9 -1 = 8\n\n(2,4):\n\n(2+1)(4+1) -1 = 3*5 -1 = 15 -1 = 14\n\n(2,6):\n\n(2+1)(6+1) -1 = 3*7 -1 = 21 -1 = 20\n\n(2,8):\n\n(2+1)(8+1) -1 = 3*9 -1 = 27 -1 = 26\n\n(2,10):\n\n(2+1)(10+1) -1 = 3*11 -1 = 33 -1 = 32\n\n(2,12):\n\n(2+1)(12+1) -1 = 3*13 -1 = 39 -1 = 38\n\n(2,14):\n\n(2+1)(14+1) -1 = 3*15 -1 = 45 -1 = 44\n\nAlready, I have values: 8,14,20,26,32,38,44\n\nNow, (4,4):\n\n(4+1)(4+1) -1 = 5*5 -1 = 25 -1 = 24\n\n(4,6):\n\n(4+1)(6+1) -1 = 5*7 -1 = 35 -1 = 34\n\n(4,8):\n\n(4+1)(8+1) -1 = 5*9 -1 = 45 -1 = 44\n\nWait, that's the same as earlier.\n\n(4,10):\n\n(4+1)(10+1) -1 = 5*11 -1 = 55 -1 = 54\n\n(4,12):\n\n(4+1)(12+1) -1 = 5*13 -1 = 65 -1 = 64\n\n(4,14):\n\n(4+1)(14+1) -1 = 5*15 -1 = 75 -1 = 74\n\nSo new values: 24,34,54,64,74\n\nNow, (6,6):\n\n(6+1)(6+1) -1 = 7*7 -1 = 49 -1 = 48\n\n(6,8):\n\n(6+1)(8+1) -1 = 7*9 -1 = 63 -1 = 62\n\n(6,10):\n\n(6+1)(10+1) -1 = 7*11 -1 = 77 -1 = 76\n\n(6,12):\n\n(6+1)(12+1) -1 = 7*13 -1 = 91 -1 = 90\n\n(6,14):\n\n(6+1)(14+1) -1 = 7*15 -1 = 105 -1 = 104\n\nNew values: 48,62,76,90,104\n\nNext, (8,8):\n\n(8+1)(8+1) -1 = 9*9 -1 = 81 -1 = 80\n\n(8,10):\n\n(8+1)(10+1) -1 = 9*11 -1 = 99 -1 = 98\n\n(8,12):\n\n(8+1)(12+1) -1 = 9*13 -1 = 117 -1 = 116\n\n(8,14):\n\n(8+1)(14+1) -1 = 9*15 -1 = 135 -1 = 134\n\nNew values: 80,98,116,134\n\nThen, (10,10):\n\n(10+1)(10+1) -1 = 11*11 -1 = 121 -1 = 120\n\n(10,12):\n\n(10+1)(12+1) -1 = 11*13 -1 = 143 -1 = 142\n\n(10,14):\n\n(10+1)(14+1) -1 = 11*15 -1 = 165 -1 = 164\n\nNew values: 120,142,164\n\nFinally, (12,12):\n\n(12+1)(12+1) -1 = 13*13 -1 = 169 -1 = 168\n\n(12,14):\n\n(12+1)(14+1) -1 = 13*15 -1 = 195 -1 = 194\n\n(14,14):\n\n(14+1)(14+1) -1 = 15*15 -1 = 225 -1 = 224\n\nNew values: 168,194,224\n\nNow, compiling all distinct values from above:\n\n8,14,20,24,26,32,34,38,44,48,54,62,64,74,76,80,90,98,116,134,142,160,164,168,194,224\n\nWait, I have some repeats, need to check for duplicates.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- 44 appears from (2,14) and (4,8)\n\n- 98 from (8,10)\n\n- 164 from (10,12)\n\n- 168 from (12,12)\n\n- 224 from (14,14)\n\nSo, unique values are:\n\n8,14,20,24,26,32,34,38,44,48,54,62,64,74,76,80,90,98,116,134,142,160,164,168,194,224\n\nNow, counting these, let's list them in order:\n\n8,14,20,24,26,32,34,38,44,48,54,62,64,74,76,80,90,98,116,134,142,160,164,168,194,224\n\nThat's 26 distinct values.\n\nBut wait, the answer choices are:\n\nA. 21\n\nB. 27\n\nC. 49\n\nD. 45\n\n26 is not among them, so I must have missed something.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in calculating or counting.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nFirst, list all pairs and their corresponding values:\n\n(2,2): 8\n\n(2,4):14\n\n(2,6):20\n\n(2,8):26\n\n(2,10):32\n\n(2,12):38\n\n(2,14):44\n\n(4,4):24\n\n(4,6):34\n\n(4,8):44\n\n(4,10):54\n\n(4,12):64\n\n(4,14):74\n\n(6,6):48\n\n(6,8):62\n\n(6,10):76\n\n(6,12):90\n\n(6,14):104\n\n(8,8):80\n\n(8,10):98\n\n(8,12):116\n\n(8,14):134\n\n(10,10):120\n\n(10,12):142\n\n(10,14):164\n\n(12,12):168\n\n(12,14):194\n\n(14,14):224\n\nNow, listing unique values:\n\n8,14,20,24,26,32,34,38,44,48,54,62,64,74,76,80,90,98,116,134,142,160,164,168,194,224\n\nWait, 160 is not in the list above, but let's check if it appears.\n\nLooking back, (10,12) is 142, (12,14) is 194, and (12,12) is 168, but 160 doesn't appear.\n\nIs there a pair that gives 160?\n\nLet's see, maybe I missed a pair.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a pair that gives 160.\n\nLooking back, (10,12) is 142, (12,14) is 194, and (12,12) is 168.\n\nSo, 160 doesn't appear.\n\nBut perhaps there's a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I need to double-check some calculations.\n\nTake (6,12): (6+1)(12+1) -1 = 7*13 -1 = 91 -1 = 90\n\n(8,10): (8+1)(10+1) -1 = 9*11 -1 = 99 -1 = 98\n\n(10,8): same as (8,10), which is 98\n\n(10,12): (10+1)(12+1) -1 = 11*13 -1 = 143 -1 = 142\n\n(12,10): same as (10,12), 142\n\n(12,14): (12+1)(14+1) -1 = 13*15 -1 = 195 -1 = 194\n\n(14,12): same as (12,14), 194\n\n(14,14): (14+1)(14+1) -1 = 15*15 -1 = 225 -1 = 224\n\nSo, no 160 appears.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier.\n\nLooking back, (12,12) is 168, which is correctly listed.\n\nSo, the unique values are:\n\n8,14,20,24,26,32,34,38,44,48,54,62,64,74,76,80,90,98,116,134,142,168,194,224\n\nThat's 24 values.\n\nBut the answer choices are 21, 27, 49, 45.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some duplicates.\n\nLet me check again:\n\n- 44 appears from (2,14) and (4,8)\n\n- 98 from (8,10)\n\n- 142 from (10,12)\n\n- 194 from (12,14)\n\n- 224 from (14,14)\n\nNo duplicates beyond that.\n\nSo, 24 unique values, but that's not an option.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me list them again:\n\n8,14,20,24,26,32,34,38,44,48,54,62,64,74,76,80,90,98,116,134,142,168,194,224\n\nThat's 24 values.\n\nBut since 24 isn't an option, perhaps there are more.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some values.\n\nLet me see if there are any other possible values.\n\nLooking back, perhaps there are more pairs that give the same value.\n\nWait, for example, (4,6) gives 34, and (6,4) also gives 34, but since we're considering unordered pairs, it's already accounted for.\n\nSimilarly, (2,12) gives 38, and (12,2) gives the same.\n\nWait, but in my earlier list, I only have (2,12) as 38, and (12,2) is the same.\n\nSimilarly, (4,8) and (8,4) both give 44.\n\nSo, no new values there.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that some values might coincide with others.\n\nBut from the calculations, it seems that each pair gives a distinct value except for the duplicates I already accounted for.\n\nSo, 24 unique values, but that's not an option.\n\nMaybe I need to check if there are overlapping values.\n\nLet me check if any of these values are equal.\n\nFor example, does 14 appear from more than one pair?\n\n(2,4) gives 14, and is that equal to any other pair? Looking at (4,2), which is the same as (2,4), so no new value.\n\nSimilarly, 20 from (2,6), unique.\n\n24 from (4,4), unique.\n\n26 from (2,8), unique.\n\n32 from (2,10), unique.\n\n34 from (4,6), unique.\n\n38 from (2,12), unique.\n\n44 from (2,14) and (4,8), already accounted for.\n\n48 from (6,6), unique.\n\n54 from (4,10), unique.\n\n62 from (6,8), unique.\n\n64 from (4,12), unique.\n\n74 from (4,14), unique.\n\n76 from (6,10), unique.\n\n80 from (8,8), unique.\n\n90 from (6,12), unique.\n\n98 from (8,10), unique.\n\n116 from (8,12), unique.\n\n134 from (8,14), unique.\n\n142 from (10,12), unique.\n\n164 from (10,14), unique.\n\n168 from (12,12), unique.\n\n1"
