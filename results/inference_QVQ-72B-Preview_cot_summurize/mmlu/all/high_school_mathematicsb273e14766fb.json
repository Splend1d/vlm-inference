                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here: I need to find the probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 of the 5 rolls of a fair 6-sided die. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when you roll a fair 6-sided die, each face has an equal chance of landing face up, so the probability of getting a 6 on any single roll is 1/6. Similarly, the probability of not getting a 6 is 5/6.\n\nSince I'm rolling the die 5 times, this sounds like a binomial probability problem. In binomial probability, we have a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes: success or failure. Here, \"success\" could be defined as rolling a 6, and \"failure\" as rolling anything else.\n\nThe formula for the binomial probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials is:\n\n\\[ P(k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) is the number of combinations of n things taken k at a time.\n\n- \\( p \\) is the probability of success on a single trial.\n\n- \\( 1-p \\) is the probability of failure on a single trial.\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- n = 5 (since we're rolling the die 5 times)\n\n- p = 1/6 (probability of rolling a 6)\n\n- k can be 0, 1, or 2 (since we want at most 2 sixes)\n\nSo, to find the probability of getting at most 2 sixes, I need to calculate the sum of the probabilities for k = 0, k = 1, and k = 2.\n\nLet's write that down:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{at most 2 sixes}) = P(0) + P(1) + P(2) \\]\n\nNow, let's compute each term one by one.\n\nFirst, \\( P(0) \\), which is the probability of getting no sixes in 5 rolls.\n\n\\[ P(0) = \\binom{5}{0} \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^0 \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^5 \\]\n\n\\[ P(0) = 1 \\times 1 \\times \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^5 \\]\n\n\\[ P(0) = \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^5 \\]\n\nNext, \\( P(1) \\), the probability of getting exactly one 6 in 5 rolls.\n\n\\[ P(1) = \\binom{5}{1} \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^1 \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^4 \\]\n\n\\[ P(1) = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^4 \\]\n\n\\[ P(1) = \\frac{5}{6} \\times \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^4 \\]\n\n\\[ P(1) = 5 \\times \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^5 \\]\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't look right. Let's double-check that.\n\nActually, \\( \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^4 \\) is the probability of getting no sixes in 4 rolls, and then multiplied by 1/6 for the one six. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nMoving on to \\( P(2) \\), the probability of getting exactly two 6's in 5 rolls.\n\n\\[ P(2) = \\binom{5}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^3 \\]\n\n\\[ P(2) = 10 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^2 \\times \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^3 \\]\n\n\\[ P(2) = 10 \\times \\frac{1}{36} \\times \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^3 \\]\n\n\\[ P(2) = \\frac{10}{36} \\times \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^3 \\]\n\nNow, to find the total probability, I need to add up \\( P(0) \\), \\( P(1) \\), and \\( P(2) \\).\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{at most 2 sixes}) = \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^5 + 5 \\times \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^5 + 10 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^2 \\times \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^3 \\]\n\nHmm, it would be easier if I could factor out some terms to simplify the calculation.\n\nNotice that \\( \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^5 \\) appears in both \\( P(0) \\) and \\( P(1) \\), so let's factor that out.\n\n\\[ P(\\text{at most 2 sixes}) = \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^5 \\times (1 + 5) + 10 \\times \\frac{1}{36} \\times \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^3 \\]\n\n\\[ P(\\text{at most 2 sixes}) = \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^5 \\times 6 + \\frac{10}{36} \\times \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^3 \\]\n\nNow, let's compute each part separately.\n\nFirst, calculate \\( \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^5 \\times 6 \\):\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^5 = \\frac{3125}{7776} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{3125}{7776} \\times 6 = \\frac{3125 \\times 6}{7776} = \\frac{18750}{7776} \\]\n\nWait, that seems off because 18750 divided by 7776 is greater than 1, but probabilities can't be greater than 1. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nLet me check again.\n\nActually, \\( \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^5 = \\frac{3125}{7776} \\), and multiplying by 6:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3125}{7776} \\times 6 = \\frac{3125 \\times 6}{7776} = \\frac{18750}{7776} \\]\n\nHmm, that can't be right because it's greater than 1. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the probability of getting exactly 0, 1, or 2 sixes separately and then sum them up, keeping everything in fraction form to avoid decimals.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, \\( P(0) = \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^5 = \\frac{3125}{7776} \\)\n\nNext, \\( P(1) = 5 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^4 = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{625}{1296} = \\frac{3125}{7776} \\)\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would make \\( P(1) = \\frac{3125}{7776} \\), which is the same as \\( P(0) \\), but that doesn't make sense because the probabilities should decrease as k increases.\n\nWait a second, no. Let's recalculate \\( P(1) \\):\n\n\\[ P(1) = \\binom{5}{1} \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^1 \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^4 \\]\n\n\\[ P(1) = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^4 \\]\n\n\\[ P(1) = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{625}{1296} \\]\n\n\\[ P(1) = 5 \\times \\frac{625}{7776} \\]\n\n\\[ P(1) = \\frac{3125}{7776} \\]\n\nWait, that's the same as \\( P(0) \\), which can't be correct. There must be a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nActually, no. \\( \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^4 \\) is \\( \\frac{625}{1296} \\), and multiplying by \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) gives \\( \\frac{625}{7776} \\), then multiplied by 5 is \\( \\frac{3125}{7776} \\). So, \\( P(1) = \\frac{3125}{7776} \\), same as \\( P(0) \\).\n\nBut intuitively, \\( P(1) \\) should be less than \\( P(0) \\), because as the number of sixes increases, the probability should decrease. So, there's definitely a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the binomial formula. Let me double-check the formula.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is indeed:\n\n\\[ P(k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \\]\n\nIn this case:\n\n- n = 5\n\n- k = 1\n\n- p = 1/6\n\n- q = 1 - p = 5/6\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ P(1) = \\binom{5}{1} \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^1 \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^4 \\]\n\n\\[ P(1) = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^4 \\]\n\n\\[ P(1) = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{625}{1296} \\]\n\n\\[ P(1) = 5 \\times \\frac{625}{7776} \\]\n\n\\[ P(1) = \\frac{3125}{7776} \\]\n\nBut this seems counterintuitive because I would expect \\( P(1) \\) to be less than \\( P(0) \\). Maybe I need to calculate \\( P(0) \\) again.\n\n\\[ P(0) = \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^5 = \\frac{3125}{7776} \\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So, \\( P(0) = \\frac{3125}{7776} \\) and \\( P(1) = \\frac{3125}{7776} \\). That means that the probability of getting exactly one six is the same as getting no sixes at all. That's interesting.\n\nNow, let's calculate \\( P(2) \\):\n\n\\[ P(2) = \\binom{5}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^3 \\]\n\n\\[ P(2) = 10 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^2 \\times \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^3 \\]\n\n\\[ P(2) = 10 \\times \\frac{1}{36} \\times \\frac{125}{216} \\]\n\n\\[ P(2) = 10 \\times \\frac{125}{7776} \\]\n\n\\[ P(2) = \\frac{1250}{7776} \\]\n\nSimplifying that fraction:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1250 \\div 2}{7776 \\div 2} = \\frac{625}{3888} \\]\n\nSo, \\( P(2) = \\frac{625}{3888} \\)\n\nNow, to find the total probability of getting at most 2 sixes, we add up \\( P(0) \\), \\( P(1) \\), and \\( P(2) \\):\n\n\\[ P(\\text{at most 2 sixes}) = P(0) + P(1) + P(2) = \\frac{3125}{7776} + \\frac{3125}{7776} + \\frac{625}{3888} \\]\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 7776 and 3888. What's the least common multiple (LCM) of 7776 and 3888?\n\nWell, 7776 is 2^4 * 3^6, and 3888 is 2^3 * 3^5, so the LCM would be 2^4 * 3^6 = 7776.\n\nSo, the common denominator is 7776.\n\nNow, convert each fraction:\n\n\\[ P(0) = \\frac{3125}{7776} \\]\n\n\\[ P(1) = \\frac{3125}{7776} \\]\n\nFor \\( P(2) \\), which is \\( \\frac{625}{3888} \\), we need to convert it to have a denominator of 7776.\n\nSince 3888 * 2 = 7776, then:\n\n\\[ P(2) = \\frac{625 \\times 2}{3888 \\times 2} = \\frac{1250}{7776} \\]\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{at most 2 sixes}) = \\frac{3125}{7776} + \\frac{3125}{7776} + \\frac{1250}{7776} = \\frac{3125 + 3125 + 1250}{7776} = \\frac{7500}{7776} \\]\n\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 12.\n\nFirst, divide numerator and denominator by 12:\n\n7500 \u00f7 12 = 625\n\n7776 \u00f7 12 = 648\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ P(\\text{at most 2 sixes}) = \\frac{625}{648} \\]\n\nWait a minute, that can't be right because probabilities can't be greater than 1. But 625/648 is approximately 0.964, which is less than 1. So, that's fine.\n\nBut looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. \\frac{125}{648}\n\nB. \\frac{25}{648}\n\nC. \\frac{625}{648}\n\nD. \\frac{1}{648}\n\nOption C is \\frac{625}{648}, which matches my calculation. However, I need to make sure that my approach is correct and that there are no mistakes in the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to approach this problem, such as using the complement rule. The complement of getting at most 2 sixes is getting 3, 4, or 5 sixes. So, perhaps calculating the probability of getting 3, 4, or 5 sixes and subtracting that from 1 would be easier.\n\nLet's try that method.\n\nFirst, calculate the probability of getting exactly 3 sixes:\n\n\\[ P(3) = \\binom{5}{3} \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ P(3) = 10 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^3 \\times \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ P(3) = 10 \\times \\frac{1}{216} \\times \\frac{25}{36} \\]\n\n\\[ P(3) = 10 \\times \\frac{25}{7776} \\]\n\n\\[ P(3) = \\frac{250}{7776} \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ \\frac{250 \\div 2}{7776 \\div 2} = \\frac{125}{3888} \\]\n\nSimilarly, for exactly 4 sixes:\n\n\\[ P(4) = \\binom{5}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^4 \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^1 \\]\n\n\\[ P(4) = 5 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^4 \\times \\frac{5}{6} \\]\n\n\\[ P(4) = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{1296} \\times \\frac{5}{6} \\]\n\n\\[ P(4) = 5 \\times \\frac{5}{7776} \\]\n\n\\[ P(4) = \\frac{25}{7776} \\]\n\nAnd for exactly 5 sixes:\n\n\\[ P(5) = \\binom{5}{5} \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^5 \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^0 \\]\n\n\\[ P(5) = 1 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^5 \\times 1 \\]\n\n\\[ P(5) = \\frac{1}{7776} \\]\n\nNow, sum these probabilities:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{at least 3 sixes}) = P(3) + P(4) + P(5) = \\frac{125}{3888"
