                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about Aquinas's view on prudence. The options are:\n\nA. pleasure.\n\nB. desire.\n\nC. moral virtue.\n\nD. piety.\n\nAnd the question is asking what acts of prudence are solely about in Aquinas's view. I need to pick one of these options.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what prudence is according to Aquinas. I remember that Aquinas was a medieval philosopher and theologian who wrote a lot about ethics and virtue. Prudence is a virtue, right? But specifically, what does prudence entail?\n\nLet me think about it. Prudence is often defined as practical wisdom or the ability to make good decisions and judgments. It's considered a cardinal virtue, and Aquinas likely placed a lot of emphasis on it.\n\nNow, the question is asking what acts of prudence are solely about. So, among these options\u2014pleasure, desire, moral virtue, and piety\u2014which one would prudence be directly concerned with?\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Pleasure: Aquinas believed in a balanced approach to life, but he also emphasized that excessive pursuit of pleasure could lead to vice. So, while pleasure might be a part of human experience, I don't think prudence is solely about pleasure. Maybe it's about using pleasure appropriately, but not entirely centered on it.\n\nB. Desire: Similar to pleasure, desires are a part of human nature. Aquinas would probably say that desires need to be ordered correctly, according to reason and moral law. But again, prudence seems to be more about making right choices, not just about\u6b32\u671b themselves.\n\nC. Moral virtue: This seems promising. Prudence is often seen as a virtue that helps us live a moral life by making wise choices. Aquinas likely viewed prudence as essential for cultivating other virtues because it involves knowing how to act well in different situations. So, maybe acts of prudence are solely about matters of moral virtue.\n\nD. Piety: Piety relates to religious duty and reverence towards God. While Aquinas was deeply religious and his philosophy is grounded in Christian theology, prudence seems to be a more general virtue that applies to both religious and secular aspects of life. So, prudence isn't solely about piety, but it might include piety as part of a larger framework.\n\nHmm, comparing options C and D, moral virtue seems more comprehensive. Prudence helps us act morally in general, not just in religious contexts. Piety is one aspect of morality, but prudence would apply to many other areas as well.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to look deeper into Aquinas's writings to get a better understanding. I recall that in his \"Summa Theologica,\" Aquinas discusses the virtues in detail. Let me try to recall what he said about prudence.\n\nPrudence is defined by Aquinas as the virtue that ordinates action to a rectitude of intention. That is, it helps us order our actions towards doing what is right and good. It involves both the intellectual and the moral faculties.\n\nSo, if prudence is about ordering our actions towards rectitude, it seems closely tied to moral virtue in general, not just specific aspects like pleasure, desire, or piety.\n\nBut maybe there's a specific context in which prudence relates more directly to one of these options. For instance, some scholars might argue that prudence is about moderating desires or pleasures, but I still think that's part of moral virtue as a whole.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in Aquinas's view, prudence is particularly connected to piety because of his emphasis on the ultimate end of human life being union with God. But again, prudence seems to have a broader scope, encompassing all moral actions, not just those related to piety.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose someone is facing a moral dilemma, say, whether to tell the truth or lie to protect someone's feelings. Prudence would involve considering the circumstances and choosing the action that aligns with moral virtue. This could involve elements of piety, desire, or pleasure, but ultimately, it's about making a morally virtuous choice.\n\nSo, in this case, prudence is about applying moral virtue to the situation at hand.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the role of prudence in Aquinas's virtue ethics. He saw prudence as a cardinal virtue, meaning it's one of the main virtues that inform and guide the others. Therefore, it's fundamental to moral virtue.\n\nGiven that, it's unlikely that prudence is solely about pleasure, desire, or piety, as those are more specific aspects of human life.\n\nPerhaps the key word here is \"solely.\" Even if prudence relates to pleasure, desire, or piety, its primary concern is with moral virtue.\n\nWait, but the question says \"solely about matters of...\" So, it's asking for the singular focus of prudence in Aquinas's view.\n\nGiven that, and considering Aquinas's emphasis on prudence as the virtue that guides all other virtues, I think the answer is C. moral virtue.\n\nBut to make sure, let me check some secondary sources or summaries of Aquinas's views on prudence.\n\nOh, but since this is a thought exercise, I need to rely on my own understanding.\n\nAlright, based on what I know, I'll go with option C. moral virtue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
