                    "text": "So I've got this equation here: 3 over 4 times x equals 24. I need to solve for x. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"3 over 4\" means. It's the same as 3 divided by 4, right? So, 3/4 * x = 24.\n\nI think the best way to solve for x is to isolate x on one side of the equation. To do that, I need to get rid of the 3/4 that's multiplying x. The opposite of multiplication is division, so I should divide both sides of the equation by 3/4.\n\nWait, but dividing by a fraction can be a bit tricky. I remember that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So, the reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/3. Therefore, I can multiply both sides by 4/3 instead of dividing by 3/4.\n\nLet me try that:\n\n(4/3) * (3/4) * x = 24 * (4/3)\n\nOn the left side, (3/4) multiplied by (4/3) equals 1, so I'm left with x.\n\nSo, x = 24 * (4/3)\n\nNow, I need to multiply 24 by 4/3. I can think of 24 as 24/1, so:\n\n24 * (4/3) = (24/1) * (4/3) = (24 * 4) / (1 * 3) = 96 / 3 = 32\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, x equals 32.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with 3/4 * x = 24\n\nMultiply both sides by 4/3:\n\nx = 24 * 4/3\n\nSimplify:\n\nx = (24 * 4) / 3\n\nWhich is 96 / 3\n\nAnd that's 32.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of cross-multiplication. If 3/4 * x = 24, then cross-multiplying would give me 3x = 24 * 4\n\nSo, 3x = 96\n\nThen, dividing both sides by 3:\n\nx = 96 / 3 = 32\n\nYeah, that matches what I got before.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to first multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n4 * (3/4 * x) = 24 * 4\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n3x = 96\n\nThen, divide both sides by 3:\n\nx = 96 / 3 = 32\n\nAgain, x equals 32.\n\nI think I've confirmed it in a few different ways, so I'm pretty confident with this answer.\n\nWait a minute, let's consider if there's another approach. Maybe using decimals instead of fractions.\n\nI know that 3/4 is the same as 0.75. So, 0.75 times x equals 24.\n\nTo solve for x, I can divide both sides by 0.75:\n\nx = 24 / 0.75\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n24 divided by 0.75.\n\nWell, 0.75 times 32 is 24, because 0.75 * 30 = 22.5, and 0.75 * 2 = 1.5, so 22.5 + 1.5 = 24.\n\nYes, so x equals 32.\n\nThis matches what I got earlier, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert 0.75 back to a fraction to confirm.\n\n0.75 is 3/4, which is what I started with.\n\nSo, all methods lead me to x = 32.\n\nI should also check if this makes sense in the original equation.\n\nSo, plug x = 32 into the original equation:\n\n3/4 * 32 = 24\n\nLet's calculate 3/4 of 32.\n\nFirst, 1/4 of 32 is 8, because 32 divided by 4 is 8.\n\nThen, 3/4 is 3 times that, so 3 * 8 = 24.\n\nPerfect, it checks out.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to see if 3/4 * 32 really equals 24.\n\nI can also think about it in terms of simplifying the fraction first.\n\nWait, 3/4 * x = 24\n\nI could also write this as x = 24 / (3/4)\n\nDividing by a fraction is multiplying by its reciprocal, so x = 24 * (4/3) = 32\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nI think I've exhausted all the possible ways to approach this problem, and each time I arrive at x = 32.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 32\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 32} \\]"
