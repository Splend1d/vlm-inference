Two English proficiency tests administered to the student show that she performs above the mean for monolingual English grade peers in speaking and listening but well below the mean in reading and writing. She also performs well above the mean for grade peers on reading tests in her native language. Based on this information alone, which of the following is the most accurate interpretation?\n\nA.

She was really good at reading in her own language, but now she's having trouble with reading in English, especially with the basal reader they use in second grade. Her teacher noticed this and had her tested for English proficiency. The tests show that she's really good at speaking and listening in English, better than the average kid her age who only speaks English. But when it comes to reading and writing in English, she's not doing as well; she's below average compared to those same kids. However, if you test her reading in her native language, she does really well, better than the average kid her age.\n\nSo, based on this information, which of these options is the most accurate interpretation?\n\nOption A says that continuing to use her native language at home is interfering with her ability to learn English.\n\nOption B says that her difficulty in reading now is a sign that she'll have more academic problems in the future because schoolwork will require more reading.\n\nOption C says that the difference between her social English skills and her reading skills is normal because social skills are learned in a richer context.\n\nOption D says that the difference between her reading skills in her native language and in English is due to English being more complex.\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that she's fluent in social English, which means she can talk and understand people in everyday conversations. But when it comes to reading and writing, which are more academic skills, she's struggling. This suggests that maybe there's a difference between conversational language and academic language.\n\nI've heard that in bilingual education, there's a concept called \"language dominance,\" where one language might be stronger than the other, especially in certain skills like reading and writing. But in this case, she's strong in speaking and listening in English but weak in reading and writing, while being strong in reading in her native language.\n\nOption A suggests that using her native language at home is interfering with her English development. But that seems a bit simplistic. I think it's possible to maintain proficiency in both languages without one interfering with the other, especially since she's doing well in speaking and listening in English. Maybe the issue is more about the way reading and writing are being taught in English, or perhaps she needs more time to develop those skills in English.\n\nOption B says that her current reading difficulty is an early indicator of future academic problems because schoolwork will require more reading. While it's true that as students progress through school, they need stronger reading skills, I'm not sure if this is the most accurate interpretation based on the information given. She's only in second grade, and a lot can change in a few years. Plus, she's already shown that she can learn English quickly in social contexts, so maybe with the right support, she can improve her reading in English too.\n\nOption C says that the discrepancy between her social English skills and her reading skills is expected because social skills are acquired in a richer context. This makes sense to me. I've read that learning a language for social purposes, like talking with friends and family, is different from learning it for academic purposes, like reading textbooks and writing essays. Social language is often learned more quickly because it's used in natural, interactive settings, whereas academic language might require more formal instruction and practice. So, it's common for English language learners to be proficient in social English but still developing in academic English.\n\nOption D suggests that the difference between her reading skills in her native language and English is due to English being more complex. Well, I'm not sure about that. English can be complex, but so can many other languages. It might not be fair to assume that English is inherently more complex than her native language. Maybe the teaching methods or the curriculum in English reading are different from what she's used to in her native language, but that's different from saying English is more complex.\n\nConsidering all this, I think Option C is the most accurate interpretation. The discrepancy between her social English skills and her reading skills is expected given the richer context in which social skills are acquired. It's a normal part of the language learning process, especially in an academic setting.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it again. She's doing well in speaking and listening in English, which are social skills, but not as well in reading and writing, which are more academic skills. This suggests that her proficiency in academic English needs more development, which is typical for English language learners. It doesn't necessarily mean that using her native language at home is interfering, or that English is more complex, or that she's destined to have ongoing academic problems.\n\nSo, I would go with Option C as the most accurate interpretation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
