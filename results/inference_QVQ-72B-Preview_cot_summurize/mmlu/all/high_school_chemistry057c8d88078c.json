                    "text": "So I have this question about identifying molecules that exhibit sp\u00b2 hybridization around their central atoms. The options are CO\u2082, CO\u2083\u00b2\u207b, NO\u2082\u207b, and NO\u2083\u207b. I need to pick which ones have sp\u00b2 hybridization. The choices are combinations of these molecules, so I have to be careful.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what sp\u00b2 hybridization means. Sp\u00b2 hybridization occurs when an atom has three hybrid orbitals formed by combining one s orbital and two p orbitals. This typically happens in molecules where the central atom is bonded to three other atoms or has a double bond.\n\nTo determine the hybridization of the central atom in each molecule, I should look at the steric number, which is the number of sigma bonds plus the number of lone pairs on the central atom. The steric number will tell me the hybridization:\n\n- Steric number 2 corresponds to sp hybridization.\n\n- Steric number 3 corresponds to sp\u00b2 hybridization.\n\n- Steric number 4 corresponds to sp\u00b3 hybridization.\n\n- And so on.\n\nSo, for each molecule, I'll need to:\n\n1. Determine the central atom.\n\n2. Find out how many sigma bonds it forms.\n\n3. Count the number of lone pairs on the central atom.\n\n4. Calculate the steric number (sigma bonds + lone pairs).\n\n5. Determine the hybridization based on the steric number.\n\nLet's start with CO\u2082.\n\nCO\u2082: Carbon Dioxide\n\n- Central atom: Carbon (C).\n\n- It is double-bonded to two Oxygen atoms: O=C=O.\n\n- Each double bond consists of one sigma bond and one pi bond.\n\n- So, it has two sigma bonds (one to each O) and two pi bonds.\n\n- Lone pairs: Carbon has four valence electrons, and it uses four to form the two double bonds. So, no lone pairs.\n\n- Steric number = 2 (sigma bonds) + 0 (lone pairs) = 2.\n\n- This corresponds to sp hybridization.\n\nSo, CO\u2082 is not sp\u00b2 hybridized.\n\nNext, CO\u2083\u00b2\u207b: Carbonate Ion\n\n- Central atom: Carbon (C).\n\n- It is bonded to three Oxygen atoms, with one double bond and two single bonds: O=C-O\u207b\u207b.\n\n- So, it has three sigma bonds (one to each O) and one pi bond.\n\n- Lone pairs: Carbon has four valence electrons. In the carbonate ion, it forms four bonds (three single and one double), using all four valence electrons plus the two from the double bond. So, no lone pairs.\n\n- Steric number = 3 (sigma bonds) + 0 (lone pairs) = 3.\n\n- This corresponds to sp\u00b2 hybridization.\n\nSo, CO\u2083\u00b2\u207b is sp\u00b2 hybridized.\n\nNow, NO\u2082\u207b: Nitrite Ion\n\n- Central atom: Nitrogen (N).\n\n- It is bonded to two Oxygen atoms, with one double bond and one single bond: O=N-O\u207b.\n\n- So, it has two sigma bonds (one to each O) and one pi bond.\n\n- Lone pairs: Nitrogen has five valence electrons. It forms three bonds (two to O, one double and one single), using five valence electrons. So, no lone pairs.\n\n- Steric number = 2 (sigma bonds) + 0 (lone pairs) = 2.\n\n- This corresponds to sp hybridization.\n\nSo, NO\u2082\u207b is not sp\u00b2 hybridized.\n\nLastly, NO\u2083\u207b: Nitrate Ion\n\n- Central atom: Nitrogen (N).\n\n- It is bonded to three Oxygen atoms, with one double bond and two single bonds: O=N-O\u207b-O\u207b.\n\n- So, it has three sigma bonds (one to each O) and one pi bond.\n\n- Lone pairs: Nitrogen has five valence electrons. It forms three bonds (one double and two single), using five valence electrons plus one from the double bond. So, no lone pairs.\n\n- Steric number = 3 (sigma bonds) + 0 (lone pairs) = 3.\n\n- This corresponds to sp\u00b2 hybridization.\n\nSo, NO\u2083\u207b is sp\u00b2 hybridized.\n\nTherefore, the molecules that exhibit sp\u00b2 hybridization around their central atoms are CO\u2083\u00b2\u207b and NO\u2083\u207b.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. CO\u2082 and CO\u2083\u00b2\u207b\n\n- CO\u2082 is sp hybridized, CO\u2083\u00b2\u207b is sp\u00b2 hybridized.\n\nB. NO\u2082\u207b and NO\u2083\u207b\n\n- NO\u2082\u207b is sp hybridized, NO\u2083\u207b is sp\u00b2 hybridized.\n\nC. CO\u2083\u00b2\u207b and NO\u2083\u207b\n\n- Both are sp\u00b2 hybridized.\n\nD. CO\u2083\u00b2\u207b, NO\u2082\u207b and NO\u2083\u207b\n\n- CO\u2083\u00b2\u207b and NO\u2083\u207b are sp\u00b2 hybridized, but NO\u2082\u207b is sp hybridized.\n\nSo, the correct choice is C. CO\u2083\u00b2\u207b and NO\u2083\u207b.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, in CO\u2083\u00b2\u207b, the central carbon is bonded to three oxygens with no lone pairs, which indeed gives a steric number of 3, confirming sp\u00b2 hybridization.\n\nIn NO\u2083\u207b, the central nitrogen is bonded to three oxygens with no lone pairs, also giving a steric number of 3, confirming sp\u00b2 hybridization.\n\nIn CO\u2082, the central carbon is bonded to two oxygens with no lone pairs, giving a steric number of 2, which is sp hybridization.\n\nIn NO\u2082\u207b, the central nitrogen is bonded to two oxygens with no lone pairs, giving a steric number of 2, which is sp hybridization.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. CO\u2083\u00b2\u207b and NO\u2083\u207b.\n\nWait a minute, in some textbooks, the nitrite ion (NO\u2082\u207b) is described with resonance structures where the negative charge is delocalized over the two oxygen atoms, and the nitrogen has a partial positive charge. Does this affect the hybridization?\n\nLet me think about that. In the resonance hybrid of NO\u2082\u207b, the nitrogen is bonded to both oxygens with bonds that are somewhere between a single and a double bond due to resonance. However, the steric number is still based on the number of sigma bonds and lone pairs.\n\nIn this case, nitrogen still has two sigma bonds (one to each oxygen) and no lone pairs, so the steric number is 2, which is sp hybridization. So, my initial assessment stands.\n\nSimilarly, in CO\u2083\u00b2\u207b, the double bond is delocalized over the three oxygen atoms, but the steric number for carbon is still 3, corresponding to sp\u00b2 hybridization.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is C. CO\u2083\u00b2\u207b and NO\u2083\u207b.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
