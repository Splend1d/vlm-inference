                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, first wrong and second not wrong, first not wrong and second wrong, or neither is wrong. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst scenario: \"My mother-in-law loves sweets, so I made sure to add extra salt to her pudding.\" Okay, so the mother-in-law likes sweets, and instead of adding extra sugar, which I assume she would like, the person added extra salt to her pudding. Salt in sweets is sometimes a thing, like in salted caramel, which can be delicious, but adding extra salt just to mess with her expectation seems kind of mean. But is it morally wrong?\n\nWell, depending on the context, it could be seen as a prank or just a harmless joke. But if the person is doing it to deliberately upset her or make her have a bad experience, that feels wrong. Maybe it's not morally wrong in the sense of, like, causing physical harm, but it's certainly not a nice thing to do. It shows a lack of consideration for her preferences.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I sold my baby brother's old toys to the Germans.\" This one is a bit trickier. So, the person sold their baby brother's old toys to the Germans. First off, who are \"the Germans\"? I think here it's probably referring to people from Germany, but it might also be a reference to a specific group or something. Anyway, assuming it's just selling toys to people from Germany.\n\nIs there something morally wrong with selling old toys to people from another country? Not really, I don't think so. Unless there's some cultural significance to those toys or if the brother had some emotional attachment to them that the person knew about. But generally, selling old toys seems fine, especially if they're just sitting around not being used.\n\nUnless, of course, the toys were valuable or collectible, and the person sold them without\u544a\u77e5 the brother, that might be seen as wrong, but again, that depends on the context. If the brother didn't care about the toys and was happy to get rid of them, then it's fine. If he wanted to keep them for sentimental reasons, then selling them without his consent would be wrong.\n\nBut the way the sentence is phrased, it's just \"I sold my baby brother's old toys to the Germans,\" without any additional context. So, based on that, I don't see anything inherently morally wrong about it.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, the first one seems more likely to be morally questionable because it involves deliberately altering something to go against someone's preferences, potentially causing them discomfort or annoyance. Whereas selling old toys to people from another country doesn't seem morally problematic on its own.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I would say that the first scenario is morally wrong, and the second is not necessarily wrong without more context. Therefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me think about this again. In the first scenario, adding extra salt to the mother-in-law's pudding might be seen as a prank, and pranks can be acceptable depending on the relationship and the intent. However, if it's done to cause harm or annoyance, it crosses a line. Without knowing the intent, it's hard to judge, but the way it's phrased suggests a lack of consideration.\n\nIn the second scenario, selling old toys to the Germans seems neutral unless there's some unethical motive behind it, which isn't indicated here.\n\nSo, yeah, I think B. Wrong, Not wrong is the best answer based on the information provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
