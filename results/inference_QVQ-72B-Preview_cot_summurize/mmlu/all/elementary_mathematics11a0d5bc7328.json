                    "text": "So I have this division problem: 5.04 divided by 0.7. I need to find the quotient, and there are four options to choose from. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that dividing by a decimal can be tricky, but there's a way to make it easier. I can move the decimal points in both the dividend and the divisor to turn the divisor into a whole number. That should make the division simpler.\n\nSo, the divisor is 0.7, which is the same as 7 tenths. To make it a whole number, I need to move the decimal point one place to the right, turning 0.7 into 7. But I have to do the same to the dividend as well. So, 5.04 moved one place to the right becomes 50.4.\n\nNow, the problem is 50.4 divided by 7.\n\nLet me try to do this division step by step.\n\nFirst, I look at 50 divided by 7. 7 times 7 is 49, which is less than 50, and 7 times 8 is 56, which is more than 50. So, 7 goes into 50 seven times. I write down 7 and subtract 49 from 50 to get 1. Then, I bring down the next digit, which is 4, making it 14.\n\nNow, 7 goes into 14 exactly two times. I write down 2 and subtract 14 from 14, getting 0. Since there are no more digits to bring down, I know that the division is exact, and there are no remainders.\n\nSo, the quotient is 7.2.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.72\n\nB. 0.702\n\nC. 10.0571\n\nD. 7.2\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. 7.2.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can use another method to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about dividing by 0.7 is to multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10 to eliminate the decimal.\n\nSo, 5.04 divided by 0.7 is the same as 5.04 times 10 divided by 0.7 times 10, which is 50.4 divided by 7, which is what I did before.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about dividing 5.04 by 0.7 directly, but that might be more complicated.\n\nWait, another way is to use the reciprocal. Since dividing by 0.7 is the same as multiplying by 10/7, but that might not help directly here.\n\nI think the first method is the most straightforward. Moving the decimals to make the divisor a whole number is probably the easiest way to handle this division.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is D. 7.2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
