                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question: \"Which of the following candies is traditionally fruit flavored?\" And the options are A. M&M's, B. Skittles, C. Reese's Pieces, and D. Junior Mints. Hmm, I need to think about each one.\n\nFirst, M&M's. I know M&M's are chocolate candies with those colorful coatings. They're mostly known for their milk chocolate and peanut varieties, but they do have some fruit flavors too, like strawberries and cream or caramel apple. But traditionally, when people think of M&M's, they think of chocolate, right? So, maybe not primarily fruit-flavored.\n\nNext, Skittles. Oh, Skittles are those chewy candy sweets that come in a rainbow of colors and flavors. The original mix has flavors like apple, strawberry, orange, lemon, and grape. So, these are definitely fruit-flavored candies. In fact, that's what they're known for\u2014their vibrant colors and corresponding fruit tastes. So, this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nThen, Reese's Pieces. I know Reese's is famous for their peanut butter cups, but Reese's Pieces are those small, bite-sized candies that are also peanut butter flavored, usually covered in a colorful sugar coating. So, again, while they might have some fruit flavors in specific varieties, generally, they're known for their peanut butter taste. So, probably not traditionally fruit-flavored.\n\nLastly, Junior Mints. These are those round, mint-flavored candies that come in a small, green, metal-like container. They're known for their cool, minty taste, which isn't exactly fruit-flavored. Maybe some people consider mint a herb, but it's not a fruit. So, definitely not fruit-flavored.\n\nSo, comparing all four, Skittles are clearly known for their fruit flavors, whereas the others are more associated with chocolate, peanut butter, or mint. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. Skittles.\n\nWait a minute, just to make sure, let me double-check. M&M's\u2014primarily chocolate with some fruit flavors in certain varieties. Skittles\u2014consistently fruit-flavored across their main product line. Reese's Pieces\u2014primarily peanut butter-flavored. Junior Mints\u2014mint-flavored. Yeah, Skittles seems to be the best fit for traditionally fruit-flavored candy.\n\nI don't think the question is trying to trick me here. It's straightforward: which candy is traditionally fruit-flavored? Skittles fit the bill perfectly. So, I'm confident that B. Skittles is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Skittles}} \\]"
