                    "text": "So I've got this problem about springs and their force constants. It says that a spring with force constant k is stretched a certain distance, and it takes twice as much work to stretch a second spring by half this distance. I need to find the force constant of this second spring, and there are multiple choices: k, 2k, 4k, or 8k.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the work done in stretching a spring. I remember that the work done to stretch a spring from its natural length to some extended length is given by the integral of the force over the distance. The force exerted by a spring is described by Hooke's Law: F = kx, where k is the force constant and x is the extension.\n\nSo, the work done to stretch the spring from x=0 to some extension x is:\n\nW = \u222b from 0 to x of kx dx = [ (1/2)kx\u00b2 ] from 0 to x = (1/2)kx\u00b2 - 0 = (1/2)kx\u00b2\n\nLet's denote the extension of the first spring as x. So, the work done to stretch the first spring is (1/2)kx\u00b2.\n\nNow, the second spring is stretched by half this distance, so its extension is (x/2). Let\u2019s call the force constant of the second spring k2. Therefore, the work done to stretch the second spring is (1/2)k2(x/2)\u00b2 = (1/2)k2(x\u00b2/4) = (1/8)k2x\u00b2.\n\nAccording to the problem, it takes twice as much work to stretch the second spring by half the distance compared to stretching the first spring by the full distance.\n\nSo, the work for the second spring is twice the work for the first spring:\n\n(1/8)k2x\u00b2 = 2 * (1/2)kx\u00b2\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n(1/8)k2x\u00b2 = kx\u00b2\n\nNow, I can solve for k2:\n\nk2 = (8 * kx\u00b2) / x\u00b2 = 8k\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.\n\nI have (1/8)k2x\u00b2 = kx\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by x\u00b2 (assuming x \u2260 0):\n\n(1/8)k2 = k\n\nThen, multiply both sides by 8:\n\nk2 = 8k\n\nSo, the force constant of the second spring is 8k.\n\nBut let me see if this makes sense.\n\nIf the first spring is stretched by x, work = (1/2)kx\u00b2\n\nSecond spring is stretched by x/2, work = (1/2)k2(x/2)\u00b2 = (1/8)k2x\u00b2\n\nAnd this work is twice the work done on the first spring:\n\n(1/8)k2x\u00b2 = 2 * (1/2)kx\u00b2 = kx\u00b2\n\nSo, (1/8)k2x\u00b2 = kx\u00b2\n\nCancel x\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n(1/8)k2 = k\n\nThus, k2 = 8k\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions that it takes twice as much work to stretch the second spring by half the distance. So, if the first spring's work is W1 = (1/2)kx\u00b2, then the second spring's work is W2 = (1/2)k2(x/2)\u00b2, and W2 = 2 * W1.\n\nSo, (1/2)k2(x/2)\u00b2 = 2 * (1/2)kx\u00b2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1/2)k2(x\u00b2/4) = kx\u00b2\n\n(1/8)k2x\u00b2 = kx\u00b2\n\nAgain, dividing both sides by x\u00b2:\n\n(1/8)k2 = k\n\nThus, k2 = 8k\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 8k\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. Maybe I need to think about the relationship between the forces.\n\nFor the first spring, force F1 = kx\n\nFor the second spring, force F2 = k2(x/2)\n\nBut since we're dealing with work, which is the integral of force over distance, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for elastic potential energy, which is the same as the work done in stretching the spring.\n\nSo, sticking with that, I think 8k is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8k} \\]"
