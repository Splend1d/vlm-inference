Opportunistic organisation, B. Enterprising organisation, C. International organisation, and D. Agile organisation.\n\nHmm, let's see. I need to find the term that best describes an organization that can adapt quickly to changes in supply and demand. That sounds a lot like being flexible and able to move fast when the situation changes.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nFirst, an opportunistic organization. Opportunistic usually means seizing chances or taking advantage of circumstances as they arise. So, an opportunistic organization might be good at spotting opportunities and acting on them. But does that necessarily mean they adapt quickly to changes in supply and demand? Maybe, but it seems a bit broad. I'm not entirely sure.\n\nNext, enterprising organization. Enterprising sounds like it's about being entrepreneurial, taking initiatives, maybe innovating new products or services. While that's important, I'm not sure if it directly relates to quickly responding to shifts in supply and demand. Maybe it helps in the long run, but the question is more about adaptation to changes in the environment, particularly supply and demand.\n\nThen, international organization. This seems straightforward. It's an organization that operates across multiple countries. But that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with adapting to changes in supply and demand, at least not specifically. They might face more complex supply chains, but that's a different issue.\n\nLastly, agile organization. Agile is a term I've heard a lot lately, especially in business and software development. Agile methods are all about being able to respond quickly to change, iterating processes, and being flexible. In software development, agile methodologies like Scrum are designed to allow teams to adjust their work based on new information or changing requirements.\n\nThinking back to the question, an agile organization seems to fit the description of adapting to changes in the environment by quickly responding to shifts in supply and demand. The whole idea of agility is about being nimble and responsive to change, which aligns perfectly with what the question is asking.\n\nLet me double-check. Is there any other option that comes closer to this definition?\n\nOpportunistic organization might be good at taking advantage of opportunities, but it doesn't necessarily imply quick response to shifts in supply and demand. It could be more about seizing unexpected chances rather than systematically adapting to environmental changes.\n\nEnterprising organization seems more about initiative and innovation, not specifically about adaptation to supply and demand shifts.\n\nInternational organization is about operating globally, which again doesn't directly relate to adapting to changes in supply and demand.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate term for an organization that adapts to changes in the environment by quickly responding to shifts in supply and demand conditions is an agile organization.\n\nI think the answer is D. Agile organization.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
