                    "text": "So I have this question about the correlation coefficient, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that the correlation coefficient and the slope of the regression line may have opposite signs. Hmm, I remember that the correlation coefficient and the slope are related, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think about this. The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables, and the slope of the regression line also indicates the direction of the relationship. So, if the correlation is positive, the slope should also be positive, right? And if the correlation is negative, the slope should be negative. Does that mean they always have the same sign? It seems like they do, so option A might not be correct.\n\nOption B says that a correlation of 1 indicates a perfect cause-and-effect relationship between the variables. I know that correlation doesn't imply causation. Even if two variables have a correlation of 1, which means there's a perfect linear relationship between them, it doesn't necessarily mean that one causes the other. There could be other factors at play, or it could be a spurious correlation. So, this statement seems incorrect because it equates a perfect correlation with a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nOption C says that correlations of +0.87 and -0.87 indicate the same degree of clustering around the regression line. This sounds familiar. I think the magnitude of the correlation coefficient indicates the strength of the linear relationship, regardless of the sign. So, a correlation of +0.87 and -0.87 both indicate a strong linear relationship, just with different directions. The sign tells us whether the relationship is positive or negative, but the absolute value tells us how closely the points cluster around the regression line. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption D says that correlation applies equally well to quantitative and categorical data. I don't think that's right. Correlation coefficients, like Pearson's or Spearman's, are typically used for quantitative variables. Categorical data, like nominal or ordinal variables, aren't suitable for correlation analysis unless they're converted into a quantitative form, like through dummy variables in some cases. So, this statement seems incorrect.\n\nBased on my reasoning, option C seems to be the correct answer. It correctly states that the magnitude of the correlation coefficient indicates the strength of the linear relationship, irrespective of the sign, which denotes the direction of the relationship.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check each option quickly.\n\nA: The correlation coefficient and the slope of the regression line do have the same sign. The formula for the slope in simple linear regression involves the correlation coefficient and the standard deviations of the variables, and the sign of the correlation determines the sign of the slope. So, they don't have opposite signs.\n\nB: While a correlation of 1 does indicate a perfect linear relationship, it doesn't establish causation. There could be other explanations for the relationship, such as confounding variables or coincidental correlations.\n\nC: This seems accurate. The absolute value of the correlation coefficient measures the strength of the linear association, and the sign indicates the direction. So, +0.87 and -0.87 both indicate strong clustering around the regression line, just in opposite directions.\n\nD: Correlation methods are designed for quantitative data. Categorical data require different statistical approaches, such as contingency table analysis or logistic regression.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. Correlations of +0.87 and -0.87 indicate the same degree of clustering around the regression line.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
