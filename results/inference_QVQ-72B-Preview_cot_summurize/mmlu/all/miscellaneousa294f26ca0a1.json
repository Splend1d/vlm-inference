                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what \"au gratin\" means in cooking. It's a term I've heard before, but I'm not entirely sure about its exact meaning. The question says it's sometimes used to describe a dish with a particular topping, and the options are cheese, fruit, gravy, or whipped cream.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"au gratin\" refers to. From what I recall, it's a French culinary term. A quick search confirms that \"au gratin\" is indeed French and generally refers to a dish that's covered with a topping that's then browned, usually under a broiler or in an oven.\n\nBut what exactly is that topping? The options given are cheese, fruit, gravy, or whipped cream. Let me think about this.\n\nI know that some classic dishes like potatoes au gratin or cauliflower au gratin exist. In these dishes, the ingredients are typically layered with cheese and a creamy sauce, then baked until the top is golden brown and crispy. So, in this case, the topping seems to be cheese.\n\nBut maybe it's not always cheese. Could it be fruit? I'm trying to think of any dishes where fruit is used as a topping in this way. I can think of grilled peaches or apples, but I don't recall them being referred to as \"au gratin.\" Maybe not.\n\nWhat about gravy? Gravy is often poured over dishes like roasts or pies, but I don't think it's typically browned or crisped in the same way as \"au gratin\" dishes. Plus, gravy doesn't really fit the description of a topping that's browned to create a crispy layer.\n\nWhipped cream seems unlikely too. Whipped cream is usually associated with desserts and is served cold, not baked or browned. It doesn't seem to fit the definition of \"au gratin.\"\n\nSo, based on my knowledge of classic \"au gratin\" dishes, it seems that cheese is the common topping that's browned to create that characteristic crusty top.\n\nLet me double-check this. I found a definition that says \"au gratin\" refers to a dish that's topped with a bread crumb or cheese covering that's then browned. So, it could be either bread crumbs or cheese. However, in practice, I think cheese is more commonly used, especially in dishes like potatoes au gratin or vegetables au gratin.\n\nI'm trying to recall if there are any dishes where bread crumbs are used as the topping in an \"au gratin\" preparation. For example, in some recipes for scalloped potatoes, bread crumbs might be used instead of cheese for the topping. So, perhaps the topping isn't always cheese.\n\nBut in the majority of cases, especially in contemporary cooking, \"au gratin\" seems to be associated with a cheesy topping. Additionally, the term \"gratin\" often implies a cheesy crust that's been browned to perfection.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the best answer is cheese. While there might be instances where other toppings are used, cheese is the most common and traditional topping for \"au gratin\" dishes.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider each option again:\n\nA. cheese: highly likely and fits the description.\n\nB. fruit: not typically used as a topping for browning in \"au gratin\" dishes.\n\nC. gravy: generally not a topping that's browned to create a crispy layer.\n\nD. whipped cream: usually not baked and doesn't fit the definition.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is A. cheese.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ cheese}} \\]"
