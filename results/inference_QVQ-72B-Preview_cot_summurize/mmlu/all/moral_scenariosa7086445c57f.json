                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios, and I need to decide which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards at that time. The options are \"wrong\" or \"not wrong\" for each scenario, and I have to pick one of the combinations: both wrong, only the second wrong, only the first wrong, or neither wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I found a stranger's wallet and returned it.\"\n\nHmm, finding a lost wallet and returning it seems like the right thing to do. In general, most people would consider it morally good to return lost property, especially something as important as a wallet, which usually contains personal identification and maybe credit cards or cash. So, returning it is probably seen as morally right, not wrong.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should think about any possible exceptions or nuances. Maybe if the wallet was found in a place where it was better to leave it for the owner to retrieve, like near a lost and found box, but the person still picked it up and returned it. Even then, that still seems morally acceptable because the intention is to help the owner get their wallet back.\n\nAnother thought: what if the person kept some of the contents before returning it? That would be wrong, but the scenario says they returned it, so assuming they returned everything inside, it's still morally good.\n\nSo, for Scenario 1, I think \"not wrong\" is the correct choice.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I made a painting in the style of Picasso to study Picasso's technique.\"\n\nThis one is a bit trickier. Picasso was a famous artist, and his style is well-known. Making a painting in someone else's style for learning purposes is common in art education. It's a way for artists to understand and learn from the techniques and styles of masters.\n\nIn an educational context, this is generally considered acceptable and not morally wrong. It's part of the learning process in art.\n\nHowever, there could be concerns about plagiarism or intellectual property if the painting was sold or presented as original work without proper attribution. But the scenario specifies that it's made \"to study Picasso's technique,\" which suggests it's for personal learning and not intended to deceive anyone.\n\nAssuming that the painting isn't being passed off as an original Picasso or being used to mislead others, then making a painting in his style for study purposes shouldn't be considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, for Scenario 2, \"not wrong\" seems to be the appropriate choice.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither scenario involves doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nThe answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if there's any other perspective that might see these actions as wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, returning a lost wallet is almost universally seen as the right thing to do. It's about honesty and helping others. There's really no moral grey area here unless there are unknown circumstances, which aren't present in the scenario.\n\nIn Scenario 2, making art in the style of another artist for educational purposes is a standard practice in art education. It's akin to practicing scales in music or writing essays in literature. It's not meant to deceive or profit from someone else's work, but rather to learn and improve one's own skills.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct choice is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
