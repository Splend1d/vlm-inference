                    "text": "So I've got this property law scenario here, and I need to figure out whether the investor has a right to use the right-of-way across the orange grove. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's an orange grove, which is a 10-acre tract, and a vineyard, which is a 20-acre tract to the north of the orange grove. In 2006, a farmer buys the orange grove in fee simple absolute. The vineyard is owned by a rancher in fee simple absolute. There's a history here: a remote predecessor of the farmer granted a way for egress and ingress across the orange grove to a shepherd, and this was done in such a way that it created an easement appurtenant to the vineyard. This easement was properly recorded, but the shepherd never actually used it.\n\nIn 2010, the rancher sells the vineyard to the farmer. Then, in 2011, the farmer sells the vineyard to an investor for $200,000. Neither of these deeds mentions the easement for the right-of-way. Now, the investor claims she has a right to use this right-of-way across the orange grove, but the farmer says no such easement exists.\n\nThe question is, if the investor sues to determine her right to use the right-of-way, should she prevail?\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. Prevail, because an easement by implication arose from the farmer's conveyance to the investor.\n\nB. Prevail, because once an easement is properly recorded, it remains in effect ad finem until expressly released.\n\nC. Not prevail, because any easements were extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired a fee simple in the vineyard.\n\nD. Not prevail, because the deed of conveyance from the farmer to the investor failed to contain any mention of the right-of-way.\n\nOkay, let's analyze each option.\n\nStarting with option A: easement by implication from the farmer's conveyance to the investor. Easement by implication usually arises when there's a necessity for access, like when a landlocked property needs access to a public road. But in this case, the vineyard already has access to a public highway via the orange grove, and the orange grove abuts a public highway. So, I'm not sure if necessity is an issue here. Maybe this isn't the right approach.\n\nOption B: once an easement is properly recorded, it remains in effect ad finem until expressly released. Ad finem means \"to the end\" or \"until the end,\" but I think it's being used here to mean \"permanently\" or \"indefinitely.\" So, the idea is that once an easement is recorded, it stays in effect unless it's explicitly released or terminated through some legal process. That makes sense, but there might be more to it.\n\nOption C: not prevail because easements were extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired a fee simple in the vineyard. Merger can happen when the owner of the dominant tenement (the vineyard) acquires the servient tenement (the orange grove). But in this case, the farmer already owned the orange grove and then bought the vineyard. So, did the farmer own both the dominant and servient tenements after 2010? If so, then the easement could have been extinguished by merger. But I need to check the details.\n\nOption D: not prevail because the deed from farmer to investor didn't mention the right-of-way. This seems like a straightforward argument, but I suspect there's more to it. Just because something isn't mentioned in the deed doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't exist, especially if it's a recorded easement.\n\nLet me think about the chain of events.\n\n1. Remote predecessor of the farmer grants an easement for right-of-way across the orange grove to the shepherd, for the benefit of the vineyard.\n\n2. This easement is properly recorded, so it's part of the public record.\n\n3. The shepherd never uses the easement.\n\n4. Rancher owns the vineyard.\n\n5. Farmer buys the orange grove.\n\n6. Rancher sells the vineyard to the farmer.\n\n7. Farmer sells the vineyard to the investor.\n\nNow, when the rancher sells the vineyard to the farmer, does the easement pass with it? Generally, easements appurtenant to a property pass with the property unless there's an express intention to terminate them. Since the deed from rancher to farmer didn't mention the easement, it likely passed with the vineyard.\n\nBut then, the farmer sells the vineyard to the investor, again without mentioning the easement. So, does the investor get the benefit of the easement?\n\nHere's where things get tricky. The farmer already owned both the orange grove and the vineyard after 2010. Did the easement continue to exist during that time?\n\nWait, when the farmer owned both the orange grove and the vineyard, the easement might have been extinguished by merger because the same person owned both the dominant and servient tenements. That's a principle in property law: when the same person owns both the dominant and servient estates, the easement is extinguished.\n\nSo, when the farmer bought the vineyard in 2010, if the easement hadn't been extinguished before, it would be extinguished at that point.\n\nThen, when the farmer sells the vineyard to the investor in 2011, the easement wouldn't pass to the investor because it was extinguished by the merger when the farmer owned both properties.\n\nBut wait, the orange grove and the vineyard are separate properties; the farmer still owns the orange grove. Does that mean the easement was revived when the farmer sold the vineyard to the investor?\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here. Let me look up the concept of merger in easements.\n\nMerger occurs when the owner of the dominant tenement acquires the servient tenement, or vice versa. At that point, the easement is extinguished because there's no longer a need for one person to have rights over another's land when both are owned by the same person.\n\nSo, when the farmer bought the vineyard in 2010, the farmer owned both the dominant (vineyard) and servient (orange grove) tenements. Therefore, the easement was extinguished by merger at that point.\n\nThen, when the farmer sold the vineyard to the investor in 2011, the easement didn't pass to the investor because it had already been extinguished.\n\nTherefore, the investor does not have a right to use the right-of-way across the orange grove.\n\nSo, according to this reasoning, the investor should not prevail. But let's see which option matches this conclusion.\n\nOption C says: not prevail, because any easements were extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired a fee simple in the vineyard.\n\nThat seems to align with my reasoning. The farmer acquired the vineyard in 2010, owning both the orange grove and the vineyard, leading to the easement being extinguished by merger.\n\nOption D says: not prevail, because the deed from farmer to investor failed to mention the right-of-way.\n\nBut in this case, the easement was already extinguished by merger before the deed was even issued, so it wouldn't be included in the deed anyway.\n\nSo, between options C and D, C seems more accurate because the easement was extinguished by merger, making it non-existent at the time of the conveyance to the investor.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there are any other factors at play.\n\nThe fact that the orange grove abuts a public highway and the vineyard has access to that highway via the orange grove suggests that the vineyard isn't landlocked. If the vineyard had no other access to a public road, there might be an argument for an easement by necessity, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nAlso, the fact that the easement was recorded and properly executed means it was valid until extinguished by some means, like merger.\n\nSo, I think option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
