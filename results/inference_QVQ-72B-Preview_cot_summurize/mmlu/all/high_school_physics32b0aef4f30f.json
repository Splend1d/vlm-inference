                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a simple spring-block oscillator with spring constant \\(k\\) and amplitude \\(A\\). The original block has a mass \\(m\\), and then a small block of mass \\(m\\) is placed on top of it. We need to figure out when the small block is most likely to slide off and what condition must be satisfied for it not to slide off, in terms of the coefficient of static friction between the blocks.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the motion of the oscillator. The original block is oscillating horizontally, right? Since it's a horizontal spring-block oscillator, the restoring force is \\(F = -kx\\), where \\(x\\) is the displacement from the equilibrium position. The amplitude \\(A\\) is the maximum displacement from equilibrium.\n\nWhen the small block is placed on top of the original block, the total mass oscillating becomes \\(m + m = 2m\\). So, the system now consists of the two blocks moving together as long as the small block doesn't slide off.\n\nI need to think about the forces acting on the small block. The small block will experience a static friction force from the original block, which prevents it from sliding. This friction force is what keeps the small block moving with the original block.\n\nThe maximum static friction force is \\(\\mu_s N\\), where \\(\\mu_s\\) is the coefficient of static friction and \\(N\\) is the normal force. Since the small block is on top of the original block, the normal force is equal to the weight of the small block, which is \\(mg\\). So, the maximum static friction force is \\(\\mu_s mg\\).\n\nNow, for the small block not to slide off, the static friction force must be sufficient to provide the necessary centripetal force for its motion with the original block. Wait, but this is simple harmonic motion, not circular motion, so maybe \"centripetal force\" isn't the right term here. Maybe I need to think in terms of the acceleration of the block.\n\nIn simple harmonic motion, the acceleration is given by \\(a = -\\omega^2 x\\), where \\(\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{2m}}\\) because the total mass is \\(2m\\). So, the acceleration of the original block is \\(a = -\\frac{k}{2m} x\\).\n\nThe small block needs to have the same acceleration as the original block to move with it. Therefore, the net force on the small block should be \\(ma = m \\left(-\\frac{k}{2m} x\\right) = -\\frac{k}{2} x\\).\n\nThis force is provided by the static friction force between the blocks. So, \\(f = m \\left(-\\frac{k}{2} x\\right)\\). Since the friction force can't exceed its maximum value, we have:\n\n\\(|f| \\leq \\mu_s mg\\)\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\(\\left| m \\left(-\\frac{k}{2} x\\right) \\right| \\leq \\mu_s mg\\)\n\nSimplifying,\n\n\\(\\frac{k}{2} |x| \\leq \\mu_s g\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\(|x| \\leq \\frac{2 \\mu_s g}{k}\\)\n\nBut the amplitude \\(A\\) is the maximum displacement, so \\(|x| \\leq A\\). Therefore,\n\n\\(A \\leq \\frac{2 \\mu_s g}{k}\\)\n\nRearranging,\n\n\\(\\mu_s \\geq \\frac{k A}{2 g}\\)\n\nWait, but in the options, they have \\(\\mu_s \\geq \\frac{k A}{(2m) g}\\), because the total mass is \\(2m\\). Let me check that again.\n\nActually, in my earlier step, I considered the acceleration of the small block as \\(a = -\\frac{k}{2m} x\\), which is correct because the spring is attached to the system of both blocks, so the effective mass is \\(2m\\).\n\nThen, the force on the small block is \\(f = m a = m \\left(-\\frac{k}{2m} x\\right) = -\\frac{k}{2} x\\).\n\nThis force is provided by friction, so \\(f = \\mu_s N = \\mu_s mg\\).\n\nSetting them equal,\n\n\\(\\left| -\\frac{k}{2} x \\right| = \\mu_s mg\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\(\\frac{k}{2} x = \\mu_s mg\\)\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\(x = \\frac{2 \\mu_s mg}{k}\\)\n\nBut the amplitude is \\(A\\), so at maximum displacement \\(x = A\\), we have:\n\n\\(A = \\frac{2 \\mu_s mg}{k}\\)\n\nSolving for \\(\\mu_s\\),\n\n\\(\\mu_s = \\frac{k A}{2 m g}\\)\n\nWait, but in the options, they have \\((M + m)g\\), which would be \\(2m g\\), so \\(\\mu_s \\geq \\frac{k A}{2 m g}\\), which matches my result.\n\nNow, regarding when the small block is most likely to slide off. The friction force is maximum when the acceleration is maximum, which occurs at the maximum displacement \\(A\\). So, the small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at maximum displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. The small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, but will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than \\(k A / [(M + m) g]\\).\n\nB. The small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at the equilibrium position, but will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than \\(k A / [(M + m) g]\\).\n\nC. The small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, but will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than \\((M + m) g / (k A)\\).\n\nD. The small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at the equilibrium position, but will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than \\((M + m) g / (k A)\\).\n\nFrom my earlier reasoning, the small block is most likely to slide off at maximum displacement, so options B and D can be eliminated.\n\nAlso, the condition for no sliding is \\(\\mu_s \\geq \\frac{k A}{2 m g}\\), and since \\(M + m = 2m\\), \\(\\frac{k A}{(M + m) g} = \\frac{k A}{2 m g}\\), which matches my result.\n\nTherefore, the correct option should be A.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nWait a minute, in option A, it says \"greater than\" \\(k A / [(M + m) g]\\), but according to my calculation, it should be \"greater than or equal to\" because at equality, it's the maximum friction, but not necessarily sliding. So, perhaps it should be \"greater than or equal to,\" but in the options, it's just \"greater than.\"\n\nHowever, in such problems, \"greater than\" is often used to indicate the condition, even if \"greater than or equal to\" might be more precise. So, I think option A is essentially correct.\n\nOption C has \\((M + m) g / (k A)\\), which is the reciprocal of what I calculated, so that's incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
