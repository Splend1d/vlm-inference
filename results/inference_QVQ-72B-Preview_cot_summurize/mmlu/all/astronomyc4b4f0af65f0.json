                    "text": "So I have this question here about meteorites and what they reveal about the solar system. There are four options, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that meteorites reveal the early solar system consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium gas. Hmm, I know that hydrogen and helium are the most abundant elements in the universe, and they make up most of the sun and the outer planets. But meteorites are mostly rocky or metallic, right? So, do meteorites directly reveal the composition of the early solar system? Maybe not directly, because meteorites are solid objects, and their composition might not represent the gaseous components of the early solar system. Maybe this isn't the best choice.\n\nOption B says that meteorites are much older than comets and planets. Wait, I thought that meteorites, comets, and planets all formed around the same time, about 4.6 billion years ago, from the solar nebula. Some meteorites are indeed very old, and they can provide insights into the early solar system, but saying they are much older than comets and planets doesn't seem right. Maybe this is incorrect.\n\nOption C says that meteorites reveal that the age of the solar system is approximately 4.6 billion years. This sounds familiar. I recall that by dating meteorites using radiometric dating methods, scientists have determined that some meteorites are about 4.6 billion years old. Since these meteorites formed around the same time as the solar system, this gives us an estimate of the solar system's age. So, this seems like a plausible answer.\n\nOption D says that meteorites reveal that the solar system once contained 10 planets. I'm pretty sure that our solar system has eight planets, not ten. Even if you include dwarf planets like Pluto, which was reclassified in 2006, it still doesn't add up to ten. So, this seems incorrect based on what I know about our solar system's structure.\n\nAfter considering all the options, Option C seems to be the most accurate statement based on my knowledge. Meteorites do provide crucial information about the age of the solar system, and 4.6 billion years is a widely accepted figure derived from studying these celestial bodies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
