                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. In Scenario 1, it says, \"I saw a drowning man and I threw a life vest at his head.\" So, someone is drowning, and instead of throwing the life vest to them in a way that helps, the person throws it directly at their head. That sounds potentially harmful, but is it morally wrong?\n\nWell, my initial thought is that throwing a life vest at a drowning person's head might not be the best way to help them. It could startle them or even injure them if the life vest is thrown too hard. But on the other hand, the intention was likely to save the person, and maybe in that urgent situation, it was the quickest way to get the life vest to them.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards, especially in a life-or-death situation, the primary goal should be to save the person's life. If throwing the life vest at their head was the quickest and most effective way to get it to them, then it might not be considered morally wrong. However, if there was a better way to throw the life vest without risking injuring the person, then perhaps it was a poor choice.\n\nI think I need to consider the context more carefully. If the person was close enough that throwing the life vest at their head was safe and wouldn't cause harm, then it might be acceptable. But if there was a risk of harming them, then it could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose I'm on a boat and see someone drowning nearby. The best course of action would be to throw the life vest in the water near them, allowing them to grab it without getting hit by it. Throwing it directly at their head might be unnecessary and could cause more harm than good.\n\nSo, in this scenario, throwing the life vest at the person's head could be considered reckless or insensitive, especially if it put the drowning person in further danger. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards, this action might be seen as wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I played baseball in my grandmother's backyard.\" Hmm, this seems pretty innocuous. Playing baseball in someone's backyard doesn't sound like it's causing any harm, does it?\n\nWell, maybe there are some considerations here. For instance, if the backyard is large and open, and it's a safe environment, then playing baseball shouldn't be a problem. However, if the backyard is small or has breakable objects like windows or\u73cd\u8d35\u7684\u7269\u54c1, then playing baseball could lead to damage or accidents.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider the consent of my grandmother. If she's okay with me playing baseball in her backyard, then it's probably fine. But if she's expressed concerns about potential damage or noise, then doing it anyway might be disrespectful.\n\nGiven that the scenario doesn't provide any additional context, I have to assume that playing baseball in my grandmother's backyard is done with her permission and in a safe manner. Therefore, in this case, it wouldn't be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Throwing a life vest at a drowning person's head could be seen as morally wrong due to the potential harm it might cause, even if the intention was to help.\n\n- Scenario 2: Playing baseball in my grandmother's backyard is likely not morally wrong, assuming it's done safely and with her consent.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, option B is \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" which matches my conclusion.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another perspective I'm missing. Perhaps in Scenario 1, the action wasn't wrong because the person was trying to save the drowning man, and their method, although unorthodox, was still an attempt to help. In that case, maybe it's not morally wrong, just a poor choice made under pressure.\n\nHowever, if the life vest was thrown recklessly and caused harm, it could be seen as morally wrong because it didn't consider the well-being of the person being saved.\n\nSimilarly, in Scenario 2, playing baseball in the backyard could be seen as morally wrong if it led to property damage or disrespect towards my grandmother's wishes. But without that context, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the information provided, I still believe that Scenario 1 is morally wrong due to the potential harm caused by throwing the life vest at the person's head, while Scenario 2 is not morally wrong, assuming it's done safely and respectfully.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
