                    "text": "So Lucy is making gift baskets, and she puts 3 apples in each basket. She has 24 apples in total, and she wants to find out how many gift baskets, b, she can make with those apples. I need to figure out which number sentence correctly represents this situation.\n\nLet's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A is 24 + 3 = b. Hmm, this seems like adding 24 and 3 to get b. But that doesn't make much sense because we're trying to find the number of baskets based on the total apples and the apples per basket. Adding 24 and 3 doesn't help us find the number of baskets. Maybe this isn't the right one.\n\nOption B is 3 + b = 24. This seems similar to the first option. It's adding 3 and b to get 24. But again, I'm not sure how this relates to finding the number of baskets. Maybe this isn't correct either.\n\nOption C is 24 \u00f7 b = 3. This seems interesting. If I divide the total number of apples (24) by the number of baskets (b), I should get the number of apples per basket, which is 3. So, 24 divided by b equals 3. That makes sense. But wait, is this the best way to represent it?\n\nOption D is 3 \u00d7 24 = b. This suggests that multiplying the number of apples per basket by the total number of apples gives the number of baskets. But that doesn't seem right. If I multiply 3 apples per basket by 24 apples, I'd get 72, which would be the total number of apples if there were b baskets. But that doesn't give me the number of baskets. So, this probably isn't the correct choice.\n\nLet me think again. I have 24 apples, and each basket gets 3 apples. I need to find out how many baskets I can make. So, essentially, I'm dividing the total apples by the apples per basket to get the number of baskets.\n\nSo, b = 24 \u00f7 3.\n\nThat means b = 8 baskets.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 24 \u00f7 b = 3. If I rearrange this, it would be b = 24 \u00f7 3, which also gives b = 8. That matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to represent this?\n\nOption B is 3 + b = 24. If I solve for b, b = 24 - 3, which is b = 21. That doesn't match my earlier result of b = 8.\n\nOption A is 24 + 3 = b, which would be b = 27. That's not matching either.\n\nOption D is 3 \u00d7 24 = b, which is b = 72. That's also not matching.\n\nSo, only option C correctly represents the relationship between the total apples, the apples per basket, and the number of baskets.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of multiplication. If each basket has 3 apples, and there are b baskets, then 3 \u00d7 b = 24. So, 3b = 24.\n\nThen, to solve for b, I would divide both sides by 3: b = 24 \u00f7 3, which again gives b = 8.\n\nSo, both approaches lead me to the same answer, b = 8.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 24 \u00f7 b = 3, which is equivalent to b = 24 \u00f7 3, confirming b = 8.\n\nTherefore, the correct number sentence is option C: 24 \u00f7 b = 3.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
