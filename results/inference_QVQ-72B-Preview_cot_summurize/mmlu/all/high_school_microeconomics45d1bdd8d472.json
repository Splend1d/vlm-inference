                    "text": "Let's see here. Nancy has three options: study for an exam, mow the lawn for $6, or babysit her niece for $8. She chose to study. I need to figure out which statement is true about this situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what opportunity cost is. Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative that you give up when you choose something else. So, in this case, when Nancy chooses to study, she's giving up the money she could have made from mowing the lawn or babysitting.\n\nLet me think about the benefits and costs here. If she studies, the benefit is presumably the improvement in her exam performance, right? But the question doesn't give a monetary value to that benefit. It's comparing the benefit of studying to the opportunity cost in dollars.\n\nOption A says that the benefit received from studying is greater than the opportunity cost of $8. Wait, is the opportunity cost $8? Well, she could have made $8 from babysitting, so that seems like the highest-paying alternative, so her opportunity cost is $8.\n\nBut hold on, maybe I should consider both options. She could have mowed the lawn for $6 or babysat for $8. Since $8 is higher, that's the relevant opportunity cost.\n\nSo, if she chose to study because the benefit is greater than $8, that makes sense. But the question says \"the benefit received from studying is greater than the opportunity cost of $8.\" Wait, it says \"the opportunity cost of $8,\" which seems correct because babysitting pays $8, which is the highest alternative.\n\nBut let's look at option B: \"The opportunity cost of studying is $14, which is less than the benefit received from studying.\" Hmm, where does the $14 come from? Wait, maybe it's adding $6 and $8, but that doesn't make sense in this context. The opportunity cost should be the value of the best alternative forgone, which is $8, not $14.\n\nOption C says Nancy is indifferent to both studying and mowing the lawn. But the problem states that she chose to study, so being indifferent would mean she's equally happy with studying or mowing, but since she chose to study, it suggests she prefers it over mowing.\n\nOption D says Nancy's behavior is irrational because babysitting was clearly superior to all other options. But maybe studying has non-monetary benefits that make it a rational choice.\n\nLet me think more carefully. The key point is that Nancy chose to study, presumably because the benefit she gets from studying is worth more to her than the $8 she could have made from babysitting. So, her subjective benefit from studying outweighs the monetary opportunity cost.\n\nTherefore, option A seems to capture that: the benefit from studying is greater than the opportunity cost of $8.\n\nOption B is confusing because it mentions an opportunity cost of $14, which doesn't align with the scenario. Maybe it's a mistake.\n\nOption C suggests indifference, but since she chose to study, it's unlikely she's indifferent.\n\nOption D claims her behavior is irrational, but without more information about her preferences, we can't necessarily conclude that.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option A seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
