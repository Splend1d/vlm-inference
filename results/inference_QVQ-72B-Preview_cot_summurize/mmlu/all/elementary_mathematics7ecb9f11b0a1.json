                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Mr. Kohlberg starts with 152 roses. He sells 96 of them. I need to find out how many roses are left after that sale and then divide those remaining roses equally among 8 vases. Finally, I need to figure out how many roses are in each vase.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many roses are left after selling 96. If he had 152 roses and sold 96, I need to subtract 96 from 152. Let's see, 152 minus 96. I can break it down: 152 - 90 = 62, and then 62 - 6 = 56. So, there are 56 roses left.\n\nNext, he wants to divide these 56 roses equally among 8 vases. To find out how many roses go into each vase, I need to divide 56 by 8. 56 divided by 8 equals 7. So, each vase will have 7 roses.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 7\n\nB. 12\n\nC. 48\n\nD. 56\n\nMy answer matches option A. 7.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at it. Maybe I can use multiplication to verify. If each vase has 7 roses, and there are 8 vases, then 7 times 8 is 56, which matches the number of roses left after selling. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the total roses initially and the roses sold, 152 - 96 = 56, and then dividing by 8, 56 \u00f7 8 = 7. Again, that confirms that each vase gets 7 roses.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here; it seems straightforward. No need to consider anything else like different vase sizes or anything like that. The problem is clear in its instructions.\n\nSo, the final answer is 7 roses in each vase, which corresponds to option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 7} \\]"
