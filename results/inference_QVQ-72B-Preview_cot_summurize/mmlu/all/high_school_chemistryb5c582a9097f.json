                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about a chemical reaction that's nonspontaneous at 1 atm and 298 K, but becomes spontaneous when the temperature drops to -78\u00b0C using dry ice. I need to figure out which combination of \u0394H, \u0394S, and \u0394G must apply to this reaction based on the given options.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what \u0394H, \u0394S, and \u0394G represent. \u0394H is the change in enthalpy, which relates to the heat absorbed or released in a reaction. If \u0394H is negative, the reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases heat. If \u0394H is positive, the reaction is endothermic, meaning it absorbs heat.\n\n\u0394S is the change in entropy, which measures the disorder or randomness in a system. If \u0394S is positive, the reaction leads to an increase in disorder. If \u0394S is negative, the reaction leads to a decrease in disorder.\n\n\u0394G is the change in Gibbs free energy, which determines whether a reaction is spontaneous or not. If \u0394G is negative, the reaction is spontaneous. If \u0394G is positive, the reaction is nonspontaneous. If \u0394G is zero, the reaction is at equilibrium.\n\nThe relationship between \u0394G, \u0394H, and \u0394S is given by the equation:\n\n\u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S\n\nwhere T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nNow, the problem states that at 298 K (which is 25\u00b0C), the reaction is nonspontaneous, so \u0394G > 0. When the temperature drops to -78\u00b0C (which is 298 K - 78 K = 220 K), the reaction becomes spontaneous, so \u0394G < 0.\n\nI need to find which combination of \u0394H and \u0394S must be true for this scenario.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nOption A: \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G = 0\n\nBut the problem says that at 298 K, \u0394G > 0 (nonspontaneous), not equal to zero. So, this option doesn't match.\n\nOption B: \u0394H > 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G > 0\n\nAt 298 K, if \u0394H is positive and \u0394S is negative, then \u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S would be positive, which matches the nonspontaneous behavior at 298 K.\n\nAt 220 K, \u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S. Since both \u0394H and \u0394S are positive numbers, decreasing T would make T\u0394S smaller, potentially making \u0394G negative.\n\nWait, \u0394S is negative, so -T\u0394S would become less negative as T decreases, which could make \u0394G more negative.\n\nWait, no: \u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S. If \u0394S is negative, then T\u0394S is negative. So, \u0394G = \u0394H + |T\u0394S|. If \u0394H is positive and T\u0394S is negative, then \u0394G is positive. When T decreases, T\u0394S becomes less negative (since it's multiplied by a smaller T), so \u0394G decreases, potentially becoming negative.\n\nSo, yes, in this case, decreasing temperature could make \u0394G negative, making the reaction spontaneous.\n\nOption C: \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G > 0\n\nAt 298 K, \u0394H is negative (exothermic), \u0394S is negative (decrease in disorder). \u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S.\n\nIf \u0394H is negative and \u0394S is negative, \u0394G could be positive or negative depending on the magnitudes.\n\nAt 298 K, \u0394G > 0 (nonspontaneous). At 220 K, \u0394G < 0 (spontaneous).\n\nLet's see: \u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S.\n\nIf \u0394H is negative and \u0394S is negative, decreasing T would make T\u0394S less negative, which could make \u0394G more negative, potentially crossing zero.\n\nBut in this case, since both \u0394H and \u0394S are negative, \u0394G could be positive if the magnitude of \u0394H is less than T\u0394S.\n\nWait, \u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S.\n\nIf \u0394H is negative and \u0394S is negative, then \u0394G could be positive if |\u0394H| < |T\u0394S|.\n\nAt 298 K, \u0394G > 0, so |\u0394H| < |298\u0394S|.\n\nAt 220 K, \u0394G < 0, so |\u0394H| > |220\u0394S|.\n\nThis is possible if \u0394S is negative and |\u0394H| < |298\u0394S| but > |220\u0394S|.\n\nSo, this option is also possible.\n\nOption D: \u0394H > 0, \u0394S > 0, and \u0394G > 0\n\nAt 298 K, \u0394G > 0 (nonspontaneous). At 220 K, \u0394G < 0 (spontaneous).\n\n\u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S.\n\nIf \u0394H is positive and \u0394S is positive, \u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S.\n\nAt 298 K, \u0394G > 0: \u0394H - 298\u0394S > 0 \u21d2 \u0394H > 298\u0394S.\n\nAt 220 K, \u0394G < 0: \u0394H - 220\u0394S < 0 \u21d2 \u0394H < 220\u0394S.\n\nThis would require that \u0394H is between 220\u0394S and 298\u0394S.\n\nBut since \u0394S is positive, decreasing T would make T\u0394S smaller, and \u0394G could become negative.\n\nHowever, in this case, \u0394H is positive and greater than 220\u0394S but less than 298\u0394S.\n\nThis is possible, but let's see if this matches the options.\n\nWait, option D says \u0394G > 0, but at 220 K, \u0394G < 0, which contradicts the option.\n\nSo, option D is incorrect.\n\nNow, between options B and C, both can lead to \u0394G > 0 at 298 K and \u0394G < 0 at 220 K.\n\nBut the problem asks which combination must apply.\n\nI need to see which one necessarily leads to the observed behavior.\n\nLet's consider the signs:\n\nIn option B: \u0394H > 0, \u0394S < 0.\n\nIn option C: \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0.\n\nBoth can lead to \u0394G > 0 at 298 K and \u0394G < 0 at 220 K, depending on the magnitudes.\n\nBut the problem specifies that cooling with dry ice makes the reaction spontaneous, implying that the reaction becomes exothermic or something.\n\nWait, no, it just says cooling makes it spontaneous, doesn't specify the sign of \u0394H.\n\nBut option B has \u0394H > 0, which is endothermic, and option C has \u0394H < 0, which is exothermic.\n\nSo, if the reaction is endothermic (\u0394H > 0), cooling would make it less spontaneous, but according to option B, it becomes spontaneous at lower temperatures.\n\nWait, no: if \u0394H > 0 and \u0394S < 0, then \u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S.\n\nAt higher T, T\u0394S is more negative, so \u0394G is less positive, but in this case, \u0394S is negative, so -T\u0394S is positive.\n\nWait, \u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S.\n\nIf \u0394H > 0 and \u0394S < 0, then T\u0394S is negative, so \u0394G = \u0394H + |T\u0394S|.\n\nAs T decreases, |T\u0394S| decreases, so \u0394G decreases, potentially becoming negative.\n\nSo, yes, in this case, cooling could make the reaction spontaneous.\n\nSimilarly, in option C, \u0394H < 0 and \u0394S < 0.\n\n\u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S = \u0394H + |T\u0394S|.\n\nAt higher T, |T\u0394S| is larger, so \u0394G could be positive if |\u0394H| < |T\u0394S|.\n\nAt lower T, |T\u0394S| is smaller, so \u0394G could be negative if |\u0394H| > |T\u0394S|.\n\nSo, both options can lead to the observed behavior.\n\nBut the problem says \"must apply\", meaning which one must be true.\n\nSo, if both options B and C can lead to the observed behavior, then neither is necessarily the only one that must apply.\n\nTherefore, perhaps none of the options are correct, or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, option A says \u0394G = 0, but the problem says \u0394G > 0 at 298 K, so option A is incorrect.\n\nOption D says \u0394G > 0 at 298 K, but the problem says \u0394G < 0 at 220 K, so option D is incorrect.\n\nBetween options B and C, both can lead to the observed behavior, but the problem says \"must apply\", meaning which one must be true.\n\nIf both can lead to the observed behavior, then perhaps neither must apply, but the problem seems to suggest that only one option is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to determine which one is more likely.\n\nLet's think about the signs.\n\nIn option B: \u0394H > 0, \u0394S < 0.\n\nIn option C: \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0.\n\nGiven that at 298 K, \u0394G > 0, and at 220 K, \u0394G < 0.\n\nI need to see which one must be true.\n\nLet's consider the temperature dependence.\n\n\u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S.\n\nAt T = 298 K, \u0394G > 0.\n\nAt T = 220 K, \u0394G < 0.\n\nSo, there must be a temperature between 220 K and 298 K where \u0394G = 0.\n\nThat is, at some T_c, \u0394G = 0 \u21d2 \u0394H - T_c \u0394S = 0 \u21d2 T_c = \u0394H / \u0394S.\n\nNow, since \u0394G changes sign between 220 K and 298 K, T_c must be between these temperatures.\n\nSo, 220 K < T_c < 298 K.\n\nGiven that \u0394S < 0 in both options B and C, and \u0394H > 0 in B and \u0394H < 0 in C.\n\nFrom T_c = \u0394H / \u0394S, and since \u0394S < 0, \u0394H must have the opposite sign to make T_c positive.\n\nSo, if \u0394S < 0, then \u0394H must be positive to have T_c positive.\n\nWait, no: T_c = \u0394H / \u0394S.\n\nIf \u0394S < 0, then for T_c to be positive, \u0394H must be negative.\n\nWait, no: \u0394S is negative, so \u0394H must be negative to have T_c positive.\n\nWait, \u0394H / \u0394S, if \u0394S is negative, then \u0394H must be negative to have T_c positive.\n\nYes, that matches option C: \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0.\n\nIn option B: \u0394H > 0, \u0394S < 0, then T_c = \u0394H / \u0394S would be negative, which doesn't make sense because temperature can't be negative.\n\nWait, but temperatures are always positive in Kelvin scale.\n\nSo, if \u0394S < 0 and \u0394H > 0, T_c = \u0394H / \u0394S would be negative, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, option B cannot be correct because it would require a negative temperature, which doesn't exist.\n\nHence, the only possible option is C: \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0.\n\nIn this case, \u0394H < 0 and \u0394S < 0, so T_c = \u0394H / \u0394S is positive, and since \u0394H < 0 and \u0394S < 0, \u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S.\n\nAt high temperatures, T\u0394S is large (negative), so \u0394G could be positive.\n\nAt lower temperatures, T\u0394S is less negative, so \u0394G could become negative.\n\nTherefore, at 298 K, \u0394G > 0, and at 220 K, \u0394G < 0, which matches the observed behavior.\n\nThus, the correct answer is option C: \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G > 0 at 298 K, but the problem doesn't specify \u0394G > 0, it says the reaction is nonspontaneous at 298 K, which implies \u0394G > 0.\n\nSo, the final answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
