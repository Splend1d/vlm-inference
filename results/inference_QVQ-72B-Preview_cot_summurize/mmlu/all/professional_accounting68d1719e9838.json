                    "text": "So Bale Co. spent $100,000 on acquisition costs to buy Dixon Co.'s net assets. Now, I need to figure out how to account for this $100,000. The options are:\n\nA. Allocate it proportionally to the nonmonetary assets acquired.\n\nB. Capitalize it as part of goodwill and test it annually for impairment.\n\nC. Capitalize it as another asset and amortize it over five years.\n\nD. Expense it as soon as it's incurred in the current period.\n\nFirst, I should recall what acquisition costs are. Acquisition costs are expenses incurred to buy another company's assets or shares. In this case, it's about purchasing net assets of Dixon Co.\n\nNow, according to accounting standards, especially in business combinations, there are specific rules on how to treat these costs.\n\nLet me think about Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Both frameworks have rules on business combinations.\n\nIn a business combination, the acquirer has to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the identifiable net assets is goodwill.\n\nBut where do acquisition costs fit into this picture?\n\nI remember that under GAAP, specifically FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations, most acquisition-related costs are required to be expensed as incurred. However, there might be exceptions.\n\nSimilarly, under IFRS, IFRS 3 Business Combinations also generally requires that incremental costs to achieve a business combination be expensed.\n\nBut let's look more carefully.\n\nOption A suggests allocating the acquisition costs proportionally to the nonmonetary assets acquired. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Allocation on a pro rata basis would mean spreading the costs across the assets based on their relative fair values. But I don't recall that being the standard treatment for acquisition costs.\n\nOption B says to capitalize the acquisition costs as part of goodwill and test it annually for impairment. Goodwill is already the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets. Including acquisition costs in goodwill would mean adding an extra amount beyond that excess. I don't think that's allowed.\n\nOption C proposes capitalizing the acquisition costs as another asset and amortizing them over five years. Again, I don't recall any specific guidance that allows capitalizing acquisition costs as a separate asset. Amortization periods for intangible assets are typically based on their useful lives, which might not necessarily be five years.\n\nOption D suggests expensing the acquisition costs as incurred in the current period. This aligns with what I recall about GAAP and IFRS treatment of acquisition costs. They are considered period costs and are expensed in the period they are incurred.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider some exceptions.\n\nAre there any circumstances where acquisition costs might be capitalized? For example, if they are directly attributable to creating an intangible asset, perhaps. But in the context of a business combination, I think the general rule is to expense them.\n\nAlso, sometimes, legal costs or other direct costs associated with the acquisition might be capitalized as part of the cost of the asset acquired. But I think that's more common in asset acquisitions rather than business combinations.\n\nIn a business combination, the entire bundle of assets and liabilities is being acquired, and the acquisition costs are seen more as costs of the transaction rather than directly adding to the value of the assets acquired.\n\nMoreover, capitalizing acquisition costs could potentially inflate the carrying amounts of assets or goodwill, which might not reflect their true economic value.\n\nTherefore, expensing them as incurred seems to be the most appropriate treatment.\n\nLet me check some references to confirm this.\n\nLooking up FASB ASC 805-20-25-1, it states that \"Incremental direct costs of achieving a business combination that vary with and are essential to making the business combination successful shall be recognized in the period in which the costs are incurred.\"\n\nSimilarly, under IFRS 3.19, it says, \"Direct costs of effecting a business combination are expenses that are incremental to the combination and that would not have been incurred if the combination had not taken place. Such costs include, for example, fees paid to investment bankers, consultants, and attorneys.\"\n\nAnd IFRS 3.21 states that \"An acquirer recognizes and measures direct costs of effecting a business combination in profit or loss.\"\n\nSo, both GAAP and IFRS require that acquisition costs be expensed as incurred.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Expensed as incurred in the current period.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other perspective that might lead to a different conclusion.\n\nFor instance, perhaps in tax accounting, acquisition costs might be treated differently, but the question is about financial accounting under GAAP or IFRS.\n\nAlso, maybe in some industries, acquisition costs are capitalized, but I can't think of any off the top of my head.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the $100,000 includes costs that should be allocated to specific assets or liabilities. For example, if there were legal costs specifically related to transferring certain assets, maybe those could be capitalized with the assets.\n\nHowever, in the scenario presented, it's stated that these are acquisition costs related to the purchase of net assets of Dixon Co. It doesn't specify any direct association with a particular asset or liability, suggesting that they are general transaction costs.\n\nHence, the most appropriate treatment is to expense them in the period they were incurred.\n\nSo, my final answer is D. Expensed as incurred in the current period.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
