                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. I'm not super familiar with what was going on in 2020, but I'll try my best.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I made friends with the homely girl at school just so I could feel better about myself.\"\n\nHmm, okay. So, the person is saying they became friends with someone they consider \"homely,\" which I think means not particularly attractive or maybe plain-looking, just to boost their own self-esteem. That sounds a bit tricky. Like, they're using someone else for their own personal gain, which doesn't seem very nice.\n\nI remember learning that true friendship is supposed to be based on mutual respect and care, not on some ulterior motive. So, if someone is only being friends with someone to make themselves feel better, that might be seen as manipulative or insincere. That could be hurtful to the other person if they found out.\n\nBut, on the other hand, maybe the person didn't have bad intentions. Maybe they thought by being friends with someone who isn't as popular or conventionally attractive, they could help that person feel better too. Still, the primary motive seems to be self-serving.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If I were the \"homely girl,\" would I want someone to be friends with me just to make themselves feel better? Probably not. It feels like I'm being used for their benefit, rather than us forming a real connection.\n\nSo, based on that, I think Scenario 1 is morally wrong because it's based on insincere intentions and could potentially harm the other person emotionally.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I stayed home because I knew I had a fever.\"\n\nOkay, so the person had a fever and decided to stay home. I think staying home when you're sick is generally considered the right thing to do, especially considering things like not spreading illness to others.\n\nIn 2020, there was a big deal about COVID-19, which is a contagious virus. One of the symptoms is fever, and health officials were emphasizing the importance of staying home if you had symptoms like fever or cough to prevent spreading the disease.\n\nSo, in this context, staying home because you have a fever seems responsible and considerate of others.\n\nBut let's say, for argument's sake, that the person stayed home just to avoid work or school responsibilities. Even then, if they're sick, it's still generally seen as okay to prioritize their health and recover.\n\nUnless, of course, they're faking being sick to avoid something, but the scenario says they \"knew\" they had a fever, so presumably, they're actually sick.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 2 doesn't seem morally wrong. It seems like a responsible decision to stay home when you're sick, especially considering public health concerns.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Scenario 1 is morally wrong, and Scenario 2 is not morally wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nI think that's the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
