                    "text": "So I have this sentence: \"Every day was a happy day, and every night was peaceful.\" And I need to classify it as simple, compound, complex, or compound-complex. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means:\n\n- **Simple sentence:** This is a sentence with one independent clause and no dependent clauses. An independent clause can stand alone as a sentence because it expresses a complete thought.\n\n- **Compound sentence:** This is a sentence with two or more independent clauses connected by coordinating conjunctions like \"and,\" \"but,\" \"or,\" etc.\n\n- **Complex sentence:** This is a sentence with one independent clause and at least one dependent clause. A dependent clause cannot stand alone; it depends on the independent clause to make sense.\n\n- **Compound-complex sentence:** This is a sentence with two or more independent clauses and at least one dependent clause.\n\nAlright, so looking at the sentence: \"Every day was a happy day, and every night was peaceful.\"\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- \"Every day was a happy day\" \u2013 this seems like a complete thought. It has a subject (\"every day\") and a predicate (\"was a happy day\").\n\n- \"Every night was peaceful\" \u2013 similarly, this also expresses a complete thought with a subject (\"every night\") and a predicate (\"was peaceful\").\n\nSo, I have two independent clauses here:\n\n1. Every day was a happy day.\n\n2. Every night was peaceful.\n\nThese two clauses are connected by the coordinating conjunction \"and.\" So, this suggests that it's a compound sentence because I have two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that one of these clauses could be dependent? Let's check.\n\nIs \"every day was a happy day\" dependent on \"every night was peaceful\" in any way? No, they seem to be separate statements about different times of the day. Neither clause depends on the other for meaning.\n\nTherefore, it's a compound sentence.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's make sure there aren't any dependent clauses here.\n\nIs there any subordinate clause introduced by a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun? For example, if the sentence was something like \"Every day was a happy day because every night was peaceful,\" then \"because every night was peaceful\" would be a dependent clause, making the whole sentence complex.\n\nBut in this case, there's no subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun present. It's just two independent clauses connected by \"and.\"\n\nSo, I'm confident that this is a compound sentence.\n\nLet me double-check with an example of each type to reinforce my understanding.\n\n- **Simple sentence:** \"Every day was happy.\" That's just one independent clause.\n\n- **Compound sentence:** \"Every day was happy, and every night was peaceful.\" Which is exactly like the given sentence.\n\n- **Complex sentence:** \"Because every night was peaceful, every day was happy.\" Here, \"because every night was peaceful\" is a dependent clause, and \"every day was happy\" is the independent clause.\n\n- **Compound-complex sentence:** \"Every day was happy, and every night was peaceful, but sometimes they felt differently.\" Here, we have two independent clauses (\"every day was happy\" and \"every night was peaceful\") and one dependent clause (\"but sometimes they felt differently\").\n\nSo, comparing this to the given sentence, it's clear that \"Every day was a happy day, and every night was peaceful\" is a compound sentence.\n\nI think that's the correct classification.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. compound}} \\]"
