Let me first make sure I understand what sensory adaptation is.\n\nSensory adaptation is when our senses adjust to constant stimuli over time, right? Like, if something is constantly happening, our brain kind of gets used to it and doesn't pay as much attention anymore. It's a way for our nervous system to filter out unimportant information and focus on changes or new inputs that might be more relevant for survival or awareness.\n\nSo, with that in mind, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Enjoying a song the more you hear it.\n\nHmm, this seems different from sensory adaptation. This sounds more like developing a preference or liking for something with repeated exposure. It's more about emotional response or cognitive appreciation rather than the sensory system adapting to a constant stimulus.\n\nB. Responding immediately every time the fire alarm is sounded.\n\nThis seems like the opposite of sensory adaptation. If you always respond immediately to the fire alarm, it means that you haven't gotten used to it or ignored it over time. Sensory adaptation would be if you stopped noticing or responding to the alarm after hearing it repeatedly.\n\nC. Not realizing how cold the pool is after you've been under the water for a few minutes.\n\nThis sounds like a classic example of sensory adaptation. When you first get into a cold pool, your senses are shocked by the temperature, but over time, your body adjusts, and you don't feel it as strongly. So, the sensation of coldness diminishes even though the temperature of the water remains the same.\n\nD. Relying heavily on your hearing when walking down a dark corridor.\n\nThis seems more like sensory substitution or enhanced awareness due to the absence of another sense. In a dark environment, your visual senses aren't providing much information, so your hearing might become more acute or more relied upon to detect potential hazards or changes in the environment. It's not necessarily adaptation to a constant stimulus but rather a shift in sensory focus.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C seems to be the best example of sensory adaptation. It directly illustrates how our senses adjust to a constant stimulus (the temperature of the water) over time, leading to a decrease in the perception of that stimulus.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check the other options:\n\nA. Again, this is more about developing a preference through repetition, not about sensory adaptation.\n\nB. This is actually the opposite of adaptation; it's about maintaining a response despite repeated exposure.\n\nD. This is about shifting sensory focus in response to environmental conditions, not about adapting to a constant stimulus.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Not realizing how cold the pool is after you are under the water for a few minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
