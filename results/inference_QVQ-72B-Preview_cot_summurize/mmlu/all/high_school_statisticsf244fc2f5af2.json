                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"The probability is 0.2 that a value selected at random from a normal distribution with mean 600 and standard deviation 15 will be above what number?\" And the options are A. 0.84, B. 603.8, C. 612.6, and D. 587.4.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a normal distribution with a mean (\u03bc) of 600 and a standard deviation (\u03c3) of 15. We're looking for a value such that the probability of selecting a value above this number is 0.2.\n\nSo, in probability terms, we're looking for a value 'x' such that P(X > x) = 0.2.\n\nSince the distribution is normal, I can use the properties of the normal distribution to find this value.\n\nI know that for a normal distribution, the probability density function is symmetric around the mean. So, if I standardize the variable X by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation, I can use the standard normal distribution table (Z-table) to find the corresponding Z-score.\n\nSo, let's define Z = (X - \u03bc)/\u03c3 = (X - 600)/15.\n\nNow, P(X > x) = P(Z > (x - 600)/15) = 0.2.\n\nBut standard normal tables typically give us P(Z < z), which is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) up to a certain Z-value.\n\nSo, P(Z > z) = 1 - P(Z < z) = 0.2.\n\nTherefore, P(Z < z) = 0.8.\n\nSo, I need to find the Z-score where the cumulative probability is 0.8.\n\nLooking at the standard normal table, I need to find z such that P(Z < z) = 0.8.\n\nFrom the table, I find that z is approximately 0.84.\n\nWait, but the options include 0.84, but that can't be the answer because 0.84 is a Z-score, not the actual value of X we're looking for.\n\nSo, I need to find x such that (x - 600)/15 = 0.84.\n\nLet me solve for x:\n\n(x - 600)/15 = 0.84\n\nx - 600 = 0.84 * 15\n\nx - 600 = 12.6\n\nx = 600 + 12.6 = 612.6\n\nSo, x is approximately 612.6.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 612.6 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider whether the Z-score should be positive or negative.\n\nSince P(X > x) = 0.2, and the distribution is symmetric, the area to the right of x is 0.2, which corresponds to the upper tail of the distribution.\n\nSo, yes, Z should be positive, as I have it.\n\nAlternatively, if I had considered P(X < x) = 0.8, then Z would still be positive.\n\nWait, let me make sure about the Z-score.\n\nIn standard normal tables, P(Z < z) = 0.8 corresponds to z = 0.84, as you typically look up the closest value in the table.\n\nBut to be precise, let's recall that the Z-score for the 80th percentile (since P(Z < z) = 0.8) is indeed approximately 0.84.\n\nSo, x = \u03bc + z * \u03c3 = 600 + 0.84 * 15 = 600 + 12.6 = 612.6.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 612.6.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the inverse cumulative distribution function.\n\nIn Python or with a calculator, I could use the inverse normal function with mean 600 and standard deviation 15, and find the value where the upper tail probability is 0.2.\n\nThat should give me the same result.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the empirical rule, which states that about 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation, 95% within two, and 99.7% within three standard deviations.\n\nBut since we're dealing with a specific probability of 0.2, which isn't directly covered by the empirical rule, it's better to use the Z-table or the inverse normal function.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is C. 612.6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
