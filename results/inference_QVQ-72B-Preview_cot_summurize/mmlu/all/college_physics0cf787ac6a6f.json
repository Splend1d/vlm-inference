                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a particle moving in a circle with a 10-meter radius. At a certain instant, its speed is 10 meters per second, and it's accelerating at 10 meters per second squared. I need to find the angle between the particle's velocity and acceleration vectors.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how circular motion works. When a particle moves in a circle, there are two main components to its acceleration: the centripetal acceleration, which is always\u6307\u5411\u5706\u5fc3, and the tangential acceleration, which is along the direction of motion, affecting the particle's speed.\n\nThe centripetal acceleration is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ a_c = \\frac{v^2}{r} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( v \\) is the speed of the particle,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle.\n\nGiven that the speed is increasing, there must also be a tangential acceleration component, which is responsible for this increase in speed. The tangential acceleration is given directly as the rate at which the speed is changing, which in this case is 10 meters per second squared.\n\nSo, the total acceleration of the particle is the vector sum of the centripetal and tangential accelerations.\n\nI need to find the angle between the velocity vector and the total acceleration vector.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the centripetal and tangential accelerations.\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\( v = 10 \\) m/s,\n\n- \\( r = 10 \\) m,\n\n- tangential acceleration \\( a_t = 10 \\) m/s\u00b2.\n\nSo, the centripetal acceleration is:\n\n\\[ a_c = \\frac{v^2}{r} = \\frac{(10)^2}{10} = \\frac{100}{10} = 10 \\) m/s\u00b2.\n\nNow, the total acceleration \\( a \\) is the vector sum of \\( a_c \\) and \\( a_t \\).\n\nSince \\( a_c \\) is perpendicular to the velocity (pointing towards the center), and \\( a_t \\) is parallel to the velocity (since the speed is increasing), the total acceleration vector forms a right triangle with \\( a_c \\) and \\( a_t \\) as its perpendicular sides.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the total acceleration \\( a \\) is:\n\n\\[ a = \\sqrt{a_c^2 + a_t^2} = \\sqrt{10^2 + 10^2} = \\sqrt{100 + 100} = \\sqrt{200} = 10\\sqrt{2} \\) m/s\u00b2.\n\nNow, the angle \\( \\theta \\) between the velocity and the total acceleration can be found using the dot product formula:\n\n\\[ \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{a} = |\\vec{v}| |\\vec{a}| \\cos \\theta \\]\n\nBut since the velocity is only in the tangential direction, and the acceleration has both centripetal and tangential components, I need to express the acceleration vector in terms of its components.\n\nAlternatively, since \\( a_t \\) is parallel to \\( v \\) and \\( a_c \\) is perpendicular to \\( v \\), the total acceleration can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\vec{a} = a_t \\hat{t} + a_c \\hat{n} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\hat{t} \\) is the unit tangent vector (direction of velocity), and \\( \\hat{n} \\) is the unit normal vector (direction towards the center).\n\nThe dot product \\( \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{a} \\) is then:\n\n\\[ \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{a} = v a_t \\]\n\nbecause \\( v \\) is along \\( \\hat{t} \\), and \\( a_t \\) is also along \\( \\hat{t} \\), while \\( a_c \\) is perpendicular.\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{a} = v a_t \\]\n\nNow, the magnitude of \\( \\vec{v} \\) is \\( v \\), and the magnitude of \\( \\vec{a} \\) is \\( \\sqrt{a_t^2 + a_c^2} = \\sqrt{10^2 + 10^2} = \\sqrt{200} = 10\\sqrt{2} \\) m/s\u00b2.\n\nSo, the dot product formula becomes:\n\n\\[ v a_t = v \\cdot a \\cos \\theta \\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( v \\):\n\n\\[ a_t = a \\cos \\theta \\]\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n\\[ 10 = 10\\sqrt{2} \\cos \\theta \\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\cos \\theta \\):\n\n\\[ \\cos \\theta = \\frac{10}{10\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ \\theta = \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = 45^\\circ \\]\n\nSo, the angle between the particle's velocity and acceleration vectors is 45 degrees.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0\u00b0\n\nB. 30\u00b0\n\nC. 45\u00b0\n\nD. 60\u00b0\n\nThe correct answer is C. 45\u00b0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45^\\circ} \\]"
