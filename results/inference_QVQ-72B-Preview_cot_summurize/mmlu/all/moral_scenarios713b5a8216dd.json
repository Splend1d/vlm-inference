                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I called 911 and reported that my neighbor was screaming for help at her home.\n\nScenario 2: The military submarine interior had a small hole in it that water was coming through, so I went to bed after quickly putting a band-aid over it.\n\nAnd the question is asking for which of these scenarios the main character does something clearly morally wrong.\n\nOkay, so let's consider Scenario 1 first. Calling 911 to report that a neighbor is screaming for help seems like the right thing to do, right? If someone is screaming for help, it's probably because they're in danger or need assistance. So, reporting that to emergency services is generally considered the responsible action to take. I don't see anything morally wrong with that. In fact, it's more about helping someone in need.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe the person wasn't actually in need of help, and it was a false alarm. But the scenario says that the neighbor was screaming for help, so assuming that's true, reporting it is the right thing to do.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2. There's a military submarine with a small hole in it, and water is coming through. The main character puts a band-aid over it and then goes to bed. Hmm, this seems more problematic.\n\nFirst off, a band-aid is not designed to seal holes in submarines. Submarines are high-pressure environments, and even small holes can lead to serious flooding, which could compromise the safety of the entire vessel and everyone on board. So, putting a band-aid over it is likely insufficient and could be seen as a reckless action.\n\nMoreover, going to bed after just putting a band-aid over a hole in a submarine seems irresponsible. The person should have reported the issue to the appropriate authorities or engineers on board to ensure that the hole is properly repaired. Ignoring a potential danger like that could lead to catastrophic consequences.\n\nSo, in this context, it seems that in Scenario 2, the main character is acting in a way that is clearly morally wrong because they are neglecting their duty to ensure the safety of others by not taking appropriate action to fix a potentially dangerous situation.\n\nComparing both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Calling 911 to report a neighbor screaming for help is morally right.\n\n- Scenario 2: Putting a band-aid over a hole in a submarine and going to bed without taking proper action is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong\" for Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, respectively.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nIn Scenario 1, is there any way that calling 911 could be considered wrong? Well, if it was a false report or if the person was doing it maliciously, but the scenario doesn't indicate that. It seems like a genuine attempt to help someone in distress.\n\nIn Scenario 2, is there any context that might make putting a band-aid over the hole acceptable? For example, if the person was under extreme time pressure and didn't have access to better tools, but even then, it's unlikely that a band-aid would be an adequate solution. They should have at least tried to find a better temporary fix or alerted someone who could handle the situation properly.\n\nSo, after considering both scenarios carefully, I'm confident that Scenario 1 is \"Not wrong,\" and Scenario 2 is \"Wrong.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
