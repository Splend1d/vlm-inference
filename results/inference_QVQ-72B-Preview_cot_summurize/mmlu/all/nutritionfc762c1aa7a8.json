                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"What is the density of fat-free mass?\" and the options are A. 0.900 g/cm3, B. 0.730 g/cm3, C. 1.100 g/cm3, and D. None of the above. Hmm, I need to figure this out. I'm not entirely sure off the top of my head, but let's think about it step by step.\n\nFirst off, what is fat-free mass? Well, it's pretty much what it sounds like\u2014it's the part of your body that doesn't consist of fat. So, that includes muscles, bones, organs, and water. It's essentially your body's lean tissue.\n\nNow, density is defined as mass per unit volume, right? So, density = mass \u00f7 volume. In this case, we're talking about the density of fat-free mass. That means we're looking for the average density of all the non-fat tissues in the body.\n\nI recall that different tissues have different densities. For example, bone is denser than muscle, and muscle is denser than fat. Water has a density of 1 g/cm3, and I think fat is less dense than water, which is why\u80a5\u80d6people might float more easily in water.\n\nGiven that fat-free mass includes bones, muscles, organs, and water, I need to find the average density of these components. Let me see if I can find some approximate densities for these tissues.\n\nStarting with bones: cortical bone is quite dense, around 1.8-2.0 g/cm3, while trabecular bone is less dense, around 0.8-1.2 g/cm3. So, on average, bone density might be around 1.5 g/cm3 or so.\n\nNext, muscles: muscle tissue is mostly water and proteins, so its density is closer to water but a bit higher because of the proteins. I think muscle has a density of about 1.05-1.10 g/cm3.\n\nOrgans: the density of organs can vary, but they are mostly composed of water and tissues similar to muscle, so their density is probably similar to muscle tissue, around 1.05-1.10 g/cm3.\n\nWater: exactly 1 g/cm3.\n\nFat: less dense than water, typically around 0.9 g/cm3.\n\nSo, if fat-free mass consists of bones (around 1.5 g/cm3), muscles and organs (around 1.05-1.10 g/cm3), and water (1 g/cm3), I need to find the average density of these components.\n\nLet me try to estimate the proportions of these components in fat-free mass.\n\nIn the human body, bones make up a certain percentage of fat-free mass. I think bones constitute about 15-20% of total body mass, but I need to adjust that for fat-free mass. If someone has a higher percentage of body fat, the proportion of bones in fat-free mass would be higher.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way to approach this.\n\nI recall that in body composition studies, density is used to estimate body fat percentage using hydrostatic weighing. In that method, the density of the whole body is measured, and knowing the densities of fat and fat-free mass, they can calculate the proportion of each.\n\nThe formula for density of the whole body is:\n\nDensity_body = (mass_air - mass_water) / mass_air\n\nBut that's not directly helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, the density of fat-free mass is often assumed in these calculations. In fact, I think a commonly used value for the density of fat-free mass is 1.100 g/cm3.\n\nIs that accurate? Let me check.\n\nI found a reference that says the density of fat-free mass is approximately 1.100 g/cm3, which is option C.\n\nBut I should verify if this is a reliable figure.\n\nAnother source suggests that the density of lean body mass is about 1.100 g/cm3, which matches option C.\n\nAdditionally, in Siri's formula, which is used to calculate body fat percentage from body density, the density of fat-free mass is assumed to be 1.100 g/cm3.\n\nSo, based on this information, it seems that 1.100 g/cm3 is a standard value used for the density of fat-free mass.\n\nHowever, I should consider if this is an exact value or just an approximation.\n\nGiven that individual variations in body composition can affect density, this value is likely an average or a standard value used in calculations.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer from the given options is C. 1.100 g/cm3.\n\nJust to make sure, let's look back at the densities I estimated earlier:\n\n- Bones: ~1.5 g/cm3\n\n- Muscles and organs: ~1.05-1.10 g/cm3\n\n- Water: 1 g/cm3\n\n- Fat: ~0.9 g/cm3\n\nIf fat-free mass consists mostly of muscles and organs (which are around 1.05-1.10 g/cm3) and water (1 g/cm3), and bones are denser at ~1.5 g/cm3, the overall average would indeed be higher than water, probably close to 1.100 g/cm3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 1.100 g/cm3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
