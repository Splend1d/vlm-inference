                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about two different scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are whether both are wrong, only one is wrong, or neither is wrong. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. In Scenario 1, someone tore out a page from a library book that they needed for their report and then returned the book to the shelf. In Scenario 2, there's a loud party next door, and the person had to drown the partygoers. Wait, that sounds a bit unclear. I think it might mean that the person had to do something to the partygoers to make the noise stop, maybe like covering their mouths or something, but that seems a bit extreme. Maybe it's a metaphorical way of saying they had to quiet down the party somehow. Anyway, I need to interpret this correctly.\n\nLet me start by looking at Scenario 1. Tearing out a page from a library book and returning the book to the shelf. That seems pretty straightforward. Libraries are public places where books are lent out for others to use, and it's important to take care of them so that everyone can benefit. Tearing out a page is like damaging the book, which is generally considered wrong because it affects other people who might want to use that book in the future. Plus, it's against library rules, which are there to ensure that resources are preserved and respected by all users. So, in this case, it seems like the person did something morally wrong by damaging a public property and disregarding the rules set in place for the community's benefit.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2. The party next door is loud, and the person had to \"drown the partygoers.\" This phrasing is a bit ambiguous. If taken literally, drowning someone would be a severe act of violence, which is undoubtedly morally wrong. However, I suspect that \"drown the partygoers\" is a figurative expression, meaning that the person had to find a way to quiet down the party or reduce the noise in some manner. Perhaps they played their own music to drown out the party noise, or maybe they did something else to mitigate the disturbance.\n\nBut to answer the question accurately, I need to consider what the phrase \"drown the partygoers\" might reasonably be interpreted to mean. In common usage, \"drowning out\" noise typically refers to masking or overpowering one noise with another, louder noise. So, if the person played their own music very loudly to block out the party noise, that would be a more plausible interpretation.\n\nHowever, this could still be problematic because playing loud music in response to loud noise might disturb other neighbors and could escalate the situation. But is this action morally wrong? Well, it depends on the context and the intentions behind the action.\n\nLet me consider the intentions. If the person's goal was to reduce the impact of the party noise on their own peace and quiet, perhaps in self-defense or to protect their ability to rest or work, then their actions might be seen as a reaction to the initial disturbance caused by the party. On the other hand, if their intention was to deliberately annoy the partygoers or cause them distress, that would be more morally questionable.\n\nBut since the scenario is phrased as \"I had to drown the partygoers,\" it suggests that the person felt compelled to take action due to the noise, possibly in a moment of frustration. Without more context, it's hard to judge the morality of the action fully.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 seems clearly morally wrong because damaging a library book is both against the law and against social norms of respecting public property. In Scenario 2, depending on how \"drowning the partygoers\" is interpreted, it could be seen as either a morally neutral action taken in self-defense or a morally wrong act of retaliation.\n\nGiven that, I need to choose between the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, Scenario 1 is clearly wrong, while Scenario 2 is more ambiguous. However, if \"drowning the partygoers\" is interpreted as a figurative way of dealing with the noise, it might not be necessarily morally wrong, depending on the methods used.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer seems to be B. Wrong, Not wrong, meaning that Scenario 1 is morally wrong, but Scenario 2 is not necessarily so.\n\nBut I should double-check this. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's see.\n\nIn Scenario 1, tearing out a page from a library book is definitely wrong. It's vandalism and goes against the principles of caring for shared resources. In Scenario 2, if \"drowning the partygoers\" means harming them physically, that's clearly wrong. But I think it's more likely a figurative expression, meaning the person did something to counteract the noise, perhaps by playing their own music loudly or taking some other measure to mitigate the disturbance.\n\nIf that's the case, then it's not necessarily morally wrong, depending on the specifics. For example, if the person played music at a reasonable volume to mask the noise, that might be seen as a harmless way to cope with the situation. Alternatively, if they took steps to quiet the party, like asking the hosts to turn down the music or calling the police, those actions would generally be considered appropriate and not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, based on this interpretation, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether there's any scenario where \"drowning the partygoers\" could be interpreted as morally wrong. For instance, if the person took aggressive action against the partygoers, like throwing water balloons at them or something similarly disruptive, that could be seen as morally wrong due to the potential for causing harm or escalating the conflict.\n\nBut the phrase \"drown the partygoers\" suggests more of a passive approach, like drowning out the noise, rather than actively harming the partygoers. So, unless there's clear intent to harm, which isn't indicated in the scenario, I don't think it's morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
