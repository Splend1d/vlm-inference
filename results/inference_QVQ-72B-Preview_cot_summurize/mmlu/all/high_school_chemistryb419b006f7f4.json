                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"The weight percent of sodium hydroxide dissolved in water is 50%. What is the mole fraction of sodium hydroxide?\" And the options are A. 31.00%, B. 0.164, C. 0.311, and D. 0.5.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. I know that weight percent is a way to express the concentration of a solution. It tells me how much mass of solute is in a certain mass of solution. So, if the weight percent is 50%, that means that for every 100 grams of solution, there are 50 grams of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 50 grams of water (H\u2082O).\n\nBut the question is asking for the mole fraction, not the weight percent. Mole fraction is a different way to express concentration, and it's based on the number of moles of each component rather than their masses. The formula for mole fraction (X) of a substance is:\n\n\\[ X = \\frac{\\text{moles of the substance}}{\\text{total moles of all components}} \\]\n\nSo, to find the mole fraction of NaOH, I need to know how many moles of NaOH are present and divide that by the total moles of NaOH and water combined.\n\nAlright, step one is to calculate the moles of NaOH in 50 grams. I need the molar mass of NaOH for that. Let's see, the molar mass of NaOH is:\n\n- Sodium (Na): approximately 23 g/mol\n\n- Oxygen (O): approximately 16 g/mol\n\n- Hydrogen (H): approximately 1 g/mol\n\nSo, 23 + 16 + 1 = 40 g/mol.\n\nTherefore, the moles of NaOH in 50 grams are:\n\n\\[ \\text{moles of NaOH} = \\frac{50 \\text{ g}}{40 \\text{ g/mol}} = 1.25 \\text{ moles} \\]\n\nNext, I need to find out how many moles are in 50 grams of water. The molar mass of water (H\u2082O) is:\n\n- Hydrogen (H): 1 g/mol each, so 2 g/mol\n\n- Oxygen (O): 16 g/mol\n\nTotal: 2 + 16 = 18 g/mol.\n\nSo, moles of water in 50 grams are:\n\n\\[ \\text{moles of H\u2082O} = \\frac{50 \\text{ g}}{18 \\text{ g/mol}} \\approx 2.78 \\text{ moles} \\]\n\nNow, the total moles in the solution are:\n\n\\[ \\text{total moles} = 1.25 + 2.78 \\approx 4.03 \\text{ moles} \\]\n\nFinally, the mole fraction of NaOH is:\n\n\\[ X_{\\text{NaOH}} = \\frac{1.25}{4.03} \\approx 0.310 \\]\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 31.00%\n\nB. 0.164\n\nC. 0.311\n\nD. 0.5\n\nSo, 0.310 is approximately 31.00%, which is option A, or 0.311, which is option C. But since the question asks for the mole fraction, which is a unitless ratio, 0.310 is closer to 0.311, which is option C.\n\nWait a minute, option A is 31.00%, which seems like it might be the mole fraction expressed as a percentage, but that's not standard. Mole fraction is typically expressed as a decimal or fraction, not as a percentage. So, option C seems more appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question has a typo, and option A was intended to be 0.310 instead of 31.00%. But as it is, the correct answer should be approximately 0.310, which is closest to option C. 0.311.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nGiven:\n\n- 50% weight percent NaOH in water\n\n- Molar mass NaOH: 40 g/mol\n\n- Molar mass H\u2082O: 18 g/mol\n\n- Moles NaOH: 50 g / 40 g/mol = 1.25 moles\n\n- Moles H\u2082O: 50 g / 18 g/mol \u2248 2.78 moles\n\n- Total moles: 1.25 + 2.78 = 4.03 moles\n\n- Mole fraction NaOH: 1.25 / 4.03 \u2248 0.310 or 31.0%\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might think in terms of moles per liter, but since we're dealing with mole fraction, which is just a ratio of moles, I think this approach is correct.\n\nSo, my final answer is approximately 0.310, which corresponds to option C. 0.311.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
