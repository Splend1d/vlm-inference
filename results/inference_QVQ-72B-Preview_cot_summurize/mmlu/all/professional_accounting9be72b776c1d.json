The options are:\n\nA. Fund financial statement.\n\nB. Combining nonmajor fund statement.\n\nC. Notes to the financial statements.\n\nD. Management discussion and analysis.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what required supplementary information (RSI) is in the context of local government financial reporting. I recall that RSI is information that's necessary to provide a full picture of the government's financial position and operations, but it's not included in the basic financial statements themselves.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Fund financial statement.\n\nI know that fund financial statements are a key part of the basic financial statements for a local government. They present the financial position and operations of the government's various funds, like the general fund, special revenue funds, capital projects funds, debt service funds, and permanent funds. Since these are part of the basic financial statements, I don't think they're considered supplementary information. Supplementary information is usually additional to the basic statements.\n\nOption B: Combining nonmajor fund statement.\n\nI'm a bit fuzzy on this one. I remember that local governments have many funds, and they're required to report major funds separately in the fund financial statements. Nonmajor funds are those that don't meet the significance criteria to be considered major. For these nonmajor funds, instead of presenting individual fund financial statements, they can be combined into a single statement called a combining statement.\n\nNow, where does this fit in? Is it part of the basic financial statements or is it supplementary information?\n\nI think combining statements for nonmajor funds are part of the basic financial statements. They provide a consolidated view of the smaller funds and are necessary to understand the full financial picture of the government. So, probably, they're not considered supplementary information.\n\nBut let me double-check that.\n\nOption C: Notes to the financial statements.\n\nAgain, I think of the notes as an integral part of the basic financial statements. They provide details and explanations for the numbers presented in the statements themselves. Without the notes, the statements wouldn't be complete. So, notes are part of the basic financial statements, not supplementary information.\n\nOption D: Management discussion and analysis.\n\nThis sounds promising. I recall that the management discussion and analysis (MD&A) is a section in local government financial reports where management provides their perspective on the financial condition and operations of the government. It's often used to give context and explanation beyond what's presented in the basic financial statements.\n\nGiven that, it seems like MD&A is supplementary information, providing additional insights and analysis that aren't part of the basic statements themselves.\n\nWait a minute, but is it required supplementary information?\n\nI think so. I believe that GASB (Governmental Accounting Standards Board) requires MD&A as part of the required supplementary information for local governments.\n\nLet me see if I can recall the specific requirements for RSI in local government financial reporting.\n\nRSI typically includes things like:\n\n- MD&A\n\n- Required supplementary schedules\n\n- Information about infrastructure assets\n\n- Pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) information\n\n- Budgetary comparison schedules\n\nBut I might be missing some.\n\nGiven that, MD&A seems to be a key component of RSI.\n\nLet me consider if any of the other options could also be considered RSI.\n\nFund financial statements (Option A) are part of the basic financial statements, not RSI.\n\nCombining nonmajor fund statements (Option B) are also part of the basic financial statements.\n\nNotes to the financial statements (Option C) are part of the basic financial statements as well.\n\nSo, by elimination, Option D: Management discussion and analysis seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut I want to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nI think it's important to remember that RSI is information that's not part of the basic financial statements but is still required to be disclosed in the financial report to provide a full understanding of the government's financial position and operations.\n\nMD&A fits this description perfectly. It's where management discusses the government's financial trends, significant events, and other relevant information that isn't captured in the numbers alone.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that Option D is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly summarize why the other options are not considered RSI:\n\nA. Fund financial statements are part of the basic financial statements.\n\nB. Combining nonmajor fund statements are also part of the basic financial statements.\n\nC. Notes to the financial statements are integral to the basic financial statements.\n\nD. Management discussion and analysis is supplementary information provided by management, making it RSI.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Management discussion and analysis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
