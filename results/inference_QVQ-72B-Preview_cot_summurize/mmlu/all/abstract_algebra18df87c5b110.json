                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out these two statements about group homomorphisms. I'm not super confident with group theory yet, so I want to make sure I understand this correctly.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: \"A homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel consists of the identity element alone.\"\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to recall what a homomorphism is. A homomorphism between two groups is a function that preserves the group operation. Like, if you have groups G and H, and a function f from G to H, then for any two elements a and b in G, f(a * b) = f(a) * f(b), where * is the group operation.\n\nNow, one-to-one means that each element in G maps to a unique element in H, and no two different elements in G map to the same element in H. So, basically, f is injective.\n\nThe kernel of a homomorphism f is the set of elements in G that map to the identity element of H. So, ker(f) = {g in G | f(g) = e_H}, where e_H is the identity in H.\n\nStatement 1 is saying that f is one-to-one if and only if ker(f) contains only the identity element of G, which is e_G.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Because in some groups, the identity element maps to the identity element, but maybe there are other elements that also map to the identity.\n\nBut I think that in a homomorphism, the kernel is a subgroup of G, and if the kernel is trivial, meaning it only contains the identity element, then the homomorphism is one-to-one.\n\nLet me think about this. Suppose ker(f) contains only e_G. Then, if f(a) = f(b), then f(a) * f(b)^-1 = e_H, which is f(a * b^-1) = e_H. Since ker(f) only contains e_G, a * b^-1 must be e_G, so a = b. Therefore, f is one-to-one.\n\nConversely, if f is one-to-one, then ker(f) contains only e_G. Because if there were some g \u2260 e_G in ker(f), then f(g) = e_H, but since f is one-to-one, the only thing that maps to e_H is e_G.\n\nSo, yes, Statement 1 seems to be true.\n\nNow, Statement 2: \"The image of a group of 6 elements under some homomorphism may have 4 elements.\"\n\nHmm, okay. So, we have a group G with 6 elements, and a homomorphism f from G to some group H. The image of f is the set of elements in H that are f(g) for some g in G.\n\nNow, the question is whether the image can have 4 elements.\n\nI recall that for any homomorphism, the order of the image divides the order of the group G.\n\nWait, is that right? Let's see.\n\nActually, I think there's a theorem that says that the order of the image of a homomorphism is equal to the index of the kernel of the homomorphism in G.\n\nSpecifically, the First Isomorphism Theorem says that G/ker(f) is isomorphic to im(f), and the order of G/ker(f) is |G| / |ker(f)|.\n\nSo, |im(f)| = |G| / |ker(f)|.\n\nGiven that, if G has 6 elements, then |im(f)| = 6 / |ker(f)|.\n\nNow, |ker(f)| must be a divisor of 6, because kernels are subgroups.\n\nThe divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\nSo, |ker(f)| can be 1, 2, 3, or 6.\n\nCorrespondingly, |im(f)| can be 6, 3, 2, or 1.\n\nBut Statement 2 suggests that the image could have 4 elements, which is not a divisor of 6.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible for the image to have 4 elements under any homomorphism from a group of order 6.\n\nSo, Statement 2 is false.\n\nWait, but maybe there's some exception or something I'm missing.\n\nLet me think about a specific example.\n\nSuppose G is the cyclic group of order 6, say G = <a> with a^6 = e.\n\nLet's say H is some group, and f is a homomorphism from G to H.\n\nIf f(a) has order 1, then im(f) has 1 element.\n\nIf f(a) has order 2, then im(f) has 2 elements.\n\nIf f(a) has order 3, then im(f) has 3 elements.\n\nIf f(a) has order 6, then im(f) has 6 elements.\n\nBut there's no way to get 4 elements in the image, because 4 doesn't divide 6.\n\nSimilarly, if G is the symmetric group S_3, which also has order 6, the possible image sizes are again divisors of 6.\n\nSo, yeah, I don't see a way for the image to have 4 elements.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nStatement 1: True\n\nStatement 2: False\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
