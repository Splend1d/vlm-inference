                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about genetic variation, and I need to pick the true statement. Okay, so genetic variation is like the diversity of genes in a population, right? That's important because it's the raw material for evolution, especially natural selection. So, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: It is created by the direct action of natural selection. Hmm, I thought natural selection acts on existing variation, not necessarily creating the variation itself. Like, if there's a variation in beak size among birds, natural selection might favor larger beaks if there's a drought because they can crack tougher seeds better. But the variation in beak sizes was already there before the drought, right? So, maybe this isn't correct.\n\nOption B: It arises in response to changes in the environment. I've heard of this idea before, but I think it's more of a Lamarckian view. Lamarck thought that organisms could pass on acquired characteristics to their offspring, like giraffes stretching their necks to reach leaves and then their offspring having longer necks. But that's not how it works. Genetic variation is more about random mutations and recombination, not direct responses to the environment. So, probably not the right answer.\n\nOption C: It must be present in a population before natural selection can act upon the population. This seems to make sense. Natural selection can't do anything if there's no variation to select from. It's like, if all individuals in a population are identical, there's no difference for natural selection to act upon. So, having variation is necessary for natural selection to occur. This sounds plausible.\n\nOption D: It tends to be reduced by the processes involved when diploid organisms produce gametes. Wait, diploid organisms producing gametes involves meiosis, right? And meiosis is known for increasing genetic variation through crossing over and independent assortment. So, this seems contradictory. If meiosis increases variation, then how can it reduce genetic variation? Maybe this is talking about something else, but I think it's incorrect based on what I know about meiosis.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option C seems to be the correct statement about genetic variation: it must be present in a population before natural selection can act upon the population.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
