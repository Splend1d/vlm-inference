The options are:\n\nA. will make no use of pleasure or pain as sanctions.\n\nB. will be based entirely on the use of pleasure and pain as sanctions.\n\nC. will produce someone who does the right thing out of deference to authority.\n\nD. will produce someone who does the right thing simply because it is right.\n\nAnd the question is, according to Feinberg, which one of these is true for a good moral education.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Feinberg believes about moral education. I'm not super familiar with his work, but I think he was a philosopher who wrote about ethics and moral responsibility.\n\nLet me start by breaking down each option.\n\nOption A says that a good moral education will make no use of pleasure or pain as sanctions. So, basically, it's saying that rewarding good behavior or punishing bad behavior isn't part of moral education. But that seems a bit extreme. I mean, in many educational approaches, there are incentives for good behavior, like praise or rewards, and consequences for bad behavior, like punishments or disciplinary actions. So, if Feinberg thought that none of that should be used in moral education, that would be interesting.\n\nOption B says the opposite: that moral education should be based entirely on the use of pleasure and pain as sanctions. So, basically, rewarding good behavior and punishing bad behavior are the only tools used in moral education. This seems like a very behaviorist approach, where the goal is to shape behavior through rewards and punishments without necessarily teaching the underlying reasons why certain actions are right or wrong.\n\nOption C says that moral education will produce someone who does the right thing out of deference to authority. So, in this case, the person is following moral rules not because they understand or agree with them, but because an authority figure told them to do so. This could be seen in children who obey their parents or teachers just because those figures are in authority, not necessarily because they understand the moral principles behind the rules.\n\nOption D says that moral education will produce someone who does the right thing simply because it is right. This seems to suggest that the person has internalized moral principles and acts morally out of a sense of duty or because they believe it's the right thing to do, not just to avoid punishment or gain rewards.\n\nNow, I need to think about which of these aligns with Feinberg's views. I recall that Feinberg was interested in moral responsibility and the development of moral agency. He probably valued autonomous moral decision-making, where individuals act morally because they understand and agree with the moral principles involved, not just because they're being rewarded or punished.\n\nGiven that, option D seems the most plausible. It suggests that moral education should aim to produce individuals who do the right thing because they recognize it as such, not for external incentives or out of blind obedience to authority.\n\nBut let me consider each option more carefully.\n\nOption A: no use of pleasure or pain as sanctions. While it's possible that Feinberg might have emphasized the importance of internal moral reasoning over external rewards and punishments, completely eschewing any kind of sanctions seems unlikely. Most educational systems use some form of positive reinforcement or consequences to encourage desired behaviors.\n\nOption B: based entirely on pleasure and pain as sanctions. This seems too simplistic and behaviorist for a philosopher like Feinberg. While rewards and punishments might influence behavior in the short term, they might not foster a deep understanding of moral principles or encourage autonomous moral reasoning.\n\nOption C: doing the right thing out of deference to authority. This seems aligned with a more authoritarian approach to moral education, where obedience to rules is valued over critical thinking or understanding the reasons behind the rules. Feinberg, who emphasized moral responsibility and autonomy, would likely not support this view.\n\nOption D: doing the right thing simply because it is right. This aligns well with the idea of moral agency, where individuals act morally based on their own understanding and commitment to moral principles. Feinberg's work on moral responsibility suggests that he valued this kind of autonomous moral decision-making.\n\nAdditionally, I recall that Feinberg discussed the concept of moral education in his work on moral responsibility. He might have argued that true moral agency requires more than just following rules to avoid punishment or please authority figures. Instead, it involves developing the capacity to understand and apply moral principles independently.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, I would say that option D is the correct answer according to Feinberg. A good moral education, in his view, would produce someone who does the right thing simply because it is right, not because of external incentives or authority pressures.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check if there's any specific text or quote from Feinberg that directly supports this conclusion. Unfortunately, I don't have his exact writings in front of me right now, but from what I recall, his emphasis on moral responsibility and autonomy suggests that he would favor this approach to moral education.\n\nIn summary, I believe the answer is D. will produce someone who does the right thing simply because it is right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
