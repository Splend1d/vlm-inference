The President issued an executive order requiring all executive branch employees to use exclusively one brand of ballpoint pens and pencils as their writing utensils. According to a study, the federal government could save in excess of $250,000 a year in office supply costs if all executive agencies were to use standardized pens and pencils.\nB. The President issued an executive order requiring all executive branch employees to wear only white shirts and blouses during regular working hours. According to the President's directive, executive employees are prohibited from wearing colored (e. g. , blue or yellow) or striped shirts and blouses while on duty. The President issued the order in an effort to establish a uniform dress code for all executive employees.\nC. In 1887, Congress passed a law establishing a federal Commission of Birdwatchers. The Commission, which is still in effect, consists of seven members who are appointed by the President. The Commission's main function is to go on periodic retreats to photograph and study North American birds and their migratory habits. Believing that the Commission is archaic, the President decides that any future funding will simply be a waste of money. He thus executes an executive decree abrogating the Commission of Birdwatchers.\nD. A devastating hurricane damages an island which is part of a foreign country. The storm destroys many homes, resulting in death and injury to thousands. In response to a request from the foreign government for emergency aid, the President, without seeking the advice and consent of the Senate, issues an executive decree authorizing U. S. Army troops to the island to provide medical and humanitarian assistance.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this question about executive orders and which one is most likely to be found unconstitutional. There are four options, and I need to figure out which one of them might not pass constitutional muster. I'm not a lawyer or anything, but I do remember some basics about the U.S. government and the Constitution.\n\nFirst off, executive orders are directives issued by the President that have the force of law. They're usually based on authority granted by the Constitution or by Congress. But not all executive orders are constitutional, right? Sometimes, Presidents can overstep their bounds, either by exceeding their authority or by infringing on the powers of Congress or the courts.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A is about standardizing writing utensils in the executive branch to save money. It says that if all executive agencies use the same brand of pens and pencils, the government could save over $250,000 a year. That seems pretty straightforward. It's about efficiency and cost-saving. I can't see anything unconstitutional about that. The President has the authority to manage the executive branch efficiently, and this seems like a part of that. So, probably not unconstitutional.\n\nOption B is about requiring all executive branch employees to wear only white shirts and blouses during working hours,\u7981\u6b62\u7a7f\u5f69\u8272\u6216\u6761\u7eb9\u7684\u886c\u886b\u548c\u4e0a\u8863\u3002The reason given is to establish a uniform dress code for all executive employees. Hmm, this is interesting. Dress codes can be a touchy subject. On one hand, the President might have the authority to set dress codes for executive branch employees as part of workplace regulations. On the other hand, there could be arguments about personal expression or other constitutional rights. But I think this is more of a workplace policy issue than a constitutional one. Maybe it's not the strongest candidate for being unconstitutional.\n\nOption C is about dissolving the Commission of Birdwatchers, which was established by Congress in 1887. The President believes it's archaic and a waste of money, so he issues an executive decree to abolish it. Now, this seems tricky. The Commission was created by Congress, and generally, only Congress can abolish its own creations. The President might not have the authority to unilaterally abolish a commission established by Congress without congressional approval. That sounds like it could be unconstitutional, especially if it infringes upon Congress's power to establish and dissolve federal agencies.\n\nOption D is about responding to a natural disaster in a foreign country. After a devastating hurricane hits an island that's part of a foreign country, causing death and injury to thousands, the foreign government requests emergency aid. The President issues an executive decree authorizing U.S. Army troops to go to the island to provide medical and humanitarian assistance, without seeking the advice and consent of the Senate. This is interesting. Normally, deploying troops overseas would require some form of congressional authorization or at least notification, depending on the circumstances. However, in cases of humanitarian aid, especially when invited by the foreign government, there might be more flexibility.\n\nBut I recall that the War Powers Resolution requires the President to notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying troops into hostile situations and limits the duration of such deployments without congressional authorization. In this case, since it's humanitarian assistance and not a combat operation, maybe the rules are different. Still, it's possible that such a deployment could be challenged constitutionally, particularly if it's seen as an unauthorized use of military force.\n\nComparing Options C and D, both seem like they could be constitutionally problematic, but for different reasons. Option C involves the President dissolving a congressional creation, which directly challenges Congress's authority, while Option D involves the use of military force abroad, which touches on the President's commander-in-chief powers but still requires some congressional oversight.\n\nI think Option C is more clearly unconstitutional because it directly contravenes the principle that Congress has the power to establish and dissolve federal agencies, and the President doesn't have the authority to unilaterally abolish a commission created by Congress.\n\nIn Option D, while there might be constitutional questions about the use of military force without congressional approval, especially in non-combat humanitarian missions, it's less clear-cut than dissolving a congressional body.\n\nSo, my answer would be Option C: the President issuing an executive decree to abolish the Commission of Birdwatchers is most likely to be found unconstitutional.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
