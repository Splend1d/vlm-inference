                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of the following types of spectroscopy is a light-scattering technique? A. Nuclear magnetic resonance, B. Infrared, C. Raman, D. Ultraviolet-visible.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these is considered a light-scattering technique.\n\nFirst off, I should probably recall what a light-scattering technique is. Generally, light scattering involves the interaction of light with a sample, where the light is deflected or scattered in some way, and we can analyze the scattered light to get information about the sample's properties. So, among these options, which one involves scattering of light?\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nA. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR): NMR is a spectroscopic technique that involves the absorption of radiofrequency radiation by nuclei in a magnetic field. It's widely used for determining the structure of organic compounds. But does it involve light scattering? Not really. Light scattering typically involves higher frequencies like visible or near-infrared light, not radiofrequencies. So, probably not.\n\nB. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy: IR spectroscopy involves the absorption of infrared radiation by molecules, causing vibrations in chemical bonds. It's great for identifying functional groups in compounds. Again, this is absorption, not scattering of light. So, similar to NMR, it doesn't fit the description of a light-scattering technique.\n\nC. Raman spectroscopy: Now, Raman spectroscopy is interesting. It involves scattering of light by molecules. When light interacts with a molecule, most of the light is scattered elastically (Rayleigh scattering), but a small fraction is scattered inelastically, meaning the frequency of the light changes due to interactions with molecular vibrations or rotations. This is called Raman scattering. By analyzing the shifts in frequency of the scattered light, we can determine the vibrational modes of the molecule. So, this sounds like a light-scattering technique.\n\nD. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy: UV-Vis spectroscopy involves the absorption of ultraviolet and visible light by molecules, which causes electronic transitions within the molecules. It's commonly used to study the electronic structure of substances. Again, this is absorption, not scattering, of light.\n\nBased on this, it seems like Raman spectroscopy is the one that involves light scattering. But just to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nNMR: No, it's about nuclear spins in a magnetic field and radiofrequency absorption.\n\nIR: Absorption of infrared light corresponding to molecular vibrations.\n\nRaman: Scattering of light with frequency shifts due to molecular vibrations.\n\nUV-Vis: Absorption of UV and visible light causing electronic transitions.\n\nSo, yes, Raman is the one that involves scattering of light.\n\nWait a minute, sometimes people might refer to IR reflection spectroscopy as a type of scattering, but in reality, IR reflection is different from scattering. Reflection involves the bounce-back of light from a surface, while scattering involves the deflection of light in multiple directions due to interactions with particles in the sample.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Raman.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility of misinterpretation. For example, could UV-Vis scattering be a thing? Well, yes, there is something called Rayleigh scattering, which occurs in UV-Vis spectroscopy, but that's more about the scattering of light by particles much smaller than the wavelength of light, and it's not typically referred to as a spectroscopic technique in the same way that Raman is.\n\nSimilarly, in IR, there's IR reflection spectroscopy, but again, that's more about reflection than scattering.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I'm confident that Raman spectroscopy is the correct answer as it's directly based on the scattering of light to obtain spectral information.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Raman}} \\]"
