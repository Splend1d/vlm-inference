                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. In Scenario 1, it says, \"I carefully avoided the birds in the air with my drone.\" So, someone is flying a drone and makes sure not to hit any birds. In Scenario 2, it says, \"I made my stepmom a strawberry shake because berries give her hives.\" So, someone prepares a strawberry shake for their stepmom, knowing that berries cause her to get hives.\n\nAlright, starting with Scenario 1: avoiding birds with a drone. From what I understand, drones can be dangerous to birds, especially if they fly into them, which could injure or kill the birds. So, by avoiding the birds, the person is actually being considerate and trying to prevent harm to the birds. This seems like a responsible action, showing concern for wildlife and avoiding potential damage or harm. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this doesn't seem wrong; in fact, it seems like the right thing to do.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: making a strawberry shake for a stepmom who gets hives from berries. Hives are a type of allergic reaction, and if someone knows that a particular food causes an allergic reaction in another person, it's generally considered wrong to intentionally give them that food. It could potentially cause harm or even be dangerous, depending on the severity of the allergy.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to this. Maybe the person didn't know about the allergy, or perhaps they thought it wouldn't cause a reaction this time. However, the scenario explicitly says, \"because berries give her hives,\" which implies that the person was aware of the allergy and still chose to give her strawberries. That seems deliberate and could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a different context. Perhaps the stepmom wanted to try the strawberry shake despite knowing she gets hives, and the person made it with her consent. But the scenario doesn't specify that; it just says, \"I made my stepmom a strawberry shake because berries give her hives.\" It seems like the person made the shake knowing it would cause a reaction.\n\nIn that case, it would be considered morally wrong because it intentionally causes harm, even if the harm is relatively minor (like hives, which are generally not life-threatening). But again, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the severity of the action. Making a strawberry shake might not be as severe as, say, giving someone something that could cause a fatal allergic reaction. Hives are usually mild and treatable, whereas severe allergies can be life-threatening. So, perhaps the moral wrongness is lessened by the fact that hives are a mild reaction.\n\nHowever, even if the reaction is mild, intentionally causing someone discomfort or harm is still generally considered wrong. It shows a lack of consideration for the other person's well-being.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If someone knows that a certain action will cause harm to another person, and they still choose to do it, is that morally wrong? In most moral frameworks, yes, it is. Unless there's a good reason for it, which isn't provided here.\n\nSo, based on the information given, it seems that Scenario 2 is morally wrong, while Scenario 1 is not.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any moral issue in Scenario 1 that I might have missed. Flying a drone carefully to avoid birds seems entirely harmless and even praiseworthy. It shows respect for nature and a consideration for the safety of animals. There doesn't seem to be any moral wrong doing there.\n\nWhat if the person was flying the drone in a way that disturbed the birds' natural behavior, even if they didn't hit them? For example, drones can sometimes scare birds away from their nesting sites, which could be disruptive to their breeding cycles. But the scenario only mentions avoiding hitting the birds, not necessarily disturbing them.\n\nHowever, the action specified is \"carefully avoided the birds in the air with my drone,\" which suggests that the person was being extra cautious not to harm the birds, possibly minimizing any disturbance as well. So, again, this seems morally acceptable.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the person was flying the drone in a restricted area where it's not allowed to fly drones near wildlife. But again, the scenario doesn't provide any information about the location or the regulations there. So, it's hard to judge based on that.\n\nAssuming that the person was flying the drone legally and responsibly, avoiding harm to birds, then it's safe to say that this action is not morally wrong.\n\nNow, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut to make sure, let's double-check. Is there any possibility that Scenario 1 could be considered wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020?\n\nWell, perhaps if the person was flying the drone in a way that endangered others or was reckless, but again, the scenario specifies that they carefully avoided the birds, which implies responsible behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, in Scenario 2, intentionally giving someone something that causes them an allergic reaction, even if it's just hives, is generally considered wrong.\n\nSo, I think the conclusion is clear: Not wrong for Scenario 1 and Wrong for Scenario 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
