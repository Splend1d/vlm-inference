African National Congress, B. South African Democrats, C. Inkatha Freedom Party, D. Aryan National Assembly.\n\nOkay, I need to recall which political party Nelson Mandela led in South Africa. I remember that Nelson Mandela was a prominent figure in the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, and he became the first black President of South Africa after the end of apartheid.\n\nLet me think about the parties listed:\n\nA. African National Congress (ANC): I know that the ANC was a major political party that fought against apartheid. Mandela was a member of the ANC and played a significant role in its activities.\n\nB. South African Democrats: I don't recall this being a major political party in South Africa during the apartheid era. Maybe it's a lesser-known party.\n\nC. Inkatha Freedom Party: I think this was another political party in South Africa, but I don't remember if Mandela was associated with it.\n\nD. Aryan National Assembly: This sounds like it might be a white supremacist group, which wouldn't align with Mandela's beliefs and actions.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Mandela was indeed a member of the ANC, and he served as its President from 1991 to 1997. He was also the President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999, leading the country after the end of apartheid.\n\nSo, based on that, option A seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me consider the other options.\n\nOption B, South African Democrats: I think this might be a different party. I believe Mandela was primarily associated with the ANC.\n\nOption C, Inkatha Freedom Party: This was led by Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who was a political rival of Mandela's during the transition period. So, Mandela wasn't the head of this party.\n\nOption D, Aryan National Assembly: This sounds like a white nationalist organization, which would be contrary to Mandela's fight against racial discrimination.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. African National Congress.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll quickly verify some key points. Nelson Mandela joined the ANC in the 1940s, became involved in its Youth League, and rose through the ranks to become its President. He was instrumental in the ANC's efforts to end apartheid through both peaceful protests and, later, more militant actions.\n\nAfter his release from prison in 1990, he continued to lead the ANC in negotiations with the South African government, which ultimately led to the first multiracial elections in 1994, where he was elected President.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the correct answer is A. African National Congress.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
