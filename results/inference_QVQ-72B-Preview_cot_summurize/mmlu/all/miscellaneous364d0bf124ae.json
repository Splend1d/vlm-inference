                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"What is the chemical process wherein a solid is turned to a liquid via the application of heat?\" And the options are A. distillation, B. photosynthesis, C. freezing, D. melting. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a solid turning into a liquid when heat is applied. That sounds like a change of state, right? Like ice turning into water when it's warmed up.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Distillation: I remember distillation is a process where you heat a mixture to turn it into vapor and then cool it back to collect the liquid. Like making alcohol or purifying water. But that's more about separating components of a mixture, not directly turning a solid into a liquid.\n\nB. Photosynthesis: That's the process plants use to make food from sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water. Definitely not about turning solids into liquids with heat.\n\nC. Freezing: Freezing is when a liquid turns into a solid, usually by cooling it down. So that's the opposite of what the question is asking.\n\nD. Melting: This seems straightforward. Melting is when a solid turns into a liquid by applying heat. Like melting ice to get water.\n\nWait a minute, but is melting a chemical process? I thought chemical processes involve changes in the composition of substances, forming new substances with different properties. Melting doesn't change the composition; it just changes the state of the substance. So, is it really a chemical process?\n\nLet me double-check that. Maybe I should recall what defines a chemical change. Chemical changes involve breaking and forming new bonds, leading to the formation of new substances. For example, burning wood turns it into ash and gases, which are chemically different from the original wood.\n\nOn the other hand, physical changes don't alter the chemical composition of a substance; they only change its form or state. Melting is a physical change because the solid turns into a liquid without changing its chemical structure. The molecules are still the same, just moving differently.\n\nSo, if melting is a physical change, not a chemical process, then maybe the question is trickier than it seems. But wait, the question specifies \"chemical process,\" and according to my understanding, melting is a physical process, not chemical.\n\nMaybe I'm overthinking this. Perhaps in some contexts, melting could be considered a chemical process, but I don't think so. Let me consider if there are any chemical changes that accompany melting in some substances, but that would be specific cases, not generally applicable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing whether I know that melting is a physical change, not chemical. If that's the case, then selecting \"melting\" would be correct, even if it's not a chemical process.\n\nBut let's look back at the options:\n\nA. Distillation: Physical process, not chemical.\n\nB. Photosynthesis: Chemical process, but irrelevant to the question.\n\nC. Freezing: Physical process, opposite of melting.\n\nD. Melting: Physical process, matches the description in the question.\n\nSo, if I have to choose among these, D. melting seems to be the most appropriate answer, despite it being a physical process. Maybe the question has a typo, or perhaps in some contexts, melting is considered a chemical process, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to test the understanding that melting is a process where a solid turns into a liquid via heat application, and among the given options, it's the only one that fits the description, regardless of whether it's chemical or physical.\n\nIn that case, I should go with D. melting.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me think about another perspective. Maybe the question is about endothermic reactions, where heat is absorbed to change the state of matter. Melting is indeed an endothermic process because you have to add heat to turn a solid into a liquid.\n\nHowever, that still doesn't make it a chemical process; it's a physical one.\n\nPerhaps the confusion lies in the fact that during melting, some chemical properties remain unchanged, as it's just a change of state, not a change in composition.\n\nWait, maybe the question is misphrased and meant to ask about a physical process instead of chemical. But as per the given question, it specifies \"chemical process,\" so I need to answer based on that.\n\nGiven that, and considering that melting is a physical process, not chemical, I might consider that the question might have an error, or perhaps it's testing whether I can identify that none of the options are chemical processes fitting the description.\n\nBut since I have to choose among the given options, and melting is the only one that fits the description of turning a solid into a liquid via heat application, even if it's physically, I'll go with D. melting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing knowledge of exothermic and endothermic processes, but again, that relates more to physical changes.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The straightforward answer is D. melting, as it directly describes the process of turning a solid into a liquid with heat.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. melting}} \\]"
