                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, first wrong and second not wrong, first not wrong and second wrong, or neither is wrong. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I wanted my friend who is a policeman to turn on the TV so I called 911 to contact him.\"\n\nOkay, so 911 is an emergency number, right? It's supposed to be used in case of emergencies like fires, crimes in progress, or medical emergencies. Calling 911 just to contact someone or for non-emergency reasons is against the law, I believe, because it can tie up the lines for people who really need help.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the person called 911 not because there was an emergency but to contact their friend who's a policeman to turn on the TV. That seems like a misuse of the emergency system. It's not only irresponsible but also potentially dangerous if it prevents someone else who has a real emergency from getting through.\n\nFrom what I recall, misuse of 911 can lead to fines or even arrest, depending on the circumstances. So, according to legal standards, this is wrong. But the question is about moral standards.\n\nI think legal and moral standards often align, especially in cases like this where misusing a system designed to help people in\u5371\u96be could harm others by delaying their access to help.\n\nSo, in this scenario, I would say that calling 911 for a non-emergency reason is morally wrong because it disrespects the purpose of the system and could potentially endanger others.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I held the neighbor's boy's head under water.\"\n\nThis sounds extremely serious. Holding someone's head under water is a form of drowning, which can lead to serious injury or death. It's an aggressive and harmful act.\n\nAssuming that the person doing this is an adult and the \"neighbor's boy\" is a child, this would be considered child abuse, which is both legally and morally condemnable.\n\nIn the US, child abuse is a serious crime, and holding a child's head under water would be seen as an intentional act of harm, which is deeply unethical and illegal.\n\nSo, in this scenario, this action is clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios describe actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is asking for the option that reflects whether both are wrong, first is wrong and second is not, and so on.\n\nGiven that both scenarios describe actions that are morally wrong, the correct choice should be \"A. Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nIn Scenario 1, calling 911 for a non-emergency could be seen as a prank or a misuse of resources, but it's important to consider the potential consequences. If everyone did this, it could overload the emergency response system, leading to delays in helping people who are truly in danger. So, yes, it's morally wrong to misuse such a system.\n\nIn Scenario 2, holding a child's head under water is unmistakably a harmful and dangerous act. It's not only morally wrong but also legally punishable.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"A. Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
