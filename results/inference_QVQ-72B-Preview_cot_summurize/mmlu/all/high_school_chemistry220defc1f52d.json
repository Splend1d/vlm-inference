                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, and we're trying to find its molarity. We know that it reacts with hydrochloric acid (HCl), and we're given the volume and molarity of the HCl used to neutralize a certain volume of the NaOH solution. Okay, let's organize the information we have:\n\n- Volume of HCl: 42.6 mL\n- Molarity of HCl: 0.108 M (that means 0.108 moles per liter)\n- Volume of NaOH: 40.0 mL\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relationship between molarity, volume, and moles. Molarity is defined as moles of solute per liter of solution:\n\n\\[\nM = \\frac{n}{V}\n\\]\n\nSo, moles of solute can be found by:\n\n\\[\nn = M \\times V\n\\]\n\nBut I need to make sure that the units are consistent. The volumes are in milliliters, so I should convert them to liters since molarity is in moles per liter.\n\nLet's convert the volumes:\n\n\\[\n42.6 \\, \\text{mL} = 0.0426 \\, \\text{L}\n\\]\n\\[\n40.0 \\, \\text{mL} = 0.0400 \\, \\text{L}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to find the moles of HCl used:\n\n\\[\nn_{\\text{HCl}} = M_{\\text{HCl}} \\times V_{\\text{HCl}} = 0.108 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.0426 \\, \\text{L} = ?\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\[\n0.108 \\times 0.0426 = 0.0046 \\, \\text{moles}\n\\]\n\nSo, 0.0046 moles of HCl were used.\n\nNow, I need to relate this to the moles of NaOH. I recall that NaOH and HCl react in a 1:1 ratio in a neutralization reaction:\n\n\\[\n\\text{NaOH} + \\text{HCl} \\rightarrow \\text{NaCl} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}\n\\]\n\nSo, moles of NaOH should be equal to moles of HCl, which is 0.0046 moles.\n\nNow, I can find the molarity of NaOH using the formula:\n\n\\[\nM_{\\text{NaOH}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{NaOH}}}{V_{\\text{NaOH}}}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nM_{\\text{NaOH}} = \\frac{0.0046 \\, \\text{moles}}{0.0400 \\, \\text{L}} = 0.115 \\, \\text{M}\n\\]\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.0641 M\n\nB. 1.64 M\n\nC. 0.115 M\n\nD. 0.400 mol/L\n\nSo, 0.115 M matches option C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, converting volumes:\n\n42.6 mL = 0.0426 L\n\n40.0 mL = 0.0400 L\n\nThen, moles of HCl:\n\n\\[\nn_{\\text{HCl}} = 0.108 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.0426 \\, \\text{L} = 0.0046 \\, \\text{moles}\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSince the reaction is 1:1, moles of NaOH = moles of HCl = 0.0046 moles.\n\nThen, molarity of NaOH:\n\n\\[\nM_{\\text{NaOH}} = \\frac{0.0046 \\, \\text{moles}}{0.0400 \\, \\text{L}} = 0.115 \\, \\text{M}\n\\]\n\nEverything checks out. So, the correct answer is C. 0.115 M.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
