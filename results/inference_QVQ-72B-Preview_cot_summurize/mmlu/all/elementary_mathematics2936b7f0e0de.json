                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that a coach rounded the number of runners at a track meet to the nearest 10, and the rounded number is 400. I need to figure out which one of these options\u2014382, 397, 406, or 447\u2014could be the actual number of runners.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what it means to round to the nearest 10. When you round a number to the nearest 10, you're looking at the units place. If the units digit is 5 or greater, you round up to the next ten. If it's less than 5, you round down to the previous ten.\n\nSo, if the rounded number is 400, that means the actual number of runners must be closer to 400 than to 390 or 410 when rounding to the nearest 10.\n\nLet me think about the range of numbers that would round to 400. For a number to round to 400, it must be between 395 and 404, inclusive. Wait, why is that?\n\nWell, numbers from 395 to 399 would round up to 400, and numbers from 400 to 404 would round down to 400. So, the range is from 395 to 404, inclusive.\n\nLet me double-check that. Take 395: since the units digit is 5, it rounds up to 400. 396 rounds up to 400, 397 rounds up to 400, 398 rounds up to 400, and 399 rounds up to 400. Then, 400 stays at 400. 401 would round down to 400, as would 402, 403, and 404.\n\nWait a minute, 405 would round up to 410, so 404 is the highest number that rounds to 400.\n\nSo, the possible range is 395 to 404.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 382\n\nB. 397\n\nC. 406\n\nD. 447\n\nLet's see which of these fall within the range of 395 to 404.\n\nOption A: 382. That's below 395, so it doesn't round to 400.\n\nOption B: 397. That's within 395 to 404, so it does round to 400.\n\nOption C: 406. That's above 404, so it would round up to 410.\n\nOption D: 447. That's way above 404 and would round up to 450 or something, not 400.\n\nSo, the only option that fits is 397.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe there's a trick here.\n\nThe question says, \"the rounded number of runners is 400.\" It doesn't specify if it's to the nearest ten or hundred. Oh, but it says \"to the nearest 10,\" so yeah, the range is 395 to 404.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes rounding can be a bit tricky, so maybe I should consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the actual number as x, and when x is rounded to the nearest 10, it becomes 400.\n\nSo, x must be such that 395 \u2264 x < 405, and it's rounded to 400.\n\nWait, but 404 rounds down to 400 because 404 is closer to 400 than to 410.\n\nSimilarly, 397 is closer to 400 than to 390, so it rounds to 400.\n\nWhereas 382 is closer to 380, not 400, and 406 is closer to 410.\n\nSo, again, 397 is the correct choice.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other context that might make another option possible.\n\nSuppose the number of runners isn't exactly 397, but perhaps it's a range, but that doesn't seem likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a margin of error or something, but the problem states that it's rounded to the nearest 10.\n\nNo, I think it's straightforward. The answer should be B. 397.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the actual number of runners at the track meet,\" and among the options, only 397 falls within the required range.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is B. 397.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 397} \\]"
