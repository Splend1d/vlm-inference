                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out what the best defense is for Albert Attorney if Gordon Greedy sues him for professional malpractice in 2005. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, some background: Albert is a solo practitioner in Littletown, and in 1990, he drafted a document for a client's estate plan that violated the rule against perpetuities. This mistake wasn't discovered until the testator died in 2004, and because of the error, the estate plan wasn't admitted to probate. As a result, the assets were distributed according to the state's intestacy statute. Gordon was supposed to get a substantial portion under the estate plan but didn't get anything because he wasn't a relative and thus didn't take under the intestate statute.\n\nNow, the state has a three-year statute of limitations for professional malpractice. Gordon decides to sue Albert in 2005 for this mistake. I need to figure out the best defense Albert can assert in this situation.\n\nOption A says that the statute of limitations has run, so Gordon's lawsuit is not timely. Hmm, the statute of limitations is three years for professional malpractice. The error was discovered in 2004 when the testator died, and Gordon is suing in 2005. That's only one year after the discovery of the error. Generally, the statute of limitations starts running when the injury is discovered or should have been discovered. So, if Gordon discovered the error in 2004, and sued in 2005, he's within the three-year window. Unless there's something else at play here, like when the injury occurred or when the malpractice happened, but based on the information given, it seems like the statute of limitations hasn't run yet. So, maybe this isn't the best defense.\n\nOption B is that the legal fee for the original estate plan was never paid. Well, that might be a separate issue. If Gordon is suing for malpractice because of the error in the estate plan, whether the fee was paid or not might not directly relate to the malpractice claim. Maybe Albert can counterclaim for unpaid fees, but that doesn't defend against the malpractice allegation itself. So, probably not the best defense here.\n\nOption C says that the rule against perpetuities is too complicated for the average lawyer in Littletown to understand. Okay, so the rule against perpetuities is indeed a complex area of law, especially for general practitioners. If Albert can argue that in his locality, the average lawyer wouldn't be expected to understand this rule, then perhaps he can defend against the malpractice claim by saying that he met the standard of care expected of a lawyer in Littletown at that time. But, I think this might be a weak defense because even general practitioners should have a basic understanding of estate planning laws, including the rule against perpetuities, since it's a fundamental part of estate planning.\n\nOption D states that Gordon was not an eligible taker under the estate plan. Wait a minute, the problem says that Gordon was named as a substantial taker under the estate plan but didn't take under the intestate statute because he wasn't a relative. So, according to the estate plan, he was supposed to receive something, but due to the error, the plan was invalid, and he got nothing. So, he has a clear interest in the estate plan and was directly harmed by the error. Saying he wasn't an eligible taker doesn't seem to hold water because the plan specifically named him as a beneficiary.\n\nSo, considering all these options, I think the best defense Albert can assert is Option C: that the rule against perpetuities is too complicated for the average lawyer in Littletown to understand. While I think this defense is somewhat weak, compared to the other options, it's probably the strongest argument Albert can make in this scenario.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let me consider if there are any other possible defenses that aren't listed. For example, perhaps Albert can argue that the error didn't actually cause harm to Gordon because the intestate statute provided a better distribution, but that's not the case here since Gordon received nothing under intestacy. Another possible defense could be that Albert didn't have a direct attorney-client relationship with Gordon, but that seems unlikely since Gordon was a named beneficiary in the estate plan. Generally, attorneys owe a duty to their clients, not to beneficiaries, but in some cases, beneficiaries can sue for malpractice if the attorney's error causes them direct harm. So, perhaps Albert could argue that he didn't owe a duty to Gordon, but I think that's a stretch.\n\nGiven the options provided, I still think Option C is the best defense Albert can assert.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
