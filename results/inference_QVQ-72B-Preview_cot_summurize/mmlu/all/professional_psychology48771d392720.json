                    "text": "So I've got this genetics problem here. It says that a woman transmits color blindness to her son, even though she herself has normal color vision. And the question is asking what this defect represents in terms of her:\n\nA. Y chromosome\n\nB. dominant genes\n\nC. genotype\n\nD. phenotype\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First off, I know that color blindness is usually a sex-linked trait, specifically X-linked. So, color blindness is typically passed down through the X chromosome.\n\nNow, the woman has normal color vision, but she's passing on the color blindness trait to her son. That means she must be a carrier of the trait. In genetics, a carrier is someone who has one normal allele and one mutated allele for a particular gene, but the normal allele masks the mutated one, so they don't show the trait themselves.\n\nSince it's an X-linked recessive trait, males only have one X chromosome, so if they inherit the mutated allele, they'll express the trait because they don't have a second X to mask it.\n\nSo, in this case, the woman must have one normal allele and one mutated allele for the color blindness gene. Her phenotype is normal because the normal allele is dominant, but her genotype includes the mutated allele, which she can pass on to her son.\n\nLet me see what the options are again:\n\nA. Y chromosome \u2013 Well, the Y chromosome is only present in males, and since she's a woman, she doesn't have a Y chromosome. So, this can't be right.\n\nB. dominant genes \u2013 Color blindness is a recessive trait, so it's not dominant. The normal vision is dominant, and color blindness is recessive.\n\nC. genotype \u2013 This refers to her genetic makeup, which includes both alleles for the gene in question.\n\nD. phenotype \u2013 This is her physical expression, which is normal color vision.\n\nGiven that she's passing on the color blindness trait to her son, it means that she has the mutated allele in her genotype, even though it's not expressed in her phenotype because it's masked by the dominant normal allele.\n\nSo, the defect is part of her genotype, option C.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. If she's a carrier, she has one normal and one mutated allele. Her phenotype is normal because the normal allele is dominant. But she can pass the mutated allele to her son, who, being male, will express the trait if he inherits her X chromosome with the mutated allele.\n\nSo, the defect is indeed part of her genotype, not her phenotype, since her phenotype is normal.\n\nI think the answer is C. genotype.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
