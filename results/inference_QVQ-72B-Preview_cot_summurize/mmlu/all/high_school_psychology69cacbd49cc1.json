                    "text": "So I have this question about Eli, who is just starting to sit up. The question is asking, assuming he's developing at a typical pace, how old is he? And the options are 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, or 9 months.\n\nAlright, I need to recall some typical developmental milestones for babies. I remember that babies usually go through certain stages as they grow and develop their motor skills.\n\nLet me think about sitting up. I think babies start to hold their heads up around 3 or 4 months, and then they gradually learn to sit with support. But when do they typically start sitting up on their own?\n\nI think the average age for babies to start sitting up on their own is around 6 months. Let me see if that's right.\n\nLet me consider the options again:\n\nA. 1 month\n\nAt 1 month, babies are still very young. They're mostly focused on basic functions like eating and sleeping. They might be able to lift their heads a little when lying on their stomachs, but sitting up is usually not something they can do at this age.\n\nB. 3 months\n\nBy 3 months, babies are more active. They can hold their heads up steadily and might be able to sit up with some support, like being propped up with pillows or held by an adult. But sitting up completely on their own might still be a bit early.\n\nC. 6 months\n\nAround 6 months, many babies start to sit up on their own without support. They have developed enough strength in their back and neck muscles to maintain their balance while sitting.\n\nD. 9 months\n\nBy 9 months, babies are not only sitting up well but might also be starting to crawl or stand holding onto furniture. So, if Eli is just beginning to sit up, 9 months seems a bit advanced.\n\nBased on this, I think the best answer is C. 6 months.\n\nBut to make sure, let me do a quick check. I recall that there are general guidelines for infant development milestones:\n\n- 2-3 months: Babies can hold their heads up steadily when lying on their stomachs.\n\n- 4-5 months: They can sit up with support.\n\n- 6-7 months: They can sit up on their own.\n\n- 8-10 months: They start crawling.\n\n- 10-12 months: They might stand holding onto furniture.\n\nSo, according to these guidelines, around 6 months is when babies typically start sitting up on their own.\n\nI think that aligns with my initial thought. Therefore, the answer should be C. 6 months.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any variation in development that might affect this.\n\nI know that every baby develops at their own pace, and some might sit up earlier or later than the average. However, the question specifies that we're assuming typical pace, so I think it's safe to go with the general guideline.\n\nAlso, factors like prematurity can affect development milestones, but since the question doesn't mention anything like that, I don't need to account for that here.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether Eli is being developmentally stimulated or not, but again, the question doesn't provide any information to suggest that, so I'll assume typical development.\n\nTherefore, based on standard developmental milestones, Eli is likely around 6 months old if he's just starting to sit up on his own.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. 6 months.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
