Hmm, I need to figure this out. I'm pretty sure I've heard of Huey Lewis, but I might be mixing him up with someone else.\n\nFirst off, I know that Huey Lewis is a musician, probably from the 80s or 90s. I think he had a band, but I can't remember the exact name. Let me see... Option A is \"The News.\" That sounds familiar. I think there's a band called Huey Lewis and the News. Yeah, that rings a bell. They had some hits back in the day.\n\nOption B is \"The Attractions.\" I think that's the band that backed up Elvis Costello. So, that doesn't seem right for Huey Lewis.\n\nOption C is \"The Silver Bullet Band.\" That sounds like it might be associated with Bob Seger. Yeah, I think Bob Seger had a band called The Silver Bullet Band. So, probably not Huey Lewis's band.\n\nOption D is \"Louie and Dewey.\" That sounds more like a cartoon reference, like from \"Darkwing Duck\" or something. So, that can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently. Maybe I should consider the genre or the type of music Huey Lewis played. I think he was into rock and roll, maybe some blues influences. His band was probably named something that fit that style.\n\nLet me try recalling some of his songs. I think he had a hit with \"The Power of Love\" from the \"Back to the Future\" soundtrack. And there was \"Hip to Be Square,\" which was also popular. Yeah, those are definitely Huey Lewis and the News songs.\n\nMaybe I should just trust my memory on this. I remember that the band was called Huey Lewis and the News. So, according to that, the answer should be A. The News.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there could be any confusion. Is there another band with a similar name? Well, there's New Kids on the Block, but that's different. Or The Newsboys, but that's a Christian rock band. So, no, I don't think there's confusion there.\n\nWhat about the formation of the band? Did they start as The News and then Huey Lewis joined, or was it always Huey Lewis and the News? I'm not sure about that. Maybe that could affect the naming.\n\nLet me see, if I recall correctly, Huey Lewis formed the band in the late 70s, and they became famous in the 80s. I don't think the band existed before him, so it was probably always Huey Lewis and the News.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to look at their albums. I remember \"Sports\" was a big album for them in the 80s. I think it said Huey Lewis and the News on the cover. Yeah, that seems consistent.\n\nMaybe I should think about the composition of the band. Did they have a horn section? I think they did, which was part of their sound. But that probably doesn't help me determine the name.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the context of the question. It says, \"What was the name of Huey Lewis's band?\" and provides four options. Since Huey Lewis is known primarily for being in Huey Lewis and the News, that seems like the most logical answer.\n\nI don't think it's a trick question, where they might be trying to see if I know some obscure fact about a different band name he used early on or anything like that. It seems straightforward.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll try to recall if Huey Lewis ever had another band with a different name. I don't think so. He might have been in different bands before forming Huey Lewis and the News, but that was his main act.\n\nAlright, I think I've thought through this enough. I'm confident that the correct answer is A. The News.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ The \\ News} \\]"
