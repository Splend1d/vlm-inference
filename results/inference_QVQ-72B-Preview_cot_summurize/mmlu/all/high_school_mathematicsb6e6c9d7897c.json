                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"If we take sin x and change it to 3 sin 2x, what will happen to the domain and range of the function?\" And there are four options to choose from. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the domain and range of the sine function are. For sin x, where x is in radians, the domain is all real numbers, right? Because sine is defined for all real numbers. Its range is between -1 and 1, inclusive. So, domain is (-\u221e, \u221e) and range is [-1, 1].\n\nNow, if I change sin x to 3 sin 2x, there are two things happening here: there's a coefficient of 3 in front of the sine function, and the argument of the sine function is 2x instead of just x.\n\nLet me think about the effect of these changes on the domain and range.\n\nStarting with the domain:\n\nDoes changing sin x to sin 2x restrict or expand the domain in any way? Sin 2x is still defined for all real numbers because sine is defined for all real inputs, regardless of the coefficient in front of x. So, I think the domain remains all real numbers.\n\nBut wait, let's consider if there's any restriction based on the period or something like that. The period of sin x is 2\u03c0, right? Sin 2x has a period of \u03c0 because the period is (2\u03c0)/|b|, where b is the coefficient of x in sin bx. So, in this case, b = 2, so period is \u03c0. But does this affect the domain? I don't think so, because both functions are defined for all real x.\n\nSo, I believe the domain remains the same.\n\nNow, about the range.\n\nFirst, consider sin x has a range of [-1, 1]. If I multiply it by 3, turning it into 3 sin x, what happens to the range? Well, multiplying by 3 scales the output of the sine function by 3. So, if sin x goes from -1 to 1, then 3 sin x goes from -3 to 3. So, the range becomes [-3, 3].\n\nBut in our function, it's not just 3 sin x; it's 3 sin 2x. So, there's an additional change in the argument from x to 2x.\n\nI need to understand how changing the argument from x to 2x affects the range.\n\nFirst, what does sin 2x do compared to sin x? Sin 2x has twice the frequency, meaning it completes two full cycles in the interval from 0 to 2\u03c0. But does this affect the range?\n\nLet me think about it. The range of sin 2x is still [-1, 1] because the sine function, regardless of the frequency, will still oscillate between -1 and 1. So, multiplying by 3 would scale that range to [-3, 3].\n\nWait, but let's confirm this.\n\nConsider sin 2x: its range is [-1, 1].\n\nNow, 3 sin 2x: since sin 2x can be as low as -1 and as high as 1, multiplying by 3 will make it as low as -3 and as high as 3.\n\nSo, the range is [-3, 3].\n\nTherefore, compared to sin x, which has a range of [-1, 1], 3 sin 2x has a range of [-3, 3].\n\nSo, the range has been tripled.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me see.\n\nIf sin x has a range of [-1, 1], then 3 sin x has a range of [-3, 3], and sin 2x has a range of [-1, 1], so 3 sin 2x should also have a range of [-3, 3].\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, domain remains all real numbers, and range is tripled from [-1, 1] to [-3, 3].\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Domain and range remain the same\n\nB. Domain is double; range remains the same\n\nC. Domain is tripled; range is doubled\n\nD. Domain is the same; range is tripled\n\nSo, according to my reasoning, the domain is the same, and the range is tripled.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOriginal function: sin x\n\nDomain: all real numbers\n\nRange: [-1, 1]\n\nNew function: 3 sin 2x\n\nDomain: all real numbers (unchanged)\n\nRange: [-3, 3] (tripled)\n\nSo, option D seems correct.\n\nWait, but option C says domain is tripled and range is doubled. Is that possible?\n\nNo, because domain should remain the same, as explained.\n\nOption C is incorrect because domain is not tripled; it remains the same.\n\nOption D says domain is the same; range is tripled, which matches our conclusion.\n\nBut let's see option A: domain and range remain the same. Clearly, range is not the same, so A is incorrect.\n\nOption B: domain is double; range remains the same. No, domain is not double; it remains the same, and range is tripled.\n\nSo, B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: domain is tripled; range is doubled. Domain is not tripled, and range is tripled, so C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: domain is the same; range is tripled. Matches our conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D.\n\nBut wait, in the explanation, it says that the range is tripled, but does the range actually triple in size?\n\nLet's think about it carefully.\n\nOriginal range: [-1, 1], which has a length of 2.\n\nNew range: [-3, 3], which has a length of 6.\n\nSo, the new range is three times the original range.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if we think in terms of scaling, multiplying by 3 scales the range by a factor of 3.\n\nSo, yes, the range is tripled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D: domain is the same; range is tripled.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
