                    "text": "So I need to find the remainder when the 100th Fibonacci number is divided by 4. I know that the Fibonacci sequence starts with 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, and each term is the sum of the two preceding ones. But calculating the 100th term directly would be too time-consuming, so there must be a smarter way to approach this.\n\nFirst, I recall that when dealing with remainders of sequences, it's often helpful to look for patterns or cycles in the remainders. Maybe the remainders repeat after a certain number of terms. If I can find the pattern in the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4, I can determine where the 100th term falls in that pattern.\n\nLet me start by computing the first few Fibonacci numbers and their remainders when divided by 4.\n\nF(1) = 1, remainder 1\n\nF(2) = 1, remainder 1\n\nF(3) = 2, remainder 2\n\nF(4) = 3, remainder 3\n\nF(5) = 5, remainder 1\n\nF(6) = 8, remainder 0\n\nF(7) = 13, remainder 1\n\nF(8) = 21, remainder 1\n\nF(9) = 34, remainder 2\n\nF(10) = 55, remainder 3\n\nF(11) = 89, remainder 1\n\nF(12) = 144, remainder 0\n\nF(13) = 233, remainder 1\n\nF(14) = 377, remainder 1\n\nF(15) = 610, remainder 2\n\nF(16) = 987, remainder 3\n\nF(17) = 1597, remainder 1\n\nF(18) = 2584, remainder 0\n\nF(19) = 4181, remainder 1\n\nF(20) = 6765, remainder 1\n\nLooking at these remainders: 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1,...\n\nIt seems like the pattern repeats every 6 terms: 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0. Let's check a few more to confirm.\n\nF(21) = 10946\n\n10946 divided by 4 is 2736 with remainder 2\n\nYes, that fits the pattern: 2\n\nF(22) = 17711\n\n17711 divided by 4 is 4427 with remainder 3\n\nF(23) = 28657\n\n28657 divided by 4 is 7164 with remainder 1\n\nF(24) = 46368\n\n46368 divided by 4 is 11592 with remainder 0\n\nF(25) = 75025\n\n75025 divided by 4 is 18756 with remainder 1\n\nF(26) = 121393\n\n121393 divided by 4 is 30348 with remainder 1\n\nOkay, the pattern does repeat every 6 terms: 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0.\n\nSo, the sequence modulo 4 cycles every 6 terms.\n\nNow, to find the remainder of F(100) modulo 4, I can find the position of 100 in this 6-term cycle.\n\nI can find 100 modulo 6.\n\n100 divided by 6 is 16 with a remainder of 4, so 100 \u2261 4 mod 6.\n\nLooking back at the pattern:\n\nPosition 1: 1\n\nPosition 2: 1\n\nPosition 3: 2\n\nPosition 4: 3\n\nPosition 5: 1\n\nPosition 6: 0\n\nSince 100 \u2261 4 mod 6, the remainder when F(100) is divided by 4 should be the same as the remainder in position 4 of the cycle, which is 3.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nIn the pattern, position 4 corresponds to F(4), which is 3.\n\nSimilarly, F(10) is also position 4 in the cycle, and indeed, F(10) = 55, which is 3 mod 4.\n\nAnd F(16) = 987, which is 3 mod 4.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the 100th Fibonacci number is divided by 4 is 3.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 2\n\nB. 3\n\nC. 4\n\nD. 5\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. 3.\n\nBut wait, option C is 4, which doesn't make sense because Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially and won't always be divisible by 4, as seen in the earlier terms.\n\nOption D is 5, which is also impossible since remainders modulo 4 can only be 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
