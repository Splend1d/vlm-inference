                    "text": "So I have this problem here about a linear transformation T from R\u00b2 to R\u00b2. It says that T maps the point (1, 2) to (2, 3) and the point (-1, 2) to (2, -3). And I need to find out where T maps the point (2, 1). The options are A. (1, 6), B. (-1, 4), C. (3, 2), and D. (-4, 3).\n\nAlright, first things first, since T is a linear transformation, I know that T(0,0) = (0,0), because linear transformations map the zero vector to the zero vector. But wait, actually, I should confirm that. In linear algebra, a transformation is linear if it satisfies two properties: T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v) and T(cu) = cT(u), for vectors u and v and scalar c. Also, yes, T(0) = 0.\n\nBut in this problem, they've given me T of two specific points: (1,2) and (-1,2), and their images. I need to find T(2,1).\n\nHmm, maybe I can find the matrix representation of T. Since T is from R\u00b2 to R\u00b2, it can be represented by a 2x2 matrix. Let's denote the matrix as A = [a b; c d], where a, b, c, d are real numbers. Then, T(x,y) = A * [x y]^T = [a*x + b*y; c*x + d*y].\n\nGiven that T(1,2) = (2,3), that means:\n\na*1 + b*2 = 2\n\nc*1 + d*2 = 3\n\nSimilarly, T(-1,2) = (2,-3), so:\n\na*(-1) + b*2 = 2\n\nc*(-1) + d*2 = -3\n\nSo I have a system of four equations:\n\n1) a + 2b = 2\n\n2) c + 2d = 3\n\n3) -a + 2b = 2\n\n4) -c + 2d = -3\n\nLet me try to solve these equations to find a, b, c, d.\n\nFrom equation 1: a = 2 - 2b\n\nFrom equation 3: -a + 2b = 2\n\nSubstitute a from equation 1 into equation 3:\n\n-(2 - 2b) + 2b = 2\n\n-2 + 2b + 2b = 2\n\n4b = 4\n\nb = 1\n\nThen, a = 2 - 2*1 = 0\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: c + 2d = 3\n\nFrom equation 4: -c + 2d = -3\n\nNow, add equations 2 and 4:\n\n(c + 2d) + (-c + 2d) = 3 + (-3)\n\n4d = 0 \u2192 d = 0\n\nThen, c + 0 = 3 \u2192 c = 3\n\nSo, the matrix A is:\n\n[0 1]\n\n[3 0]\n\nTherefore, T(x,y) = [0 1; 3 0] * [x y]^T = [y; 3x]\n\nNow, apply this to (2,1):\n\nT(2,1) = [1; 3*2] = [1; 6]\n\nSo, the answer should be (1,6), which is option A.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nGiven T(1,2) = (2,3):\n\n0*1 + 1*2 = 2\n\n3*1 + 0*2 = 3\n\nCorrect.\n\nT(-1,2) = (2,-3):\n\n0*(-1) + 1*2 = 2\n\n3*(-1) + 0*2 = -3\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnd T(2,1) = [1; 6]\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ (1,\\ 6)} \\]"
