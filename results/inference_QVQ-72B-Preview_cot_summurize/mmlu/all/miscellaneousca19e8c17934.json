Hmm, I'm pretty sure Hank II isn't a pope. I think it's a trick option. So, I can probably eliminate that one.\n\nNow, between John XXIII, Paul VI, and John Paul I, I need to figure out who was pope right before John Paul II. I remember that John Paul II was pope for a long time, and he was followed by Benedict XVI. But who was before John Paul II?\n\nLet me think about this. I think John Paul I was pope for a very short time before John Paul II. Was that the case? I recall that John Paul I had a brief papacy, maybe a few months or something like that, and then John Paul II took over.\n\nWait, actually, let me recall: John Paul I was elected in August 1978, and he died in September of the same year. Then John Paul II was elected in October 1978. So, yes, John Paul I was the pope immediately before John Paul II.\n\nBut let me double-check. Was there anyone else in between? No, I don't think so. It was John Paul I, then John Paul II.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. John Paul I.\n\nWait, but what about John XXIII and Paul VI? Where do they fit in? I think Paul VI was before John XXIII. Let me see.\n\nActually, no. John XXIII was pope from 1958 to 1963, and Paul VI was from 1963 to 1978. So, Paul VI was followed by John Paul I, and then John Paul II.\n\nSo, to reiterate, the sequence is Paul VI, John Paul I, John Paul II.\n\nTherefore, the immediate predecessor of John Paul II was John Paul I.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is C. John Paul I.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
