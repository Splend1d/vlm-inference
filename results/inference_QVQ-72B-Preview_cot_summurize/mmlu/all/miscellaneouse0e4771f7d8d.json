Hmm, I need to pick the correct one. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst off, I know that sailing around the world means completing a circumnavigation of the Earth. I believe the first person to attempt this was Ferdinand Magellan, but I think he didn't complete the entire journey himself. Wait, did he die during the trip? I think he was killed in the Philippines. So, if that's the case, maybe the ship he commanded continued and finished the circumnavigation without him.\n\nLooking at the options, \"Magellan\" is one of them, but since he didn't personally complete the journey, maybe the ship that finished the trip has a different name. Let me see.\n\nOption B is \"Victoria.\" I recall that Magellan's expedition had several ships, and I think Victoria was one of them. Maybe it was the only one that successfully completed the circumnavigation.\n\nOption A is \"Triton.\" I don't remember Triton being part of Magellan's expedition. Triton sounds more like a mythological figure or perhaps a modern submarine. So, probably not the right choice.\n\nOption D is \"Elizabeth II.\" That sounds familiar, but I think that's a more recent ship, named after Queen Elizabeth of England. It's probably too modern to be the first ship to sail around the world.\n\nSo, between options B and C, I need to choose. Since Magellan didn't finish the journey, I don't think \"Magellan\" is the correct answer. Therefore, \"Victoria\" seems like a likely choice.\n\nLet me double-check this. I remember that Magellan set sail from Spain in 1519 with five ships: Trinidad, San Antonio, Concepci\u00f3n, Santiago, and Victoria. During the journey, Santiago was wrecked in a storm, and San Antonio mutinied and returned to Spain. So, that left Trinidad, Concepci\u00f3n, and Victoria to continue the voyage.\n\nMagellan was killed in the Philippines in 1521, and the expedition was taken over by another navigator, I think his name was Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano. Under Elcano's command, the Victoria completed the first circumnavigation of the globe, returning to Spain in 1522.\n\nSo, yes, Victoria was the first ship to sail around the world. Trinidad tried to return as well but was lost somewhere in the Moluccas or on the way back. So, Victoria was the only ship from Magellan's expedition to complete the entire journey.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Victoria.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll consider if there was any other ship that might have circumnavigated the globe earlier. I don't think so. I believe Magellan's expedition was the first to successfully sail around the world.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The answer is B. Victoria.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ Victoria} \\]"
