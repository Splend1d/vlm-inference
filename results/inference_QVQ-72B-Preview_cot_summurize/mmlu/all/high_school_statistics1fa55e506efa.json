                    "text": "Let's see what this question is about. Tina is doing a science fair project to estimate the average amount of chemicals in her city's water supply. She initially planned to take a random sample of 15 observations but was asked to take 35 observations instead. The mean and standard deviation from these 35 observations turned out to be roughly the same as those from the initial 15 observations. Now, the question is asking whether there's any advantage in using 35 observations over 15, given that the mean and standard deviation are about the same.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how sample size affects the confidence interval for the population mean. Confidence intervals give us an estimated range within which the true population mean is likely to fall, based on our sample data. The width of this interval depends on several factors: the sample mean, the standard deviation of the sample, the sample size, and the desired level of confidence.\n\nThe formula for a confidence interval for the population mean, assuming a normal distribution, is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sample Mean} \\pm (t \\times \\frac{\\text{Standard Deviation}}{\\sqrt{\\text{Sample Size}}})\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(t\\) is the t-score corresponding to the desired level of confidence and degrees of freedom.\n\nGiven that the mean and standard deviation are about the same for both sample sizes, the only difference in the confidence interval calculation would be the denominator, which is \\(\\sqrt{\\text{Sample Size}}\\). Since 35 is larger than 15, \\(\\sqrt{35}\\) is larger than \\(\\sqrt{15}\\), which would suggest that the margin of error term \\(\\frac{\\text{Standard Deviation}}{\\sqrt{\\text{Sample Size}}}\\) would be smaller for \\(n=35\\) compared to \\(n=15\\), assuming the standard deviation remains the same.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the mean and standard deviation from the 35 observations are approximately the same as those from the 15 observations. So, if both the mean and standard deviation are unchanged, but the sample size is increased, what impact does that have on the confidence interval?\n\nWait a minute, if the standard deviation is the same for both samples, but the sample size increases, the standard error (which is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size) decreases. This means that the confidence interval should be narrower for the larger sample size, all else being equal.\n\nBut the problem mentions that the mean and standard deviation are about the same for both sample sizes. So, even if the standard deviation is the same, increasing the sample size reduces the standard error, leading to a narrower confidence interval.\n\nTherefore, using 35 observations instead of 15 should result in a more precise estimate of the population mean, as the confidence interval would be narrower, assuming the same level of confidence.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. There is no advantage. Because the mean and the standard deviation are about the same, the confidence interval computed using 35 observations should be approximately the same as that computed using 15 observations.\n\nThis seems incorrect because, as I just thought, increasing the sample size should lead to a narrower confidence interval, even if the standard deviation remains the same.\n\nB. There is no advantage. In fact, the 20 extra observations will increase the likelihood of error.\n\nThis doesn't make sense. Larger sample sizes generally lead to more reliable estimates, not increased likelihood of error.\n\nC. There is no advantage. Because she took 35 observations instead of 15 observations, the confidence interval using 35 observations will be wider than that using 15 observations.\n\nThis contradicts the principle that larger sample sizes lead to narrower confidence intervals, assuming the standard deviation remains constant.\n\nD. There is some advantage. Because she took 35 observations instead of 15 observations, the confidence interval using 35 observations will be narrower than that using 15 observations.\n\nThis aligns with what I've just reasoned. Larger sample sizes lead to smaller standard errors, which in turn lead to narrower confidence intervals.\n\nSo, the correct choice should be D.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nOne thing to consider is that with a larger sample size, the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution more closely. However, since both samples are larger than 30 (n=15 is less than 30, but n=35 is greater), the difference in the t-scores might not be significant. But still, the main effect is that the standard error decreases with larger sample sizes, leading to narrower intervals.\n\nAnother consideration could be that with more observations, the estimate of the standard deviation might be more accurate, which could also lead to a more accurate confidence interval.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the mean and standard deviation are approximately the same for both sample sizes. So, perhaps the estimate of the standard deviation is similar in both cases.\n\nHowever, even if the standard deviation estimate is the same, increasing the sample size reduces the standard error, leading to narrower confidence intervals.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the correct choice.\n\nI think the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
