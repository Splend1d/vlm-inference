So, if the United States is exporting more goods and services, that means American companies are selling more stuff overseas.\n\nNow, in terms of currency, when US companies export goods, they typically get paid in foreign currency. For example, if Ford sells cars to Germany, they might get paid in euros. But Ford needs dollars to operate, so they'll exchange those euros back into dollars. This means that as exports increase, there's an increased demand for dollars because foreign buyers need to buy dollars to pay for those American goods.\n\nWait, no. Actually, it's a bit nuanced. Let me think again.\n\nWhen a foreign buyer wants to buy American goods, they need to pay in dollars because that's the currency American companies use. So, if European companies are buying more American goods, they need to get dollars to pay for those goods. This means they have to exchange their euros for dollars, which increases the demand for dollars in the foreign exchange market.\n\nAs per the law of supply and demand, if demand for dollars increases while the supply remains constant (assuming all else equal), then the value of the dollar should rise. So, this suggests that option B might be correct: the value of the dollar rises as demand for dollars increases.\n\nBut let's double-check. If the US is exporting more, foreign buyers need more dollars to pay for those exports, which increases the demand for dollars. Increased demand for a currency typically leads to an appreciation in its value. So, the dollar should go up in value.\n\nOption A says the value of the dollar falls as the supply of dollars increases. But in this scenario, we're talking about increased exports leading to increased demand for dollars, not increased supply of dollars. So, this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nOption C says the value of the dollar falls as demand for dollars decreases. But in our scenario, demand for dollars is increasing due to higher exports, so this doesn't apply.\n\nOption D says the value of the dollar rises as the supply of dollars increases. That doesn't make sense because if the supply of dollars increases, holding demand constant, the value of the dollar should decrease, not increase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: the value of the dollar rises as demand for dollars increases.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any way that increased exports could lead to a decrease in the dollar's value. I don't think so, because increased exports typically lead to increased demand for dollars, which should push the value up, not down.\n\nUnless, of course, there are other factors at play, like if the US was importing a lot at the same time, which could increase the supply of dollars, but the question states \"all else equal,\" so we can assume that only exports are changing.\n\nAlright, I'm pretty confident now that option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
