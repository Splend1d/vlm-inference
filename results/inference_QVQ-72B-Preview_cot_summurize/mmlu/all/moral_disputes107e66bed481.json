                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about Christopher Heath Wellman's position on immigration and borders. I'm not super familiar with his work, but I think he's written about political philosophy and immigration ethics. The question is asking about what he defends, and there are four options. Let me read them again to make sure I understand.\n\nOption A says that anti-egalitarianism is compatible with liberal cosmopolitanism. Hmm, that sounds a bit confusing. Anti-egalitarianism suggests opposing equality in some form, and liberal cosmopolitanism probably advocates for global equality or something like that. So, is he arguing that you can be against equality and still be a liberal cosmopolitan? Not sure.\n\nOption B says that closing borders to all potential immigrants is an inherently racist social policy. That's a strong statement. It's suggesting that any policy to close borders is based on race, which doesn't seem right. There could be other reasons for closing borders, like economic concerns or national security. So, I doubt that Wellman would take such an extreme position.\n\nOption C says that nation-states have an obligation to open their borders to the least well-off potential immigrants. That sounds altruistic. It's suggesting that countries should prioritize helping the poorest or most disadvantaged immigrants. While that might be a noble idea, I wonder if Wellman actually argues that it's an obligation.\n\nOption D says that nation-states have a presumptive right to close their borders to all potential immigrants. This seems like a more traditional view, giving countries the right to control their own borders. It's possible that Wellman supports this, especially if he values state sovereignty.\n\nLet me think about this differently. I recall that Wellman has written a book called \"Immigration and Freedom,\" where he argues that states have a right to control their borders based on the idea of self-ownership and state sovereignty. So, that seems to align with option D.\n\nBut let me double-check. If he believes in self-ownership, that means individuals own themselves and have rights over their own lives. Similarly, states as collectives might have sovereignty over their territory. So, they should be able to decide who enters their territory.\n\nWait, but option C suggests an obligation to admit the least well-off immigrants. That seems to contradict the idea of state sovereignty over immigration policies. If states have the right to control their borders, they should be able to set their own criteria for immigration, not necessarily prioritize the least well-off.\n\nOption B claims that closing borders is inherently racist. But if Wellman believes in state sovereignty and the right to control borders, he wouldn't agree with that, because he'd see it as a legitimate policy based on non-racial grounds.\n\nOption A says that anti-egalitarianism is compatible with liberal cosmopolitanism. I'm not sure about this one. Liberal cosmopolitanism might advocate for global equality or equal treatment of all people regardless of nationality. Anti-egalitarianism would oppose equality, perhaps emphasizing differences or hierarchies. It's hard to see how those two positions could be compatible.\n\nMaybe I should look up some of Wellman's key arguments. I remember that he uses the concept of self-ownership to argue that individuals have the right to freedom of movement, but also that states have the right to control their borders. He seems to balance individual rights with state rights.\n\nSo, if he believes that states have the right to control their borders, that aligns with option D: nation-states have a presumptive right to close their borders to all potential immigrants.\n\nBut let me see if there's more to it. Is he only defending the right to close borders, or does he think that states should have the obligation to open borders under certain conditions, like option C suggests?\n\nI don't think so. From what I recall, he's more about defending the right to control borders, not imposing obligations to admit certain immigrants.\n\nLet me consider if there's any context or specific arguments he makes that might align with the other options.\n\nFor option A, compatibility between anti-egalitarianism and liberal cosmopolitanism, I'm still unsure. Liberal cosmopolitanism seems to promote equality across borders, while anti-egalitarianism opposes equality. It's difficult to see how they could coexist.\n\nOption B, saying that closing borders is inherently racist, seems too strong. Wellman, who defends the right to control borders, wouldn't agree with that characterization.\n\nOption C, obligating states to admit the least well-off immigrants, seems altruistic but not necessarily in line with Wellman's emphasis on state sovereignty.\n\nOption D seems the most straightforward based on his known positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he has a more nuanced view that combines elements of these options. But based on the information I have, option D seems the most accurate representation of his position.\n\nSo, my answer would be D. Nation-states have a presumptive right to close their borders to all potential immigrants.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
