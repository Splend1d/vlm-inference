                    "text": "So I've got this passage from Ibn Battuta, who was a traveler and writer from the 14th century. He's talking about his experiences in China, specifically in Hangzhou, and mentions various groups of people there, like Muslims, Jews, Christians, and others. He also refers to the King of China being a Tartar, which I believe refers to the Yuan dynasty, which was established by the Mongols, descendants of Genghis Khan.\n\nThe question is asking which conclusion about the period from 600 C.E. to 1450 C.E. is most directly supported by this passage. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that long-distance contact between civilizations stagnated. But from what I know, during this period, especially with the rise of empires like the Mongols, there was actually increased contact between civilizations due to improved trade routes, like the Silk Road. Ibn Battuta's travels themselves suggest that people were moving around and experiencing different cultures, which doesn't sound like stagnation. So, I think this option is probably not supported by the passage.\n\nOption B suggests that new religious traditions overturned prior lasting religious beliefs. The passage mentions that the Chinese worship images and burn their dead, which is similar to Hindus, and also notes the presence of Muslims, Jews, Christians, and others in Hangzhou. However, it doesn't provide evidence that any of these new religious traditions were overthrowing existing beliefs. In fact, it seems like multiple religions coexisted peacefully there, at least from what's described. So, I don't think this option is strongly supported by the passage.\n\nOption C states that the empires of steppe nomads united trade links across Eurasia. Ibn Battuta mentions that the King of China is a Tartar, descended from Genghis Khan, which refers to the Mongol Empire. The Mongols were known for unifying large parts of Eurasia and facilitating trade and communication across their empire. The fact that Ibn Battuta, a Moroccan, could travel to China and find communities of Muslims and other groups suggests that there were established trade and cultural links supported by the Mongol rule. This seems directly supported by the passage.\n\nOption D mentions that technological developments spread across trade routes. While it's true that technologies like printing, gunpowder, and compasses spread from China to the West during this period, the passage doesn't directly mention any technological transfers. It focuses more on the social and religious composition of Hangzhou and the presence of different communities.\n\nBased on this analysis, I think option C is the most directly supported by the passage. It clearly refers to the role of steppe nomads, specifically the Mongols, in uniting trade links across Eurasia, which is consistent with the historical context and the details provided by Ibn Battuta.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
