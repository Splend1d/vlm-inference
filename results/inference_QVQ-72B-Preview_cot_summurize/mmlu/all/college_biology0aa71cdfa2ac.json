                    "text": "So I've got this question here about which group of animals first developed lungs that were good enough to support their breathing needs without any extra help from other organs. The options are amphibians, reptiles, mammals, or trematoda. Hmm, trematoda sounds familiar; I think they're a type of worm, like flukes. But they don't have lungs, do they? Maybe I should start by eliminating that one.\n\nAlright, so trematodes are parasites, and they don't have a respiratory system as such. They rely on diffusion for gas exchange, so they definitely don't have lungs. So, option D, trematoda, is probably out.\n\nNow, between amphibians, reptiles, and mammals, which one was the first to develop lungs that could fully support their respiratory needs without additional help?\n\nI know that amphibians have lungs, but I recall that their lungs aren't very efficient. For example, frogs have thin skin that they also use for gas exchange. So, in amphibians, it's not just the lungs doing the work; their skin plays a role too, especially when they're in water.\n\nReptiles, on the other hand, are fully terrestrial, and they have more developed lungs. I think their lungs are better at extracting oxygen from the air compared to amphibians. Also, reptiles have a more efficient circulatory system, which might support better respiratory function.\n\nMammals come after reptiles in the evolutionary timeline, and their lungs are even more complex and efficient, with alveoli that increase the surface area for gas exchange. But the question is about which group first developed adequate lungs without supplementary organs, so probably reptiles came before mammals.\n\nBut let me double-check. Amphibians have lungs, but they also rely on their skin and sometimes the lining of their mouths for gas exchange, especially during certain life stages like tadpoles being aquatic.\n\nReptiles are all terrestrial as adults, and their lungs are better adapted for aerial respiration. They don't rely on other organs for gas exchange in the same way amphibians do.\n\nSo, would that make reptiles the first group to have adequate lungs without needing supplementary gas exchange organs?\n\nWait a minute, what about birds? Birds are reptiles, right? Or are they considered a separate class? Actually, birds are considered a class of their own, Aves, which is a subgroup of reptiles. But in any case, birds have highly efficient respiratory systems with air sacs and everything, but again, that's within the reptile lineage.\n\nBut the question is about the first group to develop adequate lungs, so likely it's reptiles.\n\nLet me see if there's any other information I can recall. In amphibians, even though they have lungs, these lungs are simple sacs with limited surface area, whereas reptiles have more complex lungs with multiple lobes and better blood flow.\n\nAlso, amphibians often need to stay near water because their skin can dry out, whereas reptiles have scaly skin that prevents water loss, allowing them to live in drier environments, which might relate to their more efficient respiratory system.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like reptiles were the first to have lungs sufficient for their respiratory needs without relying on supplementary gas exchange organs.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the first groups of animals to develop lung tissue adequate to support their respiratory requirements without the use of supplementary gas exchange organs were the...\"\n\nAnd the options are amphibians, reptiles, mammals, or trematoda.\n\nGiven that trematoda is out, and amphibians use supplementary gas exchange through their skin, that leaves reptiles and mammals.\n\nBut since reptiles evolved before mammals, and their lungs are more developed than those of amphibians, it's likely that reptiles were the first to have adequate lungs without needing supplementary organs.\n\nMoreover, mammals, although they have even more efficient lungs, came after reptiles in evolutionary history, so reptiles would be the first group to have met this criterion.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. reptiles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
