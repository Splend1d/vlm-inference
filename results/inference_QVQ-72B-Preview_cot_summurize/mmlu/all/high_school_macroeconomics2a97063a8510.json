                    "text": "Let's see. So, if the inflation rate is expected to increase in the immediate future, what should I expect to happen?\n\nFirst, option A says consumers will begin saving more now. Hmm, but if inflation is expected to rise, that means prices are going to go up soon. So, wouldn't it make sense for consumers to buy things now before they get more expensive later? That sounds like they might spend more now rather than save. So, maybe A is not correct.\n\nOption B says the velocity of money will fall. Velocity of money is how fast money circulates in the economy. If inflation is expected to rise, people might try to spend their money faster to avoid losing value due to inflation. So, that would mean velocity increases, right? Not decreases. So, B seems incorrect.\n\nOption C says this will put upward pressure on the nominal interest rate. Okay, so if inflation expectations rise, lenders might demand higher interest rates to compensate for the loss of purchasing power of the money they lend. That makes sense. So, C seems plausible.\n\nOption D says this will put downward pressure on the real interest rate. Real interest rate is the nominal interest rate adjusted for inflation. So, if nominal rates go up because of higher inflation expectations, but inflation itself is also going up, the real interest rate might not necessarily go down. It depends on how much the nominal rate increases relative to inflation. If the nominal rate increases by less than the increase in inflation, then real rates would decrease. But, it's possible that the nominal rate increases by more than inflation, in which case real rates would increase. So, without knowing the exact magnitude, it's hard to say for sure. Maybe D could be a possibility, but C seems more straightforward.\n\nWait, but in the Fisher equation, the nominal interest rate is equal to the real interest rate plus the inflation rate. So, if inflation increases, and assuming the real interest rate stays the same, then the nominal interest rate should increase. That supports option C.\n\nBut, in reality, if inflation increases, the central bank might raise interest rates to control inflation, which would also lead to higher nominal rates. So, again, that points to C being correct.\n\nOption D suggests downward pressure on the real interest rate, but unless there's a specific reason to think that the nominal rate would increase by less than inflation, I don't think that's necessarily the case. Maybe in some scenarios, but generally, if inflation increases, nominal rates increase, and real rates might stay the same or change depending on monetary policy.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the most straightforward answer is C: this will put upward pressure on the nominal interest rate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
