                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this set of scores: 70, 70, 80, 80, 60, 60, 50, 90, 90, 90. And I need to find the mode. The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a set of numbers, right? So, I need to look for the number that shows up the most times.\n\nLet me list out the numbers again to visualize this:\n\n50, 60, 60, 70, 70, 80, 80, 90, 90, 90.\n\nOkay, so 50 appears once, 60 appears twice, 70 appears twice, 80 appears twice, and 90 appears three times. So, 90 shows up the most times.\n\nWait, but let's double-check that. Maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing.\n\nFirst, I should make sure I understand what the mode is. The mode is simply the number that appears most frequently in a data set. It's possible to have more than one mode if multiple numbers appear the same highest frequency, but in this case, it seems like 90 appears more times than the others.\n\nLet me count the frequency of each number:\n\n- 50: 1 time\n\n- 60: 2 times\n\n- 70: 2 times\n\n- 80: 2 times\n\n- 90: 3 times\n\nYes, clearly 90 appears the most times, which is three times. So, the mode should be 90.\n\nWait a minute, the options are:\n\nA. 74\n\nB. 75\n\nC. 90\n\nD. 40\n\nSo, among these, 90 is one of the options. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the data.\n\nIs there a possibility of multiple modes? In this case, since 90 appears three times and the others only two times, 90 is the only mode.\n\nMaybe I should consider the mean or median, but no, the question specifically asks for the mode.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the options, but assuming that's not the case, 90 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If I were to make a frequency distribution, it would look like this:\n\nScore | Frequency\n\n50 | 1\n\n60 | 2\n\n70 | 2\n\n80 | 2\n\n90 | 3\n\nSo, the highest frequency is for 90, which confirms that 90 is the mode.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and unless there's some unusual definition of mode, 90 should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the context. The question mentions \"the following set of scores,\" and lists ten numbers. Is there a possibility that the set includes more scores that aren't listed? No, the user specifies the set as 70, 70, 80, 80, 60, 60, 50, 90, 90, 90.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing whether I notice that 90 appears three times, which is different from the other scores that appear only twice.\n\nIn any case, based on the given data, the mode is 90.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
