                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a botanist testing the mean petal length of flowers. The null hypothesis is that the mean petal length (\u03bc) is equal to 3.5 cm, and the alternative hypothesis is that it's greater than 3.5 cm. They took a random sample of 50 petals and found significant results at a 5% level of significance. Now, I need to figure out which statement about the confidence interval is true.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to have significant results at a 5% level. In hypothesis testing, if the p-value is less than the significance level (\u03b1 = 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis. So, in this case, since the results are significant at the 5% level, that means the p-value is less than 0.05, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis.\n\nNow, the question is about a confidence interval for the mean petal length. Confidence intervals give us an estimated range of values that likely contains the true population mean. The relationship between hypothesis tests and confidence intervals is important here. Specifically, if we reject the null hypothesis at a certain significance level, the hypothesized value (in this case, 3.5 cm) should not be within the corresponding confidence interval.\n\nWait, let's make that clearer. For a two-sided test, if we reject the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level, the hypothesized mean is not within the 95% confidence interval. However, in this problem, the alternative hypothesis is one-sided: Ha: \u03bc > 3.5 cm. So, it's a one-sided test.\n\nFor a one-sided test, the confidence interval would also be one-sided, or more accurately, the confidence interval would have one tail that's open. But in practice, we often construct two-sided confidence intervals and interpret them accordingly.\n\nHere, since the alternative hypothesis is Ha: \u03bc > 3.5, and the test is significant at the 5% level, that means that the sample mean is sufficiently above 3.5 cm to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nNow, the options are about a 90% confidence interval. Wait, why 90%? Typically, with a 5% significance level, the corresponding confidence interval would be 95%, because 100% - 5% = 95%. But here, the options mention a 90% confidence interval.\n\nHmm, maybe there's some confusion here. Let me think again.\n\nIn a one-sided test, the significance level corresponds to the upper or lower tail. If \u03b1 = 0.05 for a one-sided test, then the confidence interval would be 100% - \u03b1 = 95%. So, rejecting the null hypothesis at \u03b1 = 0.05 corresponds to the hypothesized mean not being in the 95% confidence interval.\n\nBut the options mention a 90% confidence interval. Maybe there's a different relationship here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the significance level and the confidence level aren't directly related in this way for one-sided tests. Let me recall the relationship between hypothesis testing and confidence intervals more carefully.\n\nFor a one-sample t-test with a one-sided alternative, rejecting the null hypothesis at level \u03b1 corresponds to not including the null value in the (1 - 2\u03b1) confidence interval. Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nLet me look this up. I think for a one-sided test, rejecting the null at level \u03b1 corresponds to having the hypothesized value excluded from the (1 - \u03b1) confidence interval.\n\nFor example, if we have Ha: \u03bc > \u03bc0 and we reject the null at \u03b1 = 0.05, then \u03bc0 is less than the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nWait, no. Actually, for a one-sided test with Ha: \u03bc > \u03bc0, rejecting the null at \u03b1 = 0.05 means that the lower 95% confidence limit is greater than \u03bc0.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. Maybe I should think in terms of the p-value.\n\nGiven that the p-value is less than 0.05, which is the significance level, we reject the null hypothesis. So, the observed sample mean is sufficiently greater than 3.5 cm to conclude that the true mean is greater than 3.5 cm at the 5% significance level.\n\nNow, for a 90% confidence interval, the confidence coefficient is 0.90, which corresponds to a significance level of 0.10. Wait, but the test was performed at \u03b1 = 0.05.\n\nI think I need to relate the significance level of the test to the confidence level of the interval.\n\nIn general, for a one-sided test, the rejection region is in one tail. The confidence interval that corresponds to this test would be a one-sided confidence interval.\n\nBut the options are about a 90% confidence interval, which is typically two-sided.\n\nPerhaps the key here is to recognize that if we reject the null hypothesis at \u03b1 = 0.05 in a one-sided test, the hypothesized value is not within the corresponding (1 - \u03b1) = 0.95 confidence interval.\n\nBut the options mention a 90% confidence interval, which is different.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different relationship here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the confidence interval that corresponds to the significance level of the test.\n\nIn practice, for a one-sided t-test at \u03b1 = 0.05, the corresponding confidence interval would be a one-sided 95% confidence interval.\n\nBut the options are about a 90% confidence interval, which is different.\n\nMaybe I need to think about the relationship between the p-value and the confidence interval.\n\nIf the p-value is less than 0.05, then the hypothesized mean is not within the 95% confidence interval.\n\nBut again, the options mention a 90% confidence interval.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me try another approach.\n\nSuppose we have a sample mean that leads us to reject the null hypothesis that \u03bc = 3.5 cm in favor of \u03bc > 3.5 cm at the 5% significance level.\n\nThis means that the sample mean is sufficiently above 3.5 cm to conclude that the true mean is greater than 3.5 cm.\n\nNow, considering a 90% confidence interval for the mean petal length, what can we say about whether 3.5 cm is within this interval?\n\nA 90% confidence interval would exclude more values than a 95% interval, since it's narrower.\n\nGiven that the test was significant at 5%, which corresponds to a 95% confidence interval excluding the null value, it's likely that a 90% confidence interval would also exclude the null value, but I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 90% confidence interval would include values closer to the null value.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the relationship between the confidence level and the significance level more carefully.\n\nIn hypothesis testing, the significance level \u03b1 is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it's true, and the confidence level is 1 - \u03b1 for a two-sided interval.\n\nBut in this case, it's a one-sided test.\n\nLet me look up the relationship between one-sided tests and confidence intervals.\n\nUpon checking, for a one-sided test with Ha: \u03bc > \u03bc0, rejecting the null at level \u03b1 corresponds to the lower limit of the (1 - \u03b1) confidence interval being greater than \u03bc0.\n\nSo, in this problem, if we reject H0: \u03bc = 3.5 in favor of Ha: \u03bc > 3.5 at \u03b1 = 0.05, then 3.5 is less than the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nBut the options are about a 90% confidence interval.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose we have a one-sided test with Ha: \u03bc > \u03bc0, and we reject the null at \u03b1 = 0.05.\n\nThis means that the sample mean is sufficiently above \u03bc0 to conclude that \u03bc > \u03bc0.\n\nNow, a 90% confidence interval for \u03bc would exclude more values than a 95% interval, meaning that the interval would be narrower.\n\nGiven that the test was significant at \u03b1 = 0.05, which corresponds to the sample mean being above 3.5 cm, it's likely that 3.5 cm is not within the 90% confidence interval.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement would be that 3.5 cm is not within a 90% confidence interval.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The specified mean length of 3.5 cm is within a 90 percent confidence interval.\n\nB. The specified mean length of 3.5 cm is not within a 90 percent confidence interval.\n\nC. The specified mean length of 3.5 cm is below the lower limit of a 90 percent confidence interval.\n\nD. The specified mean length of 3.5 cm is below the lower limit of a 95 percent confidence interval.\n\nGiven my reasoning, option B seems correct because 3.5 cm is not within the 90% confidence interval.\n\nBut let's verify this further.\n\nConsider that for a one-sided test with Ha: \u03bc > \u03bc0, rejecting the null at \u03b1 = 0.05 means that the lower 95% confidence limit is greater than \u03bc0.\n\nSimilarly, a 90% confidence interval would be narrower, so the lower limit would be higher than in a 95% interval.\n\nSince the sample mean is already significantly above 3.5 cm, it's reasonable to conclude that 3.5 cm is below the lower limit of the 90% confidence interval.\n\nWait, but option C says \"the specified mean length of 3.5 cm is below the lower limit of a 90 percent confidence interval.\"\n\nThis seems plausible because, in this one-sided test, the confidence interval would have a lower limit, and since the sample mean is above 3.5 cm, 3.5 cm would be below the lower limit.\n\nBut option B says \"not within a 90 percent confidence interval,\" which would also be true if 3.5 cm is below the lower limit.\n\nHowever, option C is more specific, indicating that 3.5 cm is below the lower limit.\n\nI need to determine which one is more accurate.\n\nLet me consider that in a one-sided confidence interval for Ha: \u03bc > \u03bc0, the interval would have a lower limit but no upper limit (or the upper limit is infinite).\n\nSo, if we reject the null hypothesis, the lower limit of the confidence interval would be greater than \u03bc0.\n\nTherefore, 3.5 cm would be below the lower limit of the 90% confidence interval.\n\nSo, option C seems to be the most accurate statement.\n\nBut wait, option D mentions a 95% confidence interval, which might also be relevant.\n\nOption D says \"the specified mean length of 3.5 cm is below the lower limit of a 95 percent confidence interval.\"\n\nGiven that the test was significant at the 5% level, which corresponds to a 95% confidence interval excluding the null value, it's possible that 3.5 cm is below the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that the results are significant at the 5% level, which corresponds to a 95% confidence interval, but the options mention a 90% confidence interval.\n\nThis is confusing again.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the relationship between the significance level and the confidence level more carefully.\n\nIn general, for a one-sided test with Ha: \u03bc > \u03bc0, rejecting the null at level \u03b1 means that \u03bc0 is less than the lower limit of the (1 - \u03b1) confidence interval.\n\nSo, in this case, \u03b1 = 0.05, so (1 - \u03b1) = 0.95, which corresponds to a 95% confidence interval.\n\nTherefore, if we reject the null at \u03b1 = 0.05, then \u03bc0 is less than the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nBut the options mention a 90% confidence interval, which is different.\n\nOption D says that 3.5 cm is below the lower limit of a 95% confidence interval, which aligns with the above statement.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the results are significant at the 5% level, which corresponds to rejecting the null hypothesis in favor of \u03bc > 3.5 cm.\n\nTherefore, 3.5 cm is below the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nBut the options mention a 90% confidence interval, not 95%.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nLet me consider the relationship between the p-value and the confidence interval.\n\nIf the p-value is less than \u03b1, then the hypothesized value is not within the (1 - \u03b1) confidence interval.\n\nGiven that the test is significant at \u03b1 = 0.05, meaning p < 0.05, the hypothesized value (3.5 cm) is not within the 95% confidence interval.\n\nBut the options mention a 90% confidence interval, which is different.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about the confidence interval that corresponds to the significance level of the test.\n\nIn hypothesis testing, the confidence level corresponding to the significance level \u03b1 is (1 - \u03b1).\n\nSo, for \u03b1 = 0.05, the confidence level is 95%.\n\nBut the options mention a 90% confidence interval, which corresponds to \u03b1 = 0.10.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that there might be a misunderstanding in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 90% confidence interval is being used to make a decision about the hypothesis test, but that seems unlikely.\n\nLet me consider the properties of confidence intervals.\n\nA 90% confidence interval for \u03bc would exclude more values than a 95% interval because it's narrower.\n\nGiven that the test was significant at \u03b1 = 0.05, meaning that the sample mean is sufficiently above 3.5 cm to reject the null hypothesis, it's likely that 3.5 cm is not within the 90% confidence interval.\n\nTherefore, option B (\"the specified mean length of 3.5 cm is not within a 90 percent confidence interval\") is true.\n\nMoreover, since it's a one-sided test with Ha: \u03bc > 3.5 cm, and the sample mean is above 3.5 cm, leading to rejection of the null hypothesis, the lower limit of the 90% confidence interval would be greater than 3.5 cm.\n\nTherefore, 3.5 cm is below the lower limit of the 90% confidence interval, which aligns with option C.\n\nHowever, option D mentions a 95% confidence interval, which directly corresponds to the significance level of the test.\n\nGiven that the test is significant at \u03b1 = 0.05, the hypothesized value (3.5 cm) should be below the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nTherefore, option D is also true.\n\nBut the problem asks about a 90% confidence interval, not 95%.\n\nGiven that, and considering that a 90% confidence interval is narrower than a 95% interval, it's still the case that 3.5 cm is below the lower limit of the 90% confidence interval.\n\nTherefore, option C is true.\n\nOption B is also true because 3.5 cm is not within the 90% confidence interval.\n\nHowever, option C is more specific, indicating that 3.5 cm is below the lower limit.\n\nOption D refers to a 95% confidence interval, which is also true, but the question specifies a 90% confidence interval.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: the specified mean length of 3.5 cm is below the lower limit of a 90 percent confidence interval.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
