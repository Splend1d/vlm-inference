                    "text": "Alright, I've got this logic problem to translate into predicate logic: \"Caroline is sweet if, and only if, Janet is engaged to Brad.\" So, I need to find which option correctly represents this statement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"if, and only if\" means in logical terms. I remember that \"if, and only if\" is a logical biconditional. It means that both statements imply each other. So, if Caroline is sweet, then Janet is engaged to Brad, and conversely, if Janet is engaged to Brad, then Caroline is sweet.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Cs \u2283 Ej\n\nThis looks like a conditional statement, where Cs is \"Caroline is sweet\" and Ej is \"Janet is engaged.\" The symbol \"\u2283\" represents \"implies.\" So, this would mean \"Caroline is sweet implies Janet is engaged to Brad.\" But wait, the original statement is \"if, and only if,\" which requires both implications, not just one. So, this seems incomplete.\n\nB. Sc \u2261 Ej\n\nHere, \"Sc\" is \"sweet Caroline,\" which seems similar to Cs in option A, but it's written as Sc. The \"\u2261\" symbol represents logical equivalence, or \"if and only if.\" So, this option is saying \"sweet Caroline if and only if Janet is engaged to Brad.\" But I need to make sure that the variables are consistent. In option A, it's Cs and Ej, here it's Sc and Ej. Maybe the letters are just abbreviations, but I need to be consistent.\n\nC. sC \u2261 eJ\n\nThis option has \"sC\" and \"eJ,\" which might stand for \"sweet Caroline\" and \"engaged Janet.\" Again, \"\u2261\" is \"if and only if.\" This seems similar to option B but with different variable assignments.\n\nD. Sx \u2261 Jy\n\nThis option uses Sx and Jy, which might represent \"sweet x\" and \"Janed y\" or something similar. It's also using \"\u2261\" for \"if and only if.\"\n\nGiven that, I need to choose the option that best represents \"Caroline is sweet if, and only if, Janet is engaged to Brad.\"\n\nFirst, I need to identify how \"Caroline is sweet\" and \"Janet is engaged to Brad\" are represented.\n\nIn predicate logic, we typically use predicates followed by variables. For example, S(c) might mean \"Caroline is sweet,\" where S is the predicate for sweetness and c is the constant for Caroline.\n\nSimilarly, E(j, b) might mean \"Janet is engaged to Brad,\" where E is the predicate for being engaged, and j and b are constants for Janet and Brad.\n\nHowever, in these options, they've abbreviated them differently. Let's try to decode them.\n\nOption A: Cs \u2283 Ej\n\nHere, Cs likely means C is sweet, where C is Caroline, and s is sweet. Similarly, Ej might be E is engaged, where E is Janet, and j is Brad. But the symbols are a bit confusing.\n\nOption B: Sc \u2261 Ej\n\nSc might be S is Caroline, but that doesn't make much sense. Maybe S(c), where S is sweet and c is Caroline. Ej again seems similar to option A.\n\nOption C: sC \u2261 eJ\n\nsC might be sweet Caroline, and eJ might be engaged Janet. This seems a bit inconsistent because it's mixing lowercase and uppercase.\n\nOption D: Sx \u2261 Jy\n\nSx could be sweet x, and Jy could be Janet is y, but that doesn't fit well.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the most straightforward interpretation is:\n\nIf C is Caroline, S is sweet, E is engaged, J is Janet, and b is Brad, then:\n\n- Cs would be S(c), meaning Caroline is sweet.\n\n- Ej would be E(j,b), meaning Janet is engaged to Brad.\n\nSo, option A would be Cs \u2283 Ej, which is \"Caroline is sweet implies Janet is engaged to Brad,\" but that's only one direction, not \"if and only if.\"\n\nOption B: Sc \u2261 Ej\n\nIf Sc is S(c), which is Caroline is sweet, and Ej is E(j,b), then this would be S(c) \u2261 E(j,b), which is \"Caroline is sweet if and only if Janet is engaged to Brad.\" This seems correct.\n\nOption C: sC \u2261 eJ\n\nThis seems similar to Sc and Ej, but the notation is different. It might be trying to say sweet Caroline and engaged Janet, but it's not clear.\n\nOption D: Sx \u2261 Jy\n\nThis seems like a general statement, possibly \"x is sweet if and only if y is Janet,\" which doesn't match the original statement.\n\nGiven that, option B seems to be the closest to the correct translation: Sc \u2261 Ej, where Sc is Caroline is sweet and Ej is Janet is engaged to Brad.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that the variables are correctly assigned. In standard predicate logic, we'd write it as S(c) \u2261 E(j,b), assuming c is Caroline, j is Janet, and b is Brad.\n\nBut in the options provided, they've abbreviated it as Sc and Ej. Assuming that Sc stands for S(c) and Ej stands for E(j,b), then option B would be correct.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because in logic, Sc could be interpreted as S(c), but Ej could be E(j) or E(j,b). If E is a binary predicate meaning \"x is engaged to y,\" then E(j,b) would be \"Janet is engaged to Brad.\"\n\nGiven that, option B seems to be the best choice.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write this myself, I'd probably use:\n\nS(c) \u2261 E(j,b)\n\nBut since that's not an option, and assuming that Sc is S(c) and Ej is E(j,b), then option B is the correct one.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider that E is a unary predicate meaning \"x is engaged,\" and we'd need another predicate for \"x is engaged to y.\" So, perhaps E(j) means Janet is engaged, but we need to specify to whom she's engaged.\n\nIn that case, if E(j) means Janet is engaged, and we don't specify to Brad, then it's not capturing the full original statement.\n\nSimilarly, in option B, Ej might be E(j), meaning Janet is engaged, but that's not enough because the original statement specifies \"engaged to Brad.\"\n\nSo, perhaps none of the options are perfectly accurate, but we have to choose the best one.\n\nGiven that, option B seems to be the closest, assuming that Ej represents E(j,b), even though it's written as Ej.\n\nAlternatively, maybe E is a binary predicate, and Ej represents E(j,b), with b being Brad implicitly.\n\nBut that seems unclear.\n\nOption C: sC \u2261 eJ\n\nThis seems like sweet Caroline and engaged Janet, but again, it's not clear if eJ means E(j) or E(j,b).\n\nOption D: Sx \u2261 Jy\n\nThis seems like a general statement about x and y, which doesn't fit the specific individuals Caroline, Janet, and Brad.\n\nTherefore, option B is the most straightforward interpretation, assuming Sc is S(c) and Ej is E(j,b).\n\nSo, my final answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
