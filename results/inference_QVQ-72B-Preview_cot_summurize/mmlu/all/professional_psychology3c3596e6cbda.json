                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about the facets of primary prevention. The options are:\n\nA. Primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention\n\nB. Primary, universal, and indicative\n\nC. Universal, selective, and indicative\n\nD. None of the above\n\nHmm, I need to recall what primary prevention is and what its facets are. I know that primary prevention is about stopping health problems before they start. It's like taking steps to prevent a disease or injury from occurring in the first place. Things like eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and not smoking are examples of primary prevention.\n\nNow, looking at the options, option A mentions primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. I remember that these are different levels of prevention:\n\n- Primary prevention: stopping a disease before it starts.\n\n- Secondary prevention: detecting and treating a disease early on, before it causes serious harm.\n\n- Tertiary prevention: managing a disease to prevent complications and further progression.\n\nSo, primary prevention is one facet, but secondary and tertiary are separate concepts. So, option A doesn't seem to be the correct answer.\n\nOption B says primary, universal, and indicative. This seems a bit confusing. Primary is already mentioned, and then universal and indicative. I'm not sure what \"indicative\" refers to in this context. Maybe it's a typo or something, because I don't recall \"indicative\" being a standard term in prevention strategies.\n\nOption C is universal, selective, and indicative. Again, \"indicative\" seems out of place. I think there might be a mistake here because in health promotion, the facets of primary prevention are often discussed in terms of universal, selective, and indicated prevention.\n\nWait a minute, maybe \"indicative\" is supposed to be \"indicated.\" That makes more sense. Let me check.\n\nYes, in many texts, primary prevention is divided into three types:\n\n1. Universal prevention: strategies that are applied to the entire population, regardless of risk. Examples include public health campaigns, environmental changes, or laws that promote health and safety for everyone.\n\n2. Selective prevention: targeted at individuals or groups who have a higher risk of developing a particular health problem due to specific risk factors. For example, offering smoking cessation programs to smokers or providing dietary counseling to people with a family history of heart disease.\n\n3. Indicated prevention: aimed at individuals who show early signs or symptoms of a health problem but haven't yet developed the full-blown disease. This is sometimes considered part of secondary prevention, but in some models, it's still seen as a facet of primary prevention.\n\nGiven that, option C might be correct if \"indicative\" is meant to be \"indicated.\" But since it's written as \"indicative,\" I'm unsure.\n\nOption D is \"none of the above,\" which seems unlikely because the other options seem to be related to prevention models.\n\nI think the correct answer should be C, but with \"indicative\" corrected to \"indicated.\" Since that's not the case, perhaps the question has an error.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to test knowledge of different prevention models, and the answer is B, but that seems incomplete.\n\nWait, perhaps the facets of primary prevention are universal, selective, and indicated prevention, which would correspond to option C if \"indicative\" is a typo for \"indicated.\"\n\nGiven that, I'll go with option C as the correct answer, assuming \"indicative\" is a mistake and should be \"indicated.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
