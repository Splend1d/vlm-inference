                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which statement about a remote procedure call (RPC) is true. I have four options here, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that RPC is used to call procedures with addresses that are farther than 2^16 bytes away. Hmm, that seems a bit technical. I remember that 2^16 is 65,536 bytes, which is the range of a 16-bit address. So, is RPC about calling procedures that are beyond that address range? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe RPC is more about calling procedures on a different computer, not necessarily about address ranges.\n\nOption B says that RPC cannot return a value. That doesn't sound right. When you call a procedure or a function, one of the main things it does is return a value or result back to the caller. I think RPCs can return values; otherwise, they wouldn't be very useful. Maybe there are some limitations, but generally, I'd expect them to be able to return values.\n\nOption C says that RPC cannot pass parameters by reference. Passing parameters by reference means that the called procedure can modify the data in the caller's variables directly. I think RPC can pass parameters by reference, especially in languages that support it. Again, there might be some constraints, but generally, it should be possible.\n\nOption D says that RPC cannot call procedures implemented in a different language. This one seems plausible. RPC is typically used across different systems or languages, right? One of the main purposes of RPC is to allow different systems, possibly written in different programming languages, to communicate and call procedures on each other. So, saying that RPC cannot call procedures in different languages seems counterintuitive.\n\nLet me summarize my thoughts:\n\n- Option A: RPC is for calling procedures beyond a certain address range. Not sure if that's the main purpose.\n\n- Option B: RPC cannot return a value. I think it can.\n\n- Option C: RPC cannot pass parameters by reference. I think it can.\n\n- Option D: RPC cannot call procedures in different languages. I think it can.\n\nI need to find the correct statement, which is the one that is true. Based on my reasoning, it seems like none of these options are necessarily true. But since the question asks for the true statement, one of them must be correct.\n\nMaybe I need to look at RPC from a different angle. RPC is a mechanism that allows a computer program to cause a procedure or subroutine to be executed in another address space (such as on another computer) without the programmer explicitly coding the details of this interaction. So, it's more about the abstraction of calling a procedure as if it were local, even though it's remote.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option A is incorrect because RPC isn't specifically about address ranges; it's about crossing system boundaries. Similarly, options B and C might be incorrect because RPC should be able to return values and pass parameters by reference, depending on the implementation.\n\nOption D seems intriguing. Maybe RPC can only call procedures in the same language, but that doesn't make much sense because RPC is often used for inter-language and inter-platform communication.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I need to consider that RPC can indeed call procedures in different languages, but there might be some limitations or requirements for interoperability. For example, different languages might have different ways of handling data types, so there might need to be some standardization or marshaling of data when crossing language boundaries.\n\nMaybe the correct answer is none of the above, but since I have to choose one, I need to pick the one that is most likely to be true.\n\nLet me consider option A again. In computing, a 16-bit address can address up to 64KB of memory. So, if a procedure is beyond that range, how would you call it? Well, in modern systems, addresses are usually 32-bit or 64-bit, so 16-bit addresses are quite limited and not commonly used anymore. Maybe in older systems, RPC was necessary to call procedures in remote addresses beyond the local address space. But that seems like a stretch.\n\nOption B: RPC cannot return a value. That seems fundamentally incorrect. The whole point of a procedure call is to execute some code and get a result back. RPC is designed to make remote procedure calls appear local, so not being able to return a value would be a significant limitation.\n\nOption C: RPC cannot pass parameters by reference. Again, passing parameters by reference is a common practice in programming, allowing procedures to modify the original data. RPC should support this, possibly through mechanisms like pointers or references.\n\nOption D: RPC cannot call procedures implemented in a different language. This seems unlikely because RPC is often used in heterogeneous environments where different systems and languages need to interoperate.\n\nPerhaps I need to think about the limitations of RPC. Are there any scenarios where RPC cannot return a value or pass parameters by reference? Maybe in certain implementations, but generally, RPC should support these features.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to test understanding of RPC's capabilities and limitations. If that's the case, then perhaps option A is correct because RPC is used to call procedures that are not within the local address space, i.e., beyond 64KB.\n\nBut wait, in modern computing, addresses are much larger, so that doesn't seem relevant.\n\nLet me try a different approach. I'll look up what RPC actually is and see which of these statements aligns with its definition.\n\nRemote Procedure Call (RPC) is a protocol that allows a computer program to cause a subroutine or procedure to be executed in another address space (commonly on another computer) without the programmer explicitly coding the details of this interaction.\n\nSo, RPC is primarily about executing procedures on remote systems as if they were local.\n\nGiven that, option A mentions addresses farther than 2^16 bytes away. Well, RPC is about crossing address spaces, not just exceeding a certain address range. So, this seems too specific and not necessarily accurate.\n\nOption B says RPC cannot return a value. That can't be right because RPC is designed to mimic local procedure calls, which do return values.\n\nOption C says RPC cannot pass parameters by reference. Again, RPC should support various parameter passing mechanisms, including by reference.\n\nOption D says RPC cannot call procedures implemented in a different language. This seems contrary to the purpose of RPC, which is to facilitate communication across different systems and potentially different languages.\n\nGiven all this, I'm leaning towards option A being the correct one, but with some doubts.\n\nWait, maybe I misread option A. It says RPC is used to call procedures with addresses that are farther than 2^16 bytes away. That is, it's used for remote procedures, not just procedures that are beyond a certain memory address in the same system.\n\nIn other words, if a procedure is too far away in memory (beyond 64KB), you might need to call it remotely via RPC. But this seems like a stretch because modern systems have much larger address spaces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to say that RPC is used when the procedure is not in the local address space, hence it's remote.\n\nBut that seems too simplistic. RPC is more about the abstraction of calling remote procedures as if they were local, regardless of the distance or address space.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer is probably option A, because RPC is used to call procedures that are not in the local address space, i.e., they are \"farther\" away.\n\nBut to confirm, let's consider that in a 16-bit address space, addresses range from 0 to 64KB. If a procedure is beyond that, say in another system, you would need to use RPC to call it.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, option A is stating a fact about RPC's purpose.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: It is used to call procedures with addresses that are farther than 2^16 bytes away.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
