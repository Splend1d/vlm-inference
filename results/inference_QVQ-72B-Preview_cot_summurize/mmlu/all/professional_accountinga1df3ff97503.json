                    "text": "So I have this problem here about calculating the net present value (NPV). Let's see what it's asking. There's an initial investment of $11,000, and then there are cash inflows of $3,000 at the end of each year for five years. The discount rate is 10%. I need to find the NPV from these cash flows.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what NPV is. NPV is the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows. In this case, the cash outflow is the initial investment, and the cash inflows are the annual payments received over five years.\n\nSo, NPV = Present Value of Inflows - Present Value of Outflows.\n\nThe present value of the initial investment is straightforward since it's already in present value terms. It's just $11,000.\n\nNow, for the cash inflows, each $3,000 payment is received at the end of each year for five years. To find the present value of these future cash flows, I need to discount each one back to today using the discount rate of 10%.\n\nI could calculate each year's $3,000 discounted back to present value and then sum them up. But there's probably a simpler way to do this, maybe using a formula for an annuity since these are equal payments over multiple periods.\n\nThe formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is:\n\nPV = P * [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r\n\nWhere:\n\n- P is the annual payment ($3,000)\n\n- r is the discount rate (10% or 0.10)\n\n- n is the number of periods (5 years)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nPV = $3,000 * [1 - (1 + 0.10)^-5] / 0.10\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + 0.10)^-5:\n\nThat's (1.10)^-5. I think I can use the calculator for this.\n\n(1.10)^-5 = 1 / (1.10)^5\n\nFirst, calculate (1.10)^5:\n\n1.10 * 1.10 = 1.21\n\n1.21 * 1.10 = 1.331\n\n1.331 * 1.10 = 1.4641\n\n1.4641 * 1.10 = 1.61051\n\nSo, (1.10)^5 = 1.61051\n\nTherefore, (1.10)^-5 = 1 / 1.61051 \u2248 0.62092\n\nNow, plug that back into the formula:\n\nPV = $3,000 * [1 - 0.62092] / 0.10\n\nPV = $3,000 * [0.37908] / 0.10\n\nPV = $3,000 * 0.37908 / 0.10\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's double-check the formula.\n\nOh, no, the formula is PV = P * [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r\n\nSo, PV = $3,000 * (0.37908) / 0.10\n\nBecause [1 - 0.62092] is 0.37908\n\nThen, divide that by 0.10.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, $3,000 * 0.37908 = $1,137.24\n\nThen, $1,137.24 / 0.10 = $11,372.4\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me check my calculations.\n\nActually, no, the formula is PV = P * [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r\n\nWhich is PV = P * (annuity factor)\n\nSo, PV = $3,000 * (0.37908) / 0.10\n\nWait, no, the formula is PV = P * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n)/r]\n\nSo, PV = $3,000 * (0.37908)/0.10\n\nWait, that's not correct.\n\nLet me look up the formula again.\n\nYes, PV of an ordinary annuity is indeed PV = P * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n)/r]\n\nSo, PV = $3,000 * [1 - 0.62092]/0.10\n\nWhich is $3,000 * (0.37908)/0.10\n\nWait, no, because the formula is [1 - (1 + r)^-n]/r\n\nSo, it's $3,000 * (0.37908)/0.10\n\nWhich is $3,000 * 3.7908\n\nBecause 0.37908 / 0.10 = 3.7908\n\nSo, PV = $3,000 * 3.7908 \u2248 $11,372.4\n\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, NPV = PV of inflows - PV of outflows\n\nPV of outflows is the initial investment of $11,000\n\nPV of inflows is $11,372.4\n\nSo, NPV = $11,372.4 - $11,000 = $372.4\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. -$9,500\n\nB. $370\n\nC. $4,000\n\nD. $11,370\n\nThe closest option is B. $370. Maybe due to rounding, it's $370 instead of $372.4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating (1.10)^-5.\n\nLet me try calculating (1.10)^-5 more accurately.\n\n(1.10)^-5 = 1 / (1.10)^5\n\n(1.10)^5 = 1.10 * 1.10 * 1.10 * 1.10 * 1.10\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n1.10 * 1.10 = 1.21\n\n1.21 * 1.10 = 1.331\n\n1.331 * 1.10 = 1.4641\n\n1.4641 * 1.10 = 1.61051\n\nSo, (1.10)^5 = 1.61051\n\nTherefore, (1.10)^-5 = 1 / 1.61051 \u2248 0.62092\n\nThen, PV = $3,000 * (1 - 0.62092)/0.10\n\n1 - 0.62092 = 0.37908\n\n0.37908 / 0.10 = 3.7908\n\nSo, PV = $3,000 * 3.7908 \u2248 $11,372.4\n\nNPV = $11,372.4 - $11,000 = $372.4\n\nSo, the closest option is B. $370, which might be rounded down from $372.4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of (1.10)^-5.\n\nLet me see, (1.10)^5 is exactly 1.61051\n\nSo, (1.10)^-5 = 1 / 1.61051 \u2248 0.62092132075\n\nThen, PV = $3,000 * (1 - 0.62092132075)/0.10\n\n= $3,000 * (0.37907867925)/0.10\n\n= $3,000 * 3.7907867925\n\n= $11,372.3603775\n\nThen, NPV = $11,372.3603775 - $11,000 = $372.3603775\n\nWhich rounds to approximately $372.36\n\nSo, the closest option is B. $370, which is likely rounded down from $372.36.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. $370\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
