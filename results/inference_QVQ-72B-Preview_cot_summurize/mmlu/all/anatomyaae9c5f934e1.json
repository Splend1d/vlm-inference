These muscles work together to expand the chest cavity, allowing air to flow into the lungs. The internal intercostal muscles, on the other hand, are generally involved in expiration, particularly during forced exhalation.\n\nSo, among the given options:\n\nA. External and internal intercostal muscles\n\nB. External intercostal muscles and diaphragm\n\nC. Internal intercostal muscles and diaphragm\n\nD. External and internal intercostal muscles and diaphragm\n\nThe correct answer should be B. External intercostal muscles and diaphragm.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that the diaphragm is the main muscle of inspiration, and the external intercostals help by raising the ribs to expand the chest cavity. The internal intercostals are more involved in expiration by lowering the ribs. So, during quiet inspiration, it makes sense that the external intercostals and the diaphragm are the primary muscles at work.\n\nOption A includes both external and internal intercostals, but since internal intercostals are more for expiration, they probably aren't active during inspiration.\n\nOption C pairs internal intercostals with the diaphragm, which again, internal intercostals are for expiration, so that seems unlikely for inspiration.\n\nOption D includes all three, which seems excessive for quiet inspiration, as again, internal intercostals are for expiration.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer should be B. External intercostal muscles and diaphragm.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about it some more. In some sources, I've read that during quiet breathing, the diaphragm is the primary muscle of inspiration, and the external intercostals provide some assistance by elevating the ribs. However, sometimes, it's mentioned that the internal intercostals might have a role in inspiration as well, but generally, they are more active during expiration, especially in forced breathing.\n\nGiven that, I think the best answer is still B. External intercostal muscles and diaphragm.\n\nWait, but I've also heard of the scalene muscles and the serratus posterior superior being accessory muscles of inspiration. However, they are more active during forced inspiration, like during exercise or heavy lifting, not during quiet breathing.\n\nSo, sticking with my initial thought, the primary muscles active during quiet inspiration are the external intercostal muscles and the diaphragm.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all possible angles here, and I'm confident that option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
