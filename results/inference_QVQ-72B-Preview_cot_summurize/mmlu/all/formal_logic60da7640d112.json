                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to construct a truth table for the given argument and then determine if the argument is valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I have to pick the correct counterexample from the options provided.\n\nFirst, let's understand the argument. There are two propositions here: I and J. The argument consists of two premises and a conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: I is equivalent to not J (I \u2261 ~J)\n\n2. Premise 2: I or J (I \u2228 J)\n\nConclusion: I\n\nSo, the argument is: From I \u2261 ~J and I \u2228 J, conclude I.\n\nTo construct the truth table, I need to evaluate all possible truth values for I and J and then see if the conclusion follows from the premises in every row.\n\nLet's list all possible truth value combinations for I and J. Since there are two propositions, there are 2^2 = 4 possible combinations:\n\n1. I is true, J is true\n\n2. I is true, J is false\n\n3. I is false, J is true\n\n4. I is false, J is false\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the truth values of the premises and the conclusion for each of these combinations.\n\nStarting with the first premise: I \u2261 ~J. This is an equivalence, meaning that I and ~J are either both true or both false.\n\nThe second premise: I \u2228 J, which is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of I or J is true.\n\nThe conclusion: I, which is simply that I is true.\n\nI need to check, for each row, whether the premises entail the conclusion. In other words, in every row where both premises are true, is the conclusion also true? If there is even one row where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid. That row would be a counterexample.\n\nLet's construct the truth table row by row.\n\n**Row 1: I is true, J is true**\n\n- Premise 1: I \u2261 ~J\n\n- ~J is false (since J is true)\n\n- So, I \u2261 false\n\n- But I is true, so we have true \u2261 false, which is false.\n\n- Premise 2: I \u2228 J = true \u2228 true = true\n\n- Conclusion: I = true\n\n- In this row, premise 1 is false, so the argument is vacuously true here. We can ignore this row for determining validity because if a premise is false, the whole argument can't be evaluated.\n\n**Row 2: I is true, J is false**\n\n- Premise 1: I \u2261 ~J\n\n- ~J is true\n\n- So, I \u2261 true\n\n- I is true, so true \u2261 true, which is true.\n\n- Premise 2: I \u2228 J = true \u2228 false = true\n\n- Conclusion: I = true\n\n- Both premises are true, and the conclusion is true. So, the argument holds here.\n\n**Row 3: I is false, J is true**\n\n- Premise 1: I \u2261 ~J\n\n- ~J is false\n\n- So, I \u2261 false\n\n- I is false, so false \u2261 false, which is true.\n\n- Premise 2: I \u2228 J = false \u2228 true = true\n\n- Conclusion: I = false\n\n- Here, both premises are true, but the conclusion is false. This is a counterexample.\n\n**Row 4: I is false, J is false**\n\n- Premise 1: I \u2261 ~J\n\n- ~J is true\n\n- So, I \u2261 true\n\n- I is false, so false \u2261 true, which is false.\n\n- Premise 2: I \u2228 J = false \u2228 false = false\n\n- Conclusion: I = false\n\n- Both premises are false, so again, the argument is vacuously true.\n\nFrom the truth table, in row 3, both premises are true, but the conclusion is false. Therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nNow, I need to choose the correct option that presents a counterexample. The options are:\n\nA. Valid\n\nB. Invalid. Counterexample when I and J are true\n\nC. Invalid. Counterexample when I is true and J is false\n\nD. Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and I is false\n\nFrom my analysis, the counterexample is when I is false and J is true (row 3), which matches option D.\n\nWait a minute, option D says \"when J is true and I is false,\" which is the same as my row 3.\n\nOption B says \"when I and J are true,\" but in row 1, premise 1 is false, so that's not a valid counterexample.\n\nOption C says \"when I is true and J is false,\" but in row 2, both premises are true and the conclusion is true, so that's not a counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nLooking back at the truth table:\n\n- Row 1: I=true, J=true\n\n- Premise 1: false\n\n- Premise 2: true\n\n- Conclusion: true\n\n- Argument is vacuously true here.\n\n- Row 2: I=true, J=false\n\n- Premise 1: true\n\n- Premise 2: true\n\n- Conclusion: true\n\n- Argument holds.\n\n- Row 3: I=false, J=true\n\n- Premise 1: true\n\n- Premise 2: true\n\n- Conclusion: false\n\n- Counterexample.\n\n- Row 4: I=false, J=false\n\n- Premise 1: false\n\n- Premise 2: false\n\n- Conclusion: false\n\n- Again, vacuously true.\n\nSo, indeed, the only row where both premises are true and the conclusion is false is row 3, which corresponds to J true and I false.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\nWait, but option D says \"Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and I is false.\" That matches row 3.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, option D seems to be phrased as \"Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and I is false,\" which aligns with row 3.\n\nBut let's make sure about the phrasing. \"When J is true and I is false\" corresponds to row 3, where both premises are true and the conclusion is false, which is indeed a counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
