                    "text": "So I have this logic problem here. It says: \"The university raises tuition only if both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\" And I need to identify the antecedent of this conditional proposition. The options are:\n\nA. The university raises tuition.\n\nB. The governor approves of it.\n\nC. The board of trustees recommends it.\n\nD. The governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what a conditional proposition is and what an antecedent is. A conditional proposition is usually of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent. So, if I can rewrite the given statement in that form, it might help me identify the antecedent.\n\nThe statement says: \"The university raises tuition only if both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\"\n\nHmm, the phrase \"only if\" sounds similar to \"if,\" but I need to be careful. In logic, \"P only if Q\" is equivalent to \"If P, then Q.\" So, in this case, \"The university raises tuition only if both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it\" can be rephrased as \"If the university raises tuition, then both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\"\n\nSo, in the form \"If P, then Q,\" P is the antecedent, and Q is the consequent.\n\nFrom the rephrased statement: If the university raises tuition, then both the governor approves and the board recommends it.\n\nSo, P is \"the university raises tuition,\" and Q is \"both the governor approves and the board recommends it.\"\n\nWait a minute, that would suggest that P is option A and Q is option D. But the question is asking for the antecedent of the conditional proposition, which is P in \"If P, then Q.\"\n\nSo, according to this, the antecedent is \"the university raises tuition,\" which is option A.\n\nBut let me double-check because I want to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the logical structure. The original statement is: \"The university raises tuition only if both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\"\n\nIn logical terms, \"only if\" introduces the condition. So, \"P only if Q\" means that Q must be true whenever P is true, which translates to \"If P, then Q.\"\n\nTherefore, P is \"the university raises tuition,\" and Q is \"both the governor approves and the board recommends it.\"\n\nSo, again, the antecedent is P, which is option A.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption B: The governor approves of it.\n\nIs this the antecedent? Well, no, because in the conditional \"If the university raises tuition, then both the governor approves and the board recommends it,\" the governor's approval is part of the consequent, not the antecedent.\n\nOption C: The board of trustees recommends it.\n\nSimilarly, this is also part of the consequent in the conditional statement.\n\nOption D: The governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\n\nThis is the entire consequent of the conditional statement.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the correct antecedent is option A: The university raises tuition.\n\nWait, but I have a doubt here. Sometimes, people might confuse \"only if\" with \"if and only if,\" but in this case, the statement is clearly \"only if,\" which is different from \"if and only if.\"\n\nTo confirm, \"P only if Q\" is equivalent to \"If P, then Q,\" not \"If and only if.\"\n\nSo, my final answer is option A: The university raises tuition.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
