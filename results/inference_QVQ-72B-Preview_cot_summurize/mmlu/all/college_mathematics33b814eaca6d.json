                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 25 suitcases, and out of those, 5 are damaged. I need to find the probability that exactly 2 out of 3 randomly selected suitcases are damaged. Let's see, probability is generally about the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes. So, I need to figure out both the total number of ways to choose 3 suitcases and the number of ways to choose exactly 2 damaged ones.\n\nFirst, the total number of ways to choose 3 suitcases out of 25. That sounds like a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So, n = 25 and k = 3.\n\nCalculating that, C(25, 3) = 25! / (3! * 22!) = (25 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 23) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (13,800) / 6 = 2,300. So, there are 2,300 different ways to choose 3 suitcases out of 25.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of ways to choose exactly 2 damaged suitcases and 1 undamaged suitcase.\n\nThere are 5 damaged suitcases, and I need to choose 2 out of those. So, the number of ways to choose 2 damaged suitcases is C(5, 2).\n\nSimilarly, there are 20 undamaged suitcases (since 25 - 5 = 20), and I need to choose 1 out of those. So, the number of ways to choose 1 undamaged suitcase is C(20, 1).\n\nCalculating C(5, 2): C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * 3!) = (5 \u00d7 4) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 10.\n\nCalculating C(20, 1): C(20, 1) = 20.\n\nNow, to find the number of favorable outcomes, I multiply these two: 10 * 20 = 200.\n\nSo, there are 200 ways to choose exactly 2 damaged and 1 undamaged suitcase.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 200 / 2,300.\n\nSimplifying that fraction: both numerator and denominator can be divided by 10, so it becomes 20 / 230.\n\nSimplifying further, 20 \u00f7 10 = 2, and 230 \u00f7 10 = 23. So, the probability is 2/23.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 2/23 is one of them.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal number of ways to choose 3 suitcases out of 25: C(25, 3) = 2,300. That seems correct.\n\nNumber of ways to choose exactly 2 damaged and 1 undamaged: C(5, 2) * C(20, 1) = 10 * 20 = 200. That also seems correct.\n\nProbability: 200 / 2,300 = 2/23.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{23}} \\]"
