                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to figure out which one of these is the oldest permanent European settlement in the United States. The options are St. Augustine, Florida; Plymouth, Massachusetts; Newport News, Virginia; and Charlotte, North Carolina. Hmm, I think I remember something about St. Augustine being pretty old, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nFirst, let me consider St. Augustine. I think it was founded by the Spanish in the 16th century, maybe around 1565? That seems really early. If that's the case, it would make it one of the oldest European settlements in the U.S.\n\nNext, there's Plymouth, Massachusetts. I know that's where the Pilgrims landed, but I think that was in 1620. So, that's later than St. Augustine, right?\n\nThen, Newport News, Virginia. I'm not as familiar with this one. I know Virginia was one of the original thirteen colonies, but I think the settlement there was primarily around Jamestown, which was founded in 1607. Is Newport News related to Jamestown or is it a different settlement?\n\nLastly, Charlotte, North Carolina. I think Charlotte was founded much later, maybe in the 18th century or something like that.\n\nSo, if St. Augustine was founded in 1565, that would make it older than Plymouth (1620), and also older than Jamestown (1607). Wait, but Jamestown is in Virginia, and Newport News is also in Virginia. Maybe I need to check when Newport News was founded.\n\nLet me try to recall: Jamestown was founded in 1607, and then the Pilgrims landed in Plymouth in 1620. St. Augustine was founded in 1565, which is even earlier than Jamestown. As for Newport News, I think it was founded much later, maybe in the 17th or 18th century, but I'm not sure about the exact year.\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina, I believe was founded in the 1700s, maybe around 1768 or something like that.\n\nSo, comparing all these dates:\n\n- St. Augustine: 1565\n\n- Jamestown: 1607\n\n- Plymouth: 1620\n\n- Newport News: possibly 17th or 18th century\n\n- Charlotte: 1700s\n\nClearly, St. Augustine is the oldest among these options.\n\nWait a minute, but is there a possibility that Newport News was founded before 1607? I don't think so. I think Jamestown was the first permanent English settlement in Virginia, and Newport News is located near Jamestown but was likely settled later.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that St. Augustine was founded by the Spanish, while the others were founded by the English or other European powers.\n\nSo, based on this information, St. Augustine, Florida, seems to be the oldest permanent European settlement in the United States.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should confirm if there are any older settlements that might not be as well-known. For example, I've heard of Santa Fe, New Mexico, which was founded in 1609, which is still after St. Augustine.\n\nWhat about other settlements in the southeastern United States? I think St. Augustine is still the oldest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some French settlements in Louisiana or elsewhere, but I believe those were founded after St. Augustine as well.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to say that St. Augustine is the oldest permanent European settlement in the United States.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A.
