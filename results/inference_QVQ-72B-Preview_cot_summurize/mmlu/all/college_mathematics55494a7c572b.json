                    "text": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here. It says that a real number x is chosen at random in the interval [0, 3], and a real number y is chosen at random in the interval [0, 4]. I need to find the probability that x is less than y. The options are 1/2, 7/12, 5/8, and 2/3.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for x and y to be chosen at random from these intervals. Since x is from [0, 3] and y is from [0, 4], both are continuous uniform distributions. That means every value in their respective intervals has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nTo find the probability that x < y, I need to find the area of the region where x is less than y, divided by the total possible area of all outcomes for x and y.\n\nLet me visualize this. I can plot x and y on a coordinate plane, with x on the x-axis and y on the y-axis. The possible values of x range from 0 to 3, and y from 0 to 4. So, the total area of all possible (x, y) pairs is a rectangle with length 3 and height 4, so the area is 3 * 4 = 12.\n\nNow, I need to find the area where x < y. That is, the region where the x-coordinate is less than the y-coordinate.\n\nFirst, let's consider the line x = y. This line will divide the plane into two regions: one where x < y and one where x > y.\n\nIn our case, since x can be up to 3 and y up to 4, the line x = y will intersect the boundaries at (3,3). So, the region where x < y is below the line y = x, from x = 0 to x = 3, and y from y = x to y = 4.\n\nWait, actually, from x = 0 to x = 3, and for each x, y goes from y = x to y = 4, because x < y.\n\nSo, the region where x < y is bounded by:\n\n- x from 0 to 3,\n\n- y from x to 4.\n\nThis forms a trapezoid. To find its area, I can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid, which is (average of the two parallel sides) multiplied by the height.\n\nThe two parallel sides are the lengths at y = x and y = 4.\n\nAt x = 0, y goes from 0 to 4, but since x < y, even at x=0, y can be from 0 to 4, but x < y would include y=0 to y=4.\n\nWait, no. At x=0, y can be from 0 to 4, but x < y is always true for y > 0. But since x=0, x is always less than y as long as y > 0. So, the region starts at (0,0) and goes up to (3,4).\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Let's consider the line x = y from (0,0) to (3,3). The area where x < y is the area below this line within the rectangle [0,3] by [0,4].\n\nSo, the area where x < y is the area of the triangle from (0,0) to (3,3), plus the area of the rectangle from x=0 to x=3 and y=3 to y=4.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the area where x < y is the area below the line y = x from x=0 to x=3, up to y=4.\n\nLet me try to calculate the area where x < y.\n\nFirst, find the area of the region where x < y.\n\nThe region is bounded by:\n\n- x from 0 to 3,\n\n- y from x to 4.\n\nSo, it's a trapezoid with:\n\n- One base from x=0 to y=4 (height 4),\n\n- The other base from x=3 to y=4 (height 1, since at x=3, y can be from 3 to 4).\n\nWait, no. At x=0, y can be from 0 to 4, but x < y starts at y > 0. So, at x=0, y starts from 0, but x < y is true for y > 0. So, the area where x < y is from y=x to y=4, for x from 0 to 3.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the area of the rectangle minus the area where x >= y.\n\nBut that might be more complicated. Let's try to find the area of the trapezoid directly.\n\nThe trapezoid has:\n\n- At x=0, y from 0 to 4, but x < y is y from 0 to 4 (since x=0 < y for y > 0).\n\n- At x=3, y from 3 to 4.\n\nSo, the two parallel sides are y=4 (when x=0) and y=3 (when x=3).\n\nWait, no. At x=0, y can be from 0 to 4, but x < y means y > 0. So, at x=0, y from 0 to 4, but x < y is true for y > 0. So, the area starts at (0,0) and goes up to (3,4), with the boundary y = x.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should set up an integral to find the area where x < y.\n\nThe total area is 12, as calculated earlier.\n\nNow, to find the area where x < y, I can integrate over the region where x < y.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a simple geometric shape, maybe I can find the area without integration.\n\nLet me try to find the area of the region where x < y.\n\nThe boundary is y = x, from (0,0) to (3,3), and then vertical up to y=4 at x=3.\n\nSo, the area where x < y is the area below y = x from x=0 to x=3, and then from y=x to y=4.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to find the area where x >= y and subtract it from the total area.\n\nBut let's try to find the area where x < y directly.\n\nThe region where x < y is the area below the line y = x + c, but actually, it's y > x.\n\nWait, no. y > x is the same as x < y.\n\nSo, in the coordinate plane, y > x is the area above the line y = x.\n\nIn our case, since x can be up to 3 and y up to 4, the area where y > x is from x=0 to x=3, and y from x to 4.\n\nThis forms a trapezoid with:\n\n- One side from (0,0) to (3,3),\n\n- Another side from (3,3) to (3,4).\n\nSo, the area of this trapezoid can be calculated as the area of a trapezoid with parallel sides of lengths 3 (at x=3, y from 3 to 4) and 4 (at x=0, y from 0 to 4), and height 3 (from x=0 to x=3).\n\nThe formula for the area of a trapezoid is (a + b)/2 * h, where a and b are the lengths of the parallel sides, and h is the height.\n\nHere, a = 4 (at x=0), b = 1 (at x=3, since y from 3 to 4, which is a height of 1), and h = 3.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. At x=3, y from 3 to 4 is a height of 1.\n\nAt x=0, y from 0 to 4 is a height of 4.\n\nSo, the two parallel sides are 4 and 1, and the distance between them is 3 (from x=0 to x=3).\n\nSo, area = (1 + 4)/2 * 3 = (5/2) * 3 = 15/2 = 7.5.\n\nTherefore, the area where x < y is 7.5.\n\nThe total area is 12, so the probability is 7.5 / 12.\n\nSimplifying that, 7.5 divided by 12 is 7.5/12 = 15/24 = 5/8.\n\nSo, the probability is 5/8.\n\nLooking back at the options, 5/8 is one of them.\n\nAlternatively, to confirm, maybe I can set up a double integral.\n\nThe probability that x < y is the integral over the region where x < y of the joint probability density function of x and y.\n\nSince x and y are independent and uniformly distributed over [0,3] and [0,4], their joint density is (1/3)*(1/4) = 1/12.\n\nSo, P(x < y) = \u222b\u222b_{x < y} (1/12) dx dy.\n\nTo evaluate this, I can set up the integral limits.\n\nIntegrate with respect to x first, from x=0 to x=y, and then y from 0 to 4.\n\nWait, but x can be up to 3, and y up to 4.\n\nActually, better to set the limits considering the support of x and y.\n\nThe inner integral should be with respect to x, from x=0 to x=3, and y from x to 4.\n\nWait, no. Since x is from 0 to 3, and y is from 0 to 4, and we want x < y, the limits for y should be from x to 4, and x from 0 to 3.\n\nSo, P(x < y) = \u222b_{x=0}^{3} \u222b_{y=x}^{4} (1/12) dy dx.\n\nFirst, integrate with respect to y: \u222b_{y=x}^{4} (1/12) dy = [y/12] from x to 4 = (4/12) - (x/12) = (1/3) - (x/12).\n\nThen, integrate with respect to x: \u222b_{x=0}^{3} [(1/3) - (x/12)] dx = \u222b_{0}^{3} (1/3) dx - \u222b_{0}^{3} (x/12) dx = [(x/3)] from 0 to 3 - [(x^2)/24] from 0 to 3.\n\nCalculate each part:\n\nFirst part: (3/3) - (0/3) = 1.\n\nSecond part: (9/24) - (0/24) = 9/24 = 3/8.\n\nSo, P(x < y) = 1 - 3/8 = 5/8.\n\nThis matches the earlier result of 5/8.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 5/8.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1/2\n\nB. 7/12\n\nC. 5/8\n\nD. 2/3\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 5/8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{8}} \\]"
