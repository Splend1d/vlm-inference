                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: I hid my toddler's birthday presents in my teenager's closet. So, someone hid a toddler's birthday presents in their teenager's closet. Hmm, that seems a bit odd. But is it morally wrong? Well, hiding presents might be seen as a prank or maybe a way to prevent the toddler from finding them early, but it's probably not intended to harm anyone. The teenager might be inconvenienced if they need to access their closet, but it doesn't seem like a malicious act. Maybe it's just a harmless family joke or something. I don't think this is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: I poured sand on the campfire before leaving. Okay, so someone poured sand on a campfire before leaving, presumably to extinguish it. Now, I remember that when you're camping, it's important to make sure the fire is completely out to prevent forest fires. Using sand to put out a fire is a common practice, I think. It smothers the fire and helps cool it down. So, if someone is properly using sand to extinguish the fire, that seems responsible, not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe pouring sand on a campfire could be considered disrespectful to other campers if it leaves a mess, or perhaps there are specific rules about how to handle campfires in certain areas. But generally, putting out a fire with sand is accepted as a way to manage fire safety.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, the first one seems like a family matter that might not have serious moral implications, while the second is about safety and environmental responsibility.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, neither scenario seems clearly morally wrong. Both actions could be seen as neutral or even positive in certain contexts.\n\nBut let me double-check. In the first scenario, hiding presents might be seen as playful or protective, not harmful. In the second, pouring sand on a campfire is a standard way to ensure the fire is out, which is actually responsible behavior.\n\nTherefore, I would say that both scenarios are \"not wrong\" from a moral standpoint.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
