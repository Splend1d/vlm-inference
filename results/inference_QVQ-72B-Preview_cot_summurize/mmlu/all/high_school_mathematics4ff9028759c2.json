                    "text": "So I have this question: \"How many positive and negative integers is 12 a multiple of?\" And the options are A. 3, B. 12, C. 4, D. 6. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what it means for 12 to be a multiple of some integer. If 12 is a multiple of an integer, say n, that means that 12 can be expressed as n multiplied by some other integer. So, 12 = n * k, where k is also an integer.\n\nNow, the question is asking for both positive and negative integers that satisfy this condition. Since we're dealing with integers, I should consider both positive and negative numbers, as well as zero, but wait, zero multiplied by any non-zero integer won't give 12, so zero is probably not part of the solution.\n\nLet me think about the positive divisors of 12 first. The positive integers that divide 12 without leaving a remainder are:\n\n1, because 1 * 12 = 12\n\n2, because 2 * 6 = 12\n\n3, because 3 * 4 = 12\n\n4, because 4 * 3 = 12\n\n6, because 6 * 2 = 12\n\n12, because 12 * 1 = 12\n\nSo, there are 6 positive integers that 12 is a multiple of.\n\nNow, for the negative integers, I can have -1, -2, -3, -4, -6, and -12, because:\n\n12 = (-1) * (-12)\n\n12 = (-2) * (-6)\n\n12 = (-3) * (-4)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, for each positive divisor, there's a corresponding negative divisor that also satisfies the equation.\n\nTherefore, the total number of positive and negative integers that 12 is a multiple of should be the number of positive divisors plus the number of negative divisors.\n\nSince there are 6 positive divisors, there should be 6 negative divisors, making a total of 12 divisors.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's a better way to think about this.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that 12 is a multiple of any integer n if and only if n divides 12, which is the same as saying that 12/n is an integer.\n\nSo, I need to find all integers n such that 12/n is also an integer.\n\nThis includes both positive and negative integers.\n\nAs I listed earlier, the positive divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n\nThe negative counterparts are -1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -12.\n\nSo, total number is 12.\n\nBut let's see the options again:\n\nA. 3\n\nB. 12\n\nC. 4\n\nD. 6\n\nSo, according to my reasoning, the answer should be B. 12.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a trick here.\n\nIs zero considered? Well, 12 divided by zero is undefined, so zero shouldn't be included.\n\nAlso, fractions aren't integers, so only these 12 integers satisfy the condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently, but based on standard interpretation, 12 should have 12 divisors, including both positive and negative.\n\nWait, but in some contexts, people might only consider positive divisors, but the question explicitly says \"positive and negative integers,\" so I think 12 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider only positive divisors, it would be 6, which is option D, but since the question includes negative integers, it should be 12.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I think about the prime factorization of 12.\n\n12 = 2^2 * 3^1.\n\nThe number of positive divisors is (2+1)*(1+1) = 6, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nThen, including negatives, it doubles to 12.\n\nSo, yes, the total number is 12.\n\nI think I'm confident with that answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the question was interpreted differently, but based on standard mathematical definitions, 12 should have 12 divisors when considering both positive and negative integers.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
