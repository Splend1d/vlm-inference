                    "text": "So I have this question about how bacteria and yeast cells maintain the fluidity of their plasma membranes in environments where the temperature changes. The options are:\n\nA. Increase the concentration of solutes in the cytosol.\n\nB. Change the ratio of phospholipids with double covalent bonds in their tails to those without double covalent bonds in their tails.\n\nC. Replace phospholipids with glucose molecules.\n\nD. Exchange phospholipids from one side of the plasma membrane to the other.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what membrane fluidity is and how it's affected by temperature. Membrane fluidity refers to how easily the phospholipids and proteins in the membrane can move around. This fluidity is crucial for many cellular processes, like transporting molecules across the membrane and receiving signals from the environment.\n\nTemperature affects membrane fluidity because heat influences the movement of the phospholipid tails. At higher temperatures, the tails move more freely, making the membrane more fluid. At lower temperatures, the tails move less, making the membrane less fluid and potentially more rigid.\n\nTo maintain homeostasis, cells need to regulate their membrane fluidity despite changes in temperature. Let's evaluate each option to see which one is a viable strategy for bacteria and yeast cells.\n\nOption A: Increase the concentration of solutes in the cytosol.\n\nThis seems related to osmoregulation, which is about maintaining the balance of water and solutes inside the cell. While changing solute concentrations can affect the cell's internal environment, I don't think it directly influences membrane fluidity in response to temperature changes. So, probably not the right answer.\n\nOption B: Change the ratio of phospholipids with double covalent bonds in their tails to those without double covalent bonds in their tails.\n\nThis sounds promising. Phospholipids with double bonds in their tails are unsaturated and tend to make the membrane more fluid because the double bonds create kinks in the tails, preventing them from packing tightly together. Phospholipids without double bonds are saturated and allow the tails to pack more tightly, making the membrane less fluid.\n\nSo, if a cell increases the proportion of unsaturated phospholipids (those with double bonds), the membrane should remain more fluid at lower temperatures. Conversely, increasing saturated phospholipids would make the membrane less fluid, which might be necessary in higher temperatures to prevent the membrane from becoming too fluid and losing its integrity.\n\nBoth bacteria and yeast are known to adjust the saturation levels of their membrane lipids in response to temperature changes. This is a common adaptation mechanism called homeoviscous adaptation.\n\nOption C: Replace phospholipids with glucose molecules.\n\nGlucose is a simple sugar and is not a component of cell membranes. Membranes are made up of phospholipids and proteins, not sugars like glucose. While glucose can be found in the cell wall of some bacteria and yeast, it doesn't form part of the plasma membrane. Therefore, this option doesn't make sense in the context of maintaining membrane fluidity.\n\nOption D: Exchange phospholipids from one side of the plasma membrane to the other.\n\nIn eukaryotic cells like yeast, the plasma membrane has an asymmetrical distribution of phospholipids between the inner and outer leaflets. For example, in animal cells, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol are mostly found on the inner leaflet, while phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin are more common on the outer leaflet.\n\nHowever, in prokaryotes like bacteria, the membrane is generally symmetrical, with similar types of phospholipids distributed on both sides.\n\nBut regardless of the distribution, exchanging phospholipids from one side to the other wouldn't directly affect the overall fluidity of the membrane in response to temperature changes. It might affect other properties like permeability or recognition markers, but not fluidity per se.\n\nTherefore, this option seems less likely to be the primary mechanism for maintaining membrane fluidity in response to temperature changes.\n\nAfter considering all the options, Option B seems to be the most viable strategy for both bacteria and yeast cells to maintain homeostasis of their plasma membranes in a temperature-varying environment. By adjusting the ratio of unsaturated to saturated phospholipids, they can regulate the fluidity of their membranes to remain functional under different temperatures.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
