                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about sampling employees from five assembly plants. There are 1000 employees in total, evenly distributed across five plants, so each plant has 200 employees. The company wants to select a sample of 30 employees using a specific method: each manager puts their 200 employees' time cards in a bag, shakes them up, and draws six names at random. Then, they combine these six from each plant to make a total sample of 30.\n\nThe question is whether this method will result in a simple random sample of the 1000 employees. The options are:\n\nA. Yes, because every employee has the same chance of being selected.\n\nB. Yes, because every plant is equally represented.\n\nC. Yes, because this is an example of stratified sampling, which is a special case of simple random sampling.\n\nD. No, because not every group of 30 employees has the same chance of being selected.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to recall what a simple random sample (SRS) is. In an SRS, every possible sample of a given size has an equal chance of being selected. This means that each individual in the population has an equal chance of being included in the sample, and every combination of individuals has the same probability.\n\nNow, in this scenario, there are 1000 employees, and they're evenly distributed across five plants, each with 200 employees. The sampling method involves selecting six employees randomly from each plant and combining them to make a sample of 30.\n\nLet me consider if this meets the definition of an SRS.\n\nFirst, does every employee have an equal chance of being selected? Well, since each plant has 200 employees and six are selected randomly, each employee in a plant has a 6 out of 200 chance of being selected, which simplifies to 3 out of 100. Since this is true for every plant and every employee within a plant, it seems like each employee has the same chance of being selected.\n\nBut wait, is this sufficient for an SRS? Not necessarily. In an SRS, not only should each individual have an equal chance of being selected, but every possible combination of 30 employees should have an equal chance of being in the sample.\n\nLet's think about that. Suppose we have five plants, each contributing exactly six employees to the sample. Is it possible for some combinations of 30 employees to have a higher probability of being selected than others due to this stratified selection?\n\nActually, this sounds like stratified sampling, where the population is divided into strata (in this case, plants), and then samples are taken from each stratum. Stratified sampling is different from simple random sampling. In SRS, every subset of size 30 has the same probability, whereas in stratified sampling, the selection probabilities might be different for different combinations, depending on how the strata are defined.\n\nIn this setup, since each plant must contribute exactly six employees, some combinations of 30 employees are possible, while others are not. For example, a combination where one plant contributes seven employees and another contributes five would be impossible under this sampling method. Therefore, not all possible combinations of 30 employees have the same chance of being selected.\n\nSo, even though each employee has an equal chance of being selected, the method doesn't allow for all possible combinations of 30 employees to be equally likely, which is a requirement for a simple random sample.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. No, because not every group of 30 employees has the same chance of being selected.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A says yes, because every employee has the same chance of being selected. While this is true, it's not sufficient to conclude that it's an SRS, as explained earlier.\n\nOption B says yes, because every plant is equally represented. This is true in the sense that each plant contributes the same number of employees to the sample, but again, this doesn't make it an SRS; it makes it a stratified sample.\n\nOption C says yes, because this is an example of stratified sampling, which is a special case of simple random sampling. Wait, that's not correct. Stratified sampling is a different type of sampling from SRS. In stratified sampling, the population is divided into strata, and then samples are drawn from each stratum. This is indeed what's happening here, but stratified sampling is not a special case of SRS; it's an alternative to SRS.\n\nTherefore, the only correct answer is D. No, because not every group of 30 employees has the same chance of being selected.\n\nI think that's the right conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
