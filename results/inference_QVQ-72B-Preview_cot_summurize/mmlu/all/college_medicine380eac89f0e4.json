Ability to tolerate heavy training without getting sick or injured.\n\nB. Tactics.\n\nC. The diet.\n\nD. Ingesting carnitine during exercise.\n\nAlright, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, success in sport is usually influenced by a bunch of things, right? There's talent, practice, nutrition, strategy, and a whole lot more. So, the question is asking which of these options doesn't affect that success.\n\nLet's consider each one:\n\nA. Ability to tolerate heavy training without succumbing to illness or injury.\n\nWell, being able to handle tough training sessions without getting sick or hurt seems pretty important. If you can train hard without breaking down, you're likely to improve more over time. So, this probably does influence success. Maybe not directly, but it seems relevant.\n\nB. Tactics.\n\nTactics are like the plans or strategies you use during a game or competition. In most sports, having a good tactic can make a big difference. For example, in football, knowing when to pass or when to shoot is crucial. So, this seems like it would definitely influence how well you perform.\n\nC. The diet.\n\nNutrition is a huge part of athletic performance. What you eat affects your energy levels, recovery time, and overall health. A poor diet can lead to decreased performance and increased risk of injuries or illnesses. So, diet is definitely an influential factor in sports success.\n\nD. Ingestion of carnitine during exercise.\n\nNow, this one is a bit more specific. Carnitine is a substance that's sometimes used as a supplement, especially in endurance sports. It's thought to help with fat metabolism and might reduce fatigue.\n\nBut, does ingesting carnitine during exercise directly influence sports success?\n\nLet me think about this. Supplements like carnitine can be helpful for some athletes, but they're not a guarantee of success. Success in sports is about a combination of factors, including skill, fitness, strategy, and mental toughness.\n\nIngesting carnitine might give you a marginal benefit in terms of performance, but it's not a primary determinant of success. It's more of an additional consideration, rather than a key factor.\n\nComparing it to the other options:\n\n- Tolerating heavy training is fundamental for improvement.\n\n- Tactics are essential for performing well in competition.\n\n- Diet is a\u57fa\u7840 for optimal physical condition.\n\n- Ingesting carnitine is an optional supplement that might offer some benefits but isn't essential for success.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, D. Ingestion of carnitine during exercise seems like the factor that doesn't directly influence success in sport.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check. Is there any evidence that carnitine ingestion directly leads to success in sport?\n\nWell, research on carnitine supplements suggests that they might help with endurance and recovery, but these effects are generally mild and vary between individuals. Moreover, many successful athletes don't use supplements at all, relying instead on a balanced diet.\n\nTherefore, while carnitine might provide some athletes with a small advantage, it's not a deciding factor in sports success. It's more of an adjunct to a comprehensive training and nutrition plan.\n\nSo, my final answer would be D. Ingestion of carnitine during exercise does not directly influence success in sport.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
