[13,17,21]. Hmm, I remember that slicing in Python involves specifying start, stop, and step indices. The syntax is [start:stop:step]. In this case, since only the step is provided as 2, and the start and stop are both omitted, I think it means to start from the beginning of the list and step every 2 elements until the end.\n\nLet me see: b[::2] should start from the first element (index 0) and take every second element. So, starting at index 0 (11), then index 2 (15), and index 4 (19). That would give me [11,15,19], which is option C. But let me double-check.\n\nOption A is [19,21], which would be the last two elements, but that's b[4:6], not b[::2]. Option B is [11,15], which seems close to what I think is correct, but it's missing 19. Option D is [13,17,21], which would be every second element starting from index 1, but in this case, we're starting from index 0.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the step more carefully. If step is 2, it should select elements at indices 0,2,4,... and so on. So, indices 0 (11), 2 (15), and 4 (19). Yes, that matches option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options. Option A, [19,21], that would be elements at indices 4 and 5. If I slice from index 4 to the end with step 1, that would be b[4:], which is [19,21]. But in this case, the step is 2, so it should be every second element, not all elements from index 4 onwards.\n\nOption B, [11,15], that's indices 0 and 2. That's two elements, but actually, index 4 (19) should also be included if we're taking every second element. So, this seems incomplete.\n\nOption D, [13,17,21], which corresponds to indices 1,3,5. That would be every second element starting from index 1, which is b[1::2]. But our slice is b[::2], which starts from index 0.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems to be the correct one. Let me confirm by printing it in Python.\n\nIn Python 3, if I have b = [11,13,15,17,19,21], then b[::2] should be [11,15,19]. Let me try typing it:\n\nb = [11,13,15,17,19,21]\n\nprint(b[::2])\n\nYes, it outputs [11,15,19]. So, option C is correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let's see what happens if I change the step. For example, b[1::2] should be [13,17,21], which is option D. And b[2::2] would be [15,19], skipping every second element starting from index 2.\n\nSo, in conclusion, b[::2] outputs [11,15,19], which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
