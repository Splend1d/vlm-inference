                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Which 18th century writer produced a famous book called 'The Wealth of Nations'?\" And the options are A. Frederick Taylor, B. Henry Mintzberg, C. Adam Smith, D. Dr Samuel Johnson.\n\nAlright, let's see. I need to recall who wrote \"The Wealth of Nations.\" I think it's Adam Smith. But just to be sure, I should go through each option.\n\nFirst, Frederick Taylor. I remember he was involved in scientific management and efficiency in the workplace, but that was more in the late 19th and early 20th century. \"The Wealth of Nations\" was in the 18th century, so that doesn't seem right.\n\nNext, Henry Mintzberg. I think he's a management theorist, maybe from the 20th century as well. He might be known for his work on organizational structure and decision-making, but not sure about \"The Wealth of Nations.\"\n\nThen there's Adam Smith. I have a vague recollection that he was an economist who wrote about free markets and capitalism. \"The Wealth of Nations\" sounds like it's about economics and how countries accumulate wealth, which would fit with Adam Smith's areas of expertise.\n\nLastly, Dr. Samuel Johnson. I know he was a writer and lexicographer, famous for compiling a dictionary of the English language. While he was also an 18th-century figure, I don't recall him writing about economics.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like Adam Smith is the most likely author of \"The Wealth of Nations.\" But to make sure I'm not mixing things up, maybe I should think about the publication date of the book.\n\n\"The Wealth of Nations\" was published in 1776, which is definitely in the 18th century. Adam Smith was Scottish and lived from 1723 to 1790, so he was active during that time.\n\nFrederick Taylor was American and lived from 1856 to 1915, which is much later. Henry Mintzberg is still alive, born in 1939, and Dr. Samuel Johnson lived from 1709 to 1784, but again, I don't think he wrote \"The Wealth of Nations.\"\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I should consider if there's any possibility that one of the other writers collaborated on or wrote a later edition of the book. But no, \"The Wealth of Nations\" is firmly attributed to Adam Smith.\n\nAnother way to confirm is to think about the content of the book. It's about economics, specifically about how nations grow wealthy through trade and production. Adam Smith was an economist and philosopher, known for his ideas on free markets and laissez-faire capitalism.\n\nFrederick Taylor was known for scientific management, which is more about improving work efficiency and methods in factories. Henry Mintzberg is known for his studies on management roles and organizational theory. Dr. Samuel Johnson was a man of letters, a critic, and a lexicographer, not an economist.\n\nSo, all signs point to Adam Smith being the correct answer. I think I can confidently say that Adam Smith is the 18th-century writer who produced \"The Wealth of Nations.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Adam Smith}} \\]"
