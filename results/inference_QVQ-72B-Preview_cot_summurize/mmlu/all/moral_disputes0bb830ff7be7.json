Seriously presumptively wrong.\n\nC. Generally permissible.\n\nD. Always permissible.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what Marquis has said about abortion. I remember that Marquis argues that abortion is morally wrong because it deprives the fetus of its future life. He thinks that the moral status of the fetus is similar to that of a person, and therefore, killing it is akin to murder.\n\nSo, based on that, option A seems plausible: absolutely wrong. But let's consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B is \"seriously presumptively wrong.\" That sounds similar to A, but maybe not as absolute. \"Presumptively wrong\" suggests that there might be some exceptions or circumstances where it could be permissible, but generally, it's wrong. \"Seriously\" adds weight to that presumption.\n\nOption C is \"generally permissible.\" This would imply that, in most cases, abortion is acceptable, but there might be some exceptions where it's not.\n\nOption D is \"always permissible.\" This means that no matter the circumstances, abortion is morally acceptable.\n\nGiven Marquis's argument, which emphasizes the moral status of the fetus and compares abortion to murder, I don't think he would agree with C or D. He seems to be leaning towards the view that abortion is wrong, not permissible.\n\nBetween A and B, \"absolutely wrong\" seems stronger. \"Seriously presumptively wrong\" might allow for some exceptions, whereas \"absolutely wrong\" suggests no exceptions.\n\nBut I need to double-check. Maybe Marquis does allow for some exceptions, like in cases of severe fetal abnormalities or risk to the mother's life.\n\nLet me think about his actual position. I recall that in his famous article \"Why Abortion is Wrong,\" Marquis argues that abortion is morally equivalent to murder because it deprives the fetus of its future life. He compares it to killing a person who is in a coma or otherwise unconscious.\n\nGiven that comparison, he seems to be making a strong case that abortion is always wrong, without exceptions. So, option A, \"absolutely wrong,\" aligns with that.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether Marquis might have nuanced his position elsewhere. Maybe in other writings, he allows for some exceptions.\n\nBut based on what I remember from his main argument, he holds that abortion is always morally impermissible because it ends a potential life with future experiences and projects.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A: absolutely wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
