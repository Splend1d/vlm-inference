So, the correct answer should be C. Both of these.\n\nLet me think about this more deeply. The Doppler effect is a change in frequency and wavelength of a wave for an observer moving relative to the source of the wave. In the case of sound waves, if a source is moving towards an observer, the sound waves get compressed, leading to a higher frequency and shorter wavelength. Conversely, if the source is moving away from the observer, the sound waves get stretched out, resulting in a lower frequency and longer wavelength.\n\nSo, whether the source is moving towards or away from the observer, the Doppler effect is observed as a change in frequency. Therefore, the answer should include both options A and B.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"when a source of sound moves\". It doesn't specify relative to what. To be precise, the Doppler effect occurs when there is relative motion between the source and the observer. So, if both source and observer are moving together at the same velocity, there would be no Doppler effect.\n\nBut in the given options, it's asking whether the source moves toward you (observer), away from you, or both, or none.\n\nGiven that, both moving towards and away from the observer can cause the Doppler effect, so the answer should be C. Both of these.\n\nI think that's the correct understanding.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
