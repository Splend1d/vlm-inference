                    "text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a group of friends going out to lunch. It says that d people buy salad and p people buy soup. Each salad costs $3.99 and each soup costs $2.99. I need to write an expression for the total cost of the soups and salads.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. First, I need to find out how much is spent on salads and how much is spent on soups, and then add those two amounts together to get the total cost.\n\nSo, for the salads: there are d people buying salad, and each salad costs $3.99. To find the total cost for salads, I should multiply the number of salads by the cost per salad. That makes sense. So, total salad cost is 3.99 times d, which is 3.99d.\n\nNext, for the soups: there are p people buying soup, and each soup costs $2.99. So, the total cost for soups should be the number of soups times the cost per soup, which is 2.99 times p, or 2.99p.\n\nNow, to find the total cost of both, I need to add the total salad cost and the total soup cost together. So, that would be 3.99d plus 2.99p.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 3.99p + 2.99d\n\nB. 2.99p + 3.99d\n\nC. (2.99 + 3.99)(p + d)\n\nD. (3.99p + 2.99)d\n\nHmm, my expression is 2.99p + 3.99d, which matches option B.\n\nWait a minute, option A is 3.99p + 2.99d, which seems similar but not quite right because it seems like the costs are being multiplied by the wrong variables. Option C is (2.99 + 3.99)(p + d), which looks like it's using the distributive property, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Option D is (3.99p + 2.99)d, which seems like it's multiplying the total costs by d, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nLet me double-check my reasoning. The cost for salads is 3.99 times d, and the cost for soups is 2.99 times p. Adding them together gives 3.99d + 2.99p, which is option B.\n\nWait, but option A is 3.99p + 2.99d. That seems like it might be a mistake, perhaps mixing up the variables. But in my calculation, it's clear that the salad cost is 3.99 times d, and soup is 2.99 times p.\n\nOption C is (2.99 + 3.99)(p + d). Let's see, 2.99 + 3.99 is 6.98, and p + d is the total number of people. But in this problem, not everyone buys both salad and soup; rather, some buy salad and some buy soup. So, I don't think it's correct to add p and d and then multiply by the sum of the costs. That seems more applicable if everyone was buying both salad and soup, which isn't the case here.\n\nOption D is (3.99p + 2.99)d, which would be the total cost of soups and salads multiplied by d, which doesn't align with the problem's description.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression should be 2.99p + 3.99d, which is option B.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider an example with specific numbers. Suppose d = 2 and p = 3.\n\nThen, the total cost for salads would be 2 * 3.99 = $7.98.\n\nThe total cost for soups would be 3 * 2.99 = $8.97.\n\nSo, the total cost would be $7.98 + $8.97 = $16.95.\n\nNow, let's plug d = 2 and p = 3 into the expressions to see which one gives $16.95.\n\nOption A: 3.99*3 + 2.99*2 = 11.97 + 5.98 = $17.95, which is not $16.95.\n\nOption B: 2.99*3 + 3.99*2 = 8.97 + 7.98 = $16.95, which matches our total.\n\nOption C: (2.99 + 3.99)*(3 + 2) = 6.98 * 5 = $34.90, which is way off.\n\nOption D: (3.99*3 + 2.99)*2 = (11.97 + 2.99)*2 = 14.96 * 2 = $29.92, which is also incorrect.\n\nThis example confirms that option B is the correct expression for the total cost of soups and salads.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the costs per person, it might also help to understand the expression. But in this case, since each person buys either salad or soup, not both, the per-person cost approach might complicate things unnecessarily.\n\nIn conclusion, based on both logical reasoning and a numerical example, the correct expression for the total cost is 2.99p + 3.99d, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
