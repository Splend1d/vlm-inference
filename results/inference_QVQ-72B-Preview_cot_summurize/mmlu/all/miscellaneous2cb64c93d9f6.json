Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that nuclear-powered submarines are powered by nuclear reactors, which provide a lot of energy in a compact space. This makes submarines stay underwater for a long time without needing to surface for fuel. Pretty cool, right?\n\nNow, I think I recall that the first nuclear-powered submarine was the USS Nautilus. I remember learning about it in history class. Let me see if that rings a bell. The USS Nautilus was commissioned in 1954, I think, and it was built by the United States Navy. It was a big deal back then because it could travel faster and farther underwater than any submarine before it.\n\nLet me consider the other options to make sure. Neptune sounds like it could be related to the sea, but I don't remember any specific submarine by that name. Maybe it's a distractor.\n\nNordenfelt III\u2014that sounds like it might be an older submarine. I think Nordenfelt was a Swedish inventor who made early submarines in the late 19th century. So, that was way before nuclear power was a thing. So, probably not the first nuclear-powered submarine.\n\nNicholas\u2014well, that could be any number of things. There have been many submarines named after saints or important figures, but I don't recall any Nicholas being a nuclear-powered one.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about the Soviet Union. They also had nuclear submarines around the same time as the US, but I think their first one was commissioned later. So, maybe Nicholas refers to a Soviet submarine, but I'm not sure.\n\nNo, I think the first nuclear-powered submarine was definitely the USS Nautilus from the United States. Let me try to confirm that.\n\nI recall that the USS Nautilus was launched in 1954 and was the first submarine to complete a submerged transit of the Arctic Ocean, going under the North Pole in 1958. That was a historic achievement.\n\nSo, based on that, I'm pretty confident that Nautilus is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll double-check about the other options.\n\nNeptune: As I thought, it's probably a distractor, though there might be submarines named Neptune in various navies, but none that I know of were the first nuclear-powered.\n\nNordenfelt III: Definitely an early submarine, not nuclear-powered.\n\nNicholas: I can't recall any submarine by this name being nuclear-powered.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Nautilus.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Nautilus}} \\]"
