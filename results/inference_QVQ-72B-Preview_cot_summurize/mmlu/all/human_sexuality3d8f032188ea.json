                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"After releasing an egg, the follicle, under stimulation of luteinizing hormone, turns into a glandular mass of cells called the __________\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. corpus cavernosum\n\nB. corpus luteum\n\nC. corpus callosum\n\nD. corpus glandula\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to recall what happens to the follicle after it releases an egg. I remember that in the ovarian cycle, after ovulation, the follicle doesn't just disappear; it transforms into something else.\n\nLet me think about the ovarian cycle. The follicular phase leads up to ovulation, where a mature egg is released from the follicle. After that, in the luteal phase, the follicle changes form and becomes another structure.\n\nOption B is corpus luteum. I think I've heard of that before. Corpus luteum means \"yellow body\" in Latin, and I recall that it's involved in producing hormones after ovulation.\n\nOption A is corpus cavernosum. I believe that's related to another part of the body, maybe the penis or something, but not the ovary.\n\nOption C is corpus callosum. That sounds familiar, but I think that's part of the brain, connecting the two hemispheres. So that can't be it.\n\nOption D is corpus glandula. That seems like a general term for a glandular body, but I don't think it's specifically what forms from the follicle after ovulation.\n\nSo, between the options, B. corpus luteum seems the most plausible. But just to be sure, let me try to recall the process step-by-step.\n\nAfter ovulation, the remaining follicle is stimulated by luteinizing hormone (LH) to transform into the corpus luteum. This structure produces progesterone, which is essential for preparing the uterus for potential pregnancy.\n\nIf pregnancy occurs, the corpus luteum continues to produce progesterone to maintain the pregnancy. If not, it degenerates, and menstruation begins.\n\nSo, based on this, it makes sense that the follicle turns into the corpus luteum after releasing the egg.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the other options again:\n\nA. Corpus cavernosum: This is indeed part of the male reproductive system, involved in erections. Not relevant here.\n\nC. Corpus callosum: This is a bundle of neural fibers in the brain that connects the left and right cerebral hemispheres. Definitely not part of the ovary.\n\nD. Corpus glandula: This seems like a generic term and isn't specifically associated with the ovarian cycle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. corpus luteum.\n\nTo double-check, I can recall that the corpus luteum is a temporary endocrine structure in the ovary that develops from the graafian follicle after ovulation. It's responsible for producing progesterone and estrogen, which are crucial for the uterine lining's development.\n\nIn summary, after an egg is released from a follicle, under the influence of luteinizing hormone, the follicle transforms into the corpus luteum.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. corpus luteum}} \\]"
