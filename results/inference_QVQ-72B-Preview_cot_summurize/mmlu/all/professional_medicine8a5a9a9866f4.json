                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 47-year-old man who came to the doctor 12 hours after having a really bad headache that started suddenly in the back of his head, and now his neck is stiff too. He says this is the worst headache he's ever had, and it came on really fast. He doesn't have any other symptoms like fever or anything else. He has high blood pressure and acid reflux, and he takes hydrochlorothiazide for his blood pressure and ranitidine for his reflux.\n\nLet me think about this. He has a severe occipital headache, which is at the back of the head, and neck stiffness. These symptoms started suddenly, and it's been 12 hours since it began. He has no history of severe headaches before, which makes me think this might not be a typical migraine or something he usually experiences.\n\nHis vital signs show a temperature of 36.7\u00b0C, which is actually a bit low, but maybe it's just his normal temperature. His pulse is 100 beats per minute, which is a bit fast, and his blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg, which is high, but he has hypertension, so that might be his baseline.\n\nOn examination, his neck movement is limited because of pain, and there are no focal neurologic deficits, which means that there doesn't seem to be any specific area of the brain that's not working properly. That's important because it might rule out things like a stroke.\n\nNow, the options given are:\n\nA. Cluster headache\n\nB. Meningitis\n\nC. Migraine\n\nD. Subarachnoid hemorrhage\n\nI need to consider each one.\n\nStarting with cluster headaches. I know that cluster headaches are very severe, localized headaches that typically occur in cycles or clusters over weeks or months, with remission periods in between. They usually affect one side of the head, often around the eye, and can be accompanied by nasal congestion, tearing, and restlessness. The pain is excruciating but generally lasts from 15 minutes to 3 hours. In this case, the headache is occipital, which is at the back of the head, and it's been ongoing for 12 hours, which is longer than typical for a cluster headache. Also, neck stiffness isn't a common symptom of cluster headaches. So, maybe this isn't the best fit.\n\nNext, meningitis. Meningitis is an infection of the meninges, which are the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. The classic symptoms are fever, headache, and neck stiffness. Sometimes, there can be confusion or altered mental status. In this patient, the temperature is 36.7\u00b0C, which is subnormal, and he's oriented to person, place, and time, meaning his mental status seems clear. So, lacking fever and any mental status changes, meningitis seems less likely. But I should consider aseptic meningitis or other types that might not present with fever, but it's still not the best fit here.\n\nThen, migraine. Migraines can present with various symptoms, but typically, they have a throbbing quality, are unilateral (on one side), and can be accompanied by sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, and sometimes visual auras. This patient's headache is occipital, which is at the back, and it's severe and sudden in onset. He doesn't have any other typical migraine symptoms mentioned, and it's been ongoing for 12 hours without letting up. Migraines can last for days, but the sudden onset seems a bit atypical for migraine. Maybe it could be a migraine variant, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nFinally, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This is when there's bleeding into the space surrounding the brain, causing blood to collect in the subarachnoid space. The classic presentation is a sudden, severe headache, often described as \"the worst headache of my life,\" which peaks in intensity within minutes. Neck stiffness is common due to irritation of the meninges by the blood. Other symptoms can include vomiting, photophobia (sensitivity to light), and altered consciousness, but not always. In this patient, he has the sudden onset of a severe occipital headache, neck stiffness, and no other symptoms like fever or confusion. His vital signs are stable, and he's oriented.\n\nGiven the history and examination, subarachnoid hemorrhage seems like the most likely diagnosis. The sudden onset, the severity of the headache, the neck stiffness, and the absence of other symptoms align well with SAH. It's crucial to consider this diagnosis because SAH is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention to prevent further bleeding or complications.\n\nI should also consider his risk factors. He has hypertension, which is a known risk factor for SAH, especially if there's underlying vascular weakness or aneurysms. High blood pressure can cause weakening of the blood vessel walls, leading to potential rupture and bleeding.\n\nGiven this information, I think the best answer is D. Subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\nJust to make sure, let's quickly consider some other possibilities. Could this be a cerebral hemorrhage or intracerebral hemorrhage? That's different from subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage is bleeding within the brain tissue itself, often caused by hypertension, and can present with headache and neurological deficits. However, in this case, the patient doesn't have focal neurologic findings, which might suggest that the bleeding is not within the brain but rather in the subarachnoid space, supporting the diagnosis of SAH.\n\nAnother consideration could be spinal headache, also known as post-lumbar puncture headache, but the patient hasn't had any recent spinal procedures or injections that I'm aware of, so that's unlikely.\n\nPerhaps a thunderclap headache? Thunderclap headaches are characterized by a sudden, severe headache that reaches maximum intensity within minutes, and they can be a symptom of subarachnoid hemorrhage or other serious conditions. So, again, this points towards SAH.\n\nIn summary, based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and the physical examination, subarachnoid hemorrhage is the most likely diagnosis. It's essential to act quickly to confirm this diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment to prevent further complications.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
