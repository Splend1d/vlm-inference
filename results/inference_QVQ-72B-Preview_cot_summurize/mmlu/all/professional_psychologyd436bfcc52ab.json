                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand the Hersey and Blanchard's Situational Leadership Model. It talks about different leadership styles based on two dimensions: task orientation and relationship orientation. And the optimal style depends on the maturity level of the subordinates. There are four styles: Telling, Selling, Participating, and Delegating. I need to figure out what the delegating style is in terms of task and relationship orientation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each dimension means. Task orientation is about directing subordinates and focusing on getting the job done. Relationship orientation is about supporting and involving subordinates in decision-making. So, high task orientation means the leader is more focused on tasks and giving directions, while low task orientation means they're more hands-off in that area. Similarly, high relationship orientation means the leader is more supportive and involved in building relationships, and low means less involvement in relationships.\n\nNow, the delegating style is one where the leader gives subordinates the responsibility to make decisions and complete tasks with minimal supervision. So, in this style, the leader is not heavily involved in directing the tasks or making decisions for the subordinates. That suggests a low task orientation because the leader is not providing detailed directions or closely supervising the task execution.\n\nAs for the relationship orientation, in delegating, the leader still provides support and is available if needed, but doesn't actively intervene unless necessary. So, it's not highly relationship-oriented in the sense of being very involved or participative in decision-making. Instead, it's more about trusting the subordinates to handle things on their own.\n\nSo, based on this, delegating should be low in both task orientation and relationship orientation. That would make it option D: low task orientation and low relationship orientation.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe there's a different perspective. Let me think about it differently.\n\nIn the situational leadership model, the four styles are:\n\n1. Telling (high task, low relationship)\n\n2. Selling (high task, high relationship)\n\n3. Participating (low task, high relationship)\n\n4. Delegating (low task, low relationship)\n\nSo, according to this, delegating is indeed low in both task and relationship orientation. But I want to make sure I understand why it's low in relationship orientation.\n\nSome people might think that since the leader is delegating and showing trust, it's actually more relationship-oriented. However, in this model, relationship orientation refers to the leader's behavior in supporting and involving subordinates in decision-making. In delegating, the leader is giving authority and responsibility but isn't actively involved in the decision-making process or providing support unless asked for. Therefore, it's considered low in relationship orientation.\n\nSo, the answer should be D: low task orientation and low relationship orientation.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider the maturity level of subordinates. Hersey and Blanchard suggest that as subordinates become more mature (capable and confident), the leader can move from a telling style to selling, participating, and finally delegating. So, for highly mature subordinates, delegating is appropriate because they can handle the responsibility without much direction or support.\n\nTherefore, in this context, delegating is indeed characterized by low task orientation and low relationship orientation. So, the correct choice is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
