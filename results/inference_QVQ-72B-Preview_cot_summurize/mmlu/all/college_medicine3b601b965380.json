                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about self-efficacy. Karen is in therapy to build her self-esteem and self-efficacy, and after three months, she's already seeing improvements. The question is asking which strategy her therapist would NOT ask her to use for raising her sense of self-efficacy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what self-efficacy is. From what I recall, self-efficacy is about believing in your ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish a task. It's different from self-esteem, which is more about overall self-worth. So, building self-efficacy is about enhancing confidence in specific areas.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Seek positive feedback from friends.\n\nThis seems like a good strategy. Positive feedback can reinforce that you're doing well and can help boost confidence. If friends praise her for something, it might make her feel better about her abilities. So, I think this is a strategy therapists often recommend.\n\nOption B: Put in daily practice on the tasks she wishes to improve on.\n\nThis also sounds helpful. Practice makes perfect, right? If she practices something regularly, she's likely to get better at it, which should increase her confidence in her ability to do it. So, this seems like a good strategy too.\n\nOption C: Find others her age and ability who excel at tasks she is interested in.\n\nThis might be a bit tricky. On one hand, seeing others who are similar to her excelling could be inspiring and motivate her to improve. On the other hand, it might also lead to comparison, which can sometimes be demotivating if she feels she's not as good. However, generally, finding role models or mentors who are slightly ahead of her could be beneficial. So, I think this is mostly a positive strategy.\n\nOption D: Avoid potential pitfalls by withholding from tasks she is not proficient in.\n\nHmm, this one seems a bit off to me. Avoiding tasks she's not proficient in might prevent her from failing, but it also prevents her from learning and growing. If she never tries things she's not good at, how will she ever improve or develop new skills? This seems counterintuitive to building self-efficacy.\n\nIn fact, I think facing challenges and learning from failures is an important part of building self-efficacy. It's through overcoming obstacles that we build confidence in our abilities. So, avoiding tasks she's not proficient in would likely hinder her progress rather than help it.\n\nLet me double-check this. There's a concept in psychology called \"mastery experiences,\" which are seen as the most powerful way to build self-efficacy. Mastery experiences involve successfully completing a task, even if it's challenging. So, by tackling tasks she's not proficient in, she might initially fail, but if she persists and eventually succeeds, her self-efficacy should increase.\n\nAdditionally, avoiding challenging tasks could reinforce her belief that she can't do them, which would lower her self-efficacy further. So, yes, I think option D is not a strategy a therapist would recommend for building self-efficacy.\n\nTo sum it up:\n\n- Option A: Positive feedback can boost confidence.\n\n- Option B: Practice leads to improvement and increased confidence.\n\n- Option C: Finding role models can be inspiring and motivating.\n\n- Option D: Avoiding challenging tasks prevents learning and mastery experiences, which are crucial for building self-efficacy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option D: Avoid potential pitfalls by withholding from tasks she is not proficient in.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
