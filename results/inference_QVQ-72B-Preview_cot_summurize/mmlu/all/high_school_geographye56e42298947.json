                    "text": "Let's see what this question is about. It's about zero population growth, right? So, zero population growth (ZPG) means that the population isn't growing or decreasing; it's staying the same. That makes sense. Now, I need to figure out which of these options correctly describes when ZPG is achieved.\n\nOption A says \"CBR \u2013 CDR = 2.\" Hmm, CBR is the crude birth rate, and CDR is the crude death rate. So, if CBR minus CDR equals zero, that would mean births equal deaths, which might suggest no natural growth. But the option says equal to negative two, which would mean births are less than deaths by two, so that would be a decrease in population, not zero growth. Maybe this option is about the formula for population growth, but it seems off.\n\nOption B says \"Births + immigration = deaths + emigration.\" Okay, so this is equating the ways people come into a population (births and immigration) with the ways people leave (deaths and emigration). If these are equal, then the population size shouldn't change, right? Because every person added is balanced by one leaving or dying. That sounds like it could lead to zero population growth.\n\nOption C says \"Total fertility = 3.\" Total fertility rate is the average number of children a woman has over her lifetime. If it's three, that means each woman has three children, on average. In many countries, the replacement fertility rate is around two children per woman, because one child replaces the mother and one replaces the father. So, if total fertility is three, that should lead to population growth, not zero growth. Unless there's something else at play here.\n\nOption D says \"Replacement fertility is achieved.\" Replacement fertility is typically around two children per woman, as I just thought about in option C. If replacement fertility is achieved, that should mean the population is replacing itself without growth, which sounds like zero population growth.\n\nAlright, so options B and D seem relevant. Let me think more carefully.\n\nOption B: Births + immigration = deaths + emigration. This is about the balance between people coming in and people going out or dying. If this equation holds, then the population isn't growing or shrinking, which aligns with ZPG.\n\nOption D: Replacement fertility is achieved. This is about the fertility rate being at the level where the population replaces itself, which also suggests no growth.\n\nBut wait, are these two options saying the same thing? Not really. Option B is about the balance of births, deaths, immigration, and emigration, while option D is specifically about fertility rates.\n\nMaybe I need to recall the formula for population growth. I think population growth rate is equal to (birth rate - death rate) + (immigration rate - emigration rate). So, if births minus deaths plus immigration minus emigration equals zero, then there's zero population growth.\n\nLooking back at option A, it seems like it's saying CBR - CDR = -2, which would actually indicate more deaths than births, leading to a decrease in population, not zero growth. So, option A is probably incorrect.\n\nOption B is expressing that births plus immigration equal deaths plus emigration. That does seem like it would lead to zero population growth because every person added through birth or immigration is offset by a person leaving through death or emigration.\n\nOption C says total fertility equals three. In demographics, the total fertility rate needed for replacement varies somewhat by country due to factors like mortality rates and migration, but generally, a fertility rate of two is considered the replacement level in developed countries. A fertility rate of three would likely lead to population growth unless balanced by other factors like high mortality or net out-migration.\n\nOption D states that replacement fertility is achieved. This directly suggests that the fertility rate is at the level needed to maintain the population without growth.\n\nGiven this, options B and D both suggest zero population growth, but from different perspectives. Option B looks at all components of population change, while option D focuses on fertility.\n\nPerhaps the question is testing whether students understand that ZPG can be achieved through balancing all population components or just through reaching replacement fertility.\n\nI need to think about whether achieving replacement fertility automatically leads to zero population growth, considering migration.\n\nActually, replacement fertility is about balancing births and deaths to maintain a stable population size, assuming no migration. However, if there's net migration (more immigrants than emigrants), even with replacement fertility, the population could still grow. Conversely, with net emigration, the population could decrease even with replacement fertility.\n\nTherefore, replacement fertility is a necessary but not sufficient condition for ZPG; migration also needs to be factored in.\n\nSo, option D by itself might not fully capture all the factors needed for ZPG, especially if there's net migration.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, accounts for both natural increase (births minus deaths) and net migration (immigration minus emigration), suggesting that if these balances out to zero, then the population isn't growing.\n\nWait a minute, maybe both option B and D are related, but option B is more comprehensive because it includes migration.\n\nBut the question asks for the single best answer. Maybe I need to prioritize the most direct way to achieve ZPG.\n\nLet me consider the definition again. Zero population growth occurs when a population's size remains stable over time, meaning that the number of births plus immigrants equals the number of deaths plus emigrants.\n\nOption B directly states this balance: births + immigration = deaths + emigration.\n\nOption D mentions replacement fertility, which is related to births replacing the current population, but doesn't account for migration.\n\nTherefore, option B is a more accurate and complete description of when ZPG is achieved.\n\nI think the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
