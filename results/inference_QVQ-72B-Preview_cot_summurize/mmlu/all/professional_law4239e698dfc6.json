                    "text": "So I've got this legal problem here involving two properties, Greenacre and Blackacre, and some conditions attached to their transfer by Sally Sobriety to Friend and Associate, with Betty Boozer being the contingent beneficiary under certain circumstances. The issue is about who gets which property given that both Friend and Associate consumed alcohol on their respective properties, which seems to trigger some conditions in the conveyances.\n\nFirst, let's break down the conveyances:\n\n1. Greenacre was conveyed to \"Friend and her heirs, but if liquor is ever consumed on the property, then to Betty.\"\n\n2. Blackacre was conveyed to \"Associate and her heirs, but if Associate ever consumes alcohol on the property, then to Betty.\"\n\nNow, it's important to understand the nature of these conveyances. They seem to be fee simple determinable estates, also known as fee tails, where the estate is granted on a condition, and if that condition occurs, the estate may revert to the grantor or pass to another party.\n\nIn the case of Greenacre:\n\n- The estate is granted to Friend and her heirs, but there's a condition that if liquor is ever consumed on the property, the estate passes to Betty.\n\n- This seems like a fee simple determinable, where the condition is the consumption of liquor on the property, and upon that happening, the estate terminates and passes to Betty.\n\nIn the case of Blackacre:\n\n- The estate is granted to Associate and her heirs, but if Associate ever consumes alcohol on the property, then the estate passes to Betty.\n\n- Similarly, this appears to be a fee simple determinable, where the condition is specifically Associate consuming alcohol on the property, and upon that happening, the estate terminates and passes to Betty.\n\nNow, the scenario is that both Friend and Associate hosted wine-tasting events on their properties and personally consumed substantial alcohol.\n\nGiven this, let's analyze each property separately.\n\n**Greenacre:**\n\n- Friend hosted a wine-tasting event and consumed alcohol on the property.\n\n- According to the conveyance, if liquor is ever consumed on the property, then the estate passes to Betty.\n\n- It doesn't specify who consumes it, just that liquor is consumed on the property.\n\n- Since Friend consumed alcohol on the property, the condition has been triggered.\n\n- Therefore, the estate should pass to Betty.\n\n**Blackacre:**\n\n- Associate hosted a wine-tasting event and consumed alcohol on the property.\n\n- According to the conveyance, if Associate ever consumes alcohol on the property, then the estate passes to Betty.\n\n- This condition has also been triggered because Associate consumed alcohol on the property.\n\n- Therefore, the estate should pass to Betty.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, both properties should pass to Betty Boozer.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. Betty // Betty\n\nB. Friend // Betty\n\nC. Betty // Associate\n\nD. Friend // Associate\n\nIt seems that option A suggests both properties go to Betty, which aligns with my conclusion.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure I'm not missing something here.\n\nLet me double-check the conveyances.\n\nFor Greenacre:\n\n- \"Friend and her heirs, but if liquor is ever consumed on the property, then to Betty.\"\n\n- This seems clear: any consumption of liquor on the property triggers the transfer to Betty.\n\nFor Blackacre:\n\n- \"Associate and her heirs, but if Associate ever consumes alcohol on the property, then to Betty.\"\n\n- This specifies that it's Associate consuming alcohol on the property that triggers the transfer to Betty.\n\nIn both cases, the conditions have been met, so both properties should pass to Betty.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Betty // Betty, meaning both Greenacre and Blackacre go to Betty.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any potential nuances or exceptions that might affect this conclusion.\n\n- Perhaps there's a difference between \"liquor\" and \"alcohol.\" However, in common usage, liquor is a type of alcoholic beverage, so consuming wine (which is alcoholic) would still be considered consuming liquor in this context.\n\n- Is there any distinction between different types of alcohol or different beverages? Probably not, as the conditions seem to cover any alcoholic consumption.\n\n- Are there any potential life estates or other interests that might affect the transfer? The problem states that Sally died, so her interest as the original grantor has likely terminated.\n\n- Is there any possibility of reversion to Sally's estate? Given that Sally has died, and Betty is the only heir mentioned, it's unlikely unless there are other provisions not mentioned here.\n\nGiven these considerations, I still believe that both properties should pass to Betty.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Betty // Betty.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
