The options are A. -328716, B. 1000, C. 1000000, D. 1000000000.\"\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what a hertz is. A hertz (Hz) is a unit of measurement used to describe frequency, and it means one cycle per second. So, if something is happening at a frequency of 1 Hz, it's occurring once every second.\n\nNow, the question is asking about megahertz. The prefix \"mega-\" in mathematics and units of measurement stands for a million. So, 1 megahertz (MHz) should be equal to one million hertz.\n\nSince 1 hertz is one cycle per second, then 1 megahertz would be one million cycles per second.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. -328716\n\nB. 1000\n\nC. 1000000\n\nD. 1000000000\n\nOption C is 1,000,000, which is one million.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it again.\n\nIf 1 Hz = 1 cycle per second,\n\nThen 1 MHz = 1,000,000 Hz.\n\nSo, 1 MHz = 1,000,000 cycles per second.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nWait a minute, why is there a negative number in option A? That doesn't make sense for a frequency measurement, because frequency can't be negative. It's probably just a distractor.\n\nOption B is 1000, which is a thousand. That's not right because mega- is a million, not a thousand.\n\nOption D is 1,000,000,000, which is a billion. That's also not correct for mega-, which is a million.\n\nSo, yeah, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I should consider the relationship between kilohertz and megahertz.\n\nI know that:\n\n1 kHz = 1,000 Hz\n\n1 MHz = 1,000 kHz = 1,000,000 Hz\n\nSo, yes, that confirms that 1 MHz is indeed 1,000,000 cycles per second.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 1,000,000.\n\nI think that's it. It was pretty straightforward once I broke it down like that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
