                    "text": "So I've got this question about the spine, and there are four statements here. I need to figure out which one is true. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst statement: \"Back pain is an uncommon complaint.\" Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Back pain is actually one of the most common complaints that people have, especially lower back pain. It affects a lot of people at some point in their lives. So, I think this statement is false.\n\nSecond statement: \"Schober's test is designed to quantify the flexion of the lumbar spine.\" Okay, I've heard of Schober's test before. It's a way to measure the flexibility of the lower back. I think it involves marking points on the lower back and measuring how much they move when you bend forward. So, yes, that sounds like it's quantifying the flexion of the lumbar spine. This seems true.\n\nThird statement: \"Ankylosing spondylitis is a cause of hypermobility of the spine.\" Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis that affects the spine. I recall that it causes inflammation where the spine bones connect, leading to stiffness and over time, it can fuse the spine together. So, wouldn't that lead to decreased mobility or stiffness rather than hypermobility? Yes, I think so. So, this statement is probably false.\n\nFourth statement: \"Pregnancy is a cause of loss of lordosis of the lumbar spine.\" Lordosis is the natural curve of the lower back, the inward curve. During pregnancy, I know that a woman's center of gravity shifts because of the growing baby, which can cause changes in posture. I think that pregnancy can actually increase the lordosis, not decrease it. So, this statement might be false.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- A: False, back pain is common.\n\n- B: True, Schober's test measures lumbar flexion.\n\n- C: False, ankylosing spondylitis causes stiffness, not hypermobility.\n\n- D: False, pregnancy increases lordosis.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. Schober's test is designed to quantify the flexion of the lumbar spine.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check each point.\n\nBack pain is indeed common, with many people experiencing it due to various factors like poor posture, muscle strain, or underlying conditions like herniated discs or arthritis.\n\nSchober's test is a straightforward way to assess lumbar spine flexibility. It involves marking points on the lower back and measuring the distance between them when the person bends forward. An increase in distance indicates flexion.\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints. It typically causes fusion of the spine, leading to reduced mobility and a stiff back, not hypermobility.\n\nDuring pregnancy, the increasing weight of the fetus can lead to an increase in lordosis as the back curves more to compensate for the forward shift in\u91cd\u5fc3. This can sometimes lead to back pain in pregnant women.\n\nTherefore, my initial assessment stands, and the correct statement is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
