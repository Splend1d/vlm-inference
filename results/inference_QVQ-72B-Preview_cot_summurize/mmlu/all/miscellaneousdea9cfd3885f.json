                    "text": "So I need to figure out which of these words means \"yes\" in French. The options are A. qui, B. oui, C. ja, and D. okey-dokey. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that French is a Romance language, and I've heard that \"oui\" is the word for \"yes\" in French. But just to be sure, I should check each option.\n\nOption A is \"qui.\" I think \"qui\" in French is actually used as a relative pronoun, similar to \"who\" or \"that\" in English. For example, \"The man who came was my friend\" would be something like \"L'homme qui est venu est mon ami\" in French. So, \"qui\" doesn't mean \"yes\"; it's more about connecting clauses.\n\nOption B is \"oui.\" This one rings a bell. I'm pretty sure \"oui\" is French for \"yes.\" Let me see if I can confirm this. I recall that in many European languages, the word for \"yes\" is often similar to \"ja\" or \"si,\" but French uses \"oui.\" Maybe I can think of a phrase where \"oui\" is used, like \"Oui, je parle fran\u00e7ais,\" which means \"Yes, I speak French.\" That seems right.\n\nOption C is \"ja.\" I know that \"ja\" is the word for \"yes\" in some other languages, like Danish and Norwegian, but not in French. In fact, in German, \"ja\" is \"yes,\" and in Dutch, it's \"ja\" as well. But since we're dealing with French, \"ja\" isn't the correct choice here.\n\nOption D is \"okey-dokey.\" This sounds more like slang English for \"okay.\" I don't recall it being used in French. It might be an informal way of saying \"alright\" or \"agreed,\" but it's not the standard French word for \"yes.\"\n\nSo, based on my knowledge, \"oui\" is the correct answer for \"yes\" in French. Let me just double-check if there's any other word that could possibly mean \"yes\" in French. I don't think so. \"Oui\" is the standard word for affirmative.\n\nWait a minute, is there any regional variation in French where another word might be used for \"yes\"? For example, in some dialects or in different French-speaking countries, might they use a different word? I'm not sure. I think \"oui\" is pretty universal in French-speaking regions, but perhaps there are some variations.\n\nAfter a quick search in my memory, I recall that in some parts of Canada, especially in Quebec, people might say \"ouais\" in informal settings, but that's more of a slang term and not the standard \"oui.\" However, the question is asking for the standard word, so \"oui\" is still the correct choice.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that \"oui\" can be shortened to \"ouais\" or \"yeah\" in informal speech, but again, the standard form is \"oui.\"\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the structure of French sentences involving \"yes.\" For example, if someone asks a question like \"Parles-tu anglais?\" (Do you speak English?), the response would be \"Oui, je parle anglais\" (Yes, I speak English). So, \"oui\" fits perfectly there.\n\nI don't think there's any confusion between \"oui\" and other words in French. It's a straightforward word for \"yes.\"\n\nIn summary, after considering each option and recalling standard French usage, I'm confident that \"oui\" is the correct answer for \"yes\" in French. So, the answer is B. oui.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ oui}} \\]"
