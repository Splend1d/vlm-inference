                    "text": "So I have this polynomial: x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 + 2x + 1, and I need to factor it into linear factors over Z_7[x]. That means I'm working in modular arithmetic with modulus 7, and I want to break this cubic polynomial down into factors of the form (x - a), where a is a root of the polynomial in Z_7.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Z_7[x] means. It's the ring of polynomials with coefficients in Z_7, which is the integers modulo 7. So, all calculations will be done modulo 7.\n\nSince it's a cubic polynomial, it should factor into three linear terms, possibly with repeated roots. The options provided are all products of three linear factors, so I can assume it factors into three distinct linear terms.\n\nMy goal is to find the roots of the polynomial in Z_7, and then write the polynomial as the product of (x - root1), (x - root2), and (x - root3).\n\nTo find the roots, I need to solve the equation:\n\nx\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 + 2x + 1 \u2261 0 mod 7\n\nSince we're working modulo 7, I can test all possible values of x in Z_7, which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\nLet's evaluate the polynomial at each of these values:\n\n1. For x = 0:\n\n0\u00b3 + 2*0\u00b2 + 2*0 + 1 = 1 \u2260 0 mod 7\n\nSo, x = 0 is not a root.\n\n2. For x = 1:\n\n1\u00b3 + 2*1\u00b2 + 2*1 + 1 = 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 \u2260 0 mod 7\n\nNot a root.\n\n3. For x = 2:\n\n2\u00b3 + 2*2\u00b2 + 2*2 + 1 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 21 \u2261 0 mod 7\n\nSo, x = 2 is a root. That means (x - 2) is a factor.\n\nNow, since x = 2 is a root, I can perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out (x - 2).\n\nLet's perform synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients of the polynomial are 1 (for x\u00b3), 2 (for x\u00b2), 2 (for x), and 1 (constant term).\n\nUsing synthetic division with root 2:\n\n2 | 1   2   2   1\n\n  |     2   8  20\n\n  |----------------\n\n    1   4   10  21\n\nWait, but we're working in Z_7, so I need to perform the calculations modulo 7.\n\nSo, 8 mod 7 is 1, 20 mod 7 is 6, and 21 mod 7 is 0.\n\nSo, corrected synthetic division:\n\n2 | 1   2   2   1\n\n  |     2   1   6\n\n  |----------------\n\n    1   0   3   0\n\nSo, the polynomial divides into (x - 2) and (x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 + 3x + 0), but wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nStarting with coefficients 1, 2, 2, 1.\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply by 2: 1*2 = 2.\n\nAdd to the next coefficient: 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nMultiply by 2: 4*2 = 1 (since 8 mod 7 is 1).\n\nAdd to the next coefficient: 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nMultiply by 2: 3*2 = 6.\n\nAdd to the last coefficient: 1 + 6 = 7 \u2261 0 mod 7.\n\nSo, the quotient is x\u00b2 + 4x + 3.\n\nSo, x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 + 2x + 1 = (x - 2)(x\u00b2 + 4x + 3)\n\nNow, I need to factor x\u00b2 + 4x + 3 over Z_7.\n\nTo factor x\u00b2 + 4x + 3, I need to find two numbers that multiply to 3 and add up to 4, all modulo 7.\n\nLet's list pairs of numbers that multiply to 3 in Z_7:\n\n1*3 = 3\n\n2*5 = 10 \u2261 3 mod 7\n\n3*1 = 3\n\n4*4 = 16 \u2261 2 mod 7\n\n5*2 = 10 \u2261 3 mod 7\n\n6*6 = 36 \u2261 1 mod 7\n\nSo, possible pairs are (1,3) and (2,5).\n\nNow, check which pair adds up to 4 mod 7.\n\n1 + 3 = 4 mod 7\n\n2 + 5 = 0 mod 7\n\nSo, the pair is 1 and 3.\n\nTherefore, x\u00b2 + 4x + 3 = (x + 1)(x + 3)\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nx\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 + 2x + 1 = (x - 2)(x + 1)(x + 3)\n\nNow, let's check if this matches any of the given options.\n\nOption A: (x - 2)(x + 2)(x - 1)\n\nOption B: (x + 1)(x + 4)(x - 2)\n\nOption C: (x + 1)(x - 4)(x - 2)\n\nOption D: (x - 1)(x - 4)(x - 2)\n\nWait, my result is (x - 2)(x + 1)(x + 3). So, I need to see if (x + 3) is equivalent to any of the factors in the options.\n\nLet's see:\n\n(x + 3) in Z_7 is the same as (x - 4), because 3 \u2261 -4 mod 7.\n\nSo, (x + 3) = x - 4 + 7 = x - 4 mod 7.\n\nTherefore, (x - 2)(x + 1)(x + 3) = (x - 2)(x + 1)(x - 4)\n\nLooking at option C: (x + 1)(x - 4)(x - 2)\n\nThis is the same as my factorization, just with a different order.\n\nTherefore, the correct factorization is option C: (x + 1)(x - 4)(x - 2)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
