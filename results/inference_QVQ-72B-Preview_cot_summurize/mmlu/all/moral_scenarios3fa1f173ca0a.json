                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two separate situations presented, and I have to evaluate each one independently based on moral standards in the US around 2020. Then, I have to choose which combination of \"wrong\" or \"not wrong\" applies to each scenario.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"As I packed to leave the hotel, my suitcase was overflowing with souvenirs.\" So, someone is packing their suitcase full of souvenirs to leave a hotel. Souvenirs are usually items you collect or buy while traveling to remember your trip. Having a suitcase overflowing with them suggests that the person bought or collected a lot of things. But is this morally wrong?\n\nWell, collecting souvenirs is generally not considered morally wrong. It's a common practice among travelers. However, there might be some considerations here. For instance, if the person is taking more than their fair share of hotel amenities like shampoo or soap, that could be seen as greedy or even borderline theft. But the scenario mentions souvenirs, which are typically things you purchase or find, not necessarily amenities provided by the hotel.\n\nAlso, if the souvenirs were obtained illegally or unethically, that could be a moral issue. But assuming that the souvenirs were purchased legitimately or collected ethically, there doesn't seem to be anything inherently wrong with having a suitcase full of them.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I cut and divvied up the baby.\" This one sounds a lot more serious and potentially problematic. Cutting and dividing up a baby would be a horrific act, involving harm to an innocent life. Infanticide is illegal and morally reprehensible in all societies, including the US. It's a clear violation of moral and legal standards.\n\nHowever, before jumping to conclusions, I should consider if there's any possible ambiguity in the wording. The phrase \"cut and divvied up the baby\" could, in extremely rare cases, be interpreted metaphorically. For example, perhaps in the context of dividing attention or resources allocated to a baby. But even then, using such language is highly inappropriate and could be considered wrong due to the insensitive nature of the statement.\n\nGiven that, it's safe to assume that the literal interpretation of cutting and dividing a baby is what's being referred to here, which is unequivocally morally wrong.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Packing a suitcase full of souvenirs \u2013 Generally not considered morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Cutting and divvying up a baby \u2013 Clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong\" for the two scenarios respectively.\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, option C seems to be the one that fits my analysis: Scenario 1 is \"not wrong,\" and Scenario 2 is \"wrong.\"\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's something I'm missing. Perhaps in Scenario 1, there could be moral implications if the souvenirs were stolen or if the person is hoarding items that could be better used by others. However, without additional context, it's reasonable to assume that the souvenirs were acquired legitimately.\n\nIn Scenario 2, even if there's a metaphorical meaning, the act of cutting and dividing a baby is so heinous that it's impossible to interpret it as not being morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option C, \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
