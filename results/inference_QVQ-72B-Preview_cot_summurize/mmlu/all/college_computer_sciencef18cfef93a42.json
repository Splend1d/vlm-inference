I know that a set of operators is complete if you can use them to represent any Boolean expression. Basically, you should be able to build any logical function using just the operators from the set.\n\nLet's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A is {AND, NOT}. I know that with AND and NOT, you can make any other Boolean functions. For example, you can make OR using De Morgan's laws. So, I think this set is complete.\n\nOption B is {NOT, OR}. Similarly, with NOT and OR, you can also make AND using De Morgan's laws. So, this should also be complete.\n\nOption C is {AND, OR}. Hmm, this is interesting. I know that with just AND and OR, you might not be able to make NOT, which is necessary for negation. Without negation, can you represent all possible Boolean functions? I'm a bit unsure here.\n\nOption D is {NAND}. I recall that NAND is functionally complete on its own. You can make NOT, AND, and OR using just NAND gates. So, this should definitely be complete.\n\nWait a minute, so all options except maybe C seem to be complete. But the question is asking which one is NOT complete. So, probably C is the answer. But I want to make sure.\n\nLet me think about C again: {AND, OR}. Can you make NOT using just AND and OR? No, you can't. AND and OR are both monotonic functions; they don't introduce negation. So, without NOT, you can't create expressions that require negation.\n\nFor example, consider the Boolean expression for XOR, which is (A AND NOT B) OR (NOT A AND B). Without NOT, you can't construct this directly using just AND and OR.\n\nSo, it seems like {AND, OR} isn't complete because you can't represent expressions that involve negation.\n\nLet me double-check with another example. Suppose I have a function F(A, B) = NOT (A OR B). With just AND and OR, I can't get NOT (A OR B) directly because I don't have a way to negate the result of A OR B.\n\nWait, but I know that in Boolean algebra, NOT (A OR B) is equivalent to NOT A AND NOT B, but again, that requires NOT, which isn't available in this set.\n\nSo, yeah, I think {AND, OR} is not a complete set of Boolean operators because you can't represent all possible Boolean functions without negation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's confirm the completeness of the other options:\n\nA. {AND, NOT}: Complete, as you can make OR using De Morgan's laws.\n\nB. {NOT, OR}: Complete, as you can make AND using De Morgan's laws.\n\nD. {NAND}: Complete, as NAND can be used to make NOT, AND, and OR.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. {AND, OR}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
