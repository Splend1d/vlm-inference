                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 22-year-old woman who's experiencing urticaria, which is basically hives. She's had a few episodes in the past week, and each one goes away on its own. The thing is, when the doctor checked her out, everything else seems fine\u2014no other problems found in the history or physical exam. Now, the question is asking what the best next step should be.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Determine the serum IgE concentration\n\nB. Determine the total eosinophil count\n\nC. Refer her to an allergist\n\nD. Treat the symptoms\n\nAlright, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, urticaria is a skin condition where you get itchy, red bumps that can appear and disappear suddenly. It can be acute or chronic, and in this case, it's been happening for a week, so it's likely acute urticaria.\n\nNow, the patient has had several episodes, but each resolves on its own, and there are no other abnormalities found in the history or physical examination. That suggests that this might be a straightforward case without any underlying serious conditions.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Determine the serum IgE concentration.\n\nIgE is an antibody that's often associated with allergic reactions. High levels of IgE can indicate an allergic condition. However, in urticaria, especially acute urticaria, the cause is often not allergic. In fact, many cases of acute urticaria are triggered by infections or other non-allergic factors. So, measuring IgE might not be the first step here, especially since there are no other signs of an allergic condition.\n\nOption B: Determine the total eosinophil count.\n\nEosinophils are white blood cells that are often elevated in allergic reactions and parasitic infections. Again, similar to IgE, while eosinophilia can be seen in some cases of urticaria, it's not a routine test for acute urticaria, especially when there are no other symptoms or abnormalities. It might be more relevant in chronic urticaria or when there's a suspicion of an underlying condition like asthma or a parasitic infection.\n\nOption C: Refer her to an allergist.\n\nAn allergist is a specialist who deals with allergies and immunological disorders. While it's always an option to refer to a specialist, especially if the condition is complex or doesn't respond to standard treatment, in this case, the urticaria is acute and self-resolving. It might be overkill to refer her to an allergist right away when simpler measures could suffice.\n\nOption D: Treat the symptoms.\n\nThis seems like a plausible approach. Acute urticaria often resolves on its own, especially within a week or so. Symptomatic treatment, such as antihistamines, can help relieve the itching and reduce the appearance of hives. Since the episodes are resolving spontaneously, and there are no other issues, managing the symptoms might be the most appropriate course of action.\n\nLet me think about any potential underlying causes. Acute urticaria can be caused by a variety of factors, including infections, medications, foods, or even physical triggers like pressure or cold. However, in many cases, especially when it's acute and self-limiting, the cause remains unknown.\n\nGiven that the patient has had multiple episodes but each resolves on its own, and there are no other symptoms or abnormalities, it's likely that this is a case of acute, self-limiting urticaria. In such cases, the typical approach is to treat the symptoms and observe for any recurrence or development of other symptoms that might indicate a need for further investigation.\n\nI should also consider whether there's any need for diagnostic testing. For example, if there were suspicions of an allergic trigger, perhaps checking for specific IgE antibodies to certain allergens could be considered. However, given that there are no other symptoms or history of allergies, and the urticaria is acute and resolving, such testing might not be necessary.\n\nSimilarly, checking for eosinophils might be relevant if there were signs of an allergic condition or a parasitic infection, but again, in the absence of such indications, it might not be the first step.\n\nReferring to an allergist could be considered if the urticaria doesn't respond to treatment, becomes chronic, or if there are concerns about underlying causes. But in this scenario, where the condition is acute and self-resolving, it seems premature to make a referral.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate course of action appears to be to treat the symptoms. This would involve prescribing an antihistamine, such as cetirizine or loratadine, which are effective in relieving the itching and reducing the hives. Additionally, advising the patient to avoid known triggers, if any are identified, and to keep the skin cool and moistened can also help.\n\nIt's also important to provide reassurance to the patient that acute urticaria often resolves on its own and that the symptoms can be managed effectively with medication.\n\nSo, based on the information provided and the options given, I would say that option D, treating the symptoms, is the most appropriate course of action at this time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
