                    "text": "So I have this problem here: it takes a machine 12 minutes to fill 200 bottles of soda. I need to find out how many minutes it will take the same machine to fill 500 bottles at the same rate. The options are 25 minutes, 28 minutes, 30 minutes, or 40 minutes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of bottles and the time it takes to fill them. Since the rate at which the machine fills the bottles is constant, I can set up a proportion to solve for the unknown time.\n\nI know that 200 bottles take 12 minutes. I need to find out how many minutes it takes to fill 500 bottles. Let\u2019s call the unknown time \u201cx\u201d minutes.\n\nSo, I can set up the proportion as:\n\n200 bottles / 12 minutes = 500 bottles / x minutes\n\nThis proportion says that the ratio of bottles to time is the same in both cases.\n\nTo solve for x, I can cross-multiply:\n\n200 * x = 500 * 12\n\n200x = 6000\n\nNow, divide both sides by 200 to solve for x:\n\nx = 6000 / 200\n\nx = 30 minutes\n\nSo, it will take the machine 30 minutes to fill 500 bottles of soda at the same rate.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there\u2019s another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the rate of the machine. If it fills 200 bottles in 12 minutes, then the rate is 200 bottles per 12 minutes.\n\nTo find the rate in bottles per minute, I can divide 200 by 12:\n\nRate = 200 bottles / 12 minutes \u2248 16.67 bottles per minute\n\nNow, to find out how long it takes to fill 500 bottles at this rate, I can divide the total number of bottles by the rate per minute:\n\nTime = 500 bottles / (16.67 bottles per minute) \u2248 30 minutes\n\nThis matches the previous result. So, again, it\u2019s 30 minutes.\n\nLet me see if there\u2019s another way to confirm this.\n\nAnother approach could be to find out how long it takes to fill one bottle and then multiply that by 500.\n\nIf 200 bottles take 12 minutes, then time per bottle is 12 minutes / 200 bottles = 0.06 minutes per bottle.\n\nFor 500 bottles, time would be 500 * 0.06 = 30 minutes.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I\u2019m confident with this. But just to be thorough, let me consider the units.\n\nIn the first method, I set up a proportion of bottles to time, which should be correct since the rate is constant.\n\nIn the second method, I calculated the rate and then used it to find the time for 500 bottles.\n\nIn the third method, I found the time per bottle and then scaled it up to 500 bottles.\n\nAll three methods give me the same answer, which is 30 minutes.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is 25 minutes, B is 28 minutes, C is 30 minutes, and D is 40 minutes. So, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think if there\u2019s any possible way the answer could be different. Maybe if the rate isn\u2019t constant, but the problem states that it\u2019s at the same rate, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the machine gets slower as it fills more bottles, but again, the problem says the rate is constant, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\u2019s a warm-up time or something, but again, the problem seems straightforward about the rate.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 30 minutes, option C.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let me plug in the numbers again.\n\nIf 200 bottles take 12 minutes, then to fill 500 bottles, which is 2.5 times more (because 500 \u00f7 200 = 2.5), the time should also be 2.5 times more.\n\nSo, 12 minutes \u00d7 2.5 = 30 minutes.\n\nThere we go, another way to look at it and it still comes out to 30 minutes.\n\nI think that\u2019s pretty much it. I can\u2019t see any reason why it wouldn\u2019t be 30 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
