                    "text": "So I've got this problem about taxi cabs and their annual mileage. It says that taxicabs in a metropolitan area are driven an average of 75,000 miles per year with a standard deviation of 12,000 miles. I need to find the probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles, given that it has been driven over 80,000 miles. And I'm supposed to assume a normal distribution for the miles driven per year among cabs.\n\nAlright, first things first. I know that the normal distribution is symmetric around the mean, and that the mean here is 75,000 miles with a standard deviation of 12,000 miles. So, the miles driven follow a normal distribution: \\(X \\sim N(75000, 12000)\\).\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles, given that it has been driven over 80,000 miles. In probability terms, that's \\(P(X < 100000 | X > 80000)\\).\n\nHmm, conditional probability. I remember that conditional probability is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\\]\n\nSo in this case, \\(A\\) is \\(X < 100000\\) and \\(B\\) is \\(X > 80000\\). Therefore,\n\n\\[P(X < 100000 | X > 80000) = \\frac{P(80000 < X < 100000)}{P(X > 80000)}\\]\n\nOkay, so I need to find the probability that \\(X\\) is between 80,000 and 100,000 miles, and divide that by the probability that \\(X\\) is greater than 80,000 miles.\n\nTo find these probabilities, I can standardize the values by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation to get z-scores.\n\nFirst, let's find the z-scores for 80,000 and 100,000 miles.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\n\\[z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\]\n\nSo for 80,000 miles:\n\n\\[z_{80k} = \\frac{80000 - 75000}{12000} = \\frac{5000}{12000} = \\frac{5}{12} \\approx 0.4167\\]\n\nAnd for 100,000 miles:\n\n\\[z_{100k} = \\frac{100000 - 75000}{12000} = \\frac{25000}{12000} \\approx 2.0833\\]\n\nNow, I need to find \\(P(80000 < X < 100000)\\), which is the same as \\(P(0.4167 < Z < 2.0833)\\), and \\(P(X > 80000)\\), which is \\(P(Z > 0.4167)\\).\n\nI can look up these probabilities in a standard normal distribution table.\n\nFirst, find \\(P(0.4167 < Z < 2.0833)\\). That's the area under the standard normal curve between z = 0.4167 and z = 2.0833.\n\nI know that \\(P(Z < 2.0833)\\) is the cumulative probability up to z = 2.0833, and \\(P(Z < 0.4167)\\) is the cumulative probability up to z = 0.4167.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[P(0.4167 < Z < 2.0833) = P(Z < 2.0833) - P(Z < 0.4167)\\]\n\nLooking up the z-scores in the standard normal table:\n\n- \\(P(Z < 2.08) \\approx 0.9812\\)\n\n- \\(P(Z < 0.42) \\approx 0.6628\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[P(0.4167 < Z < 2.0833) \\approx 0.9812 - 0.6628 = 0.3184\\]\n\nNext, find \\(P(Z > 0.4167)\\), which is:\n\n\\[P(Z > 0.4167) = 1 - P(Z < 0.4167) \\approx 1 - 0.6628 = 0.3372\\]\n\nNow, plug these into the conditional probability formula:\n\n\\[P(X < 100000 | X > 80000) = \\frac{0.3184}{0.3372} \\approx 0.944\\]\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 0.06\n\nB. 0.34\n\nC. 0.66\n\nD. 0.94\n\nSo, the closest answer is D. 0.94.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the z-scores:\n\n- \\(z_{80k} = \\frac{80000 - 75000}{12000} = \\frac{5000}{12000} = 0.4167\\)\n\n- \\(z_{100k} = \\frac{100000 - 75000}{12000} = \\frac{25000}{12000} \\approx 2.0833\\)\n\nLooking up the standard normal table values:\n\n- \\(P(Z < 2.08) \\approx 0.9812\\)\n\n- \\(P(Z < 0.42) \\approx 0.6628\\)\n\nCalculating \\(P(0.4167 < Z < 2.0833) = 0.9812 - 0.6628 = 0.3184\\)\n\nAnd \\(P(Z > 0.4167) = 1 - 0.6628 = 0.3372\\)\n\nThen, \\(P(X < 100000 | X > 80000) = \\frac{0.3184}{0.3372} \\approx 0.944\\)\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this conditional probability in terms of areas under the normal curve. The denominator is the area to the right of 80,000 miles, and the numerator is the area between 80,000 and 100,000 miles divided by the area to the right of 80,000 miles.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider that given \\(X > 80000\\), we're dealing with a truncated normal distribution. But I think the method I used is sufficient and straightforward.\n\nI don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is D. 0.94.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
