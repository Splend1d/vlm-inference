The right of parents or legal guardians of a child to inspect the child\u2019s school records.\n\nB. The right of patients to have access to their own hospital records.\n\nC. The requirement for employers to make reasonable modifications to tests for applicants with disabilities.\n\nD. The requirement for schools to provide a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d to students with disabilities.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Buckley Amendment is. I think it has something to do with student privacy in education records. Let me confirm that.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that the Buckley Amendment is actually the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which was originally passed in 1974. It's a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. So, it's related to student records, not hospital records or employment tests.\n\nOption A says it's about the right of parents or legal guardians to inspect their child's school records. That sounds like it could be part of FERPA because FERPA does grant parents certain rights regarding their children's education records.\n\nOption B mentions the right of patients to access their own hospital records. That seems more related to health privacy, which is covered by HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. So, that's probably not the Buckley Amendment.\n\nOption C talks about employers making reasonable modifications to tests for applicants with disabilities. That sounds like it's related to employment discrimination, which would be covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). So, again, not likely the Buckley Amendment.\n\nOption D mentions the requirement for schools to provide a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d to students with disabilities. That sounds like it's about special education services, which are provided under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like Option A is the correct answer because it aligns with FERPA's provisions on parental access to education records.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check.\n\nFERPA does indeed give parents the right to review their child's education records, with some exceptions for certain types of records like confidential letters and recommendations.\n\nOn the other hand, the right of patients to access their hospital records is covered by HIPAA, which is a different law altogether, enacted in 1996.\n\nThe requirement for employers to make reasonable accommodations for applicants with disabilities is part of the ADA, which was signed into law in 1990.\n\nAnd the provision for a free appropriate public education for students with disabilities is part of IDEA, which was first passed in 1975.\n\nSo, all things considered, the Buckley Amendment, which is FERPA, primarily deals with the privacy of education records and parental access to them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. the right of parents or legal guardians of a child to inspect the child\u2019s school records.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
