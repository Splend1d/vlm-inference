                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a ranch owned by a sister and a brother as joint tenants. That means they both own the property together, and there's this thing called \"right of survivorship,\" which I think means that if one dies, the other automatically gets their share. But that might not be directly relevant here.\n\nNow, the sister decides to transfer her interest in the ranch to her friend using a quitclaim deed, and she does this without the brother's knowledge. The question is, what interest does the friend have in the ranch after this transfer?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. No interest.\n\nB. An undivided one-half interest with right of survivorship.\n\nC. An undivided one-half interest without right of survivorship.\n\nD. A lien against the entire property.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, joint tenancy is a way of holding title to property where each owner has an equal interest, and there's a right of survivorship. So, if one joint tenant dies, their share passes to the surviving joint tenant(s) automatically, without going through probate.\n\nNow, the sister, being one of the joint tenants, wants to transfer her interest to her friend via a quitclaim deed. A quitclaim deed is a type of deed that transfers whatever interest the grantor has in the property, without any warranty or guarantee that the grantor actually owns the property or that there are no liens on it.\n\nBut here's the thing: in joint tenancy, each joint tenant can generally transfer their interest without the consent of the other joint tenants. However, when one joint tenant transfers their interest, the joint tenancy is broken, and the new owner holds the interest as a tenant in common with the remaining original joint tenant.\n\nSo, if the sister transfers her interest to her friend, the friend would hold an undivided one-half interest in the ranch, but as a tenant in common, not as a joint tenant. That means there's no right of survivorship between the friend and the brother.\n\nWait a minute, but the options mention \"undivided one-half interest\" with or without right of survivorship. So, option C seems to align with this scenario: an undivided one-half interest without right of survivorship.\n\nOption B suggests that the friend would have an undivided one-half interest with right of survivorship, which I think is incorrect because that would require the brother's consent or agreement to create a new joint tenancy with the friend.\n\nOption A says no interest, but that doesn't seem right because the sister is transferring her interest, and a quitclaim deed does transfer whatever interest she has.\n\nOption D mentions a lien against the entire property. A lien is a claim on property to secure a debt or obligation, and I don't think transferring an interest via a quitclaim deed creates a lien. It's more about transferring ownership interest, not creating a debt claim.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option C is the correct answer: an undivided one-half interest without right of survivorship.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn joint tenancy, when one joint tenant deeds their interest to another person, the result is that the new owner holds a tenant in common interest, not a joint tenancy interest, unless all parties agree to create a new joint tenancy.\n\nSo, in this case, since the brother wasn't involved in the transfer and didn't consent to it, the friend would hold a tenant in common interest with the brother.\n\nTherefore, the friend has an undivided one-half interest without right of survivorship.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
