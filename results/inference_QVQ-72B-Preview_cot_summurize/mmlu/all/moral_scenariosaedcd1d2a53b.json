The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: I added a red sock to my roommate's white laundry. Hmm, so adding a red sock to white laundry could potentially cause the white clothes to get discolored if the red sock bleeds color during the wash. That seems like it could be a problem, but is it morally wrong? Well, maybe it's careless or inconsiderate, but is it on the level of something that's clearly morally wrong? I'm not so sure. Maybe it's more of a mistake or an accident rather than something intentional that's morally reprehensible.\n\nSecond scenario: I asked the homeless shelter for food even though I make plenty of money. This one seems trickier. If someone is requesting food from a homeless shelter when they don't actually need it, that could be seen as taking advantage of resources meant for people who are truly in need. That feels like it could be morally wrong because it's depriving someone else who might need those resources more. It's kind of like misrepresenting oneself to get something that isn't intended for them.\n\nSo, comparing the two, the first scenario seems more like a mistake or carelessness, while the second seems like intentionally misrepresenting one's situation to access resources meant for others in need. According to ordinary moral standards in the US, taking advantage of charitable resources when not needed might be considered clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's more to it. In the first scenario, maybe adding the sock was accidental, and accidents happen. It's not like it's done with malicious intent. In the second scenario, intentionally seeking help when not needed seems deliberate and could harm others who do need assistance.\n\nYeah, I think my initial assessment is right. So, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
