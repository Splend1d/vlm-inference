                    "text": "So I've got this situation here where a buyer is suing a seller because the seller allegedly violated a non-compete agreement. The agreement was supposed to prevent the seller from opening another hot dog stand within two miles of the buyer's new stand for two years. But now, the seller has opened one half a mile away, which is a no-no according to the contract. The problem is, the original contract is lost, and the buyer has a duplicate carbon copy instead. The seller is objecting to the authenticity of the written contract, so the question is whether this duplicate copy can be admitted as evidence in court.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First off, I need to understand the rules of evidence here, particularly regarding original documents and duplicates. I recall there's something called the \"best evidence rule\" that generally requires the original document to be produced in court when its contents are in question. But what happens when the original is lost?\n\nOption A says the copy is inadmissible because the seller contests the authenticity of the written contract. Hmm, that seems relevant. If the authenticity is in dispute, maybe the court needs the original to verify it. But what if the original is not available?\n\nOption B claims it's inadmissible because the best evidence rule always requires the original contract. But wait, I think the best evidence rule isn't absolute. There are exceptions, like when the original is lost or destroyed without bad faith on the part of the proponent.\n\nOption C says it's admissible because the duplicate is a carbon copy. That might be a factor, but I don't think that's the only consideration.\n\nOption D states it's admissible because the original contract was lost. That sounds promising, but I need to make sure there aren't any other requirements or exceptions.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. The best evidence rule, under the Federal Rules of Evidence, generally requires the original writing to prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph. However, there are exceptions to this rule. One of them is when the original is lost or destroyed, and the proponent of the evidence was not the one who lost or destroyed it under circumstances implying bad faith.\n\nIn this case, the original contract is lost prior to trial. If the buyer can show that the loss was not due to any bad faith on their part, then a duplicate might be admissible.\n\nBut the seller is objecting on the grounds of authenticity. So, even if the duplicate is admissible under the best evidence rule, the authenticity is still in question.\n\nWait a minute, authenticity is a separate issue from the best evidence rule. The best evidence rule deals with the form of the evidence, i.e., whether a duplicate is acceptable when the original is not available. Authenticity, on the other hand, concerns whether the evidence is what it purports to be.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the best evidence rule might allow the duplicate to be admitted since the original is lost, provided there's no bad faith involved. Then, the authenticity of the duplicate would be a separate issue to be resolved.\n\nBut the question seems to suggest that the seller is objecting based on authenticity. So, perhaps both issues are at play here.\n\nLet me look up the Federal Rules of Evidence to get a clearer picture.\n\nUnder Rule 1003, \"A duplicate is admissible to the same extent as an original unless a genuine question is raised about the duplicate's authenticity or when, as provided by law or by agreement between the parties, the best evidence must be provided.\"\n\nSo, according to this rule, a duplicate is generally admissible to the same extent as the original, unless there's a question about its authenticity or some legal requirement or agreement stipulates that the best evidence must be provided.\n\nIn this case, the original is lost, so it can't be provided. Therefore, the duplicate should be admissible, subject to any questions about its authenticity.\n\nBut the seller is objecting on the grounds of authenticity. So, even if the duplicate is admissible under the best evidence rule, the authenticity is still in dispute.\n\nNow, under Rule 901, which deals with authenticating evidence, the proponent must offer evidence sufficient to support a finding that the evidence is what it is claimed to be.\n\nIn this situation, the buyer is trying to introduce a duplicate carbon copy of the contract. If the buyer can provide sufficient evidence to show that this duplicate is a true and accurate copy of the original contract, then it should be admissible.\n\nPossible ways to authenticate the duplicate could include testimony from someone who saw the original and can confirm that the duplicate matches it, or perhaps other documentary evidence that corroborates the terms of the contract.\n\nAdditionally, if the seller had a copy of the contract and it matches the buyer's duplicate, that could help establish authenticity.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, the seller is objecting to the authenticity of the written contract, so presumably, the seller doesn't have a copy or disputes the terms.\n\nSo, the buyer needs to find a way to authenticate the duplicate despite the seller's objection.\n\nSuppose the buyer can produce witnesses who were present when the contract was signed and can testify that the duplicate is an accurate copy. That might be sufficient to authenticate it.\n\nAlternatively, if there's other evidence that supports the terms of the contract, such as correspondence between the parties discussing the non-compete agreement, that could also help.\n\nBut let's get back to the multiple-choice options.\n\nOption A says the copy is inadmissible because the seller contests the authenticity of the written contract.\n\nOption B says it's inadmissible because the best evidence rule requires the original contract always be used as evidence.\n\nOption C says it's admissible because the duplicate is a carbon copy.\n\nOption D says it's admissible because the original contract was lost.\n\nBased on the rules I looked up, the best evidence rule allows duplicates when the original is lost, provided there's no bad faith involved and the duplicate can be authenticated.\n\nSo, Option B is incorrect because the best evidence rule doesn't always require the original; duplicates are acceptable under certain conditions.\n\nOption A suggests that contesting authenticity makes the duplicate inadmissible, but that's not necessarily true. The proponent can still attempt to authenticate the duplicate through other means.\n\nOption C mentions that it's admissible because it's a carbon copy. While being a carbon copy might imply it's an accurate replica of the original, authentication still requires some evidence to support that.\n\nOption D seems the most straightforward: the original was lost, so the duplicate is admissible under the exceptions to the best evidence rule.\n\nHowever, I need to consider whether the loss of the original was without bad faith on the part of the buyer. If the buyer lost the original through no fault of their own, then the duplicate should be admissible.\n\nAssuming that's the case, then Option D seems correct.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"the original contract was lost prior to trial.\" It doesn't specify whose fault it was, but perhaps it's implied that it was lost without bad faith by the buyer.\n\nGiven that, Option D seems like the correct answer: the duplicate is admissible because the original contract was lost.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIf the original was lost, and the buyer can show that it was lost without bad faith, then under the best evidence rule, a duplicate is admissible.\n\nThe authenticity is a separate issue, but the duplicate can still be admitted, and then the authenticity can be established through other evidence.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. admissible, because the original contract was lost.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
