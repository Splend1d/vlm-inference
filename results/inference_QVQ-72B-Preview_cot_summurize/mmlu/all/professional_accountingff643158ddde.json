                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about the statement of cash flows for Zokro, which is a nonprofit organization. They use the indirect method to prepare their statement of cash flows, and I need to understand how to determine the net cash provided or used by operating activities. Specifically, I need to know which of these options should be added back to the change in net assets: purchase of equipment, payment on long-term debt, depreciation, or decrease in accounts payable.\n\nFirst, I should recall what the indirect method entails. The indirect method starts with the net income or, in the case of nonprofits, the change in net assets, and adjusts it for non-cash items and changes in working capital to arrive at net cash from operating activities.\n\nSo, the basic formula is:\n\nNet cash from operating activities = Change in net assets + Adjustments for non-cash items + Changes in working capital\n\nNow, I need to look at each option and see which one should be added back to the change in net assets.\n\nOption A: Purchase of equipment.\n\nI know that purchasing equipment is typically an investing activity, not an operating activity. In the cash flow statement, the purchase of equipment would be shown in the investing section as a cash outflow. Using the indirect method for operating activities, we don't usually adjust for investing activities directly in the operating section. So, maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nOption B: Payment on long-term debt.\n\nPayments on long-term debt are considered financing activities. In the indirect method for operating activities, financing activities are generally shown separately and don't get added back to the change in net assets. So, similar to the purchase of equipment, this seems more related to financing rather than operating activities.\n\nOption C: Depreciation.\n\nDepreciation is a non-cash expense. In the income statement, depreciation reduces net income, but since it's not a cash outflow, we need to add it back when calculating cash from operations. In the context of a nonprofit, net income is replaced with change in net assets. So, depreciation, being a non-cash expense, should be added back to the change in net assets to arrive at the cash provided by operating activities.\n\nOption D: Decrease in accounts payable.\n\nAccounts payable are current liabilities. Changes in accounts payable affect operating cash flows. If accounts payable decrease, it means that the organization is paying more than it's accruing, which would use cash. Therefore, a decrease in accounts payable would be subtracted from the change in net assets to calculate operating cash flows.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, depreciation seems to be the correct answer because it's a non-cash expense that needs to be added back to the change in net assets to find the cash provided by operating activities.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In the indirect method, we start with net income or change in net assets and adjust for non-cash items and changes in working capital. Depreciation is indeed a non-cash item, so it should be added back. The purchase of equipment and payment on long-term debt are both cash outflows but relate to investing and financing activities, respectively, not operating activities. A decrease in accounts payable would typically be subtracted because it represents cash being paid out.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. Depreciation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
