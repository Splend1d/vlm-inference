They have a bet: the winner gets a free beer from the other two. In the second frame, the first friend gets a strike\u2014knocks down all 10 pins. But the second friend claims the first friend fouled because his foot went over the line. The first friend denies it and wants to mark it as a strike. The second friend disagrees and writes a zero on the scorecard. This really ticks off the first friend.\n\nNow, the second friend goes to bowl his frame. While his back is turned, the first friend approaches with a bowling ball in hand. He raises the ball, threatening to hit the second friend's head. The second friend doesn't see this coming. The third friend witnesses the whole thing but stays silent, doesn't warn the second friend.\n\nIn the end, the first friend hits the second friend on the head with the bowling ball, causing a serious scalp wound.\n\nThe question is: if the second friend sues the third friend, will he prevail?\n\nOptions are:\n\nA. Prevail, because the third friend was aware of the danger.\n\nB. Prevail, on account of the third friend's omission to act.\n\nC. Not prevail, because the first friend was responsible for his injury.\n\nD. Not prevail, because the third friend was under no duty to warn the second friend of the danger.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the legal concepts at play here. This seems to be a case involving tort law, specifically negligence or perhaps even intentional torts, depending on the circumstances.\n\nThe second friend is considering suing the third friend for not warning him about the first friend's actions. So, the third friend saw the first friend approaching with a bowling ball, intending to hit the second friend, but didn't warn the second friend.\n\nNow, for the second friend to prevail in a lawsuit against the third friend, there needs to be a legal duty on the third friend to act\u2014to warn the second friend, in this case.\n\nDuty is a big concept in negligence cases. Generally, people don't have a duty to act to prevent harm to others unless there's a special relationship or some other legal basis that imposes such a duty.\n\nLet's consider if there's a special relationship here. The three are friends, but is that enough to impose a duty to warn? Probably not. Friendship alone doesn't typically create a legal duty to act.\n\nWhat about the fact that they're in a public place, like a bowling alley? Does that change things?\n\nWell, in public places, people generally don't have a duty to act to prevent harm to others unless they're in some way responsible for the situation or have created the danger themselves.\n\nWait a minute, the third friend didn't create the danger; the first friend did. The third friend just witnessed it and didn't warn the second friend.\n\nSo, does the third friend have a duty to warn the second friend in this scenario?\n\nI think the answer is no. There's no general duty to act to prevent harm caused by third parties in most jurisdictions.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose the third friend had a reasonable opportunity to warn the second friend and could have easily done so without any risk to himself. Does that change anything?\n\nWell, yes, it does make it more compelling morally, but legally, it's still unclear.\n\nIn some legal systems, there might be a duty to act if you're in a position to prevent harm without any significant risk to yourself, but this is not\u666e\u904d in all jurisdictions.\n\nMoreover, in the context of tort law, the general rule is that there's no duty to rescue or to act to prevent harm to others unless there's a special relationship or some other legal basis.\n\nFor example, parents have a duty to care for their children, employers have a duty to protect employees, and innkeepers have a duty to protect guests. But among friends in a social setting, it's less likely that such a duty exists.\n\nAdditionally, in some cases, there might be a duty to act if you've created the peril or if you're in control of the situation that leads to the harm.\n\nIn this scenario, the third friend didn't create the peril\u2014the first friend did. The first friend was the one who was angry and approached with the bowling ball.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the third friend doesn't have a legal duty to warn the second friend, and thus, the second friend wouldn't prevail in a lawsuit against the third friend.\n\nBut let's consider another angle. Suppose the third friend had promised to watch out for the second friend or had some agreement to protect him. If that were the case, then there might be a duty to act.\n\nHowever, in the scenario provided, there's no mention of any such agreement or promise. They're just friends bowling together.\n\nTherefore, based on standard tort law principles, the second friend wouldn't prevail against the third friend.\n\nWait, but option A says \"prevail, because the third friend was aware of the danger.\"\n\nAwareness of danger isn't enough to impose a duty to act. Knowing that harm might occur doesn't create a legal obligation to prevent it, unless there's a special relationship or some other duty-imposing circumstance.\n\nOption B says \"prevail, on account of the third friend's omission to act.\"\n\nAgain, omission isn't actionable unless there's a duty to act, which, as discussed, seems lacking in this scenario.\n\nOption C says \"not prevail, because the first friend was responsible for his injury.\"\n\nThis seems plausible. The direct cause of the injury was the first friend's actions\u2014hitting the second friend with a bowling ball. The first friend would be the primary defendant in any negligence or assault claim.\n\nHowever, the question is about the third friend's liability for not warning the second friend.\n\nOption D says \"not prevail, because the third friend was under no duty to warn the second friend of the danger.\"\n\nThis aligns with what I've been thinking. Without a duty to act, the third friend isn't liable for failing to warn.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D. Not prevail, because the third friend was under no duty to warn the second friend of the danger.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of the second friend prevailing.\n\nPerhaps, in some jurisdictions, there's a common law duty to warn if you see someone about to be harmed and you can do so easily without risk to yourself.\n\nHowever, this isn't a universal principle, and even if it exists in some places, it's not something that's typically enforced in civil lawsuits.\n\nMoreover, in the context of friends in a social setting, it's hard to see how the third friend would have a legal duty to warn the second friend.\n\nAnother consideration: if the third friend had some reason to believe that the first friend was dangerous and didn't warn the second friend, could that be seen as negligence?\n\nPossibly, but again, without a pre-existing duty to act, it's unlikely to hold up in court.\n\nFurthermore, in tort law, there's the concept of foreseeability. Could the third friend have foreseen that the first friend would hit the second friend with a bowling ball?\n\nGiven the heated argument, perhaps yes, but again, foreseeability alone doesn't create a duty to act.\n\nTherefore, after considering all this, I believe the best answer is D. Not prevail, because the third friend was under no duty to warn the second friend of the danger.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
