                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about Malcolm X, the famous civil rights leader. The question is asking for his birth name, and the options are Michael Brown, Malcolm Little, Malcolm Lincoln, and Michael Lloyd. Hmm, I think I remember that Malcolm X was originally named Malcolm Little. Let me see if I can confirm that.\n\nFirst off, I know that Malcolm X was a prominent figure in the civil rights movement, especially known for his time with the Nation of Islam and his later conversion to Sunni Islam. He was a powerful speaker and advocated for the rights of African Americans in a time when racism was particularly entrenched in American society.\n\nNow, recalling his biography, I believe he was born Malcolm Little and that he later changed his name to Malcolm X when he joined the Nation of Islam. The \"X\" was meant to symbolize the unknown name of his African ancestors who were enslaved and had their names taken from them. Then, after leaving the Nation of Islam and becoming a Sunni Muslim, I think he changed his name again to El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. But that was after his pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nSo, based on that, his birth name should be Malcolm Little. Let me check if any of the other options could possibly be correct. Michael Brown sounds familiar, but I think that's another person altogether. There was a Michael Brown who was involved in a significant incident in Ferguson, Missouri, but that's a different context and time period. So, that probably isn't the right answer.\n\nMalcolm Lincoln\u2014wait, that sounds like a combination of Malcolm X and Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln was the president who issued the Emancipation Proclamation during the Civil War, which declared that all slaves in Confederate territory were free. So, that seems like a mix-up, not his actual birth name.\n\nThen there's Michael Lloyd. I don't recall any connection between Malcolm X and that name. It might be a distractor in this question.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possibility that Malcolm X had a different birth name that I'm not remembering. I know that he was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and that his father was an Baptist minister who was involved in the civil rights movement. His family faced persecution from white supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan, which might have influenced his early life and eventual activism.\n\nBut getting back to the question, I'm pretty confident that his birth name was Malcolm Little. Let me see if I can find any confirmation for this. I recall that when he joined the Nation of Islam, he dropped his surname \"Little\" and adopted the surname \"X\" to represent the unknown nature of his African heritage. Later, after his conversion to Sunni Islam and his hajj, he took the name El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, which reflects his new religious identity.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the correct answer is Malcolm Little. Just to be thorough, I'll double-check if there's any possibility that he was born with a different name or if there's any confusion with other civil rights activists.\n\nWait a minute, I remember that Martin Luther King Jr. was originally named Michael King Jr., but he was renamed to Martin Luther King Jr. in honor of the German theologian Martin Luther. But that's Martin Luther King Jr., not Malcolm X. So, that doesn't affect my conclusion here.\n\nAlso, I know that Malcolm X had several siblings and that his family moved around quite a bit during his childhood due to the threats they faced. But again, that doesn't impact his birth name.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The other options\u2014Michael Brown, Malcolm Lincoln, and Michael Lloyd\u2014don't seem to align with the known biography of Malcolm X. Therefore, the correct answer should be Malcolm Little.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. Malcolm Little}} \\]"
