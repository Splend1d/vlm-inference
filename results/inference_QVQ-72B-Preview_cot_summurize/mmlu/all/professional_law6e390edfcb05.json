                    "text": "So I've got this contract law problem here, and I need to figure out how much the brick mason is entitled to recover from the builder for breaching their contract. Let me try to understand the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a brick mason who was hired by a builder on a written one-year contract. The salary was $45,000, and the employment was supposed to start on March 1. But before the job even began, on February 15, the builder said they couldn't afford to employ the mason as a brick mason because they didn't have enough building contracts to keep all their employees busy.\n\nInstead of letting the mason go completely, the builder offered the mason a different job as a night guard for the same one-year period, but at a lower salary of $25,000. The mason declined this offer and stayed unemployed for the entire year. The problem also mentions that no brick mason jobs were available in the community during that year, but the mason could have found other work as a day laborer that would have paid up to $25,000 a year.\n\nNow, at the end of the year, the mason is suing the builder for breach of contract. I need to determine how much, if anything, the mason is entitled to recover.\n\nI remember that in contract law, when one party breaches a contract, the non-breaching party is entitled to damages that compensate them for the loss resulting from the breach. The goal is to put the non-breaching party in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed as agreed.\n\nSo, in this case, the builder breached the contract by not providing the job as a brick mason at the agreed salary of $45,000. Therefore, the mason would have earned $45,000 if the contract had been fulfilled.\n\nHowever, the law also requires that the non-breaching party mitigate their damages\u2014that is, they have to take reasonable steps to reduce the loss resulting from the breach. If they fail to do so, their damages can be reduced accordingly.\n\nIn this scenario, the mason declined the offer to work as a night guard at $25,000 and remained unemployed for the entire year. But the problem also says that no brick mason jobs were available in the community, and the mason could have obtained other employment as a day laborer that would have paid up to $25,000 a year.\n\nSo, the question is, did the mason mitigate their damages? They could have taken the night guard job or another day laborer job that would have paid $25,000, but they chose not to and stayed unemployed instead.\n\nI think the key here is whether the alternative jobs were comparable in nature and terms to the original contract. The original job was as a brick mason at $45,000, and the alternative offers were a night guard position at $25,000 or day laborer jobs at $25,000.\n\nFirst, let's consider the night guard position. It's a different type of job with a significantly lower salary. The mason might have had reasons for declining this offer, such as it not being in line with their skills or career goals. However, in terms of mitigation, the law generally expects the non-breaching party to accept reasonable alternative employment, even if it's not ideal.\n\nSimilarly, the day laborer jobs paying $25,000 were available, which is less than half of the original $45,000. Again, the mason might not have wanted to take a job that pays significantly less, but in terms of mitigation, they would be expected to take reasonable steps to minimize their losses.\n\nSo, if the mason could have earned $25,000 by taking one of these jobs but chose not to, their damages would be reduced by that amount. That is, they can't recover for losses they could have avoided by taking reasonable action.\n\nTherefore, the mason's damages would be the difference between the contract price ($45,000) and what they could have earned in mitigation ($25,000), which is $20,000.\n\nWait a minute, but option A says $20,000, which is the difference between $45,000 and $25,000. That seems to align with my calculation.\n\nOption B is $45,000, which would be the full contract price, but that doesn't account for the mason's obligation to mitigate damages.\n\nOption C says nothing, because the builder didn't act in bad faith when it discharged the mason. But I don't think bad faith is relevant here. Even if the builder had to terminate the contract due to economic reasons, if there was a contract in place, and it was breached, the mason is entitled to damages, regardless of the builder's intentions.\n\nOption D says nothing, because the mason did not mitigate his damages. But according to what I've thought so far, the mason could have mitigated his damages by taking the $25,000 job, so the damages would be reduced by that amount, not that the mason gets nothing.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option A seems correct: $20,000 (the $45,000 contract price less the $25,000 the mason could have earned in other employment).\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any chance that the mason might be entitled to more?\n\nWell, sometimes, if the alternative job is substantially different in nature or requires different skills, the mason might not be obligated to accept it. For example, if the night guard position required working nights, which might be inconvenient for the mason, or if it was outside their area of expertise.\n\nHowever, in this case, the problem states that no brick mason jobs were available, so the mason would have had to take a different type of job anyway. Therefore, the nature of the job might not be as relevant, as long as the job was comparable in terms of skill level and salary.\n\nWait, but the night guard job was offered by the builder at $25,000, which is significantly less than $45,000. So, even if the mason had accepted that job, they would still be suffering a loss of $20,000.\n\nBut the mason declined that offer and remained unemployed. So, in that case, the mason is not entitled to the full $45,000 because they could have mitigated their damages by accepting the $25,000 job.\n\nTherefore, the recoverable damages should be the difference between the contract price and the mitigation amount, which is $20,000.\n\nI think option A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
