                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Supreme Court decisions and their relation to segregation, particularly in the context of Martin Luther King Jr.'s efforts to end it. The options are Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857), Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas (1954), Worcester v. Georgia (1831), and Plessy v. Ferguson (1896). I need to figure out which one was the primary contributor to the system of segregation that Martin Luther King and others were fighting against.\n\nFirst off, I should probably recall what each of these cases was about and then see which one had the most significant impact on segregation.\n\nStarting with Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857), I remember that this case was about a slave named Dred Scott who had lived in free territories and was seeking his freedom. The Supreme Court ruled against him, stating that Black people, whether enslaved or free, were not considered American citizens and therefore could not sue in federal court. Also, the Court declared that Congress did not have the power to prohibit slavery in the territories. This decision was a huge blow to abolitionists and had significant implications for the expansion of slavery, but I'm not sure how directly it contributed to the system of segregation that Martin Luther King was fighting against. Segregation was more about the separation of races after slavery was abolished, whereas Dred Scott was about slavery itself and the status of Black people before the Civil War.\n\nNext, Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas (1954) rings a bell as a landmark case that helped end segregation in schools. The Supreme Court ruled that separate educational facilities for Black and White students were inherently unequal, thus overturning the \"separate but equal\" doctrine established in Plessy v. Ferguson. This decision was a major victory in the Civil Rights Movement and directly challenged segregation in public schools. But since it came in 1954, it was part of the effort to end segregation, not contribute to it. So, it doesn't seem like it was the primary contributor to the segregation system that Martin Luther King was trying to end.\n\nThen there's Worcester v. Georgia (1831). I have to think back on this one. I believe this case involved the rights of Native Americans and the sovereignty of Indian nations within Georgia. The Supreme Court ruled that Georgia could not impose regulations on the Cherokee Nation without consent, essentially upholding the tribal sovereignty of Native American tribes. However, President Andrew Jackson is famous for ignoring this decision and proceeding with the removal of Native Americans from their ancestral lands, leading to events like the Trail of Tears. But again, this case seems more related to Native American rights and less directly to the segregation of Black and White people that Martin Luther King was dealing with.\n\nLastly, there's Plessy v. Ferguson (1896). This one sounds familiar because it established the \"separate but equal\" doctrine, which allowed states to segregate public facilities as long as they provided equal amenities for both races. This decision effectively legalized segregation and was a cornerstone of the Jim Crow laws that enforced racial segregation in the Southern United States. It remained the law of the land until it was overturned by Brown v. Board of Education in 1954.\n\nGiven this background, it seems that Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) was the primary legal foundation for the system of segregation that Martin Luther King and other Civil Rights activists were trying to dismantle. The \"separate but equal\" principle justified segregation in public spaces, transportation, education, and other areas, which was exactly what the Civil Rights Movement was fighting against.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I think the correct answer is D. Plessy v. Ferguson (1896).\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check the other options quickly. Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857) was about slavery and the status of Black people before the Civil War, not directly about segregation after Reconstruction. Brown v. Board of Education (1954) was part of the effort to end segregation, not to establish it. And Worcester v. Georgia (1831) was about Native American rights and tribal sovereignty, which isn't directly related to the segregation of Black and White people.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D. Plessy v. Ferguson (1896).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
