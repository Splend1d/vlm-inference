                    "text": "Okay, so Shafi is making a point about boys doing better in math than girls based on some test scores. He mentions that Tony and David both got 100% on their math tests, which seems to support his idea that boys are better at math. But then it turns out that there are seven girls in the class who also got 100%, and only two boys did. So, Shafi is ignoring that more girls achieved the top score.\n\nNow, I need to figure out which of these psychological biases this exemplifies: hindsight bias, confirmation bias, functional fixedness, or proactive interference.\n\nLet's start by understanding each one:\n\n1. **Hindsight bias**: This is when, after an event has occurred, people believe they knew the outcome all along. It's like saying, \"I knew it was going to happen that way,\" even if they didn't actually predict it beforehand.\n\n2. **Confirmation bias**: This is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. Essentially, it's seeing what you want to see and ignoring evidence that contradicts your view.\n\n3. **Functional fixedness**: This is a type of mental set that interferes with problem-solving. It involves seeing objects only in terms of their usual functions, which can prevent finding new uses for them.\n\n4. **Proactive interference**: This is when previously learned information hinders the recall of newly learned information. It's a type of memory interference where old memories get in the way of acquiring or recalling new ones.\n\nGiven this, let's see which one fits Shafi's situation.\n\nShafi has a belief that boys do better in math than girls. He cites the example of Tony and David getting 100% as evidence for this belief. However, he fails to acknowledge that seven girls also got 100%, and in fact, more girls achieved that score than boys (two boys versus seven girls).\n\nSo, Shafi is selectively focusing on the boys who did well while ignoring the girls who did even better. This suggests that he's only considering information that confirms his belief that boys are better at math and disregarding evidence that contradicts it.\n\nLet's check which bias this aligns with:\n\n- **Hindsight bias**: Doesn't seem to fit because there isn't an event that has occurred, and then he's claiming he knew it all along. He's just making a generalization based on some test scores.\n\n- **Confirmation bias**: This seems plausible. He's confirming his existing belief by focusing on the boys who did well and ignoring the girls who did even better.\n\n- **Functional fixedness**: This doesn't apply here because it's about seeing objects only in their typical uses, which isn't relevant to this scenario.\n\n- **Proactive interference**: Also not applicable here, as it pertains to memory issues with new information being interfered with by old information.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate choice is **confirmation bias**.\n\nJust to make sure, let's think about it a bit more.\n\nIs there any chance that Shafi might be exhibiting another bias here?\n\nWell, maybe he's not considering the full picture, but is that because he's fixed on his belief about boys and girls in math? That still points towards confirmation bias.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he's overgeneralizing based on a small sample size, but that's more of a statistical error than a psychological bias listed here.\n\nWait, maybe **hindsight bias** could be involved if he's thinking, \"I always knew boys are better in math,\" after seeing these scores. But the description doesn't explicitly mention that he's claiming to have known the outcome beforehand. He's just making a general statement based on the scores, not reflecting back on a specific event.\n\n**Functional fixedness** doesn't fit because it's about the use of objects, not about categorizing people based on gender and academic performance.\n\n**Proactive interference** also doesn't apply here, as it's about memory recall issues, not about interpreting data.\n\nSo, after considering all options, **confirmation bias** seems to be the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
