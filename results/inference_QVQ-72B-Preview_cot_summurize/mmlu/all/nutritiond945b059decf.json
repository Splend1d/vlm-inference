                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Infants born to mothers who are vegan may be at increased risk of deficiency of which nutrient?\" And the options are Vitamin C, Folate, Vitamin B12, and Calcium. Hmm, I need to think about this carefully.\n\nFirst off, I know that a vegan diet excludes all animal products, including meat, dairy, and eggs. So, for a mother who is vegan, she's relying solely on plant-based foods for her nutrition. Now, during pregnancy, it's crucial that the mother gets all the necessary nutrients to support the growing baby's development. Sometimes, certain nutrients can be harder to come by in a vegan diet, especially those that are typically found in animal products.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A is Vitamin C. Vitamin C is abundant in many fruits and vegetables, like oranges, strawberries, bell peppers, and leafy greens. So, even on a vegan diet, it's pretty easy to get plenty of Vitamin C. I don't think this is the one.\n\nOption B is Folate. Folate is another nutrient that's plentiful in plant-based foods. Think leafy greens, beans, lentils, avocados, and fortified cereals. While it's important for neural tube development in the baby, I don't believe there's a heightened risk of folate deficiency in vegan mothers as long as they're eating a varied and balanced diet.\n\nOption C is Vitamin B12. Now, this one rings a bell. I recall that Vitamin B12 is primarily found in animal products like meat, dairy, and eggs. Plants don't naturally produce B12, so for vegans, getting enough B12 can be a challenge unless they take supplements or eat fortified foods. During pregnancy, B12 is essential for the baby's brain and nerve development. If the mother doesn't have enough B12 in her diet, the baby might be at risk of deficiency.\n\nOption D is Calcium. Calcium is important for building strong bones and teeth in the baby. While dairy is a common source of calcium, there are plenty of plant-based sources too, like leafy greens, tofu, fortified plant milks, and nuts. So, while it might require some planning, a vegan mother can get adequate calcium with the right food choices.\n\nConsidering all this, I think Vitamin B12 is the most likely nutrient that infants born to vegan mothers might be at increased risk of deficiency. The other options\u2014Vitamin C, Folate, and Calcium\u2014are generally easier to obtain through a well-planned vegan diet.\n\nJust to double-check, I remember reading that B12 deficiency in vegan mothers can lead to low B12 levels in breast milk, which can then affect the baby if breastfeeding. That further supports the idea that B12 is a critical nutrient to monitor in vegan pregnancies.\n\nSo, my answer is C. Vitamin B12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Vitamin B12}} \\]"
