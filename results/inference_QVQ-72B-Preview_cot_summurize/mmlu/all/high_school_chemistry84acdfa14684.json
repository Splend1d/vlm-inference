                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I have 0.0025 moles of a weak, monoprotic acid dissolved in 0.250 liters of distilled water, and the resulting solution has a pH of 4.26. I need to find the pKa of this weak acid. The options are 4.26, 8.52, 7.92, and 6.52.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a weak, monoprotic acid is. A monoprotic acid is an acid that can donate only one proton (H+) per molecule. Examples include acetic acid (CH3COOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl), but since it's specified as a weak acid, it doesn't completely ionize in solution.\n\nThe dissociation of a weak acid in water can be represented as:\n\nHA + H2O \u21cc H3O+ + A-\n\nWhere HA is the acid, H3O+ is the hydronium ion, and A- is the conjugate base.\n\nSince it's a weak acid, the ionization is partial, and we can set up an equilibrium expression to relate the concentrations of the species involved.\n\nThe acid dissociation constant, Ka, is defined as:\n\nKa = [H3O+][A-] / [HA]\n\nAnd the pKa is just the negative logarithm of Ka:\n\npKa = -log(Ka)\n\nI know the initial amount of acid and the volume, so I can calculate the initial concentration of HA:\n\n[HA]initial = (0.0025 mol) / (0.250 L) = 0.010 M\n\nBut since the acid is weak and only partially ionizes, the equilibrium concentration of HA will be less than 0.010 M.\n\nI also know the pH of the solution, which is 4.26. pH is defined as:\n\npH = -log[H3O+]\n\nSo,\n\n[H3O+] = 10^-4.26 \u2248 5.45 \u00d7 10^-5 M\n\nThis means that at equilibrium, the concentration of H3O+ ions is approximately 5.45 \u00d7 10^-5 M.\n\nNow, since the acid is monoprotic, for every HA that ionizes, one H3O+ and one A- are produced. Therefore, at equilibrium:\n\n[H3O+] = [A-] \u2248 5.45 \u00d7 10^-5 M\n\nAnd\n\n[HA] \u2248 0.010 M - 5.45 \u00d7 10^-5 M \u2248 0.0099455 M\n\nNow, I can plug these values into the Ka expression:\n\nKa = (5.45 \u00d7 10^-5)(5.45 \u00d7 10^-5) / (0.0099455)\n\nWait, actually, I think I should use the equilibrium constant expression properly.\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\n\nKa = [H3O+][A-] / [HA]\n\nAssuming x is the amount of acid that ionized, then:\n\n[H3O+] = [A-] = x\n\n[HA] = initial [HA] - x = 0.010 - x\n\nSo,\n\nKa = x^2 / (0.010 - x)\n\nGiven that x is much smaller than 0.010 (which is often the case for weak acids), we can approximate 0.010 - x \u2248 0.010\n\nBut to be precise, I should use the exact value.\n\nBut first, let's check if the approximation holds.\n\nGiven that x \u2248 5.45 \u00d7 10^-5 M and 0.010 M is much larger than that, the approximation should be acceptable.\n\nSo, Ka \u2248 (5.45 \u00d7 10^-5)^2 / 0.010\n\nCalculate that:\n\n(5.45 \u00d7 10^-5)^2 = 2.97025 \u00d7 10^-9\n\nDivide by 0.010:\n\nKa \u2248 2.97025 \u00d7 10^-7\n\nNow, pKa = -log(2.97025 \u00d7 10^-7) \u2248 6.527\n\nLooking back at the options, the closest one is D. 6.52.\n\nBut wait, let's verify if the approximation was indeed valid.\n\nCalculate Ka using exact values.\n\nGiven x = [H3O+] = 5.45 \u00d7 10^-5 M\n\n[HA] = 0.010 M - 5.45 \u00d7 10^-5 M = 0.0099455 M\n\nKa = (5.45 \u00d7 10^-5)^2 / 0.0099455\n\nCalculate numerator: (5.45 \u00d7 10^-5)^2 = 2.97025 \u00d7 10^-9\n\nDivide by 0.0099455:\n\n2.97025 \u00d7 10^-9 / 0.0099455 \u2248 2.986 \u00d7 10^-7\n\nThen pKa = -log(2.986 \u00d7 10^-7) \u2248 6.527, which rounds to 6.53.\n\nSo, the approximation was acceptable, and the pKa is approximately 6.52.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 6.52.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula that relates pH and pKa for a weak acid:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nThis is the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nGiven pH = 4.26, and I can express [A-] and [HA] in terms of x, where x is the degree of ionization.\n\nBut since I already have [H3O+] and can calculate Ka directly, the previous method seems sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\n4.26 = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nBut I don't know [A-] and [HA] directly.\n\nWait, from the previous calculation, [A-] \u2248 x = 5.45 \u00d7 10^-5 M\n\nAnd [HA] \u2248 0.010 - x = 0.0099455 M\n\nSo,\n\n4.26 = pKa + log(5.45 \u00d7 10^-5 / 0.0099455)\n\nCalculate the ratio:\n\n5.45 \u00d7 10^-5 / 0.0099455 \u2248 0.00548\n\nlog(0.00548) \u2248 -2.26\n\nTherefore,\n\n4.26 = pKa - 2.26\n\nAdd 2.26 to both sides:\n\npKa \u2248 4.26 + 2.26 = 6.52\n\nWhich matches the previous result.\n\nTherefore, the pKa is approximately 6.52, which corresponds to option D.\n\nSo, the answer is D. 6.52\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
