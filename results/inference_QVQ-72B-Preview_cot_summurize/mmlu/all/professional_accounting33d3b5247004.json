                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what should be included in a practitioner's report on the application of agreed-upon procedures. I have four options here, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an agreed-upon procedures engagement is. From what I recall, it's a type of assurance engagement where the practitioner performs specific procedures agreed upon by specified parties, usually to report findings based on those procedures without providing an opinion or conclusion on the subject matter.\n\nSo, in this kind of engagement, the practitioner doesn't express an opinion or provide negative assurance; instead, they simply report the factual findings based on the procedures performed.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that the practitioner performed an examination of prospective financial statements. Hmm, that sounds like a different type of engagement. An examination of prospective financial statements is more about projecting future financial positions or results of operations, and it involves a higher level of assurance than an agreed-upon procedures engagement. I don't think this is the right choice.\n\nOption B mentions a statement of scope limitation that will qualify the practitioner's opinion. But in an agreed-upon procedures engagement, the practitioner doesn't express an opinion; they only report the results of the procedures performed. So, including a statement that qualifies an opinion doesn't seem appropriate here because there's no opinion being expressed in the first place.\n\nOption C refers to a statement mentioning standards established by the AICPA, which is the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. As a practitioner, I would be expected to adhere to certain professional standards set by recognized bodies like the AICPA. Therefore, including a reference to AICPA standards in the report would indicate that the procedures were performed in accordance with these recognized standards. This seems plausible.\n\nOption D talks about a statement of negative assurance based on procedures performed. Negative assurance is typically provided in review engagements, where the practitioner performs limited procedures and states whether anything came to their attention that causes them to believe the financial statements are not prepared in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. However, in an agreed-upon procedures engagement, the practitioner is not providing assurance on the subject matter but is simply reporting the results of the agreed-upon procedures. Therefore, providing negative assurance would not be appropriate in this context.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option C seems to be the correct choice. The practitioner should include a statement referring to standards established by the AICPA in their report on the application of agreed-upon procedures.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. I remember that in agreed-upon procedures engagements, the practitioner's report should:\n\n1. Clearly identify the procedures performed.\n\n2. Present the detailed findings from those procedures.\n\n3. Refer to the standards followed, such as those established by the AICPA.\n\n4. State that the engagement was performed in accordance with the applicable standards.\n\nThere should be no expression of an opinion or negative assurance, as that would be beyond the scope of an agreed-upon procedures engagement.\n\nTherefore, option C is indeed the correct statement to include in the practitioner's report.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
