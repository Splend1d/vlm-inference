                    "text": "So I've got this question about the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The options are:\n\nA. It allows for trial by jury in common-law cases.\n\nB. It grants voting rights to all American women.\n\nC. It lowers the legal voting age from 21 to 18.\n\nD. It reserves powers to the states.\n\nI need to figure out which one is correctly describing the purpose of the Tenth Amendment.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what the Tenth Amendment actually says. I remember that it's part of the Bill of Rights, which were the first ten amendments to the Constitution. The Tenth Amendment deals with the division of powers between the federal government and the states.\n\nLet me think about the exact wording. I think it says something like, \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\"\n\nSo, based on that, it seems like the Tenth Amendment is all about reserving powers that aren't specifically given to the federal government by the Constitution, nor prohibited to the states, to the states themselves or to the individual people.\n\nOkay, so that would mean that any powers not explicitly granted to the federal government are left to the states or to the people.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. It allows for trial by jury in common-law cases.\n\nHmm, I think there's another amendment that deals with trial by jury. Let me see. Oh, the Seventh Amendment deals with the right to a jury trial in certain civil cases. So, that would be the Seventh Amendment, not the Tenth. So, option A is probably not correct.\n\nB. It grants voting rights to all American women.\n\nThat sounds familiar. I think that's the Nineteenth Amendment, which was ratified in 1920, giving women the right to vote. So, that's not the Tenth Amendment. The Tenth Amendment is much older, part of the original Bill of Rights from 1791.\n\nC. It lowers the legal voting age from 21 to 18.\n\nI recall that the Twenty-sixth Amendment changed the voting age to 18 in 1971. So, again, that's not the Tenth Amendment.\n\nD. It reserves powers to the states.\n\nThat seems to align with what I remember about the Tenth Amendment. It's about reserving powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option D seems to be the correct description of the Tenth Amendment's purpose.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check each option quickly:\n\n- A: Trial by jury in common-law cases \u2013 that's the Seventh Amendment.\n\n- B: Voting rights for women \u2013 that's the Nineteenth Amendment.\n\n- C: Lowering the voting age to 18 \u2013 that's the Twenty-sixth Amendment.\n\n- D: Reserving powers to the states \u2013 that's the Tenth Amendment.\n\nYes, I'm confident that D is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, the question says, \"It allows for trial by jury in common-law cases.\" I think there might be a slight confusion in the wording. In the Seventh Amendment, it's about the right to a jury trial in civil cases where the value in controversy exceeds twenty dollars. So, it's not exactly \"common-law cases,\" but civil cases above a certain amount.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, I should stick to what I know about the Tenth Amendment. It's about reserving powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: It reserves powers to the states.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
