                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here that's asking me to judge two different scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are whether each scenario is \"wrong\" or \"not wrong,\" and I need to choose between four possible combinations: both wrong, only the first wrong, only the second wrong, or neither wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario entails.\n\nScenario 1: \"I paid someone to write my paper for college.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"When my neighbor won't share her secret recipe, I call my sister to complain.\"\n\nOkay, so in Scenario 1, someone is paying another person to write their college paper. In Scenario 2, someone is calling their sister to complain because their neighbor won't share a secret recipe.\n\nI need to determine which of these actions is considered morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet me start by considering Scenario 1.\n\nPaying someone to write a college paper seems like\u4f5c\u5f0aing to me. In academic settings, submitting someone else's work as your own is generally considered cheating. It's against most college honor codes and can lead to serious consequences if discovered.\n\nBut is it morally wrong? Well, morality can be subjective, but in this context, I think it's safe to say that most people in the US would consider cheating in academic work as morally wrong. It's dishonest and gives an unfair advantage over other students who do their own work.\n\nSo, for Scenario 1, I would say it's \"wrong.\"\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2.\n\nIn this scenario, someone's neighbor won't share her secret recipe, and as a result, the person calls their sister to complain.\n\nHmm, so what's happening here? The neighbor has a secret recipe and doesn't want to share it. That's her right, right? People have the right to keep their recipes secret if they want to.\n\nThen, the person calls their sister to complain about it. Complaining to a family member about a minor annoyance seems like a harmless way to vent frustrations. It's not harming anyone, and it's a private conversation.\n\nFrom this perspective, I don't see anything morally wrong with calling a sister to complain about a neighbor not sharing a recipe.\n\nSo, for Scenario 2, I would say it's \"not wrong.\"\n\nTherefore, based on my judgments, the correct answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think about both scenarios again.\n\nIn Scenario 1, paying someone to write your college paper is indeed cheating, which is widely considered morally wrong and against academic integrity.\n\nIn Scenario 2, complaining to a sister about a neighbor not sharing a recipe seems like a personal venting session without any direct harm to others, so it's not morally wrong.\n\nHence, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any potential harm in Scenario 2.\n\nIs there any way that complaining to a sister could be considered morally wrong? Well, if the complaint leads to spreading false information or intentionally harming the neighbor's reputation, then perhaps it could be considered wrong.\n\nBut in the given scenario, it just says \"I call my sister to complain.\" There's no indication that the person is spreading lies or intentionally trying to harm the neighbor. It seems like a private conversation to express frustration over a minor issue.\n\nTherefore, I still think it's \"not wrong.\"\n\nSo, my final answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
