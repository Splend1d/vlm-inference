                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about different types of retailers. It says: \"Which type of retailer involves comparatively low prices as a major selling point combined with the reduced costs of doing business?\" And the options are A. Discount retailers, B. Convenience stores, C. Category killer stores, and D. Limited line retailers.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what each type of retailer is known for, especially in terms of pricing and cost structures.\n\nStarting with discount retailers (option A), I recall that these are stores that offer products at lower prices than traditional retailers. They often achieve this by having a no-frills approach, meaning fewer services, simpler stores, and higher volume sales. Places like Aldi or Lidl come to mind. They focus on efficiency and cost-cutting measures to offer competitive prices. So, this seems like a strong candidate for the description in the question.\n\nNext, convenience stores (option B). These are typically small stores located in accessible places, like gas stations or high-traffic areas. They offer a limited selection of goods, focusing on items people might need on short notice, like snacks, drinks, and basic household items. Convenience stores are known for their extended hours and easy access, but their prices are generally higher than those in supermarkets or discount stores because of the convenience factor. So, this doesn't seem to fit the description of offering comparatively low prices as a major selling point.\n\nMoving on to category killer stores (option C). These are large retailers that specialize in a particular product category and offer a wide selection within that category, often at lower prices than traditional retailers. Examples include Best Buy for electronics or Home Depot for home improvement. They can offer lower prices because of their size and purchasing power, allowing them to negotiate better deals with suppliers. However, the question mentions \"reduced costs of doing business,\" which might be more closely associated with discount retailers' operational efficiencies.\n\nLastly, limited line retailers (option D). I think this refers to stores that offer a limited range of products, perhaps focusing on a specific type of goods. For example, a store that only sells books or only sells shoes. These retailers might offer competitive prices within their limited product lines, but they might not necessarily have the same cost advantages as discount retailers or category killers due to their narrower focus.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, discount retailers (A) seem to fit the description best. They are known for offering low prices as a major selling point and achieve this through reduced operating costs, such as simpler store designs, fewer staff, and high turnover of inventory.\n\nBut let me double-check. Category killer stores do offer lower prices, but their primary advantage is their extensive selection in a particular category, not necessarily the lowest prices overall. Limited line retailers focus on a specific type of product and may offer good prices within that line, but again, their cost structures might not be as streamlined as those of discount retailers.\n\nConvenience stores, as mentioned earlier, actually charge higher prices due to their emphasis on convenience and accessibility.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer should be A. Discount retailers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
