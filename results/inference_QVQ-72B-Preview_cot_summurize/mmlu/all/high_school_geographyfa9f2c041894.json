                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this world systems theory. It's about how the world is divided, right? The question is asking how the world is divided according to this theory. The options are:\n\nA. core, periphery, and semi-periphery.\n\nB. rich and poor.\n\nC. developed and undeveloped.\n\nD. haves and have-nots.\n\nHmm, at first glance, options B, C, and D seem pretty similar, talking about wealth and development differences. But option A seems more specific, maybe relating to specific regions or economic roles in the global system.\n\nLet me think about this. I recall that the world systems theory is a way of looking at how countries relate to each other economically and politically. It was developed by Immanuel Wallerstein, I think. He proposed that the world economy has a structure that benefits some countries while disadvantaging others.\n\nSo, in this framework, countries are categorized based on their position in the global economic system. Let's see, the terms \"core,\" \"periphery,\" and \"semi-periphery\" sound familiar. I think \"core\" countries are the most industrialized and economically powerful, \"periphery\" countries are less developed and often depend on the core countries, and \"semi-periphery\" countries are somewhere in between, maybe having some industrialization but still relying on relationships with core countries.\n\nThat sounds like a specific classification system, which matches option A.\n\nOption B is \"rich and poor.\" While that's a general way to categorize countries based on their wealth, it's quite broad and doesn't capture the nuances of their roles in the global economy.\n\nOption C is \"developed and undeveloped.\" This is similar to option B but focuses more on the level of development, which could include factors like industrialization, infrastructure, education, etc. However, in world systems theory, the focus is more on the relationships and dependencies between countries, not just their development levels.\n\nOption D is \"haves and have-nots.\" This seems to refer to countries that have resources and those that don't. Again, while this touches on economic disparities, it doesn't capture the structural relationships that world systems theory emphasizes.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems the most accurate because it refers directly to the specific categories used in world systems theory to describe the divisions and relationships between different parts of the global economy.\n\nWait, but I should make sure. Maybe I should look it up to confirm. Let me search for \"world systems theory divisions.\"\n\nOkay, according to various sources, world systems theory does indeed divide the world into core, periphery, and semi-periphery regions. The core countries are the affluent, industrialized countries that dominate global trade and politics. The periphery countries are the less developed, often agrarian economies that are dependent on the core countries for trade and sometimes aid. The semi-periphery countries are those that have some characteristics of both the core and periphery; they might be industrializing but still depend on the core countries in various ways.\n\nSo, this matches perfectly with option A.\n\nOptions B, C, and D, while they touch on aspects of economic differences between countries, don't capture the specific categorizations used in world systems theory.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. core, periphery, and semi-periphery.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check another source. Yep, consistent across different references. World systems theory is all about understanding the hierarchical structure of the global economy, with these three main divisions.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
