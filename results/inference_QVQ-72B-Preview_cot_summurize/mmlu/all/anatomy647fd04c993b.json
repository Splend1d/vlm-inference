Testes.\n\nLet me just quickly explain why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Glans penis: This is the sensitive tip of the penis and is involved in sexual arousal and sensation, but it doesn't produce hormones.\n\nB. Prepuce: This is the foreskin that covers the glans in an uncircumcised penis. It doesn't produce hormones either.\n\nC. Prostate: The prostate gland is involved in producing fluids that make up semen, but it doesn't produce male hormones like testosterone.\n\nD. Testes: These are the male gonads located outside the body in the scrotum. They are responsible for producing both sperm and testosterone.\n\nSo, yeah, the testes are the primary producers of male hormones.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
