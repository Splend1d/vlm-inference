                    "text": "Let's see here. So, in year 6, an IRS agent finished checking a corporation's year 5 tax return and wants to adjust it, which will also affect years 1 through year 5. The adjustment is about not allowing the use of a corporate jet for personal reasons. The agent doesn't think this is fraud or a big mistake on purpose. I need to figure out which statement about this adjustment is correct.\n\nOption A says the adjustment is improper because agents can only propose changes to the year they're examining. But that doesn't sound right. If something affects multiple years, shouldn't they be able to adjust those years too?\n\nOption B says the adjustment is proper because there's no time limit for fixing mistakes about personal expenses being claimed as business expenses. Is that true? I thought there were generally time limits for audits, like three years from when the return was filed.\n\nOption C says the adjustment is proper because it's about changing an accounting method, and that can be done retroactively no matter the time limit. But is using a corporate jet for personal reasons considered an accounting method change? I'm not so sure.\n\nOption D says the adjustment is improper because the time to make changes has run out for some of the years involved. If all returns were filed on time, and now it's year 6, looking back to year 1, that's quite a few years. Normally, the IRS has three years to audit a return, right? So, for year 1, which was filed, say, in year 2, the three-year limit would have been up by year 5. So, maybe for some years, the time has run out.\n\nWait, but the adjustment is proposed in year 6, affecting years 1 through 5. So, for year 5, filed in year 6, the return is still within the three-year window. But for year 1, filed in year 2, the three-year window would have closed by year 5. So, maybe for years 1 through, say, year 3, the time has run out, but for years 4 and 5, it hasn't.\n\nBut the question says \"for each of years 1 through year 5,\" so it's affecting all those years. So, if the time limit has expired for some of those years, then maybe the whole adjustment is improper.\n\nBut option D says \"the statute of limitations has expired for several years of the adjustment.\" That seems to align with what I'm thinking. So, perhaps the adjustment is improper because the time has run out for some of the years.\n\nWait, but option B says there's no statute of limitations for improperly claiming personal expenses as business expenses. Is that a thing? I thought generally, the statute of limitations for IRS audits is three years from the filing date, unless there's fraud involved, in which case there's no time limit. But here, the agent doesn't find the error to be fraudulent or substantial.\n\nSo, if it's not fraudulent, does the normal three-year statute apply? And since some of the years are beyond that three-year window, maybe the adjustment can't be made for those years.\n\nBut option B seems to suggest that there's no statute of limitations for personal expenses improperly claimed as business expenses. Is that accurate? I'm not sure.\n\nLet me look this up. Oh, wait, I'm supposed to answer based on what I know. Hmm.\n\nI recall that generally, the IRS has three years from the filing date to propose adjustments unless there's fraud involved. Since fraud isn't an issue here, the three-year rule should apply.\n\nSo, if the returns were all filed on time, and now it's year 6, looking back to year 1, which was filed in year 2, the three-year window would have closed by year 5. So, for year 1, the IRS can't make changes now.\n\nSimilarly, year 2 was filed in year 3, so by year 6, that's three years plus, so probably can't adjust that either.\n\nYear 3 was filed in year 4, so by year 6, that's two years past the three-year window.\n\nYear 4 was filed in year 5, so by year 6, that's one year past the three-year window.\n\nYear 5 was filed in year 6, so it's still within the three-year window.\n\nSo, for years 1 through 4, the time to make changes has expired, but for year 5, it hasn't.\n\nSo, if the agent is proposing an adjustment that affects all these years, but the time has run out for years 1 through 4, then perhaps the adjustment is improper for those years.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The adjustment is improper because an agent may only propose adjustments to the year under examination.\n\nWell, the examination is of year 5, but the adjustment affects prior years. So, maybe A is suggesting that agents can't propose adjustments to prior years based on a current examination. But that doesn't seem right, because sometimes adjustments can span multiple years.\n\nB. The adjustment is proper because there is no statute of limitations for improperly claiming personal expenses as business expenses.\n\nBut, as I thought earlier, unless there's fraud, the general statute of limitations should apply. So, if there's no fraud, then the three-year rule applies, meaning some of the years are out of time.\n\nC. The adjustment is proper because it relates to a change in accounting method, which can be made retroactively irrespective of the statute of limitations.\n\nBut is this about a change in accounting method? It sounds more like disallowing a specific expense, not a change in how the company accounts for things in general.\n\nD. The adjustment is improper because the statute of limitations has expired for several years of the adjustment.\n\nThis seems to align with my earlier thinking. Some of the years are out of the three-year window, so adjustments for those years would be improper.\n\nSo, between the options, D seems to be the most accurate based on my understanding.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any exception for personal expenses being claimed as business expenses that would allow the IRS to adjust returns outside the normal statute of limitations?\n\nI don't think so. Generally, unless there's fraud, the three-year rule applies. So, if the agent isn't finding fraud or substantial understatements, the normal time limits should apply.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is D: The adjustment is improper because the statute of limitations has expired for several years of the adjustment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
