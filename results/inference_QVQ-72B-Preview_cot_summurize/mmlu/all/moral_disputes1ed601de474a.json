                    "text": " So I'm trying to understand this argument against autonomy-based justifications for euthanasia. The question says that Michael Gill discusses arguments against these justifications, and that they're contradictory for certain reasons. The options are:\n\nA. The value of autonomy relates only to the making of big decisions.\n\nB. Terminally ill patients are not capable of freely choosing to end their own lives.\n\nC. Killing a person destroys his or her ability to make autonomous decisions.\n\nD. All of the above.\n\nI need to figure out which of these reasons make the autonomy-based justifications contradictory.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand what autonomy-based justifications for euthanasia are. Autonomy in ethics usually refers to an individual's right to make their own choices about their life, free from coercion or undue influence. In the context of euthanasia, which is the practice of ending a person's life to eliminate pain and suffering, autonomy-based justifications would support the right of a person, especially if they're terminally ill, to choose to end their own life.\n\nNow, the argument is that these justifications are contradictory. A contradiction means that something is logically inconsistent or impossible to be true at the same time.\n\nLet's look at option A: \"The value of autonomy relates only to the making of big decisions.\"\n\nI'm not sure about this one. Autonomy is generally valued in making all kinds of decisions, not just big ones. We value people's ability to make choices about their daily lives as well as major life decisions. So, if autonomy is only valued for big decisions, that might be a specific view, but it's not a widely held one. Maybe this isn't the best reason for the contradiction.\n\nOption B: \"Terminally ill patients are not capable of freely choosing to end their own lives.\"\n\nThis seems like a common argument against euthanasia. The idea is that when someone is facing death, they might be depressed, in pain, or under duress, which could affect their ability to make a truly free and informed decision. If that's the case, then supporting euthanasia based on autonomy could be contradictory because the patient might not be exercising genuine autonomy.\n\nBut, on the other hand, proponents of euthanasia might argue that with proper safeguards, such as requiring the patient to be of sound mind and to have made a voluntary and informed decision, euthanasia can still be consistent with autonomy.\n\nSo, this seems like a plausible reason for the contradiction, but it's not necessarily a given that all terminally ill patients lack the capacity for autonomous decision-making.\n\nOption C: \"Killing a person destroys his or her ability to make autonomous decisions.\"\n\nThis one seems straightforward. If euthanasia involves ending someone's life, once they're dead, they can't make any more decisions. So, by choosing euthanasia, they're forfeiting their future autonomy. This could be seen as a contradiction because, in exercising their autonomy to choose euthanasia, they're eliminating their own future autonomy.\n\nThis seems like a strong argument against autonomy-based justifications for euthanasia. It's often referred to as the \"autonomy objection\" to euthanasia.\n\nGiven that, option C seems like a solid reason for the contradiction.\n\nNow, considering all three options, which one is correct?\n\nOption A seems less convincing because autonomy is generally valued in all decisions, not just big ones.\n\nOption B is a possible argument, but it's not necessarily always true that terminally ill patients can't make autonomous decisions.\n\nOption C, however, presents a clear logical contradiction: choosing euthanasia destroys one's own future autonomy.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. Killing a person destroys his or her ability to make autonomous decisions.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"the value of autonomy relates only to the making of big decisions.\" Is that what option A says? Let me double-check.\n\nOption A says, \"the value of autonomy relates only to the making of big decisions.\" Hmm, actually, I think I misread it earlier. It says \"the value of autonomy relates only to the making of big decisions.\" So, it's suggesting that autonomy is only valued in big decisions.\n\nBut in ethical theory, autonomy is valued in all decisions, not just the big ones. So, if option A is saying that autonomy is only valued in big decisions, that might be a misunderstanding.\n\nMaybe the point is that euthanasia is a big decision, and autonomy is particularly important in such decisions. But that doesn't seem like a contradiction in itself.\n\nOption B is about the capacity of terminally ill patients to make autonomous decisions, which is a separate issue.\n\nOption C is about the inherent contradiction in choosing euthanasia because it ends one's ability to make future autonomous decisions.\n\nGiven that, I think option C is the most accurate reason for the contradiction.\n\nBut the question says \"according to these arguments,\" which suggests that the arguments against autonomy-based justifications for euthanasia might consider multiple reasons.\n\nHowever, based on the options, it seems that option D (\"all of the above\") might be tempting, but if I think option A is not a strong reason, then D wouldn't be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the argument against autonomy-based justifications is that they are contradictory for multiple reasons, and D is the correct choice.\n\nBut based on my earlier analysis, I'm not fully convinced that A and B are necessarily contradictions in the same way that C is.\n\nOption C presents a clear logical contradiction: choosing euthanasia destroys one's future autonomy.\n\nOption B is more about the capacity of the patient to make an autonomous decision, which is an empirical question rather than a logical contradiction.\n\nOption A seems to be a misunderstanding of the nature of autonomy.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. Killing a person destroys his or her ability to make autonomous decisions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
