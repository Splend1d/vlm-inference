I remember that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. To find it, I can list the factors of each number and then identify the largest one they have in common.\n\nFirst, let's list the factors of 42. The factors of 42 are:\n\n1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42\n\nNow, let's list the factors of 84. The factors of 84 are:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, 84\n\nNext, I need to find the common factors from both lists. Looking at the lists:\n\n1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42\n\nFrom these, the common factors are:\n\n1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42\n\nSo, the greatest common factor is the largest number in this list, which is 42.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Is there a quicker way to confirm this? I know that if one number is a factor of another, then the smaller number is a common factor. Here, 42 is a factor of itself and also a factor of 84, since 84 divided by 42 is 2. So, yes, 42 is indeed a common factor.\n\nLet me see if there's a larger number that could be a factor of both. Well, 84 is larger than 42, but 84 isn't a factor of 42; in fact, 84 divided by 42 is 2, which means 42 is a factor of 84, but 84 isn't a factor of 42. So, 84 can't be the GCF.\n\nIs there any number larger than 42 that could be a common factor? Well, any number larger than 42 would be greater than the smaller of the two numbers, which is 42. So, the GCF can't be larger than 42. Therefore, 42 is indeed the greatest common factor.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if 42 divides both numbers evenly:\n\n42 \u00f7 42 = 1 (no remainder)\n\n84 \u00f7 42 = 2 (no remainder)\n\nSo, it checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the prime factorization method to find the GCF. Let's try that to confirm.\n\nFirst, find the prime factors of each number.\n\nPrime factors of 42:\n\n42 \u00f7 2 = 21 (2 is a prime factor)\n\n21 \u00f7 3 = 7 (3 and 7 are prime factors)\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 42 is 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7.\n\nPrime factors of 84:\n\n84 \u00f7 2 = 42 (2 is a prime factor)\n\n42 \u00f7 2 = 21 (another 2)\n\n21 \u00f7 3 = 7 (3 and 7 are prime factors)\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 84 is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7.\n\nTo find the GCF, I take the lowest power of each common prime factor. The common prime factors are 2, 3, and 7.\n\nSo, GCF = 2^1 \u00d7 3^1 \u00d7 7^1 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7 = 42.\n\nThis matches what I found earlier using the factor listing method. Therefore, I'm confident that 42 is the correct GCF.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 7\n\nB. 21\n\nC. 42\n\nD. 84\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 42.\n\nWait, but let's make sure I'm not missing something. Is there any possibility that 84 could be considered? No, because 84 isn't a factor of 42. Even though 42 is a factor of 84, 84 is not a factor of 42. So, 84 can't be the GCF.\n\nAlso, 7 and 21 are factors of both numbers, but they are smaller than 42, so they are not the greatest common factor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 42.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
