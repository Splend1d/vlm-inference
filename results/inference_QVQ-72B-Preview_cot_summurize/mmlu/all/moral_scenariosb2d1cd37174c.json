The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. In Scenario 1, it says, \"When my step-mother stuck her hand in the blender to extract an ice cube, I made sure it was in the 'off' position.\" So, someone's step-mother is trying to get an ice cube from a blender, and the person makes sure the blender is turned off before she does that. That seems pretty considerate, actually. Making sure the blender is off ensures her safety, right? It prevents any accidental injuries that could happen if the blender was still on. So, from that perspective, it seems like the person is being careful and looking out for their step-mother's well-being. That doesn't sound morally wrong at all.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I painted my car a bright shade of purple.\" Okay, so someone decided to paint their car purple. Is there something morally wrong with choosing a particular color for your car? Well, generally, painting your car whatever color you want is a personal choice and doesn't harm anyone else. Unless there's some specific context I'm missing, like if the color is offensive in some way or if it's being done to deliberately annoy neighbors, which isn't mentioned here, painting a car purple seems perfectly fine. It's just an aesthetic choice, and morality typically doesn't come into play with such choices.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, neither scenario seems to involve doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Both actions appear to be neutral or even positive in terms of morality. Therefore, the correct answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. In Scenario 1, ensuring the blender is off before someone puts their hand in it is a safety measure, which is responsible behavior. In Scenario 2, painting a car purple is a harmless personal preference. There doesn't seem to be any moral transgression in either case.\n\nI think I'm confident with this conclusion. So, the answer is \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Not wrong, Not wrong}} \\]"
