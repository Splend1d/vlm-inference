Family and friends. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is the most accurate term for people who have survived the loss of someone else.\n\nFirst, let's think about option A: Survivors. When I hear the word \"survivor,\" I usually think of someone who has endured a difficult situation and come out alive, like survivors of a natural disaster or a serious illness. In the context of losing someone, like a family member or friend, I do hear people refer to themselves as survivors, but I'm not sure if that's the most precise term.\n\nOption B: Grieving. This seems more about the emotional state of the person rather than a label for who they are. Grieving is the process of dealing with the loss, feeling sadness, and working through those emotions. So, while it's true that people who have lost someone are grieving, this might not be the best fit because it's more about the emotion than the identity of the person.\n\nOption C: Bereaved. This one sounds familiar in the context of loss. Bereaved specifically refers to someone who has been deprived of someone else by death, usually a close relative or friend. It seems like a term that directly applies to the situation described in the question.\n\nOption D: Family and friends. This is a bit too broad. While it's true that family and friends are often the ones who survive when someone passes away, not all survivors are necessarily family or friends. There could be other relationships, like coworkers or acquaintances, who also experience the loss but aren't considered family or close friends.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, \"bereaved\" seems to be the most accurate term for those who survive the loss of another person, especially if that person was close to them.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's a more comprehensive term that includes everyone affected by the loss, not just the closest people. \"Survivors\" could potentially include a wider range of people, but as I thought earlier, it feels more general and less specific to the context of death and loss.\n\n\"Bereaved\" really does seem to capture the essence of what the question is asking. It's a term used specifically to describe someone who has experienced the death of a loved one. I think that's the best answer here.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check a dictionary definition. Oh, I don't have a dictionary right now, but I can recall that \"bereaved\" is indeed a term used to describe someone who has suffered a bereavement, which is the loss of a loved one through death.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the correct answer should be C. Bereaved.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
