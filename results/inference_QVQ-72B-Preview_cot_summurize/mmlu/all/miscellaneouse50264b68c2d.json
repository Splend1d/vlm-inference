                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of these foods is poisonous to dogs? A. peanut butter, B. bananas, C. chocolate, D. olives.\" Hmm, I need to figure this out. I love dogs, and I want to make sure I know which foods are safe for them and which ones aren't.\n\nFirst, let's think about peanut butter. I know a lot of people give their dogs peanut butter treats. There are even special dog treats made with peanut butter. Plus, peanut butter is high in protein and has some healthy fats. But is it poisonous? I don't think so. My neighbor has a dog that eats peanut butter from a spoon, and it seems fine. Maybe it's not the best food for dogs in large amounts, but I doubt it's poisonous.\n\nNext, bananas. Bananas are fruits, and generally, fruits are considered healthy for most animals. I've read that dogs can eat bananas, and they're a good source of vitamins and minerals. Sometimes, people even give their dogs frozen bananas as a treat. Again, I haven't heard anything about bananas being poisonous to dogs. Maybe they shouldn't eat too many, but in moderation, they seem safe.\n\nNow, chocolate. Ah, chocolate is a well-known toxin for dogs. I've heard this many times. Chocolate contains a substance called theobromine, which can be toxic to dogs. It can cause symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea, increased thirst, restlessness, and in severe cases, seizures and heart failure. Even small amounts of chocolate can be dangerous, especially in small dogs. So, this is definitely a candidate for the answer.\n\nLastly, olives. Olives are a type of fruit, often used in Mediterranean cuisine. They're high in fat and have a unique flavor. For dogs, I've heard mixed things. Some say that olives are safe for dogs to eat, while others caution against it. Olives can be high in salt and fat, which might not be good for dogs in large quantities. However, I don't think they're inherently poisonous. Maybe they should be given in moderation, but I don't believe they're toxic.\n\nSo, weighing all these options, it seems pretty clear that chocolate is the food that's poisonous to dogs among the given choices. I should remember this because it's important to keep our furry friends safe from harmful substances. Maybe I'll also look up some more information to confirm, but based on what I know, chocolate is definitely a no-no for dogs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. chocolate}} \\]"
