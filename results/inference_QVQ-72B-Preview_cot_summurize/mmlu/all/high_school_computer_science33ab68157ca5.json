                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a variable called age, which is an integer representing a person's age. The rules are:\n\n1. You must be at least 16 years old to drive a car.\n\n2. You must be at least 18 years old to vote.\n\nAnd the question is asking for an expression that evaluates to true if the person is old enough to drive but not old enough to vote. In other words, the person should be at least 16 but less than 18.\n\nSo, let's translate that into a logical statement:\n\nWe want age \u2265 16 AND age < 18.\n\nThat's the condition that should evaluate to true for the scenario described.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nI. (age \u2265 16) AND (age \u2264 18)\n\nThis expression says that age is between 16 and 18, inclusive. But according to the problem, we want people who are at least 16 but less than 18. So, this includes age 18, which we don't want because at age 18, the person can vote, which disqualifies them from the condition of \"not old enough to vote.\"\n\nTherefore, option I is not correct because it includes age 18, which should evaluate to false since the person can vote.\n\nII. (age \u2265 16) AND (NOT(age \u2265 18))\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n- (age \u2265 16): this ensures the person is at least 16.\n\n- NOT(age \u2265 18): this means age is not greater than or equal to 18, so age < 18.\n\nSo, combined, it's (age \u2265 16) AND (age < 18), which matches exactly what we want: age is at least 16 but less than 18.\n\nTherefore, option II is correct.\n\nIII. (age < 18) AND (NOT(age < 16))\n\nLet's analyze this one:\n\n- (age < 18): this means the person is younger than 18.\n\n- NOT(age < 16): this means age is not less than 16, so age \u2265 16.\n\nCombined, it's (age < 18) AND (age \u2265 16), which again is age is at least 16 but less than 18.\n\nSo, option III is also correct.\n\nWait a minute, both II and III seem to give the correct condition for age being at least 16 but less than 18.\n\nBut earlier, we saw that option I, which is (age \u2265 16) AND (age \u2264 18), includes age 18, which we don't want.\n\nSo, among the options, II and III are correct, but I is not.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. II and III only.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure there isn't any mistake.\n\nConsider age = 18:\n\n- I: (18 \u2265 16) AND (18 \u2264 18) \u2192 true\n\n- II: (18 \u2265 16) AND NOT(18 \u2265 18) \u2192 (true) AND NOT(true) \u2192 true AND false \u2192 false\n\n- III: (18 < 18) AND NOT(18 < 16) \u2192 false AND NOT(false) \u2192 false AND true \u2192 false\n\nSo, at age 18, I evaluates to true, while II and III evaluate to false, which aligns with our earlier conclusion that only II and III are correct.\n\nNow, consider age = 17:\n\n- I: (17 \u2265 16) AND (17 \u2264 18) \u2192 true AND true \u2192 true\n\n- II: (17 \u2265 16) AND NOT(17 \u2265 18) \u2192 true AND NOT(true) \u2192 true AND false \u2192 false\n\nWait, that's odd. According to our earlier reasoning, age 17 should satisfy the condition, but in II, it's evaluating to false. Let's check again.\n\nWait, no:\n\nAt age 17:\n\n- (age \u2265 16): true\n\n- NOT(age \u2265 18): NOT(17 \u2265 18) \u2192 NOT(false) \u2192 true\n\nSo, true AND true \u2192 true\n\nBut earlier, I mistakenly wrote that II evaluates to false at age 17, which is incorrect. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, at age 17:\n\n- I: (17 \u2265 16) AND (17 \u2264 18) \u2192 true AND true \u2192 true\n\n- II: (17 \u2265 16) AND NOT(17 \u2265 18) \u2192 true AND NOT(false) \u2192 true AND true \u2192 true\n\n- III: (17 < 18) AND NOT(17 < 16) \u2192 true AND NOT(false) \u2192 true AND true \u2192 true\n\nSimilarly, at age 16:\n\n- I: (16 \u2265 16) AND (16 \u2264 18) \u2192 true AND true \u2192 true\n\n- II: (16 \u2265 16) AND NOT(16 \u2265 18) \u2192 true AND NOT(false) \u2192 true AND true \u2192 true\n\n- III: (16 < 18) AND NOT(16 < 16) \u2192 true AND NOT(false) \u2192 true AND true \u2192 true\n\nAt age 15:\n\n- I: (15 \u2265 16): false AND (15 \u2264 18): true \u2192 false AND true \u2192 false\n\n- II: (15 \u2265 16): false AND NOT(15 \u2265 18): NOT(false) \u2192 false AND true \u2192 false\n\n- III: (15 < 18): true AND NOT(15 < 16): NOT(false) \u2192 true AND true \u2192 true\n\nBut age 15 should not satisfy the condition because they are not old enough to drive (need to be at least 16). So, option III incorrectly evaluates to true at age 15.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nAt age 15, they are not old enough to drive, so the expression should evaluate to false. But according to III, it evaluates to true, which is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, III is not a correct expression for the condition.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought III was correct, but now I see that at age 15, III evaluates to true, which is wrong because age 15 should not satisfy the condition.\n\nSo, III is incorrect.\n\nLet me verify this:\n\nAt age 15:\n\n- They are not old enough to drive (need at least 16) and not old enough to vote (need at least 18). So, the expression should evaluate to false.\n\nBut according to III:\n\n- (15 < 18): true\n\n- NOT(15 < 16): which is NOT(false): true\n\n- So, true AND true \u2192 true\n\nWhich is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, III is not a correct expression for the condition.\n\nOnly II correctly evaluates to true when age \u2265 16 and age < 18, and evaluates to false otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. II only.\n\nI must have made a mistake earlier in thinking that III was correct, but now it's clear that III incorrectly includes ages below 16.\n\nSo, the final answer is A. II only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
