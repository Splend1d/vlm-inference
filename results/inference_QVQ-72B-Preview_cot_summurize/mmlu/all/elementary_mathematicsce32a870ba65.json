                    "text": "Let's see. I need to find the greatest common factor of 36 and 90. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my math, but I think I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I remember that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find all the common factors of 36 and 90 and then pick the biggest one.\n\nMaybe I should list all the factors of each number and then see which ones are common to both.\n\nStarting with 36:\n\n1. 1 (because 1 is a factor of every number)\n\n2. 2 (36 divided by 2 is 18)\n\n3. 3 (36 divided by 3 is 12)\n\n4. 4 (36 divided by 4 is 9)\n\n5. 6 (36 divided by 6 is 6)\n\n6. 9 (36 divided by 9 is 4)\n\n7. 12 (36 divided by 12 is 3)\n\n8. 18 (36 divided by 18 is 2)\n\n9. 36 (36 divided by 36 is 1)\n\nSo, the factors of 36 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.\n\nNow, for 90:\n\n1. 1 (90 divided by 1 is 90)\n\n2. 2 (90 divided by 2 is 45)\n\n3. 3 (90 divided by 3 is 30)\n\n4. 5 (90 divided by 5 is 18)\n\n5. 6 (90 divided by 6 is 15)\n\n6. 9 (90 divided by 9 is 10)\n\n7. 10 (90 divided by 10 is 9)\n\n8. 15 (90 divided by 15 is 6)\n\n9. 18 (90 divided by 18 is 5)\n\n10. 30 (90 divided by 30 is 3)\n\n11. 45 (90 divided by 45 is 2)\n\n12. 90 (90 divided by 90 is 1)\n\nSo, the factors of 90 are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90.\n\nNow, I need to find the common factors between these two lists. Let's list them again:\n\nFactors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36\n\nFactors of 90: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90\n\nCommon factors are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18\n\nSo, the common factors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. Out of these, the greatest one is 18.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Is there a larger number than 18 in both lists? Looking at the factors of 36: 18 is the largest, and in factors of 90, 18 is also present. So, yes, 18 is the greatest common factor.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any larger number that divides both 36 and 90. Let's see, 18 divides 36 (36 \u00f7 18 = 2) and 90 (90 \u00f7 18 = 5), both without remainders. The next number up would be 36, but 90 is not divisible by 36 (90 \u00f7 36 = 2.5), so 36 is not a common factor. Similarly, 90 is not a factor of 36, since 36 \u00f7 90 = 0.4, which is not an integer.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common factor is indeed 18.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6\n\nB. 18\n\nC. 36\n\nD. 180\n\nSo, according to my calculations, the answer should be B. 18.\n\nBut let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using prime factors.\n\nPrime factorization might be a more efficient way.\n\nSo, find the prime factors of each number.\n\nFor 36:\n\n36 \u00f7 2 = 18\n\n18 \u00f7 2 = 9\n\n9 \u00f7 3 = 3\n\n3 \u00f7 3 = 1\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 36 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b2.\n\nFor 90:\n\n90 \u00f7 2 = 45\n\n45 \u00f7 3 = 15\n\n15 \u00f7 3 = 5\n\n5 \u00f7 5 = 1\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 90 is 2 \u00d7 3\u00b2 \u00d7 5.\n\nTo find the GCF, I need to take the lowest power of each common prime factor.\n\nThe common prime factors are 2 and 3.\n\nThe lowest power of 2 in both factorizations is 2\u00b9 (since 36 has 2\u00b2 and 90 has 2\u00b9).\n\nSimilarly, the lowest power of 3 is 3\u00b2 (since both have at least 3\u00b2).\n\nSo, GCF = 2\u00b9 \u00d7 3\u00b2 = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18.\n\nThis matches what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common factor of 36 and 90 is 18.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 6\n\nB. 18\n\nC. 36\n\nD. 180\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 18.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can use another method, like Euclidean algorithm.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm involves dividing the larger number by the smaller number and then replacing the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder, and repeating this process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCF.\n\nSo, for 36 and 90:\n\nLarger number is 90, smaller is 36.\n\nDivide 90 by 36: 90 \u00f7 36 = 2 with a remainder of 18.\n\nNow, replace 36 with 90 and 18 with 36.\n\nDivide 36 by 18: 36 \u00f7 18 = 2 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSo, the GCF is 18.\n\nAgain, this confirms the previous results.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 18.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
