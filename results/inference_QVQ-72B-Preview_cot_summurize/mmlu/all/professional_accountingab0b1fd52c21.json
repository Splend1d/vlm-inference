                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario about a company implementing a new time clock system for their hourly employees. The process involves each employee selecting an identification number and then choosing whether to clock in or clock out. There's also a video camera capturing images of the employees using the system. The question is asking which of the four options is least likely to be affected by this new system.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each option represents and how the new system might impact them.\n\nOption A is about fraudulent reporting of employees' own hours. So, this is about employees trying to cheat the system to make it look like they worked more hours than they actually did, maybe to get paid extra.\n\nOption B mentions errors in employees' overtime computation. This seems to be about mistakes in calculating how much overtime pay employees should receive, perhaps due to incorrect recording of their hours or misapplying the company's overtime policies.\n\nOption C is about inaccurate accounting of employees' hours. This is probably a general issue where the recorded hours don't match the actual hours worked, which could lead to underpayment or overpayment of wages.\n\nOption D refers to recording of other employees' hours. This might involve someone clocking in or out for another employee, perhaps to cover for them if they're running late or couldn't make it to work.\n\nNow, I need to think about how the new time clock system addresses these potential exposures.\n\nThe system requires employees to select an identification number, which likely ensures that each clock-in and clock-out is attributed to the correct employee. This should help prevent one employee from recording another's hours, so option D might be significantly reduced.\n\nThe video camera capturing images of employees using the system adds an additional layer of security and accountability. It can verify that the person clocking in or out is indeed the one who is supposed to be doing so, which could deter fraudulent activities like buddy punching (clocking in for a friend).\n\nGiven that, options A, B, and C could still pose some risks, but I need to determine which one is least likely to be affected by the new system.\n\nLet me consider option A again: fraudulent reporting of employees' own hours. If an employee wants to cheat their own hours, they might try to clock in early or clock out late, claiming more hours than they actually worked. The video camera might catch some of this behavior, but if the employee is careful, they might find ways to manipulate the system without being detected.\n\nOption B is about errors in overtime computation. These errors could be unintentional, due to mistakes in calculating hours worked, or they could be deliberate manipulations. The new system, by accurately recording clock-in and clock-out times, should help reduce calculation errors by providing more precise data.\n\nOption C is inaccurate accounting of employees' hours in general. This could be due to various reasons, such as incorrect entry of hours, system malfunctions, or fraud. The new system should improve the accuracy of hour recordings by using identification numbers and video verification.\n\nComparing these, I need to find which one is expected to change the least with the implementation of the new system.\n\nOption D, recording of other employees' hours, seems to be directly addressed by the identification number system and the video camera, making it harder for someone to clock in or out for another employee.\n\nOption B, errors in overtime computation, should be reduced because the system provides more accurate and detailed time data for calculations.\n\nOption C, inaccurate accounting of employees' hours, should also improve with the more precise tracking and verification provided by the new system.\n\nOption A, fraudulent reporting of employees' own hours, might be more difficult to completely eliminate, especially if the employee is sophisticated in their methods. While the video camera adds a deterrent, it may not catch every instance of fraud, particularly if the employee finds ways to manipulate the system without being seen.\n\nTherefore, I'm thinking that option A is the exposure that the new system is least likely to change significantly.\n\nWait a minute, let me think about this differently. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nPerhaps the new system is primarily designed to prevent unauthorized use and ensure that each employee is accurately accounted for. In that case, options D (recording of other employees' hours) and C (inaccurate accounting of employees' hours) would be directly addressed by the identification numbers and video surveillance.\n\nOption B, errors in overtime computation, might still occur if the system doesn't correctly apply the company's overtime rules, but the new system should provide more accurate raw data for calculations, so any errors would likely be due to flaws in the payroll system rather than incorrect hour recordings.\n\nOption A, fraudulent reporting of employees' own hours, involves intentional deception by the employee. While the video camera can help detect some forms of fraud, it might not catch all instances, especially if the employee is clever in how they manipulate the system.\n\nFor example, an employee could clock in early and stay late in a place where they're not visible to the camera, or find other ways to extend their recorded hours without being detected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the video camera records timestamps that can be compared with the clock-in and clock-out times to verify authenticity, but even then, there might be ways for employees to game the system.\n\nIn contrast, options B and C are more about accuracy in recording and calculating hours, which the new system seems well-suited to handle.\n\nOption D is specifically about preventing one employee from recording another's hours, which the identification number system and video camera are designed to prevent.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems that option A is the one that the new system is least likely to change substantially. Fraudulent reporting of one's own hours can be more challenging to detect and prevent, especially if the employee is determined and resourceful in their efforts to cheat the system.\n\nTherefore, my answer would be option A: fraudulent reporting of employees' own hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
