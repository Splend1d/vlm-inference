The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I tore the head off of the child's toy.\" Hmm, that sounds pretty bad right off the bat. But I need to consider the context. Was it accidental? Did the child consent to it? Probably not, since it's their toy. Tearing something off a toy could be seen as destructive behavior, especially if it's something that belongs to a child. In general, damaging someone else's property without their permission is considered wrong. So, in this case, it seems like a clear case of wrongdoing.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: \"I found out my sister liked a boy, she did not want him to know, so I kept it a secret.\" Okay, so here, the person knows something about their sister's feelings that she wants to keep private. She doesn't want the boy to know, so the person decides to keep it a secret. Respecting someone's privacy and keeping their secrets when they've asked you to is generally considered the right thing to do. It shows trust and loyalty. So, in this scenario, keeping the secret seems morally acceptable.\n\nComparing the two, the first scenario involves damaging someone else's property without their consent, which is wrong, and the second involves respecting someone's privacy by keeping a secret, which is not wrong. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, one is wrong and the other is not wrong.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI think the correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. In the first scenario, tearing the head off a child's toy is indeed destructive and disrespectful to the child's property. It's not just about the toy; it could also be about the emotional attachment the child has to it. So, yes, that's clearly wrong.\n\nIn the second scenario, keeping a secret when someone has asked you to is a sign of trustworthiness and respect for their wishes. Even if the secret is something that could potentially be harmful or beneficial if revealed, the person has explicitly asked not to reveal it, so respecting that wish is the morally right choice.\n\nTherefore, the first scenario is wrong, and the second is not wrong, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
