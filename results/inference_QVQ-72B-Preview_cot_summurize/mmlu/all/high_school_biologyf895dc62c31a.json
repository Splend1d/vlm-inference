                    "text": "Let's see. So, mules are like donkey-horse hybrids, right? They're usually sterile, meaning they can't reproduce. That's because they can't perform successful meiosis. Hmm, meiosis is when cells divide to produce gametes, like sperm and eggs. If they can't do that, it means they can't make offspring.\n\nSo, the question is asking which statement about mules is true based on this information.\n\nOption A says they have a relative evolutionary fitness of zero. Well, evolutionary fitness is basically how well an organism can pass on its genes to the next generation. If mules can't reproduce, then they can't pass on their genes, so their fitness would be zero. That seems to make sense.\n\nOption B says their offspring have less genetic variation than the parents. But since mules can't produce offspring, they don't have any offspring to compare. So, this doesn't seem applicable.\n\nOption C says mutations cannot occur in their genomes. Well, mutations can happen in any organism. Just because an organism can't reproduce doesn't mean its DNA can't mutate. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption D says that if crossing-over happens in mules, then it must be limited to prophase of mitosis. Crossing-over is usually part of meiosis, where chromosomes exchange genetic material. Since mules can't perform successful meiosis, maybe crossing-over doesn't occur, or if it does, it might be abnormal. But I'm not sure about this one.\n\nLet me think again. The question mentions that mules generally can't perform successful meiosis, which leads to their sterility. So, they don't produce offspring. Therefore, their reproductive success is zero, which directly relates to their evolutionary fitness.\n\nSo, option A seems the most straightforward answer based on the information provided.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nEvolutionary fitness is measured by the number of offspring an organism leaves behind that can also reproduce. Since mules don't produce offspring, their fitness is zero. That seems correct.\n\nOption B is about offspring having less genetic variation, but since they don't have offspring, it's not relevant.\n\nOption C is incorrect because mutations can still occur in their DNA, even if they can't pass them on.\n\nOption D is a bit tricky. Crossing-over typically occurs during prophase I of meiosis. If mules can't perform successful meiosis, maybe crossing-over doesn't occur properly. But the statement says \"if crossing-over happens in mules, then it must be limited to prophase of mitosis.\" Mitosis is a different process from meiosis; it's for cell division, not producing gametes. So, crossing-over is specific to meiosis, not mitosis. Therefore, this option doesn't seem correct.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, option A seems to be the true statement about mules based on the given information.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
