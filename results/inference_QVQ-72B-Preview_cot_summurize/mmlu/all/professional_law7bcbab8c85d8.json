                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out who owns the property now. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a college student and her boyfriend who live together in Los Angeles. They bought a piece of land on a hillside overlooking the Pacific. When they bought it, they were engaged to be married, and the deed says they're joint tenants with right of survivorship. That means if one of them dies, the other automatically gets the property without needing a will.\n\nNow, the boyfriend is having financial troubles. He decides to sell the property to his co-worker without telling the student. He forges the student's signature on the deed and delivers it to the co-worker for $150,000, which is the fair market value. The co-worker records the deed right away.\n\nOkay, so the question is, who owns the property now? Let's look at the options:\n\nA. The boyfriend and the student as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\n\nB. The co-worker and the student as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\n\nC. The co-worker and the student as tenants in common.\n\nD. The co-worker as owner in fee simple.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what happens when someone forges a signature on a deed. If the boyfriend forged the student's signature, does that make the deed invalid? Generally, forgery can make a deed invalid because it's not a genuine expression of the owner's intent to transfer the property.\n\nBut, the co-worker paid fair market value and recorded the deed immediately. In many jurisdictions, a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of any defects in the title can acquire good title to the property. However, forgery might be considered a defect that cannot be overcome by being a bona fide purchaser.\n\nWait, but in some places, if the forgery is discovered and the original owners take action within a certain time frame, they can challenge the transfer. But since the co-worker recorded the deed, that might give him some protection under the recording statutes.\n\nLet me think about the type of ownership. Initially, it was a joint tenancy with right of survivorship. In joint tenancy, each owner has an undivided interest in the whole property, and upon one owner's death, their interest passes to the surviving owner(s).\n\nBut in this case, one of the joint tenants is trying to sell the property without the other's consent. Generally, in joint tenancy, both owners must agree to sell the property. If one owner sells their interest without the other's consent, it typically converts the joint tenancy into a tenancy in common for that portion sold.\n\nSo, if the boyfriend sells his interest in the joint tenancy to the co-worker, and forges the student's signature to make it look like both are selling, what happens?\n\nWell, the forgery means that the student didn't actually agree to sell her interest. So, the boyfriend only had the right to sell his own interest, not the student's.\n\nBut the boyfriend presented a deed that appears to transfer both interests, which is fraudulent.\n\nNow, the co-worker paid fair market value and recorded the deed. If the co-worker didn't know about the forgery and acted in good faith, they might be protected as a bona fide purchaser.\n\nHowever, forgery is a serious issue, and it might override the protection for a bona fide purchaser.\n\nBut, in practice, if the co-worker didn't know about the forgery and paid fair value, they might still get some protection.\n\nLet me consider the nature of joint tenancy. In joint tenancy, each tenant has an undivided interest in the whole property. So, if the boyfriend sells his interest, the co-worker would acquire that interest, but the student would still have her interest.\n\nBut in this case, the boyfriend forged the student's signature, making it seem like both are selling. So, the co-worker likely believes he's buying the entire property.\n\nIf the co-worker is innocent and didn't know about the forgery, he might have acquired the boyfriend's interest in the property.\n\nBut since the student's signature was forged, her consent was not genuine, and her interest wasn't transferred.\n\nSo, the co-worker would have the boyfriend's interest, and the student would still have her interest.\n\nThat would mean they hold the property as tenants in common, each owning a share.\n\nBut the original deed specified joint tenancy with right of survivorship.\n\nWait, in some jurisdictions, if one joint tenant sells their interest, the surviving joint tenant can still claim the entire property upon the other's death because of the right of survivorship.\n\nBut in this case, since the boyfriend sold his interest, and the student didn't consent, it likely severs the joint tenancy as to the boyfriend's interest.\n\nSo, the co-worker would own the boyfriend's interest, and the student would own her interest, making them tenants in common.\n\nBut the question says that the common law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute, so maybe there are no statutory modifications that would change this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire transfer is invalid due to the forgery, and the property remains with the student and the boyfriend as joint tenants.\n\nBut that seems unlikely because the co-worker paid fair value and recorded the deed, which typically provides some protection.\n\nWait, maybe the co-worker gets the boyfriend's interest, and the student retains her interest, making them tenants in common.\n\nBut option C says the co-worker and the student as tenants in common.\n\nOption D says the co-worker as owner in fee simple, meaning he owns the entire property outright.\n\nGiven that the boyfriend only had the right to sell his interest, not the entire property, I don't think the co-worker can acquire the entire property through this fraudulent transfer.\n\nSo, option D seems unlikely.\n\nOption B suggests the co-worker and the student as joint tenants with right of survivorship, but that would require both agreeing to form a joint tenancy, which didn't happen here.\n\nOption A says the boyfriend and the student remain as joint tenants, but the boyfriend has transferred his interest, so that's probably not accurate.\n\nOption C seems the most plausible: the co-worker and the student as tenants in common.\n\nBut let's think deeper.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, if one joint tenant sells their interest, the buyer becomes a tenant in common with the remaining joint tenant.\n\nSo, in this case, the co-worker would own the boyfriend's share, and the student would own her share, making them tenants in common.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend forged the student's signature, which might complicate things.\n\nIf the co-worker believed in good faith that both were selling, and paid fair value, perhaps he gets the boyfriend's interest, and the student retains her interest.\n\nSo, yes, they would be tenants in common.\n\nBut what if the student claims that the entire transaction is invalid due to forgery?\n\nWell, forgery affects the student's signature, but the boyfriend did have the right to sell his own interest.\n\nSo, the co-worker gets the boyfriend's interest, and the student retains her interest, making them tenants in common.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: the co-worker and the student as tenants in common.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
