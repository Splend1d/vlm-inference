                    "text": "So I have this question here about ferromagnetic materials and how their magnetisation relates to the applied magnetic field. The options are:\n\nA. sinusoidally.\n\nB. non-linearly.\n\nC. linearly.\n\nD. parabolically.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me recall what I know about ferromagnetism.\n\nFirst off, ferromagnetic materials are substances like iron, cobalt, and nickel that can be strongly magnetised. They have the property of retaining magnetisation even after an external magnetic field is removed, which is different from paramagnetic or diamagnetic materials.\n\nNow, the relationship between magnetisation (M) and the applied magnetic field (H) in ferromagnetic materials isn't straightforward. I remember learning about hysteresis loops in this context. A hysteresis loop shows how the magnetisation of a material changes with varying applied magnetic field, and it typically has a loop shape, meaning that the path followed during magnetisation and demagnetisation is different. That already suggests that the relationship isn't linear.\n\nLet me think about linear relationships first. If the relationship were linear, then increasing the applied field by a certain amount would always result in a proportional increase in magnetisation. But in ferromagnetic materials, especially at high fields, this isn't the case. They tend to saturate; that is, after a certain point, further increases in the field don't lead to significant increases in magnetisation.\n\nSo, option C, linearly, seems unlikely.\n\nOption A is sinusoidally. Sinusoidal relationships are like waves, following a sine or cosine function. While some physical phenomena exhibit sinusoidal behavior, like alternating currents or simple harmonic motion, I don't recall magnetisation in ferromagnetic materials following a sinusoidal pattern. The hysteresis loop is more rectangular or butterfly-shaped, not sinusoidal. So, option A probably isn't correct.\n\nOption D is parabolically. A parabolic relationship would mean that the magnetisation is proportional to the square of the applied field. While in some materials, especially at low fields, the magnetisation might increase roughly quadratically with the field, this isn't generally the case for ferromagnetic materials. Moreover, the hysteresis behavior suggests a more complex relationship than a simple parabola.\n\nThat leaves option B, non-linearly. This seems to align best with what I know. The relationship between magnetisation and applied field in ferromagnetic materials is indeed non-linear. The hysteresis loop is a clear indication of this non-linearity, as it shows that the magnetisation doesn't change proportionally with the applied field, and there's a lag in the response when the field is decreased or reversed.\n\nTo double-check, I can recall the basic equation relating magnetisation and magnetic field in ferromagnetic materials. The magnetic induction B is related to the applied field H and the magnetisation M by:\n\nB = \u03bc\u2080(H + M)\n\nWhere \u03bc\u2080 is the permeability of free space. In linear materials, M is proportional to H, and B is proportional to H, resulting in a constant permeability. However, in ferromagnetic materials, M is not proportional to H, especially at higher fields, which leads to a non-constant permeability and thus a non-linear relationship.\n\nAdditionally, the phenomenon of magnetic domains plays a role in ferromagnetism. These domains can align with an applied field up to a point, after which saturation occurs, further confirming the non-linear behavior.\n\nI should also consider the initial magnetisation curve, which shows how M increases with H when starting from a demagnetised state. This curve is typically S-shaped, or sigmoidal, which is definitely non-linear.\n\nMoreover, the cyclic behavior of magnetisation with respect to the applied field, as seen in the hysteresis loop, further emphasizes the non-linear nature of the relationship.\n\nTherefore, based on all these considerations, option B, non-linearly, is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
