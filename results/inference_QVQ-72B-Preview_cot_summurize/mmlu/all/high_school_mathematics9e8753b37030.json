                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"How many arithmetic sequences of consecutive odd integers sum to 240?\" Hmm, interesting. I need to find sequences of odd numbers that add up to 240, and figure out how many such sequences exist. The options are 8, 12, 10, or 4. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an arithmetic sequence of consecutive odd integers looks like. Odd integers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. They increase by 2 each time. So, in an arithmetic sequence of consecutive odd integers, the common difference is 2.\n\nThe problem is asking for the number of such sequences that sum to 240. I need to find all possible sequences of odd numbers where the sum of the sequence equals 240, and each term in the sequence is an odd integer, and they are consecutive.\n\nMaybe I can start by considering the general formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence. The sum S of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a_1 + a_n) \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of terms\n\n- \\( a_1 \\) is the first term\n\n- \\( a_n \\) is the last term\n\nBut since the terms are consecutive odd integers with a common difference of 2, maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, since the common difference is 2, I can express the sequence in terms of its first term and the number of terms. Let's denote the first term as \\( a \\), which is an odd integer, and the number of terms as \\( n \\). Then, the sequence is:\n\n\\[ a, a+2, a+4, \\dots, a + 2(n-1) \\]\n\nThe sum of this arithmetic sequence is:\n\n\\[ S = n \\times \\left( \\frac{a + a + 2(n-1)}{2} \\right) = n \\times \\left( a + n - 1 \\right) \\]\n\nWait, actually, since the common difference is 2, the sum can be simplified. The average of the first and last term is \\( a + n - 1 \\), and there are \\( n \\) terms, so:\n\n\\[ S = n \\times (a + n - 1) \\]\n\nBut I need \\( S = 240 \\), so:\n\n\\[ n(a + n - 1) = 240 \\]\n\nAlso, since the terms are odd integers, \\( a \\) must be odd.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nLet me think differently. Since all the terms are odd, their sum must be even or odd depending on the number of terms. Specifically, the sum of an even number of odd integers is even, and the sum of an odd number of odd integers is odd. But 240 is even, so only sequences with an even number of terms will sum to an even number.\n\nWait, is that right? Let's check:\n\n- Sum of two odd integers: odd + odd = even\n\n- Sum of three odd integers: odd + odd + odd = odd\n\n- Sum of four odd integers: even\n\n- And so on...\n\nSo, the sum is even only when the number of terms is even. Therefore, only sequences with an even number of terms can sum to 240, since 240 is even.\n\nBut hold on, is that always true? Let me see. Take for example, the sequence with just one term: 240 is even, but 240 is not an odd integer. So, sequences with one term are out, because 240 isn't odd. But according to my earlier reasoning, sequences with an odd number of terms would have odd sums, which is not the case here since 240 is even. So, sequences with an even number of terms are possible.\n\nWait, but let's consider a sequence with two terms: if both terms are odd, their sum is even. So, sequences with two terms could work if their sum is 240. Similarly, sequences with four terms, six terms, and so on.\n\nBut what about sequences with three terms? Their sum would be odd, which doesn't match 240, which is even. So, sequences with three terms are not possible. Similarly, sequences with five terms would have odd sums, so they're out. And sequences with one term are also out because 240 isn't odd.\n\nTherefore, only sequences with an even number of terms are possible.\n\nSo, I need to find sequences with 2, 4, 6, 8, etc., terms, where the sum is 240, and each term is an odd integer.\n\nLet me try to find a general expression for such sequences.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of terms as \\( n \\), and the first term as \\( a \\), where \\( a \\) is an odd integer.\n\nThe sequence is:\n\n\\[ a, a+2, a+4, \\dots, a + 2(n-1) \\]\n\nThe sum of this sequence is:\n\n\\[ S = n \\times a + 2 \\times \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = n \\times a + n(n-1) \\]\n\nWait, that's not quite right. Let me correct that.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a_1 + a_n) \\]\n\nIn this case, \\( a_n = a + 2(n-1) \\), so:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + a + 2(n-1)) = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (2a + 2(n-1)) = \\frac{n}{2} \\times 2(a + n - 1) = n(a + n - 1) \\]\n\nSo, \\( S = n(a + n - 1) = 240 \\)\n\nSince \\( a \\) is an odd integer, and \\( n \\) is the number of terms, which must be even (as we established earlier).\n\nSo, \\( n \\) must be even, and \\( a \\) must be odd.\n\nLet me set \\( n = 2k \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive integer.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 2k(a + 2k - 1) = 240 \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ k(a + 2k - 1) = 120 \\]\n\nNow, \\( a \\) is an odd integer, and \\( k \\) is a positive integer.\n\nI need to find all pairs \\( (k, a) \\) that satisfy this equation, with \\( a \\) being odd and \\( k \\) being a positive integer.\n\nLet me solve for \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{120}{k} - 2k + 1 \\]\n\nSince \\( a \\) must be odd, \\( \\frac{120}{k} - 2k + 1 \\) must be an odd integer.\n\nAlso, \\( n = 2k \\), and \\( n \\) must be even, which it is, and \\( k \\) is positive.\n\nSo, I need to find all positive integer values of \\( k \\) such that \\( \\frac{120}{k} \\) is an integer, since \\( k \\) must divide 120, and \\( a \\) is an integer.\n\nWait, but \\( \\frac{120}{k} \\) must be an integer because \\( a \\) is an integer.\n\nWait, is that necessarily true? Let me check.\n\nFrom \\( a = \\frac{120}{k} - 2k + 1 \\), for \\( a \\) to be an integer, \\( \\frac{120}{k} \\) must be an integer, because \\( -2k + 1 \\) is already an integer.\n\nSo, \\( k \\) must be a divisor of 120.\n\nAlso, since \\( n = 2k \\) and \\( n \\) must be even, \\( k \\) can be any positive integer divisor of 120.\n\nBut wait, \\( n \\) must be even, which it is since \\( n = 2k \\), and \\( k \\) is positive integer.\n\nSo, I need to find all positive integer divisors \\( k \\) of 120, and then check if \\( a \\) is odd.\n\nWait, but \\( a \\) must be odd, so from \\( a = \\frac{120}{k} - 2k + 1 \\), I need to ensure that \\( a \\) is odd.\n\nBut since \\( a \\) is defined as an odd integer, and \\( k \\) is a divisor of 120, I need to ensure that for each \\( k \\), \\( a \\) is indeed odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider the average of the sequence. In an arithmetic sequence with common difference 2, the average is the median, which is the middle term.\n\nIf \\( n \\) is even, the median is the average of the two middle terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think about the average value of the sequence.\n\nThe sum is 240, and the number of terms is \\( n \\), so the average value is \\( \\frac{240}{n} \\).\n\nSince the sequence consists of consecutive odd integers, the average must also be an odd integer.\n\nWait, is that true?\n\nActually, no. The average of consecutive odd integers is the middle term, which is itself an odd integer only if \\( n \\) is odd, but earlier we saw that \\( n \\) must be even for the sum to be even.\n\nWait, but 240 is even, so for the sum to be even, \\( n \\) must be even, as established.\n\nBut if \\( n \\) is even, the average of the sequence is the average of the two middle terms.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the sequence as:\n\n\\[ a, a+2, a+4, \\dots, a + 2(n-1) \\]\n\nThe middle terms are \\( a + (n/2 - 1) \\times 2 \\) and \\( a + (n/2) \\times 2 \\).\n\nTheir average is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{a + 2(n/2 - 1) + a + 2(n/2)}{2} = \\frac{2a + 2n - 2}{2} = a + n - 1 \\]\n\nSo, the average of the sequence is \\( a + n - 1 \\), and this must equal \\( \\frac{240}{n} \\).\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ a + n - 1 = \\frac{240}{n} \\]\n\nBut earlier, we had \\( a = \\frac{120}{k} - 2k + 1 \\), where \\( k = \\frac{n}{2} \\).\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nLet me correct that.\n\nFrom \\( S = n(a + n - 1) = 240 \\), and \\( n = 2k \\), then:\n\n\\[ 2k(a + 2k - 1) = 240 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ a + 2k - 1 = \\frac{240}{2k} = \\frac{120}{k} \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{120}{k} - 2k + 1 \\]\n\nNow, since \\( a \\) must be an odd integer, \\( \\frac{120}{k} - 2k + 1 \\) must be an odd integer.\n\nAlso, \\( k \\) must be a positive integer divisor of 120, because \\( \\frac{120}{k} \\) must be an integer.\n\nSo, first, find all positive integer divisors \\( k \\) of 120, then check if \\( a = \\frac{120}{k} - 2k + 1 \\) is an odd integer.\n\nLet me list the positive divisors of 120.\n\n120 can be factored as \\( 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\), so its positive divisors are:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.\n\nNow, for each \\( k \\) in this list, compute \\( a = \\frac{120}{k} - 2k + 1 \\), and check if \\( a \\) is an odd integer.\n\nLet's do that.\n\nStarting with \\( k = 1 \\):\n\n\\( a = \\frac{120}{1} - 2(1) + 1 = 120 - 2 + 1 = 119 \\), which is odd.\n\nSo, \\( a = 119 \\), \\( n = 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\), sequence: 119, 121. Sum: 119 + 121 = 240. Good.\n\nNext, \\( k = 2 \\):\n\n\\( a = \\frac{120}{2} - 2(2) + 1 = 60 - 4 + 1 = 57 \\), which is odd.\n\nSequence: 57, 59, 61, 63. Wait, but \\( n = 4 \\), so four terms: 57, 59, 61, 63. Sum: 57 + 59 + 61 + 63 = 240. Correct.\n\nNext, \\( k = 3 \\):\n\n\\( a = \\frac{120}{3} - 2(3) + 1 = 40 - 6 + 1 = 35 \\), which is odd.\n\nSequence: 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45. Wait, \\( n = 6 \\), so six terms: 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45. Sum: 35 + 37 + 39 + 41 + 43 + 45 = 240. Correct.\n\nNext, \\( k = 4 \\):\n\n\\( a = \\frac{120}{4} - 2(4) + 1 = 30 - 8 + 1 = 23 \\), which is odd.\n\nSequence: 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37. Wait, \\( n = 8 \\), so eight terms: 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37. Sum: 23 + 25 + 27 + 29 + 31 + 33 + 35 + 37 = 240. Correct.\n\nNext, \\( k = 5 \\):\n\n\\( a = \\frac{120}{5} - 2(5) + 1 = 24 - 10 + 1 = 15 \\), which is odd.\n\nSequence: 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33. Wait, \\( n = 10 \\), so ten terms: 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33. Sum: 15 + 17 + 19 + 21 + 23 + 25 + 27 + 29 + 31 + 33 = 240. Correct.\n\nNext, \\( k = 6 \\):\n\n\\( a = \\frac{120}{6} - 2(6) + 1 = 20 - 12 + 1 = 9 \\), which is odd.\n\nSequence: 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31. Wait, \\( n = 12 \\), so twelve terms: 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31. Sum: 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 + 21 + 23 + 25 + 27 + 29 + 31 = 240. Correct.\n\nNext, \\( k = 8 \\):\n\n\\( a = \\frac{120}{8} - 2(8) + 1 = 15 - 16 + 1 = 0 \\), which is even, not odd.\n\nSo, \\( a = 0 \\), which is even, but the problem specifies consecutive odd integers, and 0 is even, so this doesn't work.\n\nWait, but 0 is even, and the problem specifies odd integers. So, this sequence would include 0, which is even, so it's invalid.\n\nTherefore, \\( k = 8 \\) is not acceptable.\n\nNext, \\( k = 10 \\):\n\n\\( a = \\frac{120}{10} - 2(10) + 1 = 12 - 20 + 1 = -7 \\), which is odd.\n\nSequence: -7, -5, -3, -1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31. Wait, \\( n = 20 \\), so twenty terms: -7, -5, -3, -1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 29, 31. Sum: -7 + (-5) + (-3) + (-1) + 1 + 3 + 5"
