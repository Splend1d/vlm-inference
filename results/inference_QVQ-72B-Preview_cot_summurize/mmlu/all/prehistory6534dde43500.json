                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question about the Minoans and what they did in times of great difficulty and stress to appease their gods. The options are:\n\nA. Sacrificed adults and occasionally children\n\nB. Burnt their own houses to the ground\n\nC. Fasted for long periods\n\nD. Abstained from sexual relations\n\nHmm, the Minoans were an ancient civilization that flourished on the island of Crete and other parts of the Aegean Sea from about 3000 to 1100 BCE. They had a rich culture with their own unique practices and beliefs.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what I know about Minoan religion and their practices, especially in times of crisis or stress. I remember that their religion was polytheistic, featuring many gods and goddesses, and that they had elaborate rituals and ceremonies.\n\nOption A suggests human sacrifice, including adults and children. I know that human sacrifice was practiced in various ancient cultures, but was it part of Minoan religion?\n\nLet me think about this. In ancient Greek mythology, which was influenced by Minoan culture, there are references to human sacrifice, like the story of Theseus and the Minotaur, where Athenians had to sacrifice youths to the monster. But that's more of a mythological account, not necessarily historical practice.\n\nActual archaeological evidence from Minoan sites doesn't provide clear-cut proof of human sacrifice. While there are depictions of sacrificial rituals, they often involve animals, not humans. So, it seems unlikely that the Minoans practiced human sacrifice, especially of children, as a regular part of their religious practices.\n\nOption B is about burning their own houses to the ground. This seems extreme and doesn't align with what we know about Minoan practices. Destroying one's own property to appease the gods doesn't make much sense from a practical standpoint, and there's no evidence to suggest that this was a common practice among the Minoans.\n\nOption C is fasting for long periods. Fasting is a common practice in many religions as a form of purification or penance. It involves abstaining from food or certain types of food for a set period. In Minoan art and literature, there are references to fasting and dietary restrictions during religious festivals and ceremonies.\n\nFor example, before participating in certain rituals, Minoans might have fasted to show respect and purity. So, this seems like a plausible practice they might have engaged in during times of stress to appease their gods.\n\nOption D is abstaining from sexual relations. Sexuality was an important aspect of Minoan culture, and they had a more open attitude towards sexuality compared to some other ancient cultures. However, there is evidence to suggest that during certain religious observances or periods of mourning, sexual activity might have been restricted.\n\nFor instance, priests and priestesses might have taken vows of celibacy during specific periods to maintain their spiritual purity. So, this could also be a possible practice in times of difficulty and stress.\n\nBetween options C and D, which one is more likely? Well, fasting is a widespread practice in many religions and cultures, and it's often associated with times of crisis or seeking divine favor. Abstaining from sexual relations is also common in religious observances, but perhaps not as universally practiced as fasting.\n\nMoreover, in Minoan culture, which was known for its emphasis on physical health and athleticism, fasting might have been seen as a more significant act of devotion and self-discipline. Additionally, there is more explicit evidence for fasting in Minoan rituals than for sexual abstention outside of specific religious roles.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it seems most likely that the Minoans fasted for long periods in times of great difficulty and stress to appease their gods.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
