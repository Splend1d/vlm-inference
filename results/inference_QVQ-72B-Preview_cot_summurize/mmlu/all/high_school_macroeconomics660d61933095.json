                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this economics problem. It says that if $100 of new autonomous private investment is added to an economy with a marginal propensity to consume of 0.90, by how much would aggregate demand shift to the right? The options are A. $190, B. $900, C. $1,000, and D. $1,900.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what's going on here. Autonomous private investment is just investment that happens regardless of the interest rate or the state of the economy, right? So, adding $100 of this kind of investment means that there's an initial increase in spending by $100.\n\nNow, the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.90. That means that for every additional dollar people earn, they spend 90 cents and save 10 cents. This concept is important because it relates to the multiplier effect in the economy.\n\nThe multiplier effect is when an initial increase in spending leads to a larger total increase in aggregate demand because the initial spending generates income for others, who then spend a portion of that income, and so on, in a chain reaction.\n\nSo, the formula to calculate the multiplier is 1 divided by (1 - MPC). In this case, MPC is 0.90, so the multiplier should be 1 / (1 - 0.90) = 1 / 0.10 = 10. That means any initial change in spending will be multiplied by 10 times in the aggregate demand.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. The formula for the multiplier is indeed 1 / (1 - MPC), so with MPC of 0.90, the multiplier should be 10. So, if there's an initial increase in investment of $100, the total increase in aggregate demand should be $100 multiplied by 10, which is $1,000.\n\nBut looking at the options, B is $900, C is $1,000, and D is $1,900. So, $1,000 seems like the straightforward answer, but maybe there's more to it.\n\nLet me think about the components of aggregate demand. Aggregate demand is the total demand for goods and services in an economy, and it's represented by the sum of consumption (C), investment (I), government spending (G), and net exports (NX). So, AD = C + I + G + NX.\n\nIf there's an increase in investment of $100, that directly increases aggregate demand by $100. But then, because of the multiplier effect, this initial increase leads to further increases in consumption as people earn more income from the initial investment.\n\nSo, the initial increase is $100, and with an MPC of 0.90, each subsequent round of spending is 90% of the previous round.\n\nLet me try to calculate this step by step.\n\nInitial investment: +$100\n\nFirst round: the $100 is spent on investment goods, which increases production and incomes of workers and companies.\n\nSecond round: the workers and companies spend 90% of the $100, which is $90, on consumption.\n\nThird round: the recipients of the $90 spend 90% of that, which is $81, on consumption.\n\nAnd this continues indefinitely, with each round seeing 90% of the previous round's spending.\n\nSo, the total increase in aggregate demand should be the sum of this geometric series:\n\n$100 + $90 + $81 + ... = $100 * (1 / (1 - 0.90)) = $100 * 10 = $1,000.\n\nHmm, that matches option C, $1,000.\n\nBut let me see if there's any other factor I should consider. Maybe the marginal propensity to import or something like that, but the problem doesn't mention any other factors. It just says private investment and MPC.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the marginal propensity to save as well. If MPC is 0.90, then MPS (marginal propensity to save) is 0.10. But in the standard Keynesian cross model, the multiplier is indeed 1 / (1 - MPC), which is 10 in this case.\n\nSo, $100 * 10 = $1,000 seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other way to interpret this. Maybe using the investment multiplier formula. In some textbooks, the investment multiplier is calculated as 1 / MPS, which is also 1 / 0.10 = 10.\n\nSo, again, that points to the multiplier being 10, and the total increase in aggregate demand being $1,000.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the multiplier effect in terms of changes:\n\n\u0394AD = Initial change in spending * Multiplier\n\n\u0394AD = $100 * 10 = $1,000.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nBut let me think about leakages and injections in the circular flow of income. Investment is an injection into the circular flow, and saving is a leakage. The multiplier captures how the injection leads to increased income, which leads to increased consumption, and so on.\n\nSo, again, with MPC of 0.90, the multiplier should be 10, leading to a total increase of $1,000 in aggregate demand.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the tax rate or something, but the problem doesn't mention any taxes. It only mentions MPC and autonomous investment.\n\nAssuming no taxes or other leakages beyond saving, the multiplier should indeed be 1 / (1 - MPC) = 10.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. $1,000.\n\nBut let's see why the other options might be wrong.\n\nOption A is $190. That seems too low. It's less than the initial investment of $100, which doesn't make sense in this context because the multiplier effect should amplify the initial change.\n\nOption B is $900. That might be a mistake, perhaps confusing it with the first round of spending after the initial investment. As we calculated, the initial $100 leads to $90 in additional spending in the first round, but that would only account for two rounds, not the entire multiplier effect.\n\nOption D is $1,900. That seems too high. If the multiplier is 10 and the initial change is $100, the total should be $1,000, not $1,900.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. $1,000.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and $1,000 seems to be the right answer based on the multiplier effect with the given MPC.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
