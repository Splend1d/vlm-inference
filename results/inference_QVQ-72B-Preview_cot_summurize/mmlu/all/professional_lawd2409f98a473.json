                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a sex discrimination lawsuit where a plaintiff is trying to testify about something a janitor overheard her supervisor say. The question is whether this testimony is admissible in court. Let me try to wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst off, I need to remember what hearsay is. Hearsay is when someone reports what another person said, and it's generally not admissible unless there's an exception that allows it. So, in this case, the plaintiff wants to testify about what the janitor told her, and what the supervisor supposedly said. That sounds like hearsay because it's secondhand information.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. The janitor heard the supervisor make a comment.\n\n2. The janitor then told the plaintiff about what he heard.\n\nSo, if the plaintiff testifies about what the janitor told her, that's one layer of hearsay (the janitor's statement to her). Then, within that, there's another layer: the supervisor's statement that the janitor overheard. That's like double hearsay.\n\nOption A says no, because the janitor's statement is hearsay not within any exception. Option B says no, because both the janitor's and the supervisor's statements are hearsay not within any exception. So, both options are saying the testimony is not admissible, but for slightly different reasons.\n\nOption C says yes, because the janitor's statement is a present sense impression, and the supervisor's statement is a statement of his then-existing state of mind. Option D says yes, because both statements are concerning a matter within the scope of their employment.\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate whether these statements can be admitted under any exceptions to the hearsay rule.\n\nLet's consider the janitor's statement first. The janitor is supposedly telling the plaintiff about what he overheard shortly after he heard it. Does that sound like a present sense impression?\n\nA present sense impression is a statement describing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the event or condition, or immediately thereafter. So, if the janitor heard the supervisor make the comment and then immediately told the plaintiff about it, that could qualify as a present sense impression.\n\nBut, I need to think about whether the time between the supervisor's comment and the janitor telling the plaintiff was immediate enough. It doesn't specify how soon after the janitor told the plaintiff, so maybe that's a bit unclear.\n\nNow, the supervisor's statement: \"Make it hard for her. Maybe she'll go home where she belongs.\" This seems like a statement of the supervisor's then-existing state of mind, which is relevant to the discrimination claim. In federal rules, statements of the declarant's then-existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition are admissible to show the declarant's condition at that time.\n\nBut, wait a minute, is the supervisor's statement being offered to prove that the supervisor actually had that state of mind, or is it being offered to show that the janitor heard it, which might be relevant to the plaintiff's claim of discrimination?\n\nHmm.\n\nAlso, in discrimination cases, statements by supervisors can be admissible to show discriminatory intent or bias, especially if they're made in the course of their employment and relate to the decision to terminate the plaintiff.\n\nOption D suggests that both statements are concerning a matter within the scope of their employment. For the janitor, maybe, but for the supervisor, yes, because it relates to the plaintiff's employment.\n\nBut, I'm not sure if that's a specific hearsay exception. There is an exception for statements by an agent or employee on a matter within the scope of their employment, but that's for the declarant's own statements, not for someone else reporting them.\n\nSo, for the janitor's statement, if it's a present sense impression, it might be admissible. For the supervisor's statement, if it's being offered to show his state of mind or bias, it might be admissible under the state of mind exception.\n\nBut, since the plaintiff is testifying about what the janitor told her, and the janitor is not testifying himself, it's still hearsay within hearsay.\n\nWait, maybe the plaintiff is testifying about what the janitor told her, and the janitor's statement is being offered to prove what the supervisor said. So, it's the plaintiff's testimony that includes the janitor's statement, which includes the supervisor's statement.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nIn employment discrimination cases, sometimes statements by supervisors can be attributed to the employer if they're made in the course of employment and show discriminatory animus. So, if the supervisor made this statement to other male coworkers, and the janitor overheard it, and then told the plaintiff, the statement might be admissible to show the supervisor's bias, which could be imputed to the employer.\n\nBut, again, it's hearsay, so it needs an exception.\n\nMaybe the supervisor's statement can be admitted as a statement by an agent or employee on a matter within the scope of employment. And the janitor's statement could be admitted as a present sense impression.\n\nBut, I'm not entirely sure if that covers both layers of hearsay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the janitor's statement is being offered to show that the supervisor made the statement, and the supervisor's statement is being offered to show his discriminatory intent.\n\nIn that case, maybe both layers can be admitted under different exceptions.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If the janitor were to testify about what he heard the supervisor say, that would be one layer of hearsay: the supervisor's statement. If the janitor is unavailable, then that would still be hearsay unless there's an exception.\n\nBut in this scenario, it's the plaintiff testifying about what the janitor told her, so it's the janitor's statement to her that's being offered, which includes the supervisor's statement.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe the plaintiff's testimony is being offered to show the supervisor's statement, and the janitor's statement is just the means to get there.\n\nBut, generally, hearsay within hearsay requires that each layer be supported by an exception.\n\nSo, if the janitor's statement to the plaintiff is being offered to prove what the supervisor said, then the janitor's statement is hearsay unless it falls under an exception, and the supervisor's statement is also hearsay unless it falls under an exception.\n\nOption A says no, because the janitor's statement is hearsay not within any exception. But, as I thought earlier, if the janitor's statement is a present sense impression, it might be admissible.\n\nOption B says no, because both the janitor's and the supervisor's statements are hearsay not within any exception. But again, if both can be covered by exceptions, then the testimony might be admissible.\n\nOption C says yes, because the janitor's statement is a present sense impression, and the supervisor's statement is a statement of his then-existing state of mind. That seems plausible.\n\nOption D says yes, because both statements are concerning a matter within the scope of their employment. For the supervisor, maybe, but for the janitor, I'm not so sure.\n\nI think the key here is whether the janitor's statement can be admitted as a present sense impression, and the supervisor's statement can be admitted as a statement of then-existing state of mind.\n\nAdditionally, in employment discrimination cases, statements by supervisors can be admissible to show discriminatory animus, especially if they relate to the decision to terminate the plaintiff.\n\nSo, perhaps the plaintiff's testimony is admissible under these exceptions.\n\nBut, I'm still a bit unsure about the double hearsay issue. Does the fact that it's being offered in a discrimination case allow for some leeway?\n\nI need to recall if there are any specific rules or exceptions that apply to employment discrimination cases regarding hearsay.\n\nI think that in such cases, statements by supervisors can be admitted to show bias or discriminatory intent, even if they're hearsay, because they're relevant to the employer's state of mind.\n\nBut, again, I'm not entirely sure.\n\nMaybe I should look up the Federal Rules of Evidence regarding hearsay exceptions and employment discrimination.\n\nBut since I can't do that right now, I'll have to rely on my memory.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose the janitor is testifying about what he heard the supervisor say. That would be the supervisor's statement, which is hearsay unless it falls under an exception.\n\nIf the supervisor's statement is being offered to prove his state of mind or bias, it might be admissible under the state of mind exception.\n\nThen, if the janitor is testifying about it, and he's available, that might be acceptable.\n\nBut in this scenario, it's the plaintiff testifying about what the janitor told her.\n\nSo, it's the plaintiff's testimony that includes the janitor's statement, which includes the supervisor's statement.\n\nThis seems like a case where both layers need exceptions.\n\nIf the janitor's statement is a present sense impression, that might cover his statement to the plaintiff.\n\nThen, the supervisor's statement could be covered by the state of mind exception.\n\nSo, perhaps the plaintiff's testimony is admissible under these exceptions.\n\nTherefore, options C and D suggest it's admissible, while A and B say it's not.\n\nBetween C and D, option C specifies the exceptions: present sense impression for the janitor's statement and statement of then-existing state of mind for the supervisor's statement.\n\nOption D refers to statements concerning a matter within the scope of employment, which might apply to the supervisor's statement but not necessarily to the janitor's statement.\n\nSo, option C seems more accurate because it specifies the exceptions that would allow both layers of hearsay to be admitted.\n\nOption D doesn't seem to cover the janitor's statement adequately.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C: yes, because the janitor's statement is a present sense impression, and the supervisor's statement is a statement of his then-existing state of mind.\n\nBut, I have to admit, I'm still a bit unsure about whether the present sense impression exception would cover the janitor's statement to the plaintiff, especially without knowing how soon after the event the janitor told the plaintiff.\n\nMaybe it's a close call, but based on the options provided, C seems the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
