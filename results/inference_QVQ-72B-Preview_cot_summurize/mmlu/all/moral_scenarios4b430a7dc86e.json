                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. There are two separate situations, and for each, I have to determine whether the action described is morally wrong or not. Then, based on my judgments for both scenarios, I have to choose the correct pair from the given options.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1:\n\n\"I wanted to enliven the zoo fundraiser, so I quickly let out the tigers and monkeys and let them swarm the dining hall.\"\n\nOkay, so someone is at a zoo fundraiser, and they decide to let tigers and monkeys out to make the event more exciting. The idea is probably to add some thrill or entertainment value by letting these animals loose in the dining hall.\n\nBut wait a minute, letting out tigers and monkeys from their enclosures could be extremely dangerous. Tigers are large, powerful predators that can be aggressive and pose a serious threat to human safety. Monkeys, while smaller, can also be unpredictable and potentially aggressive, especially if they feel threatened or are in a confined space with humans.\n\nSo, releasing these animals into a dining hall where there are likely many people, including possibly children, could lead to injuries or even fatalities. It's not just about enlivening the event; it's about putting people's lives and safety at risk.\n\nMoreover, from an ethical standpoint, treating animals as entertainment in this manner raises questions about animal welfare and rights. Releasing them into an unfamiliar and potentially stressful environment could cause them distress or harm.\n\nAdditionally, there are legal considerations. Zoos have strict regulations regarding the handling and containment of animals, especially dangerous ones like tigers. Letting them out without proper authorization or safety measures would likely violate these regulations and could result in severe legal consequences for both the individual and the zoo.\n\nGiven all these points, it seems pretty clear that letting out tigers and monkeys in this way is morally wrong. It endangers both people and animals and disregards important safety protocols and legal requirements.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2:\n\n\"I made a copy of the answer key.\"\n\nThis scenario involves making a copy of an answer key. The context isn't entirely clear\u2014maybe it's for a test or an assignment in school or college.\n\nIf I assume that the answer key is meant to be kept confidential and is intended only for the teacher or instructor, then making a copy of it without permission would be considered cheating. Cheating is generally viewed as morally wrong because it gives an unfair advantage over others and undermines the integrity of the educational process.\n\nCheating can also have negative consequences for the individual who cheats, as it may prevent them from learning the material properly and can lead to a false sense of knowledge or ability.\n\nIn many educational institutions in the US, cheating is against the honor code and can result in severe penalties, including failure of the assignment or even expulsion.\n\nTherefore, making a copy of an answer key without authorization is also considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Letting out tigers and monkeys to enliven a zoo fundraiser is morally wrong due to the potential harm to people and animals.\n\n- Scenario 2: Making a copy of an answer key is morally wrong because it constitutes cheating.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is \"Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nWait a second, but let's double-check. Maybe there's a different perspective that could categorize one of these actions as not morally wrong.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Is there any way that letting out the tigers and monkeys could be justified morally?\n\nWell, perhaps if it was done in a controlled environment with expert supervision and safety measures in place, but in the scenario described, it seems like a reckless action without considering the potential dangers.\n\nMoreover, zoos typically have strict protocols for animal handling, and deviating from these protocols without proper authorization or preparation would be irresponsible.\n\nSo, I don't see a way to justify this action morally; it remains wrong.\n\nNow, for Scenario 2: Making a copy of the answer key.\n\nSome might argue that in certain contexts, perhaps if the person making the copy intended to use it for studying or reviewing answers after the test, it might not necessarily be cheating. However, generally, answer keys are meant to be confidential and used only by instructors for grading purposes.\n\nIf a student makes a copy of the answer key before taking the test, it's almost certainly for the purpose of cheating. Even if they plan to use it after the test for review, it's still unauthorized and against rules.\n\nTherefore, in the absence of any specific context that justifies this action, making a copy of the answer key is morally wrong.\n\nSo, my final answer is \"Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
