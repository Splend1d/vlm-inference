                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this concept of a fixed action pattern in animals. It's a type of behavioral response that's pretty interesting, and I need to figure out which statement correctly describes it. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that it occurs the second time an animal is exposed to the correct stimulus at the appropriate time in its life. Hmm, that sounds a bit off. Fixed action patterns are typically innate behaviors that are performed the first time the animal encounters the triggering stimulus, right? I think they're programmed into the animal's genetics and don't require learning. So, if that's the case, it shouldn't be about the second exposure. Maybe this option isn't correct.\n\nOption B suggests that it occurs in the absence of sensory feedback. Let me think about that. Fixed action patterns are usually triggered by specific sensory stimuli in the environment. For example, a mother bird might clean its nest in response to seeing eggs or chicks. So, if sensory feedback is necessary to trigger the behavior, then saying it occurs in the absence of sensory feedback doesn't seem to align. Maybe not this one either.\n\nOption C mentions that it's a motor response which, once released, may be terminated spontaneously. Okay, so fixed action patterns are motor responses that are released in response to a sign stimulus. But I recall that once they start, they typically run their full course without interruption. They're kind of like automatic behaviors that play out to completion once initiated. So, saying they may be terminated spontaneously seems contradictory to that idea. Maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nThat leaves Option D: it is triggered by a number of sensory signals in the animal's environment. This seems to align with what I know about fixed action patterns. They are indeed triggered by specific stimuli, often called sign stimuli, in the environment. These stimuli can be visual, auditory, or other sensory cues that the animal detects. So, this option seems to accurately describe a key characteristic of fixed action patterns.\n\nLet me double-check my understanding. Fixed action patterns are innate, meaning they're genetically programmed and don't require learning. They are released in response to specific stimuli and typically continue until completion, regardless of whether the stimulus is still present. So, based on that, Option D seems to be the correct description.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider another example. Take the Lorenz's goose and its imprinting behavior. When a gosling hatches, it follows the first moving object it sees, usually its mother. This behavior is a fixed action pattern triggered by the sight of the mother goose. It's an innate behavior that's crucial for the gosling's survival. In this case, the sensory signal is visual \u2013 seeing the mother \u2013 which triggers the following behavior.\n\nAnother example is the mating dance of the grey wagtail. The male performs a specific dance to attract a mate. This behavior is also a fixed action pattern, triggered by the presence of a potential mate or specific environmental cues.\n\nIn both examples, the behavior is triggered by sensory signals in the environment, which matches Option D.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I believe the correct answer is Option D: is triggered by a number of sensory signals in the animal's environment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
