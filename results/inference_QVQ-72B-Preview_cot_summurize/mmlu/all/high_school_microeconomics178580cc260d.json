Let me see what the options are.\n\nOption A says that economics is primarily concerned with money. Hmm, I always thought economics was about more than just money. Like, it's about how people make choices with limited resources, right? So, maybe A isn't the best answer.\n\nOption B says it's primarily concerned with how resources are used. That sounds more familiar. I think economics is about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. So, that seems right.\n\nOption C says it relies solely on the scientific method for analysis. Well, economics does use the scientific method, but I don't think it relies solely on that. There's also normative economics, which deals with what ought to be, not just what is. So, maybe not solely scientific method.\n\nOption D says it's primarily concerned with maximizing spiritual well-being. That seems off. I thought economics was more about material well-being or utility maximization, not necessarily spiritual aspects.\n\nSo, between A, B, and D, B seems the most accurate. Let me double-check.\n\nEconomics is indeed a social science that studies how people use their resources. It looks at how individuals, businesses, and governments make choices about producing, consuming, and distributing goods and services. So, yes, it's about how resources are used.\n\nMoney is a part of that, but not the only aspect. And maximizing spiritual well-being isn't the primary focus; it's more about maximizing utility or satisfaction from material goods and services.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is B. It's primarily concerned with how resources are used.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Is there any chance that economics could be considered primarily about money? Well, monetary economics is a branch of economics that deals with money, but overall, economics is broader than just money.\n\nAnd what about the scientific method? Economics does use the scientific method in positive economics, where it makes testable predictions and hypotheses. But there's also normative economics, which involves value judgments and isn't purely scientific.\n\nAs for spiritual well-being, that seems more related to fields like positive psychology or philosophy, not traditional economics.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that B is the correct answer. Economics is primarily concerned with how resources are used.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
