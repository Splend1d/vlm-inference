                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Prime Corp. is a C corporation on an accrual basis, and it has a book income before federal income taxes of $300,000. This includes $17,000 of corporate bond interest income and a $20,000 expense for term life insurance premiums on corporate officers, where Prime is both the policy owner and the beneficiary.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Schedule M-1 is. It's a form that reconciles the income reported on the books with the income reported on the tax return for C corporations. So, my goal is to adjust the book income to find the taxable income.\n\nStarting with the book income before taxes: $300,000.\n\nNow, I need to consider the items that differ between book income and taxable income.\n\nFirst, the $17,000 corporate bond interest income. I recall that interest income is generally taxable, so this should already be included in the taxable income. Since it's included in the book income, I don't think I need to adjust for it again.\n\nNext, there's a $20,000 expense for term life insurance premiums on corporate officers, where Prime is the owner and beneficiary. I need to figure out how this affects taxable income.\n\nI remember that generally, premiums paid by a corporation for life insurance on its employees or officers where the corporation is the beneficiary are not deductible business expenses for tax purposes. So, if Prime Corp. paid premiums on a policy where they are the beneficiary, those premiums shouldn't be deductible on the tax return.\n\nBut on the books, they've expensed these premiums as a business expense, reducing book income by $20,000. However, for tax purposes, since it's not deductible, this expense shouldn't have been subtracted from income.\n\nTherefore, to reconcile from book income to taxable income, I need to add back this non-deductible expense to the book income.\n\nSo, starting with book income before taxes: $300,000.\n\nAdd back the non-deductible life insurance premium expense: $20,000.\n\nThis should give me the taxable income: $300,000 + $20,000 = $320,000.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check. Is the corporate bond interest income already included in taxable income? If so, and the only difference is the life insurance premium expense, then adding $20,000 back to the book income should give me the taxable income.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other adjustments needed. For example, does the corporate bond interest income need any special treatment? No, I think it's already included in taxable income.\n\nAlso, are there any other expenses or items that might affect the reconciliation? The problem only mentions these two items, so I'll assume that these are the only differences between book income and taxable income.\n\nTherefore, the current-year taxable income as reconciled on Prime's Schedule M-1 is $320,000.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $320,000\n\nB. $300,000\n\nC. $283,000\n\nD. $280,000\n\nSo, the correct answer should be A. $320,000.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other adjustment I might have missed.\n\nFor example, if the life insurance premiums were for key personnel and there are specific rules about deductibility, but I think generally, premiums on policies where the corporation is the beneficiary are not deductible.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the corporate bond interest income is subject to any special taxes or adjustments, but I don't think so in this context.\n\nAlso, since Prime Corp. is on an accrual basis, expenses are recognized when they're incurred, which aligns with tax rules, so no issues there.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the taxable income is $320,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 320000} \\]"
