                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a buyer and a seller who agreed on a price for an industrial air-conditioning system. Initially, they orally agreed on $100,000, but then they signed a written agreement later that said the price was $110,000. The system was delivered on June 1, but the buyer refused to pay more than $100,000, referring back to the earlier oral agreement. Now, the seller is suing for the extra $10,000 based on the written agreement. The question is whether the court will admit evidence of the orally agreed price of $100,000.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the oral agreement and the written agreement. It seems like they had an initial\u53e3\u5934 agreement on the price, but then they signed a written contract that specified a different price. The written contract didn't have a merger clause, which might be important because merger clauses typically prevent prior agreements from being introduced to contradict the written contract.\n\nOption A says that the evidence won't be admitted because the buyer assumed the risk of any mistake as to price. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. Assuming risk would involve the buyer accepting that there might be a mistake in the price or something, but I don't see clear evidence of that in the scenario. Maybe I need to look into that more.\n\nOption B says no, because the oral price term would contradict an express term in the written agreement. That makes sense at first glance. The written agreement clearly states $110,000, and the oral agreement is for $100,000, which is different. So, introducing the oral agreement would contradict the written term. But, I recall that the parol evidence rule generally prevents the introduction of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements that contradict the terms of a written contract. However, there are exceptions to this rule, and the absence of a merger clause might be one of them.\n\nOption C says yes, because the oral price term is relevant to whether the writing should be reformed. Reforming a contract usually involves correcting a mistake in the written document to reflect the true agreement of the parties. If there was a mutual mistake in drafting the written agreement, then the court might consider reforming it to match the actual agreement. In this case, if both parties initially agreed on $100,000, and the written agreement incorrectly states $110,000, then perhaps reformation would be appropriate.\n\nOption D says yes, because the written agreement did not contain a merger clause. A merger clause is a statement in the written contract that all prior negotiations and agreements are merged into the written document, and no evidence of prior agreements can be introduced to contradict it. Without a merger clause, it might be easier to introduce evidence of prior oral agreements.\n\nLet me try to piece this together. The parol evidence rule generally prohibits the introduction of oral evidence that contradicts the terms of a written contract. However, there are exceptions, such as when there's no merger clause, or when the written agreement is incomplete, or when there's evidence of fraud or mistake.\n\nIn this scenario, there's no merger clause, which might make it easier to introduce the oral agreement. But the written agreement is a lengthy form contract, which might suggest that it was intended to be comprehensive.\n\nThe buyer is refusing to pay more than $100,000, citing the earlier oral agreement. The seller is suing for the extra $10,000 based on the written agreement.\n\nI need to consider whether the oral agreement can be admitted to contradict the written agreement's price term.\n\nOption B seems to suggest that no, it can't be admitted because it contradicts the express term in the written agreement. But, as I thought earlier, the absence of a merger clause might allow for the introduction of prior oral agreements.\n\nOption C suggests that the oral agreement is relevant to reforming the written agreement. If both parties agreed on $100,000 and mistakenly wrote down $110,000, then perhaps the written agreement should be reformed to reflect the true agreement.\n\nOption D directly points out that the lack of a merger clause allows the evidence to be admitted.\n\nI think the key here is the absence of a merger clause. Without a merger clause, the parol evidence rule may not strictly apply, and the court might allow evidence of the prior oral agreement.\n\nHowever, even without a merger clause, the parol evidence rule generally prevents the introduction of prior agreements that contradict the written contract's express terms, unless there's a valid reason like fraud, duress, or mutual mistake.\n\nSo, if the written agreement is complete and unambiguous, the parol evidence rule would likely prevent the introduction of the oral agreement to contradict the written price term.\n\nBut, if there was a mutual mistake in drafting the written agreement, the court might consider reformation of the contract to reflect the true agreement of the parties.\n\nIn this scenario, it's not entirely clear whether there was a mutual mistake. The parties agreed orally on $100,000, continued to negotiate other points, and then signed a written agreement with $110,000. It's possible that during the negotiations, they agreed to increase the price to $110,000, or perhaps the written agreement included additional terms that justified the higher price.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a clerical error in writing down the price as $110,000 when they actually agreed on $100,000.\n\nGiven that they signed the written agreement, it suggests that they agreed to its terms, including the price of $110,000.\n\nUnless there's evidence that both parties believed the price was $100,000 and that the written agreement incorrectly stated $110,000 due to a mutual mistake, the court might not reform the contract.\n\nFrom the scenario, it seems that the buyer is relying on the earlier oral agreement, while the seller is suing based on the written agreement.\n\nIf the buyer wants to introduce evidence of the oral agreement to show that the written agreement should be reformed, they would need to prove that there was a mutual mistake in drafting the written agreement.\n\nOtherwise, the written agreement should prevail, and the oral agreement wouldn't be admissible to contradict its express terms.\n\nGiven that there's no merger clause, the court might be more inclined to consider evidence of the prior negotiations, but they would still need to determine whether the written agreement is the final expression of the parties' agreement.\n\nSince the written agreement was signed after all matters were settled, it's likely intended to be the final agreement.\n\nIn such a case, the parol evidence rule would generally prevent the introduction of the prior oral agreement to contradict the written price term.\n\nTherefore, I think Option B is the correct answer: No, because the oral price term would contradict an express term in the written agreement.\n\nHowever, I need to consider whether the absence of a merger clause changes this.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, even without a merger clause, the parol evidence rule would still prevent the introduction of prior agreements that contradict the written contract's express terms.\n\nIn others, the absence of a merger clause might allow for the introduction of prior agreements to supplement or explain the written agreement, but not necessarily to contradict its express terms.\n\nGiven that, I think Option B is still the most accurate answer.\n\nOption D suggests that yes, the evidence will be admitted because there's no merger clause, but I think that's only partially true, as the parol evidence rule would still apply to prevent contradiction of express terms.\n\nOption C suggests that the oral agreement is relevant to reforming the written agreement, but without evidence of a mutual mistake in drafting the written agreement, reformation might not be appropriate.\n\nTherefore, I believe the court is unlikely to admit the evidence of the orally agreed price of $100,000, because it would contradict an express term in the written agreement.\n\nSo, the answer is B. No, because the oral price term would contradict an express term in the written agreement."
