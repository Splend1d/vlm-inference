                    "text": "So I have this question about DNA replication, and I need to figure out the ratio of A:T bases in the newly synthesized strand if the template strand has a ratio of 3:2 A:T. Let me make sure I understand what's going on here.\n\nFirst off, DNA polymerase is the enzyme that makes new DNA strands during replication. It uses one of the original DNA strands as a template to add the correct nucleotides to build the new strand. The new strand is complementary to the template strand, meaning that the bases pair up specifically: A with T and C with G.\n\nSo, if the template strand has a ratio of A:T of 3:2, that means for every 3 A's, there are 2 T's. Now, in the newly synthesized strand, since A pairs with T and T pairs with A, the ratio should be inverted, right? Because where there's an A in the template, there will be a T in the new strand, and vice versa.\n\nLet me think about this again. If the template has more A's than T's (3:2), then the new strand should have more T's corresponding to those A's and fewer A's corresponding to the T's. So, if the template has 3 A's and 2 T's, the new strand should have 3 T's and 2 A's. That would make the ratio of A:T in the new strand 2:3.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check. Base pairing rules state that A pairs with T and T pairs with A. So, if the template has A in a certain position, the new strand will have T there, and if the template has T, the new strand will have A.\n\nSo, if we have a sequence in the template like this: A A A T T (which is 3 A's and 2 T's), the complementary sequence in the new strand would be: T T T A A (which is 3 T's and 2 A's). So, the ratio flips to 2:3 for A:T in the new strand.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 3:02\n\nB. 1:01\n\nC. 2:03\n\nD. cannot be determined\n\nSo, 2:3 would be option C. But let's make sure there isn't some trick here.\n\nIs there any possibility that the ratio could be different based on the total number of bases or something like that? I don't think so. The ratio should directly invert based on the base pairing rules.\n\nLet me consider another example. If the template has a ratio of 1:1 A:T, then the new strand should also have a ratio of 1:1, because for every A in the template, there's a T in the new strand, and for every T in the template, there's an A in the new strand. So, same ratio, which makes sense.\n\nWait, but in the question, the template has 3 A's and 2 T's, and the new strand has 2 A's and 3 T's, which is ratio 2:3. So, it seems consistent.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the concept of base composition. In DNA, the percentage of A equals the percentage of T, and percentage of C equals percentage of G, due to base pairing. But in this case, we're dealing with ratios, not percentages.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in reality, in natural DNA, the amount of A does equal the amount of T, and C equals G, but in this problem, we're given a template strand with a specific ratio, which is not balanced, and we're to find the ratio in the newly synthesized strand.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is C, 2:3.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect this.\n\n- Option A is 3:2, which is the same as the template, but that doesn't make sense because that would imply the new strand has the same ratio as the template, which shouldn't be the case.\n\n- Option B is 1:1, which would mean equal A's and T's, but given that the template has more A's than T's, the new strand should have more T's than A's.\n\n- Option D says cannot be determined, but since we know the ratio in the template, and base pairing is straightforward, it should be determinable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 2:3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
