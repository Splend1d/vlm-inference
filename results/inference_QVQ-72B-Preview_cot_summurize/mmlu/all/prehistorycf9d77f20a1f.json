                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about the pharaoh and the population he ruled. It says that the pharaoh ruled a population of a certain number, and a certain percentage of that population were farmers. The options are:\n\nA. 100,000; 25%\n\nB. 1,000,000; 50%\n\nC. 3,000,000; 75%\n\nD. 5,000,000; 100%\n\nAnd the blank spaces are supposed to be filled with the correct numbers. I need to figure out which one makes sense.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the context. Pharaohs were rulers of ancient Egypt, right? And ancient Egypt was known for its agricultural basis, especially the Nile River valley where they grew a lot of crops. So, farming was probably a significant part of their economy and society.\n\nBut, I don't have a specific number to cross-reference here. Maybe I should look at the percentages and see which one seems plausible for the number of farmers in the population.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nOption A: 100,000 total population with 25% farmers. So, that would be 25,000 farmers.\n\nOption B: 1,000,000 total population with 50% farmers. That's 500,000 farmers.\n\nOption C: 3,000,000 total population with 75% farmers. That would be 2,250,000 farmers.\n\nOption D: 5,000,000 total population with 100% farmers. That's all farmers, which seems unlikely because there must have been other professions like artisans, soldiers, priests, etc.\n\nNow, I need to think about the historical context. In ancient Egypt, agriculture was indeed a cornerstone of their society, but I doubt that every single person was a farmer. So, option D seems less likely.\n\nBut, I need to narrow it down more. Let's think about the population sizes. Ancient Egypt during its peak had a substantial population, but I'm not sure exactly how big.\n\nI recall that in the New Kingdom period, which was around 1550-1070 BCE, the population of Egypt might have been in the millions. Some estimates suggest that the population of ancient Egypt could have reached up to 3-5 million people at its height.\n\nBut, I need to consider the time period. Pharaohs ruled from the beginning of Egyptian civilization around 3100 BCE up to the Ptolemaic period in the first century BCE. So, population sizes varied over time.\n\nGiven that, option C and D have 3,000,000 and 5,000,000 respectively, which seem quite high for most of ancient Egyptian history, except perhaps during its peak.\n\nOption B has 1,000,000, which might be more reasonable for a large part of ancient Egyptian history.\n\nOption A has only 100,000, which might be too small, unless it's referring to a specific city or region, but the pharaoh ruled the entire country.\n\nNow, considering the percentage of farmers. In ancient agricultural societies, the majority of the population was typically engaged in farming because agricultural productivity wasn't as efficient as today, so more people were needed to produce food.\n\nIn ancient Egypt, it's likely that around 80-90% of the population was involved in agriculture, but I'm not sure about the exact figure.\n\nGiven that, option C has 75% farmers, which seems plausible, while option B has 50%, which might be a bit low for an agricultural society.\n\nOption A has 25%, which seems too low, unless there were significant non-farming sectors, which isn't likely in ancient times.\n\nSo, between options B and C, C seems more plausible with 3,000,000 population and 75% farmers.\n\nBut, I need to make sure. Let's see if there's any other way to approach this.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps considering the labor required for building pyramids and other monumental structures. Ancient Egypt was known for its massive construction projects, which would have required a large workforce, including farmers during certain times of the year when agricultural work was less demanding.\n\nHowever, this might not directly help in determining the total population or the percentage of farmers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the carrying capacity of the Nile valley. The Nile provided irrigation for agriculture, and the amount of arable land would have supported a certain population size.\n\nBut, without specific data, this is speculative.\n\nLet me consider the other options again.\n\nOption D suggests 100% farmers, which is unlikely, as there must have been other professions necessary for the society to function, like administrators, priests, soldiers, artisans, etc.\n\nOption A has only 100,000 population with 25% farmers, which seems too small and too low a percentage.\n\nOption B has 1,000,000 population with 50% farmers. This might be possible, but I think the percentage of farmers was higher in ancient Egypt.\n\nOption C has 3,000,000 population with 75% farmers. This seems reasonable, as it aligns with estimates of ancient Egyptian population sizes and the likely proportion of farmers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the population was larger, but with a higher percentage of farmers.\n\nWait, option D is 5,000,000 with 100% farmers, which again seems improbable.\n\nI think the best answer is option C: 3,000,000 population with 75% farmers.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's consider the average population of ancient Egyptian cities or regions.\n\nFor example, the city of Thebes during the New Kingdom was one of the largest cities in the ancient world, and its population might have been around 30,000 to 40,000 people.\n\nBut, the entire population of Egypt would have been much larger, possibly in the millions.\n\nTherefore, options B and C seem plausible in terms of population size.\n\nRegarding the percentage of farmers, in ancient agricultural societies, typically around 80-90% of the population was engaged in agriculture.\n\nSo, option C's 75% might be a bit low, but it's closer than option B's 50%.\n\nOption A's 25% seems too low for an ancient agricultural society.\n\nTherefore, I think option C is the most reasonable choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
