                    "text": "Hair loss is a common concern for both men and women, although the patterns and causes can differ. Let's look at each option one by one to understand hair loss better.\n\nOption A states that men lose hair but women do not. This is incorrect because both men and women can experience hair loss. However, the patterns and causes might differ between genders.\n\nOption B suggests that men are more systematic than women in terms of hair loss. This might refer to the pattern of hair loss. In men, hair loss often follows a distinct pattern, such as receding hairline or bald spots, which could be considered more \"systematic.\" In women, hair loss is more commonly diffuse, meaning the hair thins out evenly over the scalp. So, in this sense, men's hair loss might be more predictable in pattern.\n\nOption C claims that women lose hair less frequently but more rapidly than men. This is misleading. In reality, men are more likely to experience pattern baldness, which can progress rapidly in some cases. Women, on the other hand, may experience hair thinning, which might not lead to complete baldness but can still be significant. The frequency and rate of hair loss can vary widely between individuals of both sexes.\n\nOption D posits that environmental factors are the main causes of hair loss. While environmental factors can contribute to hair loss, genetics play a significant role, especially in pattern baldness for both men and women. Other factors include hormonal changes, medical conditions, medications, and certain hairstyles or treatments that can cause traction alopecia.\n\nIn summary, both men and women can experience hair loss, but the patterns and causes may differ. Genetics are a primary factor, though environmental and other factors can also influence hair loss.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
