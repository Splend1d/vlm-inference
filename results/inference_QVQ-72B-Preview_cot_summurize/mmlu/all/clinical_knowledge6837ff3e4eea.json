                    "text": "So I need to figure out the normal range of flexion at the knee joint. The options are:\n\nA. 0-115 degrees.\n\nB. 0-135 degrees.\n\nC. 0-155 degrees.\n\nD. 0-175 degrees.\n\nHmm, I remember that knee flexion typically goes from a straight leg to a bent position, but I'm not sure about the exact degree range. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I know that a straight leg is considered 0 degrees of flexion. So, starting from there, as the leg bends, the angle between the thigh and the lower leg increases, right? Wait, no. Actually, when you bend your knee, the angle decreases because it's a hinge joint. So, full extension is 0 degrees, and as you flex, the angle gets smaller.\n\nWait, but in terms of measurement, does the angle increase or decrease? I think I might be confusing myself. Let me try to clarify this.\n\nIf I have my leg fully extended, the angle between my thigh and lower leg is 0 degrees. When I bend my knee, say, to sit down, the angle between my thigh and lower leg increases in terms of the actual angle measurement, but the flexion angle is measured differently. I think there's some confusion here.\n\nMaybe I should look at it this way: in anatomy, the knee joint's movement is defined such that full extension is 0 degrees, and maximum flexion is around 135-160 degrees. So, option B is 0-135 degrees, which seems plausible.\n\nBut I've also heard of deep knee bends or squats where people can flex their knees beyond 135 degrees. For example, in a full squat, the knee might flex up to 160 degrees or more. So, maybe the normal range is higher than 135 degrees.\n\nLet me consider what \"normal\" range means. Does it refer to the average range of motion for most people, or the full potential range that can be achieved with flexibility training?\n\nProbably, it's referring to the average range of motion for healthy adults. In that case, 0-135 degrees seems a bit limited because many people can flex their knees beyond that.\n\nOption C is 0-155 degrees, which might be more accurate. I think the normal range of knee flexion is around 0-160 degrees, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the normal range is defined differently based on age or activity level. For example, athletes might have greater flexibility, while older adults might have less.\n\nI should consider that the knee joint's flexion can vary based on individual anatomy and physical condition. However, for the purpose of this question, I think they're looking for a general range.\n\nLet me try to recall if there's a standard measure for knee flexion. I think in physical therapy and medical assessments, the normal knee flexion range is considered to be from 0 to 135 degrees. So, option B seems familiar.\n\nBut I also recall that some people can flex their knees up to 160 degrees or more, especially with flexibility training or in certain cultural practices like squatting.\n\nMaybe the key here is to consider what is considered \"normal\" in a general population, not just in highly flexible individuals.\n\nIn that case, 0-135 degrees might be a reasonable estimate for the normal range of knee flexion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the full range is up to 160 degrees, and anything beyond that is considered excessive flexion.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the extreme positions. Full extension is 0 degrees, and full flexion is around 135-160 degrees, but not everyone can reach the maximum.\n\nSo, perhaps the normal range is defined as 0-135 degrees, and anything beyond that is considered above normal.\n\nBut I'm not sure. This is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I can look up the standard range of motion for the knee joint in a textbook or a reliable source.\n\nI recall that in standard anatomical references, the normal range of knee flexion is typically cited as 0-135 degrees. So, option B seems to align with that.\n\nHowever, I've also come across references that indicate a normal range up to 150 degrees or even 160 degrees.\n\nMaybe the variation is due to different measurement techniques or population samples.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the person is measured in a seated or standing position, or whether the measurement includes overpressure.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think about the anatomical definition of knee flexion.\n\nThe knee joint is a hinge joint that primarily allows flexion and extension. Full extension is 0 degrees, and flexion is measured positive from there.\n\nIn some medical systems, there might be a slight overextension, meaning negative degrees, but for the sake of this question, I think we can ignore that.\n\nSo, starting from 0 degrees, which is full extension, flexion increases as the leg bends.\n\nNow, considering that, what is the typical maximum flexion angle?\n\nI think 135 degrees is a common figure, but as I said earlier, some people can flex their knees further.\n\nPerhaps the normal range is defined conservatively as 0-135 degrees, considering that most people can achieve at least that much flexion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the normal range is considered to be up to 155 degrees, as in option C.\n\nI need to make a decision here. Based on my recollection of standard anatomical references, I think 0-135 degrees is the generally accepted normal range for knee flexion.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with option B: 0-135 degrees.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider if there's any reason to choose otherwise.\n\nFor example, in some activities like deep squats or certain yoga poses, people might flex their knees beyond 135 degrees.\n\nHowever, these are often individuals who have specifically trained their flexibility, whereas the \"normal\" range might be less.\n\nTherefore, in a general sense, 0-135 degrees seems appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the knee can flex up to 155 degrees in many people, maybe option C is better.\n\nBut I think for the purpose of this question, 0-135 degrees is the standard normal range.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. 0-135 degrees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
