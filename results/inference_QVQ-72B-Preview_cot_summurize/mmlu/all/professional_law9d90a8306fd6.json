                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a developer who owns a bunch of land in a rural area and has created a general development plan for it. The plan includes various restrictions and limitations that are supposed to apply to anyone who buys any of the lots, including their heirs and people they might sell or lease the land to. One of the restrictions mentions a \"franchise right\" for public utility companies to use a 10-foot strip of land along the rear of each lot, and they have the right to go in and out of that area as needed. Another restriction says that no houses or any kind of structures can be built on that 10-foot strip.\n\nNow, the question is asking what this \"franchise right\" for public utility companies would most likely be an example of. The options are:\n\nA. license\n\nB. equitable servitude\n\nC. easement appurtenant\n\nD. easement in gross\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to understand what each of these terms means and see which one fits the situation described.\n\nFirst, a license. From what I recall, a license is a personal privilege that allows someone to use another's property for a specific purpose, but it's not a property interest. It's revocable and doesn't pass with the land. So, it's more of a permission that can be taken away at any time.\n\nNext, an equitable servitude. This sounds like a restriction on the use of land that's enforced through equity, maybe something to do with covenants running with the land. I think it's a type of restriction that binds subsequent owners because it's attached to the land itself, not just to the current owner.\n\nThen, there's an easement appurtenant. An easement is a right to use another's property for a specific purpose. \"Appurtenant\" means it's attached to the land and benefits the land, typically for the benefit of one piece of land and burdens another. So, it's usually between two pieces of land, where one has the right to use part of the other.\n\nLastly, an easement in gross. This is similar to an easement appurtenant but isn't attached to any particular piece of land. It's a personal right to use someone else's land for a specific purpose, and it can be held by an individual or an entity like a utility company.\n\nGiven that, let's look back at the scenario. The developer is creating a plan where a 10-foot strip along the rear of each lot is being set aside for public utility companies to use, with the right to go in and out as needed. Also, no structures can be built on that strip.\n\nThis sounds like it's giving the utility companies a right to use that part of the land for their purposes, like maybe laying cables, pipes, or maintaining utility lines. Since it's for public utilities, it's likely that multiple companies might need access to this area for things like electricity, gas, water, etc.\n\nNow, considering that, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. License: A license seems too temporary and revocable for this situation. It doesn't seem to fit because the restriction is meant to be permanent and binding on all future owners.\n\nB. Equitable servitude: This seems more related to restrictions on how the land can be used, like not building structures on the strip. While that might be part of it, the \"franchise right\" specifically mentions the use of the land by public utility companies, which sounds more like an easement.\n\nC. Easement appurtenant: This type of easement benefits one piece of land and burdens another. But in this case, the utility companies aren't owning any specific piece of land that's benefiting from this easement. They're just using the strips for their utilities, which are likely serving the entire development.\n\nD. Easement in gross: This seems the most fitting because it's a right held by the utility companies (entities) to use the land for specific purposes, which is maintaining and operating their utilities. It's not attached to any particular piece of land benefiting from it; rather, it's a general right for the utilities to access and use that strip.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that it's described as a \"franchise right\" suggests it's a granted right to use the land for a specific purpose, which aligns with an easement in gross.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, I think the correct answer is D. easement in gross.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nCould it be an equitable servitude? Well, servitudes are generally about restricting how land can be used, and while there is a restriction against building on the strip, the \"franchise right\" seems more about granting a right to use the land, not just restricting its use.\n\nA license seems unlikely because it's too transient and not binding on future owners, whereas the plan explicitly states that the restrictions are to extend to all subsequent owners and are to be charged with due notice.\n\nAn easement appurtenant might be possible if there's a specific benefiting land, but in this case, it's for utility companies, which are likely serving the entire development, not just one particular piece of land.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate classification for this \"franchise right\" is an easement in gross.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
