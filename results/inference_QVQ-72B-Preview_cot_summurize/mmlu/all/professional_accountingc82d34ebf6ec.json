                    "text": "So I'm dealing with a situation where, during a compilation engagement for a nonissuer, I've found that management has valued land at its appraised value instead of following Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). If GAAP had been followed, both the land account and stockholders' equity would have been decreased by $1 million, which is a material amount. Management isn't willing to adjust the financial statements to comply with GAAP, so I need to modify my compilation report accordingly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a compilation engagement entails. Unlike an audit or a review, a compilation doesn't involve expressing an opinion or any assurance on the financial statements. Instead, it's about presenting the financial information in a proper format and ensuring it's free from obvious errors. However, when there's a departure from GAAP that's material, I need to address that in my report.\n\nOption A suggests issuing either an adverse opinion or a qualified opinion based on materiality. But wait, opinions are typically associated with audits, not compilations. In a compilation engagement, I don't express an opinion; I provide a disclaimer of opinion. So, this seems inappropriate for a compilation.\n\nOption B proposes adding a separate paragraph to restrict the distribution of the financial statements to \"internal use only.\" This might be relevant in some cases, but it doesn't directly address the departure from GAAP. Moreover, restricting distribution might not be sufficient if the departure is material and could mislead users of the financial statements.\n\nOption C suggests adding a separate paragraph to disclose the departure from GAAP and its effects on the financial statements. This seems reasonable because it informs the users about the non-compliance with GAAP and the impact it has on the financial statements. Transparency is key here, especially since the departure is material.\n\nOption D mentions adding a separate paragraph to explain the underlying purpose of recording assets at historical cost. While historical cost is a fundamental principle in GAAP, this option doesn't directly address the specific issue at hand, which is the misstatement in the land account and stockholders' equity due to using appraised value instead of historical cost.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C appears to be the most appropriate course of action. By adding a separate paragraph to disclose the departure from GAAP and its effects, I'm being transparent about the non-compliance and its material impact on the financial statements. This should help users understand the limitations of the financial statements and make informed decisions.\n\nLet me double-check this. In a compilation engagement, the accountant is required to disclose departures from GAAP if management refuses to adjust the financial statements. According to Statement on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARS), specifically SSARS 21, when financial statements depart from GAAP in a material way, and management won't make the necessary adjustments, the accountant should modify the compilation report to describe the nature of the departure and its effect on the financial statements.\n\nSo, yes, option C aligns with these requirements. It's important to note that in a compilation engagement, unlike in an audit, the accountant doesn't provide assurance on the financial statements, but they do have a responsibility to disclose significant departures from GAAP.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider why the other options aren't suitable:\n\n- Option A: As mentioned earlier, in a compilation engagement, the accountant doesn't express an opinion; therefore, issuing an adverse or qualified opinion isn't appropriate.\n\n- Option B: Restricting the distribution of the financial statements to internal use only might not be sufficient to address the material departure from GAAP. External users might still access the statements, and without proper disclosure, they could be misled.\n\n- Option D: Explaining the underlying purpose of historical cost doesn't directly address the specific issue of the misstatement in the financial statements due to using appraised value.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is option C: add a separate paragraph to the accountant's report that discloses the departure from GAAP and its effects on the financial statements.\n\nTo summarize, in this scenario, since management won't adjust the financial statements to comply with GAAP despite a material departure, the accountant must modify the compilation report to disclose this departure and its impact. This ensures that users of the financial statements are aware of the non-compliance and can adjust their analyses accordingly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
