                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out for which values of c in Z_3 the quotient ring Z_3[x]/(x^3 + c x^2 + 1) is a field. I know that a quotient ring is a field if and only if the ideal we're quotienting by is maximal. In the case of polynomial rings over fields, like Z_3[x], which is a principal ideal domain, a maximal ideal is generated by an irreducible polynomial.\n\nSo, in this problem, Z_3 is the field with three elements, {0, 1, 2}, and we're looking at the polynomial x^3 + c x^2 + 1 in Z_3[x]. We need to find all c in Z_3 such that this polynomial is irreducible over Z_3.\n\nFirst, I should recall what it means for a polynomial to be irreducible. A polynomial is irreducible if it cannot be factored into the product of non-constant polynomials of lower degree. Since we're dealing with a cubic polynomial, if it's not irreducible, it must factor into either a linear and a quadratic polynomial, or three linear polynomials.\n\nBut in Z_3, since it's a small field, maybe I can just test each possible c value and see if the polynomial has any roots in Z_3. If it doesn't have any roots, then it must be irreducible because a cubic polynomial over a field either has a root or it's irreducible.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate. If a cubic polynomial has no roots in the field, it could still factor into two quadratics, but in Z_3, since the degree is three, if it's not irreducible, it must have a linear factor because of the degree considerations.\n\nActually, in a field, a cubic polynomial is either irreducible or has a linear factor. So, if it has no roots, it's irreducible.\n\nSo, my plan is to plug in each possible c in Z_3, which are 0, 1, and 2, and check if the polynomial x^3 + c x^2 + 1 has any roots in Z_3. If it doesn't have any roots for a particular c, then that polynomial is irreducible, and thus Z_3[x]/(x^3 + c x^2 + 1) is a field.\n\nLet's start with c = 0.\n\nThe polynomial is x^3 + 1.\n\nLet's check if it has roots in Z_3.\n\nTest x = 0: 0^3 + 1 = 1 \u2260 0.\n\nx = 1: 1^3 + 1 = 2 \u2260 0.\n\nx = 2: 2^3 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \u2261 0 mod 3.\n\nSo, x = 2 is a root.\n\nTherefore, for c = 0, the polynomial has a root, so it's not irreducible. Hence, Z_3[x]/(x^3 + 0 x^2 + 1) is not a field.\n\nNext, c = 1.\n\nThe polynomial is x^3 + x^2 + 1.\n\nTest x = 0: 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \u2260 0.\n\nx = 1: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \u2261 0 mod 3.\n\nSo, x = 1 is a root.\n\nAgain, it has a root, so it's reducible.\n\nThus, Z_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + 1) is not a field.\n\nNow, c = 2.\n\nThe polynomial is x^3 + 2 x^2 + 1.\n\nTest x = 0: 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \u2260 0.\n\nx = 1: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 \u2261 1 \u2260 0 mod 3.\n\nx = 2: 8 + 8 + 1 = 17 \u2261 17 mod 3.\n\n17 divided by 3 is 5 with a remainder of 2, so 17 \u2261 2 \u2260 0 mod 3.\n\nWait, let me compute that again.\n\n8 + 8 + 1 = 17.\n\n17 divided by 3 is 5 with remainder 2, so 17 \u2261 2 mod 3.\n\nBut in Z_3, 2 \u2260 0.\n\nSo, for c = 2, the polynomial x^3 + 2 x^2 + 1 has no roots in Z_3.\n\nTherefore, it's irreducible, and Z_3[x]/(x^3 + 2 x^2 + 1) is a field.\n\nSo, the only c in Z_3 that makes Z_3[x]/(x^3 + c x^2 + 1) a field is c = 2.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0\n\nB. 2\n\nC. 1\n\nD. 3\n\nBut D is 3, which is not in Z_3, since Z_3 = {0,1,2}.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 2.\n\nWait, but the question says \"all c in Z_3\", and I only found c=2. Are there any others?\n\nLet me double-check c=2.\n\nFor c=2, the polynomial is x^3 + 2x^2 + 1.\n\nWe checked that it has no roots in Z_3.\n\nIs there any chance it could factor into two quadratics?\n\nIn Z_3, the only quadratic is of the form (x^2 + a x + b), but since the degree is three, and we've already checked it has no roots, and in a field, a cubic either has a root or is irreducible, so it must be irreducible.\n\nTherefore, only c=2 satisfies the condition.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
