If it's invalid, I have to pick the correct counterexample from the options provided.\n\nFirst, let's understand the argument:\n\nWe have:\n\nJ \u2261 ~K\n\nJ \u2228 L\n\n~K / L\n\nI think the \"/ L\" means that from ~K, we're supposed to conclude L. So, the argument is:\n\nFrom J \u2261 ~K and J \u2228 L, infer ~K \u2192 L.\n\nMy goal is to see if this argument is valid, meaning that whenever the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo do this, I'll construct a truth table for all possible truth values of J, K, and L, and then evaluate each part of the argument.\n\nFirst, identify the variables: J, K, and L.\n\nSo, there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations of truth values.\n\nLet's list them:\n\n1. J is true, K is true, L is true\n\n2. J is true, K is true, L is false\n\n3. J is true, K is false, L is true\n\n4. J is true, K is false, L is false\n\n5. J is false, K is true, L is true\n\n6. J is false, K is true, L is false\n\n7. J is false, K is false, L is true\n\n8. J is false, K is false, L is false\n\nNow, for each of these, I need to evaluate:\n\n- J \u2261 ~K (this is a biconditional, so it's true if both sides are equal)\n\n- J \u2228 L (a disjunction, true if J is true or L is true or both)\n\n- ~K \u2192 L (a conditional, true except when ~K is true and L is false)\n\nI need to check if whenever both premises (J \u2261 ~K) and (J \u2228 L) are true, then (~K \u2192 L) is also true.\n\nLet's build the truth table step by step.\n\nFirst, list all possible truth values for J, K, and L:\n\nJ | K | L\n\nT | T | T\n\nT | T | F\n\nT | F | T\n\nT | F | F\n\nF | T | T\n\nF | T | F\n\nF | F | T\n\nF | F | F\n\nNow, compute ~K for each row:\n\n~K is true when K is false.\n\nSo:\n\nJ | K | L | ~K\n\nT | T | T | F\n\nT | T | F | F\n\nT | F | T | T\n\nT | F | F | T\n\nF | T | T | F\n\nF | T | F | F\n\nF | F | T | T\n\nF | F | F | T\n\nNext, compute J \u2261 ~K (the biconditional):\n\nThis is true if J and ~K are both true or both false.\n\nSo:\n\nJ | ~K | J \u2261 ~K\n\nT | F | F\n\nT | F | F\n\nT | T | T\n\nT | T | T\n\nF | F | T\n\nF | F | T\n\nF | T | F\n\nF | T | F\n\nSo, the table so far:\n\nJ | K | L | ~K | J \u2261 ~K\n\nT | T | T | F | F\n\nT | T | F | F | F\n\nT | F | T | T | T\n\nT | F | F | T | T\n\nF | T | T | F | T\n\nF | T | F | F | T\n\nF | F | T | T | F\n\nF | F | F | T | F\n\nNext, compute J \u2228 L (disjunction):\n\nThis is true if J is true or L is true or both.\n\nSo:\n\nJ | L | J \u2228 L\n\nT | T | T\n\nT | F | T\n\nT | T | T\n\nT | F | T\n\nF | T | T\n\nF | F | F\n\nF | T | T\n\nF | F | F\n\nNow, the table looks like:\n\nJ | K | L | ~K | J \u2261 ~K | J \u2228 L\n\nT | T | T | F | F | T\n\nT | T | F | F | F | T\n\nT | F | T | T | T | T\n\nT | F | F | T | T | T\n\nF | T | T | F | T | T\n\nF | T | F | F | T | F\n\nF | F | T | T | F | T\n\nF | F | F | T | F | F\n\nFinally, compute ~K \u2192 L:\n\nThis is false only when ~K is true and L is false.\n\nFrom the ~K column:\n\n~K is true in rows 3,4,7,8.\n\nSo, ~K \u2192 L is false only in rows where ~K is true and L is false.\n\nLooking at rows 3 and 4:\n\nRow 3: ~K is true, L is true \u2192 ~K \u2192 L is true\n\nRow 4: ~K is true, L is false \u2192 ~K \u2192 L is false\n\nRow 7: ~K is true, L is true \u2192 ~K \u2192 L is true\n\nRow 8: ~K is true, L is false \u2192 ~K \u2192 L is false\n\nIn the other rows, ~K is false, so ~K \u2192 L is true.\n\nSo, ~K \u2192 L is false only in rows 4 and 8.\n\nTherefore, the complete truth table is:\n\nJ | K | L | ~K | J \u2261 ~K | J \u2228 L | ~K \u2192 L\n\nT | T | T | F | F | T | T\n\nT | T | F | F | F | T | T\n\nT | F | T | T | T | T | T\n\nT | F | F | T | T | T | F\n\nF | T | T | F | T | T | T\n\nF | T | F | F | T | F | T\n\nF | F | T | T | F | T | T\n\nF | F | F | T | F | F | F\n\nNow, the argument is: If (J \u2261 ~K) and (J \u2228 L), then ~K \u2192 L.\n\nIn terms of the truth table, we need to find rows where both premises are true and see if the conclusion is true in those rows.\n\nSo, identify rows where (J \u2261 ~K) is true and (J \u2228 L) is true.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 3: J \u2261 ~K is true, J \u2228 L is true, ~K \u2192 L is true.\n\nRow 4: J \u2261 ~K is true, J \u2228 L is true, ~K \u2192 L is false.\n\nSo, in row 4, the premises are true, but the conclusion is false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nNow, I need to pick the correct counterexample from the options.\n\nOption B: Invalid. Counterexample when J and K are true and L is false.\n\nLooking back at the table, when J is true, K is true, L is false (row 2):\n\nFrom the table, row 2: J \u2261 ~K is false, so the premises are not both true.\n\nNot a counterexample.\n\nOption C: Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and K and L are false.\n\nLooking at row 4: J is true, K is false, L is false.\n\nFrom the table, row 4: J \u2261 ~K is true, J \u2228 L is true, ~K \u2192 L is false.\n\nSo, premises true, conclusion false. This is a counterexample.\n\nOption D: Invalid. Counterexample when K is true and J and L are false.\n\nLooking at row 6: J is false, K is true, L is false.\n\nFrom the table, row 6: J \u2261 ~K is true, J \u2228 L is false.\n\nSo, one premise is false. Not a counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is Option C: Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and K and L are false.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the table, row 4 corresponds to J true, K false, L false.\n\nBut option C says J true, K false, L false, which matches row 4, where the argument fails.\n\nOption B mentions J true, K true, L false, which is row 2, but in row 2, one of the premises is false, so it's not a valid counterexample.\n\nOption D mentions K true, J and L false, which is row 6, where again, one of the premises is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option C.\n\nWait, but Option C says \"when J is true and K and L are false,\" which is row 4, which is indeed a counterexample.\n\nOption B is not, because in row 2, one of the premises is false.\n\nOption D is not, because in row 6, one of the premises is false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is invalid, and the correct counterexample is Option C.\n\nBut according to the options, Option C is \"Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and K and L are false,\" which is row 4, and that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the options, Option B is \"Invalid. Counterexample when J and K are true and L is false,\" which is row 2, but in row 2, one of the premises is false, so it's not a counterexample.\n\nOption C is \"Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and K and L are false,\" which is row 4, and in row 4, both premises are true and the conclusion is false, so it's a valid counterexample.\n\nOption D is \"Invalid. Counterexample when K is true and J and L are false,\" which is row 6, but in row 6, one of the premises is false, so it's not a counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is Option C.\n\nBut looking back, in the options, it seems there might be a typo or confusion in wording.\n\nOption B: Invalid. Counterexample when J and K are true and L is false.\n\nBut in row 2, which corresponds to J true, K true, L false, the premise J \u2261 ~K is false, so it's not a counterexample.\n\nOption C: Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and K and L are false.\n\nThis corresponds to row 4: J true, K false, L false.\n\nIn row 4, both premises are true, and the conclusion is false, so it's a valid counterexample.\n\nOption D: Invalid. Counterexample when K is true and J and L are false.\n\nThis is row 6: J false, K true, L false.\n\nIn row 6, J \u2228 L is false, so one premise is false, not a counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option C.\n\nBut the problem asks to \"choose an option which presents a counterexample,\" and among the options, Option C is the correct counterexample.\n\nHowever, looking back, in the user's question, Option B is \"Invalid. Counterexample when J and K are true and L is false,\" which corresponds to row 2, where one of the premises is false, so it's not a counterexample.\n\nOption C is \"Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and K and L are false,\" which corresponds to row 4, where both premises are true and the conclusion is false.\n\nOption D is \"Invalid. Counterexample when K is true and J and L are false,\" which corresponds to row 6, where one premise is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is Option C.\n\nBut in the user's options, Option C seems to be the correct counterexample.\n\nHowever, in the truth table, row 4 corresponds to J true, K false, L false, which matches Option C.\n\nTherefore, the argument is invalid, and the counterexample is Option C.\n\nBut according to the answer choices provided by the user, Option C is \"Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and K and L are false,\" which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Option C.\n\nWait, but the user's options are labeled as:\n\nA. Valid\n\nB. Invalid. Counterexample when J and K are true and L is false\n\nC. Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and K and L are false\n\nD. Invalid. Counterexample when K is true and J and L are false\n\nAnd based on the truth table, Option C is the correct counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
