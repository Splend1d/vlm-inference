                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a photon striking an electron that's initially at rest, and as a result, an electron-positron pair is created. The photon is destroyed in the process, and the positron and the two electrons (the initial one and the newly created one) move off at equal speeds in the direction the photon was initially moving. We need to find the energy of the photon, and the options are multiples of mc\u00b2.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic concepts about particles and photons. A photon has energy E = hc/\u03bb, where h is Planck's constant and \u03bb is the wavelength. But since we're dealing with relativistic processes involving particle creation, I think it's better to think in terms of energy and momentum conservation.\n\nSo, the principles here are conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. The photon has energy E_photon, and no rest mass, so its energy is related to its momentum by E_photon = pc, where p is the momentum and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe initial electron is at rest, so its energy is mc\u00b2 (rest energy).\n\nAfter the collision, we have:\n\n- The initial electron, now moving\n\n- A newly created electron\n\n- A newly created positron\n\nAll three particles are moving in the same direction as the initial photon, at equal speeds.\n\nWait, but positrons are the antiparticles of electrons, so they have the same mass m but opposite charge.\n\nNow, let's think about the energy before and after.\n\nInitial energy:\n\n- Photon: E_photon\n\n- Electron: mc\u00b2\n\nTotal initial energy: E_photon + mc\u00b2\n\nFinal energy:\n\n- Three particles, each with energy E\n\nSo, E_photon + mc\u00b2 = 3E\n\nBut we need to relate E to mc\u00b2.\n\nAlso, we need to consider momentum conservation.\n\nInitial momentum:\n\n- Photon: p_photon = E_photon / c\n\n- Electron: 0 (at rest)\n\nTotal initial momentum: E_photon / c\n\nFinal momentum:\n\n- Three particles, each with momentum p\n\nSo, E_photon / c = 3p\n\nNow, for each particle, the relation between energy and momentum is:\n\nE = sqrt(p\u00b2c\u00b2 + m\u00b2c\u2074)\n\nBut since all three particles have the same mass m and are moving at the same speed, their energies and momenta are the same.\n\nLet\u2019s denote E = energy of each particle, and p = momentum of each particle.\n\nFrom the energy-momentum relation:\n\nE = sqrt(p\u00b2c\u00b2 + m\u00b2c\u2074)\n\nBut since all particles are moving at the same speed, and have the same mass, their energies and momenta are equal.\n\nWait, but actually, for particles with mass, E = sqrt(p\u00b2c\u00b2 + m\u00b2c\u2074)\n\nBut since they are moving at the same speed, their momenta are equal, and thus their energies are equal.\n\nSo, E = sqrt(p\u00b2c\u00b2 + m\u00b2c\u2074)\n\nWe can square both sides:\n\nE\u00b2 = p\u00b2c\u00b2 + m\u00b2c\u2074\n\nWe can solve for p in terms of E:\n\np\u00b2c\u00b2 = E\u00b2 - m\u00b2c\u2074\n\np = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2c\u2074) / c\n\nBut from momentum conservation:\n\nE_photon / c = 3p\n\nAnd from energy conservation:\n\nE_photon + mc\u00b2 = 3E\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) E_photon + mc\u00b2 = 3E\n\n2) E_photon / c = 3p\n\nAnd p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2c\u2074) / c\n\nLet\u2019s plug p from equation 2 into this expression:\n\n3p = E_photon / c\n\nSo, p = E_photon / (3c)\n\nThen, p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2c\u2074) / c\n\nSo,\n\nE_photon / (3c) = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2c\u2074) / c\n\nWe can cancel c from both sides:\n\nE_photon / 3 = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2c\u2074)\n\nNow, let's square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n(E_photon / 3)\u00b2 = E\u00b2 - m\u00b2c\u2074\n\nSo,\n\nE_photon\u00b2 / 9 = E\u00b2 - m\u00b2c\u2074\n\nNow, from energy conservation, E_photon + mc\u00b2 = 3E \u21d2 E_photon = 3E - mc\u00b2\n\nLet\u2019s substitute this into the previous equation:\n\n(3E - mc\u00b2)\u00b2 / 9 = E\u00b2 - m\u00b2c\u2074\n\nExpand the left side:\n\n(9E\u00b2 - 6E mc\u00b2 + m\u00b2c\u2074) / 9 = E\u00b2 - m\u00b2c\u2074\n\nSimplify:\n\nE\u00b2 - (2/3)E mc\u00b2 + (1/9)m\u00b2c\u2074 = E\u00b2 - m\u00b2c\u2074\n\nNow, subtract E\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n- (2/3)E mc\u00b2 + (1/9)m\u00b2c\u2074 = - m\u00b2c\u2074\n\nAdd m\u00b2c\u2074 to both sides:\n\n- (2/3)E mc\u00b2 + (1/9)m\u00b2c\u2074 + m\u00b2c\u2074 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- (2/3)E mc\u00b2 + (1/9 + 9/9)m\u00b2c\u2074 = 0\n\n- (2/3)E mc\u00b2 + (10/9)m\u00b2c\u2074 = 0\n\nFactor out m c\u00b2:\n\nm c\u00b2 [ - (2/3)E / c\u00b2 + (10/9)c\u00b2 / c\u00b2 ] = 0\n\nm c\u00b2 [ - (2/3)E / c\u00b2 + (10/9)c\u00b2 ] = 0\n\nWait, that seems off. Let's be careful with the terms.\n\nActually, it's better to keep it as:\n\n- (2/3)E mc\u00b2 + (10/9)m\u00b2c\u2074 = 0\n\nWe can divide both sides by m c\u00b2:\n\n- (2/3)E + (10/9)m c\u00b2 = 0\n\nWait, no. Actually, m c\u00b2 is a common factor, but let's solve for E:\n\n- (2/3)E mc\u00b2 + (10/9)m\u00b2c\u2074 = 0\n\nFactor m c\u00b2:\n\nm c\u00b2 [ - (2/3)E + (10/9)m c\u00b2 ] = 0\n\nSince m and c\u00b2 are positive and non-zero, we can set the expression inside the brackets to zero:\n\n- (2/3)E + (10/9)m c\u00b2 = 0\n\nNow, solve for E:\n\n(2/3)E = (10/9)m c\u00b2\n\nMultiply both sides by 3/2:\n\nE = (10/9 * 3/2) m c\u00b2\n\nE = (30/18) m c\u00b2\n\nSimplify 30/18:\n\n30 \u00f7 6 = 5, 18 \u00f7 6 = 3\n\nSo, E = (5/3) m c\u00b2\n\nNow, recall from energy conservation:\n\nE_photon = 3E - mc\u00b2\n\nSubstitute E = (5/3) m c\u00b2:\n\nE_photon = 3*(5/3 m c\u00b2) - m c\u00b2 = 5 m c\u00b2 - m c\u00b2 = 4 m c\u00b2\n\nSo, the energy of the photon is 4 m c\u00b2.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. mc\u00b2\n\nB. 2mc\u00b2\n\nC. 3mc\u00b2\n\nD. 4mc\u00b2\n\nSo, the answer is D. 4mc\u00b2.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this result to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, energy conservation: E_photon + mc\u00b2 = 3E\n\nMomentum conservation: E_photon / c = 3p\n\nAnd for each particle, E = sqrt(p\u00b2c\u00b2 + m\u00b2c\u2074)\n\nWe substituted p from momentum conservation into the energy-momentum relation and solved for E, then found E_photon.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider the rest energy required to create the particles.\n\nInitially, there's one electron with energy mc\u00b2.\n\nAfter the collision, there are three particles: the initial electron and the newly created electron-positron pair.\n\nEach of the newly created particles has energy mc\u00b2, so the total rest energy after is 3 mc\u00b2.\n\nBut the initial rest energy was mc\u00b2, and the photon carried some energy E_photon.\n\nSo, E_photon + mc\u00b2 = 3 mc\u00b2 \u21d2 E_photon = 2 mc\u00b2\n\nBut this would suggest that E_photon is 2 mc\u00b2, which contradicts my earlier result of 4 mc\u00b2.\n\nHmm, there must be something wrong with this simpler approach.\n\nWait, in the initial state, the electron is at rest with energy mc\u00b2, and the photon has energy E_photon.\n\nIn the final state, there are three particles moving with kinetic energy plus their rest masses.\n\nBut in my earlier calculation, I assumed that each of the final particles has energy E, which includes their rest mass energy and kinetic energy.\n\nSo, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that the energy E is just the total energy of each particle, including rest mass energy.\n\nWait, but in special relativity, energy is always the total energy, including rest mass.\n\nSo, E = gamma m c\u00b2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.\n\nGiven that all particles are moving at the same speed, they have the same gamma.\n\nBut maybe I need to consider their kinetic energies explicitly.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLet v be the common speed of all three particles.\n\nThen, their kinetic energy is T = gamma m c\u00b2 - m c\u00b2, where gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nTheir total energy is E = gamma m c\u00b2\n\nTheir momentum is p = gamma m v\n\nFrom momentum conservation:\n\nE_photon / c = 3 p\n\nBut E_photon = h f = pc, so E_photon / c = p\n\nTherefore, p = E_photon / (3c)\n\nFrom energy conservation:\n\nE_photon + mc\u00b2 = 3 E\n\nBut E = gamma m c\u00b2\n\nSo, E_photon + mc\u00b2 = 3 gamma m c\u00b2\n\nTherefore, E_photon = 3 gamma m c\u00b2 - mc\u00b2 = (3 gamma - 1) mc\u00b2\n\nNow, from p = gamma m v / 3c = E_photon / (3c)\n\nBut p = gamma m v, so gamma m v = E_photon / 3c\n\nBut E_photon = (3 gamma - 1) mc\u00b2\n\nSo, gamma m v = (3 gamma - 1) mc\u00b2 / 3c\n\nCancel m:\n\ngamma v = (3 gamma - 1) c\u00b2 / 3c\n\nMultiply both sides by 3c:\n\n3c gamma v = (3 gamma - 1) c\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by c\u00b2:\n\n3 gamma v / c\u00b2 = 3 gamma / c - 1 / c\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the relation between energy and momentum for each particle.\n\nFor each particle:\n\nE\u00b2 = p\u00b2 c\u2074 + m\u00b2 c\u2074\n\nBut p = E_photon / (3c)\n\nSo, E\u00b2 = [E_photon / (3c)]\u00b2 c\u2074 + m\u00b2 c\u2074\n\nSimplify:\n\nE\u00b2 = [E_photon\u00b2 / 9 c\u00b2] + m\u00b2 c\u2074\n\nFrom energy conservation:\n\nE_photon + mc\u00b2 = 3E \u21d2 E_photon = 3E - mc\u00b2\n\nSubstitute into the previous equation:\n\nE\u00b2 = [(3E - mc\u00b2)\u00b2 / 9 c\u00b2] + m\u00b2 c\u2074\n\nSimplify:\n\nE\u00b2 = [(9E\u00b2 - 6E mc\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c\u2074) / 9 c\u00b2] + m\u00b2 c\u2074\n\n= (E\u00b2 / c\u00b2 - (2/3)E m / c + m\u00b2 / 9 c\u00b2) + m\u00b2 c\u2074\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's recalculate.\n\nActually, (3E - mc\u00b2)\u00b2 = 9E\u00b2 - 6E mc\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c\u2074\n\nDivide by 9:\n\n(9E\u00b2 - 6E mc\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c\u2074)/9 = E\u00b2 - (2/3)E mc\u00b2 + (1/9)m\u00b2 c\u2074\n\nThen, E\u00b2 = [E\u00b2 - (2/3)E mc\u00b2 + (1/9)m\u00b2 c\u2074]/c\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c\u2074\n\nWait, no. Let's write it properly.\n\nE\u00b2 = [E_photon\u00b2 / 9 c\u00b2] + m\u00b2 c\u2074\n\nBut E_photon = 3E - mc\u00b2\n\nSo, E_photon\u00b2 = (3E - mc\u00b2)\u00b2 = 9E\u00b2 - 6E mc\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c\u2074\n\nTherefore,\n\nE\u00b2 = [9E\u00b2 - 6E mc\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c\u2074]/(9 c\u00b2) + m\u00b2 c\u2074\n\nSimplify:\n\nE\u00b2 = [9E\u00b2 - 6E mc\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c\u2074]/(9 c\u00b2) + m\u00b2 c\u2074\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by c\u00b2:\n\nE\u00b2 = [9E\u00b2 c\u00b2 - 6E mc\u2074 + m\u00b2 c\u2074]/9 c\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c\u2074\n\nNow, add m\u00b2 c\u2074:\n\nE\u00b2 = [9E\u00b2 c\u00b2 - 6E mc\u2074 + m\u00b2 c\u2074]/9 c\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c\u2074\n\nTo combine, express m\u00b2 c\u2074 with a common denominator:\n\nE\u00b2 = [9E\u00b2 c\u00b2 - 6E mc\u2074 + m\u00b2 c\u2074 + 9 m\u00b2 c\u2074]/9 c\u00b2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n9E\u00b2 c\u00b2 - 6E mc\u2074 + 10 m\u00b2 c\u2074\n\nSo,\n\nE\u00b2 = [9E\u00b2 c\u00b2 - 6E mc\u2074 + 10 m\u00b2 c\u2074]/9 c\u00b2\n\nMultiply both sides by 9 c\u00b2:\n\n9 c\u00b2 E\u00b2 = 9E\u00b2 c\u00b2 - 6E mc\u2074 + 10 m\u00b2 c\u2074\n\nSubtract 9E\u00b2 c\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n0 = -6E mc\u2074 + 10 m\u00b2 c\u2074\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let's check the algebra again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in combining the terms.\n\nLet me go back.\n\nWe have:\n\nE\u00b2 = [9E\u00b2 c\u00b2 - 6E mc\u2074 + m\u00b2 c\u2074]/9 c\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c\u2074\n\nTo combine, express m\u00b2 c\u2074 as (9 m\u00b2 c\u2074)/9 c\u00b2:\n\nE\u00b2 = [9E\u00b2 c\u00b2 - 6E mc\u2074 + m\u00b2 c\u2074 + 9 m\u00b2 c\u2074]/9 c\u00b2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n9E\u00b2 c\u00b2 - 6E mc\u2074 + 10 m\u00b2 c\u2074\n\nSo,\n\nE\u00b2 = [9E\u00b2 c\u00b2 - 6E mc\u2074 + 10 m\u00b2 c\u2074]/9 c\u00b2\n\nMultiply both sides by 9 c\u00b2:\n\n9 c\u00b2 E\u00b2 = 9E\u00b2 c\u00b2 - 6E mc\u2074 + 10 m\u00b2 c\u2074\n\nSubtract 9E\u00b2 c\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n0 = -6E mc\u2074 + 10 m\u00b2 c\u2074\n\nThis seems problematic because it would imply that -6E mc\u2074 + 10 m\u00b2 c\u2074 = 0\n\nThen, 6E mc\u2074 = 10 m\u00b2 c\u2074\n\nDivide both sides by 2 m c\u2074:\n\n3E = 5 m c\u00b2\n\nTherefore, E = (5/3) m c\u00b2\n\nWait, but earlier I had E = (5/3) m c\u00b2, which led to E_photon = 4 m c\u00b2.\n\nBut according to this simpler approach, E_photon should be 2 m c\u00b2.\n\nThere's a contradiction here.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the particles have kinetic energy as well as rest mass energy.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nEach final particle has energy E = m c\u00b2 + T, where T is the kinetic energy.\n\nFrom energy conservation:\n\nE_photon + mc\u00b2 = 3E = 3(m c\u00b2 + T)\n\nTherefore, E_photon + mc\u00b2 = 3 m c\u00b2 + 3 T\n\nSo, E_photon = 2 m c\u00b2 + 3 T\n\nFrom momentum conservation:\n\nE_photon / c = 3 p\n\nBut p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c\u2074)/c\n\nSo, E_photon / c = 3 sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c\u2074)/c\n\nSimplify:\n\nE_photon = 3 sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c\u2074)\n\nBut from above, E_photon = 2 m c\u00b2 + 3 T\n\nSo, 2 m c\u00b2 + 3 T = 3 sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c\u2074)\n\nBut E = m c\u00b2 + T, so E_photon = 2 m c\u00b2 + 3 T = 3 (m c\u00b2 + T) - m c\u00b2 = 3 E - m c\u00b2\n\nWait, that seems circular.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express T in terms of E:\n\nT = E - m c\u00b2\n\nThen, E_photon = 2 m c\u00b2 + 3 T = 2 m c\u00b2 + 3 (E - m c\u00b2) = 2 m c\u00b2 + 3 E - 3 m c\u00b2 = 3 E - m c\u00b2\n\nBut from energy conservation, E_photon + mc\u00b2 = 3 E \u21d2 E_photon = 3 E - m c\u00b2\n\nSo, 3 E - m c\u00b2 = 3 E - m c\u00b2, which is consistent.\n\nBut this doesn't help me find E_photon.\n\nPerhaps I need to relate E and p.\n\nFrom E = sqrt(p\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c\u2074)\n\nAnd p = E_photon / (3 c)\n\nBut E_photon = 3 E - m c\u00b2\n\nSo, p = (3 E - m c\u00b2)/3 c = (E - m c\u00b2)/c\n\nBut E - m c\u00b2 = T, the kinetic energy.\n\nSo, p = T / c\n\nBut T = sqrt(p\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c\u2074) - m c\u00b2\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the relation for relativistic particles:\n\nE = gamma m c\u00b2\n\np = gamma m v\n\nAnd gamma = 1 / sqrt(1"
