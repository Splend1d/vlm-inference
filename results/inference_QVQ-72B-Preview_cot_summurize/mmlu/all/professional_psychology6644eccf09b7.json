Exposure to a nonaggressive model\n\nB. Opportunities for catharsis\n\nC. Social skills training\n\nD. A threat of retaliation from a high-status person\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to think about each option and see which one isn't really going to help reduce aggression in kids.\n\nFirst up, option A: exposure to a nonaggressive model. I remember from psychology classes that modeling is a big deal in learning behavior. If kids see someone acting nonaggressively, maybe they'll imitate that behavior. So, this seems like it could be effective. But is it the least effective? Probably not.\n\nOption B: opportunities for catharsis. Catharsis is like letting out emotions or energy, right? Maybe letting kids express their aggression in a safe way, like punching a pillow or something. Some people think that if you let kids get their aggression out in a controlled environment, they'll be less aggressive overall. But actually, research suggests that catharsis can sometimes backfire and increase aggression. So, maybe this isn't the best strategy.\n\nOption C: social skills training. This sounds straightforward. Teaching kids how to interact with others, resolve conflicts peacefully, and communicate effectively. This seems really helpful for reducing aggression because it gives them tools to handle situations without resorting to aggression. So, this should be effective.\n\nOption D: a threat of retaliation from a high-status person. This one is interesting. If a teacher or parent says, \"If you're aggressive, there will be consequences,\" that's a form of punishment. Punishment can sometimes suppress aggressive behavior in the short term, but it doesn't necessarily teach alternative behaviors or address the underlying causes of aggression. In fact, if not done correctly, it could lead to increased aggression or other problems.\n\nSo, comparing all these options:\n\n- Modeling nonaggressive behavior (A) is likely to be effective.\n\n- Catharsis (B) might actually increase aggression in some cases.\n\n- Social skills training (C) is likely to be very effective.\n\n- Threat of retaliation (D) might suppress aggression temporarily but isn't as effective in the long run and could have negative side effects.\n\nGiven that, I think option B, opportunities for catharsis, is probably the least effective strategy for reducing aggressiveness in children. Not only is it not likely to reduce aggression, but it might even make things worse.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's some research that shows catharsis can be effective under certain conditions. Hmm.\n\nI recall that the idea of catharsis as a way to reduce aggression has been challenged by research. Some studies suggest that expressing aggression can actually increase aggressive thoughts and behaviors. So, yeah, it seems like providing opportunities for catharsis isn't a reliable way to reduce aggression in children.\n\nOn the other hand, exposure to nonaggressive models can help children learn alternative behaviors, social skills training can equip them with tools to manage conflicts, and threats of retaliation might deter aggression out of fear of consequences, though it might not address the root causes.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option B seems to be the least effective strategy for reducing aggressiveness in children.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
