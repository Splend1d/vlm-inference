                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the government is increasing both spending and taxes by the same amount to keep a balanced budget. The MPC, or marginal propensity to consume, is given as 0.75. We need to figure out which of the provided options correctly describes the policy direction and the multipliers for expenditure and taxes.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a balanced budget multiplier is. The balanced budget multiplier refers to the effect on aggregate demand when the government increases both spending and taxes by the same amount. The key idea here is to see whether this action expands or contracts the economy, and by how much.\n\nLet's recall that the expenditure multiplier measures how much the total output (GDP) changes in response to a change in government spending. Similarly, the tax multiplier shows how much the total output changes in response to a change in taxes.\n\nGiven that MPC is 0.75, we can find the marginal propensity to save (MPS), which is 1 - MPC. So, MPS = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25.\n\nNow, the formula for the expenditure multiplier is 1 / MPS. Plugging in the numbers:\n\nExpenditure multiplier = 1 / 0.25 = 4.\n\nOkay, so the expenditure multiplier is 4.\n\nNext, the tax multiplier. The formula for the tax multiplier is -MPC / MPS.\n\nTax multiplier = -0.75 / 0.25 = -3.\n\nSo, the tax multiplier is -3.\n\nNow, in this scenario, the government increases both spending and taxes by the same amount. Since both changes are in the same direction and by the same amount, we need to see the net effect.\n\nThe balanced budget multiplier suggests that when government spending and taxes are increased by the same amount, the net effect on GDP is equal to the increase in government spending multiplied by the expenditure multiplier.\n\nWait a minute, but the tax multiplier is negative, meaning that an increase in taxes leads to a decrease in GDP. So, if both spending and taxes are increased, the effect on GDP would be the increase in spending times the expenditure multiplier plus the increase in taxes times the tax multiplier.\n\nLet's denote the increase in spending and taxes as \u0394G = \u0394T.\n\nThen, the change in GDP (\u0394Y) would be:\n\n\u0394Y = \u0394G * expenditure multiplier + \u0394T * tax multiplier.\n\nGiven that \u0394G = \u0394T, this becomes:\n\n\u0394Y = \u0394G * 4 + \u0394G * (-3) = \u0394G * (4 - 3) = \u0394G * 1.\n\nSo, the net effect is an increase in GDP equal to the increase in government spending, which suggests that the policy is expansionary.\n\nWait, but in a balanced budget scenario, you're increasing taxes by the same amount as spending, which might seem neutral, but according to this calculation, it's still expansionary.\n\nLet me double-check this.\n\nIf the government spends an extra dollar and taxes an extra dollar, the spending increases GDP by $4, but the tax increase decreases GDP by $3. So, net increase is $1 in GDP, which aligns with the balanced budget multiplier concept.\n\nTherefore, the policy direction is expansionary, with an expenditure multiplier of 4 and a tax multiplier of -3.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. expansionary 4 -3\n\nB. expansionary 4 3\n\nC. contractionary 4 3\n\nD. contractionary 4 -3\n\nSo, option A seems correct: expansionary, expenditure multiplier 4, tax multiplier -3.\n\nBut let's make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nIs there a possibility that the policy could be contractionary? If MPC were less than 0.5, sometimes policies could have counterintuitive effects, but here MPC is 0.75, which is greater than 0.5, so the multipliers should work as expected.\n\nAlso, the balanced budget multiplier theory suggests that in a simple model, increasing government spending and taxes by the same amount leads to an increase in GDP equal to the increase in spending, which is indeed expansionary.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A: expansionary, expenditure multiplier 4, tax multiplier -3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
