                    "text": "So I have this problem about a grating spectrometer and resolving power. It says that the spectrometer can just barely resolve two wavelengths: 500 nanometers and 502 nanometers. And I need to find the resolving power of the spectrometer. The options are 2, 250, 5000, and 10,000.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what resolving power is. I think resolving power is a measure of how well a spectrometer can distinguish between two similar wavelengths. So, if it can just barely resolve 500 nm and 502 nm, that means these two wavelengths are at the limit of what the spectrometer can separate.\n\nThere's a formula for resolving power that I should remember. I think it's generally defined as the wavelength divided by the change in wavelength that can be distinguished. So, resolving power R is given by R = \u03bb / \u0394\u03bb, where \u03bb is the wavelength and \u0394\u03bb is the difference between the two wavelengths.\n\nGiven that, I have \u03bb = 500 nm and \u0394\u03bb = 502 nm - 500 nm = 2 nm. So, R = 500 / 2 = 250.\n\nWait, but one of the options is 2, which would be if I mistakenly used \u0394\u03bb as 502 nm, but that doesn't make sense. So, 250 seems correct.\n\nBut let's double-check. Resolving power is indeed \u03bb / \u0394\u03bb, and in this case, \u03bb is 500 nm and \u0394\u03bb is 2 nm, so R = 500 / 2 = 250. That seems straightforward.\n\nHowever, I recall that in some contexts, especially with gratings, the resolving power can be related to the order of the spectrum and the number of lines on the grating. The formula is sometimes given as R = n * N, where n is the order and N is the total number of lines in the grating.\n\nBut in this problem, there's no mention of the order or the number of lines, so I think the simpler definition of resolving power as \u03bb / \u0394\u03bb is applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes resolving power is defined in terms of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the spectral lines, but again, with the information given, the simple ratio seems appropriate.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor that could affect the resolving power. For example, the slit width, the width of the grating, or the numerical aperture of the optics involved. But none of that is mentioned in the problem, so I think we can assume that the resolving power is simply \u03bb / \u0394\u03bb.\n\nTherefore, the resolving power is 500 / 2 = 250.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. 250.\n\nWait a minute, but option A is 2, which might be a trap for someone who mistakenly uses \u0394\u03bb as 502 nm, but since \u0394\u03bb is correctly calculated as 2 nm, that can't be.\n\nOption C is 5000, which might come from misusing the formula, perhaps thinking R = \u03bb + \u0394\u03bb or something, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nOption D is 10,000, which might be if someone uses R = \u03bb / (\u0394\u03bb / 2), but that also doesn't seem right.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. 250.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret \"just barely resolve.\" Maybe it's referring to the Rayleigh criterion or some other criterion for resolution. But regardless of the specific criterion, the formula for resolving power in spectroscopy is generally \u03bb / \u0394\u03bb.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 250.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
