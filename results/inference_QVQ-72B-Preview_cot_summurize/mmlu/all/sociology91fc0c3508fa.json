                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about inter-generational mobility. It's asking what the term refers to, and there are four options. Let me read them again to make sure I understand.\n\nOption A says it's \"movement into a different occupational category over a person's lifetime.\" Hmm, that sounds more like intra-generational mobility, doesn't it? Like, if someone changes jobs or careers during their own life, that's more about them moving within their own generation, right?\n\nOption B is \"movement into different occupational categories between generations.\" This seems more accurate for inter-generational mobility. So, it's about parents and children, or grandparents and grandchildren, moving into different occupational categories compared to each other.\n\nOption C is \"movement into a higher occupational category.\" This sounds like upward mobility, but inter-generational mobility can be upward or downward. So, this might be too narrow.\n\nOption D is \"movement into an occupation that generates a lower income.\" This seems like downward mobility, again, which is a part of inter-generational mobility, but it's not the whole picture. Inter-generational mobility can go both ways.\n\nSo, based on this, I think option B is the best answer. It captures the essence of inter-generational mobility by emphasizing the movement between different occupational categories across generations.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me think about it differently. Inter-generational mobility is about the transmission of social status or occupation from one generation to the next. So, if a parent is a doctor and their child becomes a teacher, that's a change in occupational category between generations. Similarly, if a parent is a factory worker and their child becomes an engineer, that's another example.\n\nOption A, on the other hand, is more about individual career changes within a person's life span, which is intra-generational. So, if someone starts as a teacher and later becomes a lawyer, that's a change within their own lifetime, not between generations.\n\nOption C and D seem to focus only on the direction of mobility\u2014upward or downward\u2014but inter-generational mobility is more about the change in occupational status between generations, regardless of the direction.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option B is the correct choice.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if inter-generational mobility only refers to movement into different occupational categories, or if it can also refer to staying in the same category. I think, in sociology, inter-generational mobility includes both cases where there is movement into different categories and where there is no change, but the term \"mobility\" generally implies movement or change.\n\nSo, in that case, option B is still the most accurate because it captures the idea of moving into different occupational categories between generations.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll look up the definition of inter-generational mobility.\n\nOkay, according to sociology textbooks, inter-generational mobility is the movement of individuals or groups from one social position to another over time, typically comparing the social positions of parents and their children. So, it involves comparing the occupational statuses across generations.\n\nThis aligns perfectly with option B: movement into different occupational categories between generations.\n\nI don't think it's necessary to include the possibility of no change, because that would be inter-generational stability, not mobility. So, the term mobility implies change.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
