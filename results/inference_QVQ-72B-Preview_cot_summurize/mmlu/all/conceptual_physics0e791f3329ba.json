                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: I need to find out how much power is required to raise a 100-kilogram crate a vertical distance of 2 meters in 4 seconds. The options are 200 watts, 500 watts, 800 watts, and 2000 watts. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that power is basically the amount of work done divided by the time it takes to do that work. So, power equals work divided by time, right? That makes sense. So, in formula terms, it's P = W / t.\n\nNow, I need to find the work done in raising this crate. Work is force times distance, right? So, W = F * d. But here, the force should be in the direction of the displacement, and since it's being raised vertically, the force is just the weight of the crate.\n\nWait, but is there any acceleration involved? Like, is the crate being accelerated upwards, or is it being raised at a constant speed? The problem doesn't specify, so maybe I should assume it's being raised at a constant speed for simplicity's sake. That means there's no acceleration, just the force needed to overcome gravity.\n\nSo, if it's being raised at a constant speed, the force required is just the weight of the crate, which is the mass times gravity. So, F = m * g, where m is 100 kg and g is approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2.\n\nLet me calculate that: 100 kg * 9.81 m/s\u00b2 = 981 N. So, the force needed is 981 newtons.\n\nNow, the distance it's being raised is 2 meters vertically. Since the force and the displacement are in the same direction, I can just multiply force by distance to get the work done.\n\nSo, W = F * d = 981 N * 2 m = 1962 joules.\n\nNow, time is 4 seconds, so power P = W / t = 1962 J / 4 s = 490.5 watts.\n\nHmm, but looking back at the options, none of them match exactly. The closest is 500 watts, which is option B. Maybe it's just rounded off.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should check my calculations again. Let's see:\n\nForce F = m * g = 100 kg * 9.81 m/s\u00b2 = 981 N\n\nWork W = F * d = 981 N * 2 m = 1962 J\n\nPower P = W / t = 1962 J / 4 s = 490.5 W\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the power required is approximately 490.5 watts, which rounds to 500 watts. Therefore, the answer should be B. 500 W.\n\nBut let's think again. Is there any other factor I should consider? For example, if there's any mechanical advantage or efficiency involved in raising the crate, but the problem doesn't mention any of that. It seems like a straightforward calculation of power based on work done against gravity over time.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the formula for power in relation to force and velocity. Power can also be P = F * v, where v is the velocity. If it's being raised 2 meters in 4 seconds at a constant speed, then v = 2 m / 4 s = 0.5 m/s.\n\nSo, P = F * v = 981 N * 0.5 m/s = 490.5 W, which matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, since it's against gravity, I could think in terms of potential energy. The change in gravitational potential energy is m * g * h, where h is the height difference.\n\nSo, \u0394PE = 100 kg * 9.81 m/s\u00b2 * 2 m = 1962 J, which again is the same as the work done.\n\nPower is then \u0394PE / t = 1962 J / 4 s = 490.5 W.\n\nYeah, no matter how I look at it, I keep arriving at the same answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider significant figures. The masses and distances given have three significant figures, but time has one significant figure. However, since the problem gives time as 4 seconds, which can be considered as 4.0 seconds for the purpose of significant figures, I can treat all values to two decimal places.\n\nSo, 100 kg * 9.81 m/s\u00b2 * 2 m / 4 s = 490.5 W, which, when rounded to one significant figure, becomes 500 W.\n\nTherefore, the closest correct option is B. 500 W.\n\nI think that's solid reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 500 \\ W} \\]"
