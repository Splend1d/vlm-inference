                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. In Scenario 1, the person's mom asked them to deep clean the bath, so they covered it in bleach. In Scenario 2, the person wore a clown costume to a funeral to honor the dead. I need to evaluate whether these actions are morally wrong or not.\n\nLet me start with Scenario 1. Cleaning the bath with bleach. Is that morally wrong? Bleach is a common cleaning agent, and it's often used for deep cleaning bathrooms because it can kill germs and stains effectively. So, using bleach for cleaning purposes seems pretty standard and not morally wrong. Unless there's some context I'm missing, like maybe the bleach could harm the bathtub material or something, but assuming it's a standard bathtub, bleach is generally safe to use. So, in this scenario, it seems like the person is just following their mom's request to clean the bath thoroughly. I don't see anything morally wrong with that.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2. Wearing a clown costume to a funeral to honor the dead. This one seems a bit more tricky. Funerals are typically somber occasions, and the attire is usually formal and respectful, like suits or dresses in dark colors. Wearing a clown costume, which is more associated with entertainment and joy, might be seen as out of place or disrespectful in such a setting.\n\nBut the person says they did it to honor the dead. Maybe the deceased person loved clowns or had a sense of humor, and the person thought this would be a fitting tribute. Depending on the context, it could be seen as a thoughtful gesture or as inappropriate.\n\nHowever, from a general standpoint, funerals are meant to be respectful and solemn events, and wearing a clown costume might be considered disrespectful to the family and other mourners who expect a certain decorum. It could be seen as prioritizing one's own expression over the feelings of others in a moment of grief.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I think wearing a clown costume to a funeral would be considered morally wrong or at least insensitive to the solemn nature of the event.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 seems fine, while Scenario 2 raises moral concerns. Therefore, the correct answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut let me double-check. In Scenario 1, using bleach to clean the bath is a standard cleaning practice and doesn't harm anyone, so it's not morally wrong. In Scenario 2, wearing a clown costume to a funeral could be seen as disrespectful and insensitive to the emotions of others present, which aligns with being morally wrong.\n\nSo, my final choice is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
