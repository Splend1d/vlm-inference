                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out whether the trial court is likely to grant the suppression motion for the cocaine that was found in the car. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the officer stopped the driver for speeding and then found out that her license was suspended. Because of that, he arrested her for driving while under suspension. That seems straightforward. Then, he put her in the back seat of the squad car and searched her car, finding several bags of cocaine inside a coat on the rear seat. Based on that, he arrested her for possession and possession with intent to deliver cocaine.\n\nNow, before trial, the driver is moving to suppress the cocaine. So, the question is, is it likely that the trial court will grant that motion?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Yes, it must be suppressed because this was an unreasonable, warrantless search.\n\nB. No, the motion will be denied because the search was permissible as incident to a proper arrest.\n\nC. No, the motion will be denied because the initial traffic stop was legal and everything that flowed therefrom was a reasonable step to search for crime.\n\nD. Yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.\n\nOkay, so I need to understand which of these is correct.\n\nFirst, let's consider the legality of the initial stop and arrest. The officer stopped the driver for speeding, which is a valid reason for a traffic stop. During the stop, he discovered that her license was suspended, which is a separate offense. He arrested her for driving while under suspension, which seems proper.\n\nNow, after the arrest, he searched the car and found cocaine. The question is whether this search was lawful.\n\nI recall that there's a doctrine called \"search incident to arrest\" which allows officers to search certain areas without a warrant when they arrest someone. But there are limits to this.\n\nLet me think about the Supreme Court cases related to this. I think there was a case called Arizona v. Gant (2009) that set some limits on vehicle searches incident to arrest.\n\nIn Gant, the Court held that police may search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant's arrest only if:\n\n1. The arrestee is within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search, or\n\n2. The police have reasonable belief that evidence relevant to the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle.\n\nIn this scenario, the driver was secured in the back seat of the squad car, so she wasn't within reaching distance of the passenger compartment of her own car. So, the first condition isn't met.\n\nAs for the second condition, the officer would need to have a reasonable belief that evidence related to the crime of arrest (driving while under suspension) would be found in the car. I'm not sure if that's the case here. Driving while under suspension doesn't necessarily involve any physical evidence that would be in the car.\n\nSo, based on Gant, it seems like the search might not be justified as incident to arrest.\n\nBut option B says no, the motion will be denied because the search was permissible as incident to a proper arrest. Given what I just thought about Gant, that seems contrary.\n\nOption A says yes, it must be suppressed because it was an unreasonable, warrantless search. That seems in line with Gant, but I need to make sure.\n\nOption C says no, the motion will be denied because the initial traffic stop was legal and everything that flowed therefrom was a reasonable step to search for crime. But that seems too broad. Just because the initial stop was legal doesn't mean that everything that follows is automatically reasonable. There have to be specific justifications for each action.\n\nOption D says yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.\n\nI know that generally, vehicles can be searched without a warrant if there's probable cause to believe they contain evidence of a crime, due to the mobility of vehicles and the potential for evidence to be destroyed or moved quickly. This is known as the automobile exception.\n\nHowever, Gant seems to put some limits on that, especially in the context of searches incident to arrest.\n\nWait, but the automobile exception allows warrantless searches based on probable cause, separate from the search incident to arrest doctrine.\n\nMaybe the officer had probable cause to believe there was evidence of a crime in the car, unrelated to the arrest for driving while under suspension.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't specify any probable cause for believing there was cocaine in the car.\n\nSo, perhaps the search was based solely on the arrest, assuming that the car could be searched as incident to the arrest.\n\nBut, as per Gant, that might not be sufficient if the arrestee isn't within reaching distance and there's no reasonable belief that evidence related to the crime of arrest is in the car.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the officer had reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe there was contraband in the car, which would allow a search under the automobile exception.\n\nBut again, the scenario doesn't provide any information to suggest that the officer had such suspicion.\n\nSo, perhaps the search was unlawful, and the cocaine should be suppressed.\n\nBut I need to consider other possibilities.\n\nMaybe the officer searched the car for officer safety or inventory purposes, but the scenario doesn't mention that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coat on the rear seat was in plain view, and the officer saw something suspicious about it, which gave him probable cause to search it.\n\nBut again, the scenario doesn't specify that.\n\nSo, based on the information given, it seems like the search was conducted solely because of the arrest, assuming that the car could be searched as incident to arrest.\n\nGiven that, and considering the limitations set by Gant, it seems like the search might be invalid, and therefore, the cocaine should be suppressed.\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any other doctrine that might allow the search without a warrant in this situation?\n\nWell, there's the plain view doctrine, but that requires the officer to be lawfully present and to see something incriminating without any additional searching.\n\nIn this case, the officer found the cocaine inside a coat on the rear seat. It's not clear if the cocaine was in plain view or if the officer had to open the coat to find it.\n\nIf the cocaine was in plain view, then perhaps the plain view doctrine applies, and the search is valid.\n\nBut if the officer had to open the coat to find the cocaine, then it's not in plain view, and the search might be invalid.\n\nHowever, the scenario says the officer found several bags of cocaine \"inside a coat that was setting on the rear seat.\" It doesn't specify whether the cocaine was visible or whether the officer had to open the coat to find it.\n\nSo, it's ambiguous.\n\nIf the cocaine was inside the coat, and the officer had to open the coat to find it, then it wasn't in plain view, and the search would require a warrant or another exception to the warrant requirement.\n\nOn the other hand, if the coat was open, and the bags of cocaine were visible inside, then the plain view doctrine might apply.\n\nGiven that, and since the scenario doesn't specify, perhaps I should assume that the officer had to open the coat to find the cocaine, making it not in plain view.\n\nTherefore, the search would not be justified under the plain view doctrine.\n\nSo, going back to the search incident to arrest, and considering Gant, it seems like the search was invalid, and the cocaine should be suppressed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Yes, it must be suppressed because this was an unreasonable, warrantless search.\n\nBut wait, option D also says yes, but for a different reason: that a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.\n\nWell, actually, the automobile exception allows warrantless searches of vehicles based on probable cause, without requiring exigent circumstances.\n\nSo, option D is not entirely accurate.\n\nThe automobile exception allows warrantless searches based on probable cause, whereas exigent circumstances are a separate exception that might apply in different situations.\n\nSo, option D is misleading because it suggests that a warrant is always required unless there are exigent circumstances, which isn't the case for vehicle searches under the automobile exception.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct choice.\n\nSo, the trial court is likely to grant the suppression motion because the search was unreasonable and warrantless, without a valid exception applying.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
