                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"The positive square root of 200 is what percent larger than the positive square root of 121?\" And I need to express my answer to the nearest whole number. The options are A. 29, B. 14, C. 27, and D. 11.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to find the positive square roots of 200 and 121. I know that the positive square root of 121 is 11 because 11 times 11 is 121. But what about the square root of 200? Hmm, I don't know that off the top of my head. Maybe I can simplify it.\n\nLet me see: 200 can be written as 100 times 2, so the square root of 200 is the same as the square root of 100 times the square root of 2, which is 10\u221a2. So, \u221a200 = 10\u221a2.\n\nNow, I need to find out how much larger 10\u221a2 is than 11, in terms of percentage. To find out how much larger one number is than another in percentage terms, I can use the formula:\n\n[(larger number - smaller number) / smaller number] * 100%\n\nSo, in this case, the larger number is 10\u221a2 and the smaller number is 11.\n\nPlugging into the formula: [(10\u221a2 - 11) / 11] * 100%\n\nBut, I need to calculate the value of 10\u221a2 first. I remember that \u221a2 is approximately 1.4142, so 10 times that would be about 14.142.\n\nSo, 10\u221a2 \u2248 14.142\n\nNow, subtract 11 from that: 14.142 - 11 = 3.142\n\nThen, divide that by 11: 3.142 / 11 \u2248 0.2856\n\nFinally, multiply by 100% to get the percentage: 0.2856 * 100% \u2248 28.56%\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, that would be 29%.\n\nLooking back at the options, A. 29 seems to be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I found that \u221a200 = 10\u221a2. That seems correct.\n\nThen, \u221a2 is approximately 1.4142, so 10\u221a2 is about 14.142. That also seems right.\n\nSubtracting 11 gives 3.142.\n\nDividing by 11: 3.142 / 11 = 0.2856\n\nMultiplying by 100% gives 28.56%, which rounds to 29%.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider using a calculator to get more precise values, but since I'm estimating, this should be close enough.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. 29.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 29} \\]"
