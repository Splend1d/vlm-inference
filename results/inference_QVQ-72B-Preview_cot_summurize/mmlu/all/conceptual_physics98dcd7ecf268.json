                    "text": "Let's see. I have this physics problem here. It says that when an increase in speed doubles the momentum of a moving body, I need to find out what happens to its kinetic energy. The options are: A. Increases but less than doubles, B. Doubles, C. More than doubles, or D. Depends on factors not stated.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall the relationships between momentum, speed, mass, and kinetic energy.\n\nI know that momentum (p) is defined as mass (m) times velocity (v), so p = mv.\n\nKinetic energy (KE) is (1/2)mv\u00b2.\n\nSo, if the momentum doubles, that means mv becomes 2mv.\n\nI need to find out how KE changes as a result.\n\nLet me assume that the mass remains constant. Is that a safe assumption? The problem doesn't specify any change in mass, so I'll proceed with that.\n\nIf mass is constant and momentum doubles, then since p = mv, doubling p means v doubles.\n\nSo, if v doubles, what happens to KE?\n\nKE is proportional to v\u00b2, so if v doubles, KE becomes four times the original KE.\n\nWait, but that would mean KE more than doubles; it quadruples.\n\nBut option C says \"more than doubles,\" which could imply anything greater than doubling, but not necessarily quadrupling.\n\nSo, if KE becomes four times larger, that's definitely more than doubling.\n\nBut let's check the math carefully.\n\nInitial KE: (1/2)mv\u00b2.\n\nIf v doubles, KE becomes (1/2)m(2v)\u00b2 = (1/2)m(4v\u00b2) = 2mv\u00b2.\n\nWait, that's 2mv\u00b2, which is double the initial KE.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that it should be four times larger.\n\nHmm, I must have made a mistake.\n\nLet me recast this.\n\nInitial KE: (1/2)mv\u00b2.\n\nIf v doubles, KE becomes (1/2)m(2v)\u00b2 = (1/2)m(4v\u00b2) = 2mv\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, that's not right.\n\nWait, (1/2)m(4v\u00b2) = 2*(1/2)mv\u00b2 = 2*initial KE.\n\nWait, that's double the initial KE.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because I thought KE should be proportional to v\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me denote initial velocity as v, and final velocity as 2v.\n\nThen, initial KE: (1/2)mv\u00b2.\n\nFinal KE: (1/2)m(2v)\u00b2 = (1/2)m(4v\u00b2) = 4*(1/2)mv\u00b2 = 4 times initial KE.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was double, but now it's showing quadruple.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nAh, I see my mistake.\n\nIf momentum doubles, and p = mv, then v doubles, as I said.\n\nBut KE is (1/2)mv\u00b2, so if v doubles, KE becomes (1/2)m(2v)\u00b2 = (1/2)m(4v\u00b2) = 4*(1/2)mv\u00b2 = 4 times initial KE.\n\nSo, KE quadruples.\n\nBut in my earlier step, I mistakenly wrote (1/2)m(2v)\u00b2 = 2mv\u00b2, which is incorrect.\n\nIt should be (1/2)m(4v\u00b2) = 2*(1/2)mv\u00b2 = 4 times initial KE.\n\nSo, KE becomes four times larger, which is more than doubling.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. more than doubles.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"when an increase in speed doubles the momentum of a moving body its kinetic energy...\"\n\nBut actually, in this scenario, KE quadruples, which is more than doubling, but it's a specific factor.\n\nIs there a possibility that the mass changes? The problem says \"a moving body,\" and doesn't specify constant mass, but typically in such problems, mass is considered constant unless specified otherwise.\n\nAssuming mass is constant, then KE quadruples when momentum doubles due to speed increase.\n\nSo, KE more than doubles, which is option C.\n\nBut perhaps there's more to it.\n\nLet me consider the general case.\n\nLet the initial velocity be v, and final velocity be v', such that initial p = mv, final p = m v' = 2mv.\n\nSo, v' = 2v.\n\nThen, initial KE = (1/2)mv\u00b2.\n\nFinal KE = (1/2)m(2v)\u00b2 = (1/2)m(4v\u00b2) = 2mv\u00b2 = 4*(1/2)mv\u00b2 = 4 times initial KE.\n\nSo, KE becomes four times larger, which is indeed more than doubling.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. more than doubles.\n\nBut let's see if there's any scenario where mass changes.\n\nIf mass changes, then the relationship might be different.\n\nBut the problem states \"a moving body,\" and doesn't specify any change in mass, so it's safe to assume mass remains constant.\n\nHence, the answer is C. more than doubles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
