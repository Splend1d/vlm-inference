While new members were pledging the fraternity, the student had a reputation for initiating pranks and hazing the pledges. Late one night, after a fraternity party, the student decided to kidnap one of the pledges. Enlisting the help of his friend, they grabbed the pledge, tied him up, and locked him in the trunk of the student's car. They then drove into the downtown section of a city where they dropped the pledge at a street corner. While the pledge was wandering around and trying to find a telephone booth, a gang of youths saw his predicament and attacked him. The pledge, who was severely beaten, suffered a broken nose, multiple lacerations, and contusions. When the pledge finally returned to the school, he filed a criminal complaint against the student who was charged with violating a state law, which provides:\"Every person who hazes a student and thereby is responsible for causing bodily harm to said student is guilty of a felony punishable by three years in prison. \"At thai, the prosecuting attorney called the student's alleged accomplice as a witness. The friend refused to answer any questions and was cited for contempt. After the friend left the witness stand, the prosecutor offered into evidence a transcript of the friend's testimony given at the student's preliminary hearing. At the preliminary hearing, the friend testified under oath that he and the student were responsible for hazing the pledge and driving the victim against his will to the city. During the preliminary hearing, the friend was also cross-examined by the student's defense counsel. Over defense objections, the trial court admitted the transcript of the friend's testimony at the preliminary hearing. Thereafter, the student was convicted of violating the aforementioned hazing statute. The student appeals the conviction and contends that the admission of the transcript of the friend's testimony at the preliminary hearing violated his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. As to this claim, the student's appeal will most likely be\n\nA. granted, because there was no opportunity to cross-examine the witness at trial.\nB. granted, because in order to admit prior testimony, the witness must be shown to be unavailable.\nC. denied, because the witness was unavailable, and there was adequate opportunity for crossexamination at the preliminary hearing.\nD. denied, because the testimony was a statement by a co-conspirator and, therefore, admissible as a recognized exception to the hearsay rule.\n"

                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this case about a student who was convicted of hazing and is now appealing his conviction based on the admission of his friend's testimony from the preliminary hearing. The issue is whether this violates his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause says. It guarantees the right of a defendant in a criminal prosecution to be confronted with the witnesses against them. This means the defendant has the right to cross-examine the witnesses who testify against them.\n\nIn this case, the student's friend, who was allegedly an accomplice in the hazing incident, refused to testify at trial and was cited for contempt. Instead, the prosecution introduced a transcript of the friend's testimony from the preliminary hearing.\n\nNow, I need to think about whether this is allowed under the Confrontation Clause. Generally, prior testimony of a witness who is unavailable can be admitted if the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness.\n\nSo, the key questions are: Was the witness unavailable at trial? And did the defendant have an adequate opportunity to cross-examine the witness at the preliminary hearing?\n\nLet me consider each question.\n\nFirst, was the witness unavailable at trial? The friend refused to answer any questions and was cited for contempt, which suggests that he was unwilling to testify. Under the rules of evidence, a witness is considered unavailable if they refuse to testify despite a court order or other legal compulsion. Since he was cited for contempt, which is a sanction for disobeying a court order, it's likely that the court found him to be unavailable.\n\nSecond, did the defendant have an adequate opportunity to cross-examine the witness at the preliminary hearing? The problem states that during the preliminary hearing, the friend was cross-examined by the student's defense counsel. So, it seems that the defendant did have an opportunity to cross-examine the witness at that time.\n\nGiven these points, it appears that the admission of the preliminary hearing transcript was proper under the Confrontation Clause. The witness was unavailable, and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other angle here. Is there any chance that the cross-examination at the preliminary hearing wasn't sufficient for the purposes of the trial?\n\nWell, generally, cross-examination at a preliminary hearing is considered adequate for Confrontation Clause purposes, as long as the examination was thorough and covered the same issues that would be relevant at trial.\n\nAlso, another consideration is whether the statements being admitted are actually testimonial in nature. The Supreme Court has held that the Confrontation Clause applies to testimonial statements, which are statements made under circumstances that would lead an objective witness to believe that their statements might be used against the defendant in a future prosecution.\n\nIn this case, the friend's testimony at the preliminary hearing was given under oath, with the knowledge that it could be used in the trial. So, it seems testimonial.\n\nAdditionally, there's an exception for statements by co-conspirators made during the course of the conspiracy. However, that's a separate hearsay exception and doesn't directly relate to the Confrontation Clause issue here.\n\nGiven all this, it seems that the student's appeal is most likely to be denied because the witness was unavailable, and the defendant had an adequate opportunity to cross-examine the witness at the preliminary hearing.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Granted, because there was no opportunity to cross-examine the witness at trial.\n\nBut in this case, the defendant did have an opportunity to cross-examine the witness at the preliminary hearing.\n\nB. Granted, because in order to admit prior testimony, the witness must be shown to be unavailable.\n\nWell, the witness was unavailable, as evidenced by the citation for contempt.\n\nC. Denied, because the witness was unavailable, and there was adequate opportunity for cross-examination at the preliminary hearing.\n\nThis seems to align with my understanding.\n\nD. Denied, because the testimony was a statement by a co-conspirator and, therefore, admissible as a recognized exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nWhile the co-conspirator exception might apply, the main issue here is the Confrontation Clause, not the hearsay rule. The co-conspirator exception is about admissibility under the rules of evidence, but the Confrontation Clause is a constitutional right.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is C. Denied, because the witness was unavailable, and there was adequate opportunity for cross-examination at the preliminary hearing.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other factor that might affect this, like the reliability of the preliminary hearing transcript or whether the cross-examination was sufficient. But based on the information provided, it seems that the cross-examination did occur, and the transcript was admitted over defense objections.\n\nTherefore, the appeal is most likely to be denied on this ground.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
