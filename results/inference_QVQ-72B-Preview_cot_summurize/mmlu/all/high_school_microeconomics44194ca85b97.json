                    "text": "So I have this question here about capitalist market economies. It's asking for a typical characteristic, and there are four options. Let me read them again to make sure I understand.\n\nOption A says \"government ownership of land and capital.\" Hmm, that sounds more like a feature of a socialist or communist economy, where the government owns the means of production. In a capitalist economy, it's usually private individuals or companies that own land and capital, right? So, maybe A isn't the best choice.\n\nOption B is \"extensive price controls.\" In a market economy, prices are supposed to be determined by supply and demand. If there are extensive price controls, that sounds more like a command economy where the government sets prices. So, again, that doesn't seem to fit a capitalist market economy.\n\nOption C says \"centralized government decision making to determine production limits.\" That also sounds like a command economy, where the government plans and dictates what is produced and how much. In a capitalist market economy, production decisions are typically made by private businesses based on market demand.\n\nThat leaves option D: \"private ownership of economic resources.\" This seems to align with what I know about capitalist economies. Private individuals and companies own businesses, land, and other resources, and they operate in a competitive market environment.\n\nLet me double-check. Capitalist market economies are characterized by private property rights, free markets, and minimal government intervention. So, government ownership (A) is out, as is extensive price controls (B), and centralized government decision making (C). Private ownership of resources (D) is consistent with these characteristics.\n\nI think the correct answer is D. Private ownership of economic resources.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
