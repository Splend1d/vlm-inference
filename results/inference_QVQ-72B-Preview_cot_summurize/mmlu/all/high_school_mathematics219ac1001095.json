                    "text": "So I need to find the smallest positive integer that has 16, 15, and 12 as its factors. The options are 240, 120, 60, and 111. Hmm, 111 seems too small because 16 is a factor of 16, but 16 times 7 is 112, which is already bigger than 111. So, 111 can't be right because 16 doesn't divide into it without a remainder. But just to be sure, maybe I should check if 16, 15, and 12 all divide into any of these numbers evenly.\n\nFirst, let's think about what it means for a number to have 16, 15, and 12 as factors. It means that the number is a multiple of all three of these numbers. So, the smallest such number would be the least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 15, and 12.\n\nI remember that to find the LCM of several numbers, it's helpful to factor each number into its prime factors.\n\nLet's factor each number:\n\n- 16: That's 2^4 because 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 16.\n\n- 15: That's 3 \u00d7 5.\n\n- 12: That's 2^2 \u00d7 3.\n\nSo, the prime factors involved are 2, 3, and 5.\n\nTo find the LCM, I need to take the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorization of these numbers.\n\n- For 2: The highest power is 2^4 from 16.\n\n- For 3: The highest power is 3 from 15 and 12.\n\n- For 5: The highest power is 5 from 15.\n\nSo, the LCM should be 2^4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n2^4 is 16.\n\n16 \u00d7 3 is 48.\n\n48 \u00d7 5 is 240.\n\nSo, the LCM of 16, 15, and 12 is 240.\n\nLooking back at the options, 240 is one of them. But is there a smaller number that also has 16, 15, and 12 as factors?\n\nWell, the LCM is the smallest such number, so 240 should be the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check by seeing if 16, 15, and 12 all divide 240 evenly.\n\n- 240 \u00f7 16 = 15, which is a whole number.\n\n- 240 \u00f7 15 = 16, which is a whole number.\n\n- 240 \u00f7 12 = 20, which is a whole number.\n\nPerfect. Now, just to be thorough, let's check the other options to see why they are not correct.\n\nOption B is 120.\n\nDoes 120 have 16, 15, and 12 as factors?\n\n- 120 \u00f7 16 = 7.5, which is not a whole number.\n\nSince 16 doesn't divide evenly into 120, 120 can't be the answer.\n\nOption C is 60.\n\n- 60 \u00f7 16 = 3.75, not a whole number.\n\n- 60 \u00f7 15 = 4, which is a whole number.\n\n- 60 \u00f7 12 = 5, which is a whole number.\n\nSince 16 doesn't divide evenly into 60, it's not a common multiple of all three numbers.\n\nOption D is 111.\n\n- 111 \u00f7 16 = 6.9375, not a whole number.\n\n- 111 \u00f7 15 = 7.4, not a whole number.\n\n- 111 \u00f7 12 = 9.25, not a whole number.\n\nSo, 111 is definitely not a common multiple of these numbers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 240.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]"
