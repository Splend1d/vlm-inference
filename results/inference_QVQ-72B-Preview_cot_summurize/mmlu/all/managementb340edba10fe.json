                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"What is a whistleblower?\" and there are four options to choose from. Let me read them again to make sure I understand. Option A says, \"Someone who reports illegal or unethical acts.\" Option B is, \"Someone who commits illegal or unethical acts.\" Option C is, \"Someone who benefits from illegal or unethical acts.\" And Option D is, \"Someone who devises illegal or unethical acts.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one correctly defines a whistleblower.\n\nFirst off, I know that whistleblowing is usually about reporting something that's wrong or illegal, especially in organizations or governments. So, it's probably related to reporting, not committing or benefiting from those acts. But just to be sure, maybe I should think about some examples.\n\nLet's say there's a company that's polluting a river illegally, and an employee there knows about it. If that employee reports the pollution to the authorities, that person would be a whistleblower, right? So, in this case, the whistleblower is the one who reports the illegal act, which is the pollution. So, according to this scenario, Option A seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, sometimes whistleblowers might also reveal unethical practices that aren't necessarily illegal. For example, maybe the company is treating its workers unfairly, but not in a way that breaks the law. Would reporting that make someone a whistleblower too? I think so. So, maybe the definition should include both illegal and unethical acts.\n\nLooking back at the options, Option A says, \"Someone who reports illegal or unethical acts.\" That seems broad enough to cover both cases\u2014legal and ethical violations. Option B is about committing those acts, which is definitely not whistleblowing. Option C is about benefiting from those acts, which again isn't whistleblowing. Option D is about devising those acts, which is also not whistleblowing.\n\nSo, based on this, Option A seems to be the correct answer. But I should check if there's any chance that whistleblowers could be considered in another category. For instance, sometimes people who report wrongdoings might be seen as troublemakers or snitches by their colleagues, but that doesn't change the fact that they're whistleblowers.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any legal definitions of whistleblowing that might narrow or expand this definition. From what I recall, whistleblower protection laws are designed to protect employees who report misconduct, whether it's illegal activities or serious ethical violations. So, again, that points towards Option A.\n\nAnother angle: if someone devises a scheme to commit fraud and then reports it, would they be considered a whistleblower? Well, that's a bit tricky. If they report it before it happens, maybe they are trying to prevent harm, which aligns with whistleblowing. But if they report it after being involved, they might be seen as both a perpetrator and a whistleblower, depending on the circumstances. But in any case, the act of reporting the wrongdoing makes them a whistleblower.\n\nSo, to sum it up, a whistleblower is someone who reports illegal or unethical acts, which matches Option A. The other options describe actions that are different from whistleblowing: committing, benefiting from, or devising such acts.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. Whistleblowers are reporters of wrongdoings, not the ones who do wrong. So, the correct choice is Option A: Someone who reports illegal or unethical acts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
