                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two sets of words, A and B, where B is a subset of A. We're given some conditions about A and need to determine what must be true about B based on those conditions.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each term means:\n\n- **\u03a3**: This is an alphabet, which is a finite set of symbols.\n\n- **\u03a3***: This is the set of all possible strings (including the empty string) that can be formed using symbols from \u03a3.\n\n- **A and B are sets of words from \u03a3***: So, A and B are collections of strings made from the symbols in \u03a3.\n\n- **B is a subset of A**: This means every word in B is also in A.\n\nNow, let's look at each statement one by one.\n\n**Statement I: If A is finite, then B is finite.**\n\n- **A is finite**: This means there are only a limited number of words in A.\n\n- **B is a subset of A**: Since every word in B is in A, and A is finite, B must also be finite. You can't have an infinite number of words in B if A is finite because B is contained within A.\n\n- **Conclusion**: This statement must be true.\n\n**Statement II: If A is regular, then B is regular.**\n\n- **A is regular**: This means A can be described by a regular expression, recognized by a finite automaton, or decided by a deterministic finite automaton (DFA).\n\n- **B is a subset of A**: So, B is A \u2229 some set, but since B is just a subset of A, we can think of it as A \u2229 B, where B is some set.\n\n- **Question**: Does B being a subset of A imply that B is regular if A is regular?\n\n- **Counterexample**: Consider A = {a^n b^n | n \u2265 0}, which is not regular (it's context-free but not regular). Let B = A, which is a subset of A. Then B is not regular, even though A is regular. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because A is given as regular in this statement.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let's consider A is regular, and B is a subset of A. Does that necessarily make B regular?\n\n- **Another perspective**: Regular languages are closed under intersection and complement, but not necessarily under taking subsets.\n\n- **Example**: Let \u03a3 = {a, b}, A = {a^n b^n | n \u2265 0} \u222a {a^m | m \u2265 0}, where A is regular (since it's a union of two regular languages).\n\n- Let B = {a^n b^n | n \u2265 0}, which is a subset of A.\n\n- But B is context-free, not regular.\n\n- So, even though A is regular, B, being a subset of A, is not necessarily regular.\n\n- **Conclusion**: This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement III: If A is context-free, then B is context-free.**\n\n- **A is context-free**: This means A can be generated by a context-free grammar or recognized by a pushdown automaton.\n\n- **B is a subset of A**: So, B = A \u2229 some set, but since it's just a subset, it's like intersecting A with B.\n\n- **Question**: Does B being a subset of A imply that B is context-free if A is context-free?\n\n- **Closure properties**: Context-free languages are closed under intersection with regular languages, but not under arbitrary intersections or taking arbitrary subsets.\n\n- **Example**: Let A be a context-free language, and let B be a subset of A that is not context-free. Is this possible?\n\n- **Counterexample**: Let \u03a3 = {a, b}, and let A = {a^m b^n | m, n \u2265 0}, which is context-free.\n\n- Let B = {a^n b^n | n \u2265 0}, which is also context-free.\n\n- But if we choose A = {a^m b^n | m, n \u2265 0}, which is context-free, and B = {a^n b^n | n \u2265 0}, which is also context-free.\n\n- But if A is context-free, and B is a subset of A, does that always make B context-free?\n\n- **Another consideration**: Consider A = \u03a3*, which is context-free, and B = {a^n b^n c^n | n \u2265 0}, which is not context-free.\n\n- But B is not a subset of \u03a3*, unless \u03a3 contains c, but even then, if \u03a3 = {a, b, c}, then B is a subset of \u03a3*, but B is not context-free.\n\n- Wait, but \u03a3* is context-free, and B is not context-free, even though B is a subset of \u03a3*.\n\n- So, even if A is context-free, B being a subset of A does not guarantee that B is context-free.\n\n- **Conclusion**: This statement is not necessarily true.\n\nGiven the above analysis:\n\n- Statement I is true: If A is finite, then B is finite.\n\n- Statement II is not necessarily true: There are cases where A is regular, but B, being a subset of A, is not regular.\n\n- Statement III is not necessarily true: There are cases where A is context-free, but B, being a subset of A, is not context-free.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. I only**.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
