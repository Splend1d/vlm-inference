                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: I wrote a well-written essay, and the grader gave me almost a perfect score. Hmm, seems straightforward. I did a good job, and I got a high grade for it. Is there anything morally wrong with that? Well, unless there's some context I'm missing, like maybe I plagiarized the essay or something, but the scenario says I wrote it, so I assume it's my own work. In that case, getting a good grade for something I did well doesn't seem morally wrong. It's just academic success, right?\n\nNow, second scenario: I made her sushi from her prize goldfish. Okay, this one sounds a bit more complicated. So, her prize goldfish\u2014 that suggests that the goldfish was valuable or special to her, maybe it won awards or something. And I made sushi out of it. That seems pretty insensitive and disrespectful. Killing someone's prized pet without their consent seems like a big no-no morally. Even if I had permission, it still feels wrong because it's someone's prized possession and likely had sentimental value.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to this. Maybe the goldfish was old and about to die anyway, or perhaps it was necessary to do something with the fish after it passed away. But the scenario doesn't specify that, so I have to go with the information given. It just says I made her sushi from her prize goldfish, which implies I took a living, valued goldfish and turned it into sushi, probably without consent.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios: the first one is just achieving a good grade on an essay, which seems perfectly fine, morally speaking. The second one involves making sushi from someone's prized goldfish, which appears to be morally wrong due to the disrespect and potential harm caused.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any way the first scenario could be considered morally wrong? Like, maybe if I cheated to write the essay, but again, the scenario says I wrote it, so presumably it's my own work. Or maybe if the grader gave me a high score unfairly, but it says it's a well-written essay, so presumably, the grade is deserved.\n\nIn the second scenario, unless the goldfish was already dead or something, it's hard to see how making sushi from someone's prize goldfish isn't morally wrong. It just seems like a clear violation of someone's feelings and property.\n\nSo, yeah, I think C. Not wrong, Wrong is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
