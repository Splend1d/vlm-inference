                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about making a diluted sulfuric acid solution from a concentrated stock solution. The stock solution is 12.0 M sulfuric acid, and I need to make 100. mL of 4.0 M sulfuric acid. I need to figure out the best procedure among the options given.\n\nFirst, I should recall the dilution formula, which is:\n\n\\[c_1 v_1 = c_2 v_2\\]\n\nwhere \\(c_1\\) is the initial concentration, \\(v_1\\) is the initial volume, \\(c_2\\) is the final concentration, and \\(v_2\\) is the final volume.\n\nIn this case, I'm starting with a 12.0 M solution and I want to end up with a 4.0 M solution, both in terms of sulfuric acid.\n\nGiven that, I can plug in the known values to find the volume of the stock solution needed.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[12.0 \\, \\text{M} \\times v_1 = 4.0 \\, \\text{M} \\times 100. \\, \\text{mL}\\]\n\nSolving for \\(v_1\\):\n\n\\[v_1 = \\frac{4.0 \\, \\text{M} \\times 100. \\, \\text{mL}}{12.0 \\, \\text{M}} = \\frac{400}{12} \\, \\text{mL} = 33.333... \\, \\text{mL}\\]\n\nSo, I need approximately 33.3 mL of the 12.0 M sulfuric acid.\n\nNow, the final volume should be 100 mL, so I need to add water to bring the total volume to 100 mL after adding the acid.\n\nSo, the volume of water needed is:\n\n\\[100. \\, \\text{mL} - 33.3 \\, \\text{mL} = 66.7 \\, \\text{mL}\\]\n\nTherefore, the procedure should be to add 33.3 mL of the 12.0 M acid to a flask and then dilute it with 66.7 mL of water.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Add 33.3 mL of water to the flask, and then add 66.7 mL of 12.0 M acid.\n\nThis seems backwards from what I calculated. It's suggesting adding more acid than water, which would result in a higher concentration than desired.\n\nB. Add 33.3 mL of 12.0 M acid to the flask, and then dilute it with 66.7 mL of water.\n\nThis matches my calculation.\n\nC. Add 67.7 mL of 12.0 M acid to the flask, and then dilute it with 33.3 mL of water.\n\nThis would result in a higher concentration than needed.\n\nD. Add 67.7 mL of water to the flask, and then add 33.3 mL of 12.0 M acid.\n\nThis would result in more water than needed, leading to a lower concentration than desired.\n\nTherefore, the correct procedure is option B: add 33.3 mL of 12.0 M acid to the flask, and then dilute it with 66.7 mL of water.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the dilution formula again:\n\n\\[c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 = c_f (v_1 + v_2)\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(c_1\\) is the concentration of the solute being added (acid)\n\n- \\(v_1\\) is the volume of the solute\n\n- \\(c_2\\) is the concentration of the solvent (water, which is 0 M acid)\n\n- \\(v_2\\) is the volume of the solvent\n\n- \\(c_f\\) is the final concentration\n\n- \\(v_f = v_1 + v_2\\) is the final volume\n\nPlugging in the values for option B:\n\n\\[ (12.0 \\, \\text{M})(33.3 \\, \\text{mL}) + (0 \\, \\text{M})(66.7 \\, \\text{mL}) = c_f (33.3 + 66.7) \\, \\text{mL} \\]\n\n\\[ 399.6 \\, \\text{mmol} + 0 = c_f (100 \\, \\text{mL}) \\]\n\n\\[ c_f = \\frac{399.6 \\, \\text{mmol}}{100 \\, \\text{mL}} = 3.996 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nThis is approximately 4.0 M, which matches the desired concentration.\n\nLet's check option A for comparison:\n\n\\[ (12.0 \\, \\text{M})(66.7 \\, \\text{mL}) + (0 \\, \\text{M})(33.3 \\, \\text{mL}) = c_f (66.7 + 33.3) \\, \\text{mL} \\]\n\n\\[ 800.4 \\, \\text{mmol} + 0 = c_f (100 \\, \\text{mL}) \\]\n\n\\[ c_f = \\frac{800.4 \\, \\text{mmol}}{100 \\, \\text{mL}} = 8.004 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nThis is higher than the desired 4.0 M, so option A is incorrect.\n\nOption C:\n\n\\[ (12.0 \\, \\text{M})(67.7 \\, \\text{mL}) + (0 \\, \\text{M})(33.3 \\, \\text{mL}) = c_f (67.7 + 33.3) \\, \\text{mL} \\]\n\n\\[ 812.4 \\, \\text{mmol} + 0 = c_f (100 \\, \\text{mL}) \\]\n\n\\[ c_f = \\frac{812.4 \\, \\text{mmol}}{100 \\, \\text{mL}} = 8.124 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nAgain, higher than desired.\n\nOption D:\n\n\\[ (12.0 \\, \\text{M})(33.3 \\, \\text{mL}) + (0 \\, \\text{M})(67.7 \\, \\text{mL}) = c_f (33.3 + 67.7) \\, \\text{mL} \\]\n\n\\[ 399.6 \\, \\text{mmol} + 0 = c_f (100 \\, \\text{mL}) \\]\n\n\\[ c_f = \\frac{399.6 \\, \\text{mmol}}{100 \\, \\text{mL}} = 3.996 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nThis is also approximately 4.0 M, but the procedure is different. However, in practice, adding water first and then acid could be risky due to the exothermic nature of sulfuric acid dilution. It's generally safer to add acid to water rather than water to acid.\n\nTherefore, the safer and more accurate procedure is option B: add 33.3 mL of 12.0 M acid to the flask and then dilute it with 66.7 mL of water.\n\nSo, the best answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
