                    "text": "So I have this question about sound waves. It says that a sound wave with frequency \\(f\\) travels through air at speed \\(v\\), and it asks what the speed will be for a sound wave with frequency \\(4f\\). The options are \\(v/4\\), \\(v\\), \\(2v\\), or \\(4v\\).\n\nFirst, I need to recall how sound wave speed works in air. I know that the speed of sound in air depends on properties like the temperature and the medium's density, but I thought that frequency doesn't affect the speed of sound in air. Let me double-check that.\n\nI remember that in air, at a constant temperature and pressure, the speed of sound is pretty much constant, regardless of the frequency. So, if I have two sound waves with different frequencies, but both in the same air conditions, they should travel at the same speed, right?\n\nLet me think about the relationship between frequency, wavelength, and speed. The formula is:\n\n\\[v = f \\times \\lambda\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(v\\) is the speed of sound,\n\n- \\(f\\) is the frequency,\n\n- \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength.\n\nIf the speed of sound \\(v\\) is constant, and frequency \\(f\\) increases, then wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) must decrease proportionally to keep \\(v\\) the same. So, in this case, if frequency quadruples from \\(f\\) to \\(4f\\), the wavelength should quarter from \\(\\lambda\\) to \\(\\lambda/4\\), but the speed \\(v\\) should remain the same.\n\nWait a minute, but is that always true? I think that in some media, the speed of sound can depend on frequency, especially at very high frequencies where dispersion occurs. But for audible sound waves in air, I believe the speed is independent of frequency.\n\nLet me consider the general case. In ideal gases, like air under standard conditions, the speed of sound is given by:\n\n\\[v = \\sqrt{\\gamma \\times \\frac{P}{\\rho}}\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(\\gamma\\) is the adiabatic index,\n\n- \\(P\\) is the pressure,\n\n- \\(\\rho\\) is the density.\n\nSince \\(\\gamma\\), \\(P\\), and \\(\\rho\\) are properties of the medium and not dependent on the frequency of the sound wave, the speed should be the same for different frequencies, as long as the temperature and pressure remain constant.\n\nSo, based on this, the speed of a sound wave with frequency \\(4f\\) should still be \\(v\\), the same as the original speed.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any frequency dependence in real-world scenarios. For example, in air, does the speed of sound change with frequency due to molecular interactions or other factors?\n\nI recall that in reality, air does exhibit some frequency-dependent behavior, especially at ultrasonic frequencies, where molecular relaxation processes can cause the speed to vary slightly. However, for the purposes of this problem, which is likely aimed at understanding the basic relationship between frequency and speed in an idealized scenario, it's safe to assume that the speed remains constant.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the wave equation for sound waves. In a homogeneous isotropic medium like air, the wave equation is linear and the speed of propagation is independent of the frequency of the wave.\n\nAdditionally, thinking about standing waves or resonances in air columns, like in musical instruments, the frequencies are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, and the speed of sound is assumed to be constant, leading to harmonics with frequencies at multiples of the fundamental.\n\nTherefore, in the context of this problem, if a sound wave with frequency \\(f\\) travels at speed \\(v\\), then a sound wave with frequency \\(4f\\) should also travel at speed \\(v\\), assuming that the temperature and pressure haven't changed.\n\nTo wrap it up, the correct answer should be B. v.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ v} \\]"
