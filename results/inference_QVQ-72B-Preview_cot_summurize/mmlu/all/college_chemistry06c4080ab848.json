                    "text": "Let's see what this problem is about. It mentions the equilibrium populations of the 1H energy levels in a molecule, specifically n\u03b1 = n\u03b1eq and n\u03b2 = n\u03b2eq. Then, after a 5.0 \u03bcs pulse with B1 = 4.697 mT, we need to determine what the populations become. There are four options provided.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what n\u03b1 and n\u03b2 represent in the context of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In NMR, protons (1H) have two possible spin states: \u03b1 (up) and \u03b2 (down), relative to an external magnetic field B0. At thermal equilibrium, there are slightly more protons in the lower energy state (\u03b2) than in the higher energy state (\u03b1), following the Boltzmann distribution.\n\nThe populations n\u03b1eq and n\u03b2eq are these equilibrium populations. So, n\u03b1eq < n\u03b2eq.\n\nNow, a pulse is applied, which is a radiofrequency (RF) field B1 that can flip the spins from one state to another. The duration of the pulse is 5.0 \u03bcs, and the magnitude of B1 is 4.697 mT.\n\nI need to find out how this pulse affects the populations n\u03b1 and n\u03b2.\n\nIn NMR, the interaction between the spin and the B1 field causes the spin to precess around the B1 field direction. The strength of the B1 field and the duration of the pulse determine the angle through which the spin is rotated, often referred to as the flip angle.\n\nThe flip angle \u03b8 is given by:\n\n\u03b8 = \u03b3 B1 \u03c4\n\nwhere:\n\n- \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the proton (approximately 2.67522 \u00d7 10^8 rad/T/s)\n\n- B1 is the magnitude of the B1 field in Tesla\n\n- \u03c4 is the pulse duration in seconds\n\nGiven that B1 = 4.697 mT = 4.697 \u00d7 10^-3 T\n\n\u03c4 = 5.0 \u03bcs = 5.0 \u00d7 10^-6 s\n\nSo, \u03b8 = (2.67522 \u00d7 10^8 rad/T/s) \u00d7 (4.697 \u00d7 10^-3 T) \u00d7 (5.0 \u00d7 10^-6 s) = 6.283 rad \u2248 360\u00b0\n\nA 360\u00b0 pulse brings the spins back to their original orientation. Therefore, the populations should return to their original equilibrium values.\n\nWait a minute, but let's calculate it precisely.\n\nFirst, convert all units consistently:\n\nB1 = 4.697 mT = 4.697 \u00d7 10^-3 T\n\n\u03c4 = 5.0 \u03bcs = 5.0 \u00d7 10^-6 s\n\n\u03b3 for proton = 2.67522 \u00d7 10^8 rad/T/s\n\nThen, \u03b8 = \u03b3 \u00d7 B1 \u00d7 \u03c4 = 2.67522 \u00d7 10^8 \u00d7 4.697 \u00d7 10^-3 \u00d7 5.0 \u00d7 10^-6 = 6.283 rad, which is exactly 2\u03c0 radians.\n\nA rotation of 2\u03c0 radians brings the spin state back to its original position. Therefore, the populations n\u03b1 and n\u03b2 should remain unchanged after the pulse.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. n\u03b1 = n\u03b2eq and n\u03b2 = n\u03b1eq\n\nThis suggests that the populations have been swapped, which would correspond to a 180\u00b0 pulse, not a 360\u00b0 pulse.\n\nB. n\u03b1 = n\u03b1eq and n\u03b2 = n\u03b2eq\n\nThis indicates that the populations remain unchanged, which matches our calculation since a 360\u00b0 pulse should bring the system back to its original state.\n\nC. n\u03b1 = \u00bd(n\u03b1eq + n\u03b2eq) and n\u03b2 = \u00bd(n\u03b1eq + n\u03b2eq)\n\nThis suggests equal mixing of the populations, which would be similar to a 90\u00b0 pulse that rotates the spin by 90 degrees, not 360 degrees.\n\nD. n\u03b1 = n\u03b1eq + n\u03b2eq and n\u03b2 = n\u03b1eq + n\u03b2eq\n\nThis seems to suggest that both populations are the sum of the equilibrium populations, which doesn't make physical sense because the total number of spins should be conserved.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B: n\u03b1 = n\u03b1eq and n\u03b2 = n\u03b2eq.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's recall the Bloch equations or the behavior of spins in a magnetic field.\n\nThe Bloch equations describe the behavior of nuclear magnetization in an NMR experiment. Under the rotating frame approximation, the behavior of the magnetization vector M can be described by:\n\ndMx/dt = -\u03b3 B1 My\n\ndMy/dt = \u03b3 B1 Mx\n\ndMz/dt = -\u03b3 B1 Mz\n\nBut in the rotating frame aligned with B1, the transverse components precess around B1.\n\nFor a pulse of duration \u03c4, the rotation of the magnetization vector can be calculated.\n\nThe equilibrium magnetization M0 is along the z-axis (M0z).\n\nAfter a pulse of angle \u03b8, the magnetization components are:\n\nMx(\u03b8) = M0x sin(\u03b8)\n\nMy(\u03b8) = M0y (1 - cos(\u03b8))\n\nMz(\u03b8) = M0z cos(\u03b8)\n\nBut since M0 is along z, M0x = M0y = 0, so Mx(\u03b8) = 0, My(\u03b8) = 0, Mz(\u03b8) = M0z cos(\u03b8)\n\nFor \u03b8 = 2\u03c0, cos(2\u03c0) = 1, so Mz(2\u03c0) = M0z\n\nThus, the longitudinal magnetization returns to its original value, meaning that the populations return to their equilibrium values.\n\nTherefore, n\u03b1 = n\u03b1eq and n\u03b2 = n\u03b2eq, which corresponds to option B.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
