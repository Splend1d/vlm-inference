                    "text": "So I've got this question here about planning models from different authors: Hendrix (2002), Kendall (1999), Merston (1963), and Parkinson and Ekachai (2006). The question is asking what two elements these models have in common, and the options are:\n\nA. Research and evaluation\n\nB. Strategy and evaluation\n\nC. Strategy and implementation\n\nD. Objectives and implementation\n\nNow, I'm not super familiar with all of these models, but I think I can figure this out by looking at each one and seeing what components they include.\n\nLet's start with Merston (1963). I recall that Merston proposed a model for planning that includes steps like setting objectives, determining courses of action, evaluating alternatives, and implementing the chosen course of action. So, objectives and implementation are definitely part of Merston's model.\n\nNext, Kendall (1999). I believe Kendall focused on strategic planning in organizations, emphasizing the importance of setting strategic objectives and then evaluating different strategies to achieve those objectives. So, again, objectives and evaluation seem to be key components here.\n\nHendrix (2002). I think Hendrix discussed planning in the context of project management, where defining clear objectives and evaluating potential strategies or plans is crucial. So, once more, objectives and evaluation appear to be central.\n\nLastly, Parkinson and Ekachai (2006). I'm less familiar with this one, but given that it's about planning models, it's likely to involve setting objectives and evaluating different options to achieve those objectives.\n\nSo, from what I can see, all of these models seem to include elements related to setting objectives and evaluating different options or strategies.\n\nLet me double-check if any of these models exclude strategy or implementation.\n\nFor example, in Merston's model, implementation is definitely included. Kendall's model also talks about implementing strategies. Hendrix likely includes implementation in project planning, and Parkinson and Ekachai probably do as well.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the two elements that all these models have in common. So, if all of them include objectives and evaluation, that seems to be a strong candidate.\n\nBut let's see if there could be another pair that fits all models.\n\nOption A is research and evaluation. While evaluation is present in all models, research might not necessarily be a part of all of them. For instance, Merston's model focuses on objectives and alternative evaluation, but doesn't necessarily emphasize research as a separate component.\n\nOption B is strategy and evaluation. Strategy is important in Kendall's and Hendrix's models, but Merston's model is more about objectives and alternatives, which could encompass strategy, but it's not explicitly labeled as such.\n\nOption C is strategy and implementation. Again, strategy is a part of some models, but not necessarily all, and implementation is included in all, as far as I can tell.\n\nOption D is objectives and implementation. This seems very similar to what I initially thought, but the question specifies \"two elements,\" so perhaps objectives and implementation are both present across these models.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"two elements\" and lists four options, each pairing two elements. So, I need to pick the pair that both elements are common to all models.\n\nFrom my earlier analysis, objectives and evaluation seem to be present in all models. Implementation is also present in all models, but strategy might not be as universally present, at least not explicitly.\n\nLet me think again: Merston (objectives, evaluation, implementation), Kendall (strategy, evaluation, implementation), Hendrix (likely similar to Kendall), and Parkinson and Ekachai (probably similar).\n\nSo, objectives and implementation are in all, strategy is in some but perhaps not all, and evaluation is in all.\n\nBut the question is to find the two elements that all models have in common.\n\nSo, between options A, B, C, and D, which one fits best?\n\nOption A: research and evaluation \u2013 research might not be in all models.\n\nOption B: strategy and evaluation \u2013 strategy might not be in Merston's model explicitly.\n\nOption C: strategy and implementation \u2013 same issue with strategy.\n\nOption D: objectives and implementation \u2013 seems to be in all models.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that evaluation is also present in all models. So, perhaps objectives and evaluation could also be a valid answer.\n\nBut looking back, option A is research and evaluation, which might not fit because research isn't necessarily in all models.\n\nOption B is strategy and evaluation, which might not fit because strategy isn't explicitly in Merston's model.\n\nOption C is strategy and implementation, again strategy might not be in all.\n\nOption D is objectives and implementation, which seems to be in all models.\n\nBut perhaps the models also share evaluation, as I initially thought.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look more carefully.\n\nLet me consider what each model includes:\n\n- Merston (1963): objectives, alternatives, evaluation, implementation.\n\n- Kendall (1999): strategic objectives, evaluation of strategies, implementation.\n\n- Hendrix (2002): likely similar to Kendall, focusing on project objectives, evaluation of plans, implementation.\n\n- Parkinson and Ekachai (2006): probably includes objectives, evaluation, implementation.\n\nSo, objectives and implementation are definitely in all.\n\nEvaluation is also in all, but it's part of the process, not a separate element.\n\nStrategy is present in some models but not necessarily in Merston's, which talks about alternatives.\n\nTherefore, the most consistent elements across all models are objectives and implementation.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Objectives and implementation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
