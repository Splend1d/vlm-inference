One evening, the consumer was driving along a city street when he saw the traffic light facing him turn from green to amber. He sped up, hoping to cross the intersection before the light turned red. However, he quickly realized that he could not do so and applied the brakes, which failed because of a defect in the brake mechanism. The consumer then swerved to avoid hitting a bus that was crossing the intersection at a right angle to him. As a result of the swerve, the consumer's car rode up on the sidewalk and overturned, pinning a pedestrian. Both the consumer and the pedestrian were severely injured. If the consumer asserts a claim against the car dealer based on strict liability in tort, will the plaintiff prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the brakes failed while the consumer was driving his car.\nB.

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a consumer who bought a station wagon from a car dealer, and then had an accident due to a brake defect. The question is whether the consumer can successfully claim strict liability against the car dealer. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst, what does \"strict liability in tort\" mean? I think it's when someone is responsible for damages without having to prove they were negligent or intended to cause harm. So, in product liability cases, if a product is defective and causes injury, the manufacturer or seller can be held liable regardless of whether they knew about the defect or not.\n\nIn this case, the consumer bought a station wagon, and the dealer inspected it before sale. But apparently, there was still a defect in the brake mechanism that caused the brakes to fail.\n\nNow, the consumer was driving, saw a traffic light change from green to amber, and decided to speed up to make it through the intersection before it turned red. But the brakes failed, and he couldn't stop in time. To avoid hitting a bus, he swerved, went onto the sidewalk, overturned the car, and pinned a pedestrian. Both the consumer and the pedestrian were severely injured.\n\nSo, the question is, can the consumer successfully sue the dealer based on strict liability?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because the brakes failed while the consumer was driving his car.\n\nB. Yes, because the brakes failed because of a defect present when the consumer purchased the car.\n\nC. No, because the consumer contributed to his own injury by speeding up.\n\nD. No, because the car dealer carefully inspected the car before selling it.\n\nI need to think about each option.\n\nOption A says yes, because the brakes failed while driving. But is that sufficient for strict liability? I think strict liability in tort requires that the defect in the product caused the injury, not just that the product failed while being used.\n\nOption B adds that the defect was present when the consumer purchased the car. That seems important. If the defect was there at the time of sale, and it caused the injury, then that strengthens the case for strict liability.\n\nOption C says no, because the consumer contributed to his own injury by speeding up. That brings up the concept of contributory negligence. In some jurisdictions, if the plaintiff contributed to their own injury, they might not be able to recover damages. However, nowadays, many places use comparative negligence, where the damages are reduced by the plaintiff's degree of fault.\n\nBut in the context of strict liability, I'm not sure how contributory negligence applies. Maybe the dealer is still liable for the defect, but the consumer's damages might be reduced due to their own actions.\n\nOption D says no, because the dealer inspected the car carefully before selling it. But even if the dealer inspected the car, if there was still a defect that caused injury, strict liability might still apply. Inspection might be a defense in some cases, but not necessarily in strict liability claims.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the best answer is B. Yes, because the brakes failed due to a defect present when the consumer purchased the car.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nStrict liability in tort for products generally requires:\n\n1. The product was defective.\n\n2. The defect was present at the time of sale.\n\n3. The defect caused the injury.\n\nIn this case, the brakes failed due to a defect, which was present when the consumer purchased the car, and it caused the injury.\n\nThe fact that the consumer sped up might be seen as a contributing factor, but it doesn't necessarily negate the dealer's liability for the defect.\n\nAlso, the dealer's inspection might not absolve them if the defect was still there and caused harm.\n\nTherefore, I think the consumer can prevail based on strict liability in tort.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
