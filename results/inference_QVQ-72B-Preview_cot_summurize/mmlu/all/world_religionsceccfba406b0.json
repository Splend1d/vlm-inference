                    "text": "Okay, so I've got this question here: \"How many Jinas have appeared during our age?\" And the options are A. 7, B. 42, C. 24, D. 13. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what a Jina is, but I think it's related to Jainism. Let me see.\n\nFirst off, I should probably understand what a Jina is. From what I recall, in Jainism, a Jina is like a savior or a conqueror, someone who has achieved spiritual enlightenment and liberation. So, these are highly revered figures in Jain tradition.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many of these Jinas have appeared during our age. I need to figure out what \"our age\" refers to in this context. In Jain cosmology, there are different cycles or ages, right? There's the current age or the present cycle of time.\n\nLet me think about the Jain concept of time. Jainism believes in an infinite cycle of time, divided into ages or cycles, each consisting of ascending and descending phases. We are currently in a descending phase, I think.\n\nIn this cycle, Jinas are born at regular intervals to guide humanity towards the right path. So, the number of Jinas in a particular age would be significant in Jain belief.\n\nI remember that there have been 24 Tirthankaras, or Jinas, in the current age. Is that correct? Let me verify that.\n\nStarting from Rishabhanatha, who is considered the first Tirthankara, down to Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara, who lived around the 6th century BCE. So, that would make 24 Jinas in total for this age.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 24 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I should check if there's any other context or if \"our age\" refers to something else. In some traditions, the number of Jinas can vary, but I think 24 is the standard number in Jainism.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the possibility of different Jain sects having different beliefs about the number of Jinas. For example, Digambara and Svetambara are two main sects of Jainism. Do they differ in the number of Jinas they recognize?\n\nI don't think so. Both sects recognize the 24 Tirthankaras, although there might be some differences in their interpretations or practices.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps \"our age\" refers to a different cycle, and there are more or fewer Jinas in that cycle. But that seems unlikely. The term \"our age\" probably refers to the current cycle we are in.\n\nAdditionally, I recall that in Jain cosmology, each time cycle has 24 Tirthankaras, and we are in the current descending phase where the 24 Tirthankaras have already appeared.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer should be C. 24.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can think about the significance of the number 24 in Jainism. It's a important number because it represents the complete set of Tirthankaras who guide souls towards liberation in each time cycle.\n\nMoreover, each Tirthankara has left behind teachings and examples that Jains follow to achieve moksha, or liberation from the cycle of birth and death.\n\nTherefore, in conclusion, the number of Jinas that have appeared during our age is 24, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
