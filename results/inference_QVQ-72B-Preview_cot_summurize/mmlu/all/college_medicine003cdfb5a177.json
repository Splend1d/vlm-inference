                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"How can several different proteins be produced from the same gene?\" And there are four options to choose from. I need to pick the correct one. Let me read them again to make sure I understand.\n\nOption A says, \"By selective transcription of different parts of the DNA in the gene.\"\n\nOption B is, \"By doubling or tripling the length of the mRNA molecule produced from the primary transcript.\"\n\nOption C is, \"The primary transcripts of many genes can be spliced in various ways to produce different mRNAs, a process known as alternative RNA splicing.\"\n\nAnd option D is, \"By splicing of the mRNA molecule after it has been formed from the primary transcript.\"\n\nAlright, so all of these options are related to how genes are expressed into proteins, right? And specifically, they're talking about how one gene can lead to multiple proteins. This sounds like it has something to do with RNA splicing, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that genes are segments of DNA that code for proteins. The process of making a protein from a gene involves transcription and translation. Transcription is when DNA is transcribed into mRNA, and then translation is when mRNA is translated into a protein. But sometimes, the same gene can produce different proteins. How does that happen?\n\nOption A mentions selective transcription of different parts of the DNA. Does that mean that different parts of the gene are transcribed at different times? That could potentially lead to different mRNAs being produced, which would then code for different proteins. But I think there's more to it than just selective transcription.\n\nOption B talks about doubling or tripling the length of the mRNA molecule from the primary transcript. Hmm, I'm not sure about this one. Typically, the primary transcript is processed into mRNA by splicing out introns and keeping exons. But I don't recall anything about doubling or tripling the length of the mRNA. That seems unlikely.\n\nOption C mentions alternative RNA splicing, where the primary transcript can be spliced in different ways to produce different mRNAs. This sounds familiar. I think this is a process where exons can be included or skipped in different combinations, leading to different protein products. This seems like a plausible answer.\n\nOption D says that splicing occurs after the mRNA has been formed from the primary transcript. Well, I know that splicing is a part of mRNA processing, and it happens after transcription but before translation. So, this seems to be describing when splicing occurs, but it doesn't specify that it leads to different proteins.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think about this differently. Let's consider what alternative splicing actually is. Alternative splicing is when different combinations of exons are included in the final mRNA, leading to different protein variants. So, from the same gene, different mRNAs can be produced by splicing the primary transcript in various ways.\n\nOption C seems to be describing this process accurately. It mentions that primary transcripts can be spliced in various ways to produce different mRNAs, and it refers to this as alternative RNA splicing. That sounds correct.\n\nOption A talks about selective transcription of different parts of the DNA. While it's possible that different regions of a gene could be transcribed under different conditions, I don't think this is the primary mechanism for producing multiple proteins from one gene. It might contribute, but alternative splicing seems more directly related.\n\nOption B still seems off to me. Doubling or tripling the mRNA length doesn't align with what I know about gene expression. Usually, the mRNA is processed to remove introns and keep exons, but I don't think it involves increasing the length in the way described here.\n\nOption D is stating that splicing occurs after the mRNA is formed, which is true, but it doesn't explain how this leads to different proteins. It's more of a description of when splicing happens rather than how it contributes to producing multiple proteins from one gene.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option C is the best answer. It directly addresses the process of alternative RNA splicing, which allows for the production of different mRNAs from the same gene by varying the way the primary transcript is spliced.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there are any other mechanisms that could lead to multiple proteins from one gene. For example, there's RNA editing, where the mRNA is modified after transcription, changing the sequence and potentially leading to different proteins. However, that's not what any of these options are describing.\n\nAlso, there's the use of alternative promoters or alternative polyadenylation sites, which could lead to different transcripts from the same gene. But again, that's not exactly what's being described in these options.\n\nSo, I think my initial conclusion is correct. Option C is the correct answer because it accurately describes the process of alternative RNA splicing, which allows for the production of several different proteins from the same gene.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
