Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nWhich of the following would best support the author's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment?\n\nA. The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations\nB. The continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market\nC.

                    "text": "So I'm trying to answer this question about Walter Rodney's views on African underdevelopment. The question is asking which option best supports his assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment. The options are:\n\nA. The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations\n\nB. The continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market\n\nC. The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company\n\nD. The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Walter Rodney is saying in the passage. He argues that the imperialist system is mainly responsible for Africa's economic retardation because it drained African wealth and hindered the development of the continent's resources. Secondly, he points to the capitalists of Western Europe as the active agents in extending this exploitation across Africa.\n\nSo, I need to find an option that directly involves Western European capitalists in the underdevelopment of Africa through the imperialist system.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations.\n\nI know that the transatlantic slave trade was a major part of the imperialist system, where millions of Africans were enslaved and taken to the Americas, particularly to places like the Caribbean, to work on plantations. This was driven by European countries, especially Western European nations like Britain, Portugal, and Spain, who had significant interests in the Caribbean sugar trade.\n\nThis option seems relevant because it involves Western European capitalists directly profiting from the exploitation of African labor and resources. The slave trade was a massive drain on African populations and economies, as it involved the forced removal of millions of people, which had a devastating impact on the continent's development.\n\nOption B: The continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market.\n\nWhile it's true that there was a slave trade involving Arabian merchants, this seems to be more focused on the Mediterranean region and possibly North Africa. The key point here is that it's being carried out by Arabian merchants, not Western European capitalists.\n\nWalter Rodney is specifically pointing to Western European capitalists as the main agents of exploitation. So, while the Arabian slave trade was certainly detrimental to Africa, it doesn't directly support Rodney's assertion about Western European responsibility.\n\nOption C: The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company.\n\nThe Dutch East India Company was a Dutch trading company that played a significant role in the spice trade and other commercial ventures in Asia. They established the Cape Colony in South Africa primarily as a resupply station for their ships traveling to Asia.\n\nWhile the Dutch are considered a Western European power, the primary focus here was on trade with Asia, not directly on the exploitation of African resources or the slave trade in the same way that the transatlantic slave trade was focused on the Americas.\n\nMoreover, the Dutch East India Company was more about establishing trading posts and controlling trade routes rather than directly exploiting African labor or resources on the scale of the slave trade.\n\nOption D: The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia.\n\nEthiopia has a long history of trade with various parts of the world, including Europe. However, Ethiopia was largely independent and not subjected to the same levels of imperialist exploitation as other parts of Africa.\n\nIn fact, Ethiopia successfully resisted colonization by European powers, most notably defeating the Italians at the Battle of Adwa in 1896. As a result, its trade links with Europe were more voluntary and less exploitative than in other parts of the continent.\n\nGiven Walter Rodney's focus on the imperialist system and the exploitation by Western European capitalists, this option doesn't seem to align well with his assertion.\n\nAfter considering all the options, Option A seems to be the one that best supports Walter Rodney's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment.\n\nThe transatlantic slave trade was a massive enterprise led by Western European powers, which directly drained African human resources and hindered its economic development. It was a central component of the imperialist system that Rodney criticizes for underdeveloping Africa.\n\nOptions B, C, and D either involve non-Western European actors (like Arabian merchants), have a different focus (like the Dutch East India Company's activities in Asia), or involve a country that resisted colonization (Ethiopia), making them less directly relevant to Rodney's argument.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is Option A: The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
