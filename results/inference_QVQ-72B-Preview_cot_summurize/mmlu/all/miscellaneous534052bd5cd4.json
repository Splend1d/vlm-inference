                    "text": "So I need to figure out which famous radio personality was the voice of Shaggy on the cartoon \"Scooby-Doo.\" The options are Rush Limbaugh, Casey Kasem, Larry King, and Howard Stern. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that \"Scooby-Doo\" is a popular animated show about a group of teenagers and their talking dog solving mysteries. Shaggy is one of the main characters, known for his love of food and his famous catchphrase \"Zoinks!\" He's portrayed as a bit of a coward but has a big heart.\n\nNow, I need to recall who voiced Shaggy originally. I think the original series aired in the late 1960s, so it's been around for a while. Let me consider each option:\n\nA. Rush Limbaugh: I know Rush Limbaugh was a conservative radio host and commentator. He was pretty famous for his radio show, but I don't recall him being involved in voice acting for cartoons. Maybe he did some guest appearances, but I don't think he was the regular voice of Shaggy.\n\nB. Casey Kasem: Now, Casey Kasem was a well-known radio personality, famous for his countdown shows like \"American Top 40.\" I seem to remember that he did some voice acting as well. In fact, I think he was the original voice of Shaggy in \"Scooby-Doo.\" Let me double-check that.\n\nC. Larry King: Larry King was a famous talk show host, known for his interviews with celebrities and newsmakers. While he was a prominent figure in radio and television, I don't think he was involved in voice acting for cartoons like \"Scooby-Doo.\"\n\nD. Howard Stern: Howard Stern is a controversial radio host, known for his shock jock style. He's had a long career in radio and has been involved in some voice acting, but I don't believe he was the voice of Shaggy.\n\nLet me think again about Casey Kasem. I'm pretty sure he was the original voice of Shaggy. In fact, I think he voiced Shaggy in the early series and maybe in some later revivals as well. He was known for his distinctive voice and was involved in various animated shows beyond \"Scooby-Doo.\"\n\nWait a minute, I should make sure that none of the other options were involved in voicing Shaggy at some point. Maybe one of them did a guest voice or something, but I don't think any of them were the regular voice actors for Shaggy.\n\nI should also consider if there were multiple voice actors for Shaggy over the years. It's possible that the role has been reprised by different actors, especially as the series has continued over decades. However, I think Casey Kasem was the most famous and longest-running voice of Shaggy.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider each option again:\n\n- Rush Limbaugh: Not known for voice acting in cartoons.\n\n- Casey Kasem: Famous radio personality and known for voicing Shaggy.\n\n- Larry King: Known for interviews, not voice acting.\n\n- Howard Stern: Known for shock radio and some voice acting, but not Shaggy.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer should be Casey Kasem.\n\nWait, but the question says \"also\" the voice of Shaggy. That suggests that the person listed is both a famous radio personality and the voice of Shaggy. So, it's not just about being a radio personality who did some voice acting, but specifically the one who voiced Shaggy.\n\nI think I'm confident with my choice. The correct answer is B. Casey Kasem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Casey Kasem}} \\]"
