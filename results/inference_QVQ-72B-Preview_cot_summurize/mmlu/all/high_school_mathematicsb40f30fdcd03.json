                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have three functions: f(x) = 3x, g(x) = 5x + 3, and h(x) = 1 \u2013 x\u00b2. We need to find the composition f(g(h(x))), and then determine which of the given options it matches.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what f(g(h(x))) means. It means we start with h(x), then plug that into g, and finally plug that result into f. So, it's like a chain reaction: h affects g, and then g affects f.\n\nAlright, let's start by finding h(x). Given that h(x) = 1 \u2013 x\u00b2, I need to express this in a way that I can plug it into g(x).\n\nNext, I need to find g(h(x)). Since g(x) = 5x + 3, I substitute h(x) for x in g(x). So, g(h(x)) = 5*(h(x)) + 3 = 5*(1 \u2013 x\u00b2) + 3.\n\nLet me calculate that: 5*(1 \u2013 x\u00b2) is 5 - 5x\u00b2, and then adding 3 gives me 5 - 5x\u00b2 + 3 = 8 - 5x\u00b2. So, g(h(x)) = 8 - 5x\u00b2.\n\nNow, I need to find f(g(h(x))), which is f(8 - 5x\u00b2). Given that f(x) = 3x, I substitute 8 - 5x\u00b2 for x in f(x). So, f(g(h(x))) = 3*(8 - 5x\u00b2).\n\nLet's compute that: 3*8 is 24, and 3*(-5x\u00b2) is -15x\u00b2. So, f(g(h(x))) = 24 - 15x\u00b2.\n\nLooking back at the options, I see that option C is \u201315x\u00b2 + 24, which is the same as what I just calculated, since addition is commutative (meaning the order doesn't matter).\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, h(x) = 1 \u2013 x\u00b2. That's straightforward.\n\nSecond, g(h(x)) = 5*(h(x)) + 3 = 5*(1 \u2013 x\u00b2) + 3 = 5 - 5x\u00b2 + 3 = 8 - 5x\u00b2. That seems correct.\n\nThird, f(g(h(x))) = 3*(8 - 5x\u00b2) = 24 - 15x\u00b2. Yep, that looks right.\n\nSo, the answer should be option C: \u201315x\u00b2 + 24.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nMaybe I could consider the composition in a different order, but I think the step-by-step approach is the most straightforward here.\n\nAlternatively, I could try plugging in a specific value for x and see which option matches the result, but that might not be as efficient as the algebraic approach I've already taken.\n\nI think I'm confident with my answer. The composition f(g(h(x))) equals \u201315x\u00b2 + 24, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
