                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that if an equilateral triangle has a side of length 8, what will be the area of a square that has the same perimeter as this triangle? And the options are 9, 16, 36, and 49.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what an equilateral triangle is. I remember that an equilateral triangle is one where all three sides are equal. So, if each side is of length 8, then the perimeter of the triangle would be 3 times 8, right? Let me calculate that: 3 times 8 is 24. So, the perimeter of the triangle is 24.\n\nNow, I need to find the area of a square that has the same perimeter as this triangle. That means the perimeter of the square should also be 24. I know that in a square, all four sides are equal. So, if the perimeter is 24, then each side of the square would be 24 divided by 4. Let's do that calculation: 24 divided by 4 is 6. So, each side of the square is 6.\n\nTo find the area of the square, I need to square the length of its side. That is, area equals side squared. So, area is 6 squared, which is 36. Looking back at the options, 36 is one of them, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the beginning: the triangle is equilateral with each side of length 8. Perimeter should indeed be 3 times 8, which is 24. For the square, perimeter is 4 times the side length, so side length is perimeter divided by 4, which is 24 divided by 4, giving 6. Area is side squared, so 6 times 6 is 36.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using the properties of equilateral triangles or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a trap here that I'm missing. Let me think about it differently. Maybe I need to consider the relationship between the perimeter and the area for these shapes.\n\nWait a minute, the problem is asking for the area of the square that has the same perimeter as the triangle. So, as long as the perimeters are equal, the shapes themselves don't have to be similar, right? So, focusing solely on the perimeter for the square should suffice.\n\nAnother thought: could there be confusion between perimeter and area? Sometimes, problems can be tricky by mixing up perimeter and area concepts. But in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nLet me consider if there's any need to calculate the height of the triangle or something like that. No, the problem doesn't ask for any parts related to the triangle beyond its perimeter.\n\nSo, to reiterate, the perimeter of the triangle is 24, and the square has the same perimeter, which is also 24. Therefore, each side of the square is 6, and the area is 36.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. The correct option should be C. 36.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]"
