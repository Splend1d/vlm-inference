The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the farmer and begins formulating plans for constructing single-family dwelling units on the land. The original deed between the farmer and the development company contains a provision expressly binding \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single- family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called phase 1. Two years later, the president sold the remaining parcel, which had not been included in the phase 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single-family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as phase 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in phase 2. Meanwhile, after the farmer's death, his estate isrequired to sell the remaining 250-acre parcel of his farmland. The buyer is an investor, who proposes to construct a two-level shopping center and parking lot on the property. The area surrounding phase 1 and phase 2 was rezoned for commercial and industrial uses in 2010. The investor's shopping center has grown to include 150 stores. Now, one of the lot owners in phase 1 contracts to sell his property to two physicians who plan to start a suburban medical practice. In an action by the homeowners in phase 1 to prevent such commercial use by the physicians, the court will most likely hold that\n\nA. the restrictions are still enforceable, thus preventing such commercial use.\nB. the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because the offering of personal services (i. e. , medical) would be a conforming use.\nC. the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because of the change in the character of the neighborhood.\nD. the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because the opening of a physician's office in a private home would not be construed as a commercial enterprise.\n"

                    "text": "Okay, this is a pretty involved property law scenario. Let's try to break it down step by step. So, in 1998, there's a farmer who owns 1,000 acres and decides to sell it in parcels of 250 acres each. A development company buys three of these parcels from the farmer. There's a deed restriction that says any further subdivisions must have minimum two-acre lots for single-family dwelling units only, and this restriction binds all future owners.\n\nThe development company then subdivides two of these parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres and starts building homes, which they call Phase 1. These original deed restrictions are included in the special warranty deeds given to the buyers in Phase 1.\n\nTwo years later, the development company sells the remaining parcel to a contractor. This contractor divides the 250-acre parcel into one-acre lots and builds single-family dwelling units in what's called Phase 2. However, the deeds to the buyers in Phase 2 don't mention the two-acre minimum lot restriction.\n\nAfter the farmer's death, his estate sells the last 250-acre parcel, which is then developed into a two-level shopping center with 150 stores. The surrounding area was rezoned for commercial and industrial uses in 2010.\n\nNow, a lot owner in Phase 1 wants to sell to two physicians who plan to open a suburban medical practice. The homeowners in Phase 1 are trying to stop this, claiming that it violates the deed restrictions.\n\nThe question is: in a court action by the Phase 1 homeowners to prevent the medical practice, what will the court most likely decide?\n\nOptions are:\n\nA. The restrictions are still enforceable, preventing commercial use.\n\nB. The restrictions are no longer enforceable because offering personal services like medical care is a conforming use.\n\nC. The restrictions are no longer enforceable due to the change in the character of the neighborhood.\n\nD. The restrictions are no longer enforceable because opening a physician's office in a private home isn't considered a commercial enterprise.\n\nAlright, let's analyze this.\n\nFirst, we have deed restrictions that require lots to be at least two acres for single-family dwelling units only. These restrictions were in the original deed between the farmer and the development company and were passed on to the buyers in Phase 1.\n\nHowever, in Phase 2, the deeds didn't include this restriction, so it's likely that the one-acre lots in Phase 2 are not bound by the two-acre minimum restriction.\n\nBut the restriction specifies that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots for single-family dwelling units only, and it's binding on all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns.\n\nSo, the restriction was intended to bind future owners.\n\nNow, the shopping center was built on a separate parcel that was sold after the farmer's death, and the area was rezoned for commercial and industrial uses in 2010.\n\nThe physicians want to open a medical practice in Phase 1, which is supposed to be for single-family dwelling units only.\n\nSo, the question is whether the deed restrictions still apply to Phase 1 lots.\n\nOption A says the restrictions are still enforceable, preventing commercial use.\n\nOption B says the restrictions are no longer enforceable because medical services are a conforming use.\n\nOption C says the restrictions are no longer enforceable due to the change in the character of the neighborhood.\n\nOption D says the restrictions are no longer enforceable because a physician's office in a private home isn't considered a commercial enterprise.\n\nLet's consider each option.\n\nStarting with Option A: restrictions still enforceable.\n\nWell, the original deed restrictions were binding on all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns, and were included in the deeds for Phase 1. So, in theory, these restrictions should still be enforceable against the Phase 1 lots.\n\nHowever, there might be circumstances that could make these restrictions unenforceable.\n\nFor example, if the character of the neighborhood has changed significantly, courts might decide that the restrictions are no longer relevant or that enforcing them would be unfair.\n\nIn this case, there's a large shopping center nearby, and the area has been rezoned for commercial and industrial uses.\n\nThat suggests a significant change in the character of the neighborhood.\n\nOption C suggests that because of this change, the restrictions are no longer enforceable.\n\nOption B mentions that offering personal services like medical care might be a conforming use, meaning it's allowed despite the restrictions.\n\nOption D argues that a physician's office in a private home isn't considered a commercial enterprise, so the restrictions wouldn't apply.\n\nNow, let's think about zoning and deed restrictions.\n\nZoning regulations are imposed by local governments to control land use, while deed restrictions are private agreements that run with the land.\n\nGenerally, deed restrictions can be more restrictive than zoning, meaning that even if zoning allows certain uses, deed restrictions can prohibit them if they're more restrictive.\n\nIn this case, the zoning allows commercial and industrial uses, but the deed restrictions specify single-family dwelling units only.\n\nSo, between the two, deed restrictions are typically enforceable if they're valid and binding, regardless of zoning changes.\n\nHowever, courts may consider whether the purpose of the restrictions has been frustrated by changes in the neighborhood or by zoning changes.\n\nIn this scenario, the neighborhood has indeed changed with the construction of a large shopping center and the rezoning for commercial and industrial uses.\n\nThis could be seen as a significant change in the character of the neighborhood, which might lead a court to decide that the original restrictions are no longer appropriate or enforceable.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that Phase 2 was subdivided into one-acre lots without the two-acre minimum restriction might indicate that the restrictions are not being uniformly enforced or that they're no longer being followed.\n\nMoreover, the physicians are planning to open a medical practice, which is a type of personal service use.\n\nDepending on local regulations, medical offices might be considered a type of commercial use or a professional office use, which is often allowed in residential areas under certain conditions.\n\nBut in this case, the deed restrictions specify single-family dwelling units only, so a medical practice would violate that restriction unless there's an exception or the restrictions are no longer enforceable.\n\nGiven that, I need to consider whether the restrictions remain enforceable despite the changes in the neighborhood and zoning.\n\nI recall that in property law, restrictions can be enforced as long as they're valid and binding, even if zoning laws change.\n\nHowever, courts may not enforce restrictions if they've become obsolete due to significant changes in the neighborhood.\n\nIn this scenario, the presence of a large shopping center and the rezoning for commercial and industrial uses suggest substantial changes.\n\nThis could be a basis for the court to decide that the restrictions are no longer enforceable.\n\nAlternatively, the court might rule that the restrictions still apply to Phase 1 lots because they were explicitly included in the deeds and are binding on all subsequent owners.\n\nBut considering the changes in the surrounding area, it's possible that the court would find that the character of the neighborhood has changed to such an extent that enforcing the restrictions would be unfair or no longer serve their original purpose.\n\nTherefore, Option C seems plausible: the restrictions are no longer enforceable due to the change in the character of the neighborhood.\n\nOption A suggests that the restrictions are still enforceable, but given the significant changes, it's possible that the court would decide otherwise.\n\nOption B mentions that offering personal services like medical care is a conforming use, but in this case, the restrictions specify single-family dwelling units only, so a medical practice would still be a violation unless the restrictions are no longer enforceable.\n\nOption D argues that a physician's office in a private home isn't considered a commercial enterprise, but that might not necessarily be the case, as medical practices are often considered professional offices, which could be seen as commercial uses.\n\nGiven all that, I think Option C is the most likely answer: the restrictions are no longer enforceable due to the change in the character of the neighborhood.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
