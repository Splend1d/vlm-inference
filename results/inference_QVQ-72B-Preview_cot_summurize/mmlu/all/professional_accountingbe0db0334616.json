                    "text": "So I've got this question about Cooley Co. and their unrealized gain on a debt investment that's classified as available-for-sale. The gain is $100,000, and their corporate tax rate is 25%. I need to figure out how much of this gain should be included in their net income and how much should go to other comprehensive income at the end of the current year. The options are:\n\nA. $100,000 $0\n\nB. $75,000 $25,000\n\nC. $25,000 $75,000\n\nD. $0 $75,000\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what an available-for-sale debt investment means in terms of accounting treatment, especially regarding unrealized gains and losses.\n\nFrom what I recall, available-for-sale securities are debt or equity investments that aren't held for trading purposes but might be sold before maturity based on the company's needs. Their fair value fluctuations are recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) rather than directly in net income, unless there's an impairment or something like that.\n\nSo, if there's an unrealized gain of $100,000 on such an investment, my initial thought is that this gain would be reported in other comprehensive income. But wait, the question mentions tax rate, which suggests that taxes might affect how this gain is reported.\n\nLet me think about taxes here. Since it's an unrealized gain, it hasn't been realized through a sale, so typically, companies don't pay taxes on unrealized gains in the current period. Instead, taxes are generally recognized when the gain is realized upon sale.\n\nBut maybe there's some temporary difference here that creates a deferred tax liability or asset. Let me recall how deferred taxes work.\n\nIf there's an unrealized gain, the book value (carrying amount) of the investment increases by $100,000, but the tax basis remains unchanged because taxes aren't paid on unrealized gains. So, there's a temporary difference: the book value is higher than the tax basis by $100,000.\n\nThis would create a deferred tax liability because eventually, when the gain is realized, the company will have to pay taxes on it.\n\nSo, the deferred tax liability would be $100,000 multiplied by the tax rate of 25%, which is $25,000.\n\nNow, how does this affect the reporting of the gain?\n\nThe unrealized gain is reported in other comprehensive income, and the deferred tax liability is also recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nWait, is that right? Actually, I think deferred taxes on other comprehensive income items are recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nLet me see: the unrealized gain of $100,000 goes to OCI, and the related deferred tax liability of $25,000 also goes to OCI. So, the total effect on OCI would be $100,000 - $25,000 = $75,000.\n\nBut does that make sense? If the gain is reported in OCI and the tax effect is also reported in OCI, then the net effect in OCI would be $75,000.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for net income and other comprehensive income amounts. So, net income isn't directly affected by the unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities. Instead, it's reported in OCI.\n\nTherefore, net income would be $0 affected by this transaction, and OCI would be increased by $75,000.\n\nBut let me double-check this.\n\nAlternative perspective: maybe there's some adjustment to net income via deferred taxes or something.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a reclassification adjustment from OCI to net income in certain circumstances, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nLet me consider the accounting treatment again.\n\nFor available-for-sale securities, unrealized gains and losses are reported in other comprehensive income, bypassing net income, unless there's an other-than-temporary impairment.\n\nSo, the $100,000 gain goes to OCI.\n\nThen, the deferred tax liability of $25,000 is recognized in OCI as well.\n\nTherefore, the net effect in OCI is $100,000 - $25,000 = $75,000.\n\nNet income isn't directly affected by this gain because it's unrealized.\n\nSo, the answer should be $0 in net income and $75,000 in other comprehensive income.\n\nLooking back at the options, that's option D.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure there isn't something I'm missing.\n\nIs there any chance that the unrealized gain could be taxed in the current period, thus affecting net income?\n\nI don't think so. Generally, unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities aren't taxable until realized.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be D: $0 in net income and $75,000 in other comprehensive income.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
