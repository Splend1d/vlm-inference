                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about Hardin and his views on \"sharing ethics.\" I'm not entirely sure what \"sharing ethics\" refers to in this context, but I know that Garrett Hardin was a population ecologist who wrote about environmental issues and the concept of the \"tragedy of the commons.\" Let me see if I can connect these dots.\n\nFirst off, the \"tragedy of the commons\" is a concept where individuals acting in their own self-interest can deplete a shared resource, leading to long-term negative consequences for everyone. So, if \"sharing ethics\" is about promoting the idea that we should share resources more equitably, Hardin might argue that this could lead to overuse and depletion of those resources, hence another \"tragedy of the commons.\"\n\nOption C suggests that the fundamental error of \"sharing ethics\" is that it would lead to a \"tragedy of the commons.\" That seems plausible based on what I just thought.\n\nNow, option B says it would require a stronger system of taxation for the affluent. Hmm, that's interesting. Maybe Hardin believed that implementing sharing ethics would necessitate higher taxes on the rich to redistribute wealth, which he might have seen as problematic or inefficient. But I'm not sure if that's the fundamental error he saw.\n\nOption A says it's anti-Christian. I don't know much about Hardin's religious views, but I doubt that's the main point he was making. His work seems more focused on environmental and population dynamics rather than religious ethics.\n\nOption D says all of the above, so if any one of these is correct, then D would be correct too. But I think I can eliminate A and B as less likely.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that Hardin was critical of moral imperatives that promote unlimited sharing without considering the environmental impacts. He might have argued that such ethics ignore the biological realities of population growth and resource limits, which could lead to overexploitation of common resources\u2014hence, another tragedy of the commons.\n\nThat makes sense. So, in that case, the fundamental error would be that sharing ethics don't account for the environmental consequences of increased sharing and cooperation, potentially leading to greater demand on limited resources.\n\nBut I should double-check. Let me think about one of Hardin's famous essays, \"The Tragedy of the Commons,\" which was published in 1968. In that essay, he discusses the problems of overpopulation and the use of common resources like pasture land. He argues that unless there are restrictions on reproduction and resource use, we're headed towards disaster.\n\nSo, if \"sharing ethics\" promotes more sharing of resources without addressing the constraints on population growth or consumption, Hardin might argue that it's just delaying the inevitable tragedy.\n\nGiven that, option C seems the most directly related to his main argument.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Perhaps he also thought that implementing sharing ethics would require more government intervention, like higher taxes on the wealthy to redistribute wealth, which he might have opposed on efficiency or liberty grounds.\n\nHowever, I don't recall that being a central part of his argument in \"The Tragedy of the Commons.\" His focus was more on the environmental and population aspects.\n\nAs for option A, being anti-Christian, that just doesn't ring true. Hardin's work was more scientific and less rooted in religious debate.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C: it would lead to a \"tragedy of the commons.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
