                    "text": "So I have this problem here: I need to find out how much work is required to charge a 10 microfarad capacitor to a potential difference of 100 volts. The options are A. 0.005 J, B. 0.01 J, C. 0.05 J, and D. 0.1 J.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relationship between work, capacitance, and potential difference. I know that when you charge a capacitor, you're storing energy in it, and that energy is the work done to charge it.\n\nThe formula that comes to mind is:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{1}{2} C V^{2} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( E \\) is the energy stored in the capacitor,\n\n- \\( C \\) is the capacitance,\n\n- \\( V \\) is the potential difference.\n\nSo, if I plug in the values I have, which are \\( C = 10 \\, \\mu \\text{F} \\) and \\( V = 100 \\, \\text{V} \\), I should be able to find the energy.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that all units are consistent. Capacitance is in farads (F), and potential difference is in volts (V), and energy is in joules (J). So, 10 microfarads is \\( 10 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{F} \\).\n\nLet me substitute these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{F} \\times (100 \\, \\text{V})^{2} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 100^{2} \\):\n\n\\[ 100^{2} = 10,000 \\, \\text{V}^{2} \\]\n\nThen, multiply by the capacitance:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 10,000 \\]\n\nLet's compute \\( 10 \\times 10^{-6} \\):\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 10^{-6} = 10^{-5} \\, \\text{F} \\]\n\nNow, multiply by 10,000 V\u00b2:\n\n\\[ 10^{-5} \\times 10,000 = 0.1 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nFinally, divide by 2:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{0.1}{2} = 0.05 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nSo, the work required is 0.05 joules, which corresponds to option C.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the formula:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{1}{2} C V^{2} \\]\n\nSubstituting:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times 10^{-6} \\times (100)^{2} \\]\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10^{-5} \\times 10,000 \\]\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.1 \\]\n\n\\[ E = 0.05 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I know another formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{Q^{2}}{2C} \\]\n\nwhere \\( Q \\) is the charge stored on the capacitor. Since \\( Q = C V \\), I could substitute that in:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{(C V)^{2}}{2C} = \\frac{C V^{2}}{2} \\]\n\nWhich is the same as the first formula I used. So, it checks out.\n\nI think I've got it right. The answer should be 0.05 joules.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
