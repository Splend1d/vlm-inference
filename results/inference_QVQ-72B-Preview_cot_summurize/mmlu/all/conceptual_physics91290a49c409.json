                    "text": "So I have this problem about radioactive decay. It says that a radioactive sample has a half-life of 1 hour. If we start with 1.000 gram of it at noon, how much remains at 3:00 pm? The options are 0.50 g, 0.25 g, 0.125 g, and 0.0625 g.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what half-life means. Half-life is the time it takes for half of the radioactive material to decay. So, every hour, half of the remaining material decays.\n\nLet's see, we start at noon with 1.000 gram. After one hour, which is 1:00 pm, half of it decays, so it should be 0.500 gram left. Then, another hour passes, so at 2:00 pm, half of 0.500 gram decays, leaving 0.250 gram. And then another hour to 3:00 pm, half of 0.250 gram decays, leaving 0.125 gram.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, 0.125 g is one of them. But let me make sure if there's another way to calculate this.\n\nI recall that the formula for radioactive decay is:\n\nN(t) = N\u2080 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N(t) is the amount at time t\n\n- N\u2080 is the initial amount\n\n- t is the time elapsed\n\n- T is the half-life\n\nIn this case, N\u2080 = 1.000 g, T = 1 hour, and t = 3 hours (from noon to 3:00 pm).\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nN(3) = 1.000 * (1/2)^(3/1) = 1.000 * (1/2)^3 = 1.000 * 0.125 = 0.125 g\n\nSo, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check the time. From noon to 1:00 pm is 1 hour, to 2:00 pm is 2 hours, and to 3:00 pm is 3 hours. So, t = 3 hours is correct.\n\nAlternatively, since the half-life is 1 hour, and 3 hours have passed, the material has gone through 3 half-lives.\n\nEach half-life multiplies the remaining amount by 1/2.\n\nSo, 1 * (1/2)^3 = 1/8 = 0.125 g.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor that could affect this. For example, does the decay constant or any other exponential decay formula apply here? Probably not, since the half-life is given and the problem seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the exponential decay formula:\n\nN(t) = N\u2080 * e^(-\u03bbt)\n\nWhere \u03bb is the decay constant.\n\nBut since I have the half-life, I can relate \u03bb to T via \u03bb = ln(2)/T.\n\nSo, \u03bb = ln(2)/1 hour \u2248 0.693147 per hour.\n\nThen, N(3) = 1.000 * e^(-0.693147*3) = 1.000 * e^(-2.079441) \u2248 1.000 * 0.125 \u2248 0.125 g.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, it seems that 0.125 g is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider significant figures. The initial amount is given to three significant figures (1.000 g), and the half-life is given as 1 hour, which I assume is exact.\n\nSo, my calculation should be precise to three decimal places, which it is, as 0.125 g.\n\nLooking back at the options, it's listed as 0.125 g, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about it in terms of half-lives again.\n\nEach hour, the amount halves.\n\nFrom noon to 1:00 pm: 1.000 g \u2192 0.500 g\n\nFrom 1:00 pm to 2:00 pm: 0.500 g \u2192 0.250 g\n\nFrom 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm: 0.250 g \u2192 0.125 g\n\nYes, that's straightforward.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here; it's a direct application of the half-life concept.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 0.125 g.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
