                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to estimate the product of 32 and 68. Hmm, multiplying those two numbers directly might be a bit tricky, but I can use some estimation techniques to make it easier.\n\nFirst, I know that 32 is close to 30 and 68 is close to 70. So, maybe I can multiply 30 by 70 to get a rough estimate. Let's do that. 30 times 70 is 2,100. That gives me a starting point.\n\nBut, I need to check if 32 times 68 is higher or lower than 2,100. Let's see, 32 is 2 more than 30 and 68 is 2 less than 70. So, when I multiply 32 by 68, it should be slightly less than 2,100 because both numbers are a bit less than 30 and 70.\n\nWait, actually, let me think again. If I have 32 and 68, and I consider 30 and 70, multiplying 30 by 70 gives 2,100. Now, since 32 is 2 more than 30 and 68 is 2 less than 70, the product should be 2,100 minus something.\n\nLet me recall the algebraic identity for (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2. Here, a is 70 and b is 2. So, 68 times 70 would be (70 - 2)(70) = 70\u00b2 - 2*70 = 4,900 - 140 = 4,760. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 68 times 70 is 4,760, but that's not helpful for 32 times 68.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I can break down the numbers differently. How about factoring 32 as 30 + 2 and 68 as 70 - 2. So, multiplying them: (30 + 2)(70 - 2) = (30 + 2)(70) - (30 + 2)*2.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Maybe I should use the distributive property: 32 * 68 = (30 * 68) + (2 * 68).\n\nFirst, calculate 30 * 68. That's straightforward: 30 times 70 is 2,100, and 30 times -2 is -60, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, 30 times 68 is simply 30 times 70 minus 30 times 2. So, 2,100 - 60 = 2,040.\n\nThen, add 2 * 68, which is 136. So, 2,040 + 136 = 2,176. So, the exact product is 2,176.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 18 and 28\n\nB. 180 and 280\n\nC. 1,800 and 2,800\n\nD. 18,000 and 28,000\n\nI need to see which range includes 2,176.\n\nOption C is 1,800 to 2,800, which includes 2,176.\n\nOption B is 180 to 280, which is too low.\n\nOption A is 18 to 28, also too low.\n\nOption D is 18,000 to 28,000, which is too high.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 1,800 and 2,800.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to estimate quickly without calculating the exact product, I could consider that 30 times 70 is 2,100, and since both 32 and 68 are close to 30 and 70, the product should be around 2,100. So, the range of 1,800 to 2,800 would make sense.\n\nAnother way to estimate is to round 32 to 30 and 68 to 70, getting 30 * 70 = 2,100, as I did before. Then, since 32 is a bit more than 30 and 68 is a bit less than 70, the actual product might be slightly less than 2,100. But in any case, 2,176 is within the range of 1,800 to 2,800.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 1,800 and 2,800.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
