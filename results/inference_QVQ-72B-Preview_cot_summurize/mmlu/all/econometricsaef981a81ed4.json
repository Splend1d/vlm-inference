                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about hypothesis testing and significance levels. It's been a while since I've dealt with statistics, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nFirst off, the question says that a hypothesis test is conducted using a 5% significance level. I need to determine which of the given statements are correct.\n\nLet's look at statement (i): \"The significance level is equal to the size of the test.\"\n\nI remember that in hypothesis testing, the significance level, often denoted by \u03b1, is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true. This is also known as the type I error rate. The size of the test is supposed to be the maximum probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it's true, which is essentially the same as the significance level. So, I think statement (i) is correct.\n\nNext, statement (ii): \"The significance level is equal to the power of the test.\"\n\nThe power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. It's calculated as 1 minus the probability of a type II error (\u03b2). So, power = 1 - \u03b2. This is different from the significance level, which is \u03b1. Therefore, statement (ii) is not correct.\n\nNow, statement (iii): \"2.5% of the total distribution will be in each tail rejection region for a 2-sided test.\"\n\nThis seems familiar. In a two-tailed test with a significance level of 5%, the rejection regions are split into both tails of the distribution. So, each tail would have an area of 2.5% (0.025) if it's a standard normal distribution. Wait, but is this always the case?\n\nI think it depends on the distribution being used. For example, in a t-distribution, especially with small degrees of freedom, the tails can be heavier, so the areas might not exactly be 2.5% per tail. However, in practice, especially with large samples and the central limit theorem applying, the normal approximation is often used, and the tails would indeed be 2.5% each for a total of 5%. So, generally, statement (iii) is correct, though there might be exceptions in certain distributions.\n\nLastly, statement (iv): \"5% of the total distribution will be in each tail rejection region for a 2-sided test.\"\n\nThis contradicts statement (iii). If the total significance level is 5%, and it's a two-tailed test, then each tail should have half of that, which is 2.5%, not 5%. So, statement (iv) is incorrect.\n\nSo, from the above, statements (i) and (iii) are correct, while (ii) and (iv) are not.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. (ii) and (iv) only\n\nB. (i) and (iii) only\n\nC. (i), (ii), and (iii) only\n\nD. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\n\nGiven that only (i) and (iii) are correct, the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Is there any chance that (iii) could be incorrect in some scenarios?\n\nWell, in hypothesis testing, especially with normal distributions or approximations to normal, like in t-tests with large samples, the rejection regions for a two-tailed test at the 5% significance level are indeed 2.5% in each tail. So, (iii) is generally true.\n\nHowever, in some non-symmetric distributions or specific tests, maybe the split isn't exactly 2.5% per tail. But since the question seems to be referring to general hypothesis testing, and likely assuming a normal or t-distribution context, (iii) is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B: (i) and (iii) only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
