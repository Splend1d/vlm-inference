                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this problem about constructing a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of students who have their correct addresses on record. The registrar took a random sample of 150 students and used that data to build the interval. Now, I need to figure out which statement must be true about this interval.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a confidence interval is. A confidence interval gives us an estimated range of values which is likely to include an unknown population parameter, like the true proportion of students with correct addresses. The 95% confidence level means that if we were to take many, many samples and construct intervals from each sample, about 95% of those intervals would contain the true population proportion.\n\nBut wait, in this case, we're dealing with a single sample, so we're only constructing one confidence interval. So, for this one interval, what can we say about it?\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. The true proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval constructed.\n\nHmm, this seems plausible. The whole point of a confidence interval is to estimate where the true proportion lies. So, based on the sample, we're saying that we're 95% confident that the true proportion is within this interval.\n\nBut, is this necessarily true? I mean, the confidence interval is an estimate, and there's always a chance that the true proportion is not within the interval, right? The 95% confidence level means that in repeated sampling, 95% of the intervals would capture the true proportion, but for this single interval, we can't be absolutely certain.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nB. Ninety-five percent of students at this university have the correct address on record.\n\nThis seems straightforward but doesn't align with what a confidence interval represents. A confidence interval is about estimating a population parameter, not about the percentage of the population that has a certain characteristic.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The confidence interval is for the proportion, not for individual students. So, it's about estimating the true proportion of students with correct addresses, not about the percentage of students who have correct addresses.\n\nStill, this statement seems too specific. The confidence interval provides a range for the proportion, not a single value like 95%.\n\nProbably not B.\n\nC. The true proportion of students at this university with the correct addresses on record is within the confidence interval 95 percent of the time.\n\nThis sounds similar to option A but adds \"95 percent of the time.\" This seems to be getting at the repeated sampling interpretation of the confidence interval.\n\nIn frequentist statistics, a 95% confidence interval means that if we were to take many samples and construct intervals from each, 95% of those intervals would contain the true proportion. So, in that sense, over many samples, the true proportion would be within the interval 95% of the time.\n\nHowever, in this problem, we're dealing with a single sample and a single interval. So, while the procedure for constructing the interval has a 95% confidence level, meaning that the method captures the true proportion 95% of the time in repeated samples, for this specific interval, we can't make a probabilistic statement about whether it contains the true proportion or not.\n\nBecause once the sample is taken and the interval is constructed, the true proportion is either in the interval or not; there's no probability involved in that fact. The 95% refers to the reliability of the estimation procedure over many samples, not to the probability that the true proportion is in any particular interval.\n\nSo, statement C is close but not entirely accurate because it implies a probability about this specific interval, which isn't correct in frequentist terms.\n\nD. The sample proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval.\n\nWait a minute. The confidence interval is constructed to estimate the true proportion based on the sample proportion. Typically, a confidence interval for a proportion is of the form:\n\nSample proportion \u00b1 margin of error\n\nSo, the confidence interval is centered around the sample proportion, and it extends a certain number of standard errors away, based on the desired confidence level.\n\nTherefore, the sample proportion should be within the confidence interval by construction. Unless there's some unusual situation, but in standard cases, the sample proportion will always fall within its own confidence interval.\n\nSo, perhaps statement D is always true.\n\nBut let's think again. The confidence interval is meant to capture the true proportion, not the sample proportion. The sample proportion is what we observe, and the confidence interval is built around it to estimate where the true proportion might be.\n\nSo, in almost all cases, the sample proportion will be within its own confidence interval. But is this always necessarily true?\n\nI think in the standard procedure, yes, the sample proportion should always be within its own confidence interval. Unless there's some error in calculation, but assuming correct calculations, the sample proportion should be within the interval.\n\nTherefore, statement D seems to be always true.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption A says the true proportion is within the interval. That's what we're trying to estimate, and with 95% confidence, we expect that to be the case. But it's not necessarily always true; it's a statement about the interval's coverage probability.\n\nOption B is clearly incorrect because it's making a specific claim about the proportion being exactly 95%, which isn't what a confidence interval tells us.\n\nOption C is trying to convey the idea of the confidence level, but it's phrased in a way that suggests that the interval captures the true proportion 95% of the time, which, again, refers to the procedure over many samples, not to the specific interval.\n\nOption D is about the sample proportion being within the confidence interval, which, as I thought, should always be the case.\n\nTherefore, the statement that must be true is D: The sample proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
