                    "text": "Alright, I need to figure out how many digits are in a standard Visa credit card number. The options are 12, 15, 16, and 20. Hmm, I think I remember that credit card numbers can vary in length depending on the type, but I'm not sure about the exact number for Visa.\n\nLet me think about this. I know that credit cards have different lengths based on the brand. For example, American Express cards typically have 15 digits, while MasterCard and Visa often have 16 digits. But I think Visa can have different lengths too, maybe 13 or 16 digits. Wait, no, I think Visa cards are primarily 16 digits.\n\nLet me recall the structure of a credit card number. They usually follow a specific format: the first digit or two identify the card issuer, then there are account numbers, and finally a check digit at the end to verify the card's validity.\n\nI think Visa cards start with the number 4, right? And they are mostly 16 digits long. But I'm a bit unsure if there are any Visa cards with other lengths, like 12 or 20 digits.\n\nLet me consider the process of elimination. Option A is 12 digits. I know that some debit cards or smaller bank cards might have fewer digits, but I think Visa credit cards are longer than that.\n\nOption B is 15 digits. I believe that's the length of American Express cards, not Visa. So, probably not the answer.\n\nOption C is 16 digits. This seems very familiar for Visa cards. I think most Visa credit cards have 16 digits.\n\nOption D is 20 digits. That seems quite long for a credit card number. I don't recall any credit cards having 20 digits.\n\nSo, between 12, 15, 16, and 20, 16 seems like the most plausible answer for a standard Visa credit card number.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check an actual Visa card to be sure. But since I don't have one with me right now, I'll have to rely on my memory.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to think about the general structure of credit card numbers. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) sets standards for bank identification numbers (BINs), which include the initial digits that identify the card issuer.\n\nFor Visa, the BIN starts with 4, and the rest of the digits are the account number and the check digit. I think the standard length for Visa cards is indeed 16 digits, but I've also heard of some Visa debit cards being 13 digits long. However, I believe that 16 digits is the more common length for credit cards.\n\nGiven that, I would say that the correct answer is 16 digits.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think about the Luhn algorithm, which is used to validate credit card numbers. The Luhn algorithm applies to all credit card numbers, regardless of the length, so that doesn't help me here.\n\nMaybe I should consider the visual design of credit cards. Typically, credit card numbers are printed in four groups of four digits, which would make sense for a 16-digit number (4 digits x 4 groups = 16 digits). If it were 12 digits, it might be three groups of four, but I don't recall seeing that for Visa cards.\n\nAlso, when making online purchases, the input fields for credit card numbers often expect 16 digits, which aligns with the idea that Visa cards are 16 digits long.\n\nI think I've convinced myself enough that the standard Visa credit card number has 16 digits.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 16.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
