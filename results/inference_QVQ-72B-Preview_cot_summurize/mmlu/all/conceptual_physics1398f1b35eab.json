                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about two rocks falling in free fall without any air resistance. One rock is heavy, and the other is light, but they both have the same acceleration. The question is asking why the heavy rock doesn't have a greater acceleration. The options are:\n\nA. The force due to gravity is the same on each.\n\nB. Air resistance is always zero in free fall.\n\nC. The inertia of both rocks is the same.\n\nD. The ratio of force to mass is the same.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that in free fall, when there's no air resistance, the only force acting on the objects is gravity. So, for both rocks, the only force is gravity.\n\nNow, Newton's second law tells us that force equals mass times acceleration, right? So, F = ma.\n\nIn this case, the force is gravity. For Earth, the force of gravity is mg, where g is the acceleration due to gravity (about 9.8 m/s\u00b2), and m is the mass of the object.\n\nSo, for the heavy rock, which has a larger mass, the force of gravity is larger because F = mg. If m is bigger, F is bigger, since g is the same for both.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says that the heavy rock doesn't have a greater acceleration. So, even though the force is larger on the heavy rock, its acceleration is the same as the light rock's acceleration.\n\nHmm, that seems contradictory at first glance, but I know from physics that in free fall, all objects fall at the same rate regardless of their mass, assuming no air resistance.\n\nSo, maybe option A is not correct because the force due to gravity is not the same on each; the heavier rock experiences a larger force due to gravity.\n\nOption B says air resistance is always zero in free fall. Well, that's true, but it's more of a restatement of the problem conditions rather than explaining why the heavy rock doesn't have greater acceleration.\n\nOption C says the inertia of both rocks is the same. Inertia is related to mass, right? The heavier rock has more inertia because it has more mass. So, this option seems incorrect because the masses are different.\n\nOption D says the ratio of force to mass is the same. Well, according to F = ma, acceleration is F/m. If F/m is the same for both rocks, then their accelerations are the same.\n\nBut wait, F is mg, and m is mass, so mg/m = g. So, the acceleration g is the same for both, regardless of mass.\n\nSo, in other words, even though the heavy rock has a larger force acting on it (mg), it also has more mass (m), and these cancel out when calculating acceleration, leaving just g.\n\nSo, maybe option D is the correct answer.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose I have two rocks, one with mass m and the other with mass 2m.\n\nThe force on the first rock is mg, and on the second is 2mg.\n\nAccording to F = ma, the acceleration for the first rock is mg/m = g.\n\nFor the second rock, it's 2mg / 2m = g.\n\nSo, indeed, both have the same acceleration g, regardless of their masses.\n\nSo, the ratio of force to mass is the same for both, which is why their accelerations are equal.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let's double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: The force due to gravity is the same on each. Actually, no, the force is different because mass is different. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption B: Air resistance is always zero in free fall. Well, yes, that's given in the problem, but it doesn't explain why the heavy rock doesn't have greater acceleration.\n\nOption C: The inertia of both rocks is the same. No, inertia depends on mass, and masses are different.\n\nOption D: The ratio of force to mass is the same. As we've seen, this makes sense because F/m = a, and F is mg, so mg/m = g, which is constant for both.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another way to look at it. Maybe considering inertia.\n\nInertia resists changes in motion. So, the heavy rock has more inertia and is harder to accelerate. But in this case, even though there's a larger force on it, the acceleration is the same because the force and mass increase proportionally.\n\nSo, perhaps it's not just that the inertia is the same, but that the force and mass are proportional, leading to a constant acceleration.\n\nBut still, option D captures that idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to explain it.\n\nLet me think about the second law again. F = ma.\n\nIf F is proportional to m, then a is constant.\n\nIn this case, F = mg, so a = g, regardless of m.\n\nSo, yes, the acceleration is independent of mass.\n\nTherefore, the reason is that the ratio of force to mass is the same for both rocks.\n\nSo, I think option D is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect the acceleration besides mass and force.\n\nIn free fall, no air resistance, so no external forces besides gravity.\n\nTherefore, the only forces acting are gravitational, and as such, the acceleration is solely due to gravity, which is g, assuming we're close to Earth's surface.\n\nSo, yeah, I think option D is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
