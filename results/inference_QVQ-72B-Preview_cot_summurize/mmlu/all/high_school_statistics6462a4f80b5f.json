                    "text": "So I have this question about probability, and I need to figure out which statement about two events A and B is true. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that P(A \u222a B) implies events A and B are independent. Hmm, I need to recall what independence means in probability. Two events are independent if the occurrence of one doesn't affect the occurrence of the other. Mathematically, that's expressed as P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) * P(B). But option A is talking about the union, not the intersection. So, P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B). I don't see a direct connection here that would imply independence. Maybe this isn't the right one.\n\nOption B says that P(A \u222a B) = 1 implies events A and B are mutually exclusive. Mutually exclusive means that if one event happens, the other can't happen, and vice versa. In probability terms, P(A \u2229 B) = 0. So, if P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B) = 1, and if events are mutually exclusive, then P(A \u2229 B) = 0, so P(A) + P(B) = 1. But wait, P(A \u222a B) = 1 could happen even if events aren't mutually exclusive, as long as the sum of their individual probabilities minus their intersection probability equals 1. So, this doesn't necessarily imply they're mutually exclusive. Maybe not the correct choice.\n\nOption C says that P(A \u2229 B) = 0 implies events A and B are independent. Wait a minute, I think there's a confusion here. If P(A \u2229 B) = 0, that means the events are mutually exclusive, right? But independence is different. Independence requires P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) * P(B). So, if P(A \u2229 B) = 0, that would mean that P(A) * P(B) = 0, which only makes sense if at least one of P(A) or P(B) is zero. But in general, mutually exclusive events are not independent unless one of them has zero probability. So, this statement isn't generally true.\n\nOption D says that P(A \u2229 B) = 0 implies events A and B are mutually exclusive. This seems familiar. Mutually exclusive events are defined by P(A \u2229 B) = 0. So, if the probability of both A and B happening together is zero, then they can't both happen at the same time. That sounds correct.\n\nLet me double-check. Suppose A and B are two events in a sample space. If P(A \u2229 B) = 0, that means there's zero chance of both A and B occurring simultaneously. This is the definition of mutually exclusive events. So, this seems to hold true.\n\nOn the other hand, independence requires P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) * P(B). So, if P(A \u2229 B) = 0, then for independence, P(A) * P(B) should also be zero, which would only happen if P(A) = 0 or P(B) = 0. But mutually exclusive doesn't imply that; it just means they don't overlap.\n\nTherefore, option D is correct, while option C is incorrect because P(A \u2229 B) = 0 implies mutual exclusivity, not independence, unless one of the events has zero probability.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. P(A \u2229 B) = 0 implies events A and B are mutually exclusive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
