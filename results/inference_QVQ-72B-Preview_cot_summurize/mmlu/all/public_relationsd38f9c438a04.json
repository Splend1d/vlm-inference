                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of these types of survey question seeks qualitative information? A. Likert scale, B. Multiple choice, C. Open-ended, D. Yes/No.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these is used for qualitative information.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what qualitative information is. Qualitative data is about descriptions or qualities, right? It's not numerical; it's more about opinions, feelings, or detailed responses that can provide deeper insights into a topic. So, in a survey, a question that allows people to express their thoughts freely would likely be the one that captures qualitative information.\n\nLet me look at each option:\n\nA. Likert scale: I know that a Likert scale is a type of rating scale where respondents indicate their agreement or disagreement with a statement. For example, they might choose from Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly Disagree. This seems pretty structured and gives numerical values to opinions, which might be more quantitative than qualitative.\n\nB. Multiple choice: This is when you provide a set of predefined answers, and the respondent picks one or more options. It's straightforward and easy to analyze because it's categorical data. Again, this seems more quantitative since it's about selecting from given choices rather than providing detailed responses.\n\nC. Open-ended: This type of question doesn't provide any options; instead, it asks respondents to answer in their own words. It could be a sentence, a paragraph, or even just a single word. Open-ended questions allow for a wide range of responses and can capture nuances and details that closed-ended questions might miss. This seems like it would capture qualitative data because it's collecting descriptive information directly from the respondents.\n\nD. Yes/No: These questions require a simple binary answer\u2014yes or no. They're easy to answer and analyze, but they don't provide much detail. This is definitely quantitative data, as it can be easily counted and categorized.\n\nFrom this analysis, it seems like the open-ended question (option C) is the one that seeks qualitative information. It allows respondents to provide detailed answers that can offer deeper insights into their thoughts and feelings about the topic being surveyed.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think about an example. Suppose I'm conducting a survey on customer satisfaction with a particular product. If I use a Likert scale, like asking how much they agree with the statement \"I am satisfied with the product,\" I'd get a range of responses from strongly agree to strongly disagree, which is quantitative data indicating their level of satisfaction.\n\nIf I use a multiple-choice question, like \"What is your favorite feature of the product?\" with options A, B, or C, I'd get categorical data that I can count and analyze statistically.\n\nWith a yes/no question, like \"Would you recommend this product to a friend?\" I'd get a binary response, which is also quantitative.\n\nBut if I use an open-ended question, like \"What do you think about the product?\" or \"Please describe your experience with the product,\" I'd get detailed answers that could include their likes, dislikes, suggestions, and personal stories. This kind of information is qualitative and can provide valuable insights into customer perceptions that numbers alone might not capture.\n\nSo, based on this, the correct answer should be C. Open-ended.\n\nWait a minute, could the Likert scale also be considered qualitative in some contexts? I've heard that Likert scales can be used to measure attitudes and opinions, which are qualitative in nature, but then again, the responses are quantified into numerical values for analysis.\n\nLet me do a quick search to confirm. Oh, according to various sources, Likert scales are actually used to collect quantitative data because the responses are assigned numbers, allowing for statistical analysis. However, some researchers might use them to understand qualitative concepts like attitudes or opinions.\n\nBut in the context of this question, which is asking directly about the type of question that seeks qualitative information, the open-ended question seems the most appropriate choice.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the depth of information obtained. Open-ended questions can elicit detailed and nuanced responses that reflect the respondent's personal views, feelings, and experiences, which are hallmarksof qualitative data.\n\nIn contrast, multiple-choice and yes/no questions provide structured responses that are easier to quantify and analyze statistically, making them more suitable for collecting quantitative data.\n\nThe Likert scale, while it measures opinions or agreements, still provides quantitative data because the responses are ordinally scaled and can be summed or averaged.\n\nTherefore, the best answer to the question is C. Open-ended.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any possibility that another option could also be considered qualitative. For instance, sometimes, multiple-choice questions with write-in options can collect some qualitative data, but in general, multiple-choice is still considered quantitative because the responses are predefined.\n\nYes/No questions are definitely quantitative, as they provide binary data.\n\nSo, no, none of the other options typically seek qualitative information in the way that open-ended questions do.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer is clearly C. Open-ended.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Open-ended}} \\]"
