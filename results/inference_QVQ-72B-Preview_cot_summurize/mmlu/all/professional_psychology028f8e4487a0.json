                    "text": "So I have this question about hypnotic induction, and I need to pick the most accurate statement from the options provided. Let me see what they are:\n\nA. is harmful to many clients\n\nB. allows the therapist to control the client\u2019s behavior\n\nC. can be terminated by the client\n\nD. works better with less intelligent clients\n\nHmm, I'm not an expert on hypnosis, but I think I have some basic knowledge about it. Hypnotic induction is like putting someone into a trance-like state, right? But let's think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A says it's harmful to many clients. I've heard mixed things about hypnosis. Some people say it can be therapeutic and helpful for certain issues like anxiety or phobias, while others might have had negative experiences. But I don't know if it's harmful to many clients. Maybe it's not suitable for everyone, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's harmful.\n\nOption B says it allows the therapist to control the client's behavior. That sounds a bit scary. I thought that in hypnosis, people are still in control of their own actions and can't be made to do something they don't want to do. Like, you can't be hypnotized to rob a bank or something. So, probably not true.\n\nOption C says it can be terminated by the client. That makes sense. I think hypnosis relies on the client's willingness to be in that state. If they decide they want to snap out of it, they should be able to. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption D says it works better with less intelligent clients. That doesn't sound right. I would think that hypnosis might work better with people who can focus well and have a strong imagination, but I don't recall intelligence being a factor. Maybe the opposite, but not less intelligent.\n\nLet me see. Between the options, C seems the most accurate based on what I know. But just to be sure, maybe I should look it up or recall if there's any specific information about this.\n\nI remember that hypnosis is a collaborative process between the therapist and the client. The client has to agree to be hypnotized and can terminate the session at any time if they feel uncomfortable. So, that aligns with option C.\n\nOption A suggests that it's harmful to many clients, but from what I know, hypnosis is generally considered safe for most people when conducted by a trained professional. There might be some risks for people with certain mental health conditions, but it's not harmful to many clients in a general sense.\n\nOption B seems misleading because hypnosis doesn't give the therapist control over the client's behavior. The client is aware and in control, even if they're in a trance-like state. They can refuse suggestions if they don't align with their values or desires.\n\nOption D is interesting. I've heard that suggestibility is more related to how well hypnosis works, not necessarily intelligence. Some studies might have found correlations with certain personality traits, but not specifically with lower intelligence.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option C seems to be the most accurate statement about hypnotic induction\u2014that it can be terminated by the client. It's important to remember that hypnosis is a voluntary state, and clients have agency throughout the process.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
