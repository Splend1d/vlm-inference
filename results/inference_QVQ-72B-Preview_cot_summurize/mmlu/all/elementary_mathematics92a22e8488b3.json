                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem: \"What is the value of 4x + 9, when x = 4?\" And there are some multiple-choice options: A. 13, B. 17, C. 25, D. 52. Okay, I need to find out which one of these is correct.\n\nSo, I have the expression 4x + 9, and x is equal to 4. I think I just need to plug in the value of x into the expression and calculate it. Let's write that down.\n\nSo, 4x + 9, with x = 4.\n\nThat should be 4*4 + 9.\n\nLet me calculate 4 times 4. That's 16.\n\nThen add 9 to it. 16 + 9.\n\nLet's see, 16 plus 9 is 25.\n\nSo, the answer should be 25.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I substituted x with 4 in the expression 4x + 9, which gives me 4*4 + 9.\n\nThen, I calculated 4*4, which is indeed 16.\n\nNext, I added 9 to 16, which is 25.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 13\n\nB. 17\n\nC. 25\n\nD. 52\n\nSo, 25 is option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nIs there any possibility of misinterpretation? For example, maybe the expression is not 4x + 9 but something else? No, it looks clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different value of x? No, the problem specifies x = 4.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if there are any units or additional context that might affect the answer, but since it's just an algebraic expression, I think it's straightforward.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the expression is part of a larger equation, but no, it's just an expression to evaluate.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The answer should simply be 25.\n\nLet me try plugging in the value again to confirm.\n\n4x + 9, with x = 4.\n\nSo, 4*4 is 16.\n\nThen, 16 + 9 is 25.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nMaybe I can also think about the order of operations. In this case, multiplication comes before addition, so it's correct to multiply 4 and 4 first and then add 9.\n\nIs there any way this could be interpreted differently? For example, if there were parentheses or exponents involved, but no, the expression is straightforward.\n\nI think I've confirmed enough times that the answer is 25.\n\nSo, the correct choice is C. 25.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check the other options quickly.\n\nOption A is 13, which is less than 25, and doesn't seem to relate directly to the expression.\n\nOption B is 17, which might be a mistake or another interpretation, but based on my calculations, it's not correct.\n\nOption D is 52, which is more than double 25, so that doesn't seem right either.\n\nTherefore, the only logical answer is C. 25.\n\nI think I'm confident with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
