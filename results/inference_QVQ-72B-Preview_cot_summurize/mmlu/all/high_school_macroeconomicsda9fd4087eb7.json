                    "text": "So I came across this term \"ceteris paribus\" in my economics class, and I need to figure out what it means. The options are:\n\nA. Is Greek for \"never changing.\"\n\nB. Means anything can change at any time.\n\nC. Is Latin for \"everything else remains constant.\"\n\nD. Means \"when in equilibrium.\"\n\nFirst off, I know that \"ceteris paribus\" is a common phrase used in economics, but I'm not sure about its exact meaning. Let me break it down.\n\nI recall that \"ceteris\" sounds like it might be related to \"other things,\" and \"paribus\" seems similar to \"parum,\" which means \"equal\" or \"the same\" in Latin. So, putting that together, it probably means \"other things being equal\" or \"all else equal.\"\n\nLooking at option C, it says \"is Latin for 'everything else remains constant.'\" That seems very close to what I just thought. \"Everything else remains constant\" is essentially the same as \"other things being equal.\"\n\nOption A says it's Greek for \"never changing.\" Wait, but I thought it was Latin, not Greek. Also, \"never changing\" seems too absolute. In economics, ceteris paribus is used to make assumptions about other variables staying constant for the purpose of analysis, but it's not about things never changing in general.\n\nOption B says it means \"anything can change at any time.\" That seems contradictory to what I understand about ceteris paribus. If anything can change anytime, then it's not holding other variables constant, which is the opposite of ceteris paribus.\n\nOption D says it means \"when in equilibrium.\" Equilibrium in economics refers to a state where supply and demand are balanced. While ceteris paribus is often used when analyzing equilibrium, it's not the same thing. Equilibrium is a specific condition, whereas ceteris paribus is a general assumption about other variables not changing during analysis.\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, option C seems to be the correct answer. Let me double-check.\n\nI remember that in the law of demand, we say that as price increases, quantity demanded decreases, ceteris paribus. That means, assuming nothing else changes, like incomes or preferences, which could also affect demand.\n\nSimilarly, in the production function, we might look at how output changes with labor, assuming capital is held constant, which is again a ceteris paribus assumption.\n\nSo, yes, it's about holding other relevant variables constant while examining the relationship between two variables.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer: ceteris paribus is Latin for \"everything else remains constant.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
