Cranial and spinal\n\nC. Thoracic and abdominal\n\nD. Pericardial and pleural\n\nHmm, I need to recall what the diaphragm is and where it's located in the body.\n\nI know that the diaphragm is a muscle that sits at the base of the chest and separates the abdomen from the chest. So, it divides two cavities: the thoracic cavity and the abdominal cavity.\n\nLet me just double-check that.\n\nThe thoracic cavity contains organs like the heart and lungs, and the abdominal cavity holds organs like the stomach, intestines, and liver. The diaphragm is the muscle that contracts and expands to help with breathing, and it's located between these two cavities.\n\nSo, option C. Thoracic and abdominal seems correct.\n\nBut let's look at the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A. Abdominal and pelvic cavities. I know that the pelvic cavity is part of the lower abdomen and contains organs like the bladder and reproductive organs. So, it's actually part of the abdominal cavity, not separately divided by the diaphragm.\n\nOption B. Cranial and spinal cavities. The cranial cavity is where the brain is, and the spinal cavity contains the spinal cord. These are both parts of the neural axis and are connected through the foramen magnum at the base of the skull. The diaphragm doesn't separate these cavities.\n\nOption D. Pericardial and pleural cavities. The pericardial cavity surrounds the heart, and the pleural cavities surround the lungs. Both of these are within the thoracic cavity. The diaphragm separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity, but within the thoracic cavity, the pericardial and pleural cavities are not separated by the diaphragm from each other; they're separated by other structures.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option C. Thoracic and abdominal is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that the diaphragm could be considered as separating other cavities indirectly?\n\nWell, maybe in some contexts, but I think the most straightforward answer is that the diaphragm separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this.\n\nPerhaps considering the pericardial and pleural cavities in relation to the diaphragm. The pericardial cavity is inferior to the pleural cavities within the thoracic cavity, but again, the diaphragm is below the thoracic cavity, separating it from the abdominal cavity.\n\nSo, no, I don't think the diaphragm separates the pericardial and pleural cavities directly.\n\nWhat about the abdominal and pelvic cavities? Well, the pelvic cavity is indeed part of the abdominal cavity, and it's not separated by the diaphragm. The diaphragm is higher up, separating the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity as a whole.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The correct answer is C. Thoracic and abdominal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
