                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about calculating the radiation force exerted on a completely reflecting surface due to solar flux. The solar flux at Earth's surface is given as 1,000 W/m\u00b2, and the surface area in question is 3 m\u00b2. The sunlight is normal to the surface, meaning it hits the surface at a 90-degree angle, which is important for calculating the force.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula that relates solar flux to radiation pressure or force. I know that when electromagnetic radiation like sunlight hits a surface, it exerts a pressure on that surface. The exact amount depends on whether the surface absorbs, reflects, or transmits the radiation. In this case, the surface is completely reflecting, meaning none of the radiation is absorbed or transmitted; it's all reflected.\n\nI remember that the radiation pressure \\(p\\) on a perfectly reflecting surface is given by \\(p = \\frac{2S}{c}\\), where \\(S\\) is the solar flux (or intensity) in W/m\u00b2, and \\(c\\) is the speed of light in a vacuum. The factor of 2 comes from the fact that the radiation is being completely reflected, not absorbed.\n\nSo, plugging in the values I have:\n\n\\[p = \\frac{2 \\times 1000 \\, \\text{W/m}^2}{3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}} = \\frac{2000}{3 \\times 10^8} = \\frac{2000}{300000000} = \\frac{2}{300000} = \\frac{1}{150000} \\, \\text{N/m}^2\\]\n\nBut wait, pressure is force per unit area, so to find the total force, I need to multiply the pressure by the area:\n\n\\[F = p \\times A = \\frac{1}{150000} \\, \\text{N/m}^2 \\times 3 \\, \\text{m}^2 = \\frac{3}{150000} \\, \\text{N} = \\frac{1}{50000} \\, \\text{N}\\]\n\nConverting that to scientific notation:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{50000} \\, \\text{N} = 2 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{N}\\]\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 2 x 10^-6 N\n\nB. 1 x 10^-5 N\n\nC. 2 x 10^-5 N\n\nD. 3 N\n\nSo, the closest option is C. 2 x 10^-5 N.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the radiation pressure formula: \\(p = \\frac{2S}{c}\\)\n\nGiven \\(S = 1000 \\, \\text{W/m}^2\\), \\(c = 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[p = \\frac{2 \\times 1000}{3 \\times 10^8} = \\frac{2000}{300000000} = \\frac{2000 \\div 1000}{300000000 \\div 1000} = \\frac{2}{300000} = \\frac{1}{150000} \\, \\text{N/m}^2\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[F = p \\times A = \\frac{1}{150000} \\times 3 = \\frac{3}{150000} = \\frac{1}{50000} \\, \\text{N}\\]\n\nConverting to scientific notation:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{50000} = 2 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{N}\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be C. 2 x 10^-5 N.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the force due to radiation pressure on a flat surface:\n\n\\[F = \\frac{2IA}{c}\\]\n\nWhere \\(I\\) is the intensity of the radiation, \\(A\\) is the area, and \\(c\\) is the speed of light. This seems similar to what I used earlier.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[F = \\frac{2 \\times 1000 \\, \\text{W/m}^2 \\times 3 \\, \\text{m}^2}{3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}} = \\frac{6000}{3 \\times 10^8} = \\frac{6000}{300000000} = \\frac{6000 \\div 1000}{300000000 \\div 1000} = \\frac{6}{300} = \\frac{1}{50} \\, \\text{N}\\]\n\nWait a minute, that gives me \\(\\frac{1}{50} \\, \\text{N} = 0.02 \\, \\text{N}\\), which is \\(2 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\text{N}\\), but that's not matching my previous calculation.\n\nHmm, there must be something wrong here. Let me check the units.\n\nIntensity \\(I\\) is in W/m\u00b2, area \\(A\\) is in m\u00b2, speed of light \\(c\\) is in m/s.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[F = \\frac{2 \\times (\\text{W/m}^2) \\times \\text{m}^2}{\\text{m/s}} = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{W}}{\\text{m/s}} = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{J/s}}{\\text{m/s}} = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{J}}{\\text{m}} = 2 \\times \\text{N}\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the units aren't cancelling out correctly. Maybe I'm misremembering the formula.\n\nLet me look up the correct formula for radiation pressure force.\n\nUpon checking, the force due to radiation pressure on a perfectly reflecting surface is indeed \\(F = \\frac{2IA}{c}\\), where \\(I\\) is the intensity, \\(A\\) is the area, and \\(c\\) is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that, my earlier calculation should be correct:\n\n\\[F = \\frac{2 \\times 1000 \\times 3}{3 \\times 10^8} = \\frac{6000}{3 \\times 10^8} = 2 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{N}\\]\n\nAh, I see where I went wrong in my first attempt at cross-verification. I must have miscalculated the denominator earlier.\n\nSo, confirming again, the correct force is \\(2 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{N}\\), which corresponds to option C.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let me consider the physical principles involved. When light is reflected off a surface, it exerts a force due to the change in momentum of the photons. For a perfectly reflecting surface, each photon's momentum is reversed, resulting in twice the force compared to a perfectly absorbing surface.\n\nGiven that, the formula \\(F = \\frac{2IA}{c}\\) seems appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of radiation pressure \\(p = \\frac{2I}{c}\\) and then \\(F = pA\\), which is essentially the same as the above formula.\n\nEither way, I arrive at the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. 2 x 10^-5 N.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
