                    "text": "So I have this question here about greedy algorithms and which of these problems can be solved using a standard greedy algorithm. The options are:\n\nI. Finding a minimum spanning tree in an undirected graph with positive-integer edge weights\n\nII. Finding a maximum clique in an undirected graph\n\nIII. Finding a maximum flow from a source node to a sink node in a directed graph with positive-integer edge capacities\n\nAnd the options for the answer are:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. II only\n\nC. III only\n\nD. I and II only\n\nAlright, let's tackle this one by one.\n\nFirst, minimum spanning tree. I remember that a minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of a graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles, and with the minimum possible total edge weight. So, for an undirected graph with positive-integer edge weights, can we use a greedy algorithm to find the MST?\n\nYes, definitely. There are two famous greedy algorithms for finding the MST: Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm.\n\nIn Kruskal's algorithm, you sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights. Then, you iterate through each edge and add it to the growing spanning tree if it doesn't form a cycle with the edges already in the tree. This ensures that at each step, you're adding the next least-weight edge that doesn't complete a cycle, leading to the overall minimum spanning tree.\n\nPrim's algorithm, on the other hand, starts from an arbitrary vertex and grows the MST one vertex at a time. It maintains a set of vertices included in the MST and repeatedly selects the minimum-weight edge that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside of it. This process is also greedy because it always chooses the next best edge without considering future consequences.\n\nSo, for problem I, a standard greedy algorithm can indeed solve it.\n\nNow, moving on to problem II: finding a maximum clique in an undirected graph.\n\nA clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. The maximum clique is the largest such subset.\n\nIs there a standard greedy algorithm that can solve this problem?\n\nWell, I know that the clique problem is NP-complete, which means that there is no known polynomial-time algorithm for solving it, and greedy algorithms typically don't guarantee optimal solutions for NP-complete problems.\n\nIn fact, greedy approaches for finding a maximum clique often involve heuristics, such as always choosing the vertex with the highest degree and then removing it along with its neighbors, but these methods don't always find the maximum clique.\n\nThere are exact algorithms for finding the maximum clique, but they are not greedy and can be computationally intensive for large graphs.\n\nTherefore, there isn't a standard greedy algorithm that can solve the maximum clique problem optimally.\n\nSo, for problem II, the answer is no.\n\nLastly, problem III: finding a maximum flow from a source node to a sink node in a directed graph with positive-integer edge capacities.\n\nThe maximum flow problem involves finding the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from a source node to a sink node in a directed graph where each edge has a capacity.\n\nNow, are there standard greedy algorithms for finding the maximum flow?\n\nI recall that the Ford-Fulkerson method is a well-known algorithm for finding the maximum flow. It involves repeatedly finding augmenting paths from the source to the sink and increasing the flow along these paths until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nHowever, the Ford-Fulkerson method isn't strictly greedy because it doesn't always choose the best possible path at each step. In particular, it can get stuck in infinite loops if not implemented carefully, especially with irrational capacities, though in this case, we have positive integers.\n\nMoreover, there are more efficient algorithms like the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, which is a variation of Ford-Fulkerson that always picks the shortest augmenting path (in terms of the number of edges), ensuring termination in a finite number of steps.\n\nBut again, these algorithms aren't greedy in the sense that they make the best choice at each step without considering future steps.\n\nThere are also other algorithms like the push-relabel method, which maintain preflows and push flow along residual edges, but again, these aren't greedy algorithms.\n\nSo, for problem III, while there are efficient algorithms to find the maximum flow, none of them are standard greedy algorithms.\n\nTherefore, only problem I can be solved by a standard greedy algorithm.\n\nHence, the correct answer should be A. I only.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check. Is there any chance that a greedy approach could somehow work for maximum clique or maximum flow?\n\nFor maximum clique, as I said earlier, it's NP-complete, and greedy heuristics don't guarantee optimal solutions. So, no, there isn't a standard greedy algorithm that can solve it optimally.\n\nFor maximum flow, the algorithms like Ford-Fulkerson and Edmonds-Karp are not greedy; they involve iterative improvements and may not always make the locally optimal choice.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion stands: only problem I can be solved by a standard greedy algorithm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
