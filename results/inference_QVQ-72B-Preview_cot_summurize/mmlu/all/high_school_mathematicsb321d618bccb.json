                    "text": "So I've got this problem about amoebas splitting. Let's see what it's asking. There's one amoeba placed in a puddle on day one, and it splits into two amoebas that same day. Then, each of those new amoebas splits into two more the next day, and this keeps going every day for a week. I need to figure out how many amoebas there are after one week. Assuming there are no amoebas in the puddle before the first one is placed.\n\nOkay, let's try to understand this step by step. It sounds like each amoeba splits into two new amoebas every day. So, starting with one amoeba on day one, it splits into two on the same day. So, by the end of day one, there are two amoebas.\n\nThen, on day two, each of those two amoebas splits into two more amoebas. So, that would be 2 amoebas becoming 4. So, by the end of day two, there are four amoebas.\n\nOn day three, each of those four amoebas splits into two more. So, 4 amoebas become 8. So, by the end of day three, there are eight amoebas.\n\nI'm starting to see a pattern here. Each day, the number of amoebas doubles from the previous day.\n\nLet me list out the number of amoebas each day:\n\n- Day 1: 2 amoebas\n\n- Day 2: 4 amoebas\n\n- Day 3: 8 amoebas\n\n- Day 4: 16 amoebas\n\n- Day 5: 32 amoebas\n\n- Day 6: 64 amoebas\n\n- Day 7: 128 amoebas\n\nWait, but let's make sure this makes sense. The problem says that on the same day the amoeba splits into two. So, does that mean that on day one, starting with one amoeba, it splits into two by the end of day one. Then, on day two, each of those two splits into two again, and so on.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, by day seven, there would be 128 amoebas.\n\nBut let me think if there's a formula for this. It looks like exponential growth, where each day the number of amoebas doubles.\n\nSo, if I start with one amoeba on day zero, but according to the problem, day one starts with one amoeba, which splits into two by the end of the day.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says \"on that same day it splits into two amoebas.\" So, does that mean that on the day it splits, or at the end of the day?\n\nI think it's at the end of the day, the amoeba splits into two. So, starting with one amoeba at the beginning of day one, by the end of day one, it has split into two.\n\nThen, on day two, those two amoebas each split into two by the end of day two, resulting in four amoebas.\n\nContinuing this pattern:\n\n- Day 1: 2^1 = 2 amoebas\n\n- Day 2: 2^2 = 4 amoebas\n\n- Day 3: 2^3 = 8 amoebas\n\n- Day 4: 2^4 = 16 amoebas\n\n- Day 5: 2^5 = 32 amoebas\n\n- Day 6: 2^6 = 64 amoebas\n\n- Day 7: 2^7 = 128 amoebas\n\nSo, after one week (7 days), there are 128 amoebas.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nIs there any compounding effect or anything else happening? The problem seems straightforward: each amoeba splits into two new amoebas every day, and this happens at the end of each day.\n\nSo, yes, each day, the number of amoebas doubles from the previous day's end.\n\nTherefore, after 7 days, it should be 2^7 = 128 amoebas.\n\nBut let's consider if the splitting happens at the end of the day, and if the newly formed amoebas can split the same day.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"on that same day it splits into two amoebas.\" So, does that mean that on the day it is born, it splits into two?\n\nWait, no, it's placed on day one, and on that same day it splits into two. So, it's splitting at the end of the day.\n\nSimilarly, the new amoebas split at the end of their respective days.\n\nSo, no, they don't split the same day they are born.\n\nWait, but if an amoeba splits at the end of day one, producing two amoebas, and then on day two, those two amoebas each split into two by the end of day two, and so on.\n\nYes, that's consistent with the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, after day one: 2\n\nDay two: 4\n\nDay three: 8\n\nDay four: 16\n\nDay five: 32\n\nDay six: 64\n\nDay seven: 128\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 128.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 256\n\nB. 1024\n\nC. 64\n\nD. 128\n\nSo, option D seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the amoebas are splitting at the beginning or end of the day.\n\nThe problem says \"on that same day it splits into two amoebas.\" So, it's splitting at the end of the day.\n\nTherefore, yes, 2^7 = 128.\n\nAlternatively, if the splitting happened at the beginning of each day, but that would change things.\n\nBut according to the problem, it's at the end of the day.\n\nSo, I think 128 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{128} \\]"
