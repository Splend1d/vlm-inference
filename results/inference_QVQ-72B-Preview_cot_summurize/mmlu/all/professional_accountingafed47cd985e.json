                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this problem about a stock dividend, and I need to figure out which adjustment to make when recording it. The company's stock is trading at $10 per share, and there are 1,000 shares of $1 par value outstanding. The board has declared a 30% common stock dividend. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a stock dividend is. From what I remember, a stock dividend is when a company distributes additional shares of its existing stock to its current shareholders, usually based on the number of shares they already own. So, in this case, the company is declaring a 30% stock dividend, which means that for every share a shareholder owns, they'll receive an additional 0.30 shares.\n\nSo, if there are 1,000 shares outstanding, a 30% stock dividend would result in 300 new shares being issued (1,000 shares * 30% = 300 shares). These new shares are additional to the existing shares, and they don't require the shareholders to pay anything extra; it's just distributing some of the company's retained earnings or other equity accounts to shareholders in the form of more shares.\n\nNow, I need to record this transaction. But before I jump into the journal entry, I should understand how a stock dividend affects the equity accounts of the company.\n\nLet's recall that equity consists of several components:\n\n1. Common Stock: This is the par value of all issued shares.\n\n2. Additional Paid-In Capital: This is the amount received in excess of the par value when shares are issued.\n\n3. Retained Earnings: This is the accumulated profits of the company, minus any dividends paid.\n\n4. Treasury Stock: This is the cost of shares repurchased by the company.\n\nIn this problem, we have common stock with a $1 par value, and the market price is $10 per share. So, the par value is $1, and the additional paid-in capital per share is $9 ($10 - $1).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total par value of the new shares issued as part of the stock dividend. Since 300 new shares are being issued with a $1 par value, the total par value is 300 shares * $1 = $300.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how much to credit to additional paid-in capital or retained earnings. One common approach is to record the stock dividend at the market value of the shares distributed.\n\nSo, the market value of the 300 new shares is 300 shares * $10 = $3,000.\n\nTherefore, the total debit to retained earnings would be the market value of the shares distributed, which is $3,000.\n\nOn the credit side:\n\n- Common stock is credited for the par value of the new shares, which is $300.\n\n- Additional paid-in capital is credited for the difference between the market value and the par value, which is $3,000 - $300 = $2,700.\n\nWait a minute, that seems familiar. Let me check the options again:\n\nA. Treasury stock is debited for $300.\n\nB. Additional paid-in capital is credited for $2,700.\n\nC. Retained earnings is debited for $300.\n\nD. Common stock is debited for $3,000.\n\nBased on my calculations, the retained earnings should be debited for $3,000 (the market value of the shares distributed), not $300. So option C seems incorrect.\n\nOption A suggests debiting treasury stock for $300. But in this scenario, the company is issuing new shares, not repurchasing them, so there shouldn't be a debit to treasury stock. Maybe if the company had treasury shares, but the problem doesn't mention that.\n\nOption D says common stock is debited for $3,000. But common stock should be credited for the par value of the new shares issued, which is $300, not debited for $3,000.\n\nOption B says additional paid-in capital is credited for $2,700. That aligns with my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at this differently. Perhaps in some jurisdictions or accounting standards, the treatment differs.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Maybe the stock dividend is being recorded at par value rather than market value.\n\nIf I record the stock dividend at par value, then the total amount would be $300 (300 shares * $1 par value). In that case, retained earnings would be debited for $300, and common stock would be credited for $300. But this approach doesn't account for the market value of the shares, which is higher than the par value.\n\nI think the more accepted practice is to record stock dividends at market value, especially if the market value is significantly different from par value.\n\nLet me see what my textbook says about this. Oh, here it is:\n\n\"When a stock dividend is declared, the retained earnings are reduced by the market value of the shares distributed, and the common stock and additional paid-in capital are increased by the par value and the excess over par value, respectively.\"\n\nSo, in this case, retained earnings are debited for $3,000 (market value of 300 shares at $10 each), common stock is credited for $300 (par value of new shares), and additional paid-in capital is credited for $2,700 ($3,000 - $300).\n\nTherefore, the correct option should be B. Additional paid-in capital is credited for $2,700.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"which of the following adjustments should be made,\" and it's likely referring to one specific journal entry line, but in reality, multiple entries are needed.\n\nHowever, based on the options provided, B seems to be the correct choice among the given alternatives.\n\nLet me double-check. If I choose B, I'm saying that additional paid-in capital is credited for $2,700, which aligns with the difference between the market value and the par value of the new shares issued.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no treasury stock involved in this transaction.\n\nOption C is incorrect because retained earnings should be debited for the full market value, which is $3,000, not $300.\n\nOption D is incorrect because common stock should be credited for $300, not debited for $3,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Additional paid-in capital is credited for $2,700.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
