                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about Moore's most fundamental question in ethics. The options are:\n\nA. whether life is worth living.\n\nB. whether God exists.\n\nC. how \"good\" is to be defined.\n\nD. whether morality is objective.\n\nI need to pick which one Moore would consider the most fundamental.\n\nFirst, I should probably know a bit about Moore. I recall that G.E. Moore was an ethical philosopher, famous for his work in meta-ethics, especially his principle of intuitionism and his \"open question argument.\"\n\nHis book \"Principia Ethica\" is pretty influential in ethical theory. In that book, he discusses the nature of goodness and moral properties.\n\nSo, considering that, option C seems relevant because Moore did spend a lot of time discussing the definition of \"good.\"\n\nBut let's think about each option:\n\nOption A: Whether life is worth living.\n\nThat's a big question, for sure, but is it the most fundamental in ethics? Ethics is often concerned with how we should live, but the worthiness of life seems more existential or philosophical in a different way, maybe more related to meaning in life rather than specifically ethical principles.\n\nOption B: Whether God exists.\n\nThis is another big question, central to theology and philosophy of religion. While it does intersect with ethics\u2014especially in religious ethics\u2014it's not uniquely ethical. Moore was more known for his work in meta-ethics, which is about the nature of moral statements themselves, not necessarily about the existence of God.\n\nOption C: How \"good\" is to be defined.\n\nThis seems very much in line with Moore's concerns. In \"Principia Ethica,\" he argues that \"good\" is a simple, indefinable quality\u2014that it's a non-natural property that can't be reduced to natural properties. He uses the \"open question argument\" to support this, suggesting that any definition of good can be questioned, implying that \"good\" remains an open concept.\n\nSo, this seems like a strong candidate for Moore's most fundamental question in ethics.\n\nOption D: Whether morality is objective.\n\nThis is also a central question in meta-ethics. Moore did contribute to this discussion; for instance, he believed in moral realism, the idea that moral truths exist independently of human opinion. However, his primary fame is for his intuitionism and his definition (or rather, non-definition) of \"good.\"\n\nSo, between options C and D, I need to decide which one Moore would consider more fundamental.\n\nPerhaps both are fundamental, but if I have to choose one, I'd go with option C, because defining \"good\" seems to be a prerequisite for discussing whether morality is objective.\n\nIf we don't know what \"good\" is, how can we determine if it's objective?\n\nMoreover, Moore's intuitionism suggests that we have an intuitive grasp of what is good, which implies that \"good\" is a fundamental concept that can't be defined in terms of other concepts.\n\nTherefore, the question of how \"good\" is defined is at the heart of his ethical theory.\n\nSo, my answer is C. how \"good\" is to be defined.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
