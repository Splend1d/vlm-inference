                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question about a speech from 1898 by Albert J. Beveridge, titled \"The March of the Flag.\" It seems to be about the idea of the United States governing other countries, especially places like the Philippines, which it had recently acquired. The question is asking which rationale Beveridge uses in his argument, and there are four options. Let me read the speech excerpt again to understand his point.\n\nHe says, \"The Opposition tells us that we ought not to govern a people without their consent. I answer, the rule of liberty that all just government derives its authority from the consent of the governed, applies only to those who are capable of self-government.\" So, he's responding to critics who say you need consent to govern someone. His response is that this principle only applies to people who can govern themselves. He then gives examples: \"We govern the Indians without their consent, we govern our territories without their consent, we govern our children without their consent.\" So, he's extending this idea beyond just the Philippines to other groups and places under U.S. control.\n\nNext, he asks, \"How do they know that our government would be without their consent? Would not the people of the Philippines prefer the just, human, civilizing government of this Republic to the savage, bloody rule of pillage and extortion from which we have rescued them?\" Here, he's suggesting that even if there isn't explicit consent, the Philippines might prefer American rule over what they had before, implying that it's better for them.\n\nThen, he brings up the idea of duty to the world: \"And, regardless of this formula of words made only for enlightened, self-governing people, do we owe no duty to the world? Shall we turn these peoples back to the reeking hands from which we have taken them? Shall we abandon them, with Germany, England, Japan, hungering for them? Shall we save them from those nations, to give them a self-rule of tragedy?\" So, he's arguing that the U.S. has a responsibility not just to the Philippines but to the wider world, perhaps suggesting that other countries might treat them worse.\n\nFinally, he concludes: \"Then, like men and not like children, let us on to our tasks, our mission, and our destiny.\" This seems to be a call to action, encouraging Americans to embrace their role as a global power.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. The closing of the western frontier impels the United States to expand its territory overseas.\n\nI don't see much in this excerpt about the western frontier being closed. This might be a reference to Frederick Jackson Turner's thesis about the frontier, but it's not directly addressed here. So, probably not the main rationale in this speech.\n\nB. Governing territories confers economic benefits to both European and nonwhite nations.\n\nThe speech mentions other European powers like Germany and England, but it doesn't explicitly say that governing territories brings economic benefits to nonwhite nations. It seems more focused on the moral aspect of governance rather than economic benefits.\n\nC. Powerful nations have a moral duty to govern less developed nations.\n\nThis seems to align closely with what Beveridge is saying. He talks about the U.S. having a duty to the world, and that governing the Philippines is part of their \"mission and destiny.\" It sounds like he believes that the U.S., as a powerful nation, has a responsibility to govern and civilize less developed nations.\n\nD. Racial superiority confers responsibility to the United States and Europe over the affairs of developing nations.\n\nWhile there might be undertones of racial superiority in the way he refers to \"enlightened, self-governing people\" and \"savages,\" the speech doesn't explicitly state that racial superiority is the basis for this responsibility. It seems more focused on the idea of moral duty and civilization rather than race.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C seems to be the most accurate reflection of Beveridge's argument in this excerpt. He is emphasizing the moral duty of powerful nations to govern less developed ones, suggesting that it's part of the U.S.'s mission and destiny to do so.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
