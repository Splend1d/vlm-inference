                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem about fluid flow in pipes. So, there's an ideal fluid flowing through a pipe with radius Q and flow speed V. Then, the pipe splits into three separate paths, each with radius Q/2. I need to find the flow speed through each of these paths. The options are 1/3 V, 2/3 V, 4/3 V, and 4V.\n\nOkay, first things first, I remember that for ideal fluids, the flow is steady and incompressible. That means the mass flow rate should be the same everywhere in the pipe. So, the volume flow rate should be conserved as well.\n\nThe volume flow rate (Q) is given by the formula:\n\nQ = A * v\n\nwhere A is the cross-sectional area of the pipe, and v is the flow velocity.\n\nSo, before the split, the flow rate is:\n\nQ1 = \u03c0 * Q^2 * V\n\nAfter the split, the pipe divides into three paths, each with radius Q/2. So, each of these smaller paths has an area:\n\nA2 = \u03c0 * (Q/2)^2 = \u03c0 * (Q^2)/4\n\nNow, since the flow rate should be conserved, the total flow rate after the split should be equal to the flow rate before the split.\n\nSo, Q1 = Q2_total\n\nBut after the split, the flow divides into three separate paths. Assuming the flow splits equally among the three paths, each path would have the same flow rate.\n\nSo, Q2_total = 3 * Q2\n\nTherefore:\n\nQ1 = 3 * Q2\n\nPlugging in the expressions:\n\n\u03c0 * Q^2 * V = 3 * (\u03c0 * (Q^2)/4 * v2)\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\n\u03c0 * Q^2 * V = 3 * (\u03c0 * Q^2 / 4 * v2)\n\nI can cancel out \u03c0 and Q^2 from both sides:\n\nV = 3 * (1/4) * v2\n\nV = 3/4 * v2\n\nSo, v2 = V / (3/4) = (4/3) V\n\nWait, that would be v2 = 4/3 V, which is option C.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused here. Is the flow splitting equally among the three paths? In reality, would that be the case? Maybe not necessarily, but perhaps for ideal fluids, we can assume that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think about the pressures or something else, but the problem seems to suggest that the flow splits into three paths, each with radius Q/2.\n\nWait, but the areas are different. The original pipe has area \u03c0 Q^2, and each of the smaller pipes has area \u03c0 (Q/2)^2 = \u03c0 Q^2 / 4.\n\nSo, the total area after the split is 3 * \u03c0 Q^2 / 4 = 3\u03c0 Q^2 / 4.\n\nSo, the flow rate before the split is Q1 = \u03c0 Q^2 * V.\n\nAfter the split, the flow rate should be the same, so Q1 = Q2_total.\n\nBut Q2_total = 3 * \u03c0 Q^2 / 4 * v2.\n\nSo, \u03c0 Q^2 * V = 3 * \u03c0 Q^2 / 4 * v2\n\nAgain, simplifying:\n\nV = 3/4 * v2\n\nThus, v2 = (4/3) V\n\nSo, the flow speed through each of the paths is 4/3 times the original speed V.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive. If the pipe splits into three smaller pipes, each with a smaller radius, the speed should increase, right? Because the same amount of fluid is being forced through a smaller area.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be C. 4/3 V.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the equation of continuity for each path.\n\nThe equation of continuity is Q = A * v, and since Q is constant, A1 * v1 = A2 * v2.\n\nBefore the split: A1 = \u03c0 Q^2, v1 = V\n\nAfter the split, for each of the three paths: A2 = \u03c0 (Q/2)^2 = \u03c0 Q^2 / 4\n\nSo, for each path:\n\n\u03c0 Q^2 * V = \u03c0 Q^2 / 4 * v2\n\nAgain, canceling \u03c0 Q^2:\n\nV = (1/4) * v2\n\nSo, v2 = 4 V\n\nWait, that would be option D. 4V.\n\nBut that contradicts what I got earlier. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nOh, I see. In the first approach, I considered the total flow rate after the split as 3 * A2 * v2, which is correct.\n\nBut in the second approach, I equated A1 * v1 = A2 * v2, but that's for a single pipe. Maybe I need to adjust that.\n\nWait, no. Since the flow splits into three paths, each with its own A2 and v2, and the total flow rate is conserved, I need to sum the flow rates of the three paths.\n\nSo, A1 * v1 = A2 * v2 * number of paths.\n\nSo, \u03c0 Q^2 * V = 3 * \u03c0 (Q/2)^2 * v2\n\nSimplify:\n\n\u03c0 Q^2 * V = 3 * \u03c0 Q^2 / 4 * v2\n\nCancel \u03c0 Q^2:\n\nV = 3/4 * v2\n\nThus, v2 = 4/3 V\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 4/3 V.\n\nI must have made a mistake in the second approach by incorrectly equating A1 * v1 to A2 * v2 without considering the number of paths.\n\nTherefore, the flow speed through each of the paths is 4/3 times V.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{3}V} \\]"
