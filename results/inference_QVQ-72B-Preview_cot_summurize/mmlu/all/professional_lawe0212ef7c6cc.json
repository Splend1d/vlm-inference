                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here involving a pharmacist who leased a store in a shopping center four years ago. The lease was for 10 years and included a covenant that the owner wouldn't lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. Now, the owner has bought a piece of land next to the shopping center that has a building with a food supermarket and a discount drugstore. The pharmacist found out that the discount drugstore's lease is about to end and the owner plans to renew it. The pharmacist is upset because this seems to violate the covenant in their lease, so they're suing to stop the new lease.\n\nThe question is, if the court rules in favor of the owner, what's the likely reason? There are four options:\n\nA. The covenant in the pharmacist's lease can be fairly construed as to apply only to the original shopping center premises.\n\nB. A covenant cannot restrict the use of land not owned by the covenantor when the covenant was created.\n\nC. A covenant that attempts to restrict competition is invalid as against public policy even if it runs with the land.\n\nD. The drugstore use on the adjacent parcel was in existence when the owner and the pharmacist first entered into the lease.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the pharmacist has a lease with a covenant that the owner won't lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. So, the covenant is specifically about the shopping center premises that were originally leased.\n\nNow, the owner bought an adjacent parcel with a building that already had a discount drugstore in it. This drugstore was already operating when the owner bought the parcel, and the pharmacist's lease was already in place at that time.\n\nThe owner is planning to renew the lease with the discount drugstore, and the pharmacist is protesting this, saying it violates the covenant in their lease.\n\nThe court is finding in favor of the owner, meaning the covenant isn't being enforced to prevent the new lease to the discount drugstore.\n\nSo, why would that be?\n\nOption A says the covenant can be construed to apply only to the original shopping center premises. That makes sense because the covenant specifically mentions the shopping center, which was defined by metes and bounds in the lease. The adjacent parcel is separate from the original shopping center, so the covenant might not apply to it.\n\nOption B says a covenant cannot restrict the use of land not owned by the covenantor when the covenant was created. Hmm, at the time the covenant was created, the owner only owned the original shopping center, not the adjacent parcel. So, the covenant was made without including that adjacent land. Maybe that means the covenant doesn't apply to the adjacent parcel.\n\nOption C says a covenant that restricts competition is invalid against public policy even if it runs with the land. Well, the covenant is restricting competition by preventing another drugstore in the shopping center, which could be seen as anticompetitive. But not all covenants restricting competition are invalid; it depends on the specifics and whether they're reasonable.\n\nOption D says the drugstore use on the adjacent parcel was in existence when the owner and the pharmacist first entered into the lease. Actually, the pharmacist's lease was four years ago, and the owner bought the adjacent parcel last year. So, the pharmacist's lease was in place before the owner bought the adjacent parcel, but the drugstore on the adjacent parcel was already operating for ten years before the owner bought it.\n\nWait, the pharmacist's lease was four years ago, and the owner bought the adjacent parcel last year. So, the pharmacist's lease was already in place when the owner bought the adjacent parcel.\n\nNow, the pharmacist is protesting the renewal of the discount drugstore's lease on the adjacent parcel, claiming it violates the covenant in their lease.\n\nBut the covenant is about the shopping center, which was originally defined in the lease. The adjacent parcel is separate from the original shopping center.\n\nSo, perhaps the covenant only applies to the original shopping center premises and not to the adjacent parcel.\n\nThat would align with option A.\n\nAlternatively, since the covenant was made when the owner only owned the original shopping center, it might not apply to the adjacent parcel acquired later, which supports option B.\n\nOption C about restricting competition might not be the primary reason here, as the covenant was agreed upon in the lease, and courts often enforce such covenants if they're reasonable.\n\nOption D mentions that the drugstore use was in existence when the owner and pharmacist first entered into the lease. But actually, the pharmacist's lease was four years ago, and the owner bought the adjacent parcel last year. So, the drugstore on the adjacent parcel was already operating for ten years before the owner bought it, which was last year.\n\nBut the pharmacist's lease was four years ago, before the owner bought the adjacent parcel. So, the covenant was in place before the owner acquired the adjacent parcel with the drugstore.\n\nSo, perhaps when the owner bought the adjacent parcel with the drugstore, they were aware of the covenant in the pharmacist's lease, but since the drugstore was already there, they might have considered it grandfathered in.\n\nBut now, the lease of the discount drugstore is about to expire, and the owner wants to renew it. The pharmacist is objecting to this renewal, saying it violates the covenant.\n\nBut the covenant applies to the shopping center, and the adjacent parcel is separate from the shopping center. So, maybe the covenant doesn't apply to the adjacent parcel.\n\nAlternatively, since the drugstore was already there when the owner bought the adjacent parcel, perhaps the covenant doesn't apply retroactively to pre-existing uses.\n\nBut the question says that if the court finds for the owner, what's the likely reason?\n\nOption A suggests that the covenant applies only to the original shopping center premises. That seems plausible because the covenant specifically mentions the shopping center, which was defined in the lease.\n\nOption B says a covenant cannot restrict the use of land not owned by the covenantor when the covenant was created. That also makes sense because when the covenant was created, the owner only owned the original shopping center, not the adjacent parcel.\n\nOption C is about public policy against restricting competition, but that might not be the primary reason here.\n\nOption D refers to the drugstore use being in existence when the owner and pharmacist first entered into the lease, but as we saw, the pharmacist's lease was four years ago, and the owner bought the adjacent parcel last year. So, the drugstore was already there for ten years before the owner bought it.\n\nSo, perhaps the court would rule that the covenant doesn't apply to the adjacent parcel because it was not part of the original shopping center, and the covenant was created before the owner acquired the adjacent parcel.\n\nSo, between options A and B, option A seems more directly applicable because it refers to the original shopping center premises, which the covenant specifically mentions.\n\nOption B is more general, saying that a covenant cannot restrict land not owned by the covenantor when the covenant was created. While that might be true in general, in this case, the covenant specifically refers to the shopping center, which was defined in the lease.\n\nSo, perhaps the court would interpret the covenant to apply only to the original shopping center premises, not to any later acquisitions by the owner.\n\nTherefore, the likely reason for the court finding in favor of the owner is option A: the covenant in the pharmacist's lease can be fairly construed as to apply only to the original shopping center premises.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
