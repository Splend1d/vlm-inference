Let's see, federalism is a concept in political science, right? It's about how power is divided in a government structure. So, let's look at each option carefully.\n\nOption A says, \"A government in which the political leader is also the religious leader.\" Hmm, that sounds more like a theocracy or maybe an absolute monarchy, but not specifically federalism. In federalism, it's more about how power is split between different levels of government, not about who holds the power personally.\n\nOption B mentions, \"The concentration of government power in the hands of a small group of people.\" That seems like oligarchy or authoritarianism, where a few individuals hold all the power. Again, not directly related to federalism, which is about dividing power, not concentrating it.\n\nOption C states, \"The division of national power into different branches of government.\" This is interesting. It sounds like the system of checks and balances, where power is divided into legislative, executive, and judicial branches, for example. While this is an important aspect of governance, it's more about separating powers horizontally within the national government. Federalism is more about vertical division of power between the national government and subnational entities like states or provinces.\n\nOption D reads, \"The division of a country's power into national and subnational units.\" This seems the closest to my understanding of federalism. It's about sharing power between the central government and regional governments, allowing for both unity and local autonomy.\n\nLet me double-check. Federalism is a form of government where sovereignty is divided between a central authority and various regional entities. Each level has its own spheres of authority and can make decisions independently in their designated areas. So, this matches with option D pretty well.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other options could also be considered part of federalism. For instance, option C talks about dividing power into different branches, which is important in a democratic system, but it's not the defining characteristic of federalism. Federalism is primarily about the relationship between the central government and the regional governments.\n\nOption A, having the political leader also be the religious leader, isn't a defining feature of federalism. Some federal systems might have a state religion or not, but that's separate from the structure of federalism itself.\n\nOption B, concentrating power in a small group, is the opposite of federalism, which aims to distribute power more widely and prevent any single entity from becoming too powerful.\n\nTherefore, the best definition of federalism among the given options is option D: \"The division of a country's power into national and subnational units.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
