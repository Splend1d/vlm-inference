                    "text": "So I have this problem here about a significance test for a proportion. The null hypothesis is that the proportion p is equal to 0.3, and the alternative hypothesis is that p is greater than 0.3. I have a sample size of 95, and the sample proportion is 0.35. I need to find the p-value for this test.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what a p-value is. The p-value is the probability of observing a sample proportion as extreme or more extreme than the one I have, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. So, if H0 says p = 0.3, I need to find the probability of getting a sample proportion of 0.35 or higher, just by chance, if the true proportion is really 0.3.\n\nSince the sample size is large (n = 95), I can use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. That means I can treat the sampling distribution of the sample proportion as normal, with mean equal to the hypothesized proportion (p0 = 0.3) and standard deviation given by sqrt(p0(1 - p0)/n).\n\nLet me calculate the standard deviation first:\n\nStandard deviation (SE) = sqrt(p0 * (1 - p0) / n) = sqrt(0.3 * 0.7 / 95).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, 0.3 * 0.7 = 0.21\n\nThen, 0.21 / 95 = 0.002210526316 (approximately)\n\nNow, sqrt(0.002210526316) is about 0.047015625.\n\nSo, SE \u2248 0.047.\n\nNow, I need to find how many standard deviations away from the mean my sample proportion is. That is, I need to calculate the z-score:\n\nz = (sample proportion - hypothesized proportion) / SE = (0.35 - 0.3) / 0.047 \u2248 0.05 / 0.047 \u2248 1.0638.\n\nSo, z \u2248 1.06.\n\nNow, since this is a one-tailed test (alternative hypothesis is p > 0.3), I need to find the area to the right of z = 1.06 in the standard normal distribution.\n\nI can look this up in a standard normal table, or use a calculator to find the cumulative probability.\n\nLooking up z = 1.06 in the z-table, I find that the cumulative probability up to z = 1.06 is approximately 0.8554. That means P(Z < 1.06) \u2248 0.8554.\n\nBut since I need the area to the right of z = 1.06, I need to subtract this value from 1:\n\nP(Z > 1.06) = 1 - P(Z < 1.06) \u2248 1 - 0.8554 = 0.1446.\n\nSo, the p-value is approximately 0.1446.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1.06\n\nB. 0.1446\n\nC. 0.2275\n\nD. 0.8554\n\nIt seems that option B is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the standard error calculation:\n\nSE = sqrt(0.3 * 0.7 / 95) = sqrt(0.21 / 95) = sqrt(0.002210526316) \u2248 0.047015625.\n\nThat seems right.\n\nThen, z = (0.35 - 0.3) / 0.047 \u2248 0.05 / 0.047 \u2248 1.0638, which rounds to 1.06.\n\nLooking up z = 1.06 in the table, P(Z < 1.06) \u2248 0.8554, so P(Z > 1.06) \u2248 1 - 0.8554 = 0.1446.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might get confused about whether to use a one-tailed or two-tailed test, but in this case, the alternative hypothesis is directional (p > 0.3), so it's a one-tailed test to the right.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether to apply a continuity correction, but since the sample size is relatively large, and the normal approximation should be adequate without the correction.\n\nSo, I think the p-value is indeed approximately 0.1446, which corresponds to option B.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider what the other options might represent:\n\nOption A is 1.06, which seems too high for a p-value, as p-values range from 0 to 1, but typically they are less than 1 in hypothesis testing.\n\nOption C is 0.2275, which might be a mistake or perhaps a misinterpretation of the z-table.\n\nOption D is 0.8554, which is the cumulative probability up to z = 1.06, but that's P(Z < 1.06), not P(Z > 1.06).\n\nTherefore, the correct p-value is 0.1446, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
