First, I should probably understand what a supply shock is and how it affects the economy.\n\nA supply shock is an unexpected change in the price of inputs that affects production costs. A negative or contractionary supply shock means that production costs increase unexpectedly, leading to a decrease in aggregate supply. This could be due to things like a sudden increase in oil prices, natural disasters that disrupt production, or new government regulations that make production more expensive.\n\nNow, the Phillips curve is a relationship between inflation and unemployment. The original Phillips curve suggested that there is a trade-off between inflation and unemployment: as inflation increases, unemployment decreases, and vice versa. However, in the 1970s, economists observed that both inflation and unemployment could rise at the same time, which was called stagflation. This led to the concept of the expectations-augmented Phillips curve, where inflation expectations play a role in determining the inflation-unemployment trade-off.\n\nA negative supply shock would typically lead to higher inflation and higher unemployment. That is, it would cause stagflation. So, in the context of the Phillips curve, which normally shows a trade-off between inflation and unemployment, a negative supply shock would shift the Phillips curve upwards and to the right, meaning higher inflation for any given level of unemployment.\n\nWait, actually, if the Phillips curve is typically drawn with inflation on the vertical axis and unemployment on the horizontal axis, a shift to the right would imply higher unemployment at each level of inflation, which aligns with the effects of a negative supply shock.\n\nLet me double-check this. If there's a negative supply shock, aggregate supply decreases, which means that at any given price level, less is supplied. This can lead to higher prices (inflation) and lower output, which in turn can lead to higher unemployment.\n\nIn the Phillips curve framework, this would shift the short-run Phillips curve to the right, meaning that for any given rate of unemployment, the inflation rate would be higher than before the shock.\n\nSo, option D seems correct: shift the Phillips curve to the right.\n\nBut let's consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: shift the Phillips curve to the left. This would suggest that for any given unemployment rate, inflation is lower. That doesn't align with the effects of a negative supply shock, which typically causes inflation to increase.\n\nOption B: shift the investment demand curve to the right. A negative supply shock increases production costs, which might make investment less profitable, leading to a decrease in investment demand, not an increase. So, this doesn't seem correct.\n\nOption C: shift the money demand curve to the right. Money demand is primarily a function of income and interest rates. If a negative supply shock leads to lower output and higher prices, money demand might decrease, not increase. So, this also doesn't seem right.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is D: shift the Phillips curve to the right.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll think about the graphical representation. Suppose the original Phillips curve shows inflation increasing as unemployment decreases. A negative supply shock would cause inflation to be higher at every level of unemployment, which indeed shifts the curve to the right.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
