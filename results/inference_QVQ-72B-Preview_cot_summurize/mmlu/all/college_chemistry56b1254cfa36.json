                    "text": "So I have this question here about proteins and their absorption of electromagnetic radiation. It says that all proteins absorb radiation of wavelength around 190 nanometers, and this corresponds to a \u03c0 to \u03c0* excitation in the protein molecule. And I need to figure out in which region of the spectrum this wavelength is found. The options are X-ray, ultraviolet, visible, or infrared.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the general ranges of these different regions in the electromagnetic spectrum. Starting from the shortest wavelengths:\n\n- X-rays are typically from about 0.01 to 10 nanometers.\n\n- Ultraviolet (UV) light ranges from about 10 to 400 nanometers.\n\n- Visible light is from about 400 to 700 nanometers.\n\n- Infrared (IR) radiation starts from about 700 nanometers up to 1 millimeter.\n\nSo, given that the wavelength in question is around 190 nanometers, let's see where that fits.\n\nLooking at the UV range, it's from 10 to 400 nanometers. So, 190 nanometers falls well within that range. But just to be sure, maybe I should check if there are any subcategories within UV that might exclude 190 nanometers.\n\nI remember that UV light is sometimes divided into UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C. UV-C is the shortest UV wavelength, from about 10 to 280 nanometers; UV-B is from 280 to 315 nanometers; and UV-A is from 315 to 400 nanometers. So, 190 nanometers would be in the UV-C region.\n\nBut the question is asking for the general region, not the subregion. So, it's still considered part of the ultraviolet spectrum.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nX-ray is below about 10 nanometers, which is shorter than 190 nm, so that's not it.\n\nVisible light starts around 400 nm, which is longer than 190 nm, so that's not it.\n\nInfrared starts after visible light, so also longer than 190 nm.\n\nTherefore, the only region that fits 190 nm is the ultraviolet region.\n\nWait a minute, sometimes people might refer to shorter wavelengths as X-ray or extreme UV, but in standard terminology, UV ranges up to 400 nm, so 190 nm is definitely within UV.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the energy corresponding to this wavelength. The energy of a photon is given by E = h*c/\u03bb, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and \u03bb is the wavelength.\n\nFor \u03bb = 190 nm, that's 190 x 10^-9 meters.\n\nPlugging into the formula, E = (6.626 x 10^-34 J*s) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (190 x 10^-9 m)\n\nCalculating that, E \u2248 10.2 eV (electron volts), since 1 eV is about 1.602 x 10^-19 J.\n\nNow, I know that UV light typically has energies ranging from about 3.1 to 12.4 eV, with UV-C being the highest energy UV, up to about 10 eV.\n\nSo, 10.2 eV aligns perfectly with the upper end of the UV-C spectrum.\n\nTherefore, it's clearly in the ultraviolet region.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the options again:\n\nA. X-ray: X-rays have much higher energies, typically above 100 eV, so not matching 190 nm.\n\nB. Ultraviolet: As established, 190 nm is within the UV range.\n\nC. Visible: Starts around 400 nm, so 190 nm is shorter than that.\n\nD. Infrared: Starts after visible light, so also longer than 400 nm.\n\nHence, the correct answer is B. Ultraviolet.\n\nI think that's solid reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
