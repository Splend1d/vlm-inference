                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a new federal statute aimed at stabilizing rents across the United States. It's supposed to apply to all leasehold contracts entered into after a certain date between landlords and tenants for both residential and commercial properties. The goal is to protect tenants from high rent increases and landlords profiting unfairly without causing a shortage of rental units or violating landlords' constitutional rights.\n\nThe question is asking in which scenario this new federal statute would be most clearly constitutional as applied. There are four options:\n\nA. The rental of a state-owned office building by a state to a privately owned business.\n\nB. The rental of residential property located in the District of Columbia by an individual landlord to a family of six.\n\nC. The rental of an apartment located by a real estate company to an individual tenant.\n\nD. The rental of an office building to a city by an individual landlord.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the constitutional basis for this federal statute. The U.S. Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. Rent control or stabilization measures typically fall under state and local governments' police powers to regulate for the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens. However, if Congress can establish a connection to interstate commerce, it might be able to enact such a statute.\n\nBut there's also the Tenth Amendment, which reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people. So, there might be limits to how far Congress can go in regulating local rent control issues.\n\nAdditionally, there are constitutional protections for property rights and contractual rights, such as the Contract Clause and the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause, which could be relevant here.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Rental of a state-owned office building by a state to a privately owned business.\n\nHere, the property is owned by the state and rented to a private business. If the federal government is trying to regulate rents on state-owned properties, that might raise issues of federalism and the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity. Generally, the federal government cannot regulate the states in ways that interfere with their sovereign functions. So, this might not be constitutional.\n\nOption B: Rental of residential property located in the District of Columbia by an individual landlord to a family of six.\n\nThe District of Columbia is unique because it's not a state; it's under the direct jurisdiction of the federal government. Congress has broad powers to legislate for the District of Columbia under the District of Columbia Clause in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. So, if the statute is applied in D.C., it might be on firmer constitutional ground because of Congress's explicit authority over D.C.\n\nOption C: Rental of an apartment located by a real estate company to an individual tenant.\n\nThis seems like a typical landlord-tenant relationship involving private parties. The real estate company is probably acting as an agent for the landlord. The question is whether the federal government can regulate such private contracts under the Commerce Clause.\n\nOption D: Rental of an office building to a city by an individual landlord.\n\nHere, the tenant is a city, which is a local government entity. Similar to option A, there might be issues with the federal government regulating rents between a private landlord and a local government tenant. There could be implications for the local government's operations and possibly issues of intergovernmental immunity.\n\nConsidering all this, option B seems the most straightforward in terms of constitutional application. Since the District of Columbia is under the direct jurisdiction of Congress, Congress has broader powers to regulate activities there compared to state jurisdictions. Therefore, applying a federal rent stabilization statute in D.C. would likely be more clearly constitutional than in other scenarios.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether there are any specific constitutional issues even in D.C. For instance, if the statute unduly infringes on property rights or contractual rights, there could still be challenges under the Fifth Amendment. But compared to the other options, where there are clearer issues of federalism and intergovernmental relations, option B appears to be the least problematic.\n\nSo, my answer would be B. The rental of residential property located in the District of Columbia by an individual landlord to a family of six.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
