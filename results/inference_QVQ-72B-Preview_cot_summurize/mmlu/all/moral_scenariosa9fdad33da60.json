                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario separately and apply the moral standards from 2020 in the US to them. I should also consider what \"clearly morally wrong\" means\u2014probably something that's widely agreed upon as unethical or against societal norms at that time and place.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"The skate park was closed for the day, so I left and did not enter.\"\n\nSo, the skate park is closed, and the person decides not to enter. What could be the moral implications here? Well, if the skate park is closed, there might be reasons for that, like it's after hours, maybe for safety reasons, or perhaps there's maintenance work going on. Entering when it's closed could be seen as trespassing or ignoring rules put in place for everyone's safety.\n\nBut in this scenario, the person chooses not to enter, which seems like the responsible thing to do. They're following the rules and prioritizing safety by not entering a closed facility. So, from that perspective, it doesn't seem morally wrong; in fact, it seems morally right.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe the person wanted to skate but respected the closure, which could be seen as showing consideration for others and adhering to rules. But the question is about whether this action is morally wrong, and in this case, it appears not.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I wrote a love letter to my married coworker.\"\n\nThis one seems more complex. The person wrote a love letter to a coworker who is married. Now, in 2020 in the US, marriage is generally considered a commitment between two people, and engaging in relationships outside of that commitment is typically viewed as adultery or cheating.\n\nWriting a love letter to a married person could be seen as expressing romantic interest or love, which, depending on the context, could be inappropriate or unethical, especially if it's a coworker, which adds another layer of complexity due to workplace dynamics.\n\nIn many workplaces, there are policies against fraternization or relationships between coworkers to avoid conflicts of interest or harassment claims. So, even aside from the marital status, writing a love letter to a coworker might be considered unprofessional or against company policy.\n\nBut here, the coworker is also married. So, not only is it a coworker, but they're also in a committed relationship. Expressing romantic interest in someone who is married is generally considered disrespectful to their partner and their marriage. It could also put the married coworker in an awkward position, as they might feel pressured or uncomfortable at work.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, many people in the US would consider this action wrong because it disregards the boundaries of the married person's relationship and could potentially cause harm to all parties involved.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not entering the closed skate park \u2013 This seems like a morally acceptable decision, as it respects rules and safety.\n\n- Scenario 2: Writing a love letter to a married coworker \u2013 This is likely considered morally wrong, given the respect for marriage and professional boundaries.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about any possible nuances.\n\nIn Scenario 1, is there any way that not entering the closed skate park could be considered morally wrong? Maybe if the person was planning to vandalize or cause trouble, but the way it's phrased, it seems like they just left without entering, which is a responsible action.\n\nIn Scenario 2, perhaps the married coworker and their partner have an open relationship or something, but generally, assuming someone is married implies monogamy unless stated otherwise. So, writing a love letter without that knowledge could still be seen as crossing a line.\n\nAlso, considering the power dynamics in the workplace, writing a love letter could be seen as inappropriate behavior, potentially bordering on harassment, especially if the recipient doesn't feel the same way.\n\nSo, all things considered, it reinforces the idea that Scenario 2 is morally wrong, while Scenario 1 is not.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
