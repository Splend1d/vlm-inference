                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about an ideal gas undergoing an isothermal expansion. So, it's at a constant temperature, right? And it's an ideal gas, which means we can probably use some thermodynamic relations here.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what happens to an ideal gas when it expands isothermally. Since it's isothermal, the temperature remains constant. For an ideal gas, the internal energy (\u0394E) depends only on temperature. So, if temperature doesn't change, \u0394E should be zero. That makes sense.\n\nSo, option C says \u0394E = 0. That seems correct.\n\nBut let's think about the first law of thermodynamics, which is \u0394E = q + w. If \u0394E is zero, then q + w = 0, which means q = -w. So, option D also seems correct.\n\nOption A says q = 0. But in an isothermal expansion, the gas is exchanging heat with the surroundings to keep the temperature constant. So, q shouldn't be zero. In fact, the gas must absorb or release heat to maintain a constant temperature while expanding or compressing.\n\nOption B says w = 0. But in an expansion, the gas is doing work against the external pressure, so w shouldn't be zero either.\n\nWait, but in an isothermal process, both q and w are non-zero, but their sum is zero because \u0394E is zero.\n\nSo, between options C and D, both seem correct, but maybe I need to choose the one that directly follows from the given conditions.\n\nLet me consider the mathematical expressions for an isothermal process. For an ideal gas, PV = nRT. Since T is constant, PV = constant.\n\nIn an isothermal expansion, P decreases as V increases, but their product remains constant.\n\nNow, work done during an isothermal expansion is given by w = -nRT ln(Vf/Vi), where Vf is the final volume and Vi is the initial volume.\n\nSince the temperature is constant, the internal energy \u0394E is zero, which confirms option C.\n\nThen, from the first law, q = -w. So, q = nRT ln(Vf/Vi).\n\nTherefore, q and w are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, which is option D.\n\nSo, both C and D seem correct.\n\nBut maybe I need to think about which one is more fundamentally true or directly applicable here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the options in terms of the thermodynamic variables.\n\nOption A, q = 0, is not correct because in an isothermal process, heat is exchanged.\n\nOption B, w = 0, is also not correct because work is being done during the expansion.\n\nOption C, \u0394E = 0, is correct because internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on temperature, and temperature is constant.\n\nOption D, q = -w, is also correct because of the first law when \u0394E = 0.\n\nBut the question asks to choose one, and both C and D seem correct.\n\nMaybe I need to see which one is more directly applicable or if one of them has any exceptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to look at it.\n\nLet me consider the options again.\n\nOption A: q = 0. This is not true for an isothermal process unless it's a special case like a free expansion, which is adiabatic, but that's not the case here.\n\nOption B: w = 0. No, the gas does work against the external pressure during expansion.\n\nOption C: \u0394E = 0. Yes, because internal energy is a function of temperature only for an ideal gas.\n\nOption D: q = -w. Yes, from the first law since \u0394E = 0.\n\nSo, both C and D are correct statements.\n\nBut perhaps the question wants to test understanding of the relationships between q, w, and \u0394E.\n\nMaybe I need to choose the option that is always true regardless of the path.\n\nOption C, \u0394E = 0, is always true for an ideal gas in an isothermal process.\n\nOption D, q = -w, is also always true for an isothermal process where \u0394E = 0.\n\nBut perhaps the question expects only one answer, so maybe I need to pick the one that is most directly related to the process.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding.\n\nLet me check standard textbooks or resources to confirm.\n\nIn an isothermal process for an ideal gas:\n\n- \u0394E = 0 (since E depends only on T)\n\n- q = -w (from the first law)\n\n- w = -nRT ln(V2/V1)\n\n- q = nRT ln(V2/V1)\n\nSo, both C and D are correct.\n\nBut perhaps the question expects only one answer, so maybe there's a mistake in the options or the question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that in some contexts, one of these options is more significant.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is trying to test the understanding that in an isothermal process, \u0394E = 0, which is a fundamental property of ideal gases, whereas q = -w is a consequence of that.\n\nSo, perhaps option C is more fundamental, and option D is a consequence.\n\nBut both are true statements for an isothermal process.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question has a typo, and one of the options should be different.\n\nGiven the options provided, and based on my understanding, both C and D are true for an isothermal expansion of an ideal gas.\n\nHowever, since the question likely expects a single answer, and both C and D seem correct, perhaps I need to prioritize the direct relationship.\n\nOption C states \u0394E = 0, which is a direct property of ideal gases in isothermal processes.\n\nOption D states q = -w, which follows from the first law when \u0394E = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps option C is more fundamental, and that's the answer to pick.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to say that q = -w, which is also true, but perhaps the intended answer is C.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with option C as the most directly correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
