                    "text": "Alright, let's tackle this question about the global aging population. There are four statements here, and I need to identify which one is correct. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: \"It is predicted that by 2040 over 25% of the world's population will be 65 years or older.\" Hmm, I know that the population is aging, but is it really going to be a quarter of the entire population by 2040? That seems pretty high. Let me think about the current figures. I think right now, around 8.5% of the world's population is aged 65 or older. So, if it's projected to more than triple in the next couple of decades, that seems steep. Maybe I should look up some demographic projections to verify this.\n\nMoving on to option B: \"The rate of increase in the median age of populations is greater in developing countries than wealthy countries.\" I've heard that developing countries are experiencing rapid aging because of improvements in healthcare and living standards, which lead to longer life expectancies. At the same time, fertility rates are declining. However, I thought that wealthy countries have been aging for longer because they experienced these improvements earlier. So, maybe the rate of increase is faster in developing countries now, but I'm not entirely sure. Perhaps I need to check some data on median age trends in different types of countries.\n\nNext is option C: \"In older age groups, men outnumber women.\" From what I've observed, it seems like women generally live longer than men. So, in older age brackets, like 80 and above, there are usually more women than men. For example, in many places, you'll find more elderly women in nursing homes. So, this statement seems contrary to what I know. Maybe it's different in certain countries, but generally, I think women outlive men.\n\nLastly, option D: \"Men have a lower mortality rate than women over the life course.\" Mortality rate refers to the rate of death in a population, right? I know that, on average, women tend to live longer than men. That means they have lower mortality rates compared to men. So, if men have a lower mortality rate than women, that would mean men live longer, which contradicts what I know. Wait, maybe I have this backwards. No, I think I'm correct. Generally, women have lower mortality rates than men at most ages, which is why they have longer life expectancies.\n\nAlright, let's summarize what I've thought through:\n\n- Option A: Seems too high; current trends don't support such a drastic increase by 2040.\n\n- Option B: Possible, given recent improvements in healthcare in developing countries and declining fertility rates.\n\n- Option C: Contradicts what I know about life expectancy; women generally live longer than men.\n\n- Option D: Also contradicts what I know about life expectancy and mortality rates; women generally have lower mortality rates.\n\nGiven this, I think option B is the correct one. The rate of increase in the median age of populations is greater in developing countries than in wealthy countries. This makes sense because developing countries are seeing rapid declines in fertility and improvements in healthcare, leading to a faster aging of their populations compared to wealthier countries, which have already gone through these transitions over a longer period.\n\nTo make sure, let me do a quick check. I recall that some countries in sub-Saharan Africa are experiencing rapid aging due to decreasing fertility rates and increasing life expectancies. Similarly, in Asia, countries like China and India are seeing their populations age quickly. In contrast, European countries have been aging slowly over the past few decades. So, yes, the rate of increase in median age seems to be faster in developing countries.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option B is the correct statement about the global aging population.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
