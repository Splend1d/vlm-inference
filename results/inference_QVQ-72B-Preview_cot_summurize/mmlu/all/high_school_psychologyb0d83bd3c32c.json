                    "text": "So I have this question about drive-reduction theories, and I need to figure out which option doesn't fit well with these theories. Let me first make sure I understand what drive-reduction theory is. From what I recall, drive-reduction theory suggests that organisms are motivated to reduce internal tensions caused by needs or desires. So, things like hunger, thirst, or even the need for social interaction can create a drive that pushes us to behave in ways that reduce that drive.\n\nAlright, with that in mind, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Jerome is running a five-mile race and grabs water to quench his thirst. This seems straightforward. He's thirsty (a drive), and he's trying to reduce that thirst by drinking water. Drive-reduction theory would explain this pretty well.\n\nB. Ernest eats a few cookies on his way to class because he didn't have time for lunch. So, he's hungry (drive) and eating cookies to reduce his hunger. Again, this fits neatly into drive-reduction theory.\n\nC. Tish decides to skip lunch because she's still full from a big breakfast. Hmm, this is interesting. Here, Tish isn't experiencing hunger (drive) at the moment because she's still full. So, she doesn't feel the need to eat lunch. Drive-reduction theory would say that since there's no drive to reduce, there's no motivation to eat. So, this also seems consistent with the theory.\n\nD. Kezia is very full after dinner but decides to order the strawberry cheesecake anyway. Wait a minute, this seems different. She's already full, meaning her hunger drive should be reduced. So, according to drive-reduction theory, she shouldn't feel motivated to eat more. But she decides to order dessert anyway. This seems to contradict the theory because she's engaging in behavior that doesn't reduce her drive; in fact, it might increase it.\n\nLet me think about this more deeply. Drive-reduction theory focuses on behaviors that reduce internal tensions or needs. In this case, Kezia is already full, so there's no hunger drive to reduce. Yet, she's choosing to eat more. This suggests that there might be other factors at play, such as the appeal of the dessert, social pressures, or perhaps a different type of drive, like the desire for pleasure or variety.\n\nSo, in this context, drive-reduction theory doesn't provide a reasonable explanation for Kezia's behavior because it can't account for why she would eat more when her basic hunger drive is already satisfied.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: Jerome drinking water to quench thirst\u2014clearly drive-reduction.\n\nOption B: Ernest eating cookies because he's hungry\u2014again, drive-reduction.\n\nOption C: Tish skipping lunch because she's full\u2014this is also consistent, as she doesn't have the drive to eat.\n\nOption D: Kezia eating dessert when she's full\u2014this seems to go against drive-reduction theory.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Kezia is very full after eating dinner but decides to order the strawberry cheesecake anyway.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps Kezia has a separate drive for sweets or something, but that seems like a stretch. Drive-reduction theory primarily deals with basic physiological needs, and while some might argue that a sweet tooth is a drive, it's not on the same level as hunger or thirst.\n\nMoreover, in the context of the other options, which all align well with drive-reduction theory, option D stands out as an exception. So, I think it's the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
