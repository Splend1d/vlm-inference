                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about sugar in a soft drink. It says that a 12-ounce soft drink has 41 grams of sugar, and that's 14% of the normal daily allowance for sugar. I need to find out approximately how many grams of sugar are recommended in the normal diet. Okay, so I think this is a percentage problem.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what 14% of the daily allowance is equal to 41 grams. So, if 14% corresponds to 41 grams, I can set up an equation to find 100%, which would be the total daily allowance.\n\nLet me let x be the total daily allowance of sugar in grams. Then, 14% of x is equal to 41 grams. Mathematically, that's 0.14x = 41.\n\nAlright, to solve for x, I need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.14.\n\nSo, x = 41 / 0.14.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n41 divided by 0.14.\n\nFirst, I can multiply both numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate the decimal.\n\nSo, it becomes (41 * 100) / (0.14 * 100) = 4100 / 14.\n\nNow, I need to divide 4100 by 14.\n\nLet me see, 14 times 290 is 4100, because 14 times 300 is 4200, which is 100 more than 4100. So, 14 times 290 is 4060, and then 14 times 292 is 4088, and so on. Wait, maybe it's better to do it step by step.\n\nLet's divide 4100 by 14.\n\nFirst, how many times does 14 go into 41? 14 times 2 is 28, subtracted from 41 gives 13. Bring down a zero to make it 130. 14 times 9 is 126, subtracted from 130 gives 4. Bring down another zero to make it 40. 14 times 2 is 28, subtracted from 40 gives 12. Bring down another zero to make it 120. 14 times 8 is 112, subtracted from 120 gives 8. Bring down another zero to make it 80. 14 times 5 is 70, subtracted from 80 gives 10. Bring down another zero to make it 100. 14 times 7 is 98, subtracted from 100 gives 2. And so on.\n\nSo, the division is 292.857..., which is approximately 292.86 grams.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 5.74\n\nB. 69\n\nC. 293\n\nD. 574\n\nSo, 292.86 is closest to option C. 293.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with 0.14x = 41.\n\nX = 41 / 0.14.\n\nI converted that to 4100 / 14 to avoid decimals.\n\nNow, 14 times 290 is 14 * 290 = 14 * 300 - 14 * 10 = 4200 - 140 = 4060.\n\nSo, 4100 - 4060 = 40.\n\nThen, 14 times 2.857... because 14 * 2.857 \u2248 40.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use a calculator for this, but since I'm explaining, I'll continue manually.\n\nAlternatively, I can simplify 4100 / 14.\n\nLet's see, 14 times 292 is 14 * 200 + 14 * 90 + 14 * 2 = 2800 + 1260 + 28 = 4088.\n\n4100 - 4088 = 12.\n\nSo, 14 times 292 is 4088, leaving a remainder of 12.\n\nThen, 12 / 14 can be written as 6 / 7.\n\nSo, x = 292 + 6/7 \u2248 292.857 grams.\n\nWhich rounds to approximately 293 grams.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 293.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, if 41 grams is 14% of the daily allowance, then the total daily allowance is 100 / 14 times 41.\n\nSo, x = (100 / 14) * 41.\n\nAgain, that's the same as 4100 / 14, which we've already calculated as approximately 292.857 grams.\n\nSo, it confirms that the answer is approximately 293 grams.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. 293.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
