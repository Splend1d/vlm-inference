                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about positioning processes and brand attributes. It asks which of the following are used in the positioning process to illustrate differing attributes of a selection of brands. The options are product features, SIC code, perceptual maps, and organizational characteristics. I need to pick the one that's correctly used for this purpose.\n\nFirst, I should understand what positioning is in marketing. Positioning is about how a product or brand is perceived in the marketplace relative to competing products or brands. It's about creating a distinct image in the minds of consumers based on some differentiation.\n\nNow, the question is asking for a tool or method that helps illustrate differing attributes of brands in the positioning process. So, I need to think about which of these options help us visualize or compare the attributes of different brands.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nA. Product features.\n\nProduct features are specific characteristics or attributes of a product that make it unique or valuable to customers. While product features are important in differentiating brands, they are more of the building blocks of positioning rather than a tool to illustrate differing attributes. Maybe in a feature comparison chart, but that's not exactly a perceptual map.\n\nB. SIC code.\n\nSIC stands for Standard Industrial Classification. It's a system for classifying industries by a four-digit code. This seems more related to industry categorization rather than illustrating brand attributes in a positioning context. Probably not the right answer.\n\nC. Perceptual maps.\n\nPerceptual maps, also known as positioning maps, are graphical representations that plot competing brands based on consumer perceptions of their attributes or benefits. They typically use axes that represent key differentiating factors, such as price versus quality or innovation versus tradition. These maps help visualize how different brands are positioned in the minds of consumers, making it easier to see differences and similarities in their attributes.\n\nD. Organizational characteristics.\n\nOrganizational characteristics refer to the traits or features of a company, such as its size, structure, culture, or management style. While these can influence a brand's positioning, they are more behind-the-scenes factors and not directly a tool for illustrating brand attributes to consumers.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, perceptual maps seem to be the most fitting answer. They are specifically designed to illustrate and compare the perceived attributes of different brands in a visual way, which aligns perfectly with the positioning process.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Is there any chance that another option could also be considered?\n\nLet's see. Product features: yes, they are part of positioning, but they are not a tool for illustrating differing attributes; they are more the content that goes into positioning.\n\nSIC code: this is about industry classification, not about illustrating brand attributes.\n\nOrganizational characteristics: these influence positioning but again, they are not a tool for illustrating brand attributes to consumers or for positioning purposes.\n\nTherefore, perceptual maps are indeed the correct choice here. They are explicitly used to visualize and compare how different brands are perceived based on various attributes.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll think about an example. Suppose there are several brands of smartphones in the market. A perceptual map might plot them based on factors like price and perceived quality. This would show where each brand stands in terms of these attributes and help illustrate differences in their positioning.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, my final answer is C. Perceptual maps.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
