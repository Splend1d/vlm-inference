                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario entails. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I told a lie when questioned under oath.\n\nScenario 2: I knowingly rented out a fantastic apartment building at better than market rates.\n\nOkay, so in Scenario 1, someone is lying under oath. I know that lying under oath is called perjury, and it's against the law. But the question is about moral wrongness, not necessarily legal wrongness. Although, in many cases, what's illegal is also considered morally wrong.\n\nUnder ordinary moral standards in the US, lying in general is considered wrong, especially when you're under oath. Being under oath typically means you're promising to tell the truth, usually in a formal setting like a court proceeding. So, if someone lies in that context, it's both legally and morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: knowingly renting out a fantastic apartment building at better than market rates. Hmm, this seems a bit different. So, someone is renting out a really nice apartment building, and they're charging less than what the market would typically allow for such a property.\n\nAt first glance, charging less than market rate might seem like a generous or kind act, not a morally wrong one. But the phrase \"knowingly\" suggests that the person is aware of the below-market rate and is choosing to do so deliberately.\n\nNow, I need to consider why someone might do this. Maybe they want to help out tenants who can't afford higher rents, or perhaps they have a personal reason for keeping the rents low. Alternatively, maybe there's some other motive involved.\n\nBut the question is to determine whether this action is clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet me think about this. If someone is renting at below-market rates knowingly, and there's nothing illegal or coercive about it, is it wrong?\n\nWell, in general, setting rent prices is usually governed by supply and demand in a free market economy. As long as the landlord isn't engaging in discriminatory practices or breaking any rent control laws, they have the right to set rents as they see fit.\n\nCharging more than the market rate could be seen as taking advantage of tenants, but charging less seems like the opposite. It's providing a benefit to the tenants, which is generally considered a good thing.\n\nWait a minute, but what if the landlord is losing money by renting below market rate, and this could potentially harm the maintenance of the property or lead to financial difficulties? That might have implications for the tenants or other stakeholders.\n\nHowever, assuming that the landlord can afford to rent at below-market rates without causing harm to others, it's hard to see how this action is morally wrong.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether the landlord is being honest about the rent price and not misleading tenants in any way. If the landlord is being transparent and not hiding any additional fees or conditions, then it seems even less likely that this would be considered morally wrong.\n\nPerhaps there's more to this scenario that isn't being disclosed, but based on the information given, renting at better than market rates knowingly doesn't seem to align with being morally wrong.\n\nContrast that with Scenario 1, where lying under oath is clearly established as both legally and morally wrong.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\n- Scenario 1: Lying under oath \u2013 clearly morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Renting at better than market rates knowingly \u2013 not clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait, but the options are labeled as A, B, C, D, with descriptions. Let's check:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nYes, that matches my conclusion.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there's any other perspective that might change this view.\n\nFor example, could renting at below-market rates be considered morally wrong in some circumstances? Maybe if the landlord is doing it to gain favor or as a bribe, but the scenario doesn't specify any such intentions. It simply states that the person is renting out the apartment at better than market rates knowingly.\n\nWithout additional context, it's difficult to see how this action in itself is morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, lying under oath is straightforwardly morally wrong, as it undermines the justice system and the trust placed in individuals to tell the truth in legal proceedings.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
