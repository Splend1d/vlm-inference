                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out whether the trial court will grant the woman's motion to preclude the man's comparative negligence defense. Let me try to understand all the parts involved.\n\nFirst, there's a woman who's an inexperienced bike rider. She couldn't stop at a red light and went into the intersection, fell off her bike, and while trying to get back on, she got run over by a car. The car driver had a green light and was distracted by his cell phone, and he got a careless driving ticket from the police. Now, the woman is suing for damages and claiming that the driver was negligent per se, which means he violated a statute or law that's designed to protect people, and that this negligence per se prevents the driver from asserting comparative negligence under the state's statute.\n\nOkay, so negligence per se is when someone violates a law that's meant to protect against a certain kind of harm, and that violation causes that harm. It's basically saying that by breaking the law, the person is automatically negligent.\n\nNow, comparative negligence is when both sides have some fault in the incident, and the damages are apportioned based on each party's percentage of fault. So, if the woman is also at fault, the driver might try to reduce the amount he has to pay by pointing out her contributions to the accident.\n\nThe woman is arguing that because the driver was negligent per se, he can't use comparative negligence as a defense. She's trying to prevent the driver from saying that she was also negligent and therefore should bear some of the responsibility.\n\nNow, the question is whether the trial court will grant her motion to preclude this defense.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because the driver had the last clear chance to avoid the accident, which abrogates the comparative negligence law.\n\nB. Yes, because negligence per se is a final judgment of total negligence against the driver and it cannot be modified or rebutted.\n\nC. No, because the common law doctrine of negligence per se does not abrogate the defendant's right to apportion fault under the comparative negligence statute.\n\nD. No, because she entered the intersection knowing it was a red light, thereby putting herself voluntarily and knowingly in danger, and she assumed the risk.\n\nAlright, let's analyze these one by one.\n\nOption A mentions the \"last clear chance\" doctrine. I think this doctrine allows a court to shift liability entirely to one party if they had the last opportunity to avoid the accident but failed to do so. In this case, if the driver had the last clear chance to avoid hitting the woman but didn't because he was distracted, maybe the court would hold him fully responsible. But I'm not sure if this abrogates the comparative negligence law. Maybe in some jurisdictions, but not necessarily everywhere.\n\nOption B says that negligence per se is a final judgment of total negligence and cannot be modified or rebutted. Hmm, I thought that negligence per se establishes liability, but it doesn't necessarily prevent the defendant from arguing that the plaintiff also contributed to the harm. So, maybe this is not entirely accurate.\n\nOption C says no, because the common law doctrine of negligence per se doesn't override the defendant's right to apportion fault under the comparative negligence statute. This seems plausible. Even if the driver was negligent per se, the state's comparative negligence law might still allow the driver to argue that the woman was also negligent and should bear some responsibility.\n\nOption D says no, because the woman assumed the risk by entering the intersection knowing it was a red light. Assumption of risk is a defense where the plaintiff knowingly and voluntarily faces a hazard and is therefore not entitled to damages. But in this case, she didn't stop at the red light and fell off her bike, which led to her getting hit. So, maybe she did assume some risk, but is that enough to completely bar her recovery?\n\nI think the key here is understanding how negligence per se interacts with comparative negligence laws.\n\nNegligence per se establishes that the defendant was negligent because they violated a statute intended to protect against the kind of harm that occurred. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that the plaintiff can't also be negligent.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, even if the defendant is negligent per se, the plaintiff's own negligence can be considered under comparative negligence principles to reduce the defendant's liability.\n\nSo, if the woman was also negligent by entering the intersection without stopping, her damages might be reduced by the percentage of her fault.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the driver should be allowed to present a comparative negligence defense, despite the negligence per se finding.\n\nBut let's look back at the options.\n\nOption A suggests that because the driver had the last clear chance, comparative negligence doesn't apply. But this seems confusing because last clear chance is a separate doctrine that might apply in some jurisdictions to shift liability, but it's not universally recognized, and it doesn't necessarily preclude a comparative negligence defense.\n\nOption B claims that negligence per se is a final judgment of total negligence that can't be modified. That seems too absolute. Usually, negligence per se just establishes the defendant's negligence, but doesn't preclude other defenses like comparative negligence.\n\nOption C says no, because the common law doctrine of negligence per se doesn't override the defendant's right to apportion fault under the comparative negligence statute. This makes sense because statutes typically govern over common law in cases of conflict, and if the state has a comparative negligence statute, it should apply.\n\nOption D says no, because the woman assumed the risk by entering the intersection knowing it was a red light. Assumption of risk is a defense that can bar recovery, but in some jurisdictions, it's been replaced or modified by comparative negligence. So, even if she assumed the risk, her damages might just be reduced by her percentage of fault rather than completely barred.\n\nGiven this, option C seems the most straightforward and legally sound. It recognizes that even if the driver was negligent per se, the comparative negligence statute allows for apportionment of fault between both parties.\n\nSo, I think the trial court is unlikely to grant the woman's motion to preclude the comparative negligence defense, because the common law doctrine of negligence per se doesn't override the statutory right to apportion fault under comparative negligence.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. No, because the common law doctrine of negligence per se does not abrogate the defendant's right to apportion fault under the comparative negligence statute.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
