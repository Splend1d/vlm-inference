                    "text": "So I'm reading this passage from Jacob Riis's book \"How the Other Half Lives\" from 1890. It's about a young woman working in the manufacturing department of a Broadway house, and she's only making three dollars a week. She pays $1.50 for her room and can only afford one meal a day because she can't manage breakfast or lunch. The author is highlighting her difficult living conditions and how she's barely surviving on such a low income.\n\nRiis mentions that she's young and pretty and suggests that her situation could lead her to make choices like early marriage, which moralists at the time saw as a cause of distress among the poor. He also shares a quote from a lodger in a girls' home who feels healthier since she started getting three meals a day, implying that many of these young women were not getting enough to eat.\n\nAdditionally, two young sewing-girls are mentioned who are seeking domestic service just to ensure they have enough food, showing that even pride is set aside when faced with the reality of starvation.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of the following options Riis's work as an investigator of the lives of the poor can most directly be associated with:\n\nA. Yellow Journalism\n\nB. Abolitionism\n\nC. The muckrakers\n\nD. Socialism\n\nI need to think about what each of these terms refers to and see which one fits best with Riis's approach and objectives.\n\nStarting with Yellow Journalism: I recall that Yellow Journalism was a type of journalism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that was known for sensationalism, exaggeration, and sometimes fabricated stories to increase newspaper circulation. It often lacked the objectivity and fact-checking that we associate with modern journalism.\n\nAbolitionism was the movement to end slavery, particularly in the United States before the Civil War. It was a significant social and political movement that led to the eventual abolition of slavery.\n\nThe muckrakers were investigative journalists in the early 20th century who focused on exposing corruption, injustice, and social problems. They played a crucial role in the Progressive Era by bringing attention to issues like poverty, child labor, and unsafe working conditions, which led to reforms.\n\nSocialism is an economic and political system where major resources and means of production are owned and controlled by the state, with the aim of distributing wealth more equally among the population.\n\nGiven this background, I need to determine which of these Riis's work is most directly associated with.\n\nFirst, considering Yellow Journalism: while Riis was a journalist, his work was based on thorough investigation and documentation of the lives of the poor, particularly in New York City's slums. He used photography and detailed descriptions to highlight the harsh realities faced by the underprivileged. His approach seems more grounded in facts and less in sensationalism compared to Yellow Journalism. So, maybe this isn't the best fit.\n\nNext, Abolitionism: Riis was active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, after the abolition of slavery in the United States (which happened in 1865 with the 13th Amendment). While issues of inequality and poverty certainly persisted, his work was more focused on the living conditions of the urban poor, including immigrants, rather than specifically on slavery or its remnants. So, this might not be the most direct association.\n\nThen, The muckrakers: This seems promising. The muckrakers were known for their investigative journalism into social issues and corruption, aiming to expose problems and prompt reforms. Riis's work fits well here, as he was documenting and bringing attention to the dire living conditions of the poor, which aligns with the muckrakers' goals. His book \"How the Other Half Lives\" was influential in raising awareness about poverty and led to reforms in housing and working conditions.\n\nFinally, Socialism: While Riis's work did highlight inequalities and the need for social reforms, his approach was more journalistic and focused on documenting reality rather than advocating for a specific economic system. He didn't seem to be promoting state ownership of resources or a socialist ideology in his work. His aim was more to inform and influence public opinion through facts and images rather than to push for a particular political ideology.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the best answer is C. The muckrakers. Riis's investigative work into the lives of the poor directly aligns with the muckrakers' methods and objectives of exposing social injustices and promoting reforms through journalism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
