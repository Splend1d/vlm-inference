Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these terms refers to a forward-thrusting lower face.\n\nFirst, let's break it down. A forward-thrusting lower face sounds like the jaw sticks out compared to the upper part of the face. So, I need to find a term that describes this characteristic.\n\nOption A is \"arboreal.\" I think arboreal refers to something related to trees, like animals that live in trees. But that doesn't seem to directly relate to the shape of the face or jaw. Maybe it's a distractor.\n\nOption B is \"prognathous.\" This sounds familiar. I think it has to do with the jaw protruding. Let me see. Prognathous comes from the Greek words \"pro-\" meaning forward and \"gnathos\" meaning jaw. So, that seems to fit perfectly. It describes a condition where the jaw projects forward.\n\nOption C is \"diastema.\" I recall that diastema refers to a gap or space between teeth, often seen between the front teeth. That's not about the overall shape of the face; it's specifically about spacing between teeth. So, probably not the right answer.\n\nOption D is \"mandible.\" The mandible is the lower jawbone in vertebrates. It's the bone that moves when we open and close our mouths. While it's part of the lower face, just saying \"mandible\" doesn't capture the idea of a forward-thrusting lower face. It's more about the structure itself rather than its projection.\n\nSo, considering all the options, \"prognathous\" seems to be the term that describes a forward-thrusting lower face. It's a descriptive adjective for the protrusion of the jaw, which matches the description given in the question.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. Is there any chance that another option could also fit? Well, \"arboreal\" is about living in trees, which is unrelated. \"Diastema\" is about gaps between teeth, which is different. \"Mandible\" is the lower jaw bone, but not specifically about its projection forwards.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. prognathous.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
