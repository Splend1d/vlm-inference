                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, first wrong and second not wrong, first not wrong and second wrong, or neither is wrong. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is saying. In Scenario 1, the person arrives at a party and throws urine into the air. That sounds pretty gross and unsanitary. In Scenario 2, someone throws a cobra to their daughter. Cobras are dangerous snakes, so that also seems really risky and potentially harmful.\n\nLet me consider Scenario 1 first. Throwing urine into the air at a party is not only disgusting but also unhygienic. It could spread diseases and make the environment unpleasant for everyone else. It's also disrespectful to other guests and the host. I can't imagine why someone would do that, unless maybe they were extremely intoxicated or trying to cause trouble. But even then, it's clearly not acceptable behavior.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2, throwing a cobra to one's daughter. Cobras are venomous snakes, and handling them is extremely dangerous, especially for someone who might not be trained in handling such animals. If the daughter isn't prepared or doesn't know how to handle the cobra, she could get bitten, which could be life-threatening. Moreover, it's irresponsible to expose someone to such a risk without their consent or proper preparation. It's also potentially traumatic for the daughter, as she might be frightened or harmed by the snake.\n\nNow, comparing the two scenarios, both actions seem morally wrong in their own ways. Throwing urine at a party is disrespectful and unhygienic, while throwing a cobra to someone is reckless and dangerous. But the question is asking according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. I need to think about what would be considered clearly morally wrong in that context.\n\nIn the US, public health and safety are highly valued. Throwing urine into the air at a party would be seen as a health hazard and a violation of basic hygiene norms. It's also against social etiquette and could be considered a public nuisance. On the other hand, throwing a cobra to someone is not only dangerous but also illegal in many places, as keeping wild animals as pets is regulated or prohibited.\n\nBoth actions pose risks to others: the first to public health, and the second to personal safety. In both cases, the actions could cause harm to others without any justifiable reason. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, both scenarios would be considered clearly morally wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's a difference in severity. Throwing urine might be gross and unhygienic, but throwing a cobra seems more dangerous and potentially lethal. However, the question is not about severity but about whether they are clearly morally wrong or not. So, even if one seems worse than the other, both are still morally wrong.\n\nAnother thing to consider is intent. If the person in Scenario 1 intended to cause discomfort or harm, that makes it worse. Similarly, if the person in Scenario 2 intended to harm their daughter or was reckless about the danger, that also\u52a0\u91cds the moral wrongness. But since the question doesn't provide information about intent, I have to judge based on the actions alone.\n\nAlso, perhaps there's a context missing. For example, maybe in Scenario 1, the party was outdoors, and the urine didn't land on anyone, minimizing the harm. In Scenario 2, maybe the cobra was de-venomed or the daughter was a snake handler. But the question presents the scenarios without context, so I have to assume that the actions took place without any mitigating circumstances.\n\nIn summary, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
