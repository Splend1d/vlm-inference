                    "text": "Let's see what this question is about. It's about fractional reserve banking. I remember learning about this in economics class. So, fractional reserve banking is a system where banks don't keep all their deposits in cash; instead, they lend out a portion of those deposits while keeping a certain percentage as reserves. This helps create money in the economy because when banks lend money, that money can be spent and lent again, increasing the overall money supply.\n\nNow, the question is asking what having a fractional reserve banking system means. There are four options:\n\nA. No single loan can be larger than 20 percent of the bank\u2019s holdings.\n\nB. The central bank reserves the right to audit any bank at any time.\n\nC. The central bank holds a certain fraction of GDP on reserve at all times.\n\nD. A bank cannot lend out all of its deposits.\n\nI need to figure out which of these statements accurately describes a fractional reserve banking system.\n\nLet's start by eliminating the ones that don't directly relate to the concept.\n\nOption A says that no single loan can be larger than 20 percent of the bank\u2019s holdings. Hmm, in fractional reserve banking, there might be regulations on lending practices, but I don't recall anything specific about the size of a single loan relative to the bank's holdings. This seems more related to risk management or lending limits, not directly to the fractional reserve requirement itself. So, maybe this isn't the core aspect of fractional reserve banking.\n\nOption B says that the central bank reserves the right to audit any bank at any time. While it's true that central banks do regulate and\u76d1\u7763 banks, including auditing them periodically to ensure compliance with regulations, this isn't unique to fractional reserve banking. Even in other banking systems, central banks or regulatory authorities might conduct audits. So, this seems more about general bank regulation rather than the specific feature of fractional reserve banking.\n\nOption C states that the central bank holds a certain fraction of GDP on reserve at all times. This sounds a bit confusing. In fractional reserve banking, banks are required to hold a certain percentage of deposits as reserves, either in vault cash or at the central bank. But it's not that the central bank holds a fraction of GDP on reserve; rather, banks hold reserves, and the central bank sets the reserve requirements. So, this option seems to misrepresent how the system works.\n\nOption D says that a bank cannot lend out all of its deposits. This actually sounds like a key feature of fractional reserve banking. Because banks are required to keep a certain percentage of deposits as reserves, they cannot lend out 100% of their deposits. If they did, they wouldn't have enough funds to cover withdrawals by depositors. So, this seems to align with the concept of fractional reserve banking.\n\nLet me double-check this understanding. Suppose the reserve requirement is 10%. If a bank has $100 in deposits, it must keep $10 as reserves and can lend out $90. That $90 can then be deposited into another bank, which would keep $9 as reserves and lend out $81, and so on. This process allows the banking system to create money, as each loan can be deposited and lent out again, expanding the money supply.\n\nSo, in this context, option D accurately describes a fundamental aspect of fractional reserve banking: banks cannot lend out all of their deposits because they must keep a certain portion as reserves.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any other option that could also be considered correct. For example, perhaps option C could be interpreted differently. If the central bank holds a certain fraction of GDP on reserve, that might imply that it's holding reserves equivalent to a percentage of the economy's total output. But in reality, central banks hold reserves from banks, which are a portion of deposits, not directly a fraction of GDP. So, I think option C is not accurately describing a feature of fractional reserve banking.\n\nSimilarly, option A seems to be more about lending limits per loan rather than the reserve requirements. While there might be regulations on loan sizes, they aren't directly tied to the concept of fractional reserves.\n\nOption B is about auditing rights of the central bank. While auditing is important for ensuring banks comply with regulations, it's not a direct consequence of having a fractional reserve banking system.\n\nTherefore, after considering all the options, I conclude that option D is the correct answer. It accurately captures a core principle of fractional reserve banking: banks cannot lend out all of their deposits because they must maintain a certain reserve level to meet potential deposit withdrawals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
