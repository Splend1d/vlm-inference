                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about eigenvalues and eigenvectors. It says that if \\( v \\) is an eigenvector of an invertible matrix \\( A \\), then which of the following are necessarily true:\n\nI. \\( v \\) is also an eigenvector of \\( 2A \\).\n\nII. \\( v \\) is also an eigenvector of \\( A^2 \\).\n\nIII. \\( v \\) is also an eigenvector of \\( A^{-1} \\).\n\nAnd the options are A. I only, B. II only, C. III only, D. I, II, and III.\n\nAlright, let's start by recalling what an eigenvector is. If \\( A \\) is a matrix and \\( v \\) is a vector, then \\( v \\) is an eigenvector of \\( A \\) if there exists a scalar \\( \\lambda \\) such that \\( Av = \\lambda v \\). This scalar \\( \\lambda \\) is called the eigenvalue.\n\nSo, given that \\( v \\) is an eigenvector of \\( A \\) with eigenvalue \\( \\lambda \\), we have \\( Av = \\lambda v \\).\n\nNow, we need to check for each statement whether \\( v \\) is also an eigenvector of \\( 2A \\), \\( A^2 \\), and \\( A^{-1} \\).\n\nLet's tackle the first one: I. \\( v \\) is also an eigenvector of \\( 2A \\).\n\nWell, let's see. If I compute \\( (2A)v \\), that's just \\( 2(Av) \\), right? Because matrix multiplication is associative.\n\nSo, \\( (2A)v = 2(Av) = 2(\\lambda v) = (2\\lambda)v \\).\n\nSo, \\( (2A)v = (2\\lambda)v \\).\n\nThis looks like \\( v \\) is an eigenvector of \\( 2A \\) with eigenvalue \\( 2\\lambda \\).\n\nWait, but is \\( \\lambda \\) always defined for \\( 2A \\)? Well, since \\( A \\) is invertible, it means \\( \\lambda \\neq 0 \\), because if \\( \\lambda = 0 \\), \\( A \\) wouldn't be invertible. But in this case, \\( 2\\lambda \\) would also be nonzero, so \\( v \\) remains an eigenvector.\n\nSo, statement I seems to be true.\n\nNow, let's look at II. \\( v \\) is also an eigenvector of \\( A^2 \\).\n\nOkay, so we need to compute \\( A^2 v \\).\n\nSince \\( Av = \\lambda v \\), then \\( A^2 v = A(Av) = A(\\lambda v) = \\lambda (Av) = \\lambda (\\lambda v) = \\lambda^2 v \\).\n\nSo, \\( A^2 v = \\lambda^2 v \\).\n\nThis shows that \\( v \\) is an eigenvector of \\( A^2 \\) with eigenvalue \\( \\lambda^2 \\).\n\nAgain, since \\( A \\) is invertible, \\( \\lambda \\neq 0 \\), so \\( \\lambda^2 \\) is also nonzero. Therefore, \\( v \\) remains an eigenvector.\n\nSo, statement II also seems to be true.\n\nLastly, III. \\( v \\) is also an eigenvector of \\( A^{-1} \\).\n\nGiven that \\( A \\) is invertible, \\( A^{-1} \\) exists.\n\nWe need to find if \\( v \\) is an eigenvector of \\( A^{-1} \\).\n\nSo, let's compute \\( A^{-1} v \\).\n\nWait, actually, we know that \\( Av = \\lambda v \\), so multiplying both sides by \\( A^{-1} \\), we get \\( v = A^{-1} (\\lambda v) = \\lambda (A^{-1} v) \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( A^{-1} v = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} v \\).\n\nSo, \\( A^{-1} v = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} v \\), which means \\( v \\) is an eigenvector of \\( A^{-1} \\) with eigenvalue \\( \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\).\n\nAgain, since \\( \\lambda \\neq 0 \\), this is well-defined.\n\nTherefore, statement III is also true.\n\nSo, all three statements I, II, and III are true.\n\nBut wait, the options are A. I only, B. II only, C. III only, D. I, II, and III.\n\nSo, according to my reasoning, D. I, II, and III should be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nFirst, for \\( 2A \\), we have \\( (2A)v = 2\\lambda v \\), which is a scalar multiple, so \\( v \\) is indeed an eigenvector.\n\nSecond, for \\( A^2 \\), \\( A^2 v = \\lambda^2 v \\), again a scalar multiple, so \\( v \\) is an eigenvector.\n\nThird, for \\( A^{-1} \\), \\( A^{-1} v = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} v \\), so again, \\( v \\) is an eigenvector.\n\nMoreover, in each case, the eigenvalue is well-defined because \\( \\lambda \\neq 0 \\), which is guaranteed by the invertibility of \\( A \\).\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D. I, II, and III.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{D}"
