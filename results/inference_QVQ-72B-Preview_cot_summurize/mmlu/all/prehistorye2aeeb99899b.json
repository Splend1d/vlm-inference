                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about Mayan art and iconography, and it's asking what they prominently feature depictions of. The options are infants and children, stars and comets, love and sex, or mutilation and violence. Hmm, I need to recall what I know about Mayan art.\n\nFirst off, the Maya were an ancient Mesoamerican civilization known for their advanced achievements in astronomy, mathematics, and architecture. They created elaborate cities with pyramids and temples, and their art was deeply intertwined with their religious beliefs and practices.\n\nI remember that Mayan art often included religious themes, gods, and rituals. They were famous for their stelae, which are upright stone slabs carved with images and hieroglyphs, usually depicting rulers and significant events. These often show ceremonial activities, sometimes including sacrifices.\n\nNow, thinking about the options:\n\nA. Infants and children: I don't recall Mayan art focusing particularly on infants and children. Their art tends to emphasize adult figures, especially nobility and deities.\n\nB. Stars and comets: The Maya were renowned astronomers and had a deep understanding of celestial bodies. They tracked the movements of planets and stars, which were crucial for their calendar systems and religious ceremonies. So, it's plausible that their art would include depictions of stars and comets.\n\nC. Love and sex: While many cultures have art that explores themes of love and sexuality, I'm not sure if this was a primary focus in Mayan art. Their art does include representations of gods and goddesses, some of whom might be associated with love and fertility, but I think their art was more centered on political and religious power than on intimate themes.\n\nD. Mutilation and violence: The Maya are known for their practice of human sacrifice and bodily modifications like earlobe stretching and tooth filing. Their art often depicts warriors and captives, and there are scenes that show acts of violence and sacrifice. These images serve to demonstrate the power and dominance of the ruling class and the importance of bloodletting in their religious practices.\n\nConsidering all this, both stars and comets (option B) and mutilation and violence (option D) seem relevant to Mayan art. However, I need to determine which one is more prominently featured.\n\nLet me think about it differently. The Maya had a sophisticated calendar system and made significant astronomical observations, which were crucial for their agricultural and ceremonial cycles. Their art often includes symbols and depictions related to astronomy, such as the Milky Way, constellations, and celestial events like eclipses. So, stars and comets would certainly be part of their artistic repertoire.\n\nOn the other hand, mutilation and violence were integral to Mayan religious and political life. Sacrificial rituals, warfare, and the display of captives were common themes in their art, especially in their sculptural programs and murals.\n\nBut if I had to choose between the two, I might lean towards mutilation and violence being more prominently featured in their art. The reason is that Mayan art, particularly in public spaces and monuments, was used to reinforce the power and authority of the ruling class. Depictions of victorious warriors and sacrificial rituals would serve to demonstrate the ruler's divine right to govern and their connection to the gods.\n\nAdditionally, the Maya placed a strong emphasis on bloodletting as a means of communication with the gods. Rulers and nobles would perform self-mutilation rituals, such as drawing blood from their tongues or genitals, to offer to the deities. These acts were often depicted in art to showcase their piety and dedication.\n\nWhile astronomy was indeed important to the Maya, and they did depict celestial bodies and events in their art, I think the depiction of mutilation and violence was more central to their artistic expression, especially in public and monumental contexts.\n\nTo test my understanding, perhaps I should consider some specific examples. For instance, the famous Maya site of Tikal has numerous stelae that depict rulers and warriors in various ceremonial contexts, some of which show captives being humiliated or sacrificed. Similarly, the murals at Bonampak include detailed scenes of battles and captives being led to sacrifice.\n\nIn contrast, astronomical depictions might be more common in codices or on pottery, but even there, they are often combined with religious and ceremonial imagery that might include sacrificial themes.\n\nAnother point to consider is that Mayan art was not only about decoration but also about conveying complex ideological messages. Depictions of violence and sacrifice were means to communicate the Maya worldview, where such acts were necessary for maintaining cosmic order and ensuring the well-being of the community.\n\nIn summary, while astronomy played a significant role in Mayan culture and was represented in their art, the depiction of mutilation and violence was perhaps even more prominent, serving crucial functions in reinforcing political and religious authority.\n\nTherefore, I would answer that Mayan art and iconography prominently feature depictions of mutilation and violence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
