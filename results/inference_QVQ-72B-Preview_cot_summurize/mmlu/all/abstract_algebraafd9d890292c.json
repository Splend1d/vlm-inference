                    "text": "So I have this problem here: there's a transformation T from Z x Z to Z, and it's given that T(1,0) = 3 and T(0,1) = -5. I need to find T(-3,2). The options are A. -19, B. -10, C. 19, D. 10.\n\nAlright, first things first, Z is the set of integers, so Z x Z is the set of all ordered pairs of integers. T is a function that takes a pair of integers and maps them to a single integer. I need to figure out what T(-3,2) is based on the given values.\n\nSince T is a function from Z x Z to Z, and it's defined by T(1,0) = 3 and T(0,1) = -5, I suspect that T is a linear transformation over the integers. That is, T satisfies the properties of linearity: T(a,b) = a*T(1,0) + b*T(0,1) for any integers a and b.\n\nIf that's the case, then I can express T(-3,2) in terms of T(1,0) and T(0,1).\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nT(-3,2) = -3 * T(1,0) + 2 * T(0,1)\n\nI know T(1,0) = 3 and T(0,1) = -5, so:\n\nT(-3,2) = -3 * 3 + 2 * (-5) = -9 + (-10) = -19\n\nWait, but is T really a linear transformation? The problem doesn't specify that, so I might be assuming something that's not true. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps T is defined component-wise, but I don't have enough information to determine that.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe T is an operation defined on pairs of integers, like addition or something else, but again, without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps T is a homomorphism or has some group properties, but that seems too advanced for this context.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that T is a function that combines the inputs in a specific way. For example, T(a,b) could be a*a + b*b or a + b, but neither of these would match the given T(1,0) = 3 and T(0,1) = -5.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe T is defined as T(a,b) = 3a - 5b, based on the given values. Let's test this:\n\nIf T(a,b) = 3a - 5b, then T(1,0) = 3*1 - 5*0 = 3, which matches.\n\nAnd T(0,1) = 3*0 - 5*1 = -5, which also matches.\n\nSo, if this is the definition of T, then T(-3,2) = 3*(-3) - 5*2 = -9 - 10 = -19.\n\nBut again, I'm assuming that T is linear based on the given points. Maybe there's a different function that fits these points.\n\nAlternatively, suppose T is defined differently. Maybe T(a,b) = a + b + some constant, but that wouldn't fit the given values.\n\nWait, perhaps T is defined piecewise, and my assumption of linearity is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe T is a function that involves multiplication or exponentiation, but again, that doesn't seem likely based on the given values.\n\nLet me consider that Z x Z is a vector space over the integers, and T is a linear transformation from Z x Z to Z. In that case, T can be represented by a 1x2 matrix, say [c d], where T(a,b) = c*a + d*b.\n\nGiven that T(1,0) = c*1 + d*0 = c = 3, and T(0,1) = c*0 + d*1 = d = -5.\n\nSo, T(a,b) = 3a - 5b, and T(-3,2) = 3*(-3) - 5*2 = -9 - 10 = -19.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if T is not linear, maybe there's another way to interpret it, but the problem doesn't provide additional information to suggest that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps T is defined using some other operation, like T(a,b) = a - 2b, but that doesn't fit the given values.\n\nWait, maybe T is defined recursively, but without more information, that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps T is a function that maps (a,b) to 3a - 5b, as I initially thought.\n\nGiven that, T(-3,2) = 3*(-3) - 5*2 = -9 - 10 = -19.\n\nSo, according to this, the answer should be -19, which is option A.\n\nBut let's see if there's any possibility of another interpretation.\n\nSuppose T is not linear, but perhaps it's defined as T(a,b) = a + b + some function of a and b.\n\nFor example, T(a,b) = a + b + a*b.\n\nThen, T(1,0) = 1 + 0 + 1*0 = 1, which doesn't match the given T(1,0) = 3.\n\nSimilarly, T(0,1) = 0 + 1 + 0*1 = 1, which doesn't match T(0,1) = -5.\n\nSo, this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe T(a,b) = a^2 + b^2.\n\nThen, T(1,0) = 1 + 0 = 1 \u2260 3, and T(0,1) = 0 + 1 = 1 \u2260 -5.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAlternatively, T(a,b) = a - b.\n\nThen, T(1,0) = 1 - 0 = 1 \u2260 3, and T(0,1) = 0 - 1 = -1 \u2260 -5.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps T(a,b) = 3a - 5b, as I initially thought.\n\nThis matches the given points and gives T(-3,2) = -19.\n\nAlternatively, maybe T is defined differently, but without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects the answer based on the linear assumption.\n\nIn that case, T(-3,2) = -19, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, if there's a different interpretation, perhaps the answer could be different, but based on the information given, -19 seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming linearity.\n\nLet me consider if T is not necessarily linear.\n\nSuppose T is defined by T(a,b) = 3a - 5b + k, where k is some integer constant.\n\nThen, from T(1,0) = 3*1 - 5*0 + k = 3 + k = 3 \u21d2 k = 0.\n\nSimilarly, T(0,1) = 3*0 - 5*1 + k = -5 + k = -5 \u21d2 k = 0.\n\nSo, again, T(a,b) = 3a - 5b.\n\nThus, T(-3,2) = 3*(-3) - 5*2 = -9 - 10 = -19.\n\nAlternatively, if k is not zero, but that would contradict the given values.\n\nTherefore, k must be zero, and T(a,b) = 3a - 5b.\n\nHence, T(-3,2) = -19.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different function that fits the given points.\n\nSuppose T(a,b) = (3a - 5b) + m(a,b), where m(a,b) is some function that is zero for a=1, b=0 and a=0, b=1.\n\nBut that seems unnecessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps T is defined differently, but without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe T is a function that involves absolute values or something, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps T is a function that maps (a,b) to a - 2b, but that doesn't fit the given points.\n\nWait, T(1,0) = 1 - 0 = 1 \u2260 3, and T(0,1) = 0 - 2 = -2 \u2260 -5.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe T(a,b) = 3a - 5b, which matches the given points and gives T(-3,2) = -19.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps T is a function that maps (a,b) to a + b, but that doesn't fit the given points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps T is a function that maps (a,b) to a - b, but again, doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps T is a function that maps (a,b) to 3a - 5b, as initially thought.\n\nGiven that, and the fact that it matches the given points, I think it's safe to assume that T(a,b) = 3a - 5b.\n\nTherefore, T(-3,2) = 3*(-3) - 5*2 = -9 - 10 = -19.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. -19.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-19} \\]"
