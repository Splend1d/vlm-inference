                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"In which of the following is the negative end of the bond written last?\" And the options are A. O\u2014S, B. Br\u2014N, C. N\u2014C, D. P\u2014Cl. Okay, so I need to figure out which of these bonds has the negative end at the second atom listed.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what determines the polarity of a bond and where the negative end is. Bond polarity is determined by the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms. The atom with the higher electronegativity will have a partial negative charge, and the one with the lower electronegativity will have a partial positive charge.\n\nSo, in each of these bonds, the atom with the higher electronegativity will have the negative end, and the atom with the lower electronegativity will have the positive end.\n\nLet me list out the electronegativity values for each atom involved:\n\n- Oxygen (O): approximately 3.44\n\n- Sulfur (S): approximately 2.58\n\n- Bromine (Br): approximately 2.96\n\n- Nitrogen (N): approximately 3.04\n\n- Carbon (C): approximately 2.55\n\n- Phosphorus (P): approximately 2.19\n\n- Chlorine (Cl): approximately 3.16\n\nNow, for each bond, I need to compare the electronegativities of the two atoms and see which one has the higher value.\n\nStarting with A. O\u2014S:\n\nOxygen has 3.44 and sulfur has 2.58. So, oxygen is more electronegative, meaning the negative end is on oxygen. So, in O\u2014S, the negative end is O, which is the first atom. But the question says \"written last,\" so if O is first, that means the negative end is not last. So, probably not the answer.\n\nNext, B. Br\u2014N:\n\nBromine is 2.96 and nitrogen is 3.04. So, nitrogen has a slightly higher electronegativity than bromine. Therefore, the negative end is on nitrogen, which is the second atom. So, in this case, the negative end is written last.\n\nWait, but let's check the others to be sure.\n\nC. N\u2014C:\n\nNitrogen is 3.04 and carbon is 2.55. So, nitrogen is more electronegative, meaning the negative end is on nitrogen, which is the first atom again. Not last.\n\nD. P\u2014Cl:\n\nPhosphorus is 2.19 and chlorine is 3.16. So, chlorine is more electronegative, meaning the negative end is on chlorine, which is the second atom. So, in this case, the negative end is last.\n\nSo, both B and D have the negative end on the second atom. But the question is asking for which one is the negative end written last, so probably it's looking for the one where the second atom has the negative end.\n\nBut wait, in A and C, the first atom has the negative end, while in B and D, the second atom has the negative end.\n\nSo, both B and D have the negative end on the second atom, which is written last.\n\nBut the question seems to suggest choosing one option, so maybe there's something else to consider.\n\nLet me see if there's any other factor that could influence this.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the bond dipole direction. In covalent bonds between different atoms, the dipole points from the less electronegative atom to the more electronegative atom.\n\nSo, the negative end is on the more electronegative atom.\n\nIn B. Br\u2014N, nitrogen is more electronegative, so negative end is on nitrogen, which is second.\n\nIn D. P\u2014Cl, chlorine is more electronegative, so negative end is on chlorine, which is second.\n\nBut the question is asking for \"the negative end of the bond written last,\" meaning the second atom has the negative end.\n\nSo, both B and D fit this description.\n\nMaybe the question expects only one answer, so perhaps there's a exception or special case I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing the understanding of electronegativity differences and bond polarity.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the bond polarity based on the difference in electronegativity.\n\nFor example, in B. Br\u2014N, the difference is 3.04 - 2.96 = 0.08, which is a small difference, so the polarity is not very strong.\n\nIn D. P\u2014Cl, the difference is 3.16 - 2.19 = 0.97, which is a larger difference, so the polarity is stronger.\n\nBut the question is not asking for the degree of polarity, just which one has the negative end on the second atom.\n\nSo, both B and D have the negative end on the second atom.\n\nBut since the question asks for \"which of the following,\" and it's multiple choice with one expected answer, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet me double-check the electronegativity values.\n\nOxygen: 3.44, Sulfur: 2.58 \u2192 O more negative\n\nBromine: 2.96, Nitrogen: 3.04 \u2192 N more negative\n\nNitrogen: 3.04, Carbon: 2.55 \u2192 N more negative\n\nPhosphorus: 2.19, Chlorine: 3.16 \u2192 Cl more negative\n\nSo, in B and D, the second atom is more electronegative.\n\nBut in A and C, the first atom is more electronegative.\n\nSo, unless there's something unique about one of these options, both B and D should be correct.\n\nPerhaps the question has a typo, or maybe there's another way to interpret it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's considering the bond direction in a molecule, but that seems unlikely for such simple diatomic molecules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's considering the context of a larger molecule, but again, these are presented as individual bonds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's considering the conventional way of writing bonds, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's considering the formal charge, but in these simple bonds, the polarity is determined by electronegativity differences.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's considering the partial charges based on electronegativity.\n\nBut I think the initial approach is correct: compare electronegativities and determine the direction of the dipole.\n\nSo, since both B and D have the negative end on the second atom, and the question asks for \"the negative end of the bond written last,\" which would be the second atom, then both B and D fit.\n\nBut since it's a multiple-choice question with one expected answer, perhaps the answer is D. P\u2014Cl, because the difference in electronegativity is larger, making the polarity more pronounced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is B. Br\u2014N, because the difference is smaller, making it less polar, but that seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a specific reason to choose one over the other, but based on the information given, both seem to fit the criteria.\n\nGiven that, I might need to select one based on the question's phrasing.\n\nThe question says \"the negative end of the bond written last,\" which in both B and D is the case.\n\nBut since it's a multiple-choice question, perhaps there's a specific reason to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is D. P\u2014Cl, because chlorine has a higher electronegativity than phosphorus, and it's the second atom.\n\nSimilarly, in B. Br\u2014N, nitrogen has a higher electronegativity than bromine, and it's the second atom.\n\nBut again, both fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing the understanding that in certain bonds, despite common misconceptions, the negative end is on the second atom.\n\nIn that case, perhaps D. P\u2014Cl is the best answer, because phosphorus is less electronegative than chlorine, so chlorine carries the negative end.\n\nSimilarly, in B. Br\u2014N, nitrogen is more electronegative than bromine, so nitrogen carries the negative end.\n\nBut the question specifies \"written last,\" meaning the second atom has the negative end.\n\nSo, both B and D fit.\n\nUnless there's a specific reason to choose one over the other, I might need to consider that perhaps only one is correct based on some other factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is D. P\u2014Cl, because the difference in electronegativity is larger, making it more significant that the negative end is on chlorine.\n\nBut that seems like an arbitrary reason.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is B. Br\u2014N, because the difference is smaller, making it less polar, but that doesn't make much sense in this context.\n\nGiven all that, I'm a bit confused. Perhaps the answer is D. P\u2014Cl.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
