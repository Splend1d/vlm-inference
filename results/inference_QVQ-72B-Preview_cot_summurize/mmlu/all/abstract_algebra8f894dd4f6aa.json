                    "text": "I have this problem here: I need to find the sum of two polynomials, f(x) and g(x), in the polynomial ring Z_8[x]. The polynomials are f(x) = 4x - 5 and g(x) = 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 2. The answer choices are A. 2x\u00b2 + 5, B. 6x\u00b2 + 4x + 6, C. 0, and D. x\u00b2 + 1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Z_8[x] means. I believe Z_8 is the integers modulo 8, so any arithmetic with the coefficients of the polynomials should be done modulo 8.\n\nSo, to add these polynomials, I should add their corresponding coefficients and then take the result modulo 8.\n\nLet me write down the polynomials again:\n\nf(x) = 4x - 5\n\ng(x) = 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 2\n\nTo add them, I need to combine like terms. So, I'll add f(x) + g(x):\n\n(2x\u00b2) + (-4x) + (4x) + (-5) + 2\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm aligning the terms correctly. Maybe I should write them vertically:\n\ng(x):\n\n2x\u00b2 - 4x + 2\n\nf(x):\n\n0x\u00b2 + 4x - 5\n\nAdding them:\n\n2x\u00b2 + (4 - 4)x + (-5 + 2)\n\nWait, no. Let's be careful with the signs.\n\nActually, f(x) = 4x - 5 can be written as 0x\u00b2 + 4x - 5.\n\nSo, adding f(x) and g(x):\n\n(2x\u00b2 + 0x\u00b2) + (-4x + 4x) + (2 - 5)\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n2x\u00b2 + 0x - (-3)\n\nWhich is:\n\n2x\u00b2 + 0x + 3\n\nBut now, considering the coefficients modulo 8.\n\nSo, 2 mod 8 is 2\n\n0 mod 8 is 0\n\nAnd 3 mod 8 is 3.\n\nSo, the sum should be 2x\u00b2 + 0x + 3, which is just 2x\u00b2 + 3.\n\nBut that's not exactly matching any of the options directly. Maybe I made a mistake in adding the constants.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nf(x) = 4x - 5\n\ng(x) = 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 2\n\nAdding them:\n\n2x\u00b2 + (4x - 4x) + (-5 + 2)\n\nWhich is 2x\u00b2 + 0x -3\n\nSo, 2x\u00b2 - 3.\n\nNow, in Z_8, -3 is equivalent to 5, since -3 + 8 = 5.\n\nSo, 2x\u00b2 - 3 mod 8 is 2x\u00b2 + 5.\n\nWait, that's option A: 2x\u00b2 + 5.\n\nBut in my first calculation, I had 2x\u00b2 + 3, which is the same as 2x\u00b2 + 5 in Z_8, since 3 \u2261 5 mod 8 is not correct. Wait, 5 - 3 is 2, which is not a multiple of 8, so that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, actually, -3 + 8 = 5, so in Z_8, -3 is equivalent to 5.\n\nSo, 2x\u00b2 - 3 = 2x\u00b2 + 5 in Z_8[x].\n\nTherefore, the sum is 2x\u00b2 + 5.\n\nBut looking back at the options, A is 2x\u00b2 + 5, which matches my calculation.\n\nHowever, I should double-check if there are any other steps or if I missed something.\n\nLet me verify the addition again.\n\nf(x) = 4x - 5\n\ng(x) = 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 2\n\nAdding term by term:\n\n- The highest degree term is 2x\u00b2, since g(x) has it and f(x) doesn't.\n\n- For the x term: 4x + (-4x) = 0x\n\n- For the constant term: -5 + 2 = -3\n\nSo, f(x) + g(x) = 2x\u00b2 + 0x - 3\n\nNow, in Z_8, -3 is equivalent to 5, because -3 + 8 = 5.\n\nSo, 2x\u00b2 + 0x - 3 = 2x\u00b2 + 5 in Z_8[x].\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. 2x\u00b2 + 5.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing something about polynomial addition in Z_8[x].\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider each coefficient separately and reduce modulo 8.\n\nThe coefficients are:\n\n- For x\u00b2: 2\n\n- For x: 4 + (-4) = 0\n\n- For the constant term: -5 + 2 = -3\n\nNow, reducing each coefficient modulo 8:\n\n- 2 mod 8 = 2\n\n- 0 mod 8 = 0\n\n- -3 mod 8 = 5\n\nSo, the sum is indeed 2x\u00b2 + 0x + 5, which simplifies to 2x\u00b2 + 5.\n\nI think I've got it right. The answer is A. 2x\u00b2 + 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 2x^{2} + 5} \\]"
