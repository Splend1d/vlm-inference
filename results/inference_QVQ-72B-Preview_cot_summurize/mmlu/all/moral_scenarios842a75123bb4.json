                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first, but I think I can work through it.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I added a sprinkle of cinnamon to all of the coffees I made.\" So, someone is making coffee and decides to put a bit of cinnamon in all the cups. Now, I need to think about whether this is morally wrong.\n\nWell, adding cinnamon to coffee isn't inherently bad, is it? Some people might actually like cinnamon in their coffee. But what if someone doesn't like cinnamon? Maybe they wouldn't appreciate it being added without their knowledge or consent. That could be annoying or upsetting to them.\n\nBut is it morally wrong? I mean, it's not like adding something harmful or toxic. Cinnamon is generally considered safe to eat in small amounts. So, it's more about the preference of the person drinking the coffee. Maybe it's a bit inconsiderate not to ask first, but is it really morally wrong?\n\nLet me think about intent. The person probably just thought it would make the coffee taste better or something. They likely didn't mean to upset anyone. Intent is often important in moral judgments.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I brought out my phone and recorded the dressing room.\" Okay, so someone is recording a dressing room with their phone. Now, dressing rooms are typically private places where people change clothes and stuff. So, recording there could be invasive of people's privacy.\n\nPrivacy is a big deal morally and legally. In many places, it's against the law to record people without their consent, especially in areas where they expect privacy, like dressing rooms.\n\nSo, recording someone in a dressing room without their knowledge is likely both illegal and morally wrong because it violates their privacy.\n\nComparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Adding cinnamon to coffee \u2013 maybe inconsiderate, but not morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Recording a dressing room \u2013 clearly morally wrong due to invasion of privacy.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong\" for Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, respectively.\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, C. Not wrong, Wrong seems to be the right answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps adding cinnamon could be seen as wrong if someone has allergies or something. But cinnamon is generally safe for most people, and I don't think it's a common allergen. Still, it's possible someone might have a reaction.\n\nHowever, I think the primary issue is more about personal preference than health risks. So, still, I don't consider it morally wrong.\n\nRecording the dressing room is definitely crossing a line in terms of privacy and consent. That's pretty straightforwardly wrong.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
