                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario. There's a brother and his sister, who's 15 years old, and they've just left a movie theater at night. They're walking to their car in a dimly lit parking lot. There's a defendant who's drunk and comes out from behind a trash can. He attacks the brother, knocks him down, hits him with the trash can, and the brother passes out. Then the defendant forces the sister into the car and rapes her.\n\nNow, the defendant is charged with assault with intent to commit rape, specifically based on his attack on the brother. I need to find out what the defendant's best defense would be from the options given.\n\nFirst, let's understand the charge: assault with intent to commit rape. So, the prosecution needs to prove that the defendant assaulted the brother with the specific intent to commit rape.\n\nOption A says that although the sister was 15, she appeared to be 16 to a reasonable man. Hmm, that seems relevant because the age of the sister might be important in terms of consent or other legal considerations. But I'm not sure how this directly affects the charge of assault with intent to commit rape based on the attack on the brother.\n\nOption B is that the defendant did not intend to rape the sister. Well, the charge is based on the assault on the brother with the intent to commit rape. So, if the defendant didn't intend to rape the sister, maybe that could undermine the prosecution's case. But the defendant did rape the sister, so claiming he didn't intend to might not be very credible.\n\nOption C says that the defendant's intoxication negated the required general intent. Assault with intent to commit rape requires specific intent, right? So, intoxication might affect the defendant's ability to form that specific intent. But I think intoxication can sometimes be a defense if it's so severe that it prevents the formation of intent, but it's not usually a valid defense for general intent crimes.\n\nOption D is that it's impossible to prove the defendant was the perpetrator because the parking lot was dimly lit. This seems like a challenge to the identification of the defendant. If the witnesses couldn't see clearly due to poor lighting, maybe there's reasonable doubt about who actually committed the crime.\n\nNow, considering these options, I need to think about which one is the strongest defense.\n\nFirst, option A seems weak because even if the sister appeared 16, the defendant still raped her, which is a crime regardless of her appearance.\n\nOption B seems unlikely because the defendant did rape the sister, so claiming he didn't intend to might not hold up well in court.\n\nOption C mentions intoxication negating general intent. But in this case, it's specific intent that's required for the charge. Intoxication might affect specific intent, but I'm not sure how it applies here.\n\nOption D challenges the identification of the defendant as the perpetrator, which could be a strong defense if there's doubt about who committed the act.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, the defendant was seen emerging from behind a trash can and attacking the brother. Even if the lighting was dim, there might be other evidence like DNA from the rape that could identify the defendant.\n\nAlso, the brother was knocked unconscious, but maybe he saw the defendant before passing out or there are other witnesses.\n\nBut if the lighting was poor, perhaps the brother couldn't identify the defendant clearly.\n\nStill, the rape occurred, and there might be forensic evidence linking the defendant to the crime.\n\nSo, perhaps option D is not the strongest defense because there might be other evidence besides eyewitness identification.\n\nWait, but the question is about the best defense based on the given options.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nOption A is about the sister's age appearance, which doesn't directly relate to the charge against the defendant for assaulting the brother with intent to commit rape.\n\nOption B claims no intent to rape the sister, but since he did rape her, it seems contradictory.\n\nOption C talks about intoxication negating general intent, but the charge requires specific intent.\n\nOption D challenges the identification of the defendant as the perpetrator due to poor lighting.\n\nBetween these, option D seems like a plausible defense because if the identification is uncertain due to poor lighting, it could cast reasonable doubt on whether the defendant was indeed the person who committed the assault.\n\nHowever, considering that the defendant was seen emerging from behind a trash can and attacking the brother, and that the sister was raped, there might be other evidence linking him to the crime, such as DNA evidence from the rape.\n\nBut the question specifies that the parking lot was dimly lit, which could affect identification.\n\nPerhaps the brother was unconscious and couldn't identify the defendant, and the sister was in shock and couldn't see clearly.\n\nBut again, there might be other evidence like surveillance footage or DNA.\n\nBut based on the information given, option D seems like the strongest defense among the choices provided.\n\nOption C seems weak because intoxication doesn't typically negate specific intent in most jurisdictions, especially for serious crimes like this.\n\nOption B is contradicted by the defendant's actions.\n\nOption A is irrelevant to the charge against the defendant for assaulting the brother.\n\nTherefore, the best defense is option D: it is impossible to prove that the defendant was the perpetrator because the parking lot was dimly lit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
