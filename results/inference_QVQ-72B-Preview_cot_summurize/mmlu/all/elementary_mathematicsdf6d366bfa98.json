                    "text": "So I have this problem: 0.32 grams is equal to how many centigrams. The options are 32, 3.2, 3200, and 320. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what a centigram is. I know that \"centi-\" means one-hundredth, so 1 gram is equal to 100 centigrams. So, if I have 0.32 grams, I need to find out how many centigrams that is.\n\nLet me think about this. If 1 gram is 100 centigrams, then 0.1 grams would be 10 centigrams because 0.1 is one-tenth of a gram, and 10 is one-tenth of 100 centigrams.\n\nSo, 0.1 grams = 10 centigrams\n\nSimilarly, 0.01 grams would be 1 centigram, since 0.01 is one-hundredth of a gram, and 1 is one-hundredth of 100 centigrams.\n\nWait, but 0.01 grams is actually 10 milligrams, not 1 centigram. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing myself.\n\nLet me try a different approach. I know that \"centi-\" means one-hundredth, so 1 gram is divided into 100 equal parts, and each part is 1 centigram.\n\nSo, to convert grams to centigrams, I need to multiply by 100.\n\nFor example, 2 grams is 200 centigrams because 2 times 100 is 200.\n\nSimilarly, 0.5 grams is 50 centigrams because 0.5 times 100 is 50.\n\nSo, applying this to 0.32 grams, I need to multiply 0.32 by 100 to get the number of centigrams.\n\nLet me calculate that: 0.32 times 100.\n\nFirst, 0.3 times 100 is 30.\n\nThen, 0.02 times 100 is 2.\n\nSo, 30 plus 2 equals 32 centigrams.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the decimal places. Multiplying by 100 means moving the decimal point two places to the right.\n\nSo, 0.32 grams times 100 would be 32 centigrams.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Maybe using fractions.\n\n1 gram = 100 centigrams.\n\nSo, 0.32 grams is the same as 32/100 of a gram.\n\nSo, 32/100 grams times 100 centigrams/gram.\n\nThat should give 32 centigrams.\n\nWait, but 32/100 of a gram times 100 centigrams per gram is indeed 32 centigrams.\n\nSo, this confirms that 0.32 grams is equal to 32 centigrams.\n\nBut let me see if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nMaybe thinking in terms of milligrams first.\n\nI know that 1 gram = 1000 milligrams, and 1 milligram = 0.1 centigrams.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Actually, 1 milligram is 0.1 centigrams?\n\nLet me recall: 1 centigram is 10 milligrams, because 1 gram is 100 centigrams and 1000 milligrams.\n\nSo, 1 centigram = 10 milligrams.\n\nTherefore, 1 milligram = 0.1 centigrams.\n\nBut this seems to be getting more complicated. Maybe I should stick with the original method of multiplying by 100.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the fact that \"centi-\" means one-hundredth, so 1 gram = 100 centigrams.\n\nTherefore, to convert any amount in grams to centigrams, I just need to multiply by 100.\n\nSo, 0.32 grams \u00d7 100 = 32 centigrams.\n\nYes, this seems consistent.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider the options again:\n\nA. 32\n\nB. 3.2\n\nC. 3,200\n\nD. 320\n\nGiven that 0.32 grams is 32 centigrams, option A seems correct.\n\nBut let me check why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption B: 3.2 centigrams.\n\nThat would be 0.032 grams because 3.2 \u00f7 100 = 0.032 grams.\n\nBut the original amount is 0.32 grams, which is larger than 0.032 grams.\n\nOption C: 3,200 centigrams.\n\nThat would be 32 grams because 3,200 \u00f7 100 = 32 grams.\n\nBut the original amount is 0.32 grams, which is much smaller.\n\nOption D: 320 centigrams.\n\nThat would be 3.2 grams because 320 \u00f7 100 = 3.2 grams.\n\nAgain, that's larger than 0.32 grams.\n\nTherefore, option A: 32 centigrams is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me summarize:\n\n- 1 gram = 100 centigrams\n\n- Therefore, to convert grams to centigrams, multiply by 100\n\n- 0.32 grams \u00d7 100 = 32 centigrams\n\nYes, that's straightforward.\n\nI think I might have overthought this initially, but it's good to have confirmed it through different approaches.\n\nSo, the answer is A. 32.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 32} \\]"
