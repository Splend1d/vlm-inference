                    "text": "So I have this question here about abelian groups, specifically about free abelian groups and torsion elements. There are two statements, and I need to determine which ones are true. Let me try to understand each statement one by one.\n\nFirst statement: \"Every free abelian group is torsion free.\"\n\nOkay, so I need to recall what a free abelian group is and what it means for a group to be torsion free.\n\nA free abelian group is an abelian group that has a basis, meaning that every element of the group can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of the basis elements with integer coefficients. For example, the integers under addition, \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), is a free abelian group with basis \\(\\{1\\}\\), and the direct sum of two copies of integers, \\(\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\), has basis \\(\\{(1,0), (0,1)\\}\\).\n\nNow, a group is torsion free if it has no elements of finite order besides the identity. In other words, for any non-identity element \\(g\\) in the group, \\(ng \\neq 0\\) for all non-zero integers \\(n\\).\n\nSo, is every free abelian group torsion free?\n\nLet me think about it. Take \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), which is free abelian. Is it torsion free? Let's see, take any non-zero integer \\(n\\), and any non-zero element \\(m \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). Then \\(n \\cdot m = n m\\), which is zero only if \\(m = 0\\) or \\(n = 0\\). So, yes, no torsion elements besides the identity.\n\nWhat about \\(\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\)? Take an element \\((m, n)\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are non-zero integers. Then \\(k \\cdot (m, n) = (k m, k n)\\), which is zero only if \\(k = 0\\). So again, no torsion elements besides the identity.\n\nHmm, seems like in free abelian groups, only the identity element has finite order.\n\nIs there a general proof for this?\n\nLet's consider a free abelian group \\(F\\) with basis \\(\\{e_i \\mid i \\in I\\}\\), where \\(I\\) is some index set.\n\nAny element \\(x \\in F\\) can be written uniquely as \\(x = n_1 e_{i_1} + n_2 e_{i_2} + \\dots + n_k e_{i_k}\\), where \\(n_j \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) and \\(e_{i_j}\\) are distinct basis elements.\n\nSuppose \\(x\\) is non-zero, so at least one \\(n_j \\neq 0\\).\n\nNow, consider \\(m x = m(n_1 e_{i_1} + \\dots + n_k e_{i_k}) = m n_1 e_{i_1} + \\dots + m n_k e_{i_k}\\).\n\nFor \\(m x = 0\\), each coefficient must be zero because the basis elements are linearly independent.\n\nSo, \\(m n_j = 0\\) for all \\(j\\).\n\nIf \\(n_j \\neq 0\\), then \\(m\\) must be a multiple of \\(n_j\\).\n\nBut since \\(n_j\\) is an integer, the smallest positive integer \\(m\\) such that \\(m n_j = 0\\) is only possible if \\(n_j = 0\\), which contradicts our assumption that \\(x\\) is non-zero.\n\nTherefore, the only element with finite order is the identity.\n\nSo, yes, every free abelian group is torsion free.\n\nAlright, that seems solid.\n\nNow, second statement: \"Every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group.\"\n\nHmm, this seems a bit trickier.\n\nI know that finitely generated abelian groups have a classification theorem.\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups states that every finitely generated abelian group \\(G\\) can be expressed as a direct sum of cyclic groups.\n\nSpecifically, \\(G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{n_1} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{n_2} \\oplus \\dots \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{n_k} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\dots \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\), where each \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{n_i}\\) is a finite cyclic group of order \\(n_i\\), and the number of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)'s is the rank of \\(G\\).\n\nNow, if \\(G\\) is torsion-free, that means it has no elements of finite order besides the identity.\n\nLooking at the decomposition, the finite cyclic groups \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{n_i}\\) contribute torsion elements.\n\nTherefore, for \\(G\\) to be torsion-free, there must be no \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{n_i}\\) terms in its decomposition.\n\nSo, \\(G\\) must be isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}^r\\), where \\(r\\) is the rank.\n\nBut wait, is that always the case?\n\nLet me think about it.\n\nSuppose \\(G\\) is finitely generated, torsion-free, and abelian.\n\nAccording to the structure theorem, \\(G\\) decomposes into a direct sum of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)'s.\n\nSo, yes, \\(G\\) is a free abelian group.\n\nWait, but is there any exception or something I'm missing here?\n\nLet me consider an example.\n\nTake \\(G = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\). It's finitely generated, torsion-free, and abelian. Is it a free abelian group?\n\nYes, because it's isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\), which is free.\n\nAnother example: \\(G = \\mathbb{Z}\\). Clearly, it's free abelian.\n\nWhat if \\(G = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\)? Well, that's not torsion-free because \\(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\) has torsion.\n\nSo, in all cases where \\(G\\) is finitely generated, abelian, and torsion-free, it seems to be a free abelian group.\n\nWait, but I recall that there's a concept called \"torsion-free abelian groups\" that are not necessarily free, but maybe that's only for infinitely generated groups.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nFor infinitely generated groups, there are torsion-free abelian groups that are not free, like the additive group of rational numbers \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), which is torsion-free but not free.\n\nBut in this statement, we're dealing with finitely generated groups.\n\nSo, perhaps the key here is that finitely generated torsion-free abelian groups are always free.\n\nYes, that aligns with the structure theorem.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true.\n\nWait a minute, but the options are:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nSo, if both statements are true, then the answer should be A. True, True.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nFirst statement: Every free abelian group is torsion free.\n\nAs I argued, yes, that seems correct.\n\nSecond statement: Every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group.\n\nAgain, based on the structure theorem, this seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to look at it.\n\nIs there any chance that a finitely generated torsion-free abelian group isn't free?\n\nWell, if it's not specified to be free, but torsion-free, then perhaps there are other possibilities, but in the finitely generated case, the structure theorem guarantees that it's a direct sum of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)'s.\n\nSo, I think both statements are true.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
