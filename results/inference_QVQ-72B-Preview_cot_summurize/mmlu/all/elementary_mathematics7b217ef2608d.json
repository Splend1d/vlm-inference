                    "text": "Let's see. There's this problem about a discount on in-line skates. The skates usually cost $110.99, and there's a 10% discount. I need to find out how much they'll cost after the discount, excluding tax. The options are A. $99.89, B. $99.99, C. $100.99, and D. $109.88.\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract that from the original price to get the sale price.\n\nSo, the original price is $110.99, and the discount is 10%. To find 10% of $110.99, I can multiply $110.99 by 10% or 0.10.\n\nLet me do that calculation:\n\n$110.99 \u00d7 0.10 = ?\n\nWell, multiplying by 0.10 is the same as moving the decimal point one place to the left. So, $110.99 becomes $11.099. But that doesn't make sense because money is typically\u7cbe\u786e\u5230 cents, not beyond that. So, probably, it's $11.10.\n\nWait, but $110.99 \u00d7 0.10: 0.99 \u00d7 0.10 is 0.099, and 110 \u00d7 0.10 is $11.00. So, $11.00 plus $0.099 is $11.099, which rounds to $11.10.\n\nSo, the discount is $11.10.\n\nNow, subtract that from the original price:\n\n$110.99 - $11.10 = ?\n\nLet's see, $110.99 minus $11.10.\n\nWell, $110.99 minus $11.00 is $99.99, and then minus the extra $0.10 would be $99.89.\n\nWait, but $99.99 minus $0.10 is $99.89, yes.\n\nSo, the final price after the discount should be $99.89.\n\nLooking back at the options, A. $99.89.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate 90% of the original price, since 100% - 10% = 90%.\n\nSo, 90% of $110.99 is $110.99 \u00d7 0.90.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n$110.99 \u00d7 0.90 = ?\n\nFirst, $110 \u00d7 0.90 = $99.00.\n\nThen, $0.99 \u00d7 0.90 = $0.891, which rounds to $0.89.\n\nSo, $99.00 + $0.89 = $99.89.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. $99.89.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any errors in this calculation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 99.89} \\]"
