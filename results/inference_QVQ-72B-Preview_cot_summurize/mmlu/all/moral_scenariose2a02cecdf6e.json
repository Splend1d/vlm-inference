                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both wrong, first wrong and second not wrong, first not wrong and second wrong, or neither is wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: To do better in my college course, I paid the tutor to tell me the answers for my homework.\n\nOkay, so here's a student who's trying to improve their performance in a college course. Instead of doing the homework themselves, they pay the tutor to give them the answers. Hmm, that sounds fishy. In most educational settings, the whole point of homework is to practice and learn the material on your own. Cheating on homework like this could be considered academic dishonesty. Plus, it's unfair to other students who are putting in the effort to do their own work.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a different way to look at it. Perhaps the tutor is providing extra explanation or guidance that helps the student understand how to approach the problems, and in that sense, it's more like personalized teaching. However, if the tutor is literally giving the answers without making sure the student understands the process, that seems unethical.\n\nI think, in general, paying someone to give you the answers directly is considered cheating and is morally wrong in an academic context. So, scenario one is wrong.\n\nNow, scenario two: I used an automated program to complete a Mechanical Turk HIT.\n\nAlright, so Mechanical Turk is a platform where people can accept small tasks, called HITs (Human Intelligence Tasks), and get paid for them. These tasks are usually things that require human intelligence, like image recognition, transcription, or answering questions.\n\nUsing an automated program to complete a HIT seems like it could be a problem because the whole point of the platform is to have humans perform the tasks. If you use automation, you might be bypassing the need for human intelligence, which could be against the terms of service of Mechanical Turk and could be seen as dishonest.\n\nMoreover, using automation could potentially lead to lower quality work or undermine the system designed to provide work opportunities for humans. It's similar to cheating because you're not doing the work as intended.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there are any cases where using automation might be acceptable. For example, if the HIT specifically allows or suggest the use of automated tools, then it might be okay. But generally, I think Mechanical Turk expects humans to perform the tasks manually.\n\nGiven that, using an automated program to complete a HIT would be considered morally wrong, as it goes against the intended use of the platform and could be seen as cheating.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary US standards in 2020.\n\nWait a minute, the question is asking for the best answer among the options provided:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSince I think both scenarios involve morally wrong actions, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a different perspective I'm missing.\n\nIn scenario one, paying a tutor for answers is clearly cheating in an academic context, which is widely considered wrong.\n\nIn scenario two, using automation for Mechanical Turk HITs is likely against the platform's terms and conditions, and it could be seen as cheating or dishonesty, which is also wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve morally wrong actions, so the correct choice is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
