                    "text": "So I have this problem here: I need to find the minimum value of the expression \\(x + 4z\\) as a function defined on \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\), subject to the constraint \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\leq 2\\). The options are 0, -2, \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\), or \\(-\\sqrt{35}\\).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I have a function \\(f(x, y, z) = x + 4z\\), and I have a constraint that the points \\((x, y, z)\\) must lie inside or on the surface of a sphere of radius \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) centered at the origin. So, I need to find the minimum value of \\(f\\) over this region.\n\nSince the constraint is an inequality, \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\leq 2\\), it defines a solid sphere, not just the surface. However, the minimum or maximum values on the interior of the sphere might not be relevant if the function decreases or increases as we move towards the center or away from it.\n\nI recall that to find extrema in a constrained region, Lagrange multipliers are often used, but since this is an inequality constraint, I might need to consider the method of Lagrange multipliers with inequality constraints, which can be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can parameterize the constraint and search for extrema on the boundary.\n\nGiven that the constraint is a sphere, the boundary is \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2\\). Maybe I can look for extrema on this surface and then check if there are any interior points where the function could be smaller.\n\nFirst, let's consider the boundary: \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2\\).\n\nI can use Lagrange multipliers for this. I need to set up the Lagrangian:\n\n\\[\\mathcal{L}(x, y, z, \\lambda) = x + 4z + \\lambda (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2)\\]\n\nNow, I take the partial derivatives and set them to zero:\n\n\\[\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x} = 1 + 2\\lambda x = 0\\]\\[\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y} = 2\\lambda y = 0\\]\\[\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial z} = 4 + 2\\lambda z = 0\\]\\[\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\lambda} = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2 = 0\\]\n\nFrom the second equation: \\(2\\lambda y = 0\\). This implies either \\(\\lambda = 0\\) or \\(y = 0\\).\n\nBut if \\(\\lambda = 0\\), then from the first equation: \\(1 + 2\\lambda x = 1 + 0 = 1 \\neq 0\\), which is not possible. Therefore, \\(y = 0\\).\n\nFrom the first equation: \\(1 + 2\\lambda x = 0 \\implies \\lambda = -\\frac{1}{2x}\\)\n\nFrom the third equation: \\(4 + 2\\lambda z = 0 \\implies \\lambda = -\\frac{2}{z}\\)\n\nSo, setting the expressions for \\(\\lambda\\):\n\n\\[-\\frac{1}{2x} = -\\frac{2}{z}\\]\\[\\frac{1}{2x} = \\frac{2}{z}\\]\\[z = 4x\\]\n\nNow, since \\(y = 0\\), and \\(z = 4x\\), plug into the constraint:\n\n\\[x^2 + 0^2 + (4x)^2 = 2\\]\\[x^2 + 16x^2 = 2\\]\\[17x^2 = 2\\]\\[x^2 = \\frac{2}{17}\\]\\[x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\]\\[z = 4x = \\pm 4\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\]\n\nNow, evaluate \\(f(x, z) = x + 4z\\):\n\nFor \\(x = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\), \\(z = 4\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\):\n\n\\[f = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} + 4 \\times 4\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} + 16\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} = 17\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 17} = \\sqrt{34}\\]\n\nFor \\(x = -\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\), \\(z = -4\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\):\n\n\\[f = -\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} - 16\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} = -17\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} = -\\sqrt{2 \\times 17} = -\\sqrt{34}\\]\n\nSo, on the boundary, the minimum value is \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\) and the maximum is \\(\\sqrt{34}\\).\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any interior points where the function could be smaller than \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\).\n\nSince the constraint includes the interior of the sphere, I need to consider points inside the sphere where \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 < 2\\).\n\nTo see if the function can be smaller than \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\) inside the sphere, I can analyze the behavior of \\(f(x, y, z) = x + 4z\\) as we move towards the center.\n\nLet's consider the gradient of \\(f\\), which is \\(\\nabla f = (1, 0, 4)\\). This tells us the direction of maximum increase of \\(f\\). So, moving in the direction opposite to the gradient would decrease \\(f\\).\n\nHowever, on the boundary, we've already found the minimum value of \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\). If I move inside the sphere towards the center, the function \\(f\\) might change, but I need to see if it can decrease further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers for the boundary and then check the function's value at the center.\n\nAt the center of the sphere, which is at the origin \\((0, 0, 0)\\):\n\n\\[f(0, 0, 0) = 0 + 4 \\times 0 = 0\\]\n\nWhich is larger than \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\), so it's not a candidate for the minimum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider moving away from the boundary in a direction where \\(f\\) decreases.\n\nBut since the constraint includes the interior, and the boundary gives me the minimal value of \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\), I need to check if inside the sphere, \\(f\\) can be less than that.\n\nSuppose I fix \\(y = 0\\) and \\(z = 4x\\), as I found earlier, and consider points inside the sphere.\n\nThen, \\(x^2 + 0^2 + (4x)^2 < 2\\), which is \\(x^2 + 16x^2 < 2\\), or \\(17x^2 < 2\\), so \\(x^2 < \\frac{2}{17}\\), which is the same as on the boundary.\n\nAt these points, \\(f(x, z) = x + 4z = x + 16x = 17x\\).\n\nSince \\(x^2 < \\frac{2}{17}\\), \\(x\\) can be greater than \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\) or less than \\(-\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\).\n\nBut wait, \\(x^2 < \\frac{2}{17}\\) implies \\(|x| < \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\), so \\(x\\) can be between \\(-\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(f(x, z) = 17x\\) can take values between \\(17(-\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}) = -\\sqrt{34}\\) and \\(17(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}) = \\sqrt{34}\\).\n\nSo, inside the sphere, \\(f\\) can approach \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\) but cannot go below it because \\(x\\) cannot be less than \\(-\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\).\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of \\(f\\) subject to the constraint is \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\), achieved on the boundary at the point \\((x, y, z) = (-\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}, 0, -4\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}})\\).\n\nHence, the answer should be \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0\n\nB. -2\n\nC. -\u221a34\n\nD. -\u221a35\n\nSo, option C is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-\\sqrt{34}} \\]"
