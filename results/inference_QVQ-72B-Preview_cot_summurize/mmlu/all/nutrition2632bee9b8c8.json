                    "text": "So I have this question about treating Bulimia Nervosa, and there are four options. I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, option A says that Fluoxetine is considered of benefit for treating Bulimia Nervosa. I remember that Fluoxetine is an antidepressant, and it's often used to treat various mental health conditions, including some eating disorders. But is it specifically beneficial for Bulimia Nervosa? I think it might be, but I'm not entirely sure about the evidence behind it.\n\nOption B says that the first approach is to discuss body image with the patient. That seems logical because body image issues are a big part of Bulimia Nervosa. People with Bulimia often have distorted perceptions of their body size and shape, so addressing these perceptions might be an important part of treatment. But is it always the first step? Maybe it depends on the individual case and the therapist's approach.\n\nOption C states that it's not useful to discuss weight with patients who have Bulimia Nervosa. Hmm, that seems counterintuitive. Weight is often a sensitive topic for people with eating disorders, but avoiding it altogether might not be helpful. In fact, it might be necessary to talk about weight to help them develop a healthier relationship with food and their body. So, I'm thinking this might not be correct.\n\nOption D suggests that treatments should target exclusively on purging practices. While purging is a key symptom of Bulimia Nervosa, focusing only on that might not address the underlying issues. There are usually deeper psychological and emotional factors at play, so a more comprehensive approach might be necessary. So, this seems too narrow.\n\nLet me summarize what I think:\n\n- Option A: Fluoxetine might be beneficial, but I need to confirm.\n\n- Option B: Discussing body image is important, but may not always be the first step.\n\n- Option C: Not discussing weight seems incorrect.\n\n- Option D: Focusing only on purging practices seems too limited.\n\nI should look up some guidelines or research about treating Bulimia Nervosa to find the correct answer.\n\nOkay, after a quick search, I find that Fluoxetine is indeed approved for the treatment of Bulimia Nervosa. It's been shown to reduce the frequency of binge-eating and purging behaviors. So, option A seems correct.\n\nRegarding option B, while discussing body image is important, treatment approaches can vary. Some therapies might start by building a therapeutic alliance or addressing immediate health concerns. So, it's probably not always the first approach.\n\nOption C contradicts what I've learned. Discussing weight is often necessary in treating Bulimia Nervosa, although it should be handled sensitively.\n\nOption D is too restrictive. Effective treatments for Bulimia Nervosa typically address a range of issues, including but not limited to purging behaviors.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A: Fluoxetine is considered of benefit for the treatment of Bulimia Nervosa.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
