I'm pretty sure I know about Shiva and Vishnu; they're like the main gods in Hinduism, right? And Brahma, I think he's important too. But Sanskrit sounds different. Let me think carefully.\n\nFirst, Shiva is one of the principal deities in Hinduism, part of the Trimurti, which includes Brahma and Vishnu. He's often associated with destruction and regeneration. So, Shiva is definitely a Hindu deity.\n\nNext, Vishnu is another member of the Trimurti, known as the preserver of the universe. He's believed to descend to earth in various avatars, like Rama and Krishna. So, Vishnu is also a Hindu deity.\n\nThen there's Brahma, who is part of the Trimurti as well, responsible for creation. Although he's not as prominently worshiped as Shiva or Vishnu, he's still a Hindu deity.\n\nNow, Sanskrit. I know Sanskrit is a language. It's an ancient Indo-Aryan language, and it's considered the classical language of Indian literature and Hindu texts. But it's not a deity; it's a means of communication, a script used to write sacred texts like the Vedas and Upanishads.\n\nSo, comparing the options:\n\nA. Shiva \u2013 definitely a deity.\n\nB. Vishnu \u2013 definitely a deity.\n\nC. Sanskrit \u2013 a language, not a deity.\n\nD. Brahma \u2013 definitely a deity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Sanskrit, because it's not a Hindu deity; it's a language.\n\nWait a minute, just to make sure, maybe there's some confusion here. Is there any chance that Sanskrit could be mistakenly identified as a deity? Let me check. In Hinduism, there is a concept of Sound Brahman, where sound is considered a manifestation of the divine, and Sanskrit is often revered as a sacred language. But still, it's not a deity in the same way that Shiva, Vishnu, or Brahma are.\n\nAlso, sometimes, the goddess Saraswati is associated with knowledge and language, but she isn't referred to as Sanskrit specifically. So, I think it's safe to say that Sanskrit is a language and not a Hindu deity.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll double-check a few reliable sources to confirm. Let's see:\n\n- Shiva: undeniably a major Hindu god.\n\n- Vishnu: similarly, a principal Hindu deity.\n\n- Brahma: part of the Hindu pantheon, though less emphasized in modern times.\n\n- Sanskrit: recognized as a classical language and the liturgical language of Hinduism.\n\nYes, this aligns with what I thought. So, the answer is C. Sanskrit.\n\nI think that's solid. No need to overthink it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Sanskrit}} \\]"
