                    "text": "Let's see here. Melanie is buying apples and oranges. Apples cost $1 each, and oranges cost $2 each. She's already spent all her lunch money, and now we need to figure out if she's maximizing her utility with her current consumption choices. If not, what should she do to maximize it?\n\nFirst, I need to remember what utility maximization is. Utility is a measure of satisfaction or happiness that Melanie gets from consuming goods. The marginal utility is the additional satisfaction she gets from consuming one more unit of a good. So, marginal utility per dollar spent is like the satisfaction per dollar.\n\nThe rule for utility maximization is that the marginal utility per dollar should be equal for all goods that are being consumed. That means for apples and oranges, the utility she gets per dollar spent should be the same.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nMU_apples / P_apples = MU_oranges / P_oranges\n\nWhere MU is marginal utility and P is price.\n\nGiven that P_apples = $1 and P_oranges = $2, and MU_apples = 12 and MU_oranges = 18, let's plug in the values:\n\n12 / 1 = 18 / 2\n\n12 = 9?\n\nWait, that's not right. 18 divided by 2 is 9, so 12 does not equal 9. So, her current consumption is not optimal because the marginal utility per dollar is not the same for both goods.\n\nSo, she needs to adjust her consumption to make sure that the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both apples and oranges.\n\nNow, the question is whether she should buy more apples or more oranges.\n\nLet's see: MU_apples / P_apples = 12 / 1 = 12 utils per dollar.\n\nMU_oranges / P_oranges = 18 / 2 = 9 utils per dollar.\n\nSince 12 > 9, she's getting more utility per dollar from apples than from oranges. So, she should buy more apples and fewer oranges to equalize the marginal utility per dollar.\n\nWait, but let's think about this. If she buys more apples, the marginal utility of apples will decrease (because typically, as you consume more of something, the additional satisfaction decreases), and if she buys fewer oranges, the marginal utility of oranges will increase.\n\nSo, by buying more apples, MU_apples will decrease, and by buying fewer oranges, MU_oranges will increase. This should help in making MU_apples / P_apples equal to MU_oranges / P_oranges.\n\nAlternatively, if she buys more oranges, MU_oranges would decrease, and buying fewer apples would increase MU_apples, which would make the ratio closer to each other.\n\nBut in this case, since MU_apples / P_apples is higher than MU_oranges / P_oranges, she should move towards consuming more apples and fewer oranges.\n\nLet me consider the options:\n\nA. She should make no changes; she is consuming the utility maximizing combination of apples and oranges.\n\nThis is incorrect because, as we saw, MU_apples / P_apples \u2260 MU_oranges / P_oranges.\n\nB. She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.\n\nThis seems right, based on my earlier thinking.\n\nC. She should decrease her apple consumption and increase her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.\n\nThis suggests the opposite of option B.\n\nD. She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility is equal for both.\n\nWait, this is similar to option B, but it says \"marginal utility is equal for both,\" not \"marginal utility per dollar.\"\n\nBut in utility maximization, it's the marginal utility per dollar that should be equal, not just the marginal utility.\n\nSo, option D is incorrect because it's not about equalizing just the marginal utilities, but the utilities per dollar spent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: she should adjust her consumption to equalize the marginal utility per dollar for both goods.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nSuppose she buys more apples; MU_apples decreases, and since P_apples is $1, MU_apples / 1 decreases.\n\nMeanwhile, if she buys fewer oranges, MU_oranges increases, and MU_oranges / 2 increases.\n\nSo, by buying more apples and fewer oranges, she can make MU_apples / 1 closer to MU_oranges / 2.\n\nAlternatively, if she buys more oranges and fewer apples, MU_apples would increase (if she buys fewer apples), and MU_oranges would decrease (if she buys more oranges).\n\nSo, MU_apples / 1 would increase, and MU_oranges / 2 would decrease, which might make the ratios more unequal.\n\nTherefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption B is the correct choice.\n\nWait, but option D says to increase apple consumption and decrease orange consumption until marginal utility is equal for both.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, it's the marginal utility per dollar that should be equal, not just the marginal utilities.\n\nSo, even if MU_apples equals MU_oranges, if the prices are different, the utilities per dollar would still be unequal.\n\nFor example, if MU_apples = MU_oranges = 15, but P_apples = $1 and P_oranges = $2, then MU_apples / 1 = 15, and MU_oranges / 2 = 7.5, which are not equal.\n\nSo, option D is incorrect because it's focusing on the wrong thing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: she should adjust her consumption to equalize the marginal utility per dollar for both goods.\n\nI think that's the right approach.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
