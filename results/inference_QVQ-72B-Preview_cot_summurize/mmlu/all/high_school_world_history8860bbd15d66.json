Isn't negotiation a better path?\" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word \"tension.\" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.\"\nMartin Luther King, Jr., Letter from a Birmingham Jail, 1966\nSource 2:\n\"We, men and women, who hereby constitute ourselves as the National Organization for Women, believe that the time has come for a new movement toward true equality for all women in America, and toward a fully equal partnership of the sexes, as part of the world-wide revolution of human rights now taking place within and beyond our national borders.\nThe purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.\nWe believe the time has come to move beyond the abstract argument, discussion and symposia over the status and special nature of women which has raged in America in recent years; the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of which is their right, as individual Americans, and as human beings.\"\nNational Organization for Women, Statement of Purpose, 1966\nSource 3:\n\"The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression. This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.\nAs we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women's liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women's liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation. In order to build this alliance, the brothers in gay liberation will have to be prepared to sacrifice that degree of male chauvinism and male privilege that they still all possess.\"\nGay Liberation Front, Manifesto, 1971\nThe author of Source 1 endorses which of the following tactics as a means of achieving his aims?\n\nA. Violent overthrow of the government\nB. Nonviolent resistance\nC. Appeasement\nD. Legal action\n"

                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about Source 1, which is from Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail.\" The question is asking what tactic King endorses to achieve his aims. The options are:\n\nA. Violent overthrow of the government\n\nB. Nonviolent resistance\n\nC. Appeasement\n\nD. Legal action\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what King was saying in this letter. I remember that he was responding to criticism from white clergymen about his methods of protest, particularly the civil rights demonstrations in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nLet me think about the key points in the letter. King talks about the importance of direct action, like sit-ins and marches, and he explains why negotiation alone isn't sufficient. He mentions that nonviolent direct action is meant to create a crisis and tension that forces the community to address the issue of racial injustice.\n\nHe also makes a point about different types of tension. He's not afraid of tension per se, but he distinguishes between violent tension, which he opposes, and constructive, nonviolent tension that can lead to growth and positive change.\n\nSo, based on this, it's pretty clear that King is advocating for nonviolent resistance as a tactic to achieve civil rights and equality.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider each option:\n\nA. Violent overthrow of the government: King was known for his commitment to nonviolence, so this doesn't align with his philosophy.\n\nB. Nonviolent resistance: This seems spot on based on the excerpt. He explicitly mentions nonviolent direct action and constructive, nonviolent tension.\n\nC. Appeasement: This is usually associated with giving in to demands to maintain peace, often at the cost of principles. King was anything but an appeaser; he stood firm in his principles and actively confronted injustice.\n\nD. Legal action: While King was involved in legal challenges through organizations like the NAACP, the focus of this particular source is on direct action and nonviolent protest, not specifically legal proceedings.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is B. Nonviolent resistance.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll look back at the source text. He says, \"Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue.\" And he also states, \"I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth.\"\n\nSo, yeah, it's clear that King is endorsing nonviolent resistance as the means to achieve his aims.\n\nI think I'm confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
