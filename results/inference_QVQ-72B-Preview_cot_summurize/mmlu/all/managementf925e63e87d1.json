Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a functional structure is. From what I remember in my management class, a functional structure is when an organization is divided into departments based on specific functions or areas of expertise. Like, you might have a marketing department, a finance department, a production department, and so on. Each department focuses on its particular area of specialization.\n\nSo, if functional structures are about dividing the organization into specialized departments, then it seems like they help to create specialization. That would make option B. specialisation the correct answer.\n\nBut let me think about this more carefully. Maybe it could also promote teamwork within departments, since people in the same department would be working together towards common goals. So, option A. teamwork could be a possibility. But is that the primary benefit of a functional structure?\n\nOption C. project work groups sounds interesting. Sometimes, in functional structures, project teams are formed by bringing together people from different departments. But that seems more related to matrix structures rather than purely functional structures. So, maybe not the main thing created by functional structures.\n\nOption D. multi-skilled employees\u2014well, if each department is specialized, maybe people tend to develop deep expertise in one area rather than multiple skills. So, perhaps this isn't directly promoted by a functional structure.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look back at the definition. Functional structures are based on specialization by function. So, each department is composed of people who are experts in a particular function. This allows for deep expertise and efficiency in that area.\n\nFor example, in a marketing department, everyone might be specialized in marketing techniques, market research, branding, etc. Similarly, in the production department, they focus on manufacturing processes.\n\nSo, in this setup, it seems like specialisation is the key aspect being fostered. Teamwork might be a byproduct within each department, but it's not the primary purpose of the structure.\n\nProject work groups might be formed temporarily by combining people from different departments, but again, that's not the core feature of a functional structure.\n\nAs for multi-skilled employees, if anything, functional structures might lead to narrower skill sets because people are specialized in their function. To develop multiple skills, they might need to move across departments, which isn't common in a strict functional structure.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B. specialisation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to interpret this. Maybe the question is trying to trick me by implying that functional structures only promote specialisation, when in reality they could promote other things as well.\n\nFor instance, in a functional structure, because everyone in a department shares similar skills and knowledge, it might be easier to collaborate and work as a team since they understand each other's work well. So, teamwork could be enhanced within departments.\n\nHowever, between departments, there might be less collaboration, as each department focuses on its own function. So, while teamwork exists within departments, the structure primarily promotes specialisation.\n\nProject work groups are more common in matrix structures, where projects cut across functional lines, and team members from different functions work together on a project. In a pure functional structure, such arrangements might be less common, unless there's a specific need for cross-functional collaboration.\n\nAs for multi-skilled employees, if the structure encourages people to stay within their function and deepen their expertise, they might become more specialized rather than multi-skilled. So, again, specialisation seems to be the primary outcome.\n\nI think I'm reinforcing my initial thought that functional structures help to create specialisation. So, my final answer is B. specialisation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
