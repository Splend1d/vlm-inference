                    "text": "So I have this question about Utilitarianism. I need to pick the correct description from the options provided. Let me read them again to make sure I understand what each option is saying.\n\nOption A says: \"A theory which states that an action is morally incorrect if it promotes the greatest good for the greatest number.\"\n\nOption B: \"A theory which states that an action is morally right if it promotes the greatest good for the decision maker.\"\n\nOption C: \"A theory which states that an action is morally right if it promotes the greatest good for the smallest number.\"\n\nOption D: \"A theory which states that an action is morally right if it promotes the greatest good for the greatest number.\"\n\nAlright, so I know that Utilitarianism is a moral theory that evaluates the morality of an action based on its consequences. Specifically, it's often associated with the idea of \"the greatest good for the greatest number.\" That sounds like Option D.\n\nBut let me think carefully. I remember that classical utilitarianism, as proposed by philosophers like Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, suggests that the best action is the one that maximizes utility, which is usually defined as happiness or pleasure minus pain or suffering, for the greatest number of people.\n\nSo, according to that, Option D seems correct: an action is morally right if it promotes the greatest good for the greatest number.\n\nBut let me check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A says that an action is morally incorrect if it promotes the greatest good for the greatest number. That seems contradictory because Utilitarianism would consider an action morally right if it promotes the greatest good for the greatest number, not incorrect.\n\nOption B says that an action is morally right if it promotes the greatest good for the decision maker. Hmm, that sounds like it's focusing on the decision maker's good rather than the overall good of everyone affected by the action. This seems more like ethical egoism rather than Utilitarianism. Ethical egoism holds that actions are morally right if they serve the individual's own self-interest.\n\nOption C says that an action is morally right if it promotes the greatest good for the smallest number. That seems counterintuitive for Utilitarianism. If you're promoting the good for the smallest number, that would suggest that fewer people are benefiting, which goes against the Utilitarian principle of maximizing good for the greatest number.\n\nSo, based on this, Option D seems to be the correct description of Utilitarianism.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that Utilitarianism could be interpreted differently? For example, there are different types of Utilitarianism, like act-utilitarianism and rule-utilitarianism. Does that affect the answer?\n\nWell, in act-utilitarianism, each specific action is evaluated based on its consequences, aiming for the greatest good for the greatest number. In rule-utilitarianism, actions are evaluated based on whether they conform to rules that, if generally followed, would promote the greatest good for the greatest number.\n\nSo, in both cases, the underlying principle is still about promoting the greatest good for the greatest number of people.\n\nTherefore, Option D remains the correct choice.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any context in which Utilitarianism might prioritize the smallest number or the decision maker. No, I can't think of any. Utilitarianism is fundamentally about maximizing overall happiness or utility across the greatest number of people.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The correct description of Utilitarianism is Option D: \"A theory which states that an action is morally right if it promotes the greatest good for the greatest number.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
