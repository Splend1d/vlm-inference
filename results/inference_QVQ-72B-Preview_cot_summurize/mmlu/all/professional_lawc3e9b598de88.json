The plaintiff was severely injured in the reservoir when he dove from a boat into what he thought was deep water and hit an unmarked submerged island. The plaintiff alleges that the company was negligent in failing to mark the submerged island. At trial, the plaintiff has called an engineer and qualified him as plaintiff has called an engineer and qualified him as an expert in managing reservoirs. Which of the following opinions by the plaintiff's expert is the court most likely to admit?\n\nA. \"The accident probably occurred in the manner shown by this computer-animated film I made.\"\nB. \"The company could have marked the island in a day and at a cost of $300.\"\nC. \"The company was required by federal law to mark the island.\"\nD. \"The plaintiff was not contributorily negligent.\"\n"

                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these expert opinions the court is most likely to admit. The plaintiff has called an engineer who's qualified as an expert in managing reservoirs. Let me think about the rules for admitting expert testimony.\n\nFirst off, for an expert's opinion to be admissible, it needs to be relevant to the case and based on reliable methods or principles. The expert should also have the necessary qualifications to offer the opinion. In this case, the engineer is already qualified as an expert in managing reservoirs, so that part seems covered.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. \"The accident probably occurred in the manner shown by this computer-animated film I made.\"\n\nHmm, this one is about reconstructing the accident using a computer-animated film. While animations can be helpful in showing how an accident might have occurred, their admissibility often depends on whether they accurately represent the events in question. The expert would need to explain the methods and data used to create the animation and show that it's a reliable representation. Courts are generally cautious about admitting animations unless they're properly validated.\n\nB. \"The company could have marked the island in a day and at a cost of $300.\"\n\nThis opinion seems to be about the feasibility and cost of marking the submerged island. Since the engineer is an expert in reservoir management, he likely has knowledge about standard practices in maintaining reservoirs for recreation, including marking hazards. This type of testimony could be relevant to showing whether the utility company met its duty to ensure safety by marking potential dangers. It's straightforward and directly related to the engineer's area of expertise.\n\nC. \"The company was required by federal law to mark the island.\"\n\nThis statement appears to be a legal conclusion. Experts are generally not allowed to offer opinions on pure legal questions, as that's the province of the judge. The court would likely prefer that the expert testify about the standards of practice in reservoir management and let the judge or jury determine whether those standards impose a legal requirement to mark the island.\n\nD. \"The plaintiff was not contributorily negligent.\"\n\nThis seems to be an opinion on the plaintiff's state of mind or behavior at the time of the accident. Unless the engineer has specific expertise in human behavior or accident reconstruction that relates to negligence, this might be outside his area of expertise. Moreover, questions of negligence are typically for the jury to decide, based on the evidence presented.\n\nConsidering all this, option B seems the most straightforward and directly within the expert's field of reservoir management. It addresses a specific aspect of the case\u2014namely, the ease and cost of marking the hazard\u2014which is relevant to the company's alleged negligence in failing to do so.\n\nI think the court is most likely to admit opinion B: \"The company could have marked the island in a day and at a cost of $300.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
