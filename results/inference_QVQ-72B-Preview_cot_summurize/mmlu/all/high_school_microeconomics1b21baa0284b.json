                    "text": "Let's see here. So, the problem says that if the price of Firm A's cell phone service rises by 5 percent, and the quantity demanded for Firm B's cell phone service increases by 10 percent. And we need to choose which statement is correct from the given options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this information is telling me. When the price of one product increases, and the quantity demanded of another product increases, it suggests that the two products are substitutes. That is, if A becomes more expensive, people switch to B, leading to an increase in demand for B.\n\nSo, this sounds like a case of cross-price elasticity of demand. Cross-price elasticity measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of one good to a change in the price of another good.\n\nThe formula for cross-price elasticity (E_{AB}) is:\n\nE_{AB} = (% change in quantity demanded of B) / (% change in price of A)\n\nPlugging in the given numbers:\n\nE_{AB} = (10%) / (5%) = 2\n\nSince E_{AB} is positive (2 > 0), it indicates that Firm A and Firm B are substitutes.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Demand for Firm B is price elastic.\n\nWell, price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in the price of that good. Here, the price of Firm B hasn't changed; it's the price of Firm A that changed. So, this option is talking about the response of Firm B's demand to its own price changes, which isn't what's being discussed here. Hence, this doesn't seem to be the correct choice.\n\nB. Supply for Firm B is price elastic.\n\nSimilarly, supply elasticity measures how much the quantity supplied of a good responds to a change in the price of that good. Again, it's the price of Firm A that changed, not Firm B's price. So, this also doesn't fit the scenario described. Probably not the right answer.\n\nC. Firms A and B are substitutes because the cross-price elasticity is greater than zero.\n\nYes, this matches what I thought earlier. Since E_{AB} is positive, it indicates that Firm A and Firm B are substitutes. The cross-price elasticity being positive means that when the price of A increases, the demand for B increases, which is consistent with substitute goods.\n\nD. Firms A and B are complements because the cross-price elasticity is less than zero.\n\nNo, complements have negative cross-price elasticity. That would mean when the price of A increases, the demand for B decreases, because they are used together. But in this case, the demand for B increased when A's price increased, so the cross-price elasticity is positive, indicating substitutes, not complements.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. If Firm A and Firm B are substitutes, then an increase in A's price should lead to an increase in demand for B, which is what's happening here. For example, if Firm A is Verizon and Firm B is AT&T, and Verizon raises its prices, some customers might switch to AT&T because it's now relatively cheaper or perceived as a substitute.\n\nSo, yes, based on this, option C is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nIs there any chance that the relationship could be interpreted differently, perhaps considering indirect effects or market dynamics?\n\nWell, in basic microeconomics, the direct relationship between the price of one good and the quantity demanded of another good is captured by cross-price elasticity. And as calculated, a positive value indicates substitutes, while a negative value indicates complements.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any information provided that would suggest a different interpretation, such as the goods being inferior or luxury goods, or any specific market conditions that could affect this relationship.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward and accurate conclusion is that Firms A and B are substitutes because the cross-price elasticity is greater than zero.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
