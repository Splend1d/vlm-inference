                    "text": "So I have this question here about social norms. It's asking what social norms are, and it gives four options. Let me read them again to make sure I understand.\n\nOption A says social norms are creative activities such as gardening, cookery, and craftwork.\n\nOption B says they are the symbolic representation of social groups in the mass media.\n\nOption C says they are religious beliefs about how the world ought to be.\n\nAnd option D says they are rules and expectations about interaction that regulate social life.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which one of these correctly defines social norms.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what a social norm is. From my sociology class, I remember that social norms are standards of behavior that are considered acceptable in a particular society or group. They're like unwritten rules that guide how people should act in different situations.\n\nSo, for example, saying \"hello\" when you meet someone or waiting your turn in line are social norms because they're expected behaviors that help society run smoothly.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Creative activities like gardening, cookery, and craftwork. These seem more like hobbies or pastimes rather than rules governing behavior. While they can be social activities, I don't think they directly define what social norms are.\n\nOption B: Symbolic representation of social groups in the mass media. This sounds more related to how groups are portrayed in media, which might influence social norms, but it's not the definition of social norms themselves. Maybe it's related to stereotyping or representation, but not directly to the rules of behavior.\n\nOption C: Religious beliefs about how the world ought to be. This seems close because religion can influence moral and ethical standards, which can shape social norms. However, social norms aren't exclusively religious; they can be secular too and are often based on cultural practices and expectations.\n\nOption D: Rules and expectations about interaction that regulate social life. This sounds very much like the definition of social norms. They are guidelines for social interaction that help maintain order and predictability in society.\n\nLet me double-check. Social norms are indeed the informal understandings that govern the behavior of members of a society. They specify what is acceptable or unacceptable behavior in particular situations.\n\nSo, based on this, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other options could also be considered social norms.\n\nOption A: Creative activities. While these activities can be part of social life and may have their own norms, they aren't the definition of social norms themselves. For example, there might be norms around sharing recipes in cooking circles or norms about collaborating on crafts, but the activities themselves aren't the norms.\n\nOption B: Symbolic representation in media. This is more about how groups are depicted in media, which can influence social perceptions and perhaps norms, but it's not directly the definition of social norms. Social norms are more about the behavioral expectations within a society.\n\nOption C: Religious beliefs. While religion can be a source of social norms, especially moral and ethical ones, social norms are broader and encompass both religious and non-religious expectations. So, again, not the complete definition.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate definition of social norms is option D: rules and expectations about interaction that regulate social life.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll look up a quick definition to confirm.\n\n[Imagining searching for \"social norms definition\"]\n\nOkay, according to standard definitions, social norms are indeed the informal rules that govern the behavior of members of a society. They dictate what is considered acceptable or unacceptable in specific situations.\n\nSo, yes, option D is correct.\n\nI think that's it. I don't need to overcomplicate this. Social norms are basically the unwritten rules that guide how we interact with each other in society.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
