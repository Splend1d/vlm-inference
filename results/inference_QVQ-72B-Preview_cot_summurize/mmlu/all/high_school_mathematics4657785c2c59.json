Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the first part of the expression: \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)^4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot a^4\\).\n\nI know that \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)^4\\) is the same as \\(a^{-4}\\), right? So, \\(a^{-4} \\cdot 2 \\cdot a^4\\). When you multiply exponents with the same base, you add the exponents. So, \\(a^{-4} \\cdot a^4 = a^{0} = 1\\). Then, \\(1 \\cdot 2 = 2\\). So, the first part simplifies to 2.\n\nNext, I need to look at the second part: \\(a^{2+1-3}\\). Let's calculate the exponent first: \\(2 + 1 - 3 = 0\\). So, \\(a^0 = 1\\), for any non-zero \\(a\\).\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to \\(2 + 1 = 3\\).\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting again:\n\n\\(\\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)^4 = a^{-4}\\)\n\nThen, \\(a^{-4} \\cdot a^4 = a^{(-4+4)} = a^0 = 1\\)\n\nMultiplying by 2: \\(2 \\cdot 1 = 2\\)\n\nNow, \\(a^{2+1-3} = a^{0} = 1\\)\n\nSo, adding them up: \\(2 + 1 = 3\\)\n\nSeems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any other interpretations.\n\nIs there any other way to interpret the expression? For example, could the division or multiplication be grouped differently? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)^4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot a^4 + a^{2+1-3}\\)\n\nThe parentheses indicate that it's \\(\\frac{1}{a}\\) raised to the 4th power, not just \\(1\\) over \\(a^4\\). So, it's correctly interpreted as \\(a^{-4}\\), not \\(a^4\\) in the denominator.\n\nAlso, the addition is straightforward, adding the two terms together.\n\nSo, I think my simplification is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 3.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0\n\nB. 1\n\nC. 2\n\nD. 3\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
