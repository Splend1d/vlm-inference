                    "text": "Let's see here. My aunt makes apple pies from home and hires some friends to help. I need to figure out which situation would make her want to hire more people. The options are:\n\nA. The price of apple peelers/corers rises.\n\nB. Your aunt\u2019s friends gossip all day, slowing their dough-making process.\n\nC. There is a sale on ovens.\n\nD. A new study reveals that apples increase your risk of cancer.\n\nOkay, let's think about each one.\n\nOption A: If the price of apple peelers/corers rises, that means the tools needed to prepare the apples are more expensive. If these tools are essential for the pie-making process, higher prices might make it more costly for my aunt to produce the pies. Maybe she would produce fewer pies as a result, which would mean she needs less labor. So, this seems like it might decrease her demand for labor, not increase it.\n\nOption B: Her friends gossip all day and slow down the dough-making process. So, if the people she's already hired are less productive because they're chatting instead of working, she might need to hire more people to make up for the lost time and maintain the same level of output. Alternatively, she might decide to monitor them more closely or find a way to incentivize them to work faster. But if she chooses to hire more people to keep up with demand, this would increase her demand for labor.\n\nOption C: There's a sale on ovens. Ovens are capital equipment for her business. If ovens are on sale, they become cheaper to acquire. Having better or more ovens could make the pie-making process more efficient. Maybe she can bake more pies at once or faster. This increased efficiency could allow her to produce more pies without necessarily hiring more people, or she might be able to produce more with the same number of workers. So, this might not necessarily lead to an increase in labor demand. In fact, if the new ovens are so efficient that they reduce the need for labor, she might hire fewer people.\n\nOption D: A new study reveals that apples increase your risk of cancer. Hmm, this sounds bad for the apple pie business. If apples are linked to cancer, people might be less likely to buy apple pies out of health concerns. Demand for her pies could drop, which would mean she needs to produce fewer pies and thus might need fewer workers. So, this seems like it would decrease her demand for labor.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, option B seems to be the one that would most likely increase her demand for labor. If her current workers are gossiping and slowing down production, she might need to hire more people to maintain her output levels.\n\nWait a minute, but is that necessarily true? Maybe she should address the gossip issue first, like talking to her friends about staying focused during work hours. If she can resolve the productivity issue by managing her current workforce better, she might not need to hire more people. But the question is about what would most likely increase her demand for labor, and assuming that she might choose to hire more people rather than deal with the gossiping, option B still seems plausible.\n\nAnother thought: if her friends are gossiping and slowing down dough-making, perhaps she needs to hire more people specifically for that task to keep up with the pie-making process. For example, if dough preparation is taking longer due to gossiping, she might need additional help in that area to ensure that there's enough dough ready when needed for baking.\n\nAlternatively, she might consider cross-training her existing staff to handle other tasks or implementing stricter work rules to improve productivity. But again, the question is about which situation would most likely increase her demand for labor, not about the best management practice.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other option that could lead to an increase in labor demand.\n\nOption A: Rise in the price of apple peelers/corers. This would increase production costs, possibly leading to higher pie prices and potentially lower sales. Lower sales would mean less production and thus less labor needed, so this doesn't seem likely to increase labor demand.\n\nOption C: Sale on ovens. This could lead to improved efficiency, which might allow her to produce more pies without increasing labor or even with less labor if the new ovens automate some processes. So, this doesn't seem like it would necessarily increase labor demand.\n\nOption D: Apples linked to cancer. This would likely decrease demand for apple pies, leading to less production and thus less labor needed.\n\nSo, by elimination, option B seems to be the best answer. But just to be sure, let's think about it differently.\n\nSuppose my aunt's production process is such that dough-making is a bottleneck. If her friends are gossiping and slowing down dough-making, that bottleneck is getting tighter, potentially limiting the overall production. To overcome this, she might indeed hire more people to work on dough-making, thereby increasing her labor demand.\n\nAlternatively, she could rearrange tasks, have other workers help with dough-making, or invest in machinery that makes dough faster. But again, the question is about what would most likely happen, and hiring more labor is a straightforward response to decreased productivity in a critical task.\n\nI think I've convinced myself that option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
