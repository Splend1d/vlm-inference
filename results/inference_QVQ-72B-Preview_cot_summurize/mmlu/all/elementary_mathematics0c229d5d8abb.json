                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: find the number that makes the statement 2 over 9 equals 14 over something true. The options are 14, 16, 15, or 63. Hmm, this looks like a proportion problem. I need to find the value that makes 2/9 = 14/? true.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a proportion is. A proportion is an equation that says two ratios are equal. So, in this case, the ratio of 2 to 9 should be equal to the ratio of 14 to some number, which we'll call X.\n\nSo, I can write it as:\n\n2 / 9 = 14 / X\n\nNow, to solve for X, I can cross-multiply. Cross-multiplying means multiplying the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of the other and setting it equal to the product of the other numerator and denominator.\n\nSo, 2 * X = 9 * 14\n\nThat gives me:\n\n2X = 126\n\nNow, to find X, I need to divide both sides of the equation by 2.\n\nX = 126 / 2\n\nX = 63\n\nSo, the number that makes the statement true is 63.\n\nLet me just double-check that. If X is 63, then we have 2/9 = 14/63.\n\nI know that 14 divided by 63 is the same as 2 divided by 9, because 14 is 7 times 2, and 63 is 7 times 9. So, yes, it makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about simplifying 14/63.\n\n14 divided by 7 is 2, and 63 divided by 7 is 9, so 14/63 reduces to 2/9. So, again, that confirms that X should be 63.\n\nI don't think it's 14, because if X is 14, then 2/9 = 14/14, which simplifies to 2/9 = 1, which is not true.\n\nSimilarly, if X is 16, then 2/9 = 14/16. Let's see, 14/16 is 7/8 when simplified, which is not equal to 2/9.\n\nIf X is 15, then 2/9 = 14/15. That doesn't seem right either, because 14/15 is almost 1, and 2/9 is much smaller.\n\nSo, yeah, the only option that makes sense is 63.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's plug in each option:\n\nA. 14\n\n2/9 = 14/14 \u2192 2/9 = 1, which is false.\n\nB. 16\n\n2/9 = 14/16 \u2192 2/9 = 7/8, which is false.\n\nC. 15\n\n2/9 = 14/15 \u2192 approximately 0.222 = 0.933, which is false.\n\nD. 63\n\n2/9 = 14/63 \u2192 2/9 = 2/9, which is true.\n\nSo, clearly, the correct answer is 63.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{63} \\]"
