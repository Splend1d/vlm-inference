                    "text": "Alright, let's dive into this contract law problem. It seems a bit tricky at first glance, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, we have a buyer and a seller. The buyer sends a signed letter to the seller saying, \"Ship 100 boxes of nails at $3 per box, the price quoted in your circular.\" This sounds like an offer from the buyer to the seller, right? The buyer is proposing to buy something at a specific price.\n\nThen, the seller responds with a signed form acknowledgment that agrees to the buyer's terms but also adds a condition: \"Disputes regarding quality shall be arbitrated.\" This is interesting because the seller is not only accepting the buyer's offer but also adding an additional term about arbitration.\n\nNow, the buyer doesn't reply to the seller's acknowledgment, and the seller goes ahead and ships the nails. Later, the buyer receives the nails but finds their quality unsatisfactory and decides to sue the seller for breach of warranty. The seller, in turn, wonders if the contract requires arbitration of this claim.\n\nThe question is asking for the best advice an attorney can provide to the seller regarding whether arbitration is required in this scenario.\n\nLet me think about this. First, I need to understand the formation of the contract between the buyer and the seller.\n\nThe buyer made an offer to buy 100 boxes of nails at $3 per box. The seller responded with an acknowledgment that agreed to these terms but also included an additional term about arbitration. Now, generally, if someone responds to an offer by adding or changing terms, that response is considered a counteroffer, not an acceptance. So, in this case, the seller's acknowledgment would be a counteroffer that includes the arbitration clause.\n\nSince the buyer didn't reply to the seller's acknowledgment, there was no express acceptance of this counteroffer. However, the seller went ahead and shipped the nails, and the buyer accepted the delivery.\n\nIn contract law, acceptance can sometimes be implied by conduct. For example, if one party ships the goods and the other party accepts them, that acceptance of the goods might be considered as acceptance of the terms under which the goods were offered.\n\nBut here's the catch: the arbitration clause was on the reverse side of the seller's acknowledgment. Did the buyer have actual knowledge of this clause? Did they have a reasonable opportunity to know about it?\n\nThis brings up issues related to the \"battle of the forms\" in contract law, particularly in transactions governed by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which deals with sales of goods.\n\nUnder the UCC, when both parties are merchants, if their written confirmations contain additional or different terms, those terms can become part of the contract under certain conditions.\n\nSpecifically, Section 2-207 of the UCC provides that:\n\n1. Additional terms are proposed conditions, and object to them unless the other party agrees.\n\n2. Additional terms are accepted if they are consistent with the usage of trade or are otherwise becoming part of the contract if the party receiving the confirmation doesn't object in writing within a reasonable time.\n\n3. Additional terms that materially alter the contract are not part of the contract unless expressly agreed to.\n\nIn this case, the arbitration clause is an additional term to the original offer. It's important to determine whether this term materially alters the contract.\n\nMaterial alteration typically involves terms that would significantly change the obligations or rights of the parties. Arbitration clauses can be considered material alterations because they change the dispute resolution mechanism from going to court to going through arbitration, which is a significant change in the way disputes are handled.\n\nSo, if the arbitration clause is considered a material alteration, it wouldn't automatically become part of the contract unless the buyer expressly agreed to it.\n\nIn this scenario, the buyer didn't reply to the seller's acknowledgment, so there's no express agreement to the arbitration clause.\n\nHowever, the seller shipped the goods, and the buyer accepted them without objecting to the arbitration clause. This could imply that the buyer accepted the terms of the acknowledgment, including the arbitration clause.\n\nBut, on the other hand, the buyer might argue that they didn't have actual knowledge of the arbitration clause, especially if it was on the reverse side of the acknowledgment and not explicitly brought to their attention.\n\nCourts often look at whether the party had a reasonable opportunity to know about the additional terms. If the acknowledgment was signed by the seller and sent to the buyer, and the buyer didn't respond, it might be argued that the buyer had a chance to see the arbitration clause and choose to proceed anyway.\n\nMoreover, in some jurisdictions, if a party accepts goods without objecting to additional terms, those terms can become part of the contract.\n\nGiven that, it seems that the arbitration clause could be part of the contract between the buyer and the seller.\n\nBut let's look at the options provided:\n\nA. A contract was formed pursuant to conduct when the buyer received the nails, and a court would exclude the arbitration provision from the contract.\n\nB. A contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the arbitration term became part of the contract.\n\nC. A contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the court must decide whether the arbitration term should be excluded as a material alteration of the contract.\n\nD. No contract exists, because the arbitration term in the seller's acknowledgment created a counteroffer that the buyer never accepted.\n\nOption A suggests that the contract was formed by conduct when the buyer received the nails, but that the court would exclude the arbitration provision. However, based on the UCC provisions, if the buyer accepted the goods without objecting to the additional terms, those terms might become part of the contract.\n\nOption B claims that the contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the arbitration term became part of the contract. While it's true that the acknowledgment was sent, and it included the arbitration clause, the buyer didn't expressly accept this counteroffer. The contract is more likely formed when the buyer accepts the goods, assuming that acceptance includes acceptance of the terms in the acknowledgment.\n\nOption C states that the contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the court must decide whether the arbitration term should be excluded as a material alteration of the contract. This seems plausible because arbitration clauses can be considered material alterations, and the court may need to determine whether the buyer had sufficient notice and agreed to this term.\n\nOption D argues that no contract exists because the arbitration term created a counteroffer that the buyer never accepted. However, in practice, when one party ships goods and the other accepts them, a contract is often formed based on the terms of the shipment, including any additional terms in the acknowledgment.\n\nGiven this analysis, I think option C is the most accurate. The contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and now the court must decide whether the arbitration term should be excluded as a material alteration of the contract.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. If the buyer accepted the goods without objecting to the arbitration clause, might the court still exclude it as a material alteration?\n\nIn many cases, courts do consider arbitration clauses to be material alterations, and they may not enforce them if the party didn't have reasonable notice or an opportunity to opt out.\n\nHowever, if the buyer had a reasonable opportunity to know about the arbitration clause and chose to proceed without objecting, the court might enforce it.\n\nStill, given that the buyer didn't reply to the acknowledgment, it's possible that they didn't have actual knowledge of the arbitration clause, especially if it was on the reverse side of the document.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that the court would need to decide whether the arbitration term should be excluded as a material alteration.\n\nSo, I think the best advice the attorney can provide is that a contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the court must decide whether the arbitration term should be excluded as a material alteration of the contract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
