Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that a standard piano typically has 88 keys. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe I should think about different types of pianos and see if any of them have a different number of keys.\n\nI recall that most grand pianos and upright pianos commonly used in homes and studios have 88 keys. This seems to be the standard for full-sized pianos. But what about smaller pianos or digital pianos? Do they sometimes have fewer keys?\n\nLet me consider that. I've seen smaller keyboards and digital pianos that have fewer keys, like 61 or even 49 keys. But those are usually considered to be keyboards or digital pianos, not full-sized acoustic pianos. So, for the term \"standard piano,\" I think 88 keys is the norm.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I'll consider the history a bit. In the past, some pianos had different numbers of keys. For example, earlier pianos might have had as few as 49 keys, while some modern concert grand pianos have up to 97 keys. However, the vast majority of pianos manufactured since the mid-19th century have 88 keys.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the range of notes. The 88 keys on a standard piano cover seven octaves and a minor second, from the lowest note A at 27.5 Hz to the highest note C at 4186.01 Hz. This wide range allows for a great variety of music to be played.\n\nAlso, I remember that some digital pianos and synthesizers may have additional keys beyond the traditional 88 to expand the musical range or for specific purposes, but again, these are not considered standard pianos.\n\nSo, based on my knowledge, the correct answer should be C. 88.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check this. Perhaps there's a trick here. Is there a possibility that \"standard piano\" could refer to something else?\n\nLet me think about the context. The question specifies \"a standard piano,\" which likely refers to a full-sized acoustic piano used in most professional and educational settings. In that case, 88 keys is indeed the standard.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I can look up some quick references. For instance, I know that Yamaha and Steinway & Sons, two prominent piano manufacturers, produce pianos with 88 keys as their standard models.\n\nAdditionally, considering that the other options provided are 20, 54, and 100, I can't recall any standard pianos having such key counts. Twenty keys seem far too few, even for the smallest keyboards, and 100 keys would be unusually high for a standard piano.\n\nFifty-four keys, on the other hand, might be found in some smaller or toy pianos, but again, these are not considered standard instruments. In fact, I think I've seen small children's pianos with around 30 keys, but that's beside the point.\n\nTherefore, after considering all this, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. 88.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
