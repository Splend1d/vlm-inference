                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about rotational correlation times for molecules in a liquid. It mentions the Stokes equation for a spherical object's rotational correlation time, which is \u03c4c = 4\u03c0\u03b7r\u00b3 / 3kBT. But in this problem, they're saying that for a small molecule with a relative molecular mass Mr = 100 in water at 298 K, \u03c4c = 50 ps, and they want me to estimate \u03c4c for a small protein with Mr = 8400, assuming Mr is proportional to the molecular volume.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. Rotational correlation time is a measure of how long it takes for a molecule to rotate by a certain angle due to thermal fluctuations in a liquid. It's important in understanding the dynamics of molecules in solution, like proteins in water.\n\nThe Stokes equation relates this time to the viscosity of the liquid (\u03b7), the radius of the molecule (r), and the temperature (T), via the Boltzmann constant (kB). But here, they're giving me \u03c4c for one molecule and asking for \u03c4c for another based on their molecular masses.\n\nThey assume that Mr is proportional to the molecular volume. That makes sense because for spherical molecules, volume is proportional to r\u00b3, and Mr is proportional to volume, so Mr should be proportional to r\u00b3.\n\nGiven that, if I can find the ratio of the radii cubed, I can find the ratio of their \u03c4c values, since \u03c4c is proportional to r\u00b3.\n\nSo, let's denote the two molecules:\n\nMolecule 1: Mr1 = 100, \u03c4c1 = 50 ps\n\nMolecule 2: Mr2 = 8400, \u03c4c2 = ?\n\nSince Mr is proportional to r\u00b3, we can write:\n\nMr \u221d r\u00b3\n\nTherefore, r \u221d Mr^(1/3)\n\nNow, from the Stokes equation, \u03c4c \u221d r\u00b3, because \u03c4c = 4\u03c0\u03b7r\u00b3 / 3kBT, and \u03b7, T, kB are constants in this context.\n\nTherefore, \u03c4c \u221d r\u00b3 \u221d Mr\n\nWait, no. \u03c4c \u221d r\u00b3, and r \u221d Mr^(1/3), so \u03c4c \u221d (Mr^(1/3))\u00b3 = Mr\n\nBut that seems off because if \u03c4c \u221d r\u00b3 and r \u221d Mr^(1/3), then \u03c4c \u221d Mr, but according to the Stokes equation, \u03c4c = 4\u03c0\u03b7r\u00b3 / 3kBT, and since r \u221d Mr^(1/3), then \u03c4c \u221d Mr.\n\nBut wait, in the problem, they give \u03c4c for Mr = 100 as 50 ps, and ask for \u03c4c for Mr = 8400.\n\nSo, if \u03c4c \u221d Mr, then \u03c4c2 / \u03c4c1 = Mr2 / Mr1\n\nTherefore, \u03c4c2 = \u03c4c1 * (Mr2 / Mr1) = 50 ps * (8400 / 100) = 50 ps * 84 = 4200 ps = 4.2 ns\n\nBut that's option C, 4.2 ns.\n\nBut wait, is this correct? I need to make sure that my proportionality is right.\n\nGiven that \u03c4c \u221d r\u00b3 and r \u221d Mr^(1/3), then \u03c4c \u221d Mr^(1/3)^3 = Mr, so yes, \u03c4c \u221d Mr.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of \u03c4c should be equal to the ratio of their molecular masses.\n\nSo, \u03c4c2 = \u03c4c1 * (Mr2 / Mr1) = 50 ps * 84 = 4200 ps = 4.2 ns.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 4.2 ns.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nThe problem says \"assuming that Mr is proportional to the molecular volume.\" For spheres, volume is proportional to r\u00b3, so Mr \u221d r\u00b3, which implies r \u221d Mr^(1/3), and \u03c4c \u221d r\u00b3 \u221d Mr, so yes, \u03c4c should scale linearly with Mr under this assumption.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to be more precise, I could use the actual formula and calculate r from Mr, assuming a known density or something, but since they're proportional, the proportionality constants should cancel out.\n\nTherefore, I think the simplest and most accurate answer is C. 4.2 ns.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{C}\\]"
