                    "text": "So I've got this question here about a technique called \"eyeballing.\" It's not something I've heard of before, but the options seem to be related to different contexts where you might use the term \"eyeballing.\" Let me see if I can figure out which one is correct.\n\nOption A says it's about reading a textual document quickly to understand the gist of it. Hmm, that sounds more like skimming or scanning. I think skimming is when you read quickly to get the main idea, often skipping less important details. Scanning is similar but usually more focused on finding specific information. Eyeballing might be related, but I'm not sure if it's exactly the same as skimming or scanning.\n\nOption B suggests gathering a sample from whoever you can see in a public place. That sounds like convenience sampling, where you just pick people who are convenient to reach, like passersby. But \"eyeballing\" in this context seems a bit vague. Maybe it's about selecting people based on appearance or some visual cue, but that seems a bit superficial for research purposes.\n\nOption C mentions scanning a table to identify general patterns and significant figures. This seems plausible. In statistics or data analysis, eyeballing could refer to quickly looking at data to get a sense of its distribution, identify outliers, or see trends without doing detailed calculations. That aligns with what I think of as visual inspection of data.\n\nOption D says keeping your eyes on research participants at all times. That sounds more like surveillance or close observation, perhaps in an experimental setting where you need to monitor participants continuously. While observation is a part of research, calling it \"eyeballing\" seems informal and not standard practice.\n\nConsidering these options, I think Option C is the most accurate description of \"eyeballing.\" It involves looking at data quickly to understand its general characteristics and pick out important numbers or patterns. This is a common practice in data analysis, where researchers might look at a table of statistics to get a quick sense of the data before performing more in-depth analyses.\n\nI should also consider if \"eyeballing\" could apply to other contexts. For example, in survey research, eyeballing might refer to quickly assessing response rates or the demographics of respondents. In experimental research, it could involve observing the behavior of participants at a glance. However, these seem more specific than the general definition in Option C.\n\nLet me check if there's any formal definition or common usage that supports this. A quick search reveals that \"eyeballing\" is indeed a term used in data analysis and statistics to refer to the practice of making judgments or estimates based on visual inspection rather than precise measurements. So, it aligns well with Option C: scanning a table to identify general patterns and significant figures.\n\nIn summary, based on my understanding and the research I've done, \"eyeballing\" is best described as scanning a table to identify general patterns and significant figures. Therefore, the correct answer is Option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
