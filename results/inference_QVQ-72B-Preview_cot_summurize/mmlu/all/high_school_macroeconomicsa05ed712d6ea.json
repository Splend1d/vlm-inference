                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about monetarist theory. I have four options here, and I need to pick the one that aligns with monetarist thought. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that the Fed should actively conduct monetary policy. Now, from what I remember about monetarism, especially with economists like Milton Friedman, they believed in a steady, predictable growth in the money supply. They didn't necessarily advocate for active, discretionary monetary policy actions by the Fed. In fact, Friedman was famous for saying something like \"the business of central banking is to be dull\" meaning that sudden changes in policy can be disruptive. So, maybe this isn't the best fit for monetarist theory.\n\nOption B states that changes in the money supply do not have significant effects. This seems contrary to what monetarists believe. Monetarists are known for emphasizing the importance of the money supply in influencing economic activity and inflation. They believe that changes in the money supply do affect the economy, particularly in the long run. So, this option doesn't seem right either.\n\nOption C suggests that fiscal policy is the preferred way of shifting the aggregate demand curve. Monetarists are actually more inclined towards using monetary policy rather than fiscal policy to manage the economy. They believe that changes in the money supply are more effective and reliable in influencing aggregate demand compared to fiscal policy tools like government spending and taxation. So, this option doesn't align with monetarist views.\n\nThat leaves Option D: the Fed should allow the money supply to grow at a constant rate. This sounds familiar. I think Milton Friedman advocated for a \"steady as she goes\" approach to monetary policy, where the money supply should grow at a consistent, pre-determined rate, preferably linked to the long-term growth rate of the economy. This was seen as a way to avoid boom-and-bust cycles caused by unpredictable changes in monetary policy.\n\nLet me double-check this. Monetarists emphasize the stability of the money supply and its relationship with inflation and economic growth. They argue that unexpected changes in the money supply can lead to inflationary pressures or recessions. Therefore, a predictable, steady growth rate in the money supply would help maintain price stability and promote economic growth.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, Option D seems to be the most accurate representation of monetarist theory. The Fed should allow the money supply to grow at a constant rate, providing a stable foundation for economic activity without causing sudden shocks that could disrupt the economy.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
