                    "text": " So I'm trying to figure out which of these options isn't a prima facie duty that Ross discusses. The options are:\n\nA. the duty to keep promises\n\nB. the duty not to harm others\n\nC. the duty to protect our natural environment\n\nD. the duty of nonmaleficence\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a prima facie duty is. From what I recall, prima facie duties are duties that appear to be obligatory at first glance, but which might be overridden by more important duties in certain situations. Ross was an ethical theorist who proposed that there are multiple prima facie duties that guide our moral decisions.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: the duty to keep promises.\n\nI remember that in many ethical theories, keeping promises is considered very important. It's about being trustworthy and reliable. Ross likely includes this as a prima facie duty because promising something creates an obligation that we should honor, unless there's a stronger duty that conflicts with it.\n\nOption B: the duty not to harm others.\n\nThis seems like a fundamental moral principle. Harm can be physical, emotional, or psychological. Not harming others is generally seen as a basic duty. Ross would probably include this as a prima facie duty because causing harm is often wrong, but there might be exceptions where harming someone is necessary to prevent greater harm.\n\nOption C: the duty to protect our natural environment.\n\nThis one feels a bit more modern. Environmental ethics have become more prominent in recent decades due to concerns about climate change and sustainability. While Ross did touch on some aspects of duty regarding nature, I'm not sure if he specifically listed protecting the natural environment as a prima facie duty. His main focus was more on duties towards other people rather than directly towards the environment.\n\nOption D: the duty of nonmaleficence.\n\nThis sounds similar to option B, the duty not to harm others. Nonmaleficence is a principle in ethics and medical ethics that means \"first, do no harm.\" It's about avoiding actions that cause harm or worsen a situation. Ross would likely consider this a prima facie duty, as it's closely related to not harming others.\n\nSo, comparing these options, I need to see which one doesn't fit into Ross's list of prima facie duties.\n\nLet me think about Ross's actual list. From what I can recall, Ross proposed several prima facie duties, including:\n\n- Fidelity (keeping promises)\n\n- Reparation (making amends for wrongs we've done)\n\n- Gratitude (being thankful and reciprocating kindness)\n\n- Justice (treating people fairly)\n\n- Beneficence (promoting the good of others)\n\n- Nonmaleficence (avoiding harm to others)\n\n- Self-improvement (developing one's own character and abilities)\n\nLooking at this list, I see that options A, B, and D are all included:\n\n- A corresponds to fidelity\n\n- B corresponds to nonmaleficence\n\n- D is nonmaleficence\n\nC, the duty to protect our natural environment, isn't directly listed by Ross. While he might have had some thoughts on our duties regarding nature, it's not one of his primary prima facie duties.\n\nAdditionally, considering the time when Ross was writing (early 20th century), environmental concerns weren't as prominent as they are today. So, it's unlikely that he would have included protecting the natural environment as a separate prima facie duty.\n\nTherefore, I would say that option C is not a prima facie duty that Ross discusses.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any possibility that Ross did consider environmental protection as a duty.\n\nLooking back at his list, none of the duties explicitly mention the environment. Fidelity is about keeping promises, reparation is about making amends for wrongs, gratitude is about reciprocating kindness, justice is about fairness, beneficence is about promoting the good of others, nonmaleficence is about avoiding harm to others, and self-improvement is about personal development.\n\nWhile some of these duties could be extended to include aspects of environmental protection (for example, beneficence towards future generations who will be affected by environmental degradation), Ross himself didn't frame them in that way.\n\nMoreover, in his work \"The Right and the Good,\" Ross discusses various moral obligations but doesn't specifically mention duties to the environment or non-human entities.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, I conclude that \"the duty to protect our natural environment\" is not a prima facie duty that Ross discusses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
