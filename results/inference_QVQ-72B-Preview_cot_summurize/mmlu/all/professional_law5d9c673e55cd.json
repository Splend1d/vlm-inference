                    "text": "So I've got this property law scenario here, and I need to figure out what's going to happen based on the facts provided. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a woman who owns a farm. She gives her neighbor, who owns the land next door, an easement of way. That means the neighbor has the right to cross her farm to get to his own property, right? So, it's like a pathway or a right of way across her land.\n\nThen, the woman decides to move to Japan and live there. During her absence, the neighbor moves into her farm and starts using it openly and exclusively. He even pays the taxes on the farm for 23 years. But interestingly, he doesn't use the easement during that time. So, he's living on the farm but not using the right of way that was granted to him.\n\nAfter 23 years, the woman comes back and wants to evict the neighbor from her farm. But the court rules that the neighbor has acquired the farm through adverse possession. So, even though he didn't use the easement, by living on the farm, paying taxes, and being open about his use for over 20 years, he's effectively become the owner of the farm through adverse possession.\n\nNow, the neighbor sells the farm back to the original owner, the woman. After buying it back, she puts a chain across the easement, blocking the neighbor's access. The neighbor then brings a lawsuit to have the chain removed.\n\nThe question is, in most jurisdictions, what will happen? Will the neighbor win or lose, and why?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Lose, because he abandoned his easement.\n\nB. Lose, because he didn't use his easement for the statutory period of 20 years.\n\nC. Lose, because instead of using his easement, he used all of the farm.\n\nD. Win, because mere non-use of an easement doesn't extinguish it.\n\nOkay, so I need to understand which of these is correct.\n\nFirst, let's clarify what an easement is. An easement is a non-possessory interest in another person's land, giving the holder the right to use that land for a specific purpose. In this case, it's an easement of way, which allows the neighbor to cross the farm to access his own property.\n\nNow, the woman granted this easement to the neighbor before she went to Japan. Then, through adverse possession, the neighbor acquired title to the farm. But then he sold the farm back to the woman.\n\nSo, after the sale, the neighbor is no longer the owner of the farm but still has an easement over it, assuming the easement was appurtenant to his land and passed with it.\n\nBut wait, the neighbor still owns the adjacent tract, right? So, the easement of way would typically be appurtenant to his land, allowing him to cross the farm to access his own property.\n\nNow, the woman has bought back the farm from the neighbor, and she's blocked the easement with a chain. The neighbor is suing to have the chain removed.\n\nThe key here is to determine whether the easement still exists after all these transactions.\n\nFirst, when the woman originally granted the easement to the neighbor, it was likely appurtenant to his land, meaning it would benefit his property and pass with it if he sold his land.\n\nThen, the neighbor acquired the farm through adverse possession, but he sold it back to the woman.\n\nSo, after the sale, does the neighbor still have an easement over the farm to access his adjacent tract?\n\nGenerally, easements appurtenant to land continue to exist as long as the dominant and servient tenements are owned by different people, and the easement continues to benefit the dominant tenement.\n\nIn this case, the neighbor still owns the adjacent tract, and the easement over the farm benefits his land by providing access.\n\nTherefore, even after selling the farm back to the woman, the neighbor should still have the easement of way over the farm to access his own property.\n\nNow, the woman has blocked the easement with a chain, which is interfering with the neighbor's right to use the easement.\n\nSo, the neighbor is bringing an action to remove the chain, essentially seeking an injunction or some remedy to restore his right to use the easement.\n\nThe question is, will he succeed in most jurisdictions?\n\nOption D says he will win because mere non-use of an easement doesn't extinguish it.\n\nThat sounds plausible. Generally, non-use alone is not sufficient to extinguish an easement. There needs to be some clear intention to abandon it or some other legal basis for termination.\n\nIn this scenario, the neighbor didn't use the easement for 23 years while he was occupying the farm through adverse possession. But during that time, he was the owner of the farm and didn't need to use the easement to access his own property since he was already on the farm.\n\nAfter selling the farm back to the woman, he would need to use the easement to access his adjacent tract again.\n\nSo, his non-use during the period he owned the farm doesn't necessarily indicate abandonment of the easement, especially since he intended to use it again once he no longer owned the farm.\n\nTherefore, the woman blocking the easement with a chain is interfering with the neighbor's right to use the easement, which is still valid and enforceable.\n\nSo, in most jurisdictions, the neighbor should win this case and have the chain removed.\n\nBut let's look at the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A says he loses because he abandoned the easement.\n\nAbandonment requires clear intention to give up the easement. In this case, while he didn't use the easement for 23 years, it was because he was living on the farm and didn't need to use it. When he sold the farm back to the woman, he would need to use the easement again to access his own property. So, there's no clear intention to abandon it permanently.\n\nOption B says he loses because he didn't use the easement for the statutory period of 20 years.\n\nWhile it's true that he didn't use the easement for 23 years, generally, non-use alone isn't sufficient to extinguish an easement. There might be specific statutes in some jurisdictions that allow for extinguishment after a certain period of non-use, but I think this is the exception rather than the rule.\n\nMoreover, the statutory period for adverse possession is typically around 20 years in many jurisdictions, but again, adverse possession is about acquiring rights, not extinguishing existing ones.\n\nIn this case, the neighbor acquired title to the farm through adverse possession, but that doesn't necessarily affect the easement, especially since the easement was appurtenant to his land.\n\nOption C says he loses because instead of using his easement, he used all of the farm.\n\nThis seems a bit vague. He used the farm through adverse possession, but that doesn't directly impact the easement, which was a separate right appurtenant to his land.\n\nSo, overall, I think option D is the correct answer: the neighbor will win because mere non-use of an easement doesn't extinguish it.\n\nTherefore, the court will likely order the woman to remove the chain and allow the neighbor to use the easement of way to access his adjacent tract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
