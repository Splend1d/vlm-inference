                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these options would shift the demand curve for the Mexican peso to the left. I need to recall what causes a shift in demand for a currency. Generally, demand for a currency can be influenced by several factors like interest rates, inflation rates, speculation, and the demand for the country's goods and services.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says speculation that the peso will increase in value. If people speculate that the peso will appreciate, meaning it will be worth more in the future, then they might want to buy more pesos now to take advantage of that expected increase. That should increase the demand for pesos, right? So, that would shift the demand curve to the right, not to the left. So, this doesn't seem to be the answer.\n\nOption B mentions an increase in interest rates in Mexico relative to other countries. Higher interest rates typically attract foreign capital because investors can get better returns on their investments. This should increase the demand for pesos as foreign investors buy pesos to invest in Mexico. So, again, this should shift the demand curve to the right. Not what we're looking for here.\n\nOption C talks about a lower rate of inflation in Mexico relative to other countries. Lower inflation makes a country's currency more valuable because the purchasing power is higher. This should make the peso more attractive to holders, thus increasing demand. Again, this would shift the demand curve to the right.\n\nOption D mentions a decrease in the international demand for Mexican-made textiles. Textiles are one of Mexico's exports, so if the demand for them decreases internationally, that means fewer people are buying Mexican textiles. This would likely lead to a decrease in the demand for pesos because fewer transactions are happening that require converting other currencies to pesos to buy these goods.\n\nWait a minute, that makes sense. If there's less demand for Mexican exports, then there's less need for other countries' residents to buy pesos to pay for those exports. So, the demand for pesos would decrease, shifting the demand curve to the left.\n\nLet me double-check this. In economics, the demand for a currency is primarily driven by the demand for the country's goods, services, and assets. So, if the demand for Mexican goods (like textiles) decreases, that should decrease the demand for pesos, causing the demand curve to shift to the left.\n\nAll the other options seem to suggest increases in demand for the peso, either through speculation, higher interest rates, or lower inflation. So, based on this, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way option D could affect the demand for pesos. Maybe if the demand for textiles decreases, but other exports increase, offsetting this effect. But the question specifies a decrease in the international demand for Mexican-made textiles, and doesn't mention any corresponding increase in other sectors. So, it's reasonable to conclude that this would lead to a leftward shift in the demand curve for the Mexican peso.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it. The answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
