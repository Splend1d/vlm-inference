                    "text": "So I've got this question here, and it's a bit tricky. It says: \"Hare refers to people who endorse ideals without regard for whether people's interests are pursued by them as:\n\nA. fanatics.\n\nB. amoralists.\n\nC. immoralists.\n\nD. maniacs.\"\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what Hare is referring to here. I think Hare might be referring to R.M. Hare, who was a British philosopher known for his work in moral philosophy, particularly in developing a form of universal prescriptivism. But I'm not entirely sure, so I'll have to be careful.\n\nThe question is about people who endorse ideals but don't care whether these ideals actually serve people's interests. So, these are people who are all about the ideals, regardless of whether these ideals help or harm people's interests. I need to find the term that best describes such people from the given options.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Fanatics: A fanatic is someone who has an excessive enthusiasm or devotion to a particular cause or idea. They might be so obsessed with their beliefs that they ignore other considerations, possibly including people's interests.\n\nB. Amoralists: An amoralist is someone who doesn't have moral principles or doesn't consider moral implications in their actions. They might not care about people's interests if those interests involve moral considerations.\n\nC. Immoralists: An immoralist is someone who actively goes against moral principles, doing things that are considered wrong or unethical. If someone endorses ideals that harm people's interests, they might be considered an immoralist.\n\nD. Maniacs: A maniac is someone who is mentally unstable or has a tendency towards violent or erratic behavior. This seems a bit strong for just endorsing ideals without considering people's interests.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. The key here is that these people endorse ideals without considering whether these ideals serve people's interests. So, it's not necessarily that they're acting against people's interests, but that they're prioritizing ideals over people's interests.\n\nA fanatic might be so devoted to an ideal that they overlook the consequences on people's interests, but they might not necessarily be acting against moral principles.\n\nAn amoralist doesn't consider moral principles, so they might not care about people's interests if it's a moral issue.\n\nAn immoralist actively goes against moral principles, which might involve harming people's interests.\n\nA maniac seems too extreme for this context.\n\nI think the closest fit here is A. fanatics because they're excessively devoted to ideals and might overlook the impact on people's interests. But I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the context of Hare's philosophy. R.M. Hare was involved in moral philosophy, particularly in ethical theories like utilitarianism. He talked about \"act\" and \"rule\" utilitarianism, where the goal is to maximize happiness or utility.\n\nIf Hare is referring to people who endorse ideals without considering people's interests, perhaps he's talking about people who are so focused on abstract principles that they ignore the practical consequences on individuals.\n\nIn that case, maybe amoralists or immoralists are more fitting, as they don't consider moral implications, which could include people's interests.\n\nBut the question specifies that these people endorse ideals without regard for people's interests. Fanatics might endorse ideals strongly, but not necessarily without regard for people's interests. They might just be so passionate that they don't see the negative impacts.\n\nImmoralists would be those who actively go against moral principles, which might include harming people's interests.\n\nAmoralists don't consider moral principles at all, so they might not care about people's interests if those interests involve moral considerations.\n\nManiacs seem out of place here; they're more about mental instability or violent behavior.\n\nI'm still leaning towards A. fanatics, but I'm not entirely confident. Maybe I should look up R.M. Hare's writings to see if he uses any of these terms specifically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this question is referring to another philosopher named Hare. I need to make sure I'm thinking about the right person.\n\nAssuming it's R.M. Hare, and considering his focus on moral philosophy, maybe he uses the term \"amoralist\" to describe people who don't consider moral implications, including people's interests.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"Hare refers to people who endorse ideals without regard for whether people's interests are pursued by them as,\" and then gives options. It seems like it's asking for the term Hare uses, not necessarily defining it.\n\nPerhaps Hare uses one of these terms specifically to describe such people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a question about how Hare characterizes certain types of moral agents.\n\nGiven that, perhaps Hare refers to such people as fanatics, since they're excessively devoted to ideals without considering the practical consequences.\n\nBut I feel like I should have more context to answer this accurately.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's consider the definition of each term:\n\n- Fanatic: a person who is excessively enthusiastic or devoted to a cause or idea.\n\n- Amoralist: a person who does not believe in or follow moral principles; morally neutral.\n\n- Immoralist: a person who deliberately violates moral principles; wicked.\n\n- Maniac: a person who is mentally unstable, especially one who is violent or erratic.\n\nGiven these definitions, which term best fits someone who endorses ideals without considering whether those ideals serve people's interests?\n\nA fanatic might be so devoted to the ideal that they don't see the negative impacts on people's interests, but they aren't necessarily acting immorally or without moral principles.\n\nAn amoralist doesn't consider moral principles, so they might not care about people's interests if those interests involve moral considerations.\n\nAn immoralist actively goes against moral principles, which might involve harming people's interests.\n\nA maniac seems too extreme for this context.\n\nSo, again, I'm leaning towards A. fanatics, but I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider an example. Suppose someone endorses the ideal of absolute freedom of speech without considering whether this ideal protects or harms people's interests in specific cases. Would Hare call this person a fanatic, amoralist, immoralist, or maniac?\n\nProbably not a maniac, as that seems too strong. Maybe a fanatic, since they're so devoted to the ideal of free speech that they don't see the potential harms.\n\nBut an amoralist might also fit, as they don't consider the moral implications of whether free speech serves people's interests in all cases.\n\nAn immoralist would be someone who actively uses free speech to harm others, which isn't necessarily the case here.\n\nGiven that, perhaps B. amoralists is a better answer, because they don't consider the moral aspect of whether the ideals serve people's interests.\n\nBut I'm still not confident. Maybe both fanatics and amoralists could fit in different ways.\n\nLet me think about another example. Suppose someone endorses environmental protection ideals without considering whether these ideals serve the economic interests of a community. Would Hare call this person a fanatic, amoralist, immoralist, or maniac?\n\nAgain, probably not a maniac. Maybe a fanatic, since they're so devoted to environmental ideals that they overlook the economic impacts.\n\nAn amoralist might not consider the moral implications of economic impacts, so they might also fit.\n\nAn immoralist would be someone who uses environmental protection to harm others, which isn't necessarily the case.\n\nSo, again, both fanatics and amoralists could fit, but perhaps amoralists are more accurate because they don't consider the moral aspect of people's interests.\n\nWait, but the question says \"without regard for whether people's interests are pursued by them.\" So, it's not just that they don't consider people's interests, but they don't care whether the ideals serve those interests or not.\n\nAn amoralist might not consider the moral implications, including people's interests, but a fanatic might be so devoted to the ideal that they believe it will serve people's interests, even if in practice it doesn't.\n\nSo, perhaps a fanatic does consider people's interests, but in a misguided way, while an amoralist doesn't consider them at all.\n\nGiven that, maybe B. amoralists is the best answer, as they don't consider the moral implications of whether people's interests are served by the ideals.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up how Hare uses these terms in his work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a question from a textbook or a specific course, and Hare uses one of these terms in a particular way.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options, I'll go with B. amoralists as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
