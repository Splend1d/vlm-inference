                    "text": "So Elizabeth has some stickers, and she divides them equally among herself and two friends. That means there are three people in total, right? Elizabeth and two friends make three people. And each person gets 4 stickers. So, I need to find out which equation represents the total number of stickers, s.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. If each person gets 4 stickers and there are 3 people, then the total number of stickers should be 4 stickers per person times 3 people. So, s = 4 * 3, which is s = 12.\n\nNow, I need to see which equation matches this. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. s + 3 = 4\n\nIf I solve for s, s = 4 - 3, which is s = 1. That's not matching our total of 12.\n\nB. s - 3 = 4\n\nSolving for s, s = 4 + 3, which is s = 7. Still not 12.\n\nC. s/3 = 4\n\nIf I multiply both sides by 3, s = 12. That matches our total of 12.\n\nD. 3s = 4\n\nDividing both sides by 3, s = 4/3, which is approximately 1.333, but that doesn't make sense in this context because we know s should be 12.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems to be the correct one.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. If s/3 = 4, then s = 12, which matches our calculation. And in the problem, it says \"each person gets 4 stickers,\" and there are three people, so total stickers should indeed be 12.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Maybe using the concept of division or something else.\n\nIf Elizabeth divides her stickers equally among three people, and each gets 4, then total stickers are 3 times 4, which is 12. So, s = 3 * 4.\n\nAlternatively, if we think about it as s divided by 3 equals 4, which is s/3 = 4, leading to s = 12.\n\nAgain, this points to option C being correct.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. Is there any possibility of miscounting the number of people?\n\nWell, Elizabeth and two friends make three people, as I thought earlier. Unless there are more friends or something, but the problem seems straightforward.\n\nAlso, considering that stickers can't be fractional, s must be a multiple of 3, since it's divided equally among three people. So, s divided by 3 should be an integer, which is 4 in this case.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and option C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
