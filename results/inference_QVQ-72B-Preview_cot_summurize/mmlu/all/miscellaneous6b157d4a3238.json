The options are Canton, Ohio; Cooperstown, New York; Springfield, Massachusetts; and Lawrence, Kansas. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think I can eliminate some of these by recalling where other sports halls of fame are.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Pro Football Hall of Fame is in Canton, Ohio. So, since that's for football, not basketball, maybe the Basketball Hall of Fame isn't there. But, you never know, maybe they have multiple halls in one place.\n\nNext, Cooperstown, New York, is famous for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. Again, that's baseball, so probably not where the Basketball Hall of Fame is located.\n\nThen there's Springfield, Massachusetts. I think I remember that basketball was invented in Springfield. There was a doctor named James Naismith who invented the game there in 1891. That seems like a likely place for the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nLastly, Lawrence, Kansas. I know that the University of Kansas has a strong basketball program, but I don't recall any hall of fame being there.\n\nLet me double-check. The Basketball Hall of Fame is officially called the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. That name suggests that it's in honor of James Naismith, who, as I recall, was in Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\nI think the correct answer is Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\nWait a minute, I should make sure. Maybe I can think of some famous basketball players or coaches who are from these areas. For example, from Canton, Ohio, there's LeBron James, but again, that's more related to playing rather than the hall of fame location.\n\nFrom Cooperstown, New York, many baseball legends are honored, but again, that's baseball.\n\nFrom Springfield, Massachusetts, since it's where basketball was invented, it makes sense that the hall of fame is there.\n\nFrom Lawrence, Kansas, the University of Kansas Jayhawks have a rich basketball history, but I don't think the hall of fame is there.\n\nI'm feeling pretty confident about this. I'll go with Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Springfield Massachusetts}} \\]"
