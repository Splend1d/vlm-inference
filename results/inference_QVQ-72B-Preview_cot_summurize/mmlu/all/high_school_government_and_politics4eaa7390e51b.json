                    "text": "So I have this question here about the spoils system and the merit system in civil service jobs. It's asking what replaced the spoils system with the merit system, and the options are the Truman Doctrine, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1961, the National Industrial Recovery Act, or the Pendleton Act of 1883.\n\nFirst off, I need to make sure I understand what the spoils system and the merit system are. The spoils system is when government jobs are given to political supporters or friends of the elected officials, right? Like, \"to the victor belong the spoils.\" So, it's basically rewarding your allies with jobs when you come into power.\n\nOn the other hand, the merit system is about hiring and promoting people based on their qualifications and performance. So, it's a more fair and competitive process, where the best candidate gets the job, not just the one who knows the right people.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of these options led to the replacement of the spoils system with the merit system.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A is the Truman Doctrine. I remember learning about this in history class. It was an policy set forth by President Harry Truman in 1947, primarily focused on containing communism by providing economic and military aid to countries resisting Soviet influence. So, it seems more related to foreign policy during the Cold War era. Doesn't sound like it has a direct connection to civil service reform or replacing the spoils system.\n\nOption B is the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1961. Hmm, I know that the original Fair Labor Standards Act was passed in 1938, during the New Deal, and it dealt with things like minimum wage, overtime pay, and child labor laws. The 1961 amendment might have expanded coverage or made changes to the original act. But again, this seems more related to general labor laws rather than specifically to civil service hiring practices.\n\nOption C is the National Industrial Recovery Act. This was another New Deal legislation, passed in 1933, aimed at stimulating economic recovery during the Great Depression by allowing industries to set codes of fair competition, among other things. It also led to the creation of the Public Works Administration to fund infrastructure projects. While it did involve government spending and job creation, it doesn't seem directly tied to overhauling the civil service system.\n\nThat brings me to Option D, the Pendleton Act of 1883. This rings a bell. I think it's also known as the Civil Service Reform Act. Let me recall: it was passed in response to the assassination of President James Garfield by a disappointed office-seeker who was denied a job under the spoils system. So, this act was a reaction to the abuses of the spoils system.\n\nThe Pendleton Act established the Civil Service Commission, which was responsible for overseeing the hiring of federal employees based on merit, rather than political connections. It introduced competitive examinations for certain positions, ensuring that the most qualified candidates were selected.\n\nGiven this background, it seems clear that the Pendleton Act of 1883 was the legislation that replaced the spoils system with the merit system in civil service jobs.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if any of the other options might also be relevant.\n\nThe Truman Doctrine was about foreign policy in the post-World War II era, which doesn't directly relate to civil service reform.\n\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act of 1961 was an amendment to existing labor laws, focusing on wages and working conditions, not specifically on how civil service jobs are awarded.\n\nThe National Industrial Recovery Act was part of the New Deal efforts to combat the Great Depression, involving industrial regulation and public works projects, but again, not directly addressing civil service hiring practices.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is the Pendleton Act of 1883.\n\nWait a minute, I should check if there were any subsequent reforms or acts that further replaced or built upon the Pendleton Act. For instance, did the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1961 or other legislation have any impact on civil service hiring?\n\nWell, while the Fair Labor Standards Act did affect wages and working conditions, which might indirectly influence civil service, it wasn't primarily about the hiring process or the merit system. The Pendleton Act was the foundational legislation that established the principle of merit-based hiring in civil service, and subsequent acts have built upon it, but they haven't replaced it.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to say that the Pendleton Act of 1883 was the key piece of legislation that replaced the spoils system with the merit system in civil service jobs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
