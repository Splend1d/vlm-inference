                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario. It's about the admissibility of certain testimony in a trial. The plaintiff is being asked about an explosion at an oil refinery, and during direct examination, he mentions that his son ran into the house saying the car windows just shattered. Now, the son is available to testify, but the defendant's attorney wants to strike the plaintiff's answer. I need to determine whether the plaintiff's testimony is admissible or inadmissible based on the options provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. The plaintiff is recalling an event where his son made a statement about the car windows shattering. This seems like the plaintiff is repeating something that someone else said, which brings up the issue of hearsay.\n\nIn legal terms, hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Generally, hearsay is inadmissible unless it falls under an exception.\n\nSo, in this case, the plaintiff is repeating what his son said: \"the car windows just shattered.\" This is hearsay because it's not the plaintiff's own knowledge; it's something someone else told him.\n\nNow, the question is whether this falls under any hearsay exception.\n\nOption A says the testimony is admissible because the son is available as a witness. But I'm not sure about that. Just because the original declarant is available doesn't automatically make the hearsay admissible. If the son is testifying, why would the plaintiff need to repeat what the son said?\n\nOption B says it's admissible whether or not the son is available. That seems odd. If the son is not available, maybe there are different considerations.\n\nOption C says it's inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception. So, perhaps there isn't an exception that applies here.\n\nOption D says it's inadmissible under the excited utterance exception because it can be a product of reflection and deliberation. Wait, that seems contradictory. The excited utterance exception allows for certain statements made under excitement to be admissible, but option D says it's inadmissible under that exception because it could be a product of reflection and deliberation.\n\nI need to recall what the excited utterance exception is. It's a hearsay exception that allows statements made while the declarant is under the stress of excitement caused by a startling event or condition. The idea is that the statement is made spontaneously and is therefore more reliable.\n\nIn this case, the son ran into the house and screamed that the car windows just shattered. This seems like it was said in the heat of the moment, perhaps in shock or excitement caused by the explosion and the windows shattering.\n\nSo, would this fall under the excited utterance exception?\n\nWell, for the excited utterance exception to apply, a few conditions need to be met:\n\n1. There must be a startling event or condition.\n\n2. The statement must be made while the declarant is under the stress of excitement caused by that event.\n\n3. The statement must be about the event or the conditions resulting from it.\n\n4. The statement must be made spontaneously, without time for reflection or fabrication.\n\nIn this scenario, there was an explosion, which is certainly a startling event. The son ran into the house and screamed immediately after the windows shattered, which seems to be a reaction to the event. So, it appears to meet the first two conditions.\n\nHowever, I need to consider whether the statement was made spontaneously, without time for reflection. The fact that he ran into the house and immediately screamed suggests that it was a spontaneous reaction, not something he thought about before saying.\n\nBut, option D suggests that it could be a product of reflection and deliberation, which would disqualify it from the excited utterance exception.\n\nI need to think carefully about this. If the son ran into the house and screamed immediately after the windows shattered, it seems like a spontaneous statement made under excitement.\n\nBut perhaps there's a concern that he had time to think about it or exaggerate it.\n\nWait, but in the excited utterance exception, the key is that the statement is made while the declarant is still under the excitement caused by the event, reducing the likelihood of deliberate misstatement.\n\nSo, if the son made the statement immediately after the event, it's more likely to be reliable.\n\nBut the plaintiff is repeating the son's statement, which is hearsay. So, for the plaintiff to testify about what the son said, the statement needs to fit into a hearsay exception.\n\nGiven that, if the son's statement qualifies as an excited utterance, then the plaintiff can testify about it.\n\nBut the defendant's attorney is moving to strike the plaintiff's answer, arguing that it's inadmissible hearsay.\n\nSo, the question is whether the plaintiff's testimony about the son's statement is admissible under the excited utterance exception.\n\nOption A says it's admissible because the son is available as a witness. But that doesn't directly relate to the hearsay exception. Even if the son is available, the plaintiff's repetition of the statement is still hearsay unless it falls under an exception.\n\nOption B says it's admissible whether or not the son is available. That seems too broad. If the son is unavailable, perhaps there are different rules.\n\nOption C says it's inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception. But we're considering whether it fits into the excited utterance exception.\n\nOption D says it's inadmissible under the excited utterance exception because it can be a product of reflection and deliberation. But based on my earlier analysis, it seems like the statement was spontaneous.\n\nI think the key here is whether the statement was made under the stress of excitement without time for reflection. If it was, then it should be admissible under the excited utterance exception.\n\nGiven that the son ran into the house and screamed immediately after the windows shattered, it seems like a spontaneous reaction, not something thought out or deliberate.\n\nTherefore, the plaintiff's testimony about the son's statement should be admissible under the excited utterance exception.\n\nSo, the trial judge should rule the plaintiff's testimony admissible.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIs there any other hearsay exception that might apply here?\n\nWell, there's the present sense impression exception, which allows statements describing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the event or condition, or immediately thereafter.\n\nThis is similar to the excited utterance but focuses more on the declarant's perception of the event.\n\nIn this case, the son perceived the windows shattering and immediately made a statement about it. So, this could also apply.\n\nBut the excited utterance seems more directly applicable here because of the startling nature of the event.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the plaintiff's testimony is necessary. Since the son is available to testify, perhaps it's better to have the son testify directly about what he observed and said.\n\nHowever, in practice, if the plaintiff is testifying about what he heard from the son, and the statement qualifies under a hearsay exception, it can be admitted.\n\nBut perhaps there's a preference for having the original declarant testify.\n\nStill, in terms of admissibility, if the statement fits under an exception, the plaintiff can testify about it.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, I think the correct answer is that the plaintiff's testimony is admissible, whether or not the son is available as a witness, provided that the statement qualifies under the excited utterance exception.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. admissible, whether or not the son is available as a witness.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
