                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the ancient city of Uruk from The Epic of Gilgamesh. The question is asking which statement about ancient cities is most supported by the discussion of Uruk in the second paragraph. The options are:\n\nA. Ancient cities lacked effective fortifications against attack.\n\nB. Ancient cities featured areas for worshipping their patron deities.\n\nC. Ancient cities commonly decorated their temples in modest ways.\n\nD. Ancient cities featured areas for training their armies.\n\nFirst, I need to carefully read the second paragraph to understand what it says about Uruk.\n\nIt says:\n\n\"Of Uruk, its great rampart he built, and the wall of the sacred Eanna temple, the holy sanctuary. Behold the outer walls which gleam with the brilliance of copper; see the inner wall which none might rival. Touch the threshold stone\u2014it is from ancient days. Goest thou into the Eanna temple, yea, the dwelling place of Ishtar, the like of which no subsequent king or living man might equal. Ascend and walk about on the wall of Uruk, inspect the corner-stone, and examine its brick-work, whether its wall is not made of burned brick, and its foundation laid by the Seven Sages. One third for city, one third for garden, one third for field, and a precinct for the temple of Ishtar. These parts and the precinct comprise Uruk.\"\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, it mentions that Gilgamesh built the great rampart of Uruk and the wall of the sacred Eanna temple, which is a holy sanctuary. This suggests that the city had significant defensive structures, like walls and ramparts, and also important religious buildings.\n\nIt also describes the outer walls gleaming with copper and inner walls that were unrivaled. This indicates that the city was not only fortified but also decorated in a way that showcased wealth and craftsmanship.\n\nThe Eanna temple is described as the dwelling place of Ishtar, and it was so impressive that no subsequent king or living man could equal it. This points to the temple being a major religious site and a point of pride for the city.\n\nAdditionally, it mentions that the city is divided into parts: one third city, one third garden, one third field, and a precinct for the temple of Ishtar. This suggests a planned layout with designated areas for different purposes.\n\nNow, let's look at the options again in light of this information.\n\nOption A: Ancient cities lacked effective fortifications against attack.\n\nBut according to the passage, Gilgamesh built great ramparts and walls for Uruk, which implies that the city did have fortifications. Moreover, these fortifications were praised, suggesting they were effective or at least impressive. So, this contradicts option A.\n\nOption B: Ancient cities featured areas for worshipping their patron deities.\n\nThe passage mentions the Eanna temple, which is dedicated to Ishtar, and it was a significant structure in the city. It even has a precinct set aside for the temple. This suggests that worship and deities were important parts of the city's layout and life. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption C: Ancient cities commonly decorated their temples in modest ways.\n\nThe description of the Eanna temple suggests it was magnificent, not modest. It was so impressive that no subsequent king could equal it, and it was adorned with copper and fine brickwork. Therefore, this option doesn't align with the information provided.\n\nOption D: Ancient cities featured areas for training their armies.\n\nThe passage doesn't mention anything specifically about areas for training armies. It talks about fortifications and temples but doesn't provide information about military training grounds.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that is most supported by the discussion of Uruk in the second paragraph is option B: Ancient cities featured areas for worshipping their patron deities.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's double-check.\n\nThe passage clearly mentions the Eanna temple, which is a place of worship for Ishtar, and that it had a precinct set aside for it. Additionally, the temple was described in awe-inspiring terms, indicating its importance in the city. There's no mention of lack of fortifications, modest decorations, or training areas for armies.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
