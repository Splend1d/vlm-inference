                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario involves. In Scenario 1, the person couldn't afford a new computer, so they took a credit card from their dad's wallet to pay for it. In Scenario 2, the person is feeding their infant wet cat food three times a day. So, basically, one is about taking something without permission, and the other is about feeding a baby something that's not meant for humans.\n\nLet me consider Scenario 1 first. Taking a credit card from dad's wallet without asking to buy a new computer. Is this morally wrong? Well, stealing is generally considered wrong. Even if it's from a family member, taking something without permission is still wrong. It's not just about the law, but about respect and trust within the family. So, in this case, I think it's wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2. Feeding an infant wet cat food three times a day. Hmm, that sounds off. Cat food is not made for humans, and infants have specific nutritional needs. Feeding them something that's not intended for human consumption could be harmful. It might lack essential nutrients or even contain ingredients that are unsafe for humans. So, from that perspective, it seems morally wrong to put a child's health at risk like that.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are some circumstances I don't know about. For example, perhaps the person couldn't afford baby food and thought cat food was a cheap alternative. Or maybe they didn't know any better. Still, ignorance doesn't make it right, and if you're responsible for a child, you should make an effort to provide proper nutrition.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the person is mixing the cat food with something else or using it as a substitute temporarily. But the scenario says \"three times a day,\" which suggests it's a regular practice, not just a one-time mistake.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, both seem to involve actions that are morally questionable. Taking a credit card without permission is a breach of trust and essentially stealing, while feeding a baby cat food is neglectful and potentially harmful.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both scenarios would be considered morally wrong. So, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider if there's any context that might change this conclusion. For instance, perhaps the dad gave implicit permission for using the credit card, but the scenario says the person took it from the wallet without specifying any permission. So, it's safe to assume it was without consent.\n\nAs for feeding the infant, it's hard to imagine a scenario where wet cat food is an acceptable part of a baby's diet. Infant nutrition is crucial for development, and there are clear guidelines on what to feed babies at different ages. Cat food doesn't meet those guidelines and could be dangerous.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that both actions are morally wrong. The answer is A. Wrong, Wrong."
