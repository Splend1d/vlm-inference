                    "text": "Let's see here. Yesterday, one euro was worth $1.36 US, and today it's worth $1.40 US. So, the euro's price in terms of the US dollar has gone up, right? That means the euro is more expensive now in US dollars.\n\nOption A says the US dollar has appreciated. Appreciation means the currency has become more valuable compared to others. But here, the euro is now buying more US dollars than before, which suggests that the euro has appreciated, not the US dollar. So, option A is probably wrong.\n\nOption B says the euro has depreciated. But that would mean the euro has become less valuable, which contradicts the fact that it's now buying more US dollars. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nOption C says interest rates in the United States have decreased. Well, changes in interest rates can affect currency values, but without more information, it's hard to say for sure. Maybe, but I need to think about this more.\n\nOption D says the euro has appreciated. That seems to align with what I observed earlier. The euro is now buying more US dollars, which means it has increased in value relative to the US dollar.\n\nLet me double-check this. If the euro was at $1.36 and now it's at $1.40, that means it takes fewer euros to buy the same amount of US dollars, which indeed suggests appreciation of the euro against the US dollar.\n\nWait a minute, but could it also be that the US dollar has depreciated? Appreciation and depreciation are relative terms; if one currency appreciates, the other depreciates in relation to it. So, in this case, since the euro has appreciated against the US dollar, it implies that the US dollar has depreciated against the euro.\n\nBut the question is asking which of the following is true, and option A says the US dollar has appreciated, which contradicts what I just thought. So, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B says the euro has depreciated, which again, based on the exchange rate increase, is the opposite of what's happening. So, that's probably wrong too.\n\nOption C mentions that interest rates in the United States have decreased. While changes in interest rates can influence exchange rates, the information provided doesn't directly support this conclusion. So, without more context, it's not clear if this is true.\n\nOption D clearly states that the euro has appreciated, which matches my initial assessment.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor that could affect this. Perhaps the demand for euros has increased, leading to its appreciation against the US dollar. Or maybe there's been a change in the supply of US dollars in the market.\n\nBut the question is straightforward: it provides two exchange rates for the euro against the US dollar on consecutive days and asks which statement is true based on this information.\n\nGiven that, the most direct conclusion is that the euro has appreciated against the US dollar, which corresponds to option D.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
