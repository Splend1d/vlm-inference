                    "text": "Let's tackle this banking problem. So, the scenario is that a bank has $1000 in checking deposits, and it's required to reserve $250. I need to find the reserve ratio, the excess reserves, and the money multiplier. The options are given, but I want to understand how to calculate these values.\n\nFirst up, the reserve ratio. I remember that the reserve ratio is the fraction of deposits that a bank is required to hold as reserves. So, if the bank has $1000 in deposits and needs to reserve $250, the reserve ratio should be $250 divided by $1000. Let's do that math:\n\nReserve ratio = $250 / $1000 = 0.25, or 25%.\n\nOkay, so the reserve ratio is 25%. That narrows down the options.\n\nNext, excess reserves. Excess reserves are the funds that a bank holds above the required reserves. So, if the bank has total reserves of $250 (assuming that's what they're holding), but wait, the problem says they are required to reserve $250. But I don't know how much they actually hold; maybe they hold more.\n\nWait, the problem says the bank is required to reserve $250, but it doesn't specify how much they actually hold. Hmm, maybe I need to assume that they hold exactly the required amount, in which case, excess reserves would be zero. But that doesn't seem right because typically, banks might hold more than the required reserves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the required reserves are part of the total reserves, and excess reserves are the remaining. But without knowing the total reserves, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me recall that the money multiplier is calculated as 1 divided by the reserve ratio. So, if the reserve ratio is 25%, or 0.25, then the money multiplier M would be 1 / 0.25 = 4.\n\nWait, but one of the options has M = 4, and another has M = 1/4, which is 0.25. So, based on my calculation, M should be 4.\n\nNow, considering that, let's see what excess reserves would be. If the bank has $1000 in deposits and a 25% reserve ratio, required reserves are $250, as given. If they hold exactly $250 in reserves, then excess reserves are zero. But that seems off because banks usually hold some excess reserves for safety.\n\nBut maybe in this problem, we can assume that the bank is holding exactly the required reserves, meaning excess reserves are zero. But looking at the options, none of them have excess reserves as zero.\n\nOption A: 25% $750 M = \u00bc -- This has M = 1/4, which is incorrect based on my calculation.\n\nOption B: 75% $250 M = 4 -- Reserve ratio is incorrect.\n\nOption C: 25% $750 M = 4 -- Reserve ratio is correct, but excess reserves are $750, which seems high.\n\nOption D: 75% $750 M = 1/4 -- Both reserve ratio and money multiplier are incorrect.\n\nHmm, seems like there might be some confusion in the options. Based on my calculations, the reserve ratio should be 25%, and the money multiplier should be 4. But none of the options perfectly match my calculations.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let's read it again: \"If a bank has $1000 in checking deposits and the bank is required to reserve $250 what is the reserve ratio? How much does the bank have in excess reserves? What is the size of the money multiplier?\"\n\nSo, required reserves are $250, and total deposits are $1000. Reserve ratio is $250/$1000 = 25%, which seems correct.\n\nNow, excess reserves are total reserves minus required reserves. But I don't know the total reserves. Maybe I need to assume that the bank holds more than the required reserves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bank holds exactly $250 in reserves, meaning excess reserves are zero. But that doesn't align with the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $1000 in deposits is the total reserves. Wait, no, deposits are different from reserves.\n\nLet me recall that reserves are a part of deposits. In reality, banks lend out a portion of deposits and keep a portion as reserves.\n\nSo, if deposits are $1000 and required reserves are $250, then total reserves could be more than $250 if the bank chooses to hold excess reserves.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how much total reserves the bank holds, only that it's required to reserve $250.\n\nPerhaps I need to assume that the bank holds exactly $250 in reserves, which satisfies the required reserves, meaning excess reserves are zero.\n\nBut again, that doesn't match any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bank holds $1000 in deposits, and the required reserves are $250, and the rest is excess reserves. So, excess reserves would be $1000 - $250 = $750.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because excess reserves are reserves above the required reserves, not deposits above reserves.\n\nI'm getting confused. Let me try to rephrase.\n\nReserves come from deposits; banks keep a certain percentage of deposits as reserves and lend out the rest.\n\nSo, if the required reserve ratio is 25%, then for every dollar deposited, the bank must keep 25 cents in reserve.\n\nGiven that, if deposits are $1000, required reserves are $250.\n\nIf the bank holds exactly $250 in reserves, then excess reserves are zero.\n\nBut if the bank holds more than $250 in reserves, then excess reserves are the amount above $250.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't specify how much total reserves the bank holds, only that it's required to hold $250.\n\nMaybe I need to assume that the bank holds exactly $250 in reserves, meaning excess reserves are zero.\n\nBut that doesn't match any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the $1000 is the reserve amount, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of the money multiplier.\n\nThe money multiplier is 1 / reserve ratio = 1 / 0.25 = 4, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, if the reserve ratio is 25%, the money multiplier should be 4.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption A: 25% $750 M = 1/4 -- Incorrect money multiplier.\n\nOption B: 75% $250 M = 4 -- Incorrect reserve ratio.\n\nOption C: 25% $750 M = 4 -- Correct reserve ratio and money multiplier, but excess reserves are $750.\n\nOption D: 75% $750 M = 1/4 -- Incorrect on multiple fronts.\n\nSo, option C seems to have the correct reserve ratio and money multiplier, but the excess reserves are $750, which doesn't align with my earlier assumption that excess reserves are zero if the bank holds exactly the required reserves.\n\nPerhaps the bank holds total reserves of $1000, which includes required reserves of $250 and excess reserves of $750.\n\nIn that case, excess reserves would indeed be $750.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the standard assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $1000 is the total reserves, and required reserves are $250, making excess reserves $750.\n\nThat would make option C correct: 25% reserve ratio, $750 excess reserves, and money multiplier of 4.\n\nYes, that seems to fit.\n\nSo, the answer should be Option C: 25% $750 M = 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
