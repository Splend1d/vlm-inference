                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to figure out which of these options would cause the biggest decrease in real GDP. It's about government spending and taxes, right? I think government spending and taxes can affect the economy in different ways, so I need to understand how each option would impact the overall economy.\n\nFirst, let's recall some basic macroeconomics. Real GDP is a measure of the total production of an economy, adjusted for inflation. Anything that reduces overall production or demand in the economy could lead to a decrease in real GDP.\n\nOption A says the government decreases spending matched with a decrease in taxes. So, if the government spends less and also decreases taxes, what does that mean? Decreasing spending might reduce aggregate demand, but decreasing taxes could potentially increase consumer spending, right? Because people have more disposable income. So, maybe these effects could offset each other, or perhaps the decrease in government spending could dominate, leading to a decrease in real GDP. But I'm not sure how much.\n\nOption B is the government increases spending with no increase in taxes. This seems straightforward. Increasing government spending should increase aggregate demand, which should lead to an increase in real GDP, not a decrease. So, this probably isn't the answer.\n\nOption C is the government decreases spending with no change in taxes. So, if the government spends less but doesn't change taxes, that means less money is being pumped into the economy from the government side, and taxes remain the same, so consumers' disposable income doesn't change. This should lead to a decrease in aggregate demand, which could reduce real GDP. But how much of a decrease?\n\nOption D says the government holds spending constant while increasing taxes. So, if taxes go up but spending stays the same, that means consumers have less disposable income because they're paying more in taxes. That could lead to reduced consumer spending, which is a component of aggregate demand. If consumers spend less, that could lead to a decrease in real GDP.\n\nNow, comparing options C and D: in option C, only government spending decreases, while taxes stay the same. In option D, government spending is constant, but taxes increase, leading to reduced consumer spending.\n\nI need to think about which of these would cause a larger decrease in real GDP. Government spending is one component of aggregate demand, and consumer spending is another, and usually, consumer spending is a larger part of aggregate demand compared to government spending.\n\nSo, if government spending decreases, that's one part of aggregate demand decreasing (option C). But if taxes increase, leading to decreased consumer spending (option D), that might have a larger impact because consumer spending is a bigger component of aggregate demand.\n\nWait, but I need to consider the multiplier effects as well. When government spending decreases, it directly reduces aggregate demand, but it also indirectly affects other parts of the economy. Similarly, if taxes increase, consumer spending decreases, which also has multiplier effects.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of the multiplier formula. The multiplier is 1/(1-MPC), where MPC is the marginal propensity to consume. So, any change in government spending or taxes will be multiplied by this factor to get the total change in GDP.\n\nIn option A, decrease in government spending and decrease in taxes. The net effect would be the decrease in government spending minus the increase in consumer spending due to the tax cut. Depending on the sizes, this could result in a net decrease or increase in aggregate demand.\n\nIn option B, increase in government spending with no tax increase. This should increase aggregate demand and thus increase real GDP.\n\nIn option C, decrease in government spending with no tax change. This should decrease aggregate demand and thus decrease real GDP.\n\nIn option D, no change in government spending but increase in taxes. This should decrease consumer spending and thus decrease aggregate demand and real GDP.\n\nBetween options C and D, which one would cause a greater decrease in real GDP? Well, government spending is a direct component of GDP (G), while consumer spending (C) is another major component. In most economies, consumer spending is much larger than government spending. So, a change in consumer spending due to a tax increase might have a larger impact on GDP than a similar change in government spending.\n\nMoreover, the tax increase affects not just the direct reduction in disposable income but also the indirect effects through the multiplier. So, if taxes increase, consumers have less income to spend, leading to reduced consumption, which then affects production and income in other sectors, leading to further reductions in consumption and so on.\n\nSimilarly, if government spending decreases, that directly reduces GDP, and through the multiplier effect, it leads to further reductions in income and spending.\n\nBut given that consumer spending is a larger component of GDP than government spending, a change in consumer spending might have a larger impact on GDP.\n\nLet me try to quantify this a bit. Suppose the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.75. That means the multiplier is 1/(1-0.75) = 4.\n\nIf government spending decreases by $100 million, the total decrease in GDP would be $100 million multiplied by 4, which is $400 million.\n\nIf taxes increase by an amount that reduces consumer spending by $100 million, the total decrease in GDP would be $100 million multiplied by 4, which is also $400 million.\n\nHmm, in this case, both options C and D seem to have the same multiplier effect. But I thought earlier that consumer spending was a larger component, so maybe the impact would be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the size of the changes. If the decrease in government spending is matched by a decrease in taxes that leads to an increase in consumer spending, then option A might have a smaller net decrease in aggregate demand compared to option C where only government spending decreases.\n\nBut in option D, increasing taxes while keeping government spending constant would reduce consumer spending, which could lead to a larger decrease in aggregate demand compared to option C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to look at it. Perhaps I should consider the balanced budget multiplier, which suggests that increases in government spending and taxes have offsetting effects on aggregate demand.\n\nBut in option A, both government spending and taxes decrease, which might have a similar but negative effect on aggregate demand.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to rephrase.\n\nIn option A: decrease in government spending and decrease in taxes. The decrease in government spending reduces aggregate demand, but the decrease in taxes increases disposable income, which could increase consumer spending, partially or fully offsetting the decrease in government spending.\n\nIn option B: increase in government spending with no tax increase. This should directly increase aggregate demand and thus increase real GDP.\n\nIn option C: decrease in government spending with no tax change. This should decrease aggregate demand and thus decrease real GDP.\n\nIn option D: no change in government spending but increase in taxes. This reduces disposable income and thus consumer spending, leading to a decrease in aggregate demand and real GDP.\n\nSo, between options C and D, which one would cause a greater decrease in real GDP?\n\nGiven that consumer spending is a larger component of GDP than government spending, a decrease in consumer spending due to higher taxes might lead to a larger decrease in real GDP compared to a decrease in government spending.\n\nMoreover, the multiplier effect might be larger for consumer spending because consumers spread their spending across various sectors, while government spending might be more targeted.\n\nBut I need to think about the actual multipliers. Let's assume the MPC is 0.75, so the multiplier is 4.\n\nIf government spending decreases by $100 million, the total decrease in GDP is $400 million.\n\nIf taxes increase by an amount that reduces consumer spending by $100 million, the total decrease in GDP is also $400 million.\n\nBut wait, the tax increase reduces disposable income, and assuming the MPC is 0.75, the decrease in consumer spending would be the tax increase multiplied by the MPC.\n\nSo, if taxes increase by $100 million, consumer spending decreases by $100 million * 0.75 = $75 million. Then, the total decrease in GDP would be $75 million multiplied by the multiplier of 4, which is $300 million.\n\nWait, that's different from the previous calculation. Earlier, I thought decreasing government spending by $100 million leads to a $400 million decrease in GDP, while increasing taxes by $100 million leads to a $300 million decrease in GDP.\n\nBut according to this, option D (increasing taxes by $100 million) leads to a smaller decrease in GDP compared to option C (decreasing government spending by $100 million).\n\nThat contradicts my earlier thought that option D would cause a larger decrease.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently. Let's consider the tax multiplier.\n\nThe tax multiplier is -MPC/(1-MPC). So, with MPC=0.75, the tax multiplier is -0.75/(1-0.75) = -0.75/0.25 = -3.\n\nSo, if taxes increase by $100 million, the total change in GDP would be $100 million * (-3) = - $300 million.\n\nOn the other hand, the government spending multiplier is simply the multiplier, which is 1/(1-MPC) = 4.\n\nSo, decreasing government spending by $100 million would lead to a $400 million decrease in GDP.\n\nTherefore, option C (decreasing government spending by $100 million) leads to a larger decrease in GDP compared to option D (increasing taxes by $100 million, leading to a $300 million decrease).\n\nWait, but in option D, increasing taxes by $100 million reduces consumer spending by $75 million (since MPC is 0.75), and the total decrease in GDP is $75 million * 4 = $300 million, as I calculated earlier.\n\nBut according to the tax multiplier, it's $100 million * (-3) = - $300 million, which matches.\n\nSo, in this case, option C leads to a $400 million decrease, while option D leads to a $300 million decrease.\n\nBut what if the tax increase leads to a larger decrease in consumer spending?\n\nSuppose the MPC is higher, say 0.9. Then the multiplier is 1/(1-0.9) = 10, and the tax multiplier is -0.9/(1-0.9) = -9.\n\nSo, if taxes increase by $100 million, the total decrease in GDP would be $900 million.\n\nSimilarly, if government spending decreases by $100 million, the total decrease in GDP would be $1000 million.\n\nIn this case, option C still leads to a larger decrease.\n\nBut in the earlier case with MPC=0.75, option C leads to a larger decrease.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the specific values.\n\nLet me assume MPC=0.75.\n\nThen:\n\n- Option C: decrease in government spending by $100 million \u2192 total decrease in GDP = $400 million.\n\n- Option D: increase in taxes by $100 million \u2192 decrease in consumer spending = $75 million \u2192 total decrease in GDP = $75 million * 4 = $300 million.\n\nSo, option C leads to a larger decrease.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that since consumer spending is a larger component, its impact would be larger.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the size of the multipliers and the initial changes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the concept of fiscal policy and the impact of changes in government spending and taxes on aggregate demand.\n\nIn option A, decreasing government spending and decreasing taxes: the net effect depends on how much consumer spending increases due to the tax cut compared to the decrease in government spending.\n\nIf the tax cut leads to a sufficient increase in consumer spending, it could offset the decrease in government spending, leading to a smaller net decrease in aggregate demand.\n\nIn option B, increasing government spending with no tax increase: this should directly increase aggregate demand and thus increase real GDP.\n\nIn option C, decreasing government spending with no tax change: this should decrease aggregate demand and thus decrease real GDP.\n\nIn option D, holding government spending constant while increasing taxes: this should decrease consumer spending and thus decrease aggregate demand and real GDP.\n\nNow, between options C and D, which one would cause a greater decrease in real GDP?\n\nGiven the multipliers I calculated earlier, option C seems to cause a larger decrease.\n\nBut I have a feeling that option D might actually cause a larger decrease because consumer spending is a larger component of GDP.\n\nMaybe I need to think about the income-expenditure model.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nSuppose GDP = C + I + G + (X - M), where C is consumption, I is investment, G is government spending, X is exports, M is imports.\n\nAssume closed economy, so X = M = 0.\n\nThen, GDP = C + I + G.\n\nConsumption C = c0 + c1(Y - T), where c1 is the MPC.\n\nGovernment spending G is exogenous.\n\nTaxes T are exogenous.\n\nInvestment I is exogenous.\n\nThen, equilibrium GDP is:\n\nY = c0 + c1(Y - T) + I + G.\n\nRearranging:\n\nY - c1 Y = c0 - c1 T + I + G.\n\nY(1 - c1) = c0 - c1 T + I + G.\n\nTherefore, Y = [c0 - c1 T + I + G]/(1 - c1).\n\nNow, let's find the multipliers.\n\nFirst, the government spending multiplier:\n\ndY/dG = 1/(1 - c1).\n\nWith c1 = 0.75, dY/dG = 1/(1 - 0.75) = 4.\n\nSo, for every $1 increase in G, Y increases by $4.\n\nSimilarly, for a decrease in G by $1, Y decreases by $4.\n\nNow, the tax multiplier:\n\ndY/dT = -c1/(1 - c1).\n\nWith c1 = 0.75, dY/dT = -0.75/(1 - 0.75) = -0.75/0.25 = -3.\n\nSo, for every $1 increase in T, Y decreases by $3.\n\nSimilarly, for a $1 decrease in T, Y increases by $3.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that increasing taxes by $1 decreases Y by $3, while decreasing G by $1 decreases Y by $4.\n\nSo, in this case, decreasing G has a larger impact on Y compared to increasing T.\n\nTherefore, option C (decreasing G by $100 million) would lead to a $400 million decrease in Y, while option D (increasing T by $100 million) would lead to a $300 million decrease in Y.\n\nTherefore, option C would cause a larger decrease in real GDP compared to option D.\n\nBut this contradicts my initial intuition that since consumer spending is a larger component, changes in taxes would have a larger impact.\n\nPerhaps the issue is that the government spending multiplier is larger than the tax multiplier in absolute terms.\n\nLet me verify the multipliers.\n\nGovernment spending multiplier: 1/(1 - MPC) = 4.\n\nTax multiplier: -MPC/(1 - MPC) = -0.75/0.25 = -3.\n\nSo, in terms of absolute impact per dollar change, decreasing G by $1 decreases Y by $4, while increasing T by $1 decreases Y by $3.\n\nTherefore, option C leads to a larger decrease in Y compared to option D.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's something missing here.\n\nLet me consider the balanced budget multiplier.\n\nThe balanced budget multiplier suggests that if the government increases both spending and taxes by the same amount, there is no net effect on aggregate demand.\n\nBut in option A, the government decreases spending and decreases taxes by the same amount.\n\nSo, if the government decreases spending by $100 million and decreases taxes by $100 million, what's the net effect?\n\nUsing the multipliers:\n\nDecrease in G: -4 * $100 million = - $400 million.\n\nDecrease in T: 3 * $100 million = + $300 million.\n\nNet change in Y: - $400 million + $300 million = - $100 million.\n\nSo, option A leads to a $100 million decrease in Y.\n\nOption B: increase G by $100 million \u2192 +4 * $100 million = + $400 million.\n\nOption C: decrease G by $100 million \u2192 -4 * $100 million = - $400 million.\n\nOption D: increase T by $100 million \u2192 -3 * $100 million = - $300 million.\n\nTherefore, option C leads to the largest decrease in Y, followed by option D, then option A, and option B leads to an increase.\n\nSo, the answer is option C: the government decreases spending with no change in taxes.\n\nWait, but the question says \"most likely to create the greatest decrease in real GDP.\"\n\nAccording to my calculations, option C leads to a $400 million decrease, option D to a $300 million decrease, option A to a $100 million decrease, and option B to a $400 million increase.\n\nTherefore, option C is the one that leads to the greatest decrease in real GDP.\n\nBut I thought earlier that consumer spending is a larger component, so changes in taxes might have a larger impact.\n\nHowever, based on the multipliers, decreasing G has a larger impact than increasing T.\n\nPerhaps the key is that the government spending multiplier is larger than the tax multiplier in absolute terms.\n\nTherefore, option C, which decreases G, leads to a larger decrease in Y compared to option D, which increases T.\n\nHence, the answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
