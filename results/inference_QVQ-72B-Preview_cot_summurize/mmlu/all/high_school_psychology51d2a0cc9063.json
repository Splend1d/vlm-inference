                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about Max, who has been having some behavior issues at preschool. The teachers have tried time-outs and other punishments, but nothing seems to be working. Now, his parents and the school have decided to take a different approach. They're going to give him a sticker every time he behaves well for a full hour. And once he collects ten stickers, he can give them to his parents, and they'll reward him with something. The question is asking what this method is called, and the options are negative reinforcement, a token economy, a point value system, or negative punishment.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with negative reinforcement: I remember that reinforcement is about increasing a behavior, and negative reinforcement involves removing an unpleasant stimulus to make a behavior more likely to happen again. For example, if someone is given a break from chores after doing something good, that's negative reinforcement because you're taking away something negative to encourage the good behavior.\n\nNext, negative punishment: This is the opposite of negative reinforcement. It involves taking away a positive stimulus to decrease a behavior. So, like, if someone loses a privilege because they misbehaved, that's negative punishment.\n\nNow, a token economy: I think this is a system where good behavior is rewarded with tokens or some kind of points, which can then be exchanged for actual rewards. It's like a behavior modification technique where you make abstract rewards tangible, and over time, the person learns to behave well without needing the tokens.\n\nA point value system sounds similar to a token economy, but maybe more specific to certain contexts, like classrooms or workplaces, where points are assigned for different tasks or behaviors and can be redeemed for prizes or privileges.\n\nSo, looking back at the scenario with Max, he gets a sticker for behaving well for an hour, and after collecting ten stickers, he gets a reward from his parents. This sounds a lot like a token economy. The stickers are like tokens that he earns for good behavior, and these tokens can be exchanged for a reward once he has enough.\n\nLet me see if this fits with the definition of a token economy. From what I recall, a token economy is a behavior modification system where desirable behavior is reinforced by giving tokens or points, which can then be exchanged for something valuable, like privileges or tangible rewards. It's based on the principle of operant conditioning, where behaviors are shaped by their consequences.\n\nIn this case, Max's good behavior (staying controlled for an hour) is being reinforced with a sticker, which is a token of sorts. Collecting ten stickers leads to a bigger reward from his parents. This seems to align perfectly with the concept of a token economy.\n\nLet me just double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nNegative reinforcement: Is the school removing something unpleasant when Max behaves well? Not really. They're adding a sticker, which is a positive thing, to encourage good behavior. So, this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nNegative punishment: Is there any removal of a positive stimulus here? No, they're actually adding something positive (a sticker) for good behavior. So, this doesn't match either.\n\nA point value system: This is similar to a token economy, but perhaps more generalized. In this context, since they're using stickers that can be exchanged for rewards, it's more specifically a token economy.\n\nWait a minute, maybe a point value system is another way of referring to a token economy. But I think token economy is the more precise term, especially in psychology and behavior modification.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, I would say that the method being used is a token economy.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the principles behind each option.\n\nNegative reinforcement: As I said earlier, it involves removing an unpleasant stimulus to increase a behavior. In this scenario, there's no removal of anything unpleasant; instead, they're adding a positive reward (sticker) for good behavior.\n\nNegative punishment: This would involve taking away something pleasant to decrease a behavior. Again, not applicable here since they're adding something positive for good behavior.\n\nA token economy: This fits perfectly because stickers are being used as tokens for good behavior, which can be exchanged for a larger reward.\n\nA point value system: While similar to a token economy, it might be considered more of a general concept. However, in educational and psychological literature, the term \"token economy\" is specifically used to describe systems where tokens (or points) are earned and exchanged for rewards.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is B. a token economy.\n\nI think that's the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
