                    "text": "So I have this problem here about finding the surface area of a right rectangular prism. The formula they gave me is S = 2(lw + wh + hl), where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height. I need to find the surface area in square inches for a prism that has a length of 12 inches, a width of 9 inches, and a height of 2 inches.\n\nFirst, I should probably plug in the values into the formula. So, l = 12, w = 9, and h = 2. Plugging these into the formula gives me:\n\nS = 2*(12*9 + 9*2 + 2*12)\n\nOkay, now I need to calculate the terms inside the parentheses. First, 12*9 is 108.\n\nThen, 9*2 is 18.\n\nAnd finally, 2*12 is 24.\n\nSo, adding those together: 108 + 18 + 24.\n\nLet's add 108 and 18 first. 108 plus 18 is 126.\n\nThen add 24 to that: 126 + 24 equals 150.\n\nNow, the formula has a 2 multiplied by this sum. So, S = 2*150.\n\n2 multiplied by 150 is 300.\n\nSo, the surface area should be 300 square inches.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 300\n\nB. 258\n\nC. 150\n\nD. 92\n\nIt seems like option A is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the formula: S = 2(lw + wh + hl)\n\nPlugging in l=12, w=9, h=2:\n\nS = 2*(12*9 + 9*2 + 2*12)\n\nCalculating each product:\n\n12*9 = 108\n\n9*2 = 18\n\n2*12 = 24\n\nAdding them up: 108 + 18 + 24 =\n\n108 + 18 = 126\n\n126 + 24 = 150\n\nThen, 2*150 = 300\n\nEverything checks out. The surface area is indeed 300 square inches.\n\nI think that's it. The answer should be A. 300.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 300} \\]"
