                    "text": "So I've got this sequence problem here. The first term is 1, and each successive term is the sum of all the previous terms. I need to find the first term that exceeds 5000. The options are 10240, 5001, 5002, and 8192.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the sequence. Let's list out the terms one by one to see the pattern.\n\nTerm 1: 1\n\nTerm 2: sum of previous terms = 1\n\nTerm 3: sum of previous terms = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nTerm 4: sum of previous terms = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4\n\nTerm 5: sum of previous terms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8\n\nTerm 6: sum of previous terms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 16\n\nTerm 7: sum of previous terms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 32\n\nTerm 8: sum of previous terms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 64\n\nTerm 9: sum of previous terms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 = 128\n\nTerm 10: sum of previous terms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 256\n\nTerm 11: sum of previous terms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 = 512\n\nTerm 12: sum of previous terms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 = 1024\n\nTerm 13: sum of previous terms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 + 1024 = 2048\n\nTerm 14: sum of previous terms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 + 1024 + 2048 = 4096\n\nTerm 15: sum of previous terms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 + 1024 + 2048 + 4096 = 8192\n\nTerm 16: sum of previous terms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 + 1024 + 2048 + 4096 + 8192 = 16384\n\nNow, looking at these terms:\n\nTerm 1: 1\n\nTerm 2: 1\n\nTerm 3: 2\n\nTerm 4: 4\n\nTerm 5: 8\n\nTerm 6: 16\n\nTerm 7: 32\n\nTerm 8: 64\n\nTerm 9: 128\n\nTerm 10: 256\n\nTerm 11: 512\n\nTerm 12: 1024\n\nTerm 13: 2048\n\nTerm 14: 4096\n\nTerm 15: 8192\n\nTerm 16: 16384\n\nI need to find the first term that exceeds 5000. Looking at term 14: 4096, which is less than 5000. Term 15: 8192, which is greater than 5000.\n\nSo, the first term that exceeds 5000 is 8192.\n\nWait a minute, but option A is 10240, which is term 16, but that's not the first term exceeding 5000. Option D is 8192, which matches term 15.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with term 1: 1\n\nTerm 2: 1 (sum of previous term 1)\n\nTerm 3: 1 + 1 = 2\n\nTerm 4: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4\n\nTerm 5: 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8\n\nTerm 6: 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 16\n\nAnd so on.\n\nYes, each term is double the previous term, starting from term 3.\n\nSo the sequence is: 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384,...\n\nThis is essentially a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 2.\n\nSo, the nth term can be expressed as:\n\nTerm n = 2^{n-2}, for n >= 2.\n\nBut term 1 is 1, which doesn't fit this pattern. Term 2 is also 1, which should be 2^{2-2} = 2^0 = 1, so the formula holds for n >= 2.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, term 1 is 1, term 2 is 1, term 3 is 2, term 4 is 4, etc.\n\nSo, term n = 2^{n-2} for n >= 2.\n\nBut term 1 is given as 1, which doesn't fit this pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to represent the sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the sequence is defined recursively.\n\nLet me define the sequence as a_n, where a_1 = 1, and for n >= 2, a_n = sum of all a_k for k from 1 to n-1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1\n\na_2 = a_1 = 1\n\na_3 = a_1 + a_2 = 2\n\na_4 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 4\n\na_5 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 8\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is indeed a geometric sequence where each term is double the previous term, starting from term 2.\n\nSo, a_n = 2^{n-2} for n >= 2, and a_1 = 1.\n\nNow, to find the smallest n such that a_n > 5000.\n\nFor n >= 2, a_n = 2^{n-2}\n\nSo, 2^{n-2} > 5000\n\nTaking logarithms, n - 2 > log2(5000)\n\nCalculating log2(5000):\n\n2^{12} = 4096\n\n2^{13} = 8192\n\nSo, 2^{12} = 4096 < 5000 < 8192 = 2^{13}\n\nWait, but in the inequality 2^{n-2} > 5000, we have:\n\nn - 2 > log2(5000)\n\nSince 2^{12} = 4096 < 5000 < 8192 = 2^{13}, then log2(5000) is between 12 and 13.\n\nTherefore, n - 2 >= 13\n\nSo, n >= 15\n\nThus, the smallest n for which a_n > 5000 is n = 15, with a_15 = 2^{13} = 8192.\n\nWhich corresponds to option D.\n\nBut wait, option A is 10240, which would be a_16 = 2^{14} = 16384, which is larger than 5000, but not the first term exceeding 5000.\n\nSimilarly, options B and C are 5001 and 5002, which are not in the sequence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option D, 8192.\n\nBut let me check again.\n\nLooking back at the sequence:\n\nTerm 11: 512\n\nTerm 12: 1024\n\nTerm 13: 2048\n\nTerm 14: 4096\n\nTerm 15: 8192\n\nTerm 16: 16384\n\nSo, term 15 is the first term exceeding 5000, which is 8192.\n\nHence, the answer is 8192.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8192} \\]"
