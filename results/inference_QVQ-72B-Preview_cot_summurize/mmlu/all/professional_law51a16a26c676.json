                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about a widget manufacturer and a retailer who've signed an agreement. The manufacturer is supposed to sell and the retailer to buy 10,000 widgets at $50 per 100. They're supposed to deliver 1,000 widgets each month for the next 10 months, and each monthly delivery is a separate contract. Payment should be made within 10 days of receiving each shipment.\n\nNow, the question is asking how best to interpret this agreement. The options are:\n\nA. a divisible contract.\n\nB. an installment contract.\n\nC. 10 separate contracts.\n\nD. a requirements-output contract.\n\nHmm, let's try to understand each type of contract.\n\nFirst, a divisible contract. From what I recall, a divisible contract is one where the obligations can be divided into separate parts, each of which can be enforced separately. So, if one part is breached, the rest can still be enforced. But in this case, the agreement seems to be for multiple deliveries over time, each treated separately. Maybe this fits, but let's see the others.\n\nNext, an installment contract. This sounds similar to a divisible contract but might have specific terms related to payments or deliveries in installments. Maybe this is applicable here since there are monthly deliveries and payments within 10 days of each shipment.\n\nOption C says it's 10 separate contracts. Each monthly delivery is a separate contract, according to the agreement. So, perhaps this is the most straightforward interpretation.\n\nLastly, a requirements-output contract. I think this is when the quantity to be supplied is based on the buyer's requirements or the seller's output capacity. In this agreement, it's a fixed quantity over a fixed period, so it doesn't seem to fit this description.\n\nLet me think again. The agreement states that each monthly delivery is a separate contract. So, that seems pretty clear that it's 10 separate contracts. But maybe there's more to it.\n\nIs there a difference between a divisible contract and multiple separate contracts? I think a divisible contract is more about the nature of the obligations being divisible, whereas separate contracts are distinct agreements each month.\n\nAn installment contract might involve multiple deliveries over time, with each delivery being part of a single overarching contract. But here, it's specified that each monthly delivery is a separate contract, which suggests that they are individual agreements rather than parts of a single contract.\n\nSo, perhaps option C is the correct answer: 10 separate contracts.\n\nBut let's double-check. If each delivery is a separate contract, that implies that each delivery has its own terms and conditions, and breaches in one delivery don't necessarily affect the others.\n\nPayment is to be made within 10 days of receipt of each shipment, which aligns with the idea that each delivery is its own agreement.\n\nI don't think it's a requirements-output contract because the quantity is fixed and not based on the retailer's requirements or the manufacturer's output.\n\nSo, between options A, B, and C, C seems the most appropriate.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider whether \"each monthly delivery is a separate contract\" means that each delivery is its own contract, or if it's a single contract with multiple deliverables.\n\nBut the wording suggests that each delivery is a separate contract, so I think it's 10 separate contracts.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 10 separate contracts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
