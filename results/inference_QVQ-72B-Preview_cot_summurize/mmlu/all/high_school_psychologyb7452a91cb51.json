                    "text": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this psychology question about defense mechanisms. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it.\n\nSo, the scenario is about Janice, who has been married for forty years. She feels hostile and contemptuous towards her husband but instead of showing those feelings, she overly dotes on him. And the question is asking which defense mechanism she's using from the given options: rational philosophy, reaction formation, repression, or sublimation.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a defense mechanism is. From what I recall, defense mechanisms are ways the mind protects itself from anxiety or uncomfortable thoughts and feelings. They're kind of like mental shortcuts that help us cope with stress or conflict without really dealing with the issue directly.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A is \"rational philosophy.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit off. I think rational philosophy is more about making decisions based on reason rather than emotion. But in this case, Janice is suppressing her true feelings and acting in a way that's not necessarily rational. Maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nOption B is \"reaction formation.\" I think reaction formation is when someone has an unacceptable feeling or desire and instead of expressing it, they go to the opposite extreme in their behavior. So, for example, if someone secretly hates someone but acts overly loving or kind to them, that might be reaction formation.\n\nIn Janice's case, she feels hostile and contemptuous but acts overly attentive and caring towards her husband. That sounds like she's expressing the opposite of what she's really feeling. So, this seems like a possible answer.\n\nOption C is \"repression.\" Repression is when unpleasant memories or feelings are pushed out of conscious awareness. It's like the mind buries them so you don't have to deal with them directly. However, in Janice's situation, she's not just not thinking about her feelings; she's actively behaving in a way that contradicts them by being extra nice to her husband. So, repression might not fully capture what's happening here.\n\nOption D is \"sublimation.\" Sublimation is when unacceptable impulses are channeled into more acceptable or productive activities. For example, if someone has aggressive tendencies, they might sublimate that energy into playing sports competitively. In Janice's case, she's channeling her negative feelings towards her husband into taking care of him. Is that sublimation?\n\nWell, maybe, but it seems a bit different. Sublimation is typically about transforming unhealthy impulses into positive actions, but in Janice's case, she's not necessarily transforming her feelings into positive actions; she's just masking them with overly attentive behavior.\n\nLet me think about this again. Reaction formation seems to fit best because she's expressing the opposite of her true feelings through her behavior. She feels hostile but acts overly loving. That's a clear case of reaction formation.\n\nRepression might be involved somewhere, like she's repressing her hostile feelings, but the main issue here is her behavior going to the opposite extreme, which is more indicative of reaction formation.\n\nRational philosophy doesn't seem relevant here because it's more about making logical choices rather than emotional ones, and in this scenario, Janice's behavior seems emotionally driven, not rational.\n\nSublimation involves channeling negative impulses into positive actions, and while Janice is directing her negative feelings towards taking care of her husband, it's not necessarily a productive or creative outlet in the same way that sublimation is often described.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I think the best answer is B. Reaction formation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
