                    "text": "Let's see what we've got here. So, there are 20 computers in the lab, but two of them don't work. That means there are only 18 computers that are functional. Mr. Cleary's class has 14 kids, and Ms. Ntuala's class has 12 kids. That's a total of 26 kids. Now, each computer can have at most two students using it. We need to figure out how many of these kids can have a computer to themselves, meaning only one kid per computer.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that all the kids have a computer to use. Since there are 26 kids and only 18 computers, it seems like there won't be enough computers for everyone. But wait, maybe not all kids need to use a computer at the same time, or maybe some computers can be shared. But the problem says every student must use a computer, and there can be at most two students per computer.\n\nSo, if we have 18 computers and each can have two students, that means a maximum of 36 student-computer sessions can be accommodated. But we only have 26 kids, so all of them can use a computer, but some computers might have only one student.\n\nThe question is asking for the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves. So, we want as many computers as possible to have only one student, and the rest to have two students.\n\nLet's think about it this way: let's say we have x computers with only one student each, and y computers with two students each. Then, the total number of students would be x + 2y, and the total number of computers used is x + y.\n\nWe know that x + y = 18 (since there are 18 working computers), and x + 2y = 26 (since there are 26 students).\n\nSo, we have the system of equations:\n\n1. x + y = 18\n\n2. x + 2y = 26\n\nWe can solve this system to find the values of x and y.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives:\n\n(x + 2y) - (x + y) = 26 - 18\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\ny = 8\n\nPlugging y back into the first equation:\n\nx + 8 = 18\n\nSo, x = 10\n\nThat means 10 computers have only one student each, and 8 computers have two students each.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves is 10.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 2\n\nB. 6\n\nC. 10\n\nD. 14\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 10.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure there aren't any mistakes here.\n\nFirst, total computers: 20 - 2 = 18 working computers.\n\nTotal students: 14 + 12 = 26.\n\nEach computer can have at most 2 students.\n\nWe want to maximize the number of students who have the computer to themselves, i.e., have only one student per computer.\n\nSo, if we have x computers with one student each and y computers with two students each, then:\n\nx + y = 18 (total computers)\n\nx + 2y = 26 (total students)\n\nSolving these:\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(x + 2y) - (x + y) = 26 - 18\n\nx + 2y - x - y = 8\n\nSo, y = 8\n\nThen, x = 18 - 8 = 10\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about it differently. If we want to maximize the number of students who have computers to themselves, we should minimize the number of students sharing computers. That is, we should have as many computers as possible with only one student, and the rest with two students.\n\nGiven that, if we assign one student to as many computers as possible, and the remaining students share the leftover computers, that would give us the maximum number of students with computers to themselves.\n\nSo, again, x computers with one student each, and y computers with two students each, with x + y = 18 and x + 2y = 26.\n\nSame as before, solving gives x = 10.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
