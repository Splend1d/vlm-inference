And the options are: A. impersonating Sinatra, B. talking to the cops, C. killing an enemy, or D. betting on horses.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First off, I know that in mobster circles, they have their own slang and ways of referring to certain activities or behaviors. So, \"singing like a canary\" must be some kind of metaphor or idiom used in that context.\n\nLet me think about what a canary represents. A canary is a bird that's known for its song, right? So, if someone is singing like a canary, it probably means they're talking a lot, maybe revealing information.\n\nNow, in the context of mobsters, who are often involved in criminal activities, the idea of someone talking about those activities is significant. Usually, mobsters are supposed to keep quiet about their dealings, especially to authorities. So, if someone is singing like a canary, they might be informing on their associates, maybe to the police.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Impersonating Sinatra: Frank Sinatra was a famous singer, so singing like a canary could be related to singing in general, but I don't see a direct connection to mobster lingo here. Although Sinatra had some ties to mobsters, I don't think this is the primary meaning.\n\nB. Talking to the cops: This seems plausible. If someone is revealing information to the police, they might be said to be singing like a canary, meaning they're talking freely and providing details about the operations or crimes.\n\nC. Killing an enemy: This doesn't seem to fit as directly. Killing someone might have other slang terms in mobster circles, like \"whacking\" or \"taking care of business.\" Singing like a canary seems more related to talking rather than killing.\n\nD. Betting on horses: This is about gambling, which is certainly part of mob activities, but again, singing like a canary doesn't directly relate to betting or gambling slang as far as I know.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option B. talking to the cops seems the most fitting answer. Singing like a canary would mean you're disclosing information to law enforcement, probably in exchange for some benefit or to avoid punishment.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider if there's any other context or possible interpretations. Maybe in some contexts, singing like a canary could mean bragging to your buddies or something like that, but that doesn't seem specifically tied to mobster lingo. It feels more like general slang.\n\nAlso, canaries were historically used in mines to detect toxic gases because they're sensitive to them. If a canary stopped singing, it was a warning of danger. But that doesn't directly relate to the idea of singing like a canary in mobster context.\n\nNo, I think the most straightforward and logical interpretation is that singing like a canary refers to informing on your associates to the police. So, my final answer is B. talking to the cops.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
