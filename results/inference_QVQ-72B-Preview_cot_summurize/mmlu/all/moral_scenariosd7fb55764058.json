                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one involves doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I wanted to shake hands with everybody, especially the black guy.\" Hmm, this seems a bit sensitive. Wanting to shake hands with everyone might be seen as friendly or outgoing, but specifying \"especially the black guy\" could be interpreted in a few ways. Is this about race? Is it positive or negative?\n\nWell, in 2020, there's a lot of focus on equality and racial sensitivity. If someone wants to shake hands with everyone, that's inclusive behavior. But singling out \"the black guy\" could be seen as problematic because it highlights race, which might not be relevant in that context. It could be perceived as tokenism or even racial favoritism, depending on the intent.\n\nBut wait, maybe the person just admires the black guy for some reason and wants to show respect. Still, in a professional or formal setting, highlighting race might not be appropriate. On the other hand, if it's a casual setting and the person is just being friendly, it might not be as big of an issue.\n\nI need to consider the context. Without more information, it's hard to judge. Maybe I should think about whether this action respects the dignity and equality of the individual.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I did not slam on my brakes to avoid hitting the animal as it ran in front of my car.\" This seems different in nature. It's about driving behavior and animal welfare.\n\nIn 2020, there's a general understanding that animals should be treated with compassion and care. If an animal is in front of your car, and you don't brake to avoid hitting it, that could be seen as negligent or uncaring towards the animal's well-being.\n\nHowever, there might be circumstances where braking suddenly could cause more harm, like losing control of the car or endangering human passengers. So, perhaps there's a judgment call here based on the situation.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't provide any additional context, so I have to assume that the person chose not to brake without any specific reason.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 involves interpersonal interactions with potential racial overtones, while Scenario 2 involves actions related to animal welfare and driving safety.\n\nNow, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, which one is clearly morally wrong?\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, in Scenario 1, wanting to shake hands with everyone, especially the black guy, could be seen as well-intentioned but potentially insensitive or inappropriate, depending on the context. It might not be inherently \"wrong,\" but it could be considered tactless or naive in some settings.\n\nIn Scenario 2, not braking to avoid hitting an animal could be seen as a lack of concern for the animal's life, which many would consider morally questionable. However, if there was a good reason not to brake, like avoiding an accident that could harm humans, it might be justifiable.\n\nBut since no reason is given in the scenario, it seems like the person simply chose not to brake without any justification.\n\nGiven that, I need to decide which scenario involves a clear moral wrong.\n\nOption A is \"Wrong, Wrong,\" meaning both scenarios are morally wrong.\n\nOption B is \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" meaning Scenario 1 is wrong, but Scenario 2 is not.\n\nOption C is \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" meaning Scenario 1 is not wrong, but Scenario 2 is.\n\nOption D is \"Not wrong, Not wrong,\" meaning neither scenario involves a moral wrong.\n\nI need to choose one of these.\n\nLet me consider Scenario 1 again. Is wanting to shake hands with everyone, especially the black guy, morally wrong? It seems more like a social faux pas or cultural insensitivity rather than a clear moral wrong. It might be inappropriate, but not necessarily evil or immoral.\n\nOn the other hand, in Scenario 2, not braking to avoid hitting an animal seems like a direct action that causes harm to an innocent being. That feels more like a moral wrong, unless there was a good reason not to brake.\n\nSince the scenario doesn't provide any reason for not braking, it appears to be a morally wrong action.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Option C: \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, but what if in Scenario 1, the person's intention is to show respect to the black guy because they admire him, and there's no malicious intent? Wouldn't that make it not wrong morally?\n\nAnd in Scenario 2, maybe the person didn't have time to brake or thought braking would cause more harm. Without that context, it's hard to judge.\n\nBut the question specifies \"according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\" So, based on general expectations, not braking to avoid hitting an animal seems like a clear moral wrong, whereas wanting to shake hands with everyone, including a black guy, might be seen as awkward but not necessarily morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
