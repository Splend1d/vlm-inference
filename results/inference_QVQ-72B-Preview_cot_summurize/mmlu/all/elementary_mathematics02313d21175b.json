                    "text": "So Rosa has this goal of running 100 miles in a month. That's pretty impressive! She runs 5 miles every day she runs. The question is asking for an expression that she could use to figure out how many miles she has left to run after running for d days.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what d represents here. It says \"after running for d days.\" So d is the number of days she has already run.\n\nIf she runs 5 miles each day she runs, then the total miles she has already run would be 5 times d, right? So that's 5d.\n\nNow, her total goal is 100 miles. So, the miles left would be the total goal minus the miles she has already run.\n\nSo, miles left = total goal - miles already run.\n\nPlugging in the numbers, that would be miles left = 100 - 5d.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 100 - 5d\n\nB. 5d + 100\n\nC. 100 / 5d\n\nD. 5d\n\nSo, option A matches what I just calculated.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nOption B is 5d + 100. That would actually give you the total miles she would have run if she ran for d days, plus 100. But we're supposed to find the miles left after she has already run for d days. So, that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C is 100 / 5d. That would be the total goal divided by the miles she ran in d days. That doesn't seem to represent the miles left.\n\nOption D is just 5d, which is the miles she runs in d days. That's not the miles left; that's the miles she has already run.\n\nSo, yeah, option A seems to be the correct expression.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if she runs every day or if there are days she doesn't run. The problem says \"each day that she ran, she ran 5 miles.\" So, d represents the number of days she actually ran, assuming she only runs on those days.\n\nBut the question specifies \"after running for d days,\" so d is the number of days she has run, each day running 5 miles.\n\nSo, yes, total miles run is 5d, and miles left is 100 - 5d.\n\nI think option A is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider an example. Suppose d = 10 days.\n\nThen, miles run = 5 * 10 = 50 miles.\n\nMiles left = 100 - 50 = 50 miles.\n\nIf we plug d=10 into option A: 100 - 5*10 = 50, which matches.\n\nOption B: 5*10 + 100 = 150, which doesn't make sense because she can't have more than 100 miles left.\n\nOption C: 100 / (5*10) = 100/50 = 2, which also doesn't make sense.\n\nOption D: 5*10 = 50, which is the miles she has already run, not the miles left.\n\nTherefore, option A is indeed the correct expression.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
