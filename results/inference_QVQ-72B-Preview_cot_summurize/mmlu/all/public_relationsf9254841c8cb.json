                    "text": "So I have this question here about advertising campaigns, and it's asking which type is focused on gathering support for a particular message or cause. The options are product-oriented, person-oriented, idea-oriented, and message-oriented. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what each type of advertising campaign is typically focused on.\n\nStarting with product-oriented campaigns: these are probably aimed at promoting specific products, right? Like, convincing consumers to buy a particular brand of soda or a new smartphone. So, the focus is on the features, benefits, and value of the product. But the question is about gathering support for a message or cause, which sounds more abstract than just selling a product. So, maybe this isn't the best fit.\n\nNext, person-oriented campaigns. This sounds like it's about promoting an individual, perhaps a celebrity or a political figure. These campaigns might aim to build a personal brand, increase popularity, or influence public perception. Again, while they might involve messages or ideas, the primary focus is on the person. But the question specifies a \"particular message or cause,\" which seems more general than just supporting an individual. So, maybe not this one either.\n\nNow, idea-oriented campaigns. This seems promising. It suggests that the campaign is centered around a particular idea or concept, such as environmental conservation, equal rights, or healthy living. These campaigns are likely designed to change attitudes, raise awareness, or encourage actions that align with the idea being promoted. Supporting a message or cause fits well with this description, as it's about advocating for a specific belief or initiative.\n\nLastly, message-oriented campaigns. This seems similar to idea-oriented, but perhaps more focused on the communication of a specific message. It could be part of a larger campaign to support a cause or an idea. However, the term \"message-oriented\" might also imply a focus on the way the message is conveyed, such as through particular slogans or key phrases, rather than the underlying cause itself.\n\nConsidering all this, I think idea-oriented campaigns are the most fitting answer. They are directly aimed at gathering support for a specific idea or cause, which matches the description in the question.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there a difference between idea-oriented and message-oriented that I might be missing? Maybe message-oriented campaigns are more about the strategy and wording of the communication, whereas idea-oriented campaigns are about the broader concept or cause they're supporting.\n\nIf that's the case, then idea-oriented would still seem to be the better choice for gathering support for a particular message or cause, since it's about the cause itself rather than the way it's communicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps message-oriented campaigns are specifically focused on spreading a particular message to support a cause, and the emphasis is on the message as the central element.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Maybe I should look at it differently. Let's consider the context of advertising campaigns in general.\n\nAdvertising campaigns can be categorized in various ways, such as promotional, informational, persuasive, etc. But in this question, it's specifically about the focus of the campaign: product, person, idea, or message.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options provided, idea-oriented seems to align best with campaigns that aim to gather support for a particular message or cause. These campaigns are not selling a product or promoting a specific person; instead, they're advocating for a specific idea or cause.\n\nFor example, a campaign to raise awareness about climate change would be idea-oriented, focusing on the cause of environmental protection and sustainable practices. Similarly, a campaign promoting vaccination would be centered around the idea of public health and disease prevention.\n\nOn the other hand, a message-oriented campaign might be more about the communication strategy, ensuring that the message is clear, compelling, and reaches the target audience effectively. While messages are important in all types of campaigns, the primary goal here seems to be supporting a cause, not just crafting a message.\n\nTherefore, idea-oriented campaigns are the most appropriate choice for gathering support for a particular message or cause.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any overlap or if another option could also fit.\n\nFor instance, could a product-oriented campaign also be about supporting a cause? Sometimes, yes\u2014companies may tie their products to charitable causes, where a portion of sales goes to support a specific initiative. However, the primary focus remains the product, not the cause itself. So, while there might be some alignment, the main objective is still to sell the product.\n\nSimilarly, person-oriented campaigns might involve individuals who advocate for causes, like celebrities endorsing environmental initiatives. But again, the focus is on the person and their brand, not solely on the cause.\n\nThus, neither product-oriented nor person-oriented campaigns are primarily focused on supporting a particular message or cause in the same way that idea-oriented campaigns are.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. Idea-oriented.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
