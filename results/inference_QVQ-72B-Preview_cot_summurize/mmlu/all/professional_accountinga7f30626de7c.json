                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what a practitioner should do as part of an engagement for agreed-upon procedures under Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements. I've got four options here, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think through each one.\n\nOption A says, \"Issue a report on findings based on specified procedures performed.\" Hmm, that sounds reasonable. In an agreed-upon procedures engagement, the practitioner is usually engaged to perform specific procedures that the parties have agreed upon. So, after performing those procedures, it makes sense that they would issue a report on what they found.\n\nOption B is, \"Assess whether the procedures meet the needs of the parties.\" Well, I think that's something that should happen before the engagement starts. Like, when the parties are agreeing on the procedures, the practitioner should make sure that these procedures are appropriate for the objectives of the engagement. But in the actual engagement process, is that still part of it? Maybe not directly.\n\nOption C says, \"Express negative assurance on findings of work performed.\" Negative assurance is when the practitioner says that nothing came to their attention that causes them to believe that the subject matter is not in accordance with the criteria. But in an agreed-upon procedures engagement, it's more about performing specific procedures and reporting the facts found, not providing any assurance, positive or negative. So, this might not be right.\n\nOption D is, \"Report the differences between agreed-upon and audit procedures.\" This seems a bit confusing. In an agreed-upon procedures engagement, you're performing specific procedures that are agreed upon by the parties involved. Audit procedures are different; they're part of a full audit. So, maybe there's a need to report differences if someone wants to know how an agreed-upon procedures engagement differs from an audit, but that doesn't sound like something that's part of the actual engagement itself.\n\nLet me see. I think Option A is the most straightforward. The practitioner performs the agreed-upon procedures and then issues a report on what they found. That aligns with what I remember about agreed-upon procedures engagements.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me double-check. According to Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE), in an agreed-upon procedures engagement, the practitioner is engaged to apply specific procedures to subject matter and to report his or her findings. There's no requirement to provide assurance, either positive or negative, on the subject matter. So, expressing negative assurance (Option C) would be incorrect.\n\nOption B, assessing whether the procedures meet the needs of the parties, seems more like part of the planning phase or the initial engagement discussion, not necessarily part of the execution of the engagement.\n\nOption D suggests reporting differences between agreed-upon procedures and audit procedures. While there might be some educational value in that, it's not typically part of the engagement deliverables. The focus is on performing and reporting the agreed-upon procedures.\n\nSo, after considering all options, I believe the correct answer is Option A: issue a report on findings based on specified procedures performed.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any requirement in SSAE to assess whether the procedures meet the needs of the parties during the engagement. Let me think about it. SSAE does require the practitioner to understand the objectives of the engagement and to agree upon the procedures that are necessary to achieve those objectives. So, in that sense, assessing whether the procedures meet the needs of the parties is part of the engagement process, but more so in the planning phase rather than the execution phase.\n\nIn the execution phase, the practitioner is supposed to perform the procedures as agreed and report the findings. So, again, pointing back to Option A.\n\nI think I'm confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
