                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about equilibrium in a perfectly competitive market for good X. There are four options, and I need to pick the one that's true. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what equilibrium means in economics. I think equilibrium is when the market is balanced, right? So, in a competitive market, equilibrium happens where supply equals demand. That sounds familiar.\n\nOption B says the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied of good X. That seems to match my understanding of equilibrium. So, maybe that's the correct answer.\n\nBut let's check the other options to be sure. Option A says there's a shortage of good X. A shortage usually happens when quantity demanded is greater than quantity supplied. So, if we're at equilibrium, where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied, there shouldn't be a shortage. So, option A probably isn't true.\n\nOption C says there's a surplus of good X. A surplus is when quantity supplied is greater than quantity demanded. Again, at equilibrium, these should be equal, so there shouldn't be a surplus either. So, option C seems incorrect.\n\nOption D says the government regulates the quantity of good X produced at the market price. In a perfectly competitive market, ideally, there's minimal government intervention. The market is supposed to regulate itself through the interaction of supply and demand. So, if the government is regulating the quantity, that sounds more like a controlled economy rather than a perfectly competitive one. So, option D is likely not true.\n\nTherefore, by process of elimination, option B seems to be the correct answer. But just to make sure, maybe I should think about it differently.\n\nLet me recall the definition of a perfectly competitive market. It's a market with many buyers and sellers, all dealing in identical products, and no single buyer or seller can influence the market price. In such a market, the equilibrium price and quantity are determined where the supply curve intersects the demand curve.\n\nAt this equilibrium point, the quantity demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers. So, again, that points to option B being correct.\n\nIs there any chance that at equilibrium, there could be a shortage or surplus? Well, no, because by definition, equilibrium is when supply and demand are balanced. So, options A and C should be incorrect.\n\nWhat about option D? Could the government regulate production in a perfectly competitive market? While in reality, some governments do intervene in markets labeled as competitive, theoretically, in a purely competitive market, government intervention is minimal or non-existent. So, option D is unlikely to be true in this context.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that option B is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any possibility of external factors affecting the market. For example, if there are changes in production costs or consumer preferences, that could shift the supply or demand curves, but the question seems to be referring to the equilibrium in a stable market without such changes.\n\nAssuming that the market is in equilibrium without any external shocks, then yes, quantity demanded equals quantity supplied.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that at equilibrium, there's no pressure for the price to change. If there were a shortage or surplus, that would put upward or downward pressure on the price, respectively, until equilibrium is reached.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the true statement about equilibrium in a perfectly competitive market for good X is that the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied of good X.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
