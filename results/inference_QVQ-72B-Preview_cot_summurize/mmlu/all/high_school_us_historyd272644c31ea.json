I answer: Out of local conditions and the necessities of the case methods of government will grow. If England can govern foreign lands, so can America. If Germany can govern foreign lands, so can America. If they can supervise protectorates, so can America. Why is it more difficult to administer Hawaii than New Mexico or California? Both had a savage and an alien population; both were more remote from the seat of government when they came under our dominion than the Philippines are to-day.\nWill you say by your vote that American ability to govern has decayed; that a century's experience in self-rule has failed of a result? Will you affirm by your vote that you are an infidel to American power and practical sense? Or will you say that ours is the blood of government; ours the heart of dominion; ours the brain and genius of administration?

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about Albert Beveridge's speech titled \"The March of the Flag,\" which he gave in Indianapolis on September 16, 1898. The question is asking what his speech was a response to, and the options are:\n\nA. The purchase of Alaska\n\nB. The Mexican War\n\nC. The Spanish\u2013American War\n\nD. World War I\n\nFirst off, I need to understand the context of the speech. The date is important: September 16, 1898. That was a time when the United States was actively expanding its influence and territory, particularly in the wake of the Spanish\u2013American War.\n\nLet me recall what happened in the Spanish\u2013American War. It was fought in 1898 between the United States and Spain, primarily over Cuba and Puerto Rico. The war resulted in a decisive American victory, and as a result, Spain ceded several territories to the U.S., including Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.\n\nNow, Beveridge's speech seems to be about the United States' role in governing these new possessions. He mentions places like Hawaii, New Mexico, California, and the Philippines, which were all areas that had recently come under U.S. control or were being considered for annexation.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: The purchase of Alaska.\n\nAlaska was purchased from Russia in 1867, which is quite a bit earlier than 1898. Given the date of the speech, it seems unlikely that Beveridge was responding directly to the purchase of Alaska, as that had happened thirty-one years prior.\n\nOption B: The Mexican War.\n\nThe Mexican War took place from 1846 to 1848, resulting in the U.S. acquiring vast territories that now include California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and parts of New Mexico and Wyoming. Again, this was several decades before 1898. While the governance of these areas might still be a topic of discussion, the timing doesn't align closely with the date of the speech.\n\nOption C: The Spanish\u2013American War.\n\nThis seems the most plausible. The Spanish\u2013American War concluded with the Treaty of Paris in December 1898, just a few months after Beveridge's speech. The treaty formalized the transfer of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States. Given that, Beveridge's discussion about governing new possessions aligns perfectly with the recent acquisitions resulting from the war.\n\nOption D: World War I.\n\nWorld War I began in 1914 and ended in 1918, which is more than a decade after Beveridge's speech. The U.S. entered the war in 1917, so it doesn't make sense that his 1898 speech would be responding to World War I.\n\nAdditionally, considering the content of the speech excerpt provided, Beveridge is addressing concerns about the United States' ability to govern these new territories. He compares America's capabilities to those of England and Germany, both of which had extensive colonial empires at the time. He also draws parallels to the incorporation of previously acquired territories like Hawaii, New Mexico, and California.\n\nMoreover, the phrase \"pitch the tents of liberty farther westward, farther southward\" suggests a continuation of the manifest destiny ideology that drove American expansion in the 19th century and into the early 20th century.\n\nGiven all this, it's clear that Beveridge's speech was a response to the Spanish\u2013American War and the debates surrounding the United States' new status as a global imperial power with responsibilities in governing overseas territories.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. The Spanish\u2013American War.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
