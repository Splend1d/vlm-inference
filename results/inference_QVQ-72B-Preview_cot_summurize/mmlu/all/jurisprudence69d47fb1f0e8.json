I'm not entirely sure about this, but I think it might be Salmond. Let me see if I can recall correctly.\n\nI remember that John Austin was known for his work on legal positivism and the command theory of law. He emphasized the importance of the sovereign and the idea that laws are commands backed by sanctions. But I don't recall him specifically discussing the distinction between general and particular jurisprudence.\n\nHolland, I think, was also a legal theorist, but I'm a bit fuzzy on his contributions. Wasn't he more involved with English law and legal history? Maybe I'm confusing him with someone else. Anyway, I don't remember him making this particular distinction in jurisprudence.\n\nThen there's Kelsen, who is famous for his pure theory of law and the concept of the Grundnorm. His work seems more focused on the structure and hierarchy of legal norms rather than distinguishing between general and particular aspects of jurisprudence.\n\nThat leaves Salmond. I have a vague recollection that Salmond discussed different types of jurisprudence, including general and particular. He might have been the one to categorize jurisprudence in this way. Let me try to think back to his definitions or classifications.\n\nSalmond, in his book \"Jurisprudence,\" which I believe was first published in the early 20th century, discussed the scope and nature of jurisprudence. He might have divided jurisprudence into general and particular branches. General jurisprudence would deal with legal principles and concepts applicable to all legal systems, whereas particular jurisprudence would focus on specific areas of law or particular legal systems.\n\nYeah, that sounds familiar. So, if that's the case, then Salmond would be the correct answer. But just to be sure, let me consider if any of the other scholars might have also made this distinction.\n\nAustin, as I mentioned earlier, was more concerned with the nature of law and sovereignty, not necessarily with classifying jurisprudence into general and particular.\n\nHolland, I think, was more involved with the study of English law and maybe some legal history, but again, not directly with this specific distinction in jurisprudence.\n\nKelsen's work is more about the formal structure of law and the idea of a normative system, which doesn't directly align with distinguishing between general and particular jurisprudence.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I think the best answer is B. Salmond.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
