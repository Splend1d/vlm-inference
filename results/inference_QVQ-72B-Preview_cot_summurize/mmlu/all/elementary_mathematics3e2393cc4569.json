                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem here about Mr. Clark's fourth-grade class. There are 20 students in his class, and the entire fourth grade has 5 times as many students as there are in his class. I need to find out which equation to use to find the number of students, n, in the entire fourth grade.\n\nOkay, so first things first, I know that Mr. Clark's class has 20 students. And the entire fourth grade has 5 times as many students as his class. So, if his class has 20 students, then the whole fourth grade should have 20 multiplied by 5, right? Let me calculate that to understand better.\n\n20 times 5 is 100. So, there should be 100 students in the entire fourth grade.\n\nNow, I need to look at the options given and see which equation will give me n = 100.\n\nOption A says 5 times n equals 20. So, if I solve for n, I'd divide both sides by 5, which gives n = 20/5, which is 4. That doesn't match my earlier calculation of 100. So, option A is probably not correct.\n\nOption B says 5 plus 20 equals n. So, that would be 25. But earlier, I calculated that there should be 100 students. So, 25 doesn't match 100. Maybe this isn't the right equation.\n\nOption C says 20 times 5 equals n. That's exactly what I did earlier. 20 times 5 is 100, which matches my initial calculation. So, this seems promising.\n\nOption D says 20 divided by n equals 5. So, if I solve for n, I'd divide both sides by 5 and then multiply by n, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me try plugging in the numbers. If n is 100, then 20 divided by 100 equals 0.2, which is not equal to 5. Hmm, that doesn't match. So, maybe option D isn't correct.\n\nSo, based on my calculations, option C seems to be the correct equation. But just to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nIf n = 20 times 5, that's 100, which makes sense because if Mr. Clark's class has 20 students and the entire grade has 5 times as many, then 20 times 5 is indeed 100.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if there are other factors involved, but the problem seems straightforward. No other information is provided, so I think the answer is simply 20 times 5 equals n.\n\nAlright, I'm confident that option C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
