                    "text": "Let's see. So, Grady rides his bike 60% faster than his little brother Noah. And in two hours, Grady rides 12 miles further than Noah. I need to find out how fast Noah rides in miles per hour. The options are 32, 20, 10, and 7.2 mph.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means that Grady rides 60% faster than Noah. Does that mean his speed is 100% + 60% of Noah's speed? So, if Noah's speed is, say, x mph, then Grady's speed would be x plus 60% of x. Let me calculate that.\n\n60% of x is 0.6x. So, Grady's speed would be x + 0.6x = 1.6x mph.\n\nAlright, now I know their speeds in terms of x.\n\nNext, they ride for two hours, and Grady rides 12 miles further than Noah in that time.\n\nDistance is speed multiplied by time. So, for Noah, distance would be x mph times 2 hours, which is 2x miles.\n\nFor Grady, distance would be 1.6x mph times 2 hours, which is 3.2x miles.\n\nAccording to the problem, Grady rides 12 miles further than Noah. So, Grady's distance minus Noah's distance equals 12 miles.\n\nThat is, 3.2x - 2x = 12.\n\nSo, 1.2x = 12.\n\nNow, I can solve for x by dividing both sides by 1.2.\n\nx = 12 / 1.2\n\nx = 10 mph.\n\nSo, Noah rides at 10 miles per hour.\n\nLet me just check if that makes sense.\n\nIf Noah rides at 10 mph for 2 hours, he would ride 20 miles.\n\nGrady rides 60% faster, so his speed is 10 + 60% of 10, which is 10 + 6 = 16 mph.\n\nIn 2 hours, Grady would ride 32 miles.\n\nIs 32 miles 12 miles further than Noah's 20 miles? Yes, exactly.\n\nSo, it checks out.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 10 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
