                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about an accountant reviewing financial statements for an entity, and it says that the entity is using a \"comprehensive basis of accounting other than generally accepted accounting principles\" or GAAP. I need to figure out what the accountant should do in this situation from the options given.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what it means to maintain accounts on a comprehensive basis other than GAAP. GAAP is the standard set of principles and rules for financial accounting and reporting in the United States. It's what most companies use to ensure their financial statements are comparable and reliable. But sometimes, entities might use another basis of accounting for various reasons, like tax basis, cash basis, or some other special purpose basis.\n\nThe term \"comprehensive basis\" suggests that the entity has a systematic and consistent approach to accounting, but it's not following GAAP. So, it's not just random accounting methods; it's a thought-out system that's different from GAAP.\n\nNow, the accountant is supposed to review these financial statements in accordance with Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARS). SSARS provides guidance on how to perform review engagements, which are less intensive than audits but still require the accountant to apply certain procedures and express a conclusion about whether the financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects.\n\nGiven that the entity is not using GAAP, the accountant needs to consider how to handle this deviation in the review engagement. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Withdrawn from the engagement because the entity has not been following GAAP.\n\nIs this the right course of action? Well, just because an entity isn't using GAAP doesn't necessarily mean the accountant has to withdraw. There are legitimate reasons why an entity might use a different basis of accounting, especially if it's a small business or if there are specific industry practices. The accountant might still be able to review the financial statements as long as they disclose the different basis being used.\n\nB. Advised management to make the adjustments necessary for the account balances to conform with GAAP.\n\nThis seems like a possibility. Maybe the accountant thinks that the financial statements should be on a GAAP basis and is suggesting changes to align with GAAP. However, in a review engagement, the accountant isn't required to prepare the financial statements or make adjustments; that's typically the responsibility of management. The accountant can offer advice, but it's up to management to decide whether to make those adjustments.\n\nC. Modified the review report to reflect the fact that the financial statements were presented on another comprehensive basis of accounting.\n\nThis seems like a plausible option. If the entity is using a different basis of accounting that's comprehensive and consistent, the accountant can still perform a review engagement but needs to modify the report to disclose that the financial statements are not prepared in accordance with GAAP. This would help users of the financial statements understand the basis on which the numbers are presented.\n\nD. Requested that management justify the use of the other comprehensive basis of accounting in the management representation letter.\n\nThis option suggests that the accountant wants management to explain or justify why they're using this different basis of accounting in their representation letter. A management representation letter is a document where management confirms certain information and makes representations about the financial statements. Including a justification for using a different basis could be relevant, but it might not be the primary action the accountant needs to take in this situation.\n\nConsidering these options, I think the most appropriate action is to modify the review report to reflect that the financial statements are presented on another comprehensive basis of accounting. This aligns with SSARS requirements to describe the basis of accounting used if it's not GAAP.\n\nLet me double-check this. If the entity is using a different basis of accounting, and it's a comprehensive one, the accountant can still perform a review engagement but must ensure that the basis is clearly disclosed in the financial statements and in the review report. Modifying the report to include this disclosure would be a standard practice in such cases.\n\nOption A, withdrawing from the engagement, seems too drastic unless there are specific reasons why the different basis is not acceptable or if the accountant feels unable to perform the review under those circumstances.\n\nOption B, advising management to make adjustments to conform with GAAP, might be a piece of advice the accountant gives, but it's not necessarily the primary action required in the review engagement. The review is based on the financial statements as presented, and if they're on a different basis, the report should reflect that.\n\nOption D, requesting management to justify the use of another basis in the representation letter, might be something the accountant does, but it's more of an additional step rather than the main action needed to address the situation in the review report.\n\nTherefore, I believe that modifying the review report to reflect the use of another comprehensive basis of accounting is the most appropriate action for the accountant to take in this scenario.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
