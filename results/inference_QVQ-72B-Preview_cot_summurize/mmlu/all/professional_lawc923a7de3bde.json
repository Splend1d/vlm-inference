                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out if these graphs are admissible in court. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nThere's a plaintiff who's suing the defendant over the title to some land on a riverbank. The water level changes over time are really important to the plaintiff's case. For 15 years, a commercial fisherman has been keeping a daily log of the water level at his dock, which is on the opposite side of the river from the disputed land. He did this to predict fishing conditions. The plaintiff hired a draftsman to turn these logs into graphs to use as evidence in the trial.\n\nAt the trial, the fisherman testified about how carefully he measured and recorded the water levels in his logs, and these logs were made available for the defendant to inspect. Then, the draftsman explained how he prepared the graphs from the fisherman's logs. With this foundation, the question is whether these graphs can be admitted as evidence.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. No, because they are hearsay not within any exception.\n\nB. No, because they violate the \"best evidence\" rule.\n\nC. Yes, as summaries of voluminous business records.\n\nD. Yes, as the draftsman's expert opinion of the water levels.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, what is hearsay? Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. But in this case, the graphs are based on the fisherman's logs, which were made as part of his business practice. Business records can be an exception to the hearsay rule under certain conditions.\n\nThe business records exception allows for the admission of records made in the regular course of business, provided they were made at or near the time of the events they record and by someone with knowledge of those events. The fisherman's logs seem to fit this description since he was keeping daily records of water levels for his fishing business.\n\nMoreover, the fisherman has testified about the care with which he made and recorded these measurements, which adds to the reliability of the records.\n\nNow, the graphs were prepared by a draftsman from these logs. So, the graphs are a visual representation of the data in the logs. In legal terms, these graphs would be considered summaries of the underlying records.\n\nThe Federal Rules of Evidence, particularly Rule 1006, allow for the use of charts, tables, or calculations to summarize voluminous records when the original records are admissible but would be cumbersome to review in their entirety. This seems to be the case here, as 15 years of daily logs would be quite extensive.\n\nTo admit such summaries, the original records must be available for inspection by the opposing party, which they were in this scenario. Also, the person who prepared the summary (the draftsman) should be available to testify about how the summary was prepared, which he did.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like the graphs should be admissible as summaries of voluminous business records.\n\nBut let's consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A says no because they are hearsay not within any exception. But as I thought earlier, the business records exception applies here, so this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B says no because they violate the \"best evidence\" rule. The best evidence rule generally requires that the original document be produced when its contents are in question. However, in this case, the original logs are available, and the graphs are summaries intended to make the data more manageable. Rule 1006 specifically allows for such summaries, so long as the originals are available for inspection, which they are. Therefore, this doesn't seem to be a violation of the best evidence rule.\n\nOption C says yes, as summaries of voluminous business records. This aligns with my earlier thinking. The logs are business records, and the graphs are summaries of those records, which are admissible under Rule 1006.\n\nOption D says yes, as the draftsman's expert opinion of the water levels. Hmm, I'm not so sure about this. The draftsman is creating graphs based on the data provided by the fisherman's logs. He's not an expert on water levels; he's just visualizing the data. His testimony isn't about interpreting the data but about how he prepared the graphs. So, I don't think this is the right classification for the graphs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Yes, as summaries of voluminous business records.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if there's any other angle that might make the graphs inadmissible. For instance, is there any potential for bias or lack of authenticity in the graphs? Well, the draftsman testified to the manner in which he prepared the graphs, which suggests that the process was straightforward and based on the data in the logs. There's no indication of manipulation or misrepresentation.\n\nAlso, the fisherman's logs were made available for inspection by the defendant, so they had the opportunity to review the original records and challenge them if necessary. Since no challenge is mentioned, it's reasonable to assume that the logs are accepted as accurate for the purposes of this discussion.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the graphs are admissible as summaries of voluminous business records.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
