                    "text": "Let's tackle this partnership tax problem. So, Gulde has a tax basis in Chyme Partnership of $26,000. Then, Gulde receives a liquidating distribution consisting of $12,000 cash and land with an adjusted basis to Chyme of $10,000 and a fair market value of $30,000. The question is, what is Gulde's basis in the land received?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what happens when a partner receives a liquidating distribution from a partnership. Generally, when a partner receives a distribution in liquidation of their interest, the basis of the property received is determined based on the partner's basis in the partnership interest before the distribution, adjusted for any gain or loss recognized on the distribution.\n\nLet me recall the general rules for liquidating distributions:\n\n1. **Cash Distribution:** If the distribution includes cash, it reduces the partner's basis in the partnership interest.\n\n2. **Property Distribution:** The basis of the property received is usually the partnership's adjusted basis in the property, increased by any boot (cash or other property) received, minus the partner's basis in the partnership interest.\n\nBut I need to be careful here. The problem mentions that Chyme did not have unrealized receivables, appreciated inventory, or properties that had been contributed by its partners. These are important because they can affect the treatment of the distribution.\n\nLet me consider the steps to calculate Gulde's basis in the land:\n\n1. **Determine the Amount Realized:** This is the sum of the cash and the fair market value of the property received.\n\n   Cash: $12,000\n\n   Fair Market Value of Land: $30,000\n\n   Total Amount Realized: $12,000 + $30,000 = $42,000\n\n2. **Compare to Gulde's Basis in the Partnership Interest:** Gulde's basis was $26,000.\n\n3. **Calculate Gain or Loss:**\n\n   Amount Realized: $42,000\n\n   Basis in Partnership: $26,000\n\n   Gain: $42,000 - $26,000 = $16,000\n\n   So, Gulde has a recognized gain of $16,000 on the distribution.\n\n4. **Determine the Basis of the Property Received:**\n\n   Generally, the basis of property received in a liquidating distribution is the partnership's adjusted basis in the property, increased by any gain recognized by the partner.\n\n   Partnership's adjusted basis in the land: $10,000\n\n   Gain recognized by Gulde: $16,000\n\n   Gulde's Basis in the Land: $10,000 + $16,000 = $26,000\n\n   But wait, that's not one of the options. The options are $0, $10,000, $14,000, and $30,000.\n\n   Maybe I'm missing something.\n\n   \n   Let me check another approach. Perhaps I need to allocate the basis between the cash and the property.\n\n5. **Alternative Approach: Allocate Basis Between Cash and Property:**\n\n   Gulde's basis in the partnership was $26,000.\n\n   He received $12,000 cash, which reduces his basis to $26,000 - $12,000 = $14,000.\n\n   Then, he receives land with the partnership's basis of $10,000.\n\n   Normally, the basis of the property received is the lesser of:\n\n   - The partnership's basis in the property ($10,000), or\n\n   - The partner's basis in the partnership interest reduced by any cash received ($26,000 - $12,000 = $14,000)\n\n   So, the basis of the land would be $10,000.\n\n   But that's option B, which seems plausible, but I thought earlier that gain might be added.\n\n6. **Consider Gain Recognition:**\n\n   Gulde recognized a gain of $16,000. Typically, in a liquidating distribution, any gain recognized is treated as a capital gain, but it doesn't directly increase the basis of the property received.\n\n   However, sometimes, the gain recognized can affect the basis of the property received, especially if the distribution includes both cash and property.\n\n7. **Another Reference:**\n\n   According to IRS regulations, the basis of property received in a liquidating distribution is generally the partnership's adjusted basis in the property, increased by any money distributed in the same distribution, but not exceeding the partner's adjusted basis in the partnership interest.\n\n   So, basis of land = partnership's basis in land + cash received, but not more than partner's basis in partnership.\n\n   Here, partnership's basis in land: $10,000\n\n   Cash received: $12,000\n\n   Partner's basis in partnership: $26,000\n\n   So, $10,000 + $12,000 = $22,000, which is less than $26,000.\n\n   But this still doesn't match the options.\n\n8. **Gain Recognition and Basis Adjustment:**\n\n   Perhaps the gain recognized needs to be considered separately. The gain is recognized because the amount realized exceeds the partner's basis in the partnership interest.\n\n   The gain is taxable income to Gulde, but it doesn't directly increase the basis of the property received.\n\n   So, Gulde would have a basis in the land equal to the partnership's basis in the land, which is $10,000.\n\n   But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure about the treatment of the gain in this context.\n\n9. **Alternative Calculation:**\n\n   Maybe I need to allocate the basis reduction between the cash and the property based on their relative fair market values.\n\n   Cash: $12,000\n\n   Land FMV: $30,000\n\n   Total FMV: $42,000\n\n   Allocation of basis reduction:\n\n   Cash portion: ($12,000 / $42,000) * $26,000 \u2248 $7,428.57\n\n   Land portion: ($30,000 / $42,000) * $26,000 \u2248 $18,571.43\n\n   But this seems inconsistent with the earlier approach.\n\n10. **Check the Formula Again:**\n\n    The general formula for the basis of property received in a liquidating distribution is:\n\n    Basis = Partnership's basis in the property + (Partner's basis - Sum of the basis of other properties received)\n\n    In this case, the partner received cash and land.\n\n    So, Basis of land = $10,000 + ($26,000 - $12,000) = $10,000 + $14,000 = $24,000\n\n    But this still doesn't match the options.\n\n11. **Consider the Maximum Basis Rule:**\n\n    The basis of the property received cannot exceed the partner's basis in the partnership interest.\n\n    So, if the partnership's basis in the land is $10,000 and the partner's basis is $26,000, the basis of the land would be $10,000, and the remaining basis ($26,000 - $10,000 = $16,000) would be treated as a gain.\n\n    Wait, that seems familiar.\n\n12. **Another Look at Gain Calculation:**\n\n    The gain is recognized when the amount realized exceeds the partner's basis.\n\n    Amount realized: $42,000\n\n    Basis: $26,000\n\n    Gain: $16,000\n\n    The basis of the property received is the lesser of:\n\n    - The partnership's basis in the property ($10,000)\n\n    - The partner's basis in the partnership interest reduced by any money distributed ($26,000 - $12,000 = $14,000)\n\n    So, the basis of the land is $10,000.\n\n    The excess of the amount realized over the partnership's basis in the property and the cash distributed leads to the recognized gain.\n\n13. **Confirm with an Example:**\n\n    Suppose the partnership has a basis of $10,000 in the land and distributes it with $12,000 cash to Gulde, who has a $26,000 basis.\n\n    Gulde's basis in the land would be $10,000, and he would recognize a gain of $16,000.\n\n    This seems consistent with tax principles.\n\n14. **Consider the \"Boot\" in the Distribution:**\n\n    When both property and cash are distributed, the cash is treated as reducing the partner's basis in the partnership interest.\n\n    Then, the basis of the property received is generally the partnership's basis in the property, increased by any gain recognized, but not exceeding the partner's adjusted basis.\n\n    So, perhaps the basis of the land is $10,000 + $16,000 = $26,000, but that exceeds the partnership's basis in the land, so it's capped at $10,000.\n\n15. **Check IRS Regulations:**\n\n    According to IRS Code Section 732(a), the basis of property received in a distribution is generally the partnership's basis in the property, increased by any money distributed in the same distribution, but not exceeding the partner's adjusted basis in the partnership interest.\n\n    However, in a liquidating distribution, Section 731 may apply, which deals with the recognition of gain or loss.\n\n    In a liquidating distribution, generally, gain is recognized to the extent of cash received in excess of the partner's basis.\n\n    In this case, Gulde received $12,000 cash and land with a partnership basis of $10,000, totaling $22,000, against his $26,000 basis.\n\n    Wait, that doesn't directly align.\n\n16. **Apply Section 732(a)(1):**\n\n    Under Section 732(a)(1), the basis of property received in a distribution is the partnership's basis in the property, increased by any money distributed in the same distribution, but not exceeding the partner's adjusted basis.\n\n    So, basis of land = $10,000 + $12,000 = $22,000\n\n    But Gulde's basis was $26,000, so $22,000 is less than $26,000, so basis is $22,000.\n\n    But earlier, I thought gain was $16,000, which doesn't fit here.\n\n17. **Alternative Calculation:**\n\n    Maybe the basis of the property is the partnership's basis plus the partner's basis minus the cash received.\n\n    So, $10,000 + ($26,000 - $12,000) = $10,000 + $14,000 = $24,000\n\n    But that still doesn't match the options.\n\n18. **Consider the Gain Recognition Again:**\n\n    The gain is recognized because the amount realized exceeds the partner's basis.\n\n    The amount realized is $42,000, basis is $26,000, so gain is $16,000.\n\n    This gain is recognized income to Gulde.\n\n    The basis of the property received is the partnership's basis in the property, increased by any gain recognized, but not exceeding the partner's basis.\n\n    So, $10,000 + $16,000 = $26,000, but that exceeds the partnership's basis in the property, so it's capped at $10,000.\n\n    Therefore, Gulde's basis in the land is $10,000.\n\n19. **Final Thought:**\n\n    Given the options provided (A. $0, B. $10,000, C. $14,000, D. $30,000), the most plausible answer seems to be $10,000.\n\n    The other options don't make as much sense based on the calculations and principles applied.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
