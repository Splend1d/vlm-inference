                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem about determining the rate law from some graphs. The problem says that when plotting the concentration of A versus time, and ln [A] versus time, both give curved lines. But when plotting 1/[A] versus time, it gives a straight line. I need to determine the rate law based on this information.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what different rate laws look like in terms of these graphs. I know that for a reaction where A turns into 2B, the rate law can be expressed as rate = k[A]^n, where n is the order of the reaction with respect to A.\n\nThere are common ways to determine the order of a reaction. One way is to look at how the concentration changes over time and see which mathematical form fits the data best.\n\nLet's consider the possible options:\n\nA. Rate = k[A] (first-order reaction)\n\nB. Rate = k[A]^2 (second-order reaction)\n\nC. Rate = k[A]^0 (zero-order reaction)\n\nD. Rate = k[A]^(-1) (negative first-order reaction)\n\nI need to see which of these would result in a straight line when plotting 1/[A] versus time.\n\nLet me think about each case:\n\n1. First-order reaction (Rate = k[A]):\n\nFor a first-order reaction, the integrated rate law is:\n\nln [A] = -kt + ln [A]\u2080\n\nThis should be a straight line when plotting ln [A] versus time, with a slope of -k. But according to the problem, plotting ln [A] versus time gives a curved line. So this can't be a first-order reaction.\n\n2. Second-order reaction (Rate = k[A]^2):\n\nFor a second-order reaction, the integrated rate law is:\n\n1/[A] = kt + 1/[A]\u2080\n\nThis should be a straight line when plotting 1/[A] versus time, with a slope of k and a y-intercept of 1/[A]\u2080. This matches what the problem states: plotting 1/[A] versus time gives a straight line.\n\n3. Zero-order reaction (Rate = k[A]^0 = k):\n\nFor a zero-order reaction, the integrated rate law is:\n\n[A] = -kt + [A]\u2080\n\nPlotting [A] versus time should give a straight line with a slope of -k. But the problem says that plotting [A] versus time gives a curved line. So this can't be a zero-order reaction.\n\n4. Negative first-order reaction (Rate = k[A]^(-1)):\n\nI'm not as familiar with this one. Let's see:\n\nIf rate = k[A]^(-1), then the differential rate law is:\n\n-d[A]/dt = k/[A]\n\nTo integrate this, I can rearrange:\n\n-dt = (k/[A]) d[A]\n\nIntegrating both sides:\n\n\u222bdt = -\u222b(k/[A]) d[A]\n\nt = -k ln|A| + C\n\nAt t=0, [A] = [A]\u2080, so C = -k ln [A]\u2080\n\nTherefore:\n\nt = -k ln|A| - k ln [A]\u2080\n\nt = -k ln([A]/[A]\u2080)\n\nSo, ln([A]/[A]\u2080) = -t/k\n\nThis looks similar to a first-order integrated rate law, which would give a straight line when plotting ln [A] versus time. But the problem says that plotting ln [A] versus time gives a curved line, so this can't be the case.\n\nWait, but according to this, plotting ln [A] versus time should give a straight line for a negative first-order reaction, but the problem says it's curved. So there must be something wrong with my assumption here.\n\nLet me double-check the integration:\n\nStarting with -dt = (k/[A]) d[A]\n\nIntegrate both sides:\n\n\u222bdt = -\u222b(k/[A]) d[A]\n\nt = -k ln|A| + C\n\nAt t=0, [A] = [A]\u2080:\n\n0 = -k ln|[A]\u2080| + C \u2192 C = k ln|[A]\u2080|\n\nSo, t = -k ln|A| + k ln|[A]\u2080| = k ln([A]\u2080/|A|)\n\nTherefore, ln([A]\u2080/[A]) = t/k\n\nThis is the integrated rate law for a reaction where rate is proportional to 1/[A]. So, plotting ln([A]\u2080/[A]) versus time should give a straight line with slope k.\n\nBut the problem says that plotting ln [A] versus time gives a curved line. Wait, is there a difference between plotting ln [A] and ln([A]\u2080/[A])?\n\nYes, ln([A]\u2080/[A]) = ln [A]\u2080 - ln [A]. So plotting ln [A] versus time would give a curve, while plotting ln([A]\u2080/[A]) versus time would give a straight line.\n\nGiven that, and considering the problem says plotting ln [A] versus time is curved, but plotting 1/[A] versus time is straight, it seems that the negative first-order reaction doesn't fit because it would predict a straight line when plotting ln([A]\u2080/[A]) versus time, not 1/[A] versus time.\n\nTherefore, the only option that fits the description is the second-order reaction, where plotting 1/[A] versus time gives a straight line.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- First-order: ln [A] vs. time should be straight, but the problem says it's curved.\n\n- Second-order: 1/[A] vs. time should be straight, which matches the problem's description.\n\n- Zero-order: [A] vs. time should be straight, but it's curved.\n\n- Negative first-order: ln [A] vs. time should be straight, but it's curved; however, plotting ln([A]\u2080/[A]) vs. time should be straight, which isn't matching the problem's description.\n\nTherefore, the correct rate law is Rate = k[A]^2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
