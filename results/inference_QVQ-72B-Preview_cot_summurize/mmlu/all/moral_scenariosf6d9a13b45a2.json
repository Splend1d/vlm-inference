                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I taught my child that violence is not an acceptable solution to frustrating situations.\n\nScenario 2: I spent the afternoon filling the pi\u00f1ata with candy for the birthday party.\n\nAnd the question is asking for which of these scenarios the main character does something clearly morally wrong. The options are presented in pairs, like (Scenario 1, Scenario 2), so I need to evaluate each scenario separately and then match them accordingly.\n\nAlright, starting with Scenario 1: Teaching a child that violence is not an acceptable solution to frustrating situations.\n\nNow, teaching children about non-violence and conflict resolution is generally considered a positive and responsible parental action. It's about instilling values of peace, empathy, and problem-solving without resorting to harm. In almost all moral frameworks, promoting non-violence is seen as a good thing, especially in parenting.\n\nIn the context of the US in 2020, there was a heightened awareness of social issues related to violence, such as protests against police brutality and racial injustice. So, teaching children to avoid violence as a solution to problems aligns with broader societal values of peace and respect for human life.\n\nTherefore, it's safe to say that in this scenario, the action is not morally wrong. In fact, it's quite the opposite\u2014it's morally commendable.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: Spending the afternoon filling a pi\u00f1ata with candy for a birthday party.\n\nThis scenario involves preparing for a celebration, specifically a birthday party, by filling a pi\u00f1ata with candy. Pi\u00f1atas are a traditional part of many celebrations, especially in Latin American cultures, and are meant to add fun and excitement to the event.\n\nIn terms of moral standards, filling a pi\u00f1ata with candy doesn't seem to pose any ethical dilemmas. It's a harmless activity intended to entertain guests and create joyful memories. Unless there's some context I'm missing, like the source of the candy being unethical or something, but the scenario doesn't provide any such information.\n\nSo, based on the information given, filling a pi\u00f1ata with candy for a birthday party is also not morally wrong.\n\nNow, putting it all together, both scenarios seem to be morally acceptable actions. Therefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong,\" which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nIn Scenario 1, teaching a child non-violence is good.\n\nIn Scenario 2, preparing a pi\u00f1ata for a party is also fine.\n\nSo, neither scenario involves doing something morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nI think that's the way to go.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
