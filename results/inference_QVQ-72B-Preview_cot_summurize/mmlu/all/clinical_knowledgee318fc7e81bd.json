Hmm, I need to remember what somatic cells are and how many chromosomes they have.\n\nFirst off, I know that somatic cells are the cells in the body that make up tissues and organs, right? So, unlike germ cells, which are involved in reproduction, somatic cells are just for the everyday functioning of the body.\n\nNow, I recall that human cells carry chromosomes, which are structures that hold our DNA. These chromosomes come in pairs, and I think the total number in a somatic cell is 46. Let me double-check that.\n\nI remember that there are 22 pairs of autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes, which would make a total of 24 pairs, but that doesn't add up to 46. Wait, no, 22 pairs of autosomes would be 44 chromosomes, plus the 2 sex chromosomes, making it 46 in total. So, that seems correct.\n\nLet me see if there's any exception or special case where somatic cells might have a different number. No, I don't think so. Generally, all somatic cells in a human have 46 chromosomes.\n\nWait a minute, I've heard of something called polyploidy, where cells have extra sets of chromosomes, but that's usually abnormal in humans, except for certain tissues like liver cells, which might have more chromosomes. But generally, somatic cells are diploid, meaning they have two sets of chromosomes, totaling 46.\n\nAlso, in reproduction, germ cells go through meiosis and end up with half the number of chromosomes, which is 23, but we're talking about somatic cells here, not germ cells.\n\nSo, based on that, the correct answer should be D. 46.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's eliminate the other options:\n\nA. 3: That's way too few; that's not even close to the human chromosome count.\n\nB. 20: That's also incorrect; humans have many more chromosomes than that.\n\nC. 23: This is the number of chromosomes in a single set, or in germ cells after meiosis, but not in somatic cells.\n\nD. 46: As I explained, this is the standard number of chromosomes in human somatic cells.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 46.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
