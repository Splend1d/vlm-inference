The options are:\n\nA. Zero price elasticity of demand.\n\nB. Infinite price elasticity of demand.\n\nC. Unit price elasticity of demand.\n\nD. Indefinite price elasticity of demand.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what price elasticity of demand (PED) is. PED measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in the price of that good. It's calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nPED = \\frac{\\text{percentage change in quantity demanded}}{\\text{percentage change in price}}\n\\]\n\nSo, if a 10% increase in price causes a 10% decrease in quantity demanded, plugging into the formula:\n\n\\[\nPED = \\frac{-10\\%}{10\\%} = -1\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, if price decreases by 10%, quantity demanded increases by 10%, which again gives a PED of -1.\n\nNow, the negative sign indicates the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded, but often in discussions, we ignore the sign and focus on the magnitude.\n\nSo, in this case, the absolute value of PED is 1, which is referred to as unit price elasticity.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Zero price elasticity of demand.\n\nThis would mean that quantity demanded doesn't change at all when price changes, which is perfectly inelastic demand. That's not matching our scenario.\n\nB. Infinite price elasticity of demand.\n\nThis would imply that even a tiny change in price leads to an infinitely large change in quantity demanded, which is perfectly elastic demand. Not our case here.\n\nC. Unit price elasticity of demand.\n\nThis seems to fit, as PED is exactly 1, meaning a 1% change in price leads to a 1% change in quantity demanded in the opposite direction.\n\nD. Indefinite price elasticity of demand.\n\nThis option sounds a bit vague. I'm not sure what \"indefinite\" means in this context, but it doesn't seem to align with the description provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. Unit price elasticity of demand.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any chance that \"indefinite\" could be another term for unit elasticity? Maybe in some contexts, but I don't think so. It seems like a distractor option.\n\nAlso, option A, zero elasticity, is completely inelastic, meaning quantity doesn't respond to price changes at all, which is different from our scenario.\n\nOption B, infinite elasticity, is the opposite extreme, where any small change in price causes quantity demanded to change drastically, almost infinitely.\n\nOption C is straightforward and matches our calculation.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
