                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Sullivan's (2000) study on housework and men's involvement in it. There are four options, and I need to pick the one that best describes when men did the most housework according to this study. Let me read the options again to make sure I understand.\n\nOption A says: when they had rediscovered themselves as 'new men'.\n\nOption B: when their wives were at home and nagged them all the time.\n\nOption C: when exciting gadgets like the hoover and electric iron were invented.\n\nOption D: when they were unemployed or both partners worked full time.\n\nHmm, interesting. I need to think about this carefully. Let me consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Option A: 'new men' who have rediscovered themselves. I'm not entirely sure what 'rediscovered themselves' means in this context. Maybe it refers to a shift in gender roles or men embracing more domestic responsibilities. That could potentially lead to them doing more housework. But I need more information to decide if this is the correct answer.\n\nMoving on to Option B: wives nagging them all the time. This seems a bit simplistic. Nagging might temporarily increase the amount of housework men do, but it's not necessarily a long-term solution. In fact, it might lead to resentment or decreased willingness over time. So, I doubt this is the main factor in Sullivan's study.\n\nOption C: the invention of exciting gadgets like the hoover and electric iron. Technology can certainly make housework easier, but does it necessarily increase the amount men do? Maybe somewhat, if men are more interested in using new gadgets. But again, I don't think this is the primary factor determining men's involvement in housework.\n\nLastly, Option D: when men are unemployed or both partners work full time. This seems plausible. If a man is unemployed, he might take on more housework to fill his time or to support the family while his partner works. Similarly, if both are working full time, they might share responsibilities more equally out of necessity.\n\nBut wait, the question is about what Sullivan's study suggested, not about what I think generally. I need to recall what Sullivan found in his 2000 study. I remember that Sullivan looked at various factors influencing men's participation in housework, including cultural shifts, technological advancements, and employment status.\n\nLet me try to recall specific findings from Sullivan's study. I think he found that men's involvement in housework increased when both partners were employed full time. This might be because there's a greater need for sharing responsibilities due to time constraints. Also, in cases where men are unemployed, they might do more housework as a way to contribute to the household while not earning an income.\n\nBut I should consider whether one of these scenarios leads to greater involvement than the other. Maybe being unemployed makes a man feel obliged to do more housework, but if both are working, there might be more equal sharing. However, I need to think about whether Sullivan's study found that unemployment or mutual full-time employment led to the highest proportion of housework done by men.\n\nI should also consider that in some cultures or time periods, men might resist doing housework if they're unemployed, feeling that it's beneath them or not aligned with traditional masculine roles. On the other hand, if both are working, there might be more acceptance of sharing chores.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the 'new men' in Option A refers to a cultural shift where men are more accepting of domestic roles. If that's the case, perhaps these men do more housework because of a change in attitude.\n\nBut I need to balance this with the other options. The invention of new gadgets (Option C) might make doing housework more appealing to some men, but I don't think it's the primary driver of increased involvement.\n\nAlso, Option B seems unlikely to be the main factor, as nagging isn't a sustainable or positive way to encourage long-term participation in housework.\n\nSo, between Options A and D, Option D seems more straightforward and logically connected to increased housework participation by men. If both partners are working full time, there's a practical need to share chores to manage time effectively. Similarly, if a man is unemployed, he might take on more housework to compensate for not bringing in income.\n\nBut I need to think about which one of these scenarios would lead to the greatest proportion of housework done by men. Maybe when a man is unemployed, he does more housework because he has more free time and less income to hire help. Whereas if both are working, they might split chores equally, but perhaps not to the same extent as when one partner is unemployed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in dual-income households, there's a more equal distribution of labor, leading to a higher proportion of housework done by men compared to traditional households where only the woman works.\n\nI need to recall if Sullivan's study provided specific data on this. I think his research indicated that men do more housework when both partners are employed full time, as there's a greater need for sharing responsibilities.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that in cases of unemployment, men might do more housework out of necessity, but perhaps not to the same degree as in dual-income households where there's a cultural norm of sharing.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the concept of the \"second shift,\" where working women often come home to another shift of housework. Perhaps in dual-income households, despite efforts to share, women still end up doing more housework, meaning men's proportion is still less than equal.\n\nBut the question is about when men do the greatest proportion of housework, not about absolute amounts or comparisons to women's contributions.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the question to myself: in which scenario did Sullivan find that men contributed the most to housework?\n\nOption A: 'new men' who have rediscovered themselves. This seems vague. Maybe it's a cultural shift, but I don't recall specific findings linking this to higher housework participation.\n\nOption B: wives nagging all the time. This doesn't seem like a solid basis for increased housework participation; it feels more like a temporary solution rather than a structural change.\n\nOption C: invention of gadgets. While technology can make housework easier, it doesn't necessarily lead to men doing more of it. Maybe some men are more inclined to use these gadgets, but I doubt this is the main factor.\n\nOption D: unemployment or both working full time. This seems the most logical choice. When men are unemployed, they might do more housework out of necessity. When both are working, there's often an effort to share chores more equally.\n\nBut between unemployment and both working, which leads to a greater proportion of housework done by men?\n\nI need to think carefully here. In dual-income households, there might be more equal sharing, but in reality, studies often find that women still do more housework even when they work full time.\n\nPerhaps in households where both partners work full time, there's a higher expectation of sharing, leading to a greater proportion of housework done by men compared to when men are unemployed.\n\nAlternatively, when men are unemployed, they might do more housework simply because they have more time, but their overall contribution might still be less than their employed counterparts.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the concept of time availability versus motivation.\n\nIf a man is unemployed, he has more time to do housework, but his motivation might be lower due to feelings of inadequacy or traditional gender roles.\n\nIn contrast, if both are working, there's a mutual understanding that chores need to be shared to manage time effectively, which might lead to higher motivation and thus a greater proportion of housework done by men.\n\nMoreover, in dual-income households, there might be more modern attitudes towards gender roles, further encouraging men to participate more in housework.\n\nOn the other hand, if a man is unemployed, he might feel pressure to contribute more to the household in non-monetary ways, such as doing housework, which could also lead to a higher proportion of housework done by him.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should look for some general trends in housework distribution.\n\nI recall that in many studies, men tend to do more housework when their wives work full time, but women still do the majority even in dual-income households.\n\nHowever, the question is specifically about Sullivan's (2000) study.\n\nLet me try to recall if Sullivan found any unique factors in his research.\n\nI think Sullivan emphasized the importance of employment status in determining housework distribution.\n\nSpecifically, he might have found that when men are unemployed, they do more housework, but perhaps not as much as when both partners are employed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in dual-income households, there's a higher proportion of housework done by men due to shared responsibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is both: men do more housework when they're unemployed or when both partners work full time.\n\nBut the question asks for the greatest proportion, so it's likely one or the other.\n\nI need to make a choice here.\n\nLet me consider that in dual-income households, there's often a cultural norm towards equality, and men might be more accepting of doing housework.\n\nWhereas in households where men are unemployed, despite having more time, there might be less motivation or acceptance of doing housework.\n\nTherefore, I'm leaning towards Option D: when they are unemployed or both partners work full time.\n\nBut to make sure, let's think about it differently.\n\nMaybe I should consider that in dual-income households, there's a higher proportion of housework done by men because there's an expectation of sharing.\n\nWhereas in households where men are unemployed, even if they do more housework in absolute terms, the proportion might still be less because women are doing even more.\n\nBut I need to focus on the proportion done by men, not the total amount.\n\nPerhaps the proportion is higher in dual-income households because men are doing, say, 40% of the chores, whereas if the man is unemployed, he might do 30% of the chores while the woman does 70%.\n\nBut I'm just guessing numbers here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in dual-income households, men do a higher proportion because there's a clearer need for sharing.\n\nWhereas if the man is unemployed, there might be traditional expectations that the woman should do more, even if the man has more time.\n\nGiven that, I think Option D is the best answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider Option A again: 'new men' who have rediscovered themselves.\n\nThis sounds like a cultural shift in masculinity, where men are more accepting of domestic roles.\n\nIf that's the case, perhaps these men do a higher proportion of housework because of their changed attitudes.\n\nHowever, I don't recall Sullivan's study focusing specifically on this aspect.\n\nMaybe it's a lesser factor compared to employment status.\n\nTherefore, I still think Option D is the most accurate based on what I recall from Sullivan's research.\n\nIn conclusion, according to Sullivan's (2000) study, the proportion of housework men did was greatest when they were unemployed or both partners worked full time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
