The options are broadcast media, interactive media, in-store media, and support media. Hmm, let me think about this.\n\nFirst off, broadcast media usually refers to things like TV and radio ads that are sent out to a wide audience. But in this case, we're talking about media that's right there in the store, trying to influence people while they're shopping. So, broadcast media seems a bit too broad for that purpose.\n\nInteractive media is interesting. It involves things where the consumer can engage or respond, like online ads or apps. But again, the question is about media that's specifically in-store, trying to stimulate immediate purchases. While there might be some interactive elements in stores, I'm not sure if that's the primary type here.\n\nSupport media sounds like it might be auxiliary or additional forms of advertising, maybe things like billboards or direct mail. But again, those aren't typically found inside stores. So, maybe not the best fit for this scenario.\n\nThat leaves in-store media. This sounds promising. It's right in the name \u2013 media that's located inside stores. So, point-of-purchase displays, which are like special stands or arrangements that showcase products attractively, are definitely part of in-store media. Packaging can also be considered a form of in-store media because it's what customers see and interact with while shopping.\n\nLet me double-check. The question mentions examples like point-of-purchase displays and packaging. Both of these are elements that are present in the store environment, designed to catch the eye of shoppers and possibly influence their buying decisions on the spot.\n\nSo, considering that, it seems like in-store media is the correct category for this description. It's specifically tailored to the retail setting and aims to stimulate purchases directly.\n\nI think the answer is C. In-store media.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
