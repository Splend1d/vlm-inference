Hoover Dam.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these isn't located in Nevada. Let me think about each option one by one.\n\nFirst up, the Liberace Museum. I know that Liberace was a famous pianist and entertainer, and I recall that he performed many times in Las Vegas. Las Vegas is in Nevada, right? So, it makes sense that the Liberace Museum would be in Las Vegas, which is in Nevada. So, probably, the Liberace Museum is in Nevada.\n\nNext, Pikes Peak. Hmm, I've heard of Pikes Peak, but I'm not sure where it is. Let me see. I think it's a mountain, maybe part of the Rocky Mountains. I remember something about Colorado and the Rockies. Wait, Colorado is known for its mountains, like Denver being the Mile High City. Maybe Pikes Peak is in Colorado? Let me try to recall if there are any famous peaks in Nevada. There's Mount Charleston, but that's different. I don't think Pikes Peak is in Nevada. Maybe it's the answer.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's consider Lake Mead. Lake Mead is a man-made lake, right? It's created by the Hoover Dam, which holds back the Colorado River. The Hoover Dam is on the border between Nevada and Arizona. So, part of it is in Nevada and part in Arizona. Similarly, Lake Mead should be mostly in Nevada, but maybe it extends into Arizona as well. But since it's associated with the Hoover Dam, which is in Nevada, I think Lake Mead is considered to be in Nevada.\n\nLastly, the Hoover Dam. As I mentioned earlier, it's on the border between Nevada and Arizona. It's a massive hydroelectric dam that's a major landmark. While it straddles the border, I believe it's commonly associated with Nevada, especially since Las Vegas is nearby and relies on the water from the Colorado River that the dam regulates.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Liberace Museum: in Nevada (Las Vegas)\n\n- Pikes Peak: probably not in Nevada, maybe in Colorado\n\n- Lake Mead: in Nevada (and partly in Arizona)\n\n- Hoover Dam: on the Nevada/Arizona border, but associated with Nevada\n\nTherefore, the one that's not in Nevada is Pikes Peak.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll recall if there's any famous connection of Pikes Peak to Nevada. No, I don't think so. It seems to be more associated with Colorado Springs in Colorado. So, I'm confident that Pikes Peak is not located in Nevada.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. Pikes Peak}} \\]"
