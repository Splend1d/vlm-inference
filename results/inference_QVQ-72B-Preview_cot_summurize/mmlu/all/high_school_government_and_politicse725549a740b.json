First Amendment, B. Second Amendment, C. Third Amendment, D. Eighth Amendment.\n\nAlright, I need to figure out which amendment protects the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances. I remember that the Bill of Rights is the first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and they protect various individual liberties.\n\nLet me recall what each of these amendments is about.\n\nStarting with the First Amendment: I know that it guarantees several freedoms, including freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, and the right to petition the government. So, it seems like the right to petition the government is part of the First Amendment.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me think about the other amendments mentioned in the options.\n\nThe Second Amendment is about the right to bear arms, which is a different thing altogether. It's about gun rights and militias.\n\nThe Third Amendment deals with quartering of soldiers in private homes, which doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nThe Eighth Amendment addresses excessive bail, fines, and cruel and unusual punishments, which are related to legal proceedings and punishments.\n\nSo, none of these seem to relate to the right to petition the government. The First Amendment seems the most fitting.\n\nWait a minute, I should make sure that the right to petition is indeed part of the First Amendment. I think I have a vague memory of it being there, but I might be confusing it with something else.\n\nLet me try to recite the First Amendment in my mind. It goes something like this: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\"\n\nYes, that sounds right. So, the right to petition the government is indeed protected by the First Amendment.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider if there's any other amendment that might also relate to this right. For example, the Ninth Amendment says that the enumeration of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people, but that doesn't specifically protect the right to petition.\n\nThe Tenth Amendment reserves powers to the states or the people, which again doesn't directly address this issue.\n\nSo, among the options given, the First Amendment is the correct choice.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the right of American citizens to petition the government for a redress of grievances is protected under the __________.\" And it's multiple choice with A. First Amendment, B. Second Amendment, C. Third Amendment, D. Eighth Amendment.\n\nGiven that, and my recollection of the First Amendment, I'm confident that A. First Amendment is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility of misinterpretation. Perhaps the term \"redress of grievances\" could be interpreted in a different context, but I don't think so. It's a pretty straightforward phrase meaning the ability to ask the government to address or remedy a wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. First Amendment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ First Amendment}} \\]"
