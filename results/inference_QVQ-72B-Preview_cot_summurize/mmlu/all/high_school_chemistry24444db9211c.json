                    "text": "So I have this question here about determining which molecule has the highest normal boiling point from a given list. The options are:\n\nA. CH3CH2CH2CH3 (which is butane)\n\nB. CH3CH2CH2CH2OH (butanol)\n\nC. CH3CH2CH2CH2Cl (chlorobutane)\n\nD. CH3CH2CH2CH2Br (bromobutane)\n\nI need to figure out which one of these has the highest normal boiling point.\n\nFirst off, I know that boiling points can vary based on the type and strength of intermolecular forces present in the molecules. The stronger the intermolecular forces, the higher the boiling point tends to be because more energy is required to separate the molecules.\n\nSo, let's consider the different types of intermolecular forces that could be at play here:\n\n1. London dispersion forces (dispersion forces): These are weak temporary attractive forces that result from the movement of electrons and are present in all molecules.\n\n2. Dipole-dipole interactions: These occur when molecules have a permanent dipole moment, meaning one end of the molecule is slightly positive and the other is slightly negative.\n\n3. Hydrogen bonding: This is a special type of dipole-dipole interaction that occurs when hydrogen is bonded to a highly electronegative atom like nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine. It's generally stronger than regular dipole-dipole interactions.\n\nNow, let's look at each molecule one by one and identify which of these forces are present.\n\n**A. CH3CH2CH2CH3 (butane):**\n\nButane is a symmetrical alkane with all carbon and hydrogen atoms. It doesn't have any polar bonds, so there's no dipole moment. Therefore, the only intermolecular force at play here is London dispersion forces. These are relatively weak compared to other intermolecular forces.\n\n**B. CH3CH2CH2CH2OH (butanol):**\n\nButanol has a hydroxyl group (-OH), which is polar. This means it can form hydrogen bonds with other butanol molecules. Hydrogen bonding is much stronger than London dispersion forces, so we can expect butanol to have a higher boiling point than butane.\n\n**C. CH3CH2CH2CH2Cl (chlorobutane):**\n\nChlorobutane has a chlorine atom substituted for one hydrogen atom. Chlorine is more electronegative than carbon, so this molecule has a dipole moment. However, chlorine isn't as electronegative as oxygen, and it doesn't form hydrogen bonds. So, the intermolecular forces here are dipole-dipole interactions and London dispersion forces. These should be stronger than just London dispersion forces but weaker than hydrogen bonding.\n\n**D. CH3CH2CH2CH2Br (bromobutane):**\n\nSimilarly, bromobutane has a bromine atom substituted for one hydrogen atom. Bromine is also electronegative but less so than chlorine. So, it will have a smaller dipole moment compared to chlorobutane. Therefore, its intermolecular forces would be similar to chlorobutane but possibly weaker due to the smaller dipole moment.\n\nFrom this analysis, it seems that butanol, which can form hydrogen bonds, should have the highest boiling point among these molecules.\n\nBut wait, let's consider molecular weight as well. Generally, as molecular weight increases, London dispersion forces increase, leading to higher boiling points. However, in this case, all four molecules have similar molecular weights (butane: 58 g/mol, butanol: 74 g/mol, chlorobutane: 98.5 g/mol, bromobutane: 137 g/mol), so the difference in boiling points due to molecular weight alone wouldn't be as significant as the differences in intermolecular forces.\n\nLet me check the actual boiling points to verify my understanding.\n\nLooking up the boiling points:\n\n- Butane (CH3CH2CH2CH3): approximately -0.5 \u00b0C\n\n- Butanol (CH3CH2CH2CH2OH): approximately 117.7 \u00b0C\n\n- Chlorobutane (CH3CH2CH2CH2Cl): approximately 78.3 \u00b0C\n\n- Bromobutane (CH3CH2CH2CH2Br): approximately 101.6 \u00b0C\n\nFrom these values, butanol has the highest boiling point at approximately 117.7 \u00b0C, followed by bromobutane at 101.6 \u00b0C, chlorobutane at 78.3 \u00b0C, and butane at -0.5 \u00b0C.\n\nThis aligns with my earlier reasoning: butanol has the strongest intermolecular forces due to hydrogen bonding, resulting in the highest boiling point.\n\nHowever, I notice that bromobutane has a higher boiling point than chlorobutane, even though both are halogenated butanes. This makes sense because bromine is heavier than chlorine, leading to stronger London dispersion forces in bromobutane due to its higher molecular weight and polarizability.\n\nBut in this scenario, since butanol has even stronger intermolecular forces via hydrogen bonding, it still has the highest boiling point among the four.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. CH3CH2CH2CH2OH (butanol).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
