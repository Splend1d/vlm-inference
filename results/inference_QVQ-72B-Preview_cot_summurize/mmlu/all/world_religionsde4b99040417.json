                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here: \"Which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity?\" And the options are A. Greek Orthodox, B. Roman Catholic, C. Puritans, D. Quakers. Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out which one of these is known for simplifying or stripping down their practices or beliefs in Christianity.\n\nFirst off, I should probably understand what \"stripped-down Christianity\" means. I think it refers to a form of Christianity that emphasizes simplicity, perhaps doing away with elaborate rituals, decorations, or hierarchical structures. Maybe it's about going back to the basics of Christian teachings, focusing more on personal faith and less on ceremonial aspects.\n\nAlright, let's consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with A. Greek Orthodox. I know that the Greek Orthodox Church is part of the Eastern Orthodox tradition, which is known for its rich liturgies, iconic artwork, and deep-rooted ceremonies. They have a lot of traditions and practices that have been passed down for centuries. From what I recall, they don't seem to advocate for a stripped-down approach. In fact, their services are quite elaborate with incense, chanting, and processions. So, maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nNext, B. Roman Catholic. Catholics are known for their structured hierarchy, elaborate rituals, and ornate churches. Think of the Vatican and all its grandeur. Catholicism has a lot of sacraments\u2014seven to be exact\u2014and a complex theological system. While there have been movements within Catholicism that advocate for simplicity, like certain monastic orders, the church as a whole doesn't seem to promote a stripped-down version of Christianity. So, probably not the answer.\n\nNow, C. Puritans. I remember learning about the Puritans in history class. They were a group of Protestant Christians who emerged in 16th and 17th-century England. They were dissatisfied with the Church of England and wanted to \"purify\" it by removing what they saw as remnants of Catholicism. They advocated for simpler worship services, plain sermons, and a greater emphasis on Scripture. They also rejected ornate church decorations and elaborate rituals. So, this sounds like they promoted a more stripped-down approach to Christianity, focusing on the essentials.\n\nLastly, D. Quakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends. Quakers are known for their simple worship styles. They often meet in plain meeting houses without altars, pulpits, or religious symbols. Their services are characterized by silent worship, where individuals speak only if they feel moved by the Holy Spirit. This certainly seems like a stripped-down approach, emphasizing spiritual experience over formal rituals.\n\nSo, now I have to decide between the Puritans and the Quakers, both of whom seem to promote simplicity in Christianity.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. The Puritans wanted to purify the Church of England by removing what they considered to be unnecessary traditions and decorations, but they still maintained a structured form of worship and believed in predestination, which might not be considered \"stripped-down\" in terms of theology.\n\nOn the other hand, Quakers take simplicity to another level. They don't have ordained clergy, and their meetings are entirely based on spontaneous speech and prayer. Their approach is very minimalistic, focusing on direct experience of God without any mediating institutions or elaborate practices.\n\nSo, if I had to choose between the two, I'd say that Quakers promote a more stripped-down version of Christianity, as their worship is extremely simple and devoid of the trappings that are common in many other Christian denominations.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if there's any other information that could influence my decision. For example, the Puritans were known for their strict moral codes and emphasis on individual piety, which could also be seen as a form of stripping down to the essentials.\n\nHowever, Quakers go even further in their quest for simplicity, not just in worship but also in their lifestyle. They advocate for plain speech, simple dress, and peaceful living. Their approach to Christianity is indeed very basic and focused on inner spirituality.\n\nI think I've made up my mind. The answer should be D. Quakers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
