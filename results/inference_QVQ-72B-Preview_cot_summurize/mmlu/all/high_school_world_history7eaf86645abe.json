                    "text": "Let's dive into this question. So, we've got this passage from \"The Book of Routes and Realms\" by Abu Ubaydallah al-Bakri, who was an eleventh-century Muslim historian and geographer. The passage describes some aspects of the city of Ghana, which is interesting because nowadays, Ghana is a country in West Africa, but back then, it was a prominent kingdom in the region.\n\nThe question is asking about the economy of Ghana based on this passage. There are four options, and I need to determine which one correctly describes the economy as per the text.\n\nOption A says: \"The king of Ghana's subjects are engaged in salt mining.\"\n\nOption B: \"The Ghanians raised cattle for meat and hides.\"\n\nOption C: \"The king of Ghana taxed salt and copper imports and exports.\"\n\nOption D: \"The Ghanians had a self-sufficient farming economy.\"\n\nFirst, I need to carefully read the passage and identify parts that relate to the economy.\n\nStarting from the beginning: \"The city of Ghana consists of two towns. One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables.\"\n\nHere, it mentions that they grow vegetables using water from wells, which suggests some agricultural activity, but it doesn't specify the extent or whether this agriculture is self-sufficient.\n\nMoving on: \"The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means.\"\n\nThis part talks about the royal court and dress codes, but doesn't directly address the economy.\n\nNext: \"The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. ... He sits ... in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands.\"\n\nThis seems to describe the king's attire and how he is greeted, which again doesn't directly relate to the economy.\n\nThen: \"[The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. ... On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals.\"\n\nAh, this part mentions taxes on salt and copper, both when salt is brought in and sent out, and on copper and other goods. This suggests that the king imposes taxes on trade, particularly on salt and copper.\n\nContinuing: \"The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this, the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value.\"\n\nHere, it talks about gold mining. The king keeps the nuggets, and the people get the gold dust. This indicates that gold mining is a significant activity in Ghana, and there's a system in place to regulate the distribution of gold.\n\nFinally: \"Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani.\"\n\nThis part is about a neighboring region and doesn't relate to Ghana's economy.\n\nSo, let's summarize what we've found:\n\n- Agriculture: some vegetable growing using well water.\n\n- Trade: taxes on salt and copper imports and exports.\n\n- Mining: gold mining, with nuggets reserved for the king and dust for the people.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. The king of Ghana's subjects are engaged in salt mining.\n\nThe passage mentions taxes on salt imports and exports but doesn't specify that the subjects are engaged in salt mining. It's possible that salt is being mined within the country or imported from elsewhere. The passage doesn't provide enough information to confirm that the subjects are directly involved in salt mining.\n\nB. The Ghanians raised cattle for meat and hides.\n\nThe passage doesn't mention cattle raising or any livestock activities. It only mentions that they grow vegetables using well water.\n\nC. The king of Ghana taxed salt and copper imports and exports.\n\nThis directly aligns with the passage. It clearly states that the king levies taxes on every donkey-load of salt brought into or sent out of the country and also taxes copper and other goods.\n\nD. The Ghanians had a self-sufficient farming economy.\n\nWhile the passage mentions growing vegetables using well water, it doesn't provide enough information to conclude that their farming economy was self-sufficient. Moreover, the presence of trade in salt and copper suggests that they were involved in external trade, which might indicate that their economy wasn't entirely self-sufficient.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C seems to be the most accurate description of Ghana's economy as per the passage. The king taxed salt and copper imports and exports, indicating that trade was a significant part of the economy.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. The passage mentions that they grow vegetables using well water, which suggests some agriculture, but it doesn't say anything about the scale or whether this agriculture was sufficient for their needs. It also mentions that beyond Ghana lies another country called Malal, but doesn't provide more context about economic activities there.\n\nAdditionally, the passage talks about gold mining and the king's regulation of gold nuggets and dust, which further emphasizes the importance of mining and trade in the economy.\n\nTherefore, while option C accurately reflects the information given about taxation on salt and copper trade, it's possible that other economic activities also played a role. However, among the given options, C is the one that is directly supported by the passage.\n\nWait a minute, option A says \"The king of Ghana's subjects are engaged in salt mining.\" But the passage only mentions taxes on salt imports and exports; it doesn't specify who is mining the salt. It could be that salt is being mined within the country by subjects, or it could be imported from elsewhere. Since the passage doesn't provide this information, we can't confirm option A.\n\nOption B mentions cattle raising, which isn't mentioned in the passage at all, so we can eliminate that.\n\nOption D suggests a self-sufficient farming economy, but the passage only mentions growing vegetables using well water, which isn't enough to support the idea of a fully self-sufficient farming economy, especially considering the involvement in trade.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is option C: \"The king of Ghana taxed salt and copper imports and exports.\"\n\nTo make sure, let's look back at the relevant part of the passage: \"On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals.\"\n\nThis clearly indicates that the king imposed taxes on the import and export of salt and on copper and other goods. Hence, option C is the accurate description of Ghana's economy based on the provided passage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
