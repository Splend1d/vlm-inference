Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that a Reuben sandwich is a classic American sandwich that originated in the early 20th century. It's usually made with corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing, all grilled between two slices of rye bread. So, based on that, option C, corned beef, seems like a strong candidate.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider each option:\n\nA. Turkey: Turkey is often used in sandwiches, but it's not traditionally associated with the Reuben sandwich. Plus, I don't recall turkey being part of the original Reuben recipe.\n\nB. Bologna: Bologna is another type of deli meat, but again, it's not typically used in a Reuben sandwich. Bologna is more common in simple deli sandwiches or school lunches.\n\nC. Corned Beef: This seems spot on. Corned beef is a key ingredient in the classic Reuben sandwich. It's flavorful and pairs well with the other ingredients like Swiss cheese and sauerkraut.\n\nD. Pepperoni: Pepperoni is usually found in pizzas or sometimes in cold cut sandwiches, but not in a Reuben sandwich. It doesn't fit with the traditional recipe.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I'm pretty confident that the correct answer is C. corned beef. That's the meat that's traditionally used in a Reuben sandwich.\n\nJust to double-check, I can think about the history of the Reuben sandwich. It was first popularized in New York City, possibly in a restaurant called Reuben's Cafe, hence the name Reuben sandwich. Corned beef is a popular meat in New York delis, which further supports my choice.\n\nAdditionally, I can think about the flavors involved. Corned beef has a distinct salty and savory taste that complements the tanginess of sauerkraut and the richness of Swiss cheese. Russian dressing adds a sweet and spicy element, making it a balanced and delicious combination.\n\nI don't think turkey, bologna, or pepperoni would work as well in this context. Turkey might be a healthier alternative, but it doesn't have the same robust flavor as corned beef. Bologna is too mild and doesn't pair well with the other ingredients. Pepperoni is spicy and would clash with the traditional flavors of the Reuben.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the traditional Reuben sandwich features corned beef. So, the answer is C. corned beef.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
