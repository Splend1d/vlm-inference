                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"What fictional character claims to be 'smarter than the average bear'?\" And the options are Paddington Bear, Fozzie Bear, Smokey Bear, and Yogi Bear. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these characters says that phrase.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what \"smarter than the average bear\" means. I think it's a play on words, suggesting that the character is smarter than most bears, right? But since all these options are fictional bears, maybe they all think they're smarter than the average bear. But no, the question is specifically asking which one claims to be so.\n\nLet me think about each character one by one.\n\nStarting with Paddington Bear. I remember Paddington from the books and movies. He's a polite, well-mannered bear from Peru who ends up in London. He's known for his love of marmalade sandwiches and his red hat. But does he ever claim to be smarter than the average bear? Hmm, I don't recall him saying that. He seems more humble and perhaps a bit naive at times, especially when he gets into tricky situations. So, maybe not him.\n\nNext is Fozzie Bear. He's from the Muppet Show, right? He's known for his bad jokes and puns, which often make the other Muppets groan. He's a lovable goofball, but again, I don't recall him claiming to be smarter than the average bear. In fact, his jokes are so corny that it might be ironic if he said he was smarter than the average bear. But I think it's more of a stretch with him.\n\nThen there's Smokey Bear. Wait, actually, I think Smokey Bear is a real bear, not fictional. He's a symbol of the United States Forest Service and is famous for the phrase \"Only you can prevent forest fires.\" But he's more of an icon than a fictional character in the same way as the others. Plus, I don't remember him making any claims about being smarter than other bears. So, probably not him either.\n\nThat leaves Yogi Bear. Yogi is a cartoon character from Hanna-Barbera productions. He's known for living in Jellystone Park and often getting into mischief with his friend Boo-Boo. Yogi is portrayed as clever and resourceful, often outsmarting the park ranger, Ranger Smith. He's famous for saying things like \"Yogi Bear always says...\" and \"That's my motto.\" Now, thinking back, I seem to recall him saying something about being smarter than the average bear.\n\nLet me double-check that. I remember that Yogi would sometimes refer to himself as \"smarter than the average bear.\" It was part of his personality to be confident and self-assured, sometimes to the point of being a bit arrogant. His intelligence was a recurring theme in the show, especially in how he outwits Ranger Smith to get food or avoid being caught.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like Yogi Bear is the one who claims to be smarter than the average bear. Let me see if I can find any specific quotes to confirm this.\n\nAfter a quick search in my memory, I recall a episode where Yogi says, \"Hey there, Boo-Boo. I'm Yogi Bear, and I'm smarter than the average bear.\" Another time, he might say, \"Well, Boo-Boo, you know I'm smarter than the average bear, so I have a plan.\" These lines suggest that Yogi frequently boasts about his intelligence compared to other bears.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if any of the other characters might have said something similar. Paddington is known for his kindness and sometimes clumsy behavior, but not particularly for claiming superior intelligence. Fozzie is known for his humor, which isn't directly related to intelligence in that way. Smokey Bear is more about environmental messages.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting answer is Yogi Bear. He's the one who consistently portrays himself as smarter than the average bear in his dialogue and actions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Yogi Bear}} \\]"
