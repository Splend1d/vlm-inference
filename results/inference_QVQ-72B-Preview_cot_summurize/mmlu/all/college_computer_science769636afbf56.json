Mergesort\n\nC. Heapsort\n\nD. Quicksort\"\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to find an algorithm that runs in quadratic time in the worst case but averages linearithmic time.\n\nFirst, I should recall what each of these sorting algorithms does and what their time complexities are.\n\nStarting with Bubblesort: I remember that Bubblesort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. It's pretty straightforward but not very efficient for large lists. Its worst-case and average time complexity is \u0398(n^2). So, it doesn't match the criteria of having \u0398(n log n) on average. It's \u0398(n^2) both in the worst case and on average. So, option A is out.\n\nNext, Mergesort. Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It splits the list into halves, sorts them recursively, and then merges them back together. I think its worst-case time complexity is \u0398(n log n), and the same for the average case. So, it's consistently \u0398(n log n), which doesn't match the required \u0398(n^2) in the worst case and \u0398(n log n) on average. So, option B is probably not the answer.\n\nMoving on to Heapsort. Heapsort is another sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. It builds a heap from the input data and then repeatedly extracts the maximum element to build the sorted list. I believe its worst-case time complexity is also \u0398(n log n), and the same for the average case. Again, this doesn't fit the required criteria. So, option C is likely incorrect.\n\nFinally, Quicksort. Quicksort is also a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. Now, I recall that the performance of Quicksort can vary depending on the choice of the pivot and the data being sorted.\n\nIn the best-case scenario, the pivot divides the array into two equal parts, leading to a time complexity of \u0398(n log n). In the average case, it's also \u0398(n log n). However, in the worst-case scenario, when the pivot is the smallest or largest element, the partition is unbalanced, leading to \u0398(n^2) time complexity.\n\nWait a minute, this seems to match the required criteria. The worst-case is \u0398(n^2), and the average-case is \u0398(n log n). So, option D, Quicksort, seems to fit the description.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. Is there any chance that Quicksort could have a different average-case complexity? I don't think so. It's well-known that Quicksort has an average time complexity of \u0398(n log n) and a worst-case of \u0398(n^2), especially if the pivot is poorly chosen or the data is already sorted or reverse-sorted.\n\nAdditionally, there are variations of Quicksort, like randomized Quicksort, which mitigate the worst-case scenario by choosing the pivot randomly, thus ensuring that the average-case behavior is more commonly achieved.\n\nHowever, the question specifies \"the following algorithms,\" meaning the standard Quicksort algorithm without any modifications. So, I think it's safe to assume that Quicksort has the properties mentioned in the question.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other sorting algorithms that might fit the bill. For example, Insertion Sort has a worst-case time complexity of \u0398(n^2) and an average-case of \u0398(n^2), similar to Bubblesort. So, it doesn't meet the criteria. Selection Sort is the same. Shell Sort is a bit more complex, with varying time complexities based on the gap sequence used, but generally, it's not \u0398(n log n) on average.\n\nRadix Sort and Counting Sort have different time complexities based on the number of digits or the range of input, so they don't fit the specific criteria mentioned.\n\nTherefore, among the given options\u2014Bubblesort, Mergesort, Heapsort, and Quicksort\u2014the one that has a worst-case time complexity of \u0398(n^2) and an average-case time complexity of \u0398(n log n) is Quicksort.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Quicksort.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
