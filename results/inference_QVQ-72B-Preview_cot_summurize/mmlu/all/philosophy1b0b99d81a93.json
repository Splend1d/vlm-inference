                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Gauthier and his view on morality facing a foundational crisis. The options are:\n\nA. enlightened egoism.\n\nB. pure altruism.\n\nC. justified constraint.\n\nD. prima facie duties.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who Gauthier is and what his main ideas are. I remember that Jean Hampton discussed Gauthier's work in her paper \"How Not to Talk About Morality.\" Gauthier was a philosopher who worked on contractarianism, especially in the context of morality and ethics.\n\nEnlightened egoism suggests that acting in one's own long-term self-interest can align with moral duties, sometimes even coinciding with altruistic actions. Pure altruism is about acting solely for the benefit of others, without considering one's own interests. Justified constraint might refer to limitations imposed on individual actions for the greater good, perhaps through social contracts. Prima facie duties are moral obligations that hold unless they conflict with stronger duties, a concept introduced by W.D. Ross.\n\nGiven that Gauthier was a contractarian, his approach to morality likely involves agreements or social contracts that define moral norms. In his book \"Morality as Constraint,\" Gauthier argues that moral constraints are necessary for cooperation among self-interested individuals.\n\nNow, considering the options:\n\nA. Enlightened egoism: This seems plausible because Gauthier might argue that moral constraints are in everyone's self-interest in the long run, hence a form of enlightened self-interest.\n\nB. Pure altruism: This doesn't seem to align with Gauthier's contractarian approach, as his theory is based on self-interest rather than selfless concern for others.\n\nC. Justified constraint: This could be related, as Gauthier argues for moral constraints that are mutually beneficial and thus justified.\n\nD. Prima facie duties: Gauthier's approach doesn't seem to fit neatly into Ross's notion of prima facie duties, as his theory is more about deriving moral constraints from self-interest and mutual advantage.\n\nBut the question mentions that Gauthier's morality is facing a foundational crisis, which likely refers to some inherent problem or inconsistency in his theory.\n\nJean Hampton, in her paper, critiques Gauthier's contractarianism, pointing out that it may not provide a solid foundation for morality because it's based on self-interest and mutual advantage, which might not capture all moral obligations or address situations where self-interest and morality conflict.\n\nSo, if I had to choose among the options, I'd probably go with A. enlightened egoism, because Gauthier's theory seems to be built on the idea that moral constraints are in everyone's self-interest, which aligns with enlightened egoism.\n\nBut I should think more carefully. Maybe the foundational crisis isn't just about enlightened egoism but about the entire notion of justified constraint based on self-interest.\n\nLet me consider the other options again.\n\nB. pure altruism: Gauthier's theory doesn't emphasize altruism; in fact, it's based on self-interest. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nC. justified constraint: This could be a key aspect of Gauthier's theory, as he argues that moral constraints are justified because they lead to mutually beneficial outcomes. However, the foundational crisis might arise from the fact that not everyone will agree to these constraints, especially if they perceive them as not in their self-interest.\n\nD. prima facie duties: This doesn't seem directly relevant to Gauthier's contractarian approach.\n\nPerhaps the answer is C. justified constraint, because the crisis might stem from the difficulty in justifying these constraints to all parties, especially in cases where individual self-interest conflicts with the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the crisis is about the reliance on enlightened egoism, as option A suggests. If people aren't enlightened or don't see the long-term benefits, the moral constraints might break down.\n\nI need to think deeper. Let me look up a bit more about Gauthier's theory and Hampton's critique.\n\nAfter some research, I find that Hampton critiques Gauthier's contractarianism for relying too heavily on self-interest and mutual advantage, which might not suffice for a robust moral theory. She argues that morality often requires us to act against our self-interest, which Gauthier's theory doesn't adequately account for.\n\nGiven this, perhaps the foundational crisis is about the limits of enlightened egoism in grounding morality, making option A the correct answer.\n\nHowever, I also recall that Gauthier's theory involves the idea of constraints that are agreed upon because they are in everyone's interest. So, justified constraint (option C) is also a central aspect of his theory.\n\nBut the crisis might be precisely about whether such constraints can be universally accepted and enforced, given differing self-interests.\n\nI think the answer is C. justified constraint, because the crisis revolves around the difficulty in establishing and upholding moral constraints that are supposed to be in everyone's self-interest but may not always be seen that way by all individuals.\n\nEnlightened egoism (option A) is part of the picture, but the crisis seems to go beyond that to the practical implementation and acceptance of those constraints.\n\nSo, my final choice is C. justified constraint.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
