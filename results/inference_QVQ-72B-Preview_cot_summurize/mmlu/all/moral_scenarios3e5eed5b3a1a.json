                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I cover my eyes when I see starving animals because then I don't have to bother helping.\" Okay, so someone is avoiding looking at starving animals to prevent themselves from feeling obligated to help. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky. On one hand, it's understandable that seeing suffering can be distressing, and maybe the person doesn't know how to help or feels\u65e0\u529b. But on the other hand, turning a blind eye to suffering might not be the most ethical approach.\n\nLet me consider some moral principles here. There's the idea of compassion and helping those in need, especially vulnerable beings like animals. Ignoring suffering when you can help might be seen as callous or indifferent. In many ethical frameworks, having empathy and assisting those who are suffering is considered morally good.\n\nBut maybe the person covering their eyes feels overwhelmed or thinks they can't make a difference. I can understand that feeling, but using that as an excuse to not even try might not be acceptable. It's like the saying, \"The ability to look the other way needs moral justification.\"\n\nSo, in this scenario, covering one's eyes to avoid helping starving animals seems like a morally wrong action because it's a deliberate avoidance of a situation where one could potentially help.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: \"I planted a large garden by the side of the narrow public street.\" Okay, so someone planted a garden on public property, specifically by the side of a narrow street. Hmm, is this morally wrong?\n\nFirst off, planting a garden generally seems like a positive thing\u2014gardens can be beautiful, provide food, and improve air quality. However, the location is important here\u2014it's by the side of a narrow public street. So, there might be some issues related to public safety or local regulations.\n\nIf planting the garden obstructs the street or poses a hazard to drivers or pedestrians, that could be a problem. For example, if the garden is too close to the road and could cause accidents or if it blocks sightlines at intersections, that would be morally irresponsible.\n\nAdditionally, planting on public property without permission might be considered trespassing or vandalism, depending on the jurisdiction. Even if the intentions are good, doing so without proper authorization could be seen as wrong.\n\nBut let's assume that the garden is planted in a way that doesn't obstruct the street or pose any dangers. Maybe it's a beautification project or a community garden. In that case, it might be seen as a positive contribution to the neighborhood.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's hard to make a definitive judgment. If the person planted the garden with good intentions but without considering the potential negative impacts, such as reduced visibility for drivers or damage to existing infrastructure, then it could be seen as morally negligent.\n\nOn the other hand, if they took all necessary precautions and obtained any required permits, then it's likely not morally wrong.\n\nGiven that the question specifies that this is a \"narrow\" public street, which might suggest space constraints, there could be valid concerns about safety and accessibility.\n\nSo, in this scenario, planting a garden by the side of a narrow public street could be morally wrong if it endangers others or disregards community rules and safety regulations.\n\nNow, to answer the question: Which of these two scenarios is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020?\n\nOption A: Both are wrong.\n\nOption B: First is wrong, second is not wrong.\n\nOption C: First is not wrong, second is wrong.\n\nOption D: Neither is wrong.\n\nFrom my analysis, both scenarios have elements that could be considered morally wrong. In the first scenario, covering one's eyes to avoid helping starving animals seems morally wrong because it's a deliberate avoidance of helping those in need. In the second scenario, planting a garden on a narrow public street could be morally wrong if it poses safety risks or violates public property rules.\n\nTherefore, I would choose Option A: Both are wrong.\n\nBut I have to admit, it's a bit nuanced. Depending on the specific circumstances, the second scenario might not be morally wrong if the garden was planted safely and with permission. However, based on the information provided, it seems that both actions could be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, my final answer is A. Wrong, Wrong."
