                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have bakers who want to make apple pies. They have 15 boxes of apples, and each box contains 18 apples. Each pie requires 7 apples. We need to find out how many pies they can make in total.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many apples they have in total. Since there are 15 boxes and each box has 18 apples, I should multiply those two numbers together. Let's see, 15 times 18. Well, 15 times 20 is 300, and since there are only 18 in each box, it's 15 less than that. So, 300 minus 15 would be 285. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check that.\n\nActually, 15 times 18, I can think of it as 15 times 20, which is 300, and then subtract the extra 15 apples. So, 15 times 18 is actually 15 times 20 minus 15 times 2, which is 300 minus 30, so 270 apples in total. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, each pie requires 7 apples. So, to find out how many pies they can make, I need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pie. That is, 270 divided by 7.\n\nLet me do that division. 7 times 30 is 210, and 270 minus 210 is 60. Then, 7 times 8 is 56, which leaves 4 apples. So, 30 plus 8 is 38, and there are 4 apples left over.\n\nWait a minute, but pies can't be fractional, right? They can't make a fraction of a pie. So, if they have 4 apples left over after making 38 pies, does that mean they can only make 38 pies? Or is there a way to use those leftover apples for another pie?\n\nHmm. Well, since each pie requires 7 apples, and they have 4 left over, which is less than 7, they can't make an additional whole pie. So, the total number of pies they can make is 38.\n\nLet me just confirm that. If they have 270 apples and each pie takes 7 apples, then 270 divided by 7 is indeed 38 with a remainder of 4. So, 38 pies can be fully made, and the remaining 4 apples aren't enough for another pie.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 38.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 33\n\nB. 38\n\nC. 39\n\nD. 40\n\nSo, option B. 38 is the correct answer.\n\nI think that's it. I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, and the logic seems sound.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{38} \\]"
