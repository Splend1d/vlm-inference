The sun was gone, but he had left his footprints in the sky. It was the time for sitting on porches beside the road. It was the time to hear things and talk. These sitters had been tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences all day long. Mules and other brutes had occupied their skins. But now, the sun and the bossman were gone, so the skins felt powerful and human. They became lords of sounds and lesser things. They passed nations through their mouths. They sat in judgment. Zora Neale Hurston is associated with which of the following literary movements?\n\nA. New England Puritanism\nB. Transcendentalism\nC. Naturalism\nD. Harlem Renaissance\n"

                    "text": "Alright, I've got this passage from Zora Neale Hurston's \"Their Eyes Were Watching God,\" and I need to figure out which literary movement she's associated with. The options are New England Puritanism, Transcendentalism, Naturalism, and the Harlem Renaissance. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I should probably recall what each of these movements is about. Starting with New England Puritanism, that was a religious and literary movement in the 17th century, focused on strict moral codes and often had a somber, didactic tone. Authors like John Winthrop and Anne Bradstreet come to mind. Doesn't seem like that fits with Hurston, who was writing in the 20th century and had a different focus.\n\nNext, Transcendentalism. That was a philosophical movement in the 19th century, emphasizing individual intuition, nature, and the oversoul. Writers like Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau were key figures. While there might be some overlap in themes, like a connection to nature, I think Transcendentalism is more about individualism and self-reliance, which might not fully capture Hurston's work.\n\nThen there's Naturalism, which came in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It's characterized by a deterministic view of human behavior, often depicting the harsh realities of life, especially for the lower classes. Writers like Jack London and Stephen Crane were known for this style. Again, while there might be some similarities in terms of depicting real-life struggles, I'm not sure if this is the best fit for Hurston.\n\nFinally, the Harlem Renaissance. This was a cultural, social, and artistic movement that flourished in Harlem, New York, during the 1920s and 1930s. It was a time when African American artists, writers, and intellectuals thrived, producing a rich body of work that celebrated black life and culture. Key figures include Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, and Zora Neale Hurston herself.\n\nGiven that, it seems pretty clear that Zora Neale Hurston is associated with the Harlem Renaissance. But just to be sure, let's think about the passage provided. It describes a scene where people gather on porches at sundown to talk and share stories, feeling empowered and human after a day's work. There's a sense of community and the passing down of knowledge through oral tradition, which is a significant aspect of African American culture and the Harlem Renaissance.\n\nThe language is poetic and evocative, capturing the beauty and significance of these moments of connection and reflection. This aligns with the Harlem Renaissance's emphasis on celebrating African American experiences and culture through art and literature.\n\nSo, considering both the historical context and the content of the passage, I'm confident that the correct answer is D. Harlem Renaissance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
