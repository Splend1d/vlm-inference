The options are A. Structuralists, B. Ethologists, C. Sociobiologists, D. Anthropologists.\"\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which group of scientists first argued that how people think is mostly influenced by the cultural values and ideas around them. I'm not super familiar with all these terms, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these terms means:\n\n- **Structuralists:** I think structuralism is a theory in psychology that tries to break down mental processes into basic components. But I'm not sure if that's directly related to cultural influences on thinking.\n\n- **Ethologists:** Ethology is the study of animal behavior in natural environments. It seems more focused on animals than human cultural values.\n\n- **Sociobiologists:** This field combines sociology and biology to understand social behaviors, often in animals, but sometimes in humans. It might touch on cultural aspects, but I think it's more about biological bases of social behavior.\n\n- **Anthropologists:** Anthropology is the study of humans in their cultural, social, biological, and linguistic aspects. Cultural anthropology specifically looks at cultural differences and similarities among human societies.\n\nGiven that, it seems like anthropologists, especially cultural anthropologists, would be the ones most likely to focus on how cultural values and ideas shape an individual's ways of thinking.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about the history of these fields.\n\nStructuralism was a school of thought in psychology founded by Wilhelm Wundt, which aimed to understand the structure of the mind by breaking down mental processes into basic elements. While it did contribute to understanding mental processes, it wasn't particularly focused on cultural influences.\n\nEthology, developed by scientists like Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen, focuses on animal behavior in natural settings, emphasizing innate behaviors and instincts. It's more about biological rather than cultural influences.\n\nSociobiology, a term coined by Edward O. Wilson, seeks to explain social behaviors in terms of natural selection and evolutionary theory. While it can include human behavior, its primary focus isn't on cultural values shaping individual thinking.\n\nAnthropology, on the other hand, has a long history of studying culture's impact on human behavior and thought processes. Cultural anthropology, in particular, examines how cultural systems shape perceptions, values, and behaviors.\n\nMoreover, anthropologists like Franz Boas and Ruth Benedict emphasized the role of culture in shaping human behavior and thought, arguing against innate determinism.\n\nWait a minute, Boas was known for his work in cultural relativism, which posits that cultural beliefs and practices should be understood within their own particular contexts, not judged against some universal standard. This perspective aligns well with the idea that an individual's ways of thinking are shaped primarily by cultural values and ideas.\n\nAlso, Benedict's book \"Patterns of Culture\" explored how different cultures foster different patterns of thinking and behavior, which further supports this notion.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that anthropologists were among the first to strongly advocate for the idea that cultural values and ideas primarily shape individual thinking.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if any of the other fields had similar leanings around the same time.\n\nStructuralism was prominent in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but its focus was more on the structure of the mind and sensory experiences, not specifically on cultural influences.\n\nEthology emerged in the mid-20th century and was primarily concerned with animal behavior, not human cultural influences.\n\nSociobiology also emerged in the 20th century, with Wilson's book \"Sociobiology: The New Synthesis\" published in 1975, which again focuses more on biological foundations of social behavior.\n\nAnthropology, especially cultural anthropology, has been active since the late 19th century, with Boas and others making significant contributions to the understanding of culture's impact on human behavior and thought.\n\nTherefore, it appears that anthropologists were indeed the first to contend that an individual's ways of thinking are shaped primarily by cultural values and ideas.\n\nWait, but I should check if there were any earlier thinkers outside of anthropology who might have had similar ideas.\n\nFor example, philosophers and sociologists have also discussed the influence of culture on individual thought and behavior. Thinkers like Emile Durkheim in sociology emphasized the role of society and culture in shaping individual actions.\n\nHowever, Durkheim's work, while influential, was more focused on social facts and the integration of individuals into society, rather than specifically on how cultural values shape thinking processes.\n\nMoreover, anthropologists like Boas and Benedict were more explicitly focused on the diversity of cultural expressions and how they mold individual perceptions and thoughts.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, anthropologists were among the first to conduct extensive fieldwork in different cultural settings, observing firsthand how cultural contexts influence individual behavior and thought.\n\nThis empirical approach gave their theories a solid foundation, making their arguments about cultural shaping of thought particularly convincing.\n\nAdditionally, anthropologists developed concepts like enculturation, which describes the process by which individuals learn and internalize the cultural values and norms of their society.\n\nThis process directly relates to how an individual's ways of thinking are shaped by cultural values and ideas.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems clear that anthropologists were the first to contend that cultural values and ideas primarily shape individual thinking.\n\nTo wrap it up, based on the historical development of these fields and the specific focus of anthropologists on cultural influences on human behavior and thought, the answer should be D. Anthropologists.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
