                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the doctrine of original intent. I need to pick which option best articulates that doctrine. Let me see what each option says.\n\nOption A says: When a law is unclear, the Supreme Court may consider the intent of a law or the letter of the law, but not both.\n\nHmm, that sounds like it's talking about how the Supreme Court interprets laws. It suggests that when a law isn't clear, the Court can choose to look at what the law was intended to do or at the exact words of the law, but not both at the same time. But is that really what original intent is about?\n\nOption B says: Copyright laws exist to protect the rights of those who create original works.\n\nThis seems to be more about the purpose of copyright laws, not specifically about the doctrine of original intent. It's explaining why copyright laws are there\u2014to protect creators' rights. That doesn't seem directly related to original intent in the context of interpreting the Constitution or laws.\n\nOption C says: Appellate judges should respect the original decisions of trial judges.\n\nThis one is about appellate judges respecting the decisions made by trial judges. It's more about the relationship between different levels of courts and the principle of deference to trial court findings. Again, not directly about original intent.\n\nOption D says: The Constitution should be interpreted in light of the intent of those who wrote it.\n\nThis seems the most straightforward. It's saying that when interpreting the Constitution, we should consider what the people who wrote it\u2014the Founding Fathers\u2014intended it to mean. This aligns pretty closely with the concept of original intent, which is a principle in constitutional interpretation that suggests we should adhere to the understanding of the Constitution held by those who drafted and ratified it.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, Option D seems to be the best fit for articulating the doctrine of original intent. The other options are more about general legal principles or the roles of different types of judges, whereas Option D specifically addresses how the Constitution should be interpreted based on the intentions of its authors.\n\nI think the answer is D. The Constitution should be interpreted in light of the intent of those who wrote it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
