The botanist Dmitri Iwanowsky\n\nD. The virologist Jonas Salk\n\nI need to recall which one of these scientists discovered the first virus.\n\nFirst, I should remember that viruses are tiny infectious agents that replicate only inside the living cells of an organism. They were discovered before the development of microscopes that could see them directly, so it must have been through indirect methods.\n\nLet me think about Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. He was a Dutch businessman and scientist who is often referred to as the \"father of microbiology.\" He invented one of the first microscopes and used it to observe and describe microorganisms, such as bacteria and protozoa. However, I don't recall him discovering viruses. Maybe he focused more on larger microorganisms.\n\nNext, Charles Chamberland was a French bacteriologist who worked closely with Louis Pasteur. He is known for developing the first efficient filter to remove bacteria from liquids, which became known as the Chamberland filter. This was important in the study of microbes, but I don't think he discovered the first virus. Perhaps his work helped in the discovery of viruses by allowing the passage of smaller particles that could still cause disease.\n\nDmitri Iwanowsky was a Russian botanist who made significant contributions to the field of virology. He is often credited with the discovery of the first virus, specifically the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), which affects tobacco plants. I think he did this in the late 19th century, around 1892. His work involved passing plant sap through filters that retained bacteria but still transmitted the disease, suggesting that something smaller than bacteria was causing it.\n\nJonas Salk was an American medical researcher who developed the first effective polio vaccine. While his work was groundbreaking in virology and public health, it came much later, in the 1950s. So, he wasn't the one who discovered the first virus.\n\nBased on this, it seems that Dmitri Iwanowsky was the first to discover a virus, specifically the tobacco mosaic virus. Therefore, the correct answer should be C. The botanist Dmitri Iwanowsky.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check my memory. I recall that Iwanowsky's experiment with tobacco plants showed that the infectious agent could pass through filters that bacteria couldn't, and it could also pass through cell membranes. This led him to propose that the agent was not a living organism but something like a toxin, though he didn't fully understand its nature. Later, it was recognized as a virus.\n\nSo, yes, I'm confident that Dmitri Iwanowsky was the first to discover a virus, even if he didn't fully understand what it was at the time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
