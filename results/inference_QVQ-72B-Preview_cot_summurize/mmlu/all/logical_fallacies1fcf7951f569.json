I'm not super familiar with this particular fallacy, but I've heard of a few others like ad hominem or straw man, so maybe this is similar in some way.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"appeal to spite\" means. Spite is like a feeling of resentment or a desire to harm someone who has wronged you, right? So, appealing to spite probably involves using someone's negative emotions or grudges as a way to argue a point or make a decision.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: responding to an argument with an expression of derision instead of a counter argument. Derision means mocking or ridiculing, right? So, this seems more like a personal attack or dismissive response rather than directly appealing to spite. Maybe it's related, but it doesn't seem to be directly about spite.\n\nOption B: arguing against a position based only on negative personal feelings toward the position. This sounds like a general emotional appeal, where someone's dislike for something influences their argument against it, regardless of actual evidence or logic. Again, it's about personal feelings, but not specifically about spite or resentment towards a person.\n\nOption C: arguing someone should do something only because that person dislikes someone else. Hmm, this seems closer to the idea of spite. It's suggesting that someone's actions are motivated by their desire to upset or frustrate another person they don't like. So, it's using their negative feelings towards someone else as a reason to do something, which could be seen as an appeal to spite.\n\nOption D: saying someone shouldn't do something because if he or she does it, people won't like him or her. This seems more like an appeal to popularity or social acceptance. It's about avoiding disapproval from others, not necessarily about harming someone out of resentment.\n\nBased on this, option C seems to be the best fit for the fallacy of appeal to spite. It directly involves using someone's dislike for another person as a reason to take a particular action, which aligns with the concept of spite.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think of an example. Suppose someone says, \"You should support this policy because you know our rival opposes it. If we implement it, it will really annoy them.\" This seems like an appeal to spite because the argument is based on the desire to frustrate or harm someone else out of resentment, rather than on the merits of the policy itself.\n\nComparing that to the other options, option A is about responding with mockery instead of a substantive counterargument, which is different. Option B is about arguing against something based on negative feelings, but not specifically directed at harming someone else. Option D is about avoiding actions that would lead to disapproval, which is more about seeking approval or avoiding disfavor, not about harming someone out of spite.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I think option C is the correct description of the fallacy of appeal to spite. It captures the essence of using someone's desire to harm or upset another person as a justification for an action, which is at the core of this fallacy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
