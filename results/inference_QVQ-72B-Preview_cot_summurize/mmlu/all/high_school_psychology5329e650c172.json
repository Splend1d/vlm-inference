                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these options best describes the technique Coach Perry is using to train Lana as a goalie. Let's see, he starts by rolling the ball slowly to her and then gradually makes it faster and directs it to different parts of the goal, all while praising her when she successfully stops the ball. Hmm, this sounds like a method where he's building up her skills step by step, making it a bit harder each time she succeeds.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. The law of effect. I remember that this is a principle in psychology that suggests behaviors followed by positive outcomes are more likely to be repeated, and those followed by negative outcomes are less likely to be repeated. So, praising Lana when she stops the ball could be seen as a positive outcome, reinforcing her behavior. But is this the main technique being used here? I'm not sure if it's the best fit because the law of effect is more about the consequence affecting the likelihood of the behavior, not necessarily shaping the behavior step by step.\n\nB. The partial reinforcement effect. This has to do with reinforcement schedules, where reinforcement is only provided sometimes, not every time the desired behavior occurs. I don't think this matches what's happening here. Coach Perry is praising Lana when she succeeds, which seems more like continuous reinforcement at this stage since he's praising her every time she stops the ball successfully. Maybe as training progresses, he might praise her less frequently, but for now, it seems like he's reinforcing her successes consistently.\n\nC. Shaping. This sounds promising. Shaping is a technique in operant conditioning where you reinforce successive approximations of a desired behavior. You start with a behavior that's close to what you want and reinforce that, then gradually require closer approximations until the desired behavior is reached. In this case, Coach Perry starts with slow rolls and praises Lana when she stops them. Then he makes it a bit harder by rolling faster and to different parts of the goal, still praising her successes. This seems like he's reinforcing her progress step by step, shaping her skills to handle faster and more varied rolls.\n\nD. Second-order conditioning. This has to do with classical conditioning, where after a stimulus is paired with a reinforcer, the stimulus itself can become a reinforcer. For example, if a bell is rung before food is given to a dog, the bell eventually becomes a conditioned stimulus that can elicit the same response as the food (salivation). I don't see a clear connection to second-order conditioning in this scenario. Coach Perry is directly reinforcing Lana's actions with praise, not using a conditioned stimulus as a reinforcer.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, it seems like option C, shaping, is the most appropriate description of Coach Perry's technique. He's gradually guiding Lana's skills towards the desired level by reinforcing closer and closer approximations of the final behavior.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In shaping, typically, you have a behavior that you want to train, and you reinforce the closest attempts the subject makes towards that behavior. For example, if you want to teach a dog to jump over a hurdle, you might start by reinforcing any jump, then make the hurdle higher and only reinforce jumps over the higher hurdle, and so on. Similarly, in this case, Coach Perry is starting with easy rolls and reinforcing Lana's ability to stop them, then making the rolls harder by increasing speed and varying direction, still reinforcing her when she succeeds.\n\nYes, that fits perfectly with the concept of shaping. It's a common technique in behavior modification and training, where you break down a complex behavior into smaller, manageable steps and reinforce each step until the full behavior is achieved.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. Shaping is indeed the technique Coach Perry is using to train Lana as a goalie.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. shaping}} \\]"
