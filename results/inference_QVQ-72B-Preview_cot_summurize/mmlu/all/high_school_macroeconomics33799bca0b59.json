                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about aggregate demand and aggregate supply curves. It's been a while since I've studied macroeconomics, but I'll try to work through this step by step.\n\nSo, the question is: If the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right, what will happen to the equilibrium price level and the equilibrium quantity of output, assuming a Classical aggregate supply curve?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\n\nB. The equilibrium price level decreases while the equilibrium quantity of output increases.\n\nC. The equilibrium price level and quantity of output increase.\n\nD. The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output remains unchanged.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the aggregate demand (AD) and aggregate supply (AS) curves represent. Aggregate demand is the total demand for goods and services in an economy at a given price level. The aggregate supply curve shows the total amount of goods and services that firms in an economy are willing to produce at a given price level.\n\nNow, the question mentions a Classical aggregate supply curve. From what I remember, Classical economics assumes that markets adjust quickly to equilibrium, and the economy naturally tends towards full employment. In this framework, the aggregate supply curve is vertical at the full employment level of output. That means, regardless of the price level, the quantity of output supplied is constant at the full employment level.\n\nSo, if the AS curve is vertical, that implies that changes in the price level don't affect the quantity of output supplied. That's a key point.\n\nNow, if the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right, that means there's an increase in total demand in the economy at every price level. This could be due to various factors, such as an increase in consumer confidence, higher government spending, or an increase in the money supply.\n\nGiven that the AS curve is vertical, what happens when AD shifts to the right? Well, since the AS curve doesn't move, the equilibrium quantity of output should remain the same, right? Because the AS curve is fixed at the full employment level.\n\nBut wait, if AD increases and AS is vertical, then the price level should increase because the quantity supplied doesn't change to meet the increased demand.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the equilibrium price level increases, but the quantity of output stays the same.\n\nThat would point to option D: The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output remains unchanged.\n\nBut let me double-check this understanding. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nI recall that in the Keynesian model, the AS curve can have different shapes, like horizontal or upward-sloping, depending on the level of output. But in this question, it specifies a Classical aggregate supply curve, which should be vertical.\n\nSo, if AD shifts rightward, and AS is vertical, the quantity of output doesn't change; only the price level increases. That makes sense to me.\n\nLet me consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A says that the price level increases while the quantity decreases. But if AS is vertical, the quantity shouldn't decrease; it should stay the same. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nOption B says that the price level decreases while the quantity increases. But if AD increases, and AS is vertical, I would expect the price level to increase, not decrease, and the quantity to remain the same, not increase.\n\nOption C says that both the price level and quantity increase. But again, with a vertical AS curve, the quantity should not change; it's fixed at the full employment level.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be option D: The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output remains unchanged.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll think about the determinants of AD and AS.\n\nFactors that can shift the AD curve include changes in consumer spending, investment, government spending, taxes, net exports, and the money supply.\n\nThe AS curve, in the Classical model, is vertical because wages and prices are assumed to be flexible, and the economy always operates at its potential output or full employment level.\n\nTherefore, any increase in AD will only lead to higher prices, not to an increase in output, since the AS curve is fixed.\n\nThis reinforces my initial conclusion that option D is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. If I'm missing something, perhaps it's a trick question, but based on standard macroeconomic principles, option D seems right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
