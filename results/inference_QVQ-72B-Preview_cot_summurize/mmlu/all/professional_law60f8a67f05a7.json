After missing two practices, the football player was dropped from the team by the head football coach.

He asked to rejoin, but the coach said no, and in fact, told him that everyone hates him and hopes he transfers. The player felt really down after that, wrote a suicide note saying the coach is responsible for his despondency, and then took a bunch of pills. His roommate found him, read the note, and rushed him to the first aid center, where he recovered.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the football player can successfully claim that the coach intentionally inflicted emotional distress on him. There are four options:\n\nA. Prevail, because the coach intended to cause him to suffer emotional distress.\n\nB. Prevail, because the coach's remark did, in fact, cause the football player to suffer emotional distress.\n\nC. Not prevail, because the football player's drug overdose resulted from his own voluntary act.\n\nD. Not prevail, because the coach acted reasonably under the circumstances, since everyone on the team hated the football player.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what \"intentional infliction of emotional distress\" means. I think it's when someone does something on purpose to cause another person severe emotional distress. There are usually elements to this tort, like the conduct has to be extreme and outrageous, intentional or reckless, and it has to cause severe emotional distress.\n\nSo, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, was the coach's behavior extreme and outrageous? The coach told the player he was despised by the team and under no circumstances could he return, and then added that everyone hates his guts and hopes he transfers. That sounds pretty harsh and could be considered outrageous, especially since the player had only missed two practices.\n\nSecond, was the coach intentional or reckless? The coach deliberately said these things to the player, knowing they would be hurtful. So, yes, it was intentional.\n\nThird, did it cause severe emotional distress? The player wrote a suicide note and tried to kill himself, which is definitely severe emotional distress.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like the elements are there for the player to prevail.\n\nBut wait, there's option C, which says he might not prevail because the drug overdose was his own voluntary act. That's an interesting point. Maybe the coach didn't force him to take the pills; it was his own decision. But, on the other hand, the coach's actions led him to feel so distressed that he attempted suicide.\n\nI think there's a causal connection between the coach's words and the player's actions. The player wrote in his note that the coach was responsible for his despondency, indicating that he felt the coach's actions drove him to that point.\n\nOption D says the coach acted reasonably because everyone hated the player. Well, just because others hated him doesn't make the coach's actions reasonable. In fact, it might make them worse, as the coach is reinforcing a hostile environment.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the player would prevail. But let me think again.\n\nIn tort law, for intentional infliction of emotional distress, the conduct has to be beyond all possible bounds of decency, and no reasonable person could consider it justified under the circumstances.\n\nThe coach's remarks were certainly harsh and could be seen as beyond bounds of decency, especially since the player had only missed two practices.\n\nAlso, the coach knew or should have known that his words could cause severe emotional distress. The fact that the player attempted suicide shows the severity of the distress caused.\n\nHowever, maybe the coach didn't intend for the player to attempt suicide; he just wanted to make sure the player left the team.\n\nBut in law, intent can be to cause some harm, and the severe emotional distress is a foreseeable result of that harm.\n\nSo, even if the coach didn't specifically intend for the player to attempt suicide, he intended to cause harm through his words, and the severe emotional distress was a foreseeable result.\n\nTherefore, I think options A and B are both partially correct, but option C is not, because the player's voluntary act was a direct result of the coach's actions.\n\nOption D is definitely incorrect because reasonableness isn't determined by the fact that everyone hated the player.\n\nSo, between A and B, which one is better?\n\nOption A says the coach intended to cause him to suffer emotional distress.\n\nOption B says the coach's remark did, in fact, cause the football player to suffer emotional distress.\n\nI think both are true, but in legal terms, for intentional infliction, it's about whether the defendant intended to cause the emotional distress, not just that their actions caused it.\n\nSo, option A seems more accurate because it specifies the intent to cause emotional distress.\n\nOption B just says the remark caused the distress, but doesn't specify the intent.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A: prevail, because the coach intended to cause him to suffer emotional distress.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because maybe the coach didn't specifically intend to cause emotional distress, just to make sure the player left the team.\n\nHowever, in law, if the intent is to cause some harm, and emotional distress is a foreseeable result, it can be considered intentional infliction.\n\nSo, yeah, I think A is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
