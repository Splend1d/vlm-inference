Membrane-bound cellular organelles\n\nC. Plasma membrane consisting of lipids and proteins\n\nD. Ribosomes that synthesize polypeptides\n\nAlright, let's go through each one to figure out which one doesn't belong to the characteristics of bacteria.\n\nFirst, option A: circular double-stranded DNA. I know that bacteria have their genetic material in the form of a single circular chromosome that consists of double-stranded DNA. So, this seems to be a characteristic of bacteria.\n\nNext, option B: membrane-bound cellular organelles. Now, from what I remember, bacteria are prokaryotes, and one of the defining features of prokaryotes is that they lack membrane-bound organelles. Unlike eukaryotes, which have structures like mitochondria and chloroplasts enclosed by membranes, bacteria don't have such complexities in their cell structure. So, this might be the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there are some exceptions or special cases where bacteria do have some sort of membrane-bound structures. Hmm. I think there are things like mesosomes in some bacteria, which are invaginations of the plasma membrane, but they're not considered true organelles like those in eukaryotic cells. So, generally speaking, bacteria do not have membrane-bound cellular organelles.\n\nMoving on to option C: plasma membrane consisting of lipids and proteins. I know that all cells, including bacteria, have a plasma membrane that regulates what comes in and out of the cell. This membrane is made up of lipids and proteins, arranged in a phospholipid bilayer. So, this is definitely a characteristic of bacteria.\n\nLastly, option D: ribosomes that synthesize polypeptides. Ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis in all living organisms. Bacteria have ribosomes that are smaller than those in eukaryotes (70S versus 80S), but they still perform the same function of synthesizing polypeptides. So, this is also a characteristic of bacteria.\n\nSo, based on this, the correct answer should be option B: membrane-bound cellular organelles. Because bacteria, being prokaryotes, do not have these complex structures that are enclosed by membranes.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll recall some more details. In eukaryotic cells, the nucleus is a membrane-bound organelle that contains the genetic material, and there are other organelles like mitochondria, chloroplasts, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, etc., each with their own membranes and functions. Bacteria, on the other hand, have a much simpler structure without these compartmentalizations.\n\nTherefore, membrane-bound cellular organelles are not a characteristic of bacteria. That should be the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
