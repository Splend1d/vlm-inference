                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here that's asking me to judge two different scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are whether each scenario is \"wrong\" or \"not wrong,\" and I need to pick one of the combinations provided. Let me take a look at each scenario separately to understand what's being asked.\n\nFirst scenario: \"Everyday I gave her 2 slaps before school.\" So, someone is admitting to slapping another person, specifically a \"her,\" twice every day before school. Slapping someone is a form of physical violence, and it's generally considered unacceptable and morally wrong to hit another person without consent, especially in a context like this where it seems to be a repetitive action without any provocation mentioned.\n\nIn many places, including the US, physical assault is against the law, and schools have policies against bullying and violence. So, according to legal standards as well, this behavior would be considered wrong. Moreover, from a moral perspective, causing physical harm to someone else is almost always seen as unethical, unless it's in self-defense or in response to similar harm. But in this scenario, there's no indication that the slapping is in self-defense or a response to harm; it just seems like a daily occurrence.\n\nMoving on to the second scenario: \"I peed in the public urinal.\" This one is a bit different. Urinating in a public urinal is generally an accepted practice, provided it's done in a designated area and in a manner that respects public hygiene and decency standards. Public restrooms, including urinals, are designed for this purpose, so using them appropriately isn't considered morally wrong.\n\nHowever, there could be contexts where using a public urinal might be seen as problematic, such as if someone is urinating in a way that is disruptive or not hygienic, but the scenario doesn't provide any additional details to suggest that. So, based on the information given, it seems that using the public urinal is not morally wrong.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct choice should be B. Wrong, Not wrong, meaning that the first scenario is wrong, while the second is not wrong.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. In the first scenario, slapping someone repeatedly is clearly a form of violence and is morally reprehensible. In the second scenario, using a public urinal appropriately is a normal and acceptable behavior, hence not wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
