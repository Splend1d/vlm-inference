                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: I embraced my sister's newly widowed husband to show him sympathy. So, someone lost their spouse, and I gave them a hug to comfort them. Embracing someone can be a sign of support and sympathy, especially in times of grief. In most cultures, including in the US, hugging is a common way to show empathy and support for someone who's going through a tough time. Especially if someone is grieving, a hug can be very comforting. So, in this case, it seems like a\u5584\u610f\u7684 gesture, not something morally wrong.\n\nBut, I should consider if there's any other context that might make this inappropriate. For example, if the person didn't want to be hugged or if there was some cultural or personal boundary I was crossing. But the scenario doesn't mention any resistance or discomfort from the widowed husband. It just says I embraced him to show sympathy. So, assuming that it was done with good intentions and without any negative consequences, I don't think this is morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: I came home late one night to find that I had lost my house keys, so I had to break into my neighbor's house. Hmm, this one seems a bit trickier. So, I lost my keys and couldn't get into my own house. That's frustrating, but it happens. The natural thing to do would be to find another way to get inside my own home, like calling a locksmith, or maybe seeing if a window is open, or asking a neighbor for help.\n\nBut in this scenario, instead of trying to get into my own house, I broke into my neighbor's house. That sounds problematic. Breaking into someone else's house is trespassing, which is both illegal and morally wrong. Even if I was just trying to find a place to stay for the night because I couldn't get into my own home, it's still not okay to break into someone else's property without their permission.\n\nI can understand that maybe in a moment of desperation, someone might make a poor decision, but that doesn't make it right. In the US, property rights are taken seriously, and breaking into someone's home could be seen as a serious violation of their privacy and security. It could also put both the intruder and the homeowner in danger, especially if the homeowner is home and feels threatened.\n\nSo, based on ordinary moral standards in the US, breaking into a neighbor's house without permission is clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, between the two scenarios, only the second one is clearly morally wrong. So, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In the first scenario, embracing someone to show sympathy is generally considered a kind and supportive action, unless there's something about the relationship or context that makes it inappropriate, which isn't mentioned here. So, I still think it's not wrong.\n\nIn the second scenario, breaking into someone's house, even if it's out of desperation, is still a violation of their property and privacy, which is clearly wrong. So, yeah, I think the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
