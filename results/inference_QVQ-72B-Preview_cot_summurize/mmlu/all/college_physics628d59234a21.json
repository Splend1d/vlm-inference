                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about special relativity. There's a meter stick moving past an observer at a speed of 0.8 times the speed of light, which is 0.8c. The question is, in the observer's reference frame, how long does it take for the stick to pass the observer? And there are some options provided: A. 1.6 ns, B. 2.5 ns, C. 4.2 ns, D. 6.9 ns.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall some concepts from special relativity. Since the meter stick is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, relativistic effects are going to come into play here. Specifically, there might be length contraction involved because the stick is moving relative to the observer.\n\nSo, length contraction tells us that when an object is moving at a high speed relative to an observer, its measured length along the direction of motion decreases. The formula for the length observed (l) is l = l\u2080 / \u03b3, where l\u2080 is the proper length (the length in its rest frame), and \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, which is \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nGiven that the stick is moving at 0.8c, I can calculate \u03b3:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64) = 1 / sqrt(0.36) = 1 / 0.6 = 5/3 \u2248 1.666...\n\nSo, the observed length of the stick would be l = 1 meter / 1.666... \u2248 0.6 meters.\n\nBut wait, I need to be careful here. Is the observed length the one that's contracted or not? Actually, from the observer's perspective, the moving stick appears shorter, so the observed length is less than the proper length. So, yes, l = l\u2080 / \u03b3 = 1 / (5/3) = 0.6 meters.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the time it takes for the stick to pass the observer. So, if the stick is moving at 0.8c, and its observed length is 0.6 meters, then the time t should be the observed length divided by the speed.\n\nt = l / v = 0.6 meters / 0.8c = 0.6 / (0.8 * 3.00 x 10^8) seconds, since c is approximately 3.00 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nt = 0.6 / (0.8 * 3.00 x 10^8) = 0.6 / 2.4 x 10^8 = 0.0025 x 10^-6 seconds = 2.5 ns.\n\nOh, so according to this calculation, the time is 2.5 nanoseconds, which corresponds to option B.\n\nBut wait a minute, I should double-check if there's any other relativistic effect that I need to consider here. For example, is there any time dilation that I should account for?\n\nWell, time dilation relates to the perception of time passing in different frames, but in this case, I'm just looking at the time it takes for the stick to pass the observer, based on the observed length and the relative speed. So, I think using the observed length and the speed should give me the correct time in the observer's frame.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this, maybe using the concept of proper time or something else, but I think this is straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the time dilation formula, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here. The time dilation formula is t = \u03c4 * \u03b3, where \u03c4 is the proper time, and \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. But in this scenario, I'm not dealing with a time interval measured in two different frames directly.\n\nI think my initial approach is correct. The observed length is 0.6 meters, and the relative speed is 0.8c, so the time is indeed 0.6 / 0.8c = 2.5 ns.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 2.5 ns seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let's see if perhaps I need to consider the relativistic addition of velocities or something like that. But no, in this case, since the stick is moving past the observer in a straight line, and we're dealing with the length contraction along that direction, my initial calculation should hold.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the stick's length in the observer's frame and then divide by the speed to get the time. So, yes, that seems consistent.\n\nI don't think I'm missing any other relativistic effects here. So, I'm confident that the correct answer is 2.5 ns, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
