                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. Roslyn has twenty boxes in total. Out of these, thirteen boxes contain pencils, nine contain pens, and three contain neither pens nor pencils. The question is asking for the number of boxes that contain both pens and pencils.\n\nAlright, let's try to make sense of this. I think this is a problem where we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. That's a common approach when dealing with counts of categories that overlap.\n\nSo, first, I know that the total number of boxes is twenty. Among these, thirteen contain pencils, nine contain pens, and three contain neither. So, the boxes that contain neither pens nor pencils are three, which means that the boxes that contain either pencils or pens or both should be twenty minus three, right? So, that would be seventeen boxes.\n\nNow, if I add the boxes that contain pencils and the boxes that contain pens, that's thirteen plus nine, which is twenty-two. But this number is larger than the total boxes that contain either pencils or pens or both, which is seventeen. This overlap suggests that some boxes contain both pencils and pens.\n\nTo find the number of boxes that contain both, I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle. The formula for the union of two sets is:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\nIn this case, A is the set of boxes with pencils, and B is the set of boxes with pens. So, |A \u222a B| is the number of boxes that have either pencils or pens or both, which we've determined is seventeen. |A| is thirteen, and |B| is nine.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n17 = 13 + 9 - |A \u2229 B|\n\nSolving for |A \u2229 B|:\n\n17 = 22 - |A \u2229 B|\n\nLet me rearrange that:\n\n|A \u2229 B| = 22 - 17\n\n|A \u2229 B| = 5\n\nSo, there are five boxes that contain both pens and pencils.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I'll try another approach to ensure I'm not missing something.\n\nLet's consider all twenty boxes again:\n\n- 13 boxes have pencils\n\n- 9 boxes have pens\n\n- 3 boxes have neither\n\nIf I add the boxes with pencils and pens, that's 13 + 9 = 22, but since there are only 17 boxes that have either pencils or pens or both (because 20 total boxes - 3 with neither = 17), the overlap must be 22 - 17 = 5.\n\nYeah, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of Venn diagrams. If I draw two circles representing pencils and pens, the overlap area would represent boxes that contain both. The number outside both circles would be the boxes with neither, which is three, so the rest, seventeen boxes, are inside the two circles.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is five boxes contain both pens and pencils.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way to look at this. Maybe using the formula for conditional probability or something, but I think the inclusion-exclusion principle is sufficient here.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation. Let\u2019s denote:\n\n- P: boxes with pencils\n\n- Pe: boxes with pens\n\n- N: boxes with neither\n\nWe know:\n\n- P = 13\n\n- Pe = 9\n\n- N = 3\n\nAnd we know that P + Pe - P \u2229 Pe + N = total boxes\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n13 + 9 - P \u2229 Pe + 3 = 20\n\nSolving for P \u2229 Pe:\n\n25 - P \u2229 Pe = 20\n\nP \u2229 Pe = 5\n\nOkay, this matches what I got earlier. So, it's consistent.\n\nIs there any other aspect I should consider? Maybe checking if the numbers make sense in terms of percentages or something, but I don't think that's necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the boxes that have only pencils and only pens.\n\nSo, boxes with only pencils would be those that have pencils but not pens. Similarly, boxes with only pens would have pens but not pencils.\n\nSo, only pencils: P - P \u2229 Pe = 13 - 5 = 8\n\nOnly pens: Pe - P \u2229 Pe = 9 - 5 = 4\n\nAnd both: 5\n\nSo, total boxes with pencils or pens or both: 8 (only pencils) + 4 (only pens) + 5 (both) = 17, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nThis is just another way to confirm that the number is indeed five.\n\nI think I've approached this from multiple angles and consistently arrived at the same answer. Unless there's some trick in the wording of the problem, I don't see a reason to doubt it.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nA. 5\n\nB. 2\n\nC. 13\n\nD. 139\n\nGiven that, option A is 5, which seems correct based on my calculations.\n\nWait, but option D is 139, which is way larger than the total number of boxes, so that can't be right. Maybe it's a typo or something, but I'll assume it's not relevant.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the number of boxes that contain both pens and pencils is five.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
