                    "text": "So I have this problem here: I need to find the price of a three-year bond with a face value of $100. It pays 5% coupons, and the yield is 6%. The options are $100, $104.29, $96.71, and $97.33.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a bond is. A bond is like a loan that I give to a company or government, and they promise to pay me back the principal amount (face value) plus some interest payments over time. In this case, the face value is $100, and it pays 5% coupons annually.\n\nSo, each year, the bond will pay 5% of $100, which is $5 in coupon payments.\n\nThe yield is the annual return that the bond is expected to pay based on its current market price. Here, the yield is 6%. I think the yield is like the discount rate that I need to use to calculate the present value of the future cash flows from the bond.\n\nSo, to find the price of the bond, I need to calculate the present value of the coupon payments and the present value of the face value, both discounted at the yield rate of 6%.\n\nLet me write that down.\n\nThe cash flows are:\n\n- Year 1: $5 (coupon)\n\n- Year 2: $5 (coupon)\n\n- Year 3: $5 (coupon) + $100 (face value) = $105\n\nSo, total cash flows are $5 in year 1, $5 in year 2, and $105 in year 3.\n\nNow, to find the present value of these cash flows, I need to discount each one back to today using the yield rate of 6%.\n\nThe formula for the present value (PV) of a future cash flow is:\n\nPV = CF / (1 + r)^t\n\nWhere:\n\n- CF is the cash flow in a given period\n\n- r is the yield rate (6% or 0.06)\n\n- t is the time in years\n\nSo, for each year:\n\nPV1 = $5 / (1 + 0.06)^1 = $5 / 1.06 = $4.72\n\nPV2 = $5 / (1 + 0.06)^2 = $5 / 1.1236 \u2248 $4.45\n\nPV3 = $105 / (1 + 0.06)^3 = $105 / 1.191016 \u2248 $88.19\n\nNow, I need to sum these present values to get the total price of the bond.\n\nPrice = PV1 + PV2 + PV3 \u2248 $4.72 + $4.45 + $88.19 \u2248 $97.36\n\nLooking at the options, the closest one is $97.33, which is option D.\n\nBut I got $97.36, which is slightly higher than $97.33. Maybe it's due to rounding differences.\n\nLet me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + 0.06)^1 = 1.06\n\nThen, $5 / 1.06 = $4.716981132, which rounds to approximately $4.72\n\nNext, (1 + 0.06)^2 = 1.1236\n\n$5 / 1.1236 = $4.45\n\nThen, (1 + 0.06)^3 = 1.191016\n\n$105 / 1.191016 = $88.19\n\nSum: $4.72 + $4.45 + $88.19 = $97.36\n\nYes, that seems correct. The difference might be due to rounding during intermediate steps, but since the question doesn't specify the number of decimal places to use, $97.33 is the closest option.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. $97.33\n\nJust to make sure, let me think about the general formula for bond pricing.\n\nThe general formula for the price of a coupon-paying bond is:\n\nPrice = (C / r) * [1 - (1 + r)^(-n)] + F / (1 + r)^n\n\nWhere:\n\n- C is the annual coupon payment\n\n- r is the yield rate\n\n- n is the number of years\n\n- F is the face value\n\nIn this case:\n\nC = $5\n\nr = 0.06\n\nn = 3\n\nF = $100\n\nPlugging in:\n\nPrice = ($5 / 0.06) * [1 - (1 + 0.06)^(-3)] + $100 / (1 + 0.06)^3\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + 0.06)^(-3) = 1 / 1.191016 \u2248 0.8396\n\nThen, 1 - 0.8396 \u2248 0.1604\n\nSo, ($5 / 0.06) * 0.1604 + $100 / 1.191016\n\n$5 / 0.06 = $83.3333\n\n$83.3333 * 0.1604 \u2248 $13.37\n\n$100 / 1.191016 \u2248 $83.96\n\nTotal price \u2248 $13.37 + $83.96 = $97.33\n\nAh, using this formula gives $97.33 directly.\n\nSo, my initial calculation was slightly off due to rounding in intermediate steps, but the exact answer is indeed $97.33.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. $97.33\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 97.33} \\]"
