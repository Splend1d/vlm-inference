                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about agency and incompetence. Let me try to wrap my head around it.\n\nLong is a purchasing agent for Frost, who's a sole proprietor. Long has express authority to place purchase orders with Frost's suppliers. That means Long can make binding purchases on behalf of Frost. Now, Frost has been declared incompetent in a judicial proceeding. After that happens, Long places an order with Grant Corp. on Frost's behalf. Both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence.\n\nThe question is, will Frost or Frost's legal representative be liable to Grant?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence.\n\nB. Yes, because the order was valid regardless of Frost's incompetence.\n\nC. No, because Grant dealt only with Long.\n\nD. No, because Long did not have authority to enter into the contract.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what happens to an agency relationship when the principal becomes incompetent.\n\nI recall that in general, an agency relationship is terminated when the principal dies or becomes incompetent. That's because the principal is no longer capable of entering into contracts or managing their affairs.\n\nSo, when Frost was declared incompetent, Long's authority as an agent likely terminated.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Long had express authority to place purchase orders. Does that mean that Long had actual authority to do so?\n\nYes, express authority means that Frost gave Long the power to place orders, probably in writing or verbally.\n\nHowever, when Frost was declared incompetent, that authority might have been terminated.\n\nBut the problem mentions that both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence.\n\nSo, does that mean that Long still had apparent authority to act on behalf of Frost?\n\nApparent authority is when a third party reasonably believes that an agent has the authority to act, based on the principal's actions or representations.\n\nIn this case, Grant reasonably believed that Long had the authority to place orders for Frost, since Long had always done so in the past and there was no reason to suspect that Frost was incompetent.\n\nSo, even if Long's actual authority was terminated upon Frost's incompetence, Grant could still hold Frost liable based on apparent authority.\n\nWait, but Frost has been declared incompetent. Does that affect the enforceability of contracts entered into on his behalf after the incompetence?\n\nI think that when someone is declared incompetent, a legal representative is usually appointed to manage their affairs. In this case, Frost's legal representative would be responsible for managing Frost's business.\n\nSo, if Long placed an order after Frost was declared incompetent, and both Long and Grant were unaware of the incompetence, does that mean that Frost's legal representative would still be liable for the contract?\n\nLet me see.\n\nI found this principle that says that when a principal becomes incompetent, the agent's authority is terminated, but if the agent enters into a contract without knowledge of the incompetence, and the third party is unaware of the incompetence, the contract may still be enforceable against the principal's estate or legal representative.\n\nSo, in this scenario, since both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence, the contract might still be valid, and Frost's legal representative might be liable.\n\nBut let's look at the options again.\n\nOption A says, \"Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence.\"\n\nIs that accurate?\n\nWell, generally, an agency terminates upon the principal's incompetence. So, strictly speaking, Long's agency did not survive Frost's incompetence. So, this option might not be correct.\n\nOption B says, \"Yes, because the order was valid regardless of Frost's incompetence.\"\n\nBut that seems too broad. In reality, Frost's incompetence could affect the validity of contracts entered into on his behalf, especially if the agent and third party were unaware of the incompetence.\n\nSo, I'm not sure about this one.\n\nOption C says, \"No, because Grant dealt only with Long.\"\n\nBut in reality, Long was acting as an agent for Frost. So, even if Grant dealt with Long, the contract was intended to be between Frost and Grant, not Long and Grant.\n\nTherefore, Frost or his legal representative would be the one potentially liable, not Long.\n\nSo, this option seems incorrect.\n\nOption D says, \"No, because Long did not have authority to enter into the contract.\"\n\nBut, as I thought earlier, even if Long's actual authority was terminated upon Frost's incompetence, Long might still have apparent authority if Grant reasonably believed that Long had the authority to act.\n\nIn this case, Grant had no reason to suspect that Frost was incompetent, so they likely relied on Long's past behavior and assumed that he still had the authority to place orders.\n\nTherefore, Frost's legal representative might still be liable based on apparent authority.\n\nSo, option D seems incorrect as well.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is \"Yes,\" but for a different reason.\n\nLet me consider the doctrine of ratification.\n\nIf Frost's legal representative ratifies the contract entered into by Long after Frost's incompetence, then Frost's legal representative could be liable.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify whether the legal representative ratified the contract.\n\nSo, that might not be applicable here.\n\nAnother thought: in some jurisdictions, contracts entered into on behalf of an incompetent principal might be voidable, but if the third party was unaware of the incompetence, the contract might still be enforceable.\n\nGiven that both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence, Grant might have a valid claim against Frost's estate or legal representative.\n\nTherefore, Frost's legal representative would be liable to Grant.\n\nSo, the answer is \"Yes,\" but not necessarily for the reasons given in options A or B.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Long's agency did not survive Frost's incompetence.\n\nOption B is too absolute; the validity of the order could be affected by Frost's incompetence, but in this case, since neither party was aware, the contract might still be enforceable.\n\nOption C is incorrect because Grant was dealing with Long as Frost's agent, not as an individual.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Long did have apparent authority to act, even if his actual authority was terminated.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is \"Yes,\" but none of the reasons provided seem entirely accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is \"Yes, because the order was valid regardless of Frost's incompetence.\"\n\nBut I think that's not entirely accurate, because Frost's incompetence could affect the validity of the contract.\n\nHowever, since neither party was aware of it, Grant might still hold Frost's legal representative liable based on apparent authority.\n\nSo, maybe option B is the closest, even if it's not perfectly phrased.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is \"Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence.\"\n\nBut as I thought earlier, that's not accurate because agency generally terminates upon the principal's incompetence.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is \"Yes,\" but for a different reason: apparent authority.\n\nSo, perhaps option A is intended to be correct, but it's based on a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"No, because Long did not have authority to enter into the contract.\"\n\nBut that seems incorrect because of apparent authority.\n\nI'm a bit confused now.\n\nLet me look up some case law or legal principles regarding agency and incompetence.\n\nAfter some research, I find that when a principal becomes incompetent, the agency relationship is terminated. However, if the agent enters into a contract without knowledge of the incompetence, and the third party is unaware of the incompetence, the contract may still be enforceable against the principal's estate or legal representative based on apparent authority.\n\nSo, in this case, since both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence, Grant could reasonably believe that Long had the authority to place orders on behalf of Frost.\n\nTherefore, Frost's legal representative would be liable to Grant for the contract.\n\nSo, the answer is \"Yes,\" but neither option A nor B accurately reflects the reason.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Long's agency did not survive Frost's incompetence.\n\nOption B is too broad and not entirely accurate.\n\nOption C is incorrect because Grant was dealing with Long as Frost's agent.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Long had apparent authority.\n\nTherefore, the closest correct answer is \"Yes,\" but based on apparent authority, which isn't listed.\n\nGiven that, I would choose option B, \"Yes, because the order was valid regardless of Frost's incompetence,\" but with the understanding that it's actually valid due to apparent authority.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is intended to be option A, but that's incorrect for the reasons I've stated.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that in some legal frameworks, the agency could survive incompetence under certain conditions, but I don't think that's generally the case.\n\nGiven standard agency law, I believe the correct answer is \"Yes,\" based on apparent authority, even though that's not explicitly stated in the options.\n\nTherefore, I'll select option B, understanding that it's not perfectly phrased but is the closest to the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
