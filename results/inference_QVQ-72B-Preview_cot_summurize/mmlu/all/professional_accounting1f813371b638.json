                    "text": "So I have this question here about a practitioner who needs to express an opinion on management's assertion about the square footage of a warehouse. The assertion is that the warehouse is 150,000 square feet, and I need to figure out which professional guidance the practitioner should refer to for this type of engagement.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Statements on Auditing Standards\n\nB. Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements\n\nC. Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services\n\nD. Statements on Standards for Consulting Services\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked here. The practitioner is being asked to express an opinion on a specific assertion made by management regarding the warehouse's square footage. This sounds like an attestation engagement, where a practitioner provides an opinion or conclusion on the subject matter of an assertion made by another party.\n\nLet me recall what each of these statements generally covers:\n\nA. Statements on Auditing Standards (SAS): These are guidelines for conducting financial statement audits. They provide standards for auditors to follow when examining and reporting on financial statements.\n\nB. Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE): These statements provide guidance for practitioners performing attestation engagements, which involve issuing a report on the reliability of a subject matter or an assertion made by another party.\n\nC. Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARS): These statements provide guidance for accountants performing compilations and reviews of financial statements, which are less extensive than audits.\n\nD. Statements on Standards for Consulting Services (SSCS): These statements provide guidance for consulting services that do not involve the performance of an audit, review, or compilation engagement.\n\nGiven this background, it seems that the most appropriate guidance for expressing an opinion on management's assertion about the warehouse's square footage would be found in the Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE). This is because the engagement involves providing an opinion on an assertion made by management, which is a characteristic of attestation engagements.\n\nLet me think about this further. If the practitioner were performing an audit of the financial statements, which would be covered under SAS, they might incidentally verify the square footage as part of their audit procedures. However, the primary focus of an audit is the financial statements as a whole, not a specific assertion like the square footage.\n\nOn the other hand, SSARS covers accounting and review services, which are typically related to financial statements but are less comprehensive than audits. Consulting services under SSCS are more varied and don't involve the same level of assurance as attestation engagements.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting choice seems to be SSAE, as it directly addresses engagements where the practitioner is asked to provide an opinion on a specific assertion made by management.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider whether this engagement is an examination or a review under SSAE. An examination provides reasonable assurance, while a review provides limited assurance. But the question is asking for an opinion on the assertion, which suggests a higher level of assurance, possibly an examination.\n\nHowever, the exact level of assurance might depend on the engagement terms and the needs of the user. But regardless of whether it's an examination or a review, the general guidance would still come from SSAE.\n\nAnother thought: since the assertion is about the square footage of a warehouse, which is a specific measurement, perhaps there are industry-specific standards or guidelines that the practitioner should also consider. But the question is specifically about professional guidance for the engagement type, not industry-specific standards.\n\nI should also consider if there's any relevance of Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARS) here. SSARS primarily deals with compilations and reviews of financial statements, which aren't directly related to providing an opinion on a specific assertion like square footage.\n\nSimilarly, Statements on Standards for Consulting Services (SSCS) cover a broad range of non-assurance services, but again, this doesn't seem to fit the scenario of expressing an opinion on a specific assertion.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I believe that the correct answer is B. Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE). This is because attestation engagements involve providing assurance on assertions made by another party, which aligns perfectly with the scenario described.\n\nTo make sure I'm not missing something, let me double-check. If a practitioner is to express an opinion on management's assertion about the warehouse's square footage, it's essentially an attestation engagement where the subject matter is the square footage, and the assertion is that it is 150,000 square feet. SSAE would provide the necessary guidance on how to perform such an engagement and report on the findings.\n\nIn contrast, SAS would be more relevant if the engagement involved auditing the financial statements where the warehouse's square footage might be a component, but it's not the primary focus. SSARS would apply to reviews and compilations of financial statements, again not directly related to this specific assertion. SSCS covers consulting services, which don't involve assurance engagements.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct choice is B. Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
