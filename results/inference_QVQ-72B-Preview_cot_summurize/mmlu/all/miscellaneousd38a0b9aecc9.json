                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"What is the name of the Newtonian law that states 'An object in motion tends to stay in motion'?\" And the options are A. Law of Inertia, B. Law of Thermodynamics, C. Law of Relativity, and D. Law of Gravitation.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what each of these laws is about. Let's start with Newton's laws of motion because I think the answer is related to one of them.\n\nNewton's first law, which I believe is also called the law of inertia, states that an object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an external force. So, it's about objects resisting changes to their state of motion.\n\nNewton's second law is about how applied forces cause acceleration, and it's usually expressed as F equals ma, where F is force, m is mass, and a is acceleration.\n\nNewton's third law is about action and reaction, stating that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nNow, the question specifically mentions \"an object in motion tends to stay in motion.\" That sounds a lot like the first law, which talks about objects resisting changes to their motion unless a force acts on them.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nThe law of thermodynamics is actually a bit different. There are four laws of thermodynamics, but they deal with energy, heat, and entropy, not with the motion of objects directly.\n\nThe law of relativity, whether special or general, is more about how physical laws work in different frames of reference and the relationship between space and time. So, that doesn't seem directly related to the statement in the question.\n\nThe law of gravitation is about the force of attraction between two masses, which is important for explaining things like planetary motion, but again, that's not directly about objects staying in motion.\n\nGiven that, it seems like the correct answer should be A. Law of Inertia.\n\nWait a minute, the option is phrased as \"Law of Inertia,\" but in the Newtonian laws, it's often referred to as Newton's first law. Is there a difference between the two?\n\nActually, inertia is a property of matter that resists any change in its state of motion, and Newton's first law describes this property. So, they are essentially the same thing.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any confusion between different formulations of the laws.\n\nNewton's first law is indeed the law of inertia, which describes the tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion. It states that an object in motion will remain in motion at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force.\n\nGiven that, the statement \"An object in motion tends to stay in motion\" is a simplification of Newton's first law, which is also known as the law of inertia.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Law of Inertia.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. The other options don't relate to the statement provided in the question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Law of Inertia}} \\]"
