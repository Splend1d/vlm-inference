                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about a psychologist who thinks that rewarding good behavior is better than punishing bad behavior for promoting good behavior in children. There's a scale for \"proper behavior,\" and they have two groups: one getting positive rewards and the other getting punishment. So, \u03bc1 is the average rating for the rewards group, and \u03bc2 is for the punishment group.\n\nThe null hypothesis is H0: \u03bc1 - \u03bc2 = 0, which means there's no difference between the two groups. Now, I need to figure out what the alternative hypothesis HA should be based on the psychologist's belief.\n\nThe psychologist believes that positive rewards are more effective than punishment for promoting good behavior. So, I think that means that the rewards group should have a higher \"proper behavior\" rating than the punishment group. In other words, \u03bc1 should be greater than \u03bc2.\n\nIf \u03bc1 is greater than \u03bc2, then \u03bc1 - \u03bc2 would be greater than zero. So, the alternative hypothesis should be HA: \u03bc1 - \u03bc2 > 0.\n\nLet me double-check. The null says there's no difference, and the alternative should say that rewards lead to higher behavior ratings. So, yes, HA: \u03bc1 - \u03bc2 > 0 makes sense.\n\nWait, but the problem says that if H0: \u03bc1 - \u03bc2 = 0, which of the following is the proper statement of HA? The options are:\n\nA. HA: \u03bc1 - \u03bc2 > 0\n\nB. HA: \u03bc1 - \u03bc2 < 0\n\nC. HA: \u03bc1 - \u03bc2 \u2260 0\n\nD. Any of the above is an acceptable alternative to the given null.\n\nGiven that the psychologist believes rewards are better than punishment, I think the alternative hypothesis should specifically state that \u03bc1 is greater than \u03bc2, not just that they are different. So, HA: \u03bc1 - \u03bc2 > 0 seems the most appropriate.\n\nOption C, HA: \u03bc1 - \u03bc2 \u2260 0, would just say that there is a difference, but it doesn't specify the direction, which is important here because the psychologist has a specific direction in mind.\n\nOption B, HA: \u03bc1 - \u03bc2 < 0, would suggest that punishment is better than rewards, which contradicts the psychologist's belief.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be A. HA: \u03bc1 - \u03bc2 > 0.\n\nBut wait, option D says any of the above is acceptable, but that might not be the case here because the psychologist has a specific belief about the direction of the difference.\n\nI think the answer is A, but let me see if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the psychologist just believes that rewards are more effective, meaning that \u03bc1 should be higher than \u03bc2, so again, HA: \u03bc1 - \u03bc2 > 0.\n\nYes, I'm confident that A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
