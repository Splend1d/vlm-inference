                    "text": "So I have this problem here that asks which of the given conditions can be expressed by a Boolean formula using the variables p\u2081, p\u2082, p\u2083, p\u2084 and the connectives \u2227 (and) and \u2228 (or), but without using \u00ac (not). The conditions are:\n\nI. At least three of p\u2081, p\u2082, p\u2083, p\u2084 are true.\n\nII. Exactly three of p\u2081, p\u2082, p\u2083, p\u2084 are true.\n\nIII. An even number of p\u2081, p\u2082, p\u2083, p\u2084 are true.\n\nAnd the options are A. I only, B. II only, C. III only, D. I and III.\n\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to express these conditions using only \u2227 and \u2228, without \u00ac. So, I can't use negation directly, which might make some of these conditions tricky to express.\n\nLet's consider condition I: At least three of p\u2081, p\u2082, p\u2083, p\u2084 are true.\n\nThis means that either three or all four variables are true. So, I need a formula that is true when exactly three or four variables are true.\n\nOne way to think about this is to find a formula that is true when at least three variables are true. Using only \u2227 and \u2228, I can try to express this without negation.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that in Boolean algebra, the expression for \"at least k out of n\" can sometimes be expressed using sums of conjunctions. Maybe I can find a way to sum the number of true variables using only \u2227 and \u2228.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that (p\u2081 \u2228 p\u2082 \u2228 p\u2083 \u2228 p\u2084) gives me the count of true variables, but that's not directly helpful because it's just a sum, not a way to check if it's at least three.\n\nWait, maybe I can think in terms of pairwise conjunctions or something like that.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Maybe I can use the fact that (p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2082) \u2228 (p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2083) \u2228 (p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2084) \u2228 (p\u2082 \u2227 p\u2083) \u2228 (p\u2082 \u2227 p\u2084) \u2228 (p\u2083 \u2227 p\u2084) counts the number of pairs where both variables are true. But I'm not sure how that helps me count the total number of true variables.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that \"at least three\" is equivalent to \"not fewer than three.\" But since I can't use \u00ac, that might not help directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that if at least three are true, then it's equivalent to (p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2082 \u2227 p\u2083) \u2228 (p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2082 \u2227 p\u2084) \u2228 (p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2083 \u2227 p\u2084) \u2228 (p\u2082 \u2227 p\u2083 \u2227 p\u2084) \u2228 (p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2082 \u2227 p\u2083 \u2227 p\u2084). That is, the disjunction of all possible conjunctions of three or four variables.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, condition I can be expressed as:\n\n(p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2082 \u2227 p\u2083) \u2228 (p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2082 \u2227 p\u2084) \u2228 (p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2083 \u2227 p\u2084) \u2228 (p\u2082 \u2227 p\u2083 \u2227 p\u2084) \u2228 (p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2082 \u2227 p\u2083 \u2227 p\u2084)\n\nSo, condition I is expressible using only \u2227 and \u2228.\n\nNow, let's look at condition II: Exactly three of p\u2081, p\u2082, p\u2083, p\u2084 are true.\n\nThis means that three variables are true, and one is false. But since I can't use \u00ac, I need to find a way to express that exactly three are true without referring to the negation of any variable.\n\nWait, but if exactly three are true, then the fourth must be false. So, for example, if p\u2081, p\u2082, and p\u2083 are true, then p\u2084 must be false. But again, I can't use \u00ac directly.\n\nMaybe I can think of it as (p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2082 \u2227 p\u2083 \u2227 \u00acp\u2084), but that uses \u00ac, which is not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express it as (p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2082 \u2227 p\u2083 \u2227 (p\u2084 \u2228 p\u2084)) but that doesn't help.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the fact that exactly three are true if and only if at least three are true and not all four are true.\n\nSo, from condition I, I have the formula for at least three being true: (p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2082 \u2227 p\u2083) \u2228 (p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2082 \u2227 p\u2084) \u2228 (p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2083 \u2227 p\u2084) \u2228 (p\u2082 \u2227 p\u2083 \u2227 p\u2084) \u2228 (p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2082 \u2227 p\u2083 \u2227 p\u2084)\n\nNow, to have exactly three true, I need that formula and also that not all four are true.\n\nBut again, I can't use \u00ac directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the expression for at least three being true and subtract the case where all four are true.\n\nSo, exactly three true would be: (p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2082 \u2227 p\u2083 \u2227 \u00acp\u2084) \u2228 (p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2082 \u2227 p\u2084 \u2227 \u00acp\u2083) \u2228 (p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2083 \u2227 p\u2084 \u2227 \u00acp\u2082) \u2228 (p\u2082 \u2227 p\u2083 \u2227 p\u2084 \u2227 \u00acp\u2081)\n\nBut again, this uses \u00ac, which is not allowed.\n\nIs there a way to express this without using \u00ac?\n\nLet me think about it differently. Maybe I can use the fact that exactly three are true if and only if the conjunction of any three variables is true and the disjunction of all four variables is false. But again, that would involve \u00ac.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that exactly three are true if and only if the conjunction of any three variables is true and the conjunction of all four is false. But again, that involves \u00ac.\n\nWait, maybe I can think in terms of exclusive or, but exclusive or involves \u00ac, which is not allowed.\n\nThis is getting tricky. Maybe condition II cannot be expressed without using \u00ac.\n\nLet me move on to condition III: An even number of p\u2081, p\u2082, p\u2083, p\u2084 are true.\n\nThis means that either 0, 2, or 4 variables are true.\n\nAgain, I need to express this using only \u2227 and \u2228, without \u00ac.\n\nFirst, let's think about what an even number of true variables means.\n\nIt could be that none are true, exactly two are true, or all four are true.\n\nSo, the formula would be: (\u00acp\u2081 \u2227 \u00acp\u2082 \u2227 \u00acp\u2083 \u2227 \u00acp\u2084) \u2228 (p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2082 \u2227 \u00acp\u2083 \u2227 \u00acp\u2084 \u2228 p\u2081 \u2227 \u00acp\u2082 \u2227 p\u2083 \u2227 \u00acp\u2084 \u2228 p\u2081 \u2227 \u00acp\u2082 \u2227 \u00acp\u2083 \u2227 p\u2084 \u2228 \u00acp\u2081 \u2227 p\u2082 \u2227 p\u2083 \u2227 \u00acp\u2084 \u2228 \u00acp\u2081 \u2227 p\u2082 \u2227 \u00acp\u2083 \u2227 p\u2084 \u2228 \u00acp\u2081 \u2227 \u00acp\u2082 \u2227 p\u2083 \u2227 p\u2084) \u2228 (p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2082 \u2227 p\u2083 \u2227 p\u2084)\n\nBut again, this uses \u00ac, which is not allowed.\n\nIs there a way to express this without using \u00ac?\n\nLet me think about the exclusive or (xor) operation, which is often used to check for an odd number of true variables. But xor involves \u00ac, which is not allowed here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that an even number of variables are true if and only if the xor of all variables is false.\n\nBut again, that involves \u00ac.\n\nWait, maybe I can find a way to express the xor using only \u2227 and \u2228.\n\nI recall that xor can be expressed as (p \u2228 q) \u2227 \u00ac(p \u2227 q), but that still uses \u00ac.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that xor is equivalent to (p \u2227 \u00acq) \u2228 (\u00acp \u2227 q), but again, that uses \u00ac.\n\nIs there any way to express xor without using \u00ac?\n\nLet me think about it.\n\nSuppose I have two variables, p and q.\n\nI want to express p xor q using only \u2227 and \u2228.\n\nI know that p xor q is true when one of them is true and the other is false.\n\nBut without \u00ac, I can't directly express \"one is true and the other is false.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of p xor q as (p \u2228 q) \u2227 \u00ac(p \u2227 q), but again, that uses \u00ac.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that p xor q is equivalent to (p \u2227 \u00acq) \u2228 (\u00acp \u2227 q), but that still uses \u00ac.\n\nIs there any other way to express xor without \u00ac?\n\nLet me try to see if I can find a formula using only \u2227 and \u2228 that behaves like xor.\n\nSuppose I try (p \u2228 q) \u2227 (p \u2228 \u00acq) \u2227 (\u00acp \u2228 q), but that still uses \u00ac.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that p xor q is equivalent to (p \u2227 \u00acq) \u2228 (\u00acp \u2227 q), but again, that uses \u00ac.\n\nIt seems that without \u00ac, I cannot express xor, and therefore, I cannot express whether the number of true variables is even or odd.\n\nSo, perhaps condition III cannot be expressed without using \u00ac.\n\nGiven that, it seems that only condition I can be expressed using only \u2227 and \u2228 without \u00ac.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. I only.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check.\n\nIs there any way to express condition III without using \u00ac?\n\nMaybe by using some clever combination of \u2227 and \u2228.\n\nLet's consider the formula: (p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2082 \u2227 p\u2083 \u2227 p\u2084) \u2228 (p\u2081 \u2227 p\u2082 \u2227 \u00acp\u2083 \u2227 \u00acp\u2084) \u2228 (p\u2081 \u2227 \u00acp\u2082 \u2227 p\u2083 \u2227 \u00acp\u2084) \u2228 (p\u2081 \u2227 \u00acp\u2082 \u2227 \u00acp\u2083 \u2227 p\u2084) \u2228 (\u00acp\u2081 \u2227 p\u2082 \u2227 p\u2083 \u2227 \u00acp\u2084) \u2228 (\u00acp\u2081 \u2227 p\u2082 \u2227 \u00acp\u2083 \u2227 p\u2084) \u2228 (\u00acp\u2081 \u2227 \u00acp\u2082 \u2227 p\u2083 \u2227 p\u2084)\n\nBut this uses \u00ac, which is not allowed.\n\nIs there a way to express the same thing without \u00ac?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it in terms of the symmetric difference or something, but that might not help here.\n\nGiven that, it seems that conditions II and III cannot be expressed without using \u00ac, whereas condition I can be expressed using only \u2227 and \u2228.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. I only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
