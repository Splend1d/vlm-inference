Let's see, the basic premise is that people remember unfinished or interrupted tasks better than completed ones. So, in the context of this question, option A seems to align with that. It says we tend to remember unfinished tasks better than finished ones.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options. Option B says we tend to remember finished tasks better than unfinished ones. That seems contrary to what I recall about the Zeigarnik effect. Option C mentions that we remember difficult tasks better than easy ones. While there might be some truth to that in general memory retention, I don't think that's directly related to the Zeigarnik effect. And similarly, option D suggests we remember easy tasks better than difficult ones, which again doesn't seem directly connected to the Zeigarnik effect.\n\nLet me think back to when I first learned about the Zeigarnik effect. I remember that it was discovered by a psychologist named Bluma Zeigarnik, who observed that waiters in restaurants could recall unpaid orders much more accurately than orders that had already been paid for. So, essentially, the unfinished or unfulfilled tasks lingered in their memory better than the completed ones.\n\nAnother way I've seen this effect demonstrated is through experiments where participants are given a series of tasks to start, but only some of them are completed. When asked to recall the tasks later, they tend to remember the incomplete tasks more readily.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems pretty clear that the Zeigarnik effect refers to the tendency to remember unfinished tasks better than finished ones. Therefore, the correct answer should be option A.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check each option once more:\n\n- A: We tend to remember unfinished tasks better than finished ones. This aligns with the Zeigarnik effect.\n\n- B: We tend to remember finished tasks better than unfinished ones. This contradicts the Zeigarnik effect.\n\n- C: We tend to remember difficult tasks better than easy ones. While difficulty can affect memory, this isn't the focus of the Zeigarnik effect.\n\n- D: We tend to remember easy tasks better than difficult ones. Again, while task difficulty can influence memory, this isn't directly related to the Zeigarnik effect.\n\nYes, I'm confident that option A is the correct choice here. The Zeigarnik effect is all about how unfinished tasks stick in our memory more persistently than those that are completed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
