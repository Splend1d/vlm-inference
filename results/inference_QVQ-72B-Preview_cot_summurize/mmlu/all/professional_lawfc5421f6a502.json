                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a defendant who was arrested for bank robbery. He had an initial appearance before a magistrate judge, where he was told about the charges and that a lawyer would be appointed for him the next day. But then, the police made him participate in a lineup with other prisoners, where they all had to wear white T-shirts and say, \"Put your hands in the air.\" Witnesses identified him as the robber during this lineup. The next day, he was arraigned on the charges. Now, he's claiming that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated because he didn't have a lawyer present at both the initial appearance and the lineup.\n\nI need to figure out if his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was indeed violated at either or both of these stages. The options are:\n\nA. No.\n\nB. Yes, based only on the denial of counsel at the initial appearance.\n\nC. Yes, based only on the denial of counsel at the lineup.\n\nD. Yes, based on the denial of counsel at both stages of the proceeding.\n\nFirst, I should recall what the Sixth Amendment right to counsel entails. The Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to assistance of counsel for persons accused of crimes. This right attaches at \"critical stages\" of the criminal process.\n\nSo, the key here is to identify which parts of the criminal process are considered \"critical stages\" where the right to counsel applies.\n\nI remember that the right to counsel generally attaches at the time of arraignment, during police lineups, and other formal judicial proceedings.\n\nIn this case, the initial appearance before the magistrate judge and the lineup are both events that happened before the arraignment.\n\nLet me think about the initial appearance first.\n\nThe initial appearance is when the defendant is brought before a judge or magistrate, informed of the charges against him, and usually, bail is set. In this scenario, the defendant was also told that counsel would be appointed for him the next day.\n\nIs the initial appearance a critical stage where the right to counsel attaches?\n\nFrom what I recall, in some jurisdictions, the initial appearance might not be considered a critical stage that requires the presence of counsel, especially if it's a preliminary hearing where the primary purpose is to inform the defendant of the charges and set bail.\n\nHowever, there have been changes in case law over the years. I think there was a case called Rothgery v. Gillespie County, where the Supreme Court held that the right to counsel attaches when a defendant is brought before a judicial officer and the prosecution initiates adversarial judicial proceedings.\n\nIn that case, the initial appearance was seen as the start of adversarial judicial proceedings, thereby triggering the right to counsel.\n\nBut, I also recall that in other cases, like Montoya de Hernandez v. Mesa, the Court distinguished between different types of proceedings and whether counsel is required.\n\nMaybe I should look up some landmark cases to get a better understanding.\n\nLet me consider Rothgery v. Gillespie County (2008). In this case, the Supreme Court held that a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches when a judicial officer determines that there is probable cause to believe the defendant has committed a crime, even if no formal charges have been filed yet.\n\nSo, if during the initial appearance, the magistrate judge determines that there's probable cause to believe the defendant committed the bank robbery, then the right to counsel would attach at that point.\n\nIn this scenario, the defendant was notified of the charges and told that counsel would be appointed the next day. It seems like the magistrate might have found probable cause, given that he was being held and counsel was being appointed.\n\nIf that's the case, then the defendant should have had counsel present at the initial appearance.\n\nBut, the police required him to participate in a lineup without counsel being present.\n\nNow, lineups are another critical stage where the right to counsel applies.\n\nI remember the case of United States v. Wade (1967), where the Supreme Court held that a defendant has the right to have counsel present during any lineup conducted after the adversary judicial proceedings have been initiated, whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\n\nIn this scenario, the initial appearance might be considered an adversary judicial proceeding, especially if probable cause was determined.\n\nIf that's the case, then the lineup conducted after the initial appearance should have had counsel present.\n\nBut in this situation, counsel was not appointed until the next day, after the lineup had already taken place.\n\nSo, if the initial appearance is considered a critical stage where the right to counsel attaches, and the lineup occurred after that, then both the initial appearance and the lineup should have had counsel present.\n\nGiven that counsel was not present at either, option D seems to be the correct answer: yes, based on the denial of counsel at both stages of the proceeding.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the initial appearance is indeed a critical stage where the right to counsel attaches, and the defendant was denied counsel there, that's one violation.\n\nThen, the lineup, being a critical stage that occurs after the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings, also required counsel to be present, which didn't happen.\n\nTherefore, both stages violated the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\n\nOption D seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the initial appearance is not considered a critical stage.\n\nIf the initial appearance is not a critical stage, then perhaps only the lineup would be a violation.\n\nBut based on Rothgery v. Gillespie County, it seems that the initial appearance can be a critical stage if probable cause is determined.\n\nIn this scenario, since the defendant was being held and counsel was being appointed, it's likely that probable cause was found.\n\nTherefore, both the initial appearance and the lineup are critical stages where counsel should have been present.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Yes, based on the denial of counsel at both stages of the proceeding.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
