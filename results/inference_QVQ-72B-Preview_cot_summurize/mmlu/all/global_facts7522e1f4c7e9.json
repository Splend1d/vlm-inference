                    "text": "So I need to figure out what percentage of GDP the United States spends on its military as of 2017. The options are 1%, 3%, 6%, or 10%. Hmm, I'm not sure off the top of my head, but I think I can reason this out.\n\nFirst, I remember that GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced by a country in a year. And military spending is the amount of money a government allocates for its armed forces. So, the question is asking for the proportion of the total economic output that goes to the military.\n\nI recall that the United States has a large military budget, but I don't remember the exact percentage of GDP it represents. Let me see if I can recall any recent figures or news articles about this.\n\nI think that in 2017, the U.S. military budget was around $700 billion. But I need to find out what percentage that is of the total GDP.\n\nLet me try to recall the U.S. GDP in 2017. I think it was somewhere around $19 trillion. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nSo, if the military budget was $700 billion and the GDP was $19 trillion, then the calculation would be:\n\n($700 billion) / ($19 trillion) = ?\n\nFirst, I need to make sure both numbers are in the same unit. $700 billion is the same as $0.7 trillion, right?\n\nWait, no. Actually, $700 billion is $0.7 trillion, but I think the budget might have been higher than that. Maybe it was $700 billion or $750 billion, but for simplicity, let's stick with $700 billion.\n\nSo, $700 billion divided by $19 trillion equals $700/$19,000. That would be 700 divided by 19,000.\n\nLet me simplify that fraction: 700/19,000 = 7/190, because both numerator and denominator can be divided by 100.\n\nNow, 7 divided by 190. Let's see, 190 times 0.035 is approximately 6.65, but that doesn't seem right because 7 is larger than that.\n\nWait, maybe I should just plug this into a calculator, but since I'm doing this mentally, I need to find a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about 7/190 as roughly 3.5% divided by 10, which is 0.35%. But that seems too low.\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. 7 divided by 190 is actually approximately 0.0368, which is 3.68%, but that's not precise enough.\n\nMaybe I should try a different approach. Perhaps recall that the U.S. military spending as a percentage of GDP has been decreasing over the years, but I'm not sure about the exact figure in 2017.\n\nLet me consider that the U.S. typically spends between 3% and 6% of its GDP on the military. Given that, the options are 1%, 3%, 6%, and 10%.\n\nGiven my earlier calculation, which was roughly 3.68%, it seems that 3% is the closest option provided.\n\nBut I need to confirm if that's accurate. Maybe I should check some references or recall if there have been any significant changes in military spending around 2017.\n\nI remember that in 2017, there were discussions about increasing the military budget, but I don't recall if those increases were substantial enough to push the percentage up to 6% or 10% of GDP.\n\nGiven that, and my earlier calculation pointing towards around 3.68%, I think 3% is the closest option.\n\nBut let me double-check. If the military budget was $700 billion and GDP was $19 trillion, then 700/19,000 is indeed approximately 3.68%, which rounds to 4%, but among the options, 3% is closer than 6% or 10%.\n\nWait, but 3.68% is closer to 4%, but 4% isn't an option. So, between 3% and 6%, 3% is closer to 3.68%.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B. 3%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
