I need to recall which one doesn't count as a penalty in the sport.\n\nFirst, I know that in ice hockey, penalties are enforced for various infractions against the rules. These can include physical actions against other players or actions against the puck that aren't allowed.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Hooking: I remember that hooking is when a player uses their stick to hook an opponent's body or stick. That sounds like it would be against the rules, so I bet it's a penalty.\n\nB. Charging: Charging is when a player runs into another player with excessive force, usually from behind or from the side. That also seems like it would be penalized for player safety.\n\nC. Carving: Hmm, carving in ice hockey... I'm not as familiar with this term. Is carving a penalty in ice hockey? Maybe it's related to edging or turning sharply on the ice, but I'm not sure if it's a penalizable action.\n\nD. Butt-ending: This sounds aggressive. Butt-ending is likely when a player uses the heel of their stick to strike an opponent. That seems dangerous and probably is a penalty.\n\nFrom my knowledge, hooking, charging, and butt-ending are all penalties in ice hockey. That leaves carving as the option that might not be a penalty.\n\nLet me double-check. I found that carving in ice hockey refers to a maneuver where a player uses their skates to make a sharp turn or change direction quickly by digging their skates into the ice. This is a legitimate playing technique, not a penalty.\n\nSo, if carving is a legitimate move and not a penalizable action, then the answer should be C. carving.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll confirm if any of the other options could possibly not be penalties.\n\nHooking is definitely a penalty; it's intended to prevent players from using their sticks improperly to gain an advantage or cause harm.\n\nCharging is also a penalty; it's about player safety, preventing high-impact collisions that could injure someone.\n\nButt-ending is another clear penalty; striking an opponent with the stick's heel is dangerous and against the rules.\n\nTherefore, the only option that isn't a penalty is carving, which is a legitimate skating technique.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\text{ carving}} \\]"
