                    "text": "So I have this question here about Anscombe's view on moral philosophy. It says that Anscombe claims it's not profitable to do moral philosophy until we have an adequate philosophy of... and then there are four options: religion, physics, psychology, or art. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall who Anscombe is and what her main ideas were. I think G.E.M. Anscombe was an important philosopher, especially known for her work in ethics and the philosophy of action. She was part of the mid-20th-century movement that emphasized ordinary language and common sense in philosophical analysis.\n\nNow, the question is about her stance on moral philosophy and its relationship to another field. She seems to be saying that moral philosophy isn't profitable or worthwhile unless there's an adequate philosophy of one of these areas first. So, I need to think about which of these fields is foundational for moral philosophy according to Anscombe.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Religion: Anscombe was a Christian and her faith influenced her philosophy, but I don't recall her stating that moral philosophy depends on a philosophy of religion. In fact, many moral philosophies are secular and don't rely on religious foundations.\n\nB. Physics: This seems unlikely. Moral philosophy deals with norms, values, and human conduct, whereas physics is about the natural world and physical laws. It's hard to see a direct dependency there.\n\nC. Psychology: This is a possible candidate. Moral philosophy often deals with human nature, intentions, and mental states, which are also the subject of psychology. Anscombe did contribute to the philosophy of mind and action, so perhaps she thought that understanding psychology is crucial for moral philosophy.\n\nD. Art: While aesthetics, which is the philosophy of art, can intersect with ethics in some ways, like in discussions of moral realism or the relationship between beauty and goodness, I don't think Anscombe specifically tied moral philosophy to the philosophy of art in this way.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C, psychology, seems the most plausible. But I should double-check this.\n\nI remember that Anscombe was critical of certain moral frameworks that didn't adequately account for human agency and intentionality. She argued for a return to Aristotelian and Thomistic virtues ethics, which emphasize the importance of character and virtuous habits. In this context, understanding the human psyche and the mechanisms of decision-making would be crucial for developing a robust moral philosophy.\n\nMoreover, in her famous paper \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" Anscombe critiques the prevalent moral frameworks of her time, suggesting that without a proper understanding of human nature and action, moral philosophy risks becoming mere rule-following without a deeper grasp of moral agency.\n\nSo, based on this, it makes sense that she would consider an adequate philosophy of psychology as a prerequisite for profitable moral philosophy. Psychology helps us understand the inner workings of people, their motivations, and capacities for moral reasoning and action, which are essential for constructing a meaningful moral philosophy.\n\nTo sum it up, I think the correct answer is C. psychology.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. psychology}} \\]"
