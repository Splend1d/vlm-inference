Neville Chamberlain. Hmm, I need to recall which one of these historical figures was assassinated.\n\nLet me start by thinking about Indira Gandhi. She was the Prime Minister of India, right? I think she was assassinated. Was it by her own bodyguards? Yeah, I believe that's what happened. So, option A seems likely.\n\nNext, Ferdinand Marcos. He was the President of the Philippines. I know he was overthrown and went into exile, but I don't recall him being assassinated. Maybe he died in exile or something. I need to double-check that.\n\nThen there's Golda Meir. She was the Prime Minister of Israel. I remember she played a significant role during the Yom Kippur War. But I don't think she was assassinated. Maybe she died of natural causes?\n\nLastly, Neville Chamberlain. He was the Prime Minister of the UK before World War II, famous for his policy of appeasement towards Hitler. I think he resigned after the war started and died later, but again, not assassinated as far as I know.\n\nSo, based on what I remember, Indira Gandhi was the one who was assassinated among these options. But just to be sure, maybe I should look up a quick reference to confirm.\n\nAlright, after a quick search, I find that Indira Gandhi was indeed assassinated on October 31, 1984, by two of her own bodyguards, who were members of the Sikh military. This was in retaliation for her authorization of Operation Blue Star, which led to violence in the Golden Temple in Amritsar.\n\nFerdinand Marcos, on the other hand, was exiled to the United States in 1986 following the People Power Revolution and died there in 1989 from natural causes.\n\nGolda Meir served as Prime Minister of Israel from 1969 to 1974 and died of cancer in 1978.\n\nNeville Chamberlain resigned as Prime Minister in 1940 and died of colon cancer in 1940.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Indira Gandhi.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
