                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It's a measure that examines changes in the cost of living by looking at the price changes of a basket of goods and services over time. The base period is like a starting point, and all price changes are compared to that period.\n\nSo, in the base period, the cost of this basket is $200, and in the current period, it's $400. I need to figure out what the CPI is in the current period based on this information.\n\nFirst, I should recall the formula for calculating the CPI. I think it's:\n\nCPI = (Price of the basket in the current period / Price of the basket in the base period) \u00d7 100\n\nYes, that sounds right. So, plugging in the numbers:\n\nCPI = ($400 / $200) \u00d7 100\n\nThat's (2) \u00d7 100, which equals 200.\n\nSo, the CPI equals 200 in the current period.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that formula. I found that CPI is defined as (Price in current period / Price in base period) \u00d7 100. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. equals 0.5 in the current period.\n\nNo, that's not right. If CPI is 200, it's certainly not 0.5.\n\nB. has risen 5 percent from the base to the current period.\n\nHmm, the CPI is 200, which means prices have doubled from the base period. If the base period is 100, and now it's 200, that's a 100% increase, not 5%. So, this option is incorrect.\n\nC. equals 50 in the current period.\n\nNo, that's way off. CPI should be 200, not 50.\n\nD. equals 200 in the current period.\n\nYes, that matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that there isn't any trick here. Maybe I should consider the percentage change or something else.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If the cost of the basket has doubled from $200 to $400, that's a 100% increase.\n\nBut in terms of CPI, if the base period is set to 100, then a 100% increase would make the CPI 200, which matches option D.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might think in terms of inflation rate, but the question specifically asks for the CPI in the current period.\n\nI don't think there's more to it. It seems straightforward.\n\nSo, my final answer is D. equals 200 in the current period.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
