                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of the following is about the Watergate scandal? A. All the King's Men' B. All the Pretty Horses' C. All the President's Men' D. All the Right Moves'.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these titles refers to the Watergate scandal.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Watergate scandal was a major political scandal in the United States involving the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C., and the Nixon administration's attempted cover-up of its involvement. It led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon in 1974.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. All the King's Men: I think this is a novel by Robert Penn Warren about a populist governor's rise and fall, which was later made into a movie. It's more about political corruption in general, not specifically about Watergate.\n\nB. All the Pretty Horses: This sounds like a book by Cormac McCarthy, part of a trilogy set in the American Southwest. It's about a young man's adventures and doesn't seem related to Watergate.\n\nC. All the President's Men: This rings a bell. I think it's a book about journalists investigating the Watergate scandal. The title suggests it's connected to the presidency and possibly to Nixon's administration. Maybe it's about the reporters who uncovered the scandal.\n\nD. All the Right Moves: This sounds like a movie about high school football and coming of age in a small town. Not political or related to Watergate.\n\nSo, based on what I recall, option C, All the President's Men, seems to be the one about the Watergate scandal. It's probably the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that. Let me see if I can recall any details about these works.\n\nAll the King's Men: That's about Willie Stark, a character based loosely on Huey Long, a political figure from Louisiana. It's a fictionally altered account of Long's career and assassination. Definitely not Watergate.\n\nAll the Pretty Horses: That's the first book in the Border Trilogy by Cormac McCarthy. It's set in Texas and Mexico in the late 1940s and early 1950s, focusing on a young man named John Grady Cole. No connection to Watergate there.\n\nAll the President's Men: This one I remember more clearly. It's a non-fiction book by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, two reporters for The Washington Post who investigated the Watergate scandal. The book details their investigation and how they uncovered the extent of the Nixon administration's involvement in the cover-up. So, yes, this is directly about the Watergate scandal.\n\nAll the Right Moves: That's a film from the 1980s starring Michael Keaton, about a high school football player in a small Pennsylvania town hoping to get a college scholarship. Again, no relation to Watergate.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. All the President's Men. It's important to remember that this book played a significant role in exposing the Watergate scandal and ultimately contributed to the resignation of President Nixon.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility that another option could be related to Watergate. For instance, perhaps All the King's Men could be interpreted in a way that relates to political scandals in general, but it's not specifically about Watergate. All the Pretty Horses is clearly unrelated, as it's set decades before the scandal and in a different region. All the Right Moves is also unrelated, as it's a drama about teenage life and sports.\n\nSo, after considering all the options carefully, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. All the President's Men.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
