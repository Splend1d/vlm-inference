                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about finding the mass of Mars' atmosphere. It gives me a few pieces of information: the atmospheric pressure is 600 pascals, the acceleration due to gravity is about 4 m/s\u00b2, and the surface area of Mars is around 145,000,000 square kilometers. I need to find the approximate mass of the Martian atmosphere, and there are a few options to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how pressure, gravity, and mass are related. I think there's a formula that connects pressure, gravity, and density, but I'm not sure. Wait, pressure is force per unit area, and force is mass times acceleration. So, pressure is mass times gravity divided by area. Does that make sense?\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nPressure = (Mass \u00d7 Gravity) / Surface Area\n\nOkay, so if I rearrange that, I can solve for mass:\n\nMass = Pressure \u00d7 Surface Area / Gravity\n\nThat seems straightforward. Let's plug in the numbers.\n\nPressure is 600 pascals.\n\nSurface area is 145,000,000 square kilometers. Wait, pascals are in N/m\u00b2, and square kilometers are different units. I need to make sure the units are consistent.\n\n1 square kilometer is 1,000,000 square meters, right? So, 145,000,000 km\u00b2 is 145,000,000 \u00d7 1,000,000 = 1.45 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 m\u00b2.\n\nGravity is 4 m/s\u00b2.\n\nSo, Mass = 600 \u00d7 1.45 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 / 4\n\nLet's do the math step by step.\n\nFirst, 600 divided by 4 is 150.\n\nThen, 150 \u00d7 1.45 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074.\n\n150 \u00d7 1.45 is 217.5.\n\nSo, 217.5 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 kg.\n\nThat's 2.175 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2077 kg.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 2.2x1011 kg\n\nB. 2.2x1014kg\n\nC. 2.2x1020kg\n\nD. 2.2x1016 kg\n\nNone of these match exactly, but maybe I did something wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the units again. Pressure is indeed force per unit area, and force is mass times gravity. So, Pressure = Force / Area = (Mass \u00d7 Gravity) / Area.\n\nRearranged, Mass = Pressure \u00d7 Area / Gravity.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nBut my result is 2.175 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2077 kg, which is closer to option D, 2.2 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2076 kg, but not exactly the same. Maybe I made a calculation error.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nPressure = 600 Pa = 600 N/m\u00b2\n\nSurface area = 145,000,000 km\u00b2 = 145,000,000 \u00d7 1,000,000 m\u00b2 = 1.45 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 m\u00b2\n\nGravity = 4 m/s\u00b2\n\nMass = (600 \u00d7 1.45 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074) / 4\n\nCalculate numerator: 600 \u00d7 1.45 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 = 870 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 = 8.7 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2076 kg\n\nThen, 8.7 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2076 / 4 = 2.175 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2076 kg\n\nSo, approximately 2.175 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2076 kg, which is closest to option D, 2.2 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2076 kg.\n\nWait, earlier I had a mistake in multiplying 150 \u00d7 1.45.\n\nLet's see:\n\n600 / 4 = 150\n\n150 \u00d7 1.45:\n\n150 \u00d7 1 = 150\n\n150 \u00d7 0.4 = 60\n\n150 \u00d7 0.05 = 7.5\n\nAdd them up: 150 + 60 + 7.5 = 217.5\n\nSo, 217.5 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 kg = 2.175 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2077 kg\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 2.175 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2076 kg.\n\nAh, I see the mistake. When multiplying 150 \u00d7 1.45, I should get 217.5, and then 217.5 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 kg is indeed 2.175 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2077 kg, but in the first calculation, I considered it as 2.175 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2077 kg, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. 217.5 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 is indeed 2.175 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2077 kg, but in the first step, I had Mass = (600 \u00d7 1.45 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074) / 4.\n\nSo, 600 / 4 = 150\n\nThen, 150 \u00d7 1.45 = 217.5\n\nSo, 217.5 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 kg = 2.175 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2077 kg\n\nBut that doesn't match the earlier calculation. There must be a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute it differently.\n\nPressure = 600 Pa = 600 N/m\u00b2\n\nSurface area = 145,000,000 km\u00b2 = 145,000,000 \u00d7 1,000,000 m\u00b2 = 1.45 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 m\u00b2\n\nGravity = 4 m/s\u00b2\n\nMass = Pressure \u00d7 Area / Gravity = 600 \u00d7 1.45 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 / 4\n\nCalculate numerator: 600 \u00d7 1.45 = 870\n\nThen, 870 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 / 4 = 217.5 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 kg = 2.175 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2076 kg\n\nWait, now I'm getting 2.175 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2076 kg, which matches option D.\n\nEarlier, I must have miswritten the units or miscalculated.\n\nSo, the correct mass should be approximately 2.175 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2076 kg, which is closest to option D, 2.2 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2076 kg.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 2.2x1016 kg.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 2.2 \\times 10^{16} \\ \\text{kg}} \\]"
