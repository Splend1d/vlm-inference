                    "text": "I've got this problem here: find the smallest positive integer \\( n > 1 \\) such that the product of all its positive divisors is \\( n^6 \\). The options are 30, 64, 2048, and 60. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I recall that for any positive integer \\( n \\), the product of its positive divisors is \\( n^{t(n)/2} \\), where \\( t(n) \\) is the number of positive divisors of \\( n \\). So, if the product of the divisors is \\( n^6 \\), that means \\( n^{t(n)/2} = n^6 \\). I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\nn^{t(n)/2} = n^6\n\\]\n\nSince the bases are the same, I can equate the exponents:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{t(n)}{2} = 6 \\implies t(n) = 12\n\\]\n\nSo, I need to find the smallest \\( n > 1 \\) that has exactly 12 positive divisors.\n\nNext, I should recall how to find the number of positive divisors of a number. If \\( n \\) has a prime factorization of \\( n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\dots p_k^{a_k} \\), then the number of positive divisors is:\n\n\\[\nt(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\dots (a_k + 1) = 12\n\\]\n\nSo, I need to find the exponents \\( a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k \\) such that the product \\( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\dots (a_k + 1) = 12 \\).\n\nLet's list all possible combinations of \\( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\dots (a_k + 1) = 12 \\):\n\n1. \\( 12 = 12 \\): This would correspond to a prime power \\( p^{11} \\), but since \\( n > 1 \\), and considering the options, this is unlikely.\n\n2. \\( 12 = 6 \\times 2 \\): So, \\( n = p^{5} q^{1} \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes.\n\n3. \\( 12 = 4 \\times 3 \\): So, \\( n = p^{3} q^{2} \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes.\n\n4. \\( 12 = 3 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\): So, \\( n = p^{2} q^{1} r^{1} \\), where \\( p, q, r \\) are distinct primes.\n\nThese are the possible forms for \\( n \\).\n\nNow, I need to find the smallest \\( n \\) among the given options that fits one of these forms.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. 30\n\nB. 64\n\nC. 2048\n\nD. 60\n\nFirst, let's factorize each option to see their prime factorizations and determine \\( t(n) \\).\n\nOption A: 30\n\n\\( 30 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\)\n\nSo, \\( n = 2^{1} \\times 3^{1} \\times 5^{1} \\)\n\nThus, \\( t(n) = (1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 8 \\), which is not 12.\n\nOption B: 64\n\n\\( 64 = 2^{6} \\)\n\nSo, \\( n = 2^{6} \\)\n\nThus, \\( t(n) = 7 \\), which is not 12.\n\nOption C: 2048\n\n\\( 2048 = 2^{11} \\)\n\nSo, \\( n = 2^{11} \\)\n\nThus, \\( t(n) = 12 \\), which matches.\n\nOption D: 60\n\n\\( 60 = 2^{2} \\times 3^{1} \\times 5^{1} \\)\n\nThus, \\( t(n) = (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12 \\), which matches.\n\nSo, among the options, both 2048 and 60 have exactly 12 positive divisors. Now, I need to find the smallest one, which is 60.\n\nBut wait a minute, the problem asks for the smallest positive integer \\( n > 1 \\) with this property, and among the options, 60 is smaller than 2048. However, I should confirm if there are smaller numbers outside the options that also have 12 divisors, but since the problem specifies the options, and 60 is among them, 60 should be the answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check if there are smaller numbers with 12 divisors.\n\nConsider \\( n = 48 \\):\n\n\\( 48 = 2^{4} \\times 3^{1} \\)\n\n\\( t(n) = (4+1)(1+1) = 10 \\), which is not 12.\n\n\\( n = 54 \\):\n\n\\( 54 = 2^{1} \\times 3^{3} \\)\n\n\\( t(n) = (1+1)(3+1) = 8 \\), not 12.\n\n\\( n = 56 \\):\n\n\\( 56 = 2^{3} \\times 7^{1} \\)\n\n\\( t(n) = (3+1)(1+1) = 8 \\), not 12.\n\n\\( n = 60 \\):\n\nAlready checked, \\( t(n) = 12 \\).\n\nSo, indeed, 60 is the smallest among the options with 12 divisors.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 60.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
