                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this economics problem: If my nominal income rises 4 percent and my real income falls 1 percent, by how much did the price level change? The options are a 5 percent decrease, a quarter percent increase, a 3 percent increase, or a 5 percent increase.\n\nHmm, I need to recall the relationships between nominal income, real income, and the price level. I know that nominal income is my income in current dollars, while real income adjusts for inflation and reflects the purchasing power of my income.\n\nThe relationship between nominal income, real income, and the price level can be expressed using the formula:\n\nReal Income = Nominal Income / Price Level\n\nOr, to find the percentage changes:\n\nPercentage change in Real Income = Percentage change in Nominal Income - Percentage change in Price Level\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think about it.\n\nActually, I think it's more accurate to use the formula:\n\n\u0394Real Income % = \u0394Nominal Income % - \u0394Price Level %\n\nWhere \u0394 denotes the percentage change.\n\nSo, if I plug in the given numbers:\n\n-1% = 4% - \u0394Price Level %\n\nThen, \u0394Price Level % = 4% - (-1%) = 4% + 1% = 5%\n\nSo, the price level increased by 5 percent.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure I have the signs correct. The formula should be:\n\n\u0394Real Income % = \u0394Nominal Income % - \u0394Price Level %\n\nGiven that, with a fall in real income (-1%), and a rise in nominal income (4%), the price level must have increased, and the calculation suggests a 5% increase.\n\nBut let's verify this with an example.\n\nSuppose initial nominal income is $100, and the initial price level is 100.\n\nThen, initial real income is $100 / 1 = $100.\n\nNow, nominal income rises by 4%, so new nominal income is $100 * 1.04 = $104.\n\nReal income falls by 1%, so new real income is $100 * 0.99 = $99.\n\nNow, if real income is $99 and nominal income is $104, then the new price level P is given by:\n\n$99 = $104 / P\n\nSo, P = $104 / $99 \u2248 1.0505...\n\nThat means the price level increased to approximately 105.05, which is a 5.05% increase from the initial 100.\n\nSo, this matches the earlier calculation of a 5% increase in the price level.\n\nWait, but the options include 5% decrease, \u00bc% increase, 3% increase, and 5% increase. Based on this calculation, it seems like the price level increased by 5%, which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might use the formula:\n\n\u0394Real Income % \u2248 \u0394Nominal Income % - \u0394Price Level %\n\nBut in this case, since we're dealing with percentage changes, the approximation should hold for small changes.\n\nGiven that, the calculation should be accurate for small percentage changes.\n\nAnother way to look at it is through the inflation rate, where inflation is the percentage change in the price level.\n\nSo, if the price level increases by 5%, that's the inflation rate.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 5 percent increase.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other relationship or formula that might apply here.\n\nPerhaps using the real income formula:\n\nReal Income = Nominal Income / Price Level\n\nIf we let P be the price level, then:\n\nReal Income = Nominal Income / P\n\nGiven that Nominal Income increased by 4% and Real Income decreased by 1%, we can set up the equation:\n\nNew Real Income = New Nominal Income / New P\n\nBut we know New Real Income = Old Real Income * (1 - 0.01) = Old Real Income * 0.99\n\nAnd New Nominal Income = Old Nominal Income * 1.04\n\nSo:\n\n0.99 * Old Real Income = 1.04 * Old Nominal Income / New P\n\nBut Old Real Income = Old Nominal Income / Old P\n\nSo:\n\n0.99 * (Old Nominal Income / Old P) = 1.04 * Old Nominal Income / New P\n\nWe can cancel Old Nominal Income from both sides:\n\n0.99 / Old P = 1.04 / New P\n\nThen, New P = (1.04 / 0.99) * Old P \u2248 1.0505 * Old P\n\nSo, New P is approximately 105.05% of Old P, which again confirms a 5% increase in the price level.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 5 percent increase.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
