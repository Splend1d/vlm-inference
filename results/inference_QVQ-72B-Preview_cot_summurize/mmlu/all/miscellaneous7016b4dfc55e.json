Hmm, I need to recall my World War II history here.\n\nI know that the Axis powers were led by Germany, Italy, and Japan during World War II. So, Germany and Japan are definitely part of the Axis. Italy joined them as well, if I remember correctly. But what about Spain? Did Spain officially join the Axis alliance?\n\nLet me think about this. Spain was ruled by Francisco Franco during that time, and he was a dictator, much like Hitler and Mussolini. But did Spain become an official member of the Axis powers?\n\nI think Spain provided some support to the Axis, maybe sent volunteers or something, but I don't think they were\u6b63\u5f0f\u7684\u6210\u5458 of the Axis alliance. Let me see if I can remember any specific treaties or agreements they had.\n\nOh, wait, I think Spain was neutral during World War II, or at least they didn't officially declare war on the Allies. But they had close ties with Germany and Italy because of their fascist ideologies.\n\nLet me consider this more carefully. If Germany, Italy, and Japan were the core members of the Axis, and Spain wasn't part of that official alliance, then Spain would be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should think about whether Spain had any formal agreements or was involved in any military actions alongside the Axis powers.\n\nI recall that Spain sent the Blue Division to fight alongside the Germans in the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union, but that was more of a volunteer force rather than a formal military commitment by the Spanish state.\n\nAlso, after the war, Spain didn't face the same repercussions as the official Axis members, which suggests that they weren't officially part of the Axis alliance.\n\nSo, based on that, I think Spain was not a member of the Axis alliance during World War II.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there were any other countries that joined the Axis later on. For example, I think Romania and Hungary joined the Axis at some point, but they're not in this list.\n\nSimilarly, Bulgaria and Finland had\u5408\u4f5c\u5173\u7cfb with the Axis, but again, they're not in this options.\n\nSo, given the options provided\u2014Germany, Italy, Spain, and Japan\u2014I can confidently say that Spain was not a member of the Axis alliance during World War II.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll recall that the Axis powers were primarily Germany, Italy, and Japan, with some other countries joining later, but Spain wasn't one of them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Spain.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
