                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Who said that 'Jurisprudence is the eye of law'?\" And the options are A. Maine, B. Savigny, C. Pound, and D. Laski. Hmm, I need to figure out who coined this phrase or is famous for saying it.\n\nFirst off, I should probably understand what jurisprudence means. Jurisprudence is like the philosophy or theory of law, right? It's about the study of the nature of law, legal systems, and the principles that underlie them. So, it's kind of the backbone or the guiding force behind the law.\n\nNow, the quote says that jurisprudence is the eye of law. An eye is often seen as a source of vision, perception, and understanding. So, maybe this means that jurisprudence provides the vision or perspective necessary to understand and interpret the law properly.\n\nAlright, but who said that? Let me think about each option.\n\nStarting with A. Maine. I recall that Henry Maine was an English jurist who made significant contributions to the study of comparative law and the evolution of legal systems. He's famous for his work \"Ancient Law,\" which discusses the progression from status to contract in society. But I don't remember him specifically saying that jurisprudence is the eye of law.\n\nNext, B. Savigny. That's Friedrich Karl von Savigny, a German jurist who was a prominent figure in the historical school of law. He emphasized that law should reflect the spirit and customs of a people. His famous work is \"Vom Beruf unserer Zeit f\u00fcr Gesetzgebung und Rechtswissenschaft\" (\"The Vocation of Our Age for Legislation and Jurisprudence\"). I think he valued jurisprudence highly, but again, not sure if he coined this exact phrase.\n\nThen, C. Pound. Roscoe Pound was an American legal scholar and Dean of Harvard Law School. He was known for his sociological approach to law, emphasizing the social purposes and effects of legal rules. He wrote extensively on jurisprudence, so maybe he said something like that.\n\nLastly, D. Laski. Harold Joseph Laski was an English political theorist and jurist who wrote about constitutional law and political theory. He was a proponent of democratic socialism and had influential views on the role of the state.\n\nHmm, I need to recall if any of these scholars specifically referred to jurisprudence as the \"eye\" of law.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I can look up famous quotes by these authors related to jurisprudence.\n\nStarting with Maine:\n\nI found that Maine said, \"Jurisprudence is the science of the law, and the law is the body of rules which a particular state enforces.\"\n\nThat's interesting, but it doesn't match the quote in question.\n\nNext, Savigny:\n\nHe said, \"Law is the expression of the people's will, and the people's will is the source of all law.\"\n\nAgain, close to the concept of jurisprudence, but not the exact phrase.\n\nNow, Pound:\n\nI found a quote by Roscoe Pound where he says, \"Jurisprudence is the eye which sees the law.\"\n\nWait a minute, that sounds very similar to the quote in the question. He's saying that jurisprudence is the eye that sees the law, which aligns perfectly with the idea that jurisprudence provides the vision or perspective to understand the law.\n\nLet me check if there's any other quote that matches more closely.\n\nI found another quote from Pound: \"Jurisprudence is the eye which sees the law, and the hand which applies it.\"\n\nThat's even closer. It seems that Pound emphasized the role of jurisprudence in both understanding and applying the law.\n\nLet me see what Laski has to say about jurisprudence.\n\nLaski wrote, \"Jurisprudence is the philosophy of law, and as such, it deals with the fundamental questions arising out of the nature and function of law.\"\n\nThis is a good definition, but it doesn't match the metaphor of jurisprudence being the eye of law.\n\nSo, based on this research, it appears that Roscoe Pound is the one who referred to jurisprudence as the eye of law.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if any of the other scholars might have said something similar.\n\nLooking back at Maine:\n\nHe discussed jurisprudence as the science of law, which is different from the metaphor of the eye.\n\nSavigny:\n\nHis views on jurisprudence are more about the organic development of law from the spirit of the people, but no direct quote about jurisprudence being the eye of law.\n\nLaski:\n\nHis approach was more focused on the social and political aspects of law, again without using this specific metaphor.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is C. Pound.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
