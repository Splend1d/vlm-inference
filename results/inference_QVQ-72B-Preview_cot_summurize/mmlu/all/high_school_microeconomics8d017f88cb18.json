                    "text": "Let's see. So, we have an apple market that's initially in equilibrium. Then two things happen: apple growers start using more pesticides to increase apple production, and at the same time, the price of pears (which are a substitute for apples) is rising. We need to figure out what happens to the price and quantity of apples.\n\nFirst, let's think about each event separately.\n\nStarting with the increase in pesticide use by apple growers to increase production. Pesticides help protect plants from pests and diseases, which can lead to higher yields. So, if growers are using more pesticides, that should lead to an increase in apple supply. In supply and demand terms, this would shift the supply curve to the right, right? Because there's more apples available at every price.\n\nNow, simultaneously, the price of pears is rising. Pears are a substitute for apples. When the price of a substitute goes up, what happens to the demand for the original product? Well, if pears are more expensive, people might switch to apples, thinking apples are relatively cheaper. So, that should increase the demand for apples, shifting the demand curve to the right.\n\nSo, we have both supply and demand increasing. But we need to figure out how these two shifts affect the equilibrium price and quantity of apples.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. I need a supply and demand graph for apples.\n\nInitially, we have supply (S) and demand (D), intersecting at equilibrium price P and quantity Q.\n\nThen, supply increases due to more pesticide use, so supply shifts to S'. At the same time, demand increases due to the rise in pear prices, so demand shifts to D'.\n\nNow, depending on the magnitude of these shifts, the new equilibrium (P', Q') could be different in different scenarios.\n\nBut the question is asking for a reasonable prediction, and it gives options about the price and quantity being ambiguous or not.\n\nOption A says price rises, but quantity is ambiguous.\n\nOption B says price falls, but quantity is ambiguous.\n\nOption C says price is ambiguous, but quantity rises.\n\nOption D says price is ambiguous, but quantity falls.\n\nHmm.\n\nSince both supply and demand are increasing, the effect on price is ambiguous because it depends on the relative sizes of the shifts.\n\nIf supply increases more than demand, the price might fall.\n\nIf demand increases more than supply, the price might rise.\n\nIf they increase by similar proportions, the price might stay about the same.\n\nBut the quantity demanded and supplied both increase, so quantity should rise.\n\nWait, but the question says \"quantity is ambiguous,\" which suggests that it's not necessarily clear whether quantity rises or falls.\n\nBut in standard supply and demand analysis, if both curves shift to the right, the equilibrium quantity must increase. It can't decrease.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nSuppose supply shifts right to S' and demand shifts right to D'.\n\nThe new equilibrium is where S' and D' intersect.\n\nIf both shifts are to the right, the quantity must increase.\n\nThe price, however, could go up, down, or stay the same, depending on the slopes and the extent of the shifts.\n\nSo, in that case, quantity should definitely rise, and price is ambiguous.\n\nThat would make option C the correct one: price is ambiguous, but quantity rises.\n\nBut wait, option C says \"price is ambiguous, but quantity rises,\" which matches what I just thought.\n\nOption A says price rises, quantity ambiguous.\n\nOption B says price falls, quantity ambiguous.\n\nOption D says price ambiguous, quantity falls.\n\nSo, between these, option C seems correct.\n\nBut let me think again.\n\nIs it possible for quantity to decrease if both supply and demand increase?\n\nI don't think so in standard supply and demand analysis.\n\nUnless there's something unusual about the shifts, like one shifting more than the other in a particular way.\n\nBut generally, if both supply and demand increase, quantity should increase.\n\nTherefore, option C is likely correct: price is ambiguous, but quantity rises.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a scenario where quantity could decrease.\n\nLet me consider the extremes.\n\nSuppose demand increases by a lot, and supply increases by a little.\n\nThen, price would rise, and quantity would rise.\n\nIf supply increases by a lot, and demand by a little, price would fall, and quantity would still rise.\n\nIt's hard to imagine a scenario where quantity decreases when both supply and demand increase.\n\nMaybe if supply increases infinitely, but that's not realistic.\n\nSo, yeah, I think quantity must rise, and price is ambiguous.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\nPrice is ambiguous, but quantity rises.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
