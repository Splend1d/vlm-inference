                    "text": "So I've got this question here about choosing the most appropriate measure of general cognitive abilities for a nonverbal adolescent. The options are the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales\u20135, the Leiter-R, the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children\u2013II, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children\u2013IV. I need to pick the one that's best suited for someone who doesn't use verbal communication.\n\nFirst off, I should probably understand what each of these tests is designed for and whether they cater to nonverbal individuals.\n\nStarting with the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales\u20135, I recall that this is a well-known test that assesses intelligence and cognitive abilities in individuals from infants to adults. It covers areas like fluid reasoning, knowledge, quantitative reasoning, visual-spatial processing, and working memory. However, I think it relies quite heavily on verbal responses and may not be the best fit for someone who is nonverbal.\n\nNext is the Leiter-R. I'm not as familiar with this one, but I believe it's a nonverbal intelligence test that uses visual problem-solving tasks. It's designed to assess the intelligence of individuals who may have difficulties with language, either because they're young, have a disability, or are from a different linguistic background. This sounds promising for a nonverbal adolescent.\n\nThen there's the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children\u2013II. I know that this test is designed to evaluate cognitive abilities in children and adolescents, and it includes both verbal and nonverbal subtests. It's meant to be flexible and can be adapted for use with individuals who have communication difficulties. So, it seems like it could be a good option as well.\n\nLastly, there's the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children\u2013IV. I'm familiar with the Wechsler scales; they're widely used to assess intelligence in children and teens. They typically involve both verbal and performance (nonverbal) subtests. However, since the individual in question is nonverbal, relying on the performance subtests only might not give a comprehensive assessment, but it could still be usable with some adaptations.\n\nSo, comparing these options:\n\n- Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales\u20135: While it's a comprehensive test, it might be too verbally demanding for a nonverbal adolescent.\n\n- Leiter-R: Specifically designed as a nonverbal intelligence test, making it suitable for individuals without verbal skills.\n\n- Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children\u2013II: Offers a balance of verbal and nonverbal subtests and can be adjusted for nonverbal individuals.\n\n- Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children\u2013IV: Primarily designed with both verbal and performance subtests, but could be used focusing only on the nonverbal aspects.\n\nGiven that the adolescent is nonverbal, the Leiter-R seems like a strong candidate because it's specifically designed for nonverbal assessment. The Kaufman also offers flexibility in accommodating nonverbal individuals, but since the Leiter-R is entirely nonverbal, it might be more straightforward and reliable for this population.\n\nI should also consider the age range for each test. The Leiter-R is typically used for individuals from 2 years old up to adulthood, which covers adolescents. The Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children\u2013II is designed for ages 3 to 18 years and 11 months, so it also fits within the adolescent age group.\n\nThe Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales\u20135 covers a broad age range from 2 years old to adulthood, but as mentioned earlier, it may not be the best choice for nonverbal individuals due to its verbal components.\n\nThe Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children\u2013IV is intended for children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years and 11 months, which aligns with the adolescent age group.\n\nConsidering all this, the Leiter-R seems to be the most appropriate choice because it's specifically designed as a nonverbal intelligence test, making it ideal for assessing cognitive abilities in individuals who do not use verbal communication.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll look up a bit more information about each test to confirm my understanding.\n\nFirst, the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales\u20135: Yes, it does include nonverbal subtests, but verbal subtests are also a significant part of the assessment. So, while it can assess nonverbal abilities, it might not be as effective or efficient for a completely nonverbal individual.\n\nThe Leiter-R is indeed a nonverbal intelligence test that uses visual problem-solving tasks to assess intelligence. It's often used with individuals who have hearing impairments, autism, or other conditions that affect verbal communication.\n\nThe Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children\u2013II is designed to be flexible and can be used with individuals who have communication disorders. It includes both verbal and nonverbal subtests, allowing for adaptation to the needs of nonverbal individuals.\n\nThe Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children\u2013IV is similar in that it has both verbal and performance (nonverbal) subtests. However, for a completely nonverbal adolescent, relying solely on the performance subtests might not provide a comprehensive assessment of their cognitive abilities.\n\nTherefore, based on this additional research, my initial conclusion holds: the Leiter-R is the most appropriate measure for a nonverbal adolescent.\n\nOne more thing to consider is the cultural and linguistic background of the adolescent. Since they are nonverbal, their background might not directly affect the assessment as much as it would for someone relying on language. However, it's still important to use a test that minimizes cultural biases and relies on universal problem-solving skills, which the Leiter-R aims to do.\n\nAlso, I should think about the purpose of the assessment. If the goal is to measure general cognitive abilities, all of these tests aim to do that. However, the Leiter-R's focus on nonverbal reasoning makes it particularly suitable for nonverbal individuals.\n\nAnother factor could be the availability of trained administrators and the time required for administration. But since the question is about choosing the most appropriate test, not about practical considerations, I'll set that aside.\n\nIn summary, based on the needs of the nonverbal adolescent and the characteristics of each test, the Leiter-R is the best choice among the given options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
