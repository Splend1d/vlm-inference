                    "text": "So I need to figure out the name of this 1999 art exhibit that caused a big stir about censorship. The options are \"Sticks & Stones,\" \"Pulsation,\" \"Black & White,\" and \"Sensation.\" Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I remember that sometimes art exhibits can be controversial because they push boundaries or tackle sensitive subjects. Censorship debates usually come up when people disagree about what should be allowed to be shown in public spaces.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. \"Sticks & Stones\" \u2013 That sounds like it might involve some kind of commentary on language or perhaps bullying, since the phrase \"sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me\" is well-known. But I don't recall a specific exhibit by that name that caused a national debate about censorship in 1999.\n\nB. \"Pulsation\" \u2013 This could be about something that pulses, like heartbeats or maybe light installations. It doesn't sound particularly controversial, but maybe it had elements that some people found offensive. Still, I don't have any immediate recollection of it being a center of censorship debates.\n\nC. \"Black & White\" \u2013 This could refer to racial issues, given the common association of black and white with race relations. It might also refer to photography, but again, I don't remember a specific exhibit from 1999 that caused such a debate.\n\nD. \"Sensation\" \u2013 This one rings a bell. I think there was an exhibit called \"Sensation\" that was shown in Brooklyn in 1999. It was a contemporary art exhibit that featured works by several artists, and I recall that some of the pieces were quite provocative.\n\nLet me dig a little deeper into \"Sensation.\" I believe it was organized by the Sensation Trust, which was supported by Charles Saatchi, the famous art collector. The exhibit traveled from London to Brooklyn, and when it arrived in New York, it caused quite a stir.\n\nOne of the most controversial pieces in the exhibit was a sculpture by Damien Hirst called \"The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living,\" which is a shark preserved in formaldehyde. Another provocative work was Chris Ofili's \"The Holy Virgin Mary,\" which included elephant dung and pornographic images, and that really ignited the censorship debate.\n\nIn fact, Rudolph Giuliani, who was the Mayor of New York at the time, was heavily involved in the controversy. He was outraged by some of the artworks, particularly \"The Holy Virgin Mary,\" and threatened to cut funding to the Brooklyn Museum where the exhibit was being shown. This led to a major legal battle over First Amendment rights and the limits of artistic expression.\n\nThe debate surrounding \"Sensation\" became a significant moment in the discussion about censorship in art, pitting advocates of free expression against those who believed that public funds should not be used to support what they considered to be offensive or blasphemous art.\n\nSo, based on this background, it seems pretty clear that \"Sensation\" is the exhibit being referred to in the question. Let me just double-check to make sure there isn't any confusion.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \"Sticks & Stones\" \u2013 Doesn't ring a bell in the context of a major censorship debate in 1999.\n\nB. \"Pulsation\" \u2013 No immediate association with a controversial art exhibit from that time.\n\nC. \"Black & White\" \u2013 Could be about race, but I don't recall a specific exhibit by that name causing a national debate in 1999.\n\nD. \"Sensation\" \u2013 Definitely\u8bb0\u5f97 this exhibit and the controversies it sparked, especially in New York.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. \"Sensation.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
