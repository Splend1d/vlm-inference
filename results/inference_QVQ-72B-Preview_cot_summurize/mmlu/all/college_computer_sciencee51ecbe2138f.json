                    "text": "So I've got this problem about a hash table with 5 buckets, numbered 0 through 4. The hash function is h(i) = i mod 5, and it uses linear probing to handle collisions. That means if a bucket is already full, it looks at the next bucket, and wraps around if needed, since it's modulo 5.\n\nI need to insert keys 13, 8, 24, 10, and 3 in that order into an initially empty hash table, and then figure out what's in bucket number 2.\n\nFirst, I should understand how hashing and linear probing work. Hashing maps a key to a bucket using the hash function, and if that bucket is already occupied, linear probing checks the next bucket, and keeps going until it finds an empty one.\n\nSo, let's go through each insertion step by step.\n\nStarting with an empty table: [ , , , , ]\n\nFirst key: 13\n\nHash function: h(13) = 13 mod 5 = 3\n\nBucket 3 is empty, so place 13 there.\n\nTable: [ , , , 13, ]\n\nNext key: 8\n\nHash function: h(8) = 8 mod 5 = 3\n\nBut bucket 3 is already occupied by 13. So, use linear probing: move to bucket 4.\n\nBucket 4 is empty, so place 8 there.\n\nTable: [ , , , 13, 8]\n\nNext key: 24\n\nHash function: h(24) = 24 mod 5 = 4\n\nBucket 4 is occupied by 8. So, linear probing: move to bucket 0.\n\nBucket 0 is empty, so place 24 there.\n\nTable: [24, , , 13, 8]\n\nNext key: 10\n\nHash function: h(10) = 10 mod 5 = 0\n\nBut bucket 0 is already occupied by 24. So, linear probing: move to bucket 1.\n\nBucket 1 is empty, so place 10 there.\n\nTable: [24, 10, , 13, 8]\n\nNext key: 3\n\nHash function: h(3) = 3 mod 5 = 3\n\nBucket 3 is occupied by 13. So, linear probing: move to bucket 4.\n\nBucket 4 is occupied by 8. So, continue probing: move to bucket 0.\n\nBucket 0 is occupied by 24. So, move to bucket 1.\n\nBucket 1 is occupied by 10. So, move to bucket 2.\n\nBucket 2 is empty, so place 3 there.\n\nTable: [24, 10, 3, 13, 8]\n\nNow, the question is asking for the content of bucket number 2, which is 3.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 3\n\nB. 8\n\nC. 10\n\nD. 13\n\nSo, the correct answer should be A. 3.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with an empty table:\n\nInsert 13: h(13)=3, bucket 3 empty \u2192 13\n\nTable: [ , , , 13, ]\n\nInsert 8: h(8)=3, occupied \u2192 probe bucket 4, empty \u2192 8\n\nTable: [ , , , 13, 8]\n\nInsert 24: h(24)=4, occupied \u2192 probe bucket 0, empty \u2192 24\n\nTable: [24, , , 13, 8]\n\nInsert 10: h(10)=0, occupied \u2192 probe bucket 1, empty \u2192 10\n\nTable: [24, 10, , 13, 8]\n\nInsert 3: h(3)=3, occupied \u2192 probe bucket 4, occupied \u2192 probe bucket 0, occupied \u2192 probe bucket 1, occupied \u2192 probe bucket 2, empty \u2192 3\n\nTable: [24, 10, 3, 13, 8]\n\nYes, bucket 2 has 3.\n\nSo, the answer is A. 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
