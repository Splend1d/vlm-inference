                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a scale model of a park. It says that the scale is 1.5 centimeters to 50 meters, and I need to find out what a real distance of 150 meters would be on the model. The options are 0.5 cm, 4.5 cm, 75 cm, and 225 cm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the scale means. It says 1.5 centimeters on the model represents 50 meters in real life. So, for every 1.5 cm on the model, it corresponds to 50 meters in the actual park.\n\nI need to find out how many 50-meter segments there are in 150 meters. Let's see, 150 divided by 50 is 3. So, 150 meters is three times 50 meters.\n\nSince 1.5 cm represents 50 meters, then for three times that, it should be 1.5 cm multiplied by 3. Let me calculate that: 1.5 times 3 is 4.5 centimeters.\n\nSo, the distance between the two trees on the model should be 4.5 centimeters.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that. Maybe I can approach it differently to confirm.\n\nI know that the scale is 1.5 cm to 50 meters. That means that every 1.5 cm on the model corresponds to 50 meters in reality.\n\nSo, if I have a real distance of 150 meters, I can set up a proportion to find out what that distance would be on the model.\n\nThe proportion would be:\n\n1.5 cm / 50 m = x cm / 150 m\n\nSo, x cm is the distance on the model that represents 150 meters.\n\nTo solve for x, I can cross-multiply:\n\n1.5 cm * 150 m = 50 m * x cm\n\nThat gives:\n\n225 cm*m = 50 m*x cm\n\nNow, divide both sides by 50 m:\n\n225 cm*m / 50 m = x cm\n\nSimplify that:\n\n(225 / 50) cm = x cm\n\n225 divided by 50 is 4.5, so x = 4.5 cm\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it, maybe to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nAnother approach could be to find out how many times 50 meters fits into 150 meters and then multiply that by the model distance for one 50-meter segment.\n\nSo, 150 m / 50 m = 3\n\nThen, 3 * 1.5 cm = 4.5 cm\n\nAgain, I get 4.5 cm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can set up the ratio differently.\n\nThe scale is 1.5 cm to 50 m. I need to find the model distance for 150 m.\n\nSo, if 1.5 cm represents 50 m, then per meter, it would be 1.5 cm / 50 m.\n\nThen, for 150 m, it would be 1.5 cm / 50 m * 150 m.\n\nThat simplifies to 1.5 cm * 150 m / 50 m.\n\n150 divided by 50 is 3, so again, 1.5 cm * 3 = 4.5 cm.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider units to make sure I'm not mixing anything up.\n\n1.5 cm represents 50 m.\n\nNeed to find model distance for 150 m.\n\nFirst, convert everything to the same unit. Maybe convert meters to centimeters to avoid confusion.\n\n1 meter = 100 centimeters.\n\nSo, 50 m = 50 * 100 cm = 5000 cm.\n\nSo, the scale is 1.5 cm on model represents 5000 cm in reality.\n\nNow, 150 m = 150 * 100 cm = 15000 cm.\n\nSo, the ratio is 1.5 cm on model to 5000 cm in reality.\n\nTherefore, for every 5000 cm in reality, it's 1.5 cm on the model.\n\nSo, for 15000 cm in reality, the model distance would be (1.5 cm / 5000 cm) * 15000 cm.\n\nSimplify that:\n\nFirst, 1.5 cm / 5000 cm = 0.0003 per cm.\n\nThen, 0.0003 * 15000 cm = 4.5 cm.\n\nAgain, I get 4.5 cm.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently through different methods.\n\nLet me just quickly check if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nIs the scale 1.5 cm to 50 m, meaning 1.5 cm represents 50 m, or could it be interpreted differently?\n\nI don't think so; it seems straightforward.\n\nAlso, checking the options:\n\nA. 0.5 centimeter\n\nB. 4.5 centimeters\n\nC. 75 centimeters\n\nD. 225 centimeters\n\n4.5 cm is one of the options, which aligns with my calculations.\n\nI don't think it's 0.5 cm because that's much smaller than what the scale suggests.\n\n75 cm seems too big, as does 225 cm, given the scale provided.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 4.5 centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
