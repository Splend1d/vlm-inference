Coccyx.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these is in the wrist. Let me think about it.\n\nFirst, I should recall what bones are in the wrist. The wrist is part of the hand, right? So, anatomically, it's between the forearm and the hand. I think there are several small bones there, but I might not remember all of them.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A is the patella. I know that the patella is the kneecap. It's located in the leg, specifically in the knee joint. So, that's definitely not in the wrist. Maybe I can eliminate that one.\n\nOption B is the humerus. The humerus is the bone in the upper arm, connecting the shoulder to the elbow. Again, that's not in the wrist. It's higher up in the arm.\n\nOption C is the carpals. Now, I think carpals are the wrist bones. Let me confirm that. Yes, the carpal bones are the small bones that make up the wrist. There are eight of them, I believe, arranged in two rows of four. They connect the radius and ulna of the forearm to the metacarpal bones of the hand. So, that seems like a good fit for the wrist.\n\nOption D is the coccyx. The coccyx is the tailbone, located at the bottom of the spinal column, in the pelvis area. That's definitely not in the wrist.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option C, the carpals, are the bones located in the wrist. Just to make sure, maybe I should double-check.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that one of the other bones could be considered part of the wrist indirectly or something? For example, sometimes people might refer to nearby bones, but I don't think so. The patella is clearly in the knee, the humerus in the upper arm, and the coccyx in the pelvis. So, no, I don't think there's any ambiguity there.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Carpals.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly summarize what I know about each bone:\n\n- A. Patella: Kneecap, part of the leg.\n\n- B. Humerus: Upper arm bone, between the shoulder and the elbow.\n\n- C. Carpals: Wrist bones, connecting the forearm to the hand.\n\n- D. Coccyx: Tailbone, part of the spinal column in the pelvis.\n\nYes, that reinforces my conclusion that carpals are the bones located in the wrist.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is C. Carpals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
