                    "text": "So I've got this question about whether a small dry cleaning store has to follow the federal minimum wage law. The law says it applies to all dry cleaning stores, and there are some findings that the wages of these workers affect the national economy and interstate commerce. But this particular store is small, operates only within its local community, and has no customers from outside the state. It has three workers who are paid less than the federal minimum wage. The question is, does this store have to comply with the statute?\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, I need to understand the basis for the federal statute. It's extending federal minimum wage requirements to all dry cleaning stores. And it has express findings that the wages of dry cleaning workers have a substantial impact on the national economy and on the flow of goods and services in interstate commerce. These findings are based on information presented to Congress during committee hearings.\n\nNow, the store in question is small, operates exclusively within its community, has no customers from outside the state, and employs three workers paid below the federal minimum wage. The options are:\n\nA. No, because the store does no business in interstate commerce.\n\nB. No, because the wages of the store's three workers do not have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\n\nC. Yes, because the commerce clause vests Congress with plenary legislative authority over labor relations.\n\nD. Yes, because the wages paid by dry cleaning stores have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\n\nHmm, I need to recall some constitutional law here, particularly regarding the Commerce Clause, which is in Article I, Section 8, of the U.S. Constitution. It gives Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states. Over time, the interpretation of this clause has expanded to include not just direct commerce across state lines but also activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.\n\nThere have been several Supreme Court cases that have shaped how we understand the Commerce Clause. One key doctrine is the \"substantial effect\" test, which allows Congress to regulate activities that, though local in nature, have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\n\nIn this case, the statute has express findings that the wages of dry cleaning workers have a substantial impact on the national economy and on the flow of goods and services in interstate commerce. So, based on that, it seems like Congress is invoking its authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate this aspect of the economy.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption A says no because the store does no business in interstate commerce. But according to the Commerce Clause, even if the store isn't directly engaged in interstate commerce, if its activities affect interstate commerce, Congress can regulate it.\n\nOption B says no because the wages of three workers don't have a substantial impact. But I think this is looking at it too narrowly. The statute is looking at the combined effect of all dry cleaning workers' wages, not just this one small store. So, even if individually the impact is small, collectively they might have a substantial impact.\n\nOption C says yes, because the commerce clause gives Congress plenary authority over labor relations. Plenary means complete or absolute. But I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate. While the Commerce Clause does give Congress broad regulatory powers, there are limits, especially regarding state sovereignty and individual liberties.\n\nOption D says yes, because the wages paid by dry cleaning stores have a substantial impact on interstate commerce. This seems to align with the statute's express findings and the Commerce Clause's substantial effect doctrine.\n\nBut wait, I need to think about the Supreme Court's rulings on the Commerce Clause. In United States v. Lopez (1995), the Court held that Congress cannot regulate noneconomic, violent criminal conduct based solely on the aggregate impact on the national economy. That case involved gun possession near schools. So, there are limits to Congress's Commerce Clause powers.\n\nHowever, in Gonzales v. Raich (2005), the Court upheld Congress's ability to regulate local marijuana cultivation intended for personal medical use, based on its effect on the national drug market. So, it's not entirely clear-cut.\n\nIn this scenario, the statute has express findings that the wages of dry cleaning workers have a substantial impact on the national economy and on the flow of goods and services in interstate commerce. These findings are supported by information presented to Congress.\n\nI think the key here is that Congress has made these findings, and courts generally defer to Congress's findings when it comes to the substantial effects on interstate commerce.\n\nSo, even though the individual store might have a minimal impact, the collective impact of all dry cleaning stores could be substantial, justifying Congress's regulation under the Commerce Clause.\n\nTherefore, the store would have to comply with the statute imposing the federal minimum wage requirements.\n\nLooking back at the options, Option D seems to be the correct answer: Yes, because the wages paid by dry cleaning stores have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\n\nOption C is a bit too broad, suggesting that Congress has plenary authority over labor relations, which isn't entirely accurate, as there are state regulations and other limitations.\n\nOptions A and B are arguing that the store doesn't have to comply because of its local nature or the minimal impact of its three workers, but as I understood, the regulation is based on the aggregate impact of all dry cleaning stores.\n\nSo, my final answer is D. Yes, because the wages paid by dry cleaning stores have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
