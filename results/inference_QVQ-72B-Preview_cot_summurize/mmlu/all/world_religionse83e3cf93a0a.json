                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which goddess is worshipped during the festival of Divali?\" And the options are A. Durga, B. Sri Lakshmi, C. Kali, D. Mahavira. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correctly associated with Divali.\n\nFirst off, I know that Divali is a major festival in Hinduism, right? It's also known as Diwali or Deepavali, and it's a festival of lights. It's celebrated by Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and some Buddhists. But primarily, it's a Hindu festival.\n\nNow, I need to recall which goddess is worshipped during this festival. Let's think about the significance of Divali. I remember that it marks the return of Lord Rama to Ayodhya after defeating Ravana, and the lights represent the celebration of his homecoming. So, it's a time for joy and victory of good over evil.\n\nBut which goddess is specifically worshipped during this time? Let's consider each option:\n\nA. Durga: She's a major goddess in Hinduism, associated with power and victory over evil. Durga Puja is a separate festival, mostly celebrated in Bengal, but not specifically during Divali. So, maybe not the primary goddess worshipped during Divali.\n\nB. Sri Lakshmi: She's the goddess of wealth, prosperity, and good fortune. I think she's heavily worshipped during Divali because the festival is also associated with wealth and prosperity. In fact, I recall that people clean their homes and decorate them with lights to welcome Lakshmi into their lives.\n\nC. Kali: Another powerful goddess, associated with time, creation, preservation, and destruction. Kali Puja is observed, but again, it's a separate festival, often celebrated alongside Divali in some regions, but not the primary goddess of Divali.\n\nD. Mahavira: Wait, Mahavira is the founder of Jainism. While Divali is celebrated by Jains as well, their celebrations might have different significance, such as commemorating Mahavira's attainment of moksha. But the primary goddess worshipped in the Hindu context of Divali is probably not Mahavira.\n\nSo, based on this, option B. Sri Lakshmi seems the most fitting answer. Worshipping Lakshmi during Divali makes sense because the festival is about welcoming wealth and prosperity into one's life.\n\nLet me double-check this. I recall that during Divali, families often perform Lakshmi Puja, where they worship the goddess Lakshmi, seeking her blessings for wealth and happiness. Additionally, they might also worship Lord Ganesha for good fortune and prosperity.\n\nBut the question specifies \"the festival of Divali,\" and while Ganesha is sometimes worshipped alongside Lakshmi, the primary goddess associated with Divali is indeed Lakshmi.\n\nAnother point: Divali is also connected to the legend of Lord Krishna defeating the demon Narakasura, and some regions celebrate it as the day when Lakshmi emerged from the churning of the ocean during the Samudra Manthan.\n\nMoreover, in business and commerce, Divali marks the beginning of the new financial year, and shops open their new account books after worshipping Lakshmi.\n\nTherefore, considering all these associations, it's clear that Sri Lakshmi is the goddess primarily worshipped during the festival of Divali.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"the goddess is worshipped during the festival of Divali.\" It doesn't specify \"primarily\" or \"mainly,\" but just \"worshipped during.\" So, while Lakshmi is indeed worshipped during Divali, so are other deities like Ganesha, Krishna, and in some places, Durga and Kali.\n\nHowever, Lakshmi is universally associated with Divali across Hindu traditions, whereas the others may have regional variations or secondary roles.\n\nGiven that, I think Sri Lakshmi is the most accurate answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any significance to the other goddesses during Divali.\n\nDurga: As I mentioned earlier, Durga Puja is a separate festival, primarily observed in Bengal, and not directly linked to Divali.\n\nKali: Kali Puja is sometimes observed on the day following Divali, especially in Bengal, but again, it's a separate celebration from Divali itself.\n\nMahavira: He is a central figure in Jainism, and while Jains celebrate Divali, their observations might include different practices and significances unrelated to worshipping a Hindu goddess.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the correct answer should be B. Sri Lakshmi.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Sri Lakshmi}} \\]"
