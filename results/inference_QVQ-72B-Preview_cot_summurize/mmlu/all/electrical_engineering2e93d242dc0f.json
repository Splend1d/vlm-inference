                    "text": "So I have this problem about a step-up chopper circuit. The input voltage is 110 volts, and the output voltage is 150 volts. I need to find the duty cycle, and there are four options to choose from. I'm a bit rusty on chopper circuits, but I remember that in a step-up chopper, also known as a boost converter, the output voltage is higher than the input voltage. There's a formula that relates the duty cycle to the input and output voltages.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the duty cycle in a step-up chopper. I think it's something like D = (V_o - V_i) / V_o, where D is the duty cycle, V_o is the output voltage, and V_i is the input voltage. Is that right? Let me verify that.\n\nIn a step-up chopper, the duty cycle is indeed related to the input and output voltages by that formula. So, D = (150 - 110) / 150. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 150 minus 110 is 40. Then, 40 divided by 150 is 0.2667. So, that would be approximately 0.27. Looking at the options, 0.27 is one of them, which is option D.\n\nWait a minute, is that the correct formula? I should double-check that because I don't want to get it wrong. Let me think again. In a step-up chopper, the relationship between input and output voltages is given by V_o = V_i / (1 - D), where D is the duty cycle.\n\nIf I rearrange that formula to solve for D, I get D = 1 - (V_i / V_o). Let's plug in the values: D = 1 - (110 / 150). Calculating that, 110 divided by 150 is 0.7333, and 1 minus that is 0.2667, which again is approximately 0.27.\n\nSo, using this formula, the duty cycle should be 0.27, which corresponds to option D. But let's see if there's another way to look at it to confirm.\n\nI recall that in a step-up chopper, during the ON time of the switch, the inductor stores energy, and during the OFF time, it releases that energy to boost the voltage. The ratio of ON time to total cycle time is the duty cycle D.\n\nGiven that, the average output voltage V_o is related to the input voltage V_i by the duty cycle as V_o = V_i / (1 - D). So, rearranging, D = 1 - (V_i / V_o).\n\nPlugging in V_o = 150 V and V_i = 110 V, D = 1 - (110 / 150) = 1 - 0.7333 = 0.2667, which is roughly 0.27.\n\nTherefore, the duty cycle is approximately 0.27, which is option D.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the units and dimensions. Duty cycle is a dimensionless quantity representing the fraction of the period the switch is ON. The input and output voltages are given in volts, and the formula correctly relates them through the duty cycle without any units conflict.\n\nAdditionally, I can think about the energy balance in the circuit. In a steady state, the energy stored in the inductor during the ON time should be released during the OFF time to maintain the output voltage at 150 V from a 110 V input.\n\nBut perhaps for a more thorough understanding, I should consider the inductor current and how it behaves in a step-up chopper. In continuous conduction mode (CCM), which is typically assumed unless specified otherwise, the inductor current never falls to zero, and there is a smooth transfer of energy.\n\nIn this mode, the average output voltage is indeed related to the input voltage by the duty cycle as V_o = V_i / (1 - D). Therefore, solving for D gives D = 1 - (V_i / V_o), which confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the formula is expressed as V_o = V_i / D for a buck converter, but in a step-up chopper, it's different.\n\nWait, no, for a buck converter, V_o = D * V_i, since the output is less than the input. For a boost converter, V_o = V_i / (1 - D), as I've used.\n\nJust to cross-verify, let's assume D = 0.27, and see if V_o = 110 / (1 - 0.27) = 110 / 0.73 \u2248 150 V, which matches the given output voltage.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the voltage across the inductor during the ON and OFF times, the voltage balance over a cycle should be zero for steady state.\n\nDuring the ON time (D * T), the inductor voltage is V_L = V_i - V_o, and during the OFF time ((1 - D) * T), V_L = -V_o.\n\nIntegrating over a cycle, the average voltage should be zero, leading to the same relationship.\n\nHence, I'm confident that the duty cycle is approximately 0.27.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.32\n\nB. 0.67\n\nC. 0.45\n\nD. 0.27\n\nThe correct answer is D. 0.27.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
