                    "text": "So I have this problem here about the free induction decay of a signal, and it says that the amplitude drops to 25% of its initial intensity after 1.0 second. It also mentions that we're assuming exponential relaxation and that \u03a9 = 0. I need to find the value of T2, which I believe is the spin-spin relaxation time in NMR spectroscopy.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the equation that describes the free induction decay (FID) in NMR. I know that the FID signal intensity decays exponentially over time due to spin-spin relaxation, which is characterized by the time constant T2. The general equation for the FID signal is:\n\n\\[ I(t) = I_0 e^{-t/T2} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( I(t) \\) is the intensity at time \\( t \\),\n\n- \\( I_0 \\) is the initial intensity at time \\( t = 0 \\),\n\n- \\( T2 \\) is the spin-spin relaxation time,\n\n- \\( e \\) is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nThe problem states that after 1.0 second, the amplitude drops to 25% of its initial intensity. So, at \\( t = 1.0 \\) s, \\( I(t) = 0.25 I_0 \\).\n\nPlugging these values into the equation gives:\n\n\\[ 0.25 I_0 = I_0 e^{-1.0 / T2} \\]\n\nI can divide both sides by \\( I_0 \\) (assuming \\( I_0 \\neq 0 \\)) to simplify:\n\n\\[ 0.25 = e^{-1.0 / T2} \\]\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\( T2 \\). I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to bring down the exponent:\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.25) = \\ln(e^{-1.0 / T2}) \\]\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.25) = -\\frac{1.0}{T2} \\]\n\nNow, I can solve for \\( T2 \\):\n\n\\[ T2 = -\\frac{1.0}{\\ln(0.25)} \\]\n\nI'll calculate the natural logarithm of 0.25:\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.25) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = -\\ln(4) \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ T2 = -\\frac{1.0}{-\\ln(4)} = \\frac{1.0}{\\ln(4)} \\]\n\nNow, \\( \\ln(4) \\) is approximately 1.386294361.\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ T2 = \\frac{1.0}{1.386294361} \\approx 0.721 \\] seconds.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 0.721 s\n\nB. 0.750 s\n\nC. 1.386 s\n\nD. 1.661 s\n\nSo, option A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait a minute, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[ I(t) = I_0 e^{-t/T2} \\]\n\nAt \\( t = 1.0 \\) s, \\( I(t) = 0.25 I_0 \\):\n\n\\[ 0.25 I_0 = I_0 e^{-1.0 / T2} \\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\( I_0 \\):\n\n\\[ 0.25 = e^{-1.0 / T2} \\]\n\nTake natural log:\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.25) = -\\frac{1.0}{T2} \\]\n\n\\[ T2 = -\\frac{1.0}{\\ln(0.25)} \\]\n\nSince \\( \\ln(0.25) = \\ln(1/4) = -\\ln(4) \\), then \\( -\\ln(0.25) = \\ln(4) \\), so:\n\n\\[ T2 = \\frac{1.0}{\\ln(4)} \\]\n\nNow, \\( \\ln(4) \\approx 1.386294361 \\), so:\n\n\\[ T2 \\approx \\frac{1.0}{1.386294361} \\approx 0.721 \\] seconds.\n\nYes, that checks out. Therefore, the correct answer is approximately 0.721 seconds, which corresponds to option A.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this calculation. The problem mentions \"free induction decay\" and \"exponential relaxation,\" and specifies that \u03a9 = 0. I'm not sure what \u03a9 represents in this context; perhaps it's the Larmor frequency or something similar. However, since it's set to zero, it likely doesn't affect the relaxation process being considered.\n\nAssuming that, and following the calculations above, I'm confident that the answer is indeed approximately 0.721 seconds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 0.721\\ \\text{s}} \\]"
