                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about Abraham Maslow's idea that some motives are more imperative to survival than others. The options are homeostatic regulation, goal-setting, expectancy-value, and hierarchy of needs. I need to pick the one that best expresses this concept.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what Maslow is talking about here. He's known for his hierarchy of needs, right? That pyramid where basic needs like food and shelter are at the bottom, and higher-level needs like esteem and self-actualization are at the top. So, according to Maslow, you have to meet the lower-level needs before you can focus on the higher-level ones.\n\nNow, the question is saying that some motives are more imperative to survival than others. That sounds a lot like the idea that certain needs take priority over others. So, if I had to guess, hierarchy of needs would be the correct answer because it directly refers to Maslow's theory.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should check what the other options are about.\n\nHomeostatic regulation \u2013 that sounds like it's about maintaining balance in the body, like temperature and stuff. It's probably related to physiological needs, which are important for survival, but it doesn't encompass all the needs that Maslow talked about. Maslow's hierarchy includes things like safety, love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization, which go beyond just physiological balance.\n\nGoal-setting seems different. It's more about setting objectives and working towards them. While goals can be related to needs, this doesn't specifically address the idea of some needs being more important than others.\n\nExpectancy-value theory is something I've heard of in motivation. It's about the expectation that effort will lead to performance, and that performance will lead to rewards. Again, this seems more related to motivation and less about the prioritization of different needs.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, hierarchy of needs seems to be the most fitting answer. It directly relates to Maslow's theory, which proposes that some needs are more fundamental and must be met before others.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should think about it differently. Is there any chance that another option could also express the idea that some motives are more imperative to survival than others?\n\nFor example, homeostatic regulation does play a role in maintaining life-sustaining conditions in the body, which is crucial for survival. But again, Maslow's hierarchy includes these physiological needs at the base, recognizing them as the most basic and urgent needs.\n\nGoal-setting might be important for achieving things that could contribute to meeting higher-level needs, like esteem or self-actualization, but it doesn't inherently prioritize survival needs.\n\nExpectancy-value theory is more about the thought processes behind motivation, rather than the hierarchy of different needs.\n\nTherefore, after considering all the options, I still believe that hierarchy of needs is the correct choice. It aligns perfectly with Maslow's idea that some motives are more imperative to survival than others, and that these needs are organized in a hierarchy where lower-level needs must be satisfied before higher-level ones can be addressed.\n\nTo wrap it up, the answer is D. Hierarchy of needs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
