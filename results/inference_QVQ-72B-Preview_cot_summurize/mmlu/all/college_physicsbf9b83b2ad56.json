                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an object that's thrown horizontally from a window, and it hits the ground after 2 seconds. The initial speed is 20 m/s, and we need to find the height from which it was thrown. Okay, let's recall what we know about projectile motion.\n\nFirst, in projectile motion, we can separate the motion into horizontal and vertical components. The horizontal motion is constant velocity, and the vertical motion is free fall under gravity.\n\nSince the object is thrown horizontally, the initial vertical velocity is zero. That means it's only the horizontal velocity that's 20 m/s, and the vertical motion is just due to gravity.\n\nWe need to find the height, which is essentially the vertical distance the object falls in 2 seconds.\n\nSo, for the vertical motion, we can use the equation:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( h \\) is the height,\n\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2 on Earth),\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\times (2.0 \\, \\text{s})^2 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( (2.0 \\, \\text{s})^2 \\):\n\n\\[ (2.0)^2 = 4.0 \\, \\text{s}^2 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\times 4.0 \\]\n\n\\[ h = 4.9 \\times 4.0 \\]\n\n\\[ h = 19.6 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let's double-check if there's any other factor we should consider.\n\nThe problem says to neglect air resistance and assume the ground is level, so we don't have to worry about those factors.\n\nAlso, the initial speed is horizontal, so it doesn't affect the vertical motion. So, the calculation seems correct.\n\nBut looking back at the options, 19.6 m is one of them, but maybe there's a trick here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the time it takes for the object to hit the ground based on the height.\n\nUsing another approach, the time of flight in free fall is given by:\n\n\\[ t = \\sqrt{\\frac{2h}{g}} \\]\n\nIf we rearrange this, we can solve for \\( h \\):\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\]\n\nWhich is what I used earlier.\n\nSo, plugging in the values again:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\times 4 = 19.6 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nHmm, consistent result.\n\nWait, but option C is 10.0 m, which is half of 19.6 m. Maybe I'm missing a factor of two somewhere.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider the equations of motion in more detail.\n\nStarting with the vertical component:\n\n\\[ v_y = v_{y0} + a_y t \\]\n\nGiven that \\( v_{y0} = 0 \\) (no initial vertical velocity), and \\( a_y = -g \\) (downward acceleration due to gravity), so:\n\n\\[ v_y = -g t \\]\n\nAnd the displacement in the vertical direction is:\n\n\\[ y = v_{y0} t + \\frac{1}{2} a_y t^2 \\]\n\nAgain, plugging in \\( v_{y0} = 0 \\) and \\( a_y = -g \\):\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2} (-g) t^2 \\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[ y = -\\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\]\n\nWhere the negative sign indicates downward direction. So, the height \\( h \\) is the magnitude of \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\]\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo, I think 19.6 m is the correct answer.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect this.\n\nSuppose the building isn't on level ground, but the problem says to assume the ground is level, so that's fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the horizontal distance, but since we're only asked for the height, that shouldn't be necessary.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the options provided.\n\nLet me check the calculation again.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\times (2.0)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ h = 0.5 \\times 9.8 \\times 4.0 \\]\n\n\\[ h = 4.9 \\times 4.0 \\]\n\n\\[ h = 19.6 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider significant figures, 9.8 has two decimal places, and 2.0 has two significant figures. So, the result should have two decimal places, which 19.6 fits.\n\nBut looking back at the options, they have varying precisions. Maybe the answer is expected to be rounded differently.\n\nWait, option D is 19.6 m, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut perhaps in exam conditions, they might expect a different answer due to rounding or unit considerations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the answer in terms of meters, and there's a conversion needed, but the problem specifies meters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding of what \"height\" means in this context, but it's straightforward: it's the vertical distance from the window to the ground.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is D. 19.6 m.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
