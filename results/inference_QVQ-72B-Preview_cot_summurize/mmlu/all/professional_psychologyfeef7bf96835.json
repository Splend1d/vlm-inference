                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these statements best describes a researcher's obligations regarding the use of animals in psychological research. I know that ethics in research involving animals is a big deal, and there are strict guidelines to make sure animals are treated humanely. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that animals should never be used in research when alternative procedures are available. That sounds like a reasonable starting point. It means that if there's a way to do the research without using animals, researchers should prefer that method. But is this the best way to describe a researcher's obligations? Well, it's important, but maybe there's more to it.\n\nOption B states that animals should never be used in research if a research procedure will cause them pain or stress. This seems really strict. Pain and stress can be part of some research procedures, and completely avoiding them might not always be possible, especially in certain types of studies. But maybe the idea is to minimize pain and stress as much as possible. I think there's more to it than just never using animals if the procedure causes pain or stress.\n\nOption C says that inflicting pain or stress on animals is acceptable in research only when an alternative (nonpainful) procedure is unavailable and the use of the procedure is justified by the potential value of the study. This seems more balanced. It acknowledges that sometimes, causing pain or stress might be necessary if there are no other options and if the potential benefits of the study are significant enough to justify it. This aligns with the idea of weighing the costs and benefits, ensuring that animal suffering is minimized, and that alternatives are considered first.\n\nOption D suggests that inflicting pain or stress on animals is acceptable in research as long as it is minimized and the animal's life is terminated as soon as is feasible. This option seems problematic. While minimizing pain and stress is important, the idea of terminating the animal's life as soon as feasible doesn't sit right. It implies that the animal's life is disposable once it's no longer needed for the study, which isn't ethical. Animals should be treated with respect and their well-being should be considered throughout the entire research process, not just until the study is over.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, I think Option C is the best description of a researcher's obligations regarding the use of animals in psychological research. It emphasizes considering alternatives, justifying the use of procedures that may cause pain or stress based on the potential value of the study, and implies that pain and stress should be minimized as much as possible.\n\nBut just to make sure, I should think about some key principles in animal research ethics. One of the fundamental principles is the \"3Rs\": Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement. Replacement means using alternative methods that don't involve animals. Reduction means using the fewest number of animals necessary to achieve the study's objectives. Refinement means minimizing pain and distress and maximizing animal welfare. Option C aligns with these principles by suggesting that alternatives should be considered first (replacement), and that causing pain or stress is only acceptable if necessary and justified by the study's potential value.\n\nOption A is similar to the replacement principle but doesn't fully capture the 3Rs. Option B is too restrictive because it might not account for situations where causing some pain or stress is necessary and cannot be avoided, and where the benefits outweigh the costs. Option D contradicts the refinement principle by suggesting terminating the animal's life as soon as feasible, which doesn't necessarily ensure the animal's well-being.\n\nTherefore, I believe Option C is the most accurate and ethical description of a researcher's obligations regarding the use of animals in psychological research.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
