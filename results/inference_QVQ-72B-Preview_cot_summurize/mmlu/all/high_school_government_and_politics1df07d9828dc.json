                    "text": "So I've got this question here about voters in federal, state, and local elections. It's asking which of the following statements is the least true. Let me see what the options are.\n\nOption A says that voter turnout is lower in midterm elections than in presidential elections. I think that's generally true. I remember hearing that a lot more people turn out to vote in presidential years compared to the midterms when there's no presidential race.\n\nOption B says that voters who don't have a party affiliation tend to vote less regularly than those who strongly identify with a party. That also seems to make sense. People who are strongly tied to a party might be more motivated to vote because they feel a stronger connection to the candidates from their party.\n\nOption C says that young adults are less likely to vote than senior citizens. I've heard this one a lot too. Young people are often less likely to vote, maybe because they're busier with school or starting careers, or maybe they don't feel as connected to the political process.\n\nOption D says that individuals are more likely to vote when they believe they know which candidate will win an election. Hmm, this one seems a bit different from the others. I thought that people might be less likely to vote if they think the outcome is already decided, especially if they think their vote won't make a difference. But maybe sometimes people want to be part of a winning team, so they turn out to vote for the expected winner.\n\nWait a minute, I'm a bit confused about option D. On one hand, if people think the outcome is certain, they might stay home because they feel their vote isn't needed. But maybe some people want to ensure that the winner wins by a large margin or something like that. I need to think about this more carefully.\n\nLet me consider each option again.\n\nOption A: Lower turnout in midterm elections \u2013 that's well-documented. The presidential race draws more attention and higher turnout.\n\nOption B: Voters without party affiliation vote less regularly \u2013 that also seems logical. Party affiliation can be a strong motivator to vote.\n\nOption C: Young adults vote less than seniors \u2013 again, this is a common observation. Younger people have lower turnout rates.\n\nOption D: People are more likely to vote if they think they know who will win \u2013 this one is tricky. I can see arguments on both sides. Maybe in some cases, people are more likely to vote if they think their side will win, but in other cases, people might not bother if they think the outcome is already decided.\n\nI need to think about this more. Maybe I should look up some research on this topic.\n\nAlright, after a quick search, I found that there's a concept called \"bandwagon effect\" where people might be more likely to support a candidate they think is going to win. But there's also \"underdog support,\" where people might rally behind a candidate who is trailing.\n\nMoreover, in some elections, if a race is seen as a foregone conclusion, voter turnout might decrease because voters feel their participation isn't necessary. Conversely, in close races, turnout might be higher because every vote counts.\n\nSo, it seems like the relationship between perceived certainty of the outcome and voter turnout isn't straightforward. It might depend on various factors, such as the specific context of the election, the strength of partisanship among voters, and even the personality of the candidates.\n\nGiven that, option D seems to be the least accurate statement among the options provided. While it's possible that some individuals might be more likely to vote if they think they know who will win, it's not a universal truth and can vary widely based on individual perceptions and the electoral context.\n\nTherefore, I would say that option D is the least true statement about voters in federal, state, and local elections.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
