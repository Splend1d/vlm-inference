Price signals that guide producers on what, when, how, and for whom to produce goods and services.\n\nB. Active government ownership and direction of production.\n\nC. Voluntary market exchange between buyers and sellers.\n\nD. Distribution of income and goods on the basis of contribution or productivity.\n\nAnd the question is asking which one of these does NOT describe how resources are allocated in a competitive market system.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. A competitive market system is typically characterized by private ownership of resources and minimal government intervention. So, in such a system, the allocation of resources is largely determined by the interactions of buyers and sellers in the market.\n\nOption A talks about price signals guiding producers on what to produce, when to produce it, how to produce it, and for whom. This sounds very much like the concept of supply and demand in a market economy. When prices go up, producers are incentivized to produce more, and vice versa. So, this is definitely a way resources are allocated in a competitive market system.\n\nOption B mentions active government ownership and direction of production. Now, in a competitive market system, the idea is that the government should have minimal involvement in the economy. Government ownership of production would suggest a more planned economy, like in socialism or communism, where the government makes decisions about what to produce and how much. That doesn't align with a competitive market system, which relies on market forces rather than government planning.\n\nOption C refers to voluntary market exchange between buyers and sellers. This is a fundamental aspect of a market economy. People enter into transactions willingly, based on their own self-interest, and through these exchanges, resources are allocated. So, this is definitely part of how resources are allocated in a competitive market system.\n\nOption D talks about distributing income and goods based on contribution or productivity. In a market economy, the factor payments, like wages for labor and rent for land, are determined by the productivity of those factors. So, in theory, resources are allocated to where they are most productive, and incomes are distributed based on the contribution of each factor. This seems consistent with a competitive market system.\n\nGiven these considerations, it appears that option B, active government ownership and direction of production, does not describe how resources are allocated in a competitive market system. Instead, in such a system, resource allocation is primarily determined by market forces, not by government directives.\n\nSo, the answer should be B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
