                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to find the smallest prime number whose digits sum up to 19. The options given are 5, 11, 17, and 199. Hmm, but I think there might be a mistake here because all of these are primes, but we need to find the smallest one where the digits add up to 19.\n\nFirst off, let's understand what a prime number is. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. So, primes like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and so on.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the smallest prime whose digits sum to 19. Looking at the options:\n\nA. 5\n\nWell, 5 is a prime, but 5 is less than 19, so its digits don't sum to 19. Maybe it's a typo?\n\nB. 11\n\n1 + 1 = 2, which is less than 19.\n\nC. 17\n\n1 + 7 = 8, still less than 19.\n\nD. 199\n\n1 + 9 + 9 = 19. Okay, this fits the condition, and 199 is a prime number.\n\nBut wait, is 199 the smallest prime whose digits sum to 19? Maybe there are smaller primes with digits summing to 19.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this systematically. I need to find the smallest prime where the sum of its digits is 19.\n\nFirst, consider the number of digits. Since 19 is a relatively small sum, the number can't have too many digits. Let's see:\n\n- For a 1-digit number: The maximum sum is 9 (for 9), which is less than 19.\n\n- For a 2-digit number: The maximum sum is 18 (for 99), which is still less than 19.\n\n- For a 3-digit number: The maximum sum is 27 (for 999), which is more than 19.\n\nSo, the smallest possible number of digits for such a prime is 3 digits.\n\nNow, I need to find the smallest 3-digit prime where the digits add up to 19.\n\nLet's denote the 3-digit number as abc, where a, b, c are its digits, and a \u2260 0.\n\nSo, a + b + c = 19, and abc is a prime number.\n\nSince a, b, c are digits, a can be from 1 to 9, and b and c from 0 to 9.\n\nTo make abc as small as possible, we should make a as small as possible, then b, and finally c as large as possible.\n\nStarting with a=1:\n\nThen b + c = 18.\n\nSince b and c are digits (b from 0 to 9, c from 0 to 9), the smallest number would have b=9 and c=9.\n\nSo, 199.\n\nIs 199 a prime? Yes, it is.\n\nIs there a smaller 3-digit prime with digits summing to 19?\n\nLet's check if there's a number smaller than 199 with the same digit sum.\n\nWait, if a=1, and b + c =18, and we want the smallest number, so b=9 and c=9, which is 199.\n\nIf a=2, then b + c =17.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- b=8, c=9 \u2192 289\n\nBut 289 is 17 squared, which is not prime.\n\n- b=9, c=8 \u2192 298\n\n298 is even, so divisible by 2, not prime.\n\nNext, a=3, b + c=16.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- b=7, c=9 \u2192 379\n\nIs 379 prime? Let's check divisibility rules:\n\n- It's not even.\n\n- Sum of digits is 19, not divisible by 3.\n\n- Last digit is not 0 or 5, so not divisible by 5.\n\n- For 7 and 11, might need to check, but for now, assume it's prime.\n\nWait, but 379 is less than 400, and 19*19=361, 20*20=400, so it's between 19 and 20, but since 19*19=361 and 20*20=400, and 379 is between them, it's not a perfect square, so likely prime.\n\nBut to be sure, check if it has any divisors.\n\nCheck divisibility by primes less than sqrt(379):\n\n- 2: no.\n\n- 3: sum of digits is 19, not divisible by 3.\n\n- 5: ends with 9, no.\n\n- 7: 379 \u00f7 7 \u2248 54.14, not integer.\n\n- 11: alternating sum is 3 - 7 + 9 = 5, not divisible by 11.\n\n- 13: 379 \u00f7 13 \u2248 29.15, not integer.\n\n- 17: 379 \u00f7 17 \u2248 22.29, not integer.\n\nSo, 379 is prime.\n\nTherefore, 379 is smaller than 199 and its digits sum to 19.\n\nWait, but 379 is smaller than 199? Wait, no, 199 is smaller than 379.\n\nWait, 199 is 100 + 90 + 9 = 199.\n\n379 is 300 + 70 + 9 = 379.\n\nSo, 199 is smaller than 379.\n\nBut is there a smaller prime than 199 with digits summing to 19?\n\nLet's check a=1, b=9, c=9 \u2192 199, which is prime.\n\nIf a=1, b=8, c=9 \u2192 189\n\nIs 189 prime? 189 is 9*21, not prime.\n\na=1, b=7, c=9 \u2192 179\n\nIs 179 prime? Yes, it's a prime number.\n\nWait, 179 is smaller than 199.\n\nSo, 179 is 1 + 7 + 9 = 17, which is less than 19.\n\nWait, no, 1 + 7 + 9 = 17, not 19.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, 1 + 7 + 9 = 17, which is less than 19.\n\nSo, 179 doesn't satisfy the digit sum condition.\n\nWait, perhaps a=1, b=9, c=9 is the smallest.\n\nWait, but a=1, b=9, c=9 is 199.\n\nIs there a smaller number with a=1 and b + c=18?\n\nYes, b=8, c=9 \u2192 189, which is not prime.\n\nb=9, c=8 \u2192 198, which is even, not prime.\n\nSo, 199 is the smallest with a=1.\n\nWhat if a=2?\n\na=2, b + c=17.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- b=8, c=9 \u2192 289\n\nBut 289 is 17 squared, which is 289, and 17 is prime, but 289 is not prime.\n\n- b=9, c=8 \u2192 298\n\n298 is even, not prime.\n\nSo, no primes here.\n\na=3, b + c=16.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- b=7, c=9 \u2192 379, which is prime.\n\n- b=8, c=8 \u2192 388, even, not prime.\n\n- b=9, c=7 \u2192 397, which is prime.\n\nBut 379 is smaller than 397.\n\nSo, 379 is another candidate, but it's larger than 199.\n\nWait, but 199 is smaller, and it's prime with digits summing to 19.\n\nIs there a smaller prime than 199 with digits summing to 19?\n\nWait, 199 is 100 + 90 + 9 = 199.\n\nIs there a 3-digit number smaller than 199 with digits summing to 19?\n\nLet's try a=1, b=9, c=9 \u2192 199.\n\nIs there a smaller number with a=1 and b + c=18?\n\nAs before, b=8, c=9 \u2192 189, which is not prime.\n\nb=9, c=8 \u2192 198, even, not prime.\n\nSo, no.\n\nTherefore, 199 is the smallest 3-digit prime with digits summing to 19.\n\nIs there a possibility of a 2-digit prime with digits summing to 19?\n\nWell, as earlier, the maximum digit sum for a 2-digit number is 18 (for 99), which is less than 19.\n\nSo, no.\n\nSimilarly, for 1-digit numbers, the maximum digit is 9, which is less than 19.\n\nTherefore, the smallest prime whose digits sum to 19 is 199.\n\nBut wait, the options provided are 5, 11, 17, and 199.\n\nSo, among these, 199 is the correct answer.\n\nBut perhaps there is a smaller prime that I'm missing.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider more digits.\n\nWait, but earlier reasoning shows that for 3-digit numbers, 199 is the smallest prime with digits summing to 19.\n\nIs there a 4-digit number smaller than 199 with digits summing to 19?\n\nWell, 199 is 100 + 90 + 9 = 199.\n\nIf I consider a 4-digit number, it would be at least 1000, which is larger than 199.\n\nSo, no, 199 is the smallest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the options provided.\n\nBut based on the reasoning, 199 is the smallest prime whose digits sum to 19.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 199.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{199} \\]"
