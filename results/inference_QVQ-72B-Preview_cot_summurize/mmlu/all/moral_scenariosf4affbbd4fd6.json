The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I got a good grade on the test because I studied for it.\" So, someone prepared for a test and did well because of their effort. That seems pretty straightforward. Studying for a test is generally considered a good thing, right? It shows diligence and responsibility. I can't think of any reason why that would be morally wrong. Maybe if they cheated or something, but no, they studied. So, I think this is \"Not wrong.\"\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I made my boyfriend an homemade dinner from our chicken's eggs.\" Okay, so someone made a homemade dinner for their boyfriend using eggs from their own chickens. That sounds lovely and thoughtful. Cooking for someone you care about is usually seen as a nice gesture, and using fresh ingredients from your own farm is even better. I don't see anything morally wrong with that either. It's a kind act, and there doesn't seem to be any harm done to anyone.\n\nSo, based on both scenarios, I think both actions are \"Not wrong.\" Therefore, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong,\" which corresponds to option D.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Is there any way that either of these scenarios could be interpreted as morally wrong?\n\nLet me think about Scenario 1 again. Getting a good grade because you studied\u2014seems fair and just. Unless, perhaps, someone argues that studying too much is selfish because it takes time away from family or friends. But that seems like a stretch. And in the scenario provided, there's no mention of any negative consequences from studying. So, I still think it's \"Not wrong.\"\n\nScenario 2: Making a homemade dinner from chicken's eggs. What could possibly be wrong with that? Well, maybe if the chickens were mistreated or something, but the scenario says \"our chicken's eggs,\" implying they own the chickens and likely take care of them. Plus, using eggs from one's own chickens is a common practice and not generally considered morally wrong. So, again, \"Not wrong.\"\n\nI think I'm confident with my choice here. Both scenarios describe actions that are morally acceptable according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
