Okay, first things first, I need to recall who played a Vulcan in that specific Star Trek movie.\n\nI know that Star Trek has a lot of characters, and Vulcans are famous for their pointy ears and logical minds. The original Vulcan character is Spock, played by Leonard Nimoy, but he's not an actress, so that doesn't help here. So, it must be a female Vulcan character in 'The Wrath of Khan.'\n\nLet me think about 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.' I remember that it's a sequel to the first Star Trek movie and involves Khan Noonien Singh, who is a main antagonist. But who plays the female Vulcan?\n\nI don't recall any female Vulcan characters in that movie off the top of my head, so maybe I need to look into the cast. Let's see, the main cast of the original series included Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu, and Chekov. Most of them returned in the movies.\n\nWait, in 'The Wrath of Khan,' Saavik was a character, who was a Vulcan trainee or something like that. Maybe that's the role in question.\n\nLet me check the options again: Whoopi Goldberg, Jennifer Grey, Kirstie Alley, Helen Hunt.\n\nHmm, I think Whoopi Goldberg was in Star Trek, but I believe she was in 'Star Trek: The Next Generation,' not the movies. Yeah, she played Guinan in TNG, which was after 'The Wrath of Khan.'\n\nJennifer Grey, I know from 'Dirty Dancing' and some other movies, but I don't recall her being in Star Trek.\n\nKirstie Alley, now that rings a bell. I think she was in some Star Trek movies. Let me think\u2014she was in 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan' and 'Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,' playing Saavik.\n\nYes, that sounds familiar. Saavik was a Vulcan character, and Kirstie Alley played her in those two movies.\n\nHelen Hunt, I know from 'Mad About You' and 'As Good as It Gets,' but I don't think she was in Star Trek.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer should be Kirstie Alley.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check. Saavik was indeed a Vulcan character in 'The Wrath of Khan,' and Kirstie Alley played her. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. Kirstie Alley.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
