                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about another person's behavior. It says, \"Another person's behavior is referred to as the...\" and then there are four options: A. self-serving bias, B. actor-observer effect, C. fundamental attribution bias, D. self-perception bias.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means and which one fits the description of referring to another person's behavior.\n\nLet me start with option A: self-serving bias. I remember learning about this in psychology class. It's when people tend to take credit for their successes but blame external factors for their failures. So, it's more about how individuals perceive their own actions and outcomes, not really about another person's behavior. Hmm, that seems like it's focused on the self rather than others. Maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nNext, option B: actor-observer effect. This sounds interesting. I think it has to do with how we explain behaviors differently depending on whether we're the ones doing the action or observing someone else doing it. Let me think about this. When we're the actor, we might attribute our behavior to situational factors, but when we observe someone else's behavior, we might attribute it more to their personality or dispositional traits. So, in that case, referring to another person's behavior would involve observing and making attributions about them, not ourselves. This seems relevant, but I need to make sure.\n\nOption C: fundamental attribution bias. I've heard of this one too. It's the tendency to overattribute other people's behavior to their\u5185\u5728 traits or dispositions while underemphasizing the role of situational factors. So, for example, if someone cuts you off in traffic, you might think they're rude (dispositional attribution) rather than considering that they might be in a hurry because of an emergency (situational attribution). This seems to focus on how we perceive and explain the behavior of others based on their characteristics.\n\nLastly, option D: self-perception bias. I'm not as familiar with this term, but it sounds like it relates to how we perceive ourselves, perhaps based on our own behavior. Maybe it's similar to self-serving bias, where we interpret our own actions to maintain a positive self-image. Again, this seems to be more about the self than about perceiving others.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Self-serving bias: how we explain our own successes and failures.\n\n- Actor-observer effect: differences in how we explain our own behavior versus others'.\n\n- Fundamental attribution bias: tending to overattribute others' behavior to their dispositional traits.\n\n- Self-perception bias: how we interpret our own behavior to understand ourselves.\n\nGiven that the question is about \"another person's behavior,\" it's likely referring to how we perceive and explain the actions of others. Between options B and C, both relate to perceiving others, but the fundamental attribution bias specifically deals with the tendency to overemphasize dispositional factors in others' behavior, which seems particularly relevant.\n\nThe actor-observer effect is more about the difference in attribution styles between ourselves and others, whereas the fundamental attribution bias is specifically about the bias we show in attributing others' behavior to their\u5185\u5728 traits.\n\nTherefore, I think the most accurate answer is option C: fundamental attribution bias.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider an example. Suppose someone sees a colleague pass by without saying hello. The fundamental attribution bias would lead the observer to think, \"My colleague is rude,\" (dispositional attribution) rather than considering that the colleague might be in a hurry or having a bad day (situational attribution).\n\nIn this scenario, the observer is focusing on the other person's disposition rather than the situation, which aligns with the fundamental attribution bias.\n\nOn the other hand, the actor-observer effect would involve a difference in attribution depending on whether you're the actor or the observer. So, if you're the one passing by without greeting, you might attribute it to being in a hurry, but if you see someone else do it, you might attribute it to their personality.\n\nWhile both concepts relate to attributing others' behavior, the fundamental attribution bias is more specifically about the tendency to overattribute to dispositional factors.\n\nI think I'm confident with my choice of option C: fundamental attribution bias.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
