The options are:\n\nA. eternally and unchangeably good.\n\nB. good when taken together, but not good separately.\n\nC. good, even taken separately.\n\nD. none of the above.\n\nHmm, Augustine was a pretty important philosopher and theologian, especially known for his thoughts on God and creation. I remember that he believed everything created by God is good, but I need to be precise here.\n\nFirst, let's recall that Augustine thought that God is the creator of all things, and since God is good, everything He creates is good. So, created things are good in themselves. But there's more to it.\n\nOption A says \"eternally and unchangeably good.\" Hmm, is that accurate? I know that God is eternal and unchanging, but created things, especially material things, are not eternal; they come into existence and can change or perish. So, maybe not.\n\nOption B says \"good when taken together, but not good separately.\" That sounds a bit odd. If each thing is good when part of the whole but bad on its own, that doesn't align with Augustine's view. He believed that each created thing has its own goodness, even if it's part of a larger whole.\n\nOption C says \"good, even taken separately.\" This seems more in line with Augustine's thought. He would argue that each created thing has its own nature and is good according to its nature. So, separately, they are good.\n\nOption D is \"none of the above,\" which doesn't seem right based on what I know.\n\nLet me think deeper. Augustine's view is that God created everything, and everything He created is good. This is based on the Genesis account where after each act of creation, it says that it was good. So, each thing is good in its own right.\n\nMoreover, Augustine believed in the concept of hierarchy in creation, where some things are higher or lower in the order of being, but even the lowest things have their own goodness.\n\nSo, if I had to choose between A, B, C, and D, I think C is the closest. But just to be thorough, let's consider if created things are \"eternally and unchangeably good.\"\n\nEternally good would imply that created things last forever, which isn't the case for perishable things like plants and animals. Only God is eternal. Similarly, unchangeably good suggests that their goodness can't change, but again, created things can be subject to change, corruption, or improvement.\n\nTherefore, option A seems incorrect because created things aren't eternal or unchangeable.\n\nOption B suggests that things are only good when taken together, not separately. That doesn't align with Augustine's view, as he believed in the intrinsic goodness of each created thing.\n\nOption C says they are good, even taken separately, which makes sense. Each thing has its own goodness, whether it's part of a larger whole or not.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Created things are good, even taken separately.\n\nJust to double-check, I recall a quote from Augustine where he says something along the lines of \"every created thing is good, and nothing is evil in itself.\" That aligns with option C.\n\nAlso, considering that Augustine believed in the fall of man and the presence of evil in the world, but he saw evil not as a substance or a created thing, but as a privation or absence of good. So, even in the presence of evil, the created things themselves are still good, just misused or corrupted.\n\nTherefore, Augustine would say that created things are good, even when considered separately, but their goodness can be obscured or perverted by sin and evil.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. Good, even taken separately.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
