                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem: an inflated balloon with a heavy rock tied to it is dropped into a deep lake. As the balloon sinks deeper and deeper, the buoyant force acting on it... and I have to choose whether it increases, decreases, remains largely unchanged, or if I need more information. Okay, so first things first, I need to understand what's happening here.\n\nSo, there's a balloon filled with some gas, and it has a heavy rock tied to it. They're both dropped into a deep lake. Now, the balloon is going to be submerged in water, and we know that objects in water experience buoyancy, which is an upward force due to the pressure differences in the fluid. The buoyant force is given by Archimedes' principle, which says that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.\n\nSo, buoyant force (F_b) = weight of fluid displaced.\n\nNow, the balloon is inflatable, so it probably has some volume, and when it's submerged, it displaces a certain amount of water. But wait, it's inflated, so it has air inside. But it's being submerged in water, which is much denser than air. So, maybe the pressure inside the balloon is higher than outside, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nWait, actually, when you submerge something in water, the pressure increases with depth, right? So, the deeper it goes, the greater the pressure outside the balloon. That might affect the volume of the balloon. If the balloon is compressible, like a rubber balloon filled with air, the increased external pressure might make it smaller, which would mean it displaces less water. If it displaces less water, then the buoyant force would decrease.\n\nBut, on the other hand, if the balloon is made of a material that doesn't compress much, or if it's filled with something that doesn't compress, then maybe the volume stays the same, and the buoyant force remains largely unchanged.\n\nBut, considering it's an inflated balloon, probably filled with air, and air is compressible, especially under increased pressure. So, as it goes deeper, the pressure increases, and the air inside the balloon would be compressed, making the balloon smaller. Therefore, it would displace less water, and the buoyant force would decrease.\n\nWait, but the rock is tied to it. The rock is solid and probably doesn't change volume much with pressure. So, the rock's buoyant force should remain pretty much the same regardless of depth, since water is almost incompressible, and the rock itself isn't compressible.\n\nSo, overall, the total buoyant force would be the sum of the buoyant forces on the balloon and the rock. The rock's buoyant force stays the same, but the balloon's buoyant force decreases with depth because its volume decreases due to compression.\n\nTherefore, the total buoyant force acting on the system (balloon + rock) would decrease as the balloon sinks deeper.\n\nBut, let's think about this again. The problem says \"the buoyant force acting on it.\" It doesn't specify whether \"it\" refers to the balloon or the entire system of balloon and rock. Hmm.\n\nIf \"it\" refers to the entire system, then yes, the buoyant force on the entire system would decrease because the balloon's contribution decreases as it compresses.\n\nAlternatively, if \"it\" refers only to the balloon, then the buoyant force on the balloon alone would decrease for the same reason.\n\nBut the rock also has a buoyant force acting on it, so if we consider the entire system, the total buoyant force would still decrease due to the balloon's compression.\n\nSo, in either case, the buoyant force acting on \"it,\" whether it's the balloon or the system, decreases with depth.\n\nWait, but the rock's buoyant force stays the same, and the balloon's decreases, so overall, the total buoyant force decreases.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. decreases.\n\nBut let's make sure. Is there any other factor that could affect the buoyant force?\n\nWell, the density of water might change with depth due to temperature variations or salinity, but in a deep lake, I think water is pretty uniform in density, especially in freshwater lakes.\n\nAlso, the pressure might affect the balloon's volume, as I thought, but what if the balloon is filled with a gas that's not compressible, like some kind of dense gas that doesn't compress much under pressure?\n\nWell, most gases are compressible, especially at greater depths where the pressure is significantly higher. So, even if it's filled with something like helium or air, it would still compress.\n\nAlternatively, if the balloon is filled with something incompressible, like water or some liquid, then its volume wouldn't change, and the buoyant force would remain constant.\n\nBut the problem says it's an inflated balloon, which typically implies it's filled with a gas, not a liquid.\n\nSo, assuming it's filled with a gas, the buoyant force should decrease with depth due to compression of the gas inside the balloon.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. decreases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
