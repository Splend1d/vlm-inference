I think I've seen Pepto-Bismol before, but I'm not entirely sure about its color.\n\nFirst off, Pepto-Bismol is a medication, right? It's commonly used for upset stomachs, heartburn, indigestion, and things like that. I believe it comes in both liquid and tablet forms. The liquid version is what we're interested in here.\n\nLet me think back to the last time I saw a bottle of Pepto-Bismol. I think it's usually in a white bottle with a red cap, but that might be the tablets. For the liquid, I seem to recall it's in a different container. Maybe a pink bottle or something? Wait, no, I think the liquid is in a bottle that's transparent or light-colored.\n\nOkay, maybe thinking about the bottle color isn't the best approach. Maybe I should focus on the liquid itself. I remember that Pepto-Bismol liquid has a distinct color. Let me see if I can recall.\n\nI think the liquid is not clear because clear seems too plain, and it's definitely not blue or green. Blue is more associated with other types of medications, like cough syrups sometimes, but not Pepto-Bismol. Green also doesn't ring a bell; that seems more like the color of some herbal remedies or something.\n\nSo, eliminating blue and green leaves me with pink and clear. But I have a feeling that it's not clear. I think it has a distinct color, probably pink. I seem to recall that Pepto-Bismol liquid is pinkish in color. Is that right?\n\nLet me try to visualize it. If I close my eyes and think about Pepto-Bismol liquid, I see a pinkish hue. It's not a bright red or anything, more of a pale pink. Yeah, that sounds familiar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's more of a salmon color? Wait, salmon is like a pinkish-orange, and I don't think that's the case here. No, I think it's more of a light pink.\n\nAnother thing I recall is that Pepto-Bismol liquid is often advertised and depicted in commercials as being pink. I think that matches my memory.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should consider if there are different varieties or flavors that might have different colors. For example, sometimes medications can come in different flavors, and the color might reflect that. However, I don't recall Pepto-Bismol having multiple colored liquids based on flavor. I think it's generally one color.\n\nSo, based on my recollection and eliminating the unlikely options, I'm leaning towards A. pink as the color of Pepto-Bismol liquid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ pink}} \\]"
