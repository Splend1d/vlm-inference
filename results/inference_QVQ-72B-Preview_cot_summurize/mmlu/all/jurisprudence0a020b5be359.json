                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which one of the following schools supports the view that a custom becomes law when it receives the stamp of judicial recognition by courts?\"\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Analytical School\n\nB. Natural Law School\n\nC. Historical School\n\nD. Sociological School\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which legal school of thought believes that a custom turns into law once it's recognized by the courts.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these schools stands for.\n\nStarting with the Analytical School, I recall that this school emphasizes the positivist approach, focusing on the actual laws and regulations as they are written, without considering moral or ethical aspects. They believe in the sovereignty of the law and that what the state says is law, is law. So, in terms of customs becoming law, if the Analytical School is all about state-enacted laws, maybe customs need to be recognized by the state somehow.\n\nNext, the Natural Law School. This one is about universal principles of right and wrong that transcend human laws. They believe that laws should be based on moral and ethical standards. So, for them, a custom might become law if it aligns with natural justice or moral principles. But the question is specifically about judicial recognition, which seems more procedural than based on morality.\n\nThe Historical School thinks that laws evolve over time based on historical and cultural contexts. They emphasize the importance of tradition and customs in shaping the law. So, perhaps for them, customs already have a place in law, and judicial recognition might be a formal acknowledgment of that.\n\nThen there's the Sociological School, which views law as a social institution that serves the needs of society. They consider the impact of laws on society and how society influences the development of law. Maybe customs become law when they are recognized by the courts as reflecting societal norms.\n\nOkay, so now I need to match the statement that a custom becomes law upon judicial recognition to one of these schools.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If a custom receives judicial recognition, that means judges in courts have acknowledged it as having legal\u6548\u529b. So, it's being given the stamp of approval by the legal system.\n\nIn the Analytical School, since it's all about positive law and the commands of the sovereign, maybe customs need to be recognized by the courts (which are part of the sovereign system) to be considered law.\n\nBut wait, the Historical School also values customs a lot, as they see history and tradition as foundational to law. Maybe they believe that customs are already law, whether recognized by courts or not.\n\nThe Sociological School might argue that customs reflect social practices and norms, and judicial recognition is just formalizing what is already accepted in society.\n\nThe Natural Law School would probably say that customs must align with natural law principles to be considered law, and judicial recognition might be one way to confirm that alignment.\n\nHmm, but the question specifies \"judicial recognition by courts,\" which seems very procedural and tied to the formal legal system.\n\nI think the Analytical School is the most likely candidate here because they emphasize the role of the state and its institutions in defining what is law. So, if a custom is recognized by the courts, which are part of the state apparatus, then it would fit with their view that law is whatever the sovereign says it is.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I should look up some specific theories or quotes from these schools to confirm.\n\nFirst, the Analytical School, also known as the positivist school, was led by jurists like John Austin and H.L.A. Hart. They believed in the separation of law and morality, and that the validity of law depends on its sources, not its content.\n\nSo, if a custom is recognized by the courts as having legal force, that would fit into their view of law as something created and recognized by the legal system, regardless of moral considerations.\n\nThe Natural Law School, on the other hand, would likely have a different perspective, as they believe in inherent moral principles that transcend positive law. For them, a custom might be considered law if it aligns with natural law, but judicial recognition alone might not be sufficient if the custom contradicts moral principles.\n\nThe Historical School, associated with figures like Friedrich Karl von Savigny, emphasized that law should develop organically from the customs and traditions of a people. So, for them, customs are already a source of law, and judicial recognition might be seen as a formal acknowledgment of what is already law, but perhaps not the only way for customs to become law.\n\nThe Sociological School, influenced by sociologists like Max Weber and jurists like Roscoe Pound, views law as a means to achieve social order and justice. They might see judicial recognition of customs as a way to incorporate societal norms into the formal legal system, but again, it might not be the only path.\n\nGiven this, I still think the Analytical School is the most fitting answer because of their emphasis on the formal sources of law and the role of the state and its institutions, particularly the courts, in defining what constitutes law.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider if there's any specific doctrine within these schools that directly supports the idea that judicial recognition turns a custom into law.\n\nIn the Analytical School, H.L.A. Hart's concept of the rule of recognition might be relevant here. The rule of recognition is a meta-rule that specifies the criteria for identifying valid legal rules in a particular legal system. If a custom is recognized by the courts through judicial decisions, it could be seen as being incorporated into the legal system via the rule of recognition.\n\nMoreover, in Austin's theory, laws are commands issued by the sovereign, and the courts are part of the sovereign's duty to apply and enforce these commands. So, if a custom is recognized and enforced by the courts, it would be considered a law under this framework.\n\nIn contrast, the Natural Law School would likely require more than just judicial recognition; they would demand that the custom aligns with moral and ethical principles to be considered law.\n\nThe Historical School would probably agree that customs are a source of law, but their emphasis is more on the organic development of law from the people's customs and less on formal recognition by the courts.\n\nThe Sociological School might view judicial recognition as one way to integrate social customs into law, but their focus is broader, considering the social functions and impacts of law.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, it seems that the Analytical School is the one that supports the view that a custom becomes law when it receives the stamp of judicial recognition by courts.\n\nWait a minute, but I'm a bit unsure. I recall that in some legal systems, like English law, customs can be recognized as common law through judicial decisions. This seems to align with the Analytical School's view of law as what the courts say it is.\n\nAdditionally, in Hart's theory, the rule of recognition is determined by the practices of the officials in the legal system, including the courts. So, if the courts consistently recognize and apply a custom, it becomes part of the law according to the rule of recognition.\n\nOn the other hand, the Natural Law School would argue that even if a custom is recognized by the courts, it's only law if it conforms to higher moral principles. So, judicial recognition alone isn't sufficient for them.\n\nThe Historical School would likely consider customs as already part of the law, regardless of whether they're recognized by the courts or not, as long as they are deeply rooted in the society's traditions.\n\nThe Sociological School might see judicial recognition as a reflection of societal needs and values, but again, it's not the only way for customs to influence law.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I think the best answer is A. Analytical School.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
