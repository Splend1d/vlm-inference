                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which statement is correct when comparing investment projects. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that the ranking of projects by NPV is invariant to changes in the market rate. Hmm, invariant means it doesn't change, so does this mean that no matter what the market rate is, the order of projects based on NPV stays the same? I'm not entirely sure about that. I think that the NPV can change with different discount rates, so maybe the ranking isn't fixed.\n\nOption B says that the IRR will always agree with NPV metric. I recall that there are cases where NPV and IRR might give different rankings, especially if projects have different scales or timing of cash flows. So, I don't think this is always true.\n\nOption C says that the IRR never changes the ranking of the projects. Wait, is this different from option B? It seems similar. I think I need to clarify. IRR is a measure of the profitability of a project, and it's the discount rate that makes the NPV zero. But when comparing projects, sometimes IRR can lead to different rankings compared to NPV, especially if projects have different patterns of cash flows.\n\nOption D says that we should use a single metric, like NPV or IRR, to have a coherent comparison. This seems like a reasonable approach. Using multiple metrics can sometimes give conflicting signals, so sticking to one can help in making a consistent decision.\n\nLet me think again. I remember that NPV is generally considered a better criterion because it directly measures the value added to the firm. IRR can be misleading in some cases, like when projects have different sizes or unconventional cash flow patterns.\n\nSo, if I have to choose between NPV and IRR, I'd probably go with NPV as the primary criterion. But let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe question is: \"When comparing investment projects:\" and then there are four statements. I need to pick the correct one.\n\nOption A: NPV ranking is invariant to changes in the market rate. Is that true? Well, NPV does depend on the discount rate, so if the discount rate changes, NPV can change, and potentially, the ranking of projects could change too. So, I don't think this is correct.\n\nOption B: IRR always agrees with NPV. No, as I thought earlier, there are cases where they disagree.\n\nOption C: IRR never changes the ranking of projects. This seems similar to option B. Again, I think they can differ in certain scenarios.\n\nOption D: We should use a single metric for coherent comparison. This seems right. Using one consistent metric ensures that comparisons are apples to apples.\n\nSo, among these, option D seems to be the most accurate statement. It's always better to use one primary metric, like NPV, for comparing investments to maintain consistency in decision-making.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me double-check. Is there any scenario where using multiple metrics would be better? Well, sometimes, using multiple metrics can provide different perspectives, but in terms of having a coherent comparison, sticking to one metric is indeed advisable, especially since metrics like IRR and NPV can conflict in certain situations.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
