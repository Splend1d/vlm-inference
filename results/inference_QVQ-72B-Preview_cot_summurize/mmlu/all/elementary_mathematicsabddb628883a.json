                    "text": "Let's see. Molly got a haircut for $25, and she left a 15% tip. I need to find out what her final cost was. Okay, so first, I need to calculate the tip amount and then add it to the original cost of the haircut.\n\nSo, the tip is 15% of $25. To find 15% of something, I can use the percentage formula. The formula is (percentage / 100) * total amount. So, that would be (15 / 100) * $25.\n\nLet me calculate that. 15 divided by 100 is 0.15. So, 0.15 times $25. Hmm, 0.15 times 25. Well, 0.1 times 25 is 2.5, and then 0.05 times 25 is 1.25. So, added together, that's $3.75 tip.\n\nAlright, now I need to add that tip to the original cost of the haircut. So, $25 plus $3.75. Let's see, 25 plus 3 is 28, and then plus 0.75 is $28.75.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. $28.75 seems to be the correct answer. But just to double-check, maybe there's another way to calculate this.\n\nAnother way could be to calculate the total cost as the haircut cost plus the tip. So, total cost = haircut + (tip percentage * haircut). Which is what I did earlier.\n\nWait, but sometimes people might calculate it differently, like calculating the total cost as 100% of the haircut plus the tip percentage. So, total cost = 100% of $25 plus 15% of $25, which is 115% of $25.\n\nLet me try that method. To find 115% of $25. Again, using the percentage formula: (115 / 100) * $25.\n\nSo, 1.15 times $25. What's 1.15 times 25? Well, 1 times 25 is 25, and 0.15 times 25 is 3.75, so total is $28.75. Same result as before.\n\nI think that confirms it. So, the final cost should be $28.75.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if the tip is calculated on the haircut cost only or if there are any other factors. The problem says Molly got a haircut for $25 and left a 15% tip, and asks for the final cost.\n\nI don't think there are any other factors to consider here. It seems straightforward.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there might be any tax or other fees, but the problem doesn't mention any taxes or additional fees, so I don't think I need to account for those.\n\nAlso, sometimes people might round tips to the nearest dollar, but since the problem doesn't specify to round, I'll assume we need the exact calculation, which is $28.75.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $25.15\n\nB. $26.50\n\nC. $27.50\n\nD. $28.75\n\nSo, D. $28.75 is the correct answer based on my calculations.\n\nJust to make sure, let's break it down again:\n\nHaircut cost: $25.00\n\nTip: 15% of $25.00 = $3.75\n\nTotal cost: $25.00 + $3.75 = $28.75\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI don't see any errors in this calculation, so I'm confident that $28.75 is the final cost.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ \\$28.75} \\]"
