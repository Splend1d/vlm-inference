We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.\n\"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated.

                    "text": "So I've got this question about the Populist movement, and I need to find out which option is the least associated with it. The options are:\n\nA. Support of labor unions\n\nB. Secret ballot elections\n\nC. Free coinage of silver\n\nD. Deregulation of railroads and utilities\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Populist movement was all about. From what I recall, the Populist Party emerged in the late 19th century, largely in response to the struggles of farmers against big business and banks. They were advocating for reforms that would benefit ordinary people, especially farmers, who felt oppressed by the economic systems of the time.\n\nLooking at the excerpt provided from the Populist Party Platform in 1892, it's clear they were critical of the two main political parties and the influence of corporations and banks. They accuse these parties of ignoring the people's grievances and focusing on lesser issues like the tariff to distract from bigger problems like economic exploitation.\n\nSo, to answer the question, I need to identify which of these options doesn't align with the Populist movement's goals or policies.\n\nLet's consider each one:\n\nA. Support of labor unions: The Populists were known for supporting workers' rights and labor unions. They believed in the power of collective bargaining and standing up against big businesses that were exploiting workers. So, this seems pretty aligned with their platform.\n\nB. Secret ballot elections: This one sounds like a democratic reform. The Populists were big on democratic reforms to make the government more responsive to the people. Secret ballots would prevent coercion and ensure privacy in voting, which aligns with their desire for a more just and fair electoral process.\n\nC. Free coinage of silver: This is a bit more complex. The Populists were strong advocates for the free and unlimited coinage of silver. At the time, there was a debate over whether money should be backed by gold (gold standard) or both gold and silver (bimetallic standard). Farmers and other debtors favored silver coinage because it would increase the money supply and make it easier to pay off debts. So, this was a central plank in the Populist platform.\n\nD. Deregulation of railroads and utilities: Now, this one seems contradictory. From what I remember, the Populists actually advocated for more regulation of railroads and utilities, not less. They believed that these industries had too much power and were taking advantage of farmers by charging high prices for transportation and other services. So, they wanted the government to step in and regulate these industries to protect the farmers' interests.\n\nWait a minute, but the option says \"deregulation\" of railroads and utilities. That means removing regulations, right? So, if the Populists wanted more regulation to control railroads and utilities, then deregulation would be the opposite of what they advocated for.\n\nLet me double-check that. Yeah, I think I'm on the right track here. The Populists were in favor of regulating railroads and utilities to make them more fair and affordable for farmers. They saw these industries as having monopolistic powers that needed to be checked by the government.\n\nSo, advocating for deregulation would go against their platform.\n\nLet me see if there's any other context that might change this. For example, maybe in some cases, deregulation could be seen as helpful, but based on what I know about the Populist movement, their focus was on ensuring that essential services like railroads didn't overcharge farmers.\n\nTherefore, deregulation of railroads and utilities would be contrary to their goals.\n\nSo, among the options given, D. Deregulation of railroads and utilities is the least associated with the Populist movement.\n\nTo make sure, let's think about it another way. If I were a Populist in 1892, what would I think about deregulation of railroads and utilities?\n\nWell, I'd probably be against it, because railroads were seen as crucial for transporting crops to market, and high railroad rates were a major burden on farmers. The Populists wanted to see railroads regulated as public utilities, with set rates that were fair and reasonable.\n\nDeregulation would likely lead to even higher rates and more exploitation of farmers, which is exactly what the Populists were fighting against.\n\nTherefore, D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
