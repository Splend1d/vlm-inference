                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: |x - 4| - 10 = 2, and I need to find the product of all possible values of x. The options are -8, 128, -128, and 16. Alright, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to solve for x in the equation |x - 4| - 10 = 2. Okay, so absolute value equations can sometimes be a bit tricky because of the absolute value sign, but I think I remember how to handle them.\n\nLet me start by isolating the absolute value expression. So, I'll add 10 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the -10. That gives me:\n\n|x - 4| = 12\n\nOkay, now that the absolute value is by itself on one side, I recall that |a| = b means that a could be b or a could be -b, because absolute value is always non-negative. So, for my equation, that means:\n\nx - 4 = 12 or x - 4 = -12\n\nAlright, now I can solve each of these two equations separately.\n\nFirst, x - 4 = 12\n\nIf I add 4 to both sides, I get:\n\nx = 16\n\nSecond, x - 4 = -12\n\nAgain, adding 4 to both sides:\n\nx = -8\n\nSo, the possible values of x are 16 and -8.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the product of all possible values of x. So, I need to multiply 16 and -8 together.\n\n16 * -8 = -128\n\nLooking back at the options, -128 is one of them, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with |x - 4| - 10 = 2, I added 10 to both sides to get |x - 4| = 12. That seems correct.\n\nThen, setting up x - 4 = 12 and x - 4 = -12. That also seems right.\n\nSolving those gives x = 16 and x = -8.\n\nNow, multiplying 16 and -8 indeed gives -128.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I should plug these values back into the original equation to verify.\n\nFirst, x = 16:\n\n|16 - 4| - 10 = |12| - 10 = 12 - 10 = 2. That checks out.\n\nSecond, x = -8:\n\n|-8 - 4| - 10 = |-12| - 10 = 12 - 10 = 2. That also checks out.\n\nSo, both values satisfy the original equation, and their product is -128.\n\nI don't think there are any other possible values of x, because absolute value equations typically have at most two solutions, one for the positive scenario and one for the negative scenario.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. -128.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can think about it graphically. If I graph the equation |x - 4| - 10 = 2, it's the same as |x - 4| = 12. The graph of |x - 4| is a V-shape with the vertex at x = 4. The lines y = 12 and y = -12 would intersect the V-shape at x = 16 and x = -8, respectively, since from x = 4, going 12 units up or down gives x = 16 and x = -8.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the product of the solutions is -128.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-128} \\]"
