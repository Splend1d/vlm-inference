                    "text": "So I have this question about American football: \"How many points is a touchdown worth?\" And the options are A. two, B. three, C. six, D. seven. Hmm, I need to figure this out. I'm not an expert on football, but I do know some basics.\n\nFirst off, I know that in American football, there are different ways to score points, like touchdowns, field goals, and extra points. But right now, the question is specifically about a touchdown. Let me think about what a touchdown is.\n\nI remember that a touchdown happens when a player carries the football over the opponent's goal line or catches it in the end zone. That's supposed to be the main way to score points in football, right? So, it should be a significant number of points.\n\nLooking at the options, A is two points, B is three points, C is six points, and D is seven points. I think seven points seems too high for just a touchdown. I recall that a field goal, which is kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts, is worth three points. So, if a field goal is three points, a touchdown should be more than that because it's a bigger achievement.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the touchdown itself is worth six points, and then there's an extra point kick that can add one more point, making it seven points in total. Is that how it works? Let me double-check that.\n\nI think that when a team scores a touchdown, they get six points, and then they have the option to try for an extra point, which is usually a kick that, if successful, adds one more point, making it seven points in total. Alternatively, they can go for a two-point conversion, which involves running or passing the ball into the end zone again for two extra points instead of kicking for one.\n\nBut the question is asking specifically for the value of a touchdown, not including the extra point or conversion. So, in that case, a touchdown is worth six points. That would make option C the correct answer.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because sometimes people refer to the entire scoring play, including the extra point, as a touchdown. For example, you might hear someone say that a team scored a touchdown and got seven points. But technically, the touchdown itself is six points, and the extra point is additional.\n\nLet me see if I can find some confirmation for this. I recall that in the NFL rulebook, a touchdown is defined as six points. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nSo, if the question is asking for the value of a touchdown itself, without including the extra point, then it should be six points. If it were asking for the total points after the extra point, then it would be seven points. But the way the question is phrased, \"a touchdown,\" I think it's just the touchdown itself, which is six points.\n\nI should also consider if there are any exceptions or special rules that might change the point value, but I don't think so. It's pretty standard that a touchdown is six points.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any scenario where a touchdown is worth a different number of points. For example, in some sports, there are different point values based on the type of score or the situation, but in American football, I don't recall that being the case for touchdowns.\n\nWait, in college football, is there any difference in point values? I think not; touchdowns are still six points there as well. And in the NFL, it's definitely six points.\n\nAlso, I should consider if the touchdown is followed by a safety or something like that, but the question is only about the touchdown itself, so I don't think that applies here.\n\nSo, after thinking this through, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. six points.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
