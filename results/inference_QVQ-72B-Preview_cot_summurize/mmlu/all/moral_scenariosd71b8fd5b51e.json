                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I threw the frisbee to my daughter.\" Okay, so frisbee is a game, right? It's something people play for fun, usually in parks or beaches. Throwing a frisbee to someone is a normal part of playing the game. I don't see anything inherently wrong with that. Unless there's some context missing, like if they were in a dangerous location or something, but the scenario doesn't specify that. So, based on the information given, I would say this is \"not wrong.\"\n\nSecond scenario: \"I guided the plane over the tallest mountain that I could see.\" Hmm, this one seems a bit more complex. So, guiding a plane over a mountain\u2014first off, flying planes requires training and certification. If I'm a trained pilot and I'm following safe flying procedures, then maybe it's not wrong. But mountains can be tricky for flying because of terrain and weather conditions like turbulence or reduced visibility. If I'm endangering passengers or violating flight regulations, that would be morally wrong.\n\nBut the scenario says \"I guided the plane over the tallest mountain that I could see.\" It doesn't specify any dangerous conditions or that I'm not qualified to fly. Maybe I'm just flying over a mountain for scenic purposes, and as long as I'm doing it safely and legally, it shouldn't be considered wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's an implication that I'm doing this impulsively or without proper planning, which could be reckless. But again, the scenario doesn't provide those details. It just says I guided the plane over the tallest mountain I could see.\n\nLet me consider both scenarios again:\n\nScenario 1: Throwing a frisbee to my daughter. Seems harmless and playful.\n\nScenario 2: Guiding a plane over a mountain. Could be safe and responsible if done properly, or reckless if done without due caution.\n\nGiven that both scenarios lack context that would make them clearly morally wrong, I'm leaning towards \"not wrong\" for both.\n\nBut maybe there's a standard that expects pilots to follow specific flight paths and not deviate for personal reasons, like choosing a route based on seeing the tallest mountain. If that's the case, then it could be seen as irresponsible.\n\nHowever, without more information, it's hard to judge. The question specifies \"ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\" In general, playing frisbee with your daughter is a positive family activity, not morally wrong.\n\nAs for flying over a mountain, if it's part of the planned route and done safely, it's not wrong. If it's a reckless act putting lives at risk, then it's wrong. But the scenario doesn't provide enough details to determine that.\n\nPerhaps the key is that in Scenario 1, throwing a frisbee is a clear action with no negative consequences, while in Scenario 2, guiding a plane over a mountain could have potential risks, making it potentially morally questionable.\n\nBut still, without knowing more, it's speculative to assume there's danger involved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the contrast is intended between a simple, harmless action and a more significant, potentially risky one.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
