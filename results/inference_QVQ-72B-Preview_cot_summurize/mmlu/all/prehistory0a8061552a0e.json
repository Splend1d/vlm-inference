The options are:\n\nA. The architecture was clearly built by Egyptians.\n\nB. Historical records show that it was constructed by early Dutch settlers.\n\nC. Symbolic motifs incorporated into the walls indicate that they were built by Indian traders.\n\nD. They thought sub-Saharan Africans were incapable of such achievements.\n\nHmm, I need to be careful here. I know that Great Zimbabwe is an ancient city in modern-day Zimbabwe, and it's famous for its large stone walls. But there's been a lot of debate about who built it.\n\nOption A says the architecture was clearly built by Egyptians. But I don't recall any evidence linking Egyptians directly to Great Zimbabwe. It seems unlikely because Great Zimbabwe is in southern Africa, and Egyptian influence was primarily in North Africa and parts of the Middle East.\n\nOption B mentions historical records show it was constructed by early Dutch settlers. The Dutch didn't arrive in southern Africa until the 17th century, and Great Zimbabwe was built much earlier, starting around the 11th century. So, timing-wise, that doesn't add up.\n\nOption C says symbolic motifs indicate it was built by Indian traders. While there might have been trade connections between India and Great Zimbabwe, I doubt that the Indians were involved in building the walls. The motifs might be influenced by trade, but that doesn't mean they built the structures.\n\nOption D says archaeologists thought sub-Saharan Africans were incapable of such achievements. This sounds familiar. I remember learning that there was a Eurocentric bias in the past, where scholars doubted that African civilizations could have achieved such architectural feats without outside influence.\n\nWait, but I should make sure. Let me think about it. Great Zimbabwe is an Iron Age civilization, and the Shona people, who were indigenous to the region, are known to have built it. But historically, there was a tendency to attribute ancient African achievements to non-African builders, often due to racist assumptions.\n\nI think the correct answer is D. They thought sub-Saharan Africans were incapable of such achievements. This reflects the Eurocentric biases of the past, where the idea that African people could build such complex structures on their own was dismissed.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider if there's any other information that might support one of the other options. For instance, was there any evidence of Egyptian, Dutch, or Indian involvement in the construction of Great Zimbabwe?\n\nNo, I don't think so. The Egyptians were primarily in North Africa, the Dutch arrived much later, and while there might have been trade with India, there's no evidence they built the walls.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate reason why archaeologists long suggested that the walls of Great Zimbabwe could not have been built by indigenous sub-Saharan people is D. They thought sub-Saharan Africans were incapable of such achievements.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
