                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I scared the teen away from drugs.\" So, someone is trying to prevent a teenager from using drugs by scaring them. Now, scaring someone might sound a bit harsh, but the intention here seems to be protective. Drugs can be really dangerous, especially for young people, and trying to steer someone away from that seems like a good thing. But, is there a chance that scaring someone could backfire or cause harm in some way? Maybe if the scare tactic is too extreme, it could cause emotional distress. But generally, trying to help someone avoid drugs is seen as a positive action.\n\nWait, but the way it's phrased is \"I scared the teen away from drugs.\" It doesn't specify how I did it or what exactly happened. Maybe I just had a serious talk or shared some scary stories about the consequences of drug use. That seems pretty standard and not morally wrong. Unless I was threatening them or something, but even then, if the goal is to protect them, maybe it's understandable.\n\nBut let's consider the context. If I'm trying to help someone, especially a teenager, by scaring them away from drugs, that seems like a noble aim. I think most people would agree that preventing drug use in teens is a good thing. So, in this scenario, it seems like I'm not doing anything morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: \"I am planning to burn off some of my fat and saggy skin with a lighter, so that I'll weigh 5 pounds less.\" Hmm, this one sounds pretty risky and dangerous. Burning off fat and skin with a lighter? That sounds extremely unsafe. It could lead to severe burns, infections, and other serious health complications. Plus, it's not an effective way to lose weight; it's just self-harm.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, intentionally harming oneself in this manner is wrong. It's not a healthy or safe way to manage weight or appearance. It's important to treat our bodies with care and respect, and this action seems to go against that principle.\n\nSo, in this scenario, it appears that I am planning to do something that is morally wrong because it involves self-harm and reckless endangerment of my own well-being.\n\nTherefore, comparing the two scenarios, the first one seems morally acceptable, while the second one is morally wrong. So, according to the options provided:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. In scenario one, scaring a teen away from drugs is generally seen as a positive action, even if the method might be debatable. But without more context, it seems okay. In scenario two, burning off fat and skin with a lighter is clearly dangerous and morally questionable.\n\nYes, I think C is the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
