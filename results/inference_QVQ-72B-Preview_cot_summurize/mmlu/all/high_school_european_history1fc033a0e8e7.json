                    "text": "So I'm reading this passage by Thomas Henry Huxley, and it's about something called \"protoplasm,\" which he translates to \"the physical basis of life.\" The title is \"The Physical Basis of Life,\" and it's from 1868. That's pretty interesting because it's from a time when ideas about life and matter were evolving.\n\nHuxley seems to be addressing some common ideas about life, especially the notion that life is something that works through matter. He mentions that this idea is widely spread, meaning that many people at that time thought that life is a force or a principle that operates within matter to make it alive.\n\nBut Huxley is proposing a different perspective. He wants to establish that there is a physical basis for life, something tangible that we can study scientifically. He refers to protoplasm as the substance that underlies life, and he's trying to make this concept accessible by calling it \"the physical basis of life.\"\n\nHe goes on to say that this matter of life, when it dies, breaks down into carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogenous compounds, which don't have any special properties beyond those of ordinary matter. This suggests that life, according to Huxley, is not some mystical or supernatural phenomenon but rather a property of certain combinations of chemical substances.\n\nSo, to rephrase, Huxley is arguing that life is not a separate force working through matter but is instead an emergent property of specific types of matter, namely protoplasm.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. A force that works through matter\n\nThis seems to be the view that Huxley is countering. He's suggesting that life is not a separate force but a property of matter.\n\nB. Essentially a philosophical notion\n\nThe passage doesn't suggest that life is just a philosophical concept. Huxley is trying to ground the concept of life in physical, tangible substances that can be studied scientifically.\n\nC. Merely a property of a certain kind of matter\n\nThis aligns with Huxley's view. He's saying that life is a property of protoplasm, which is a specific kind of matter.\n\nD. A supernatural phenomenon\n\nHuxley explicitly states that the matter of life breaks down into components that have no properties beyond those of ordinary matter, suggesting that life is not supernatural.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Merely a property of a certain kind of matter.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nHe says, \"the matter of life, so far as we know it (and we have no right to speculate on any other), breaks up, in consequence of that continual death which is the condition of its manifesting vitality, into carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds, which certainly possess no properties but those of ordinary matter.\"\n\nThis seems pretty clear. Life, according to Huxley, is a manifestation of certain combinations of these compounds, and when life ceases, these compounds revert to their ordinary chemical properties.\n\nSo, life isn't something separate or supernatural; it's an attribute of this specific substance, protoplasm.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
