                    "text": "Okay, so I have this problem here. A person weighs 62 kilograms, and their drug dose is 15 milligrams per kilogram. I need to find out how many grams their dose is, and choose from the given options: A. 930, B. 93, C. 9.3, D. 0.93.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I have the person's weight in kilograms and the dose in milligrams per kilogram. I need to calculate the total dose in milligrams and then convert that to grams because the options are in grams.\n\nSo, the dose is 15 mg/kg, and the person weighs 62 kg. To find the total dose in milligrams, I should multiply the weight by the dose rate:\n\nTotal dose (mg) = weight (kg) \u00d7 dose (mg/kg)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal dose (mg) = 62 kg \u00d7 15 mg/kg\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n62 \u00d7 15 = 930 mg\n\nSo, the total dose is 930 milligrams.\n\nBut wait, the options are in grams, not milligrams. I need to convert milligrams to grams. I remember that 1 gram is equal to 1000 milligrams. So, to convert milligrams to grams, I should divide by 1000.\n\n930 mg \u00f7 1000 = 0.93 grams\n\nTherefore, the dose is 0.93 grams.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 930\n\nB. 93\n\nC. 9.3\n\nD. 0.93\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. 0.93.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me go through the steps again.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the dose in milligrams.\n\nDose = 62 kg \u00d7 15 mg/kg = 930 mg\n\nStep 2: Convert milligrams to grams.\n\n930 mg \u00f7 1000 = 0.93 g\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about combining the units.\n\nDose (g) = 62 kg \u00d7 15 mg/kg \u00d7 (1 g / 1000 mg)\n\nFirst, multiplying 62 kg \u00d7 15 mg/kg gives 930 mg.\n\nThen, converting 930 mg to grams: 930 mg \u00d7 (1 g / 1000 mg) = 0.93 g\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if the dose is per kilogram, does that include the units properly?\n\nLet me see: dose is 15 mg per kg, so mg/kg.\n\nWhen I multiply by kilograms, the kilograms cancel out:\n\n62 kg \u00d7 15 mg/kg = 62 \u00d7 15 mg = 930 mg\n\nThen, converting to grams:\n\n930 mg \u00f7 1000 = 0.93 g\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to convert kilograms to grams first, that might be another way to approach it.\n\n1 kilogram = 1000 grams, so 62 kg = 62 \u00d7 1000 g = 62,000 g\n\nThen, dose = 15 mg per kg = 15 mg/kg\n\nBut wait, if I'm converting kg to g, I need to adjust the dose accordingly.\n\nActually, maybe that's not the best approach. Let's stick with the initial method.\n\nTotal dose (mg) = weight (kg) \u00d7 dose (mg/kg) = 62 \u00d7 15 = 930 mg\n\nThen, convert mg to g: 930 \u00f7 1000 = 0.93 g\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI don't think there's any other factor I'm missing here. It's a straightforward calculation.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 0.93 grams.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
