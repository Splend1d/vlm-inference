                    "text": "So I've got this equation to solve: x + 71 = -22. I need to find the value of x that makes this equation true. Let's see, I remember that to solve for x, I should try to get x by itself on one side of the equation. Since 71 is being added to x, I should probably subtract 71 from both sides to isolate x.\n\nSo, starting with x + 71 = -22, I'll subtract 71 from both sides:\n\nx + 71 - 71 = -22 - 71\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\nx = -93\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can plug in the value back into the original equation to see if it works.\n\nSo, if x = -93, then:\n\n-93 + 71 = -22\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n-93 plus 71. Well, 93 - 71 is 22, but since it's negative, it should be -22. Yes, that matches the right side of the equation.\n\nSo, x = -93 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can use the properties of equality or think about the number line.\n\nLet me think about the number line. I have x plus 71 equals -22. So, x is -22 minus 71. Hmm, that's the same as what I did before: x = -22 - 71 = -93.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. It's just straightforward addition and subtraction.\n\nWait, maybe I can think about it in terms of adding negative numbers. Sometimes, that can be tricky, but in this case, it's pretty straightforward.\n\nSo, x + 71 = -22\n\nSubtract 71 from both sides:\n\nx = -22 - 71\n\nNow, -22 minus 71. Well, 22 plus 71 is 93, but since both are negative, it's -93.\n\nSo, again, x = -93.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other method or if maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Perhaps I can approach it differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way: I can subtract x from both sides, but that doesn't seem helpful. Or, I could add 22 to both sides, but that doesn't seem right because I need to isolate x.\n\nNo, I think the straightforward method is the best here. Subtract 71 from both sides to solve for x.\n\nSo, x = -93.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. -93\n\nB. -49\n\nC. 49\n\nD. 93\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. -93.\n\nI don't think it's B, because -49 plus 71 would be 22, not -22. Let me check:\n\n-49 + 71 = 22, which is not equal to -22. So, B is incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, 49 + 71 = 120, which is not -22. So, C is incorrect.\n\n93 + 71 = 164, which is not -22. So, D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, A. -93 is indeed the correct answer.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and I'm confident that -93 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-93} \\]"
