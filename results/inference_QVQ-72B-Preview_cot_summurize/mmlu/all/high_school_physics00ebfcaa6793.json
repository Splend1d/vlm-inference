                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about a particle in a conservative force field, and I need to find a position of stable equilibrium from the given options. The potential energy function is U(x) = (x \u2013 2)^3 \u2013 12x, where U is in joules and x is in meters.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what stable equilibrium means in terms of potential energy. From my physics class, I recall that in a conservative force field, a particle is in stable equilibrium at a position where the potential energy is at a local minimum. That means if you displace the particle a little bit from that position, the force will push it back towards that position because any small displacement increases the potential energy.\n\nSo, mathematically, to find the positions of equilibrium, I need to find the points where the derivative of the potential energy with respect to x is zero. That is, \u2202U/\u2202x = 0.\n\nGiven U(x) = (x \u2013 2)^3 \u2013 12x, let's compute its derivative.\n\n\u2202U/\u2202x = 3(x \u2013 2)^2 \u2013 12.\n\nSet this equal to zero to find equilibrium positions:\n\n3(x \u2013 2)^2 \u2013 12 = 0\n\n3(x \u2013 2)^2 = 12\n\n(x \u2013 2)^2 = 4\n\nSo, x \u2013 2 = \u00b12\n\nTherefore, x = 4 or x = 0.\n\nNow, to determine if these are positions of stable equilibrium, I need to check the second derivative of the potential energy at these points. If the second derivative is positive, it's a minimum, which corresponds to stable equilibrium.\n\nLet's find the second derivative of U(x):\n\n\u2202\u00b2U/\u2202x\u00b2 = 6(x \u2013 2)\n\nAt x = 4:\n\n\u2202\u00b2U/\u2202x\u00b2 = 6(4 \u2013 2) = 12, which is positive. So, x = 4 is a position of stable equilibrium.\n\nAt x = 0:\n\n\u2202\u00b2U/\u2202x\u00b2 = 6(0 \u2013 2) = -12, which is negative. This would correspond to a maximum in potential energy, which is a position of unstable equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, among the given options, x = 4 is a position of stable equilibrium.\n\nWait a minute, but the options include negative x values like x = -4 and x = -2. Maybe I should check those as well, even though they weren't found from setting the first derivative to zero.\n\nLet's see, the first derivative is \u2202U/\u2202x = 3(x \u2013 2)^2 \u2013 12.\n\nIf I plug in x = -4:\n\n\u2202U/\u2202x = 3(-4 \u2013 2)^2 \u2013 12 = 3(36) \u2013 12 = 108 \u2013 12 = 96 \u2260 0\n\nAt x = -2:\n\n\u2202U/\u2202x = 3(-2 \u2013 2)^2 \u2013 12 = 3(16) \u2013 12 = 48 \u2013 12 = 36 \u2260 0\n\nSo, x = -4 and x = -2 are not equilibrium positions because the derivative isn't zero there. Therefore, they can't be positions of stable equilibrium.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check the second derivative at x = -4 and x = -2 to see what kind of points they are.\n\nAt x = -4:\n\n\u2202\u00b2U/\u2202x\u00b2 = 6(-4 \u2013 2) = 6(-6) = -36, which is negative, indicating a maximum.\n\nAt x = -2:\n\n\u2202\u00b2U/\u2202x\u00b2 = 6(-2 \u2013 2) = 6(-4) = -24, which is also negative, indicating another maximum.\n\nSo, x = -4 and x = -2 are both positions of unstable equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, the only position of stable equilibrium from the given options is x = 4.\n\nBut wait, x = 0 was also found to be an equilibrium position, but it's unstable. So, only x = 4 is a stable equilibrium position.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. x = \u20134\n\nB. x = \u20132\n\nC. x = 0\n\nD. x = 4\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. x = 4.\n\nBut let's double-check if there are any other positions that might be stable equilibrium points.\n\nLooking back at the potential energy function U(x) = (x \u2013 2)^3 \u2013 12x.\n\nWe found that the equilibrium positions are at x = 4 and x = 0, with x = 4 being stable and x = 0 being unstable.\n\nAre there any other positions where \u2202U/\u2202x = 0?\n\nWell, we already solved \u2202U/\u2202x = 3(x \u2013 2)^2 \u2013 12 = 0, which gave x = 4 and x = 0 as the only solutions.\n\nSo, no other equilibrium positions exist.\n\nTherefore, the only position of stable equilibrium is x = 4.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
