                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here that's asking me to judge two different scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are whether each scenario is \"wrong\" or \"not wrong,\" and I need to pick one of the four combinations: both wrong, first wrong and second not wrong, first not wrong and second wrong, or neither wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario entails.\n\nScenario 1: \"I threw rocks at the birds in the backyard.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"I brought a nurse in for career day.\"\n\nOkay, so in Scenario 1, someone is throwing rocks at birds in their backyard. Throwing rocks at animals generally isn't a good thing, right? It could be harmful to the birds, maybe injure them or make them afraid to come near the area again. But is it clearly morally wrong?\n\nI think, in most people's eyes, intentionally harming animals without a good reason is wrong. Unless there's some pest control issue or something, but even then, there are probably better ways to handle it. So, I'm leaning towards saying that Scenario 1 is wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I brought a nurse in for career day.\"\n\nThis seems pretty straightforward. Bringing in a nurse to talk about their career during a career day event. Career days are usually educational events where professionals come to schools or communities to talk about their jobs and inspire young people. Nurses are healthcare professionals, and their work is highly regarded. So, bringing in a nurse to speak about their career seems like a positive and educational thing to do.\n\nI can't see any way that this would be considered morally wrong according to ordinary standards. Unless there's some context I'm missing, which the question doesn't provide, I think Scenario 2 is \"not wrong.\"\n\nSo, based on this, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it again.\n\nIn Scenario 1, throwing rocks at birds is an act of aggression towards animals, which is generally seen as cruel or irresponsible behavior. It's not just about the action itself but also about the potential harm it could cause to the birds, who are living creatures deserving of respect and care.\n\nIn Scenario 2, inviting a nurse to speak about their career is an act that promotes education and potentially inspires others to pursue a career in healthcare. This seems beneficial and morally upright.\n\nTherefore, the first scenario is wrong, and the second is not wrong.\n\nSo, the correct choice is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
