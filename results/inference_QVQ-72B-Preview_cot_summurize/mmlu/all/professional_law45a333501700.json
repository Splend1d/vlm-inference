                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out if the original borrower is still liable for a deficiency judgment after he sold the property and someone else assumed the loan. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a man who borrowed money from a lender and put up his land as collateral by mortgaging it. So, he has a note and a mortgage with the lender. Before he finished paying back the loan, he sold the land to an investor. The investor agreed to take over the loan payments, which is called \"assuming\" the loan. But the note and mortgage didn't have something called a \"due-on-sale\" clause. I think that clause usually says that if the property is sold, the entire loan becomes due immediately. Since it's not there, maybe that changes things.\n\nSo, after the sale, the investor started making the loan payments. But then, the investor missed two payments, which is called defaulting. The lender sent a notice saying they intend to speed up the loan repayment (accelerate it) unless the default is fixed within 60 days. Neither the man nor the investor made the required payment, so the lender accelerated the loan and started foreclosure proceedings, naming both the man and the investor.\n\nAfter the foreclosure sale, there was a deficiency, meaning the sale didn't cover the full amount of the loan. Now, the lender is seeking a deficiency judgment against only the man because the investor has become insolvent, which probably means they don't have any assets to pay off the debt.\n\nThe question is, will the court find the man liable for the deficiency?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. No, because the investor's express assumption of the loan released the man from liability.\n\nB. No, because the lender must first seek to obtain a deficiency judgment against the investor.\n\nC. Yes, because even after the assumption, the man remains liable as a surety of the investor in the absence of a release from the lender.\n\nD. Yes, because the note and mortgage did not contain a due-on-sale clause.\n\nHmm, I need to think about this carefully.\n\nFirst, when someone assumes a loan, does that automatically release the original borrower from liability? I don't think so. In many cases, the original borrower remains liable unless the lender agrees to release them. Maybe it depends on the terms of the assumption agreement.\n\nBut in this scenario, it doesn't mention any specific agreement between the lender and the man regarding releasing him from liability. So, perhaps the man is still on the hook for the loan.\n\nOption A says no, because the assumption released the man. But if there's no mention of the lender agreeing to release him, maybe that's not the case.\n\nOption B says no, because the lender should go after the investor first. But in many jurisdictions, if the investor is insolvent, the lender can go directly after anyone else who is liable, like the original borrower.\n\nOption C says yes, because the man remains liable as a surety unless released by the lender. Suretyship is when someone agrees to be responsible for another's debt. So, if the man didn't get a release from the lender when he sold the property, he might still be a surety for the investor's debt.\n\nOption D says yes, because there was no due-on-sale clause. I'm not sure about that. The due-on-sale clause is more about whether the lender can demand full repayment when the property is sold. It doesn't directly relate to the borrower's continuing liability for the debt.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look up what a due-on-sale clause does. If there's no due-on-sale clause, perhaps the lender can't demand full repayment upon sale, but that doesn't necessarily mean the original borrower is still liable for the debt.\n\nLet me consider the concept of novation versus assumption. Novation is when a new party takes over the obligations and the original party is released. Assumption is when a new party takes over the obligations, but the original party may still be liable unless the lender agrees to release them.\n\nIn this case, it seems like there was just an assumption by the investor, without any mention of novation or the lender agreeing to release the man from liability.\n\nSo, unless the lender agreed to release the man from the loan when the investor assumed it, the man probably remains liable.\n\nGiven that, option C seems plausible: yes, the man remains liable as a surety in the absence of a release from the lender.\n\nOption D doesn't seem directly related to the issue at hand.\n\nOption B suggests that the lender must first seek a deficiency judgment against the investor. Well, the investor is insolvent, so practically, the lender might not recover anything from them. But legally, perhaps the lender can choose to go after whoever is liable, regardless of the order.\n\nI think the key here is whether the man was released from liability when the investor assumed the loan. Since there's no indication that the lender released the man, he probably remains liable as a surety.\n\nTherefore, the court is likely to find the man liable for the deficiency.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
