The options are Commerce, Ways and Means, Education and the Workforce, and Resources. Hmm, I need to recall what each of these committees is responsible for.\n\nStarting with the Commerce Committee... I think it deals with trade, business, and maybe some economic issues. But does it specifically handle tax policy? Not sure. Maybe it touches on taxes related to trade, but I don't think it's the primary committee for tax matters.\n\nNext, Ways and Means. That sounds familiar. I think it's the main committee in the House that deals with taxes and revenue. In fact, I believe it's responsible for crafting tax legislation. So, that seems like a likely choice for someone interested in influencing tax policy.\n\nEducation and the Workforce\u2014this one probably focuses on education policy and issues related to the labor force, like job training and employment laws. While there might be some connection to taxes in terms of funding for education and workforce development, it's not primarily a tax-focused committee.\n\nResources\u2014I think this committee deals with natural resources, environmental policy, and perhaps energy issues. Again, while there might be some tax aspects related to these areas, like taxes on oil companies or environmental taxes, it's not the main committee for general tax policy.\n\nComparing all these, Ways and Means seems to be the most directly related to tax policy. It's responsible for taxation, tariffs, and other revenue measures. So, if a House member wants to influence tax policy, serving on the Ways and Means Committee would be the best way to do that.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check. Commerce might deal with trade agreements that have tax implications, but again, it's not the primary tax policy committee. Education and the Workforce is more about education and labor issues, and Resources is about environmental and natural resource policies.\n\nYes, I'm confident that Ways and Means is the correct answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Ways and Means}} \\]"
