                    "text": "So I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the profit in US dollars from a sale involving multiple currencies. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a U.S. manufacturer who produces something in Mexico and sells it in Europe. The production and shipping cost is 116.50 Mexican pesos, and the selling price is 20 euros. I need to find the profit in US dollars.\n\nOkay, so profit is generally revenue minus cost. But here, cost is in pesos, and revenue is in euros. And I need the profit in dollars. So, I guess I need to convert both the cost and revenue to dollars first and then calculate the profit.\n\nLet me write down what I know:\n\n- Production and shipping cost: 116.50 pesos\n\n- Selling price: 20 euros\n\n- Exchange rates:\n\n- 0.1099 USD per Mexican peso\n\n- 0.8928 USD per euro\n\nI need to find the profit in USD.\n\nFirst, I should convert the cost from pesos to dollars.\n\nCost in pesos is 116.50. The exchange rate is 0.1099 USD per peso. So, to find the cost in dollars, I multiply 116.50 by 0.1099.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n116.50 * 0.1099\n\nWell, 100 * 0.1099 = 10.99\n\n16.5 * 0.1099...\n\nFirst, 16 * 0.1099 = 1.7584\n\nThen, 0.5 * 0.1099 = 0.05495\n\nAdding those up: 1.7584 + 0.05495 = 1.81335\n\nSo, 116.50 * 0.1099 = 12.80805 USD\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because 100 * 0.1099 is 10.99, and 16.5 * 0.1099 is about 1.81, so total should be roughly 12.80, but let me check the exact multiplication.\n\n116.50 * 0.1099\n\nFirst, 116.5 * 0.1 = 11.65\n\nThen, 116.5 * 0.099 = 11.65 * 0.099\n\n11.65 * 0.1 = 1.165\n\n11.65 * 0.09 = 1.0485\n\nSo, 1.165 - 1.0485 = 0.1165\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should just do the multiplication directly.\n\n116.5 * 0.1099\n\nFirst, 116.5 * 0.1 = 11.65\n\nThen, 116.5 * 0.0099\n\n116.5 * 0.01 = 1.165\n\n116.5 * 0.0099 = 1.165 - 0.001165 = 1.163835\n\nSo, total cost in dollars is 11.65 + 1.163835 = 12.813835 USD\n\nOkay, so cost is approximately $12.81.\n\nNow, revenue is 20 euros. I need to convert that to dollars using the given exchange rate of 0.8928 USD per euro.\n\nSo, revenue in dollars is 20 * 0.8928\n\n20 * 0.8928\n\n20 * 0.80 = 16.0\n\n20 * 0.0928 = 1.856\n\nSo, total revenue in dollars is 16.0 + 1.856 = 17.856 USD\n\nNow, profit is revenue minus cost: 17.856 - 12.813835 \u2248 5.042165 USD\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is $5.06, which is option A.\n\nBut let me check if I missed anything.\n\nWait, is there any other conversion or consideration I need to make? Maybe I should consider more decimal places in the calculations.\n\nLet me try recalculating with more precision.\n\nFirst, cost in dollars: 116.5 * 0.1099\n\n116.5 * 0.1 = 11.65\n\n116.5 * 0.0099 = 1.15335\n\nSo, total cost in dollars: 11.65 + 1.15335 = 12.80335 USD\n\nRevenue: 20 * 0.8928\n\n20 * 0.80 = 16.0\n\n20 * 0.0928 = 1.856\n\nTotal revenue: 16.0 + 1.856 = 17.856 USD\n\nProfit: 17.856 - 12.80335 \u2248 5.05265 USD\n\nSo, approximately $5.05, which rounds to $5.06.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. $5.06\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 5.06} \\]"
