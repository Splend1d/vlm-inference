Internal troubles threatened to have a fatal effect on the further progress of this obstinate war. The destinies of Russia, the honor of her heroic Army, the happiness of the people, and the whole future of our beloved country demand that the war should be conducted at all costs to a victorious end.\nThe cruel enemy is making his last efforts and the moment is near when our valiant Army, in concert with our glorious Allies, will finally overthrow the enemy. In these decisive days in the life of Russia we have thought that we owed to our people the close union and organization of all its forces for the realization of a rapid victory; for which reason, in agreement with the Imperial Duma, we have recognized that it is for the good of the country that we should abdicate the Crown of the Russian State and lay down the Supreme Power.\"\nTsar Nicholas II, Abdication, March 15, 1917\nSource 2:\n\"History will not forgive revolutionaries for procrastinating when they could be victorious today (and they certainly will be victorious today), while they risk losing much tomorrow, in fact, the risk losing everything.\nIf we seize power today, we seize it not in opposition to the Soviets but on their behalf.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Lenin's call to power in Source 2, and it's asking what the principal philosophical underpinning was. The options are capitalism, mercantilism, fascism, and Marxism. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what's being asked. It's about the main idea or the guiding theory behind Lenin's appeal to seize power in October 1917. I remember that Lenin was a key figure in the Russian Revolution and that he was influenced by certain political theories.\n\nLet me recall what each of these terms means:\n\nA. Capitalism: This is an economic system where the means of production are owned by private individuals or corporations, and it's based on free markets and competition. In capitalism, the government plays a minimal role in economic affairs.\n\nB. Mercantilism: This is an economic theory from the 16th to the 18th centuries that emphasized accumulating wealth through trade surpluses and protecting domestic industries. It advocated for strong state control over the economy to build national power.\n\nC. Fascism: This is a political ideology that emerged in the early 20th century, characterized by extreme nationalism, authoritarian rule, and often, a cult of personality around a leader. It involves strong centralization of power and suppression of opposition.\n\nD. Marxism: This is a political and economic theory developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, which analyzes history in terms of class struggles. It advocates for a classless society achieved through revolution and the abolition of private property.\n\nNow, considering Lenin's background, I know that he was a Marxist. He believed in the ideas of Karl Marx and adapted them to the Russian context, which led to the development of Marxism-Leninism. So, Marxism seems like a plausible answer.\n\nBut let me think deeper. In Source 2, Lenin is calling for the seizure of power by the revolutionaries, emphasizing the urgency to act immediately to save the revolution and the country from various crises, like war and famine.\n\nHe mentions that seizing power is not against the Soviets but on their behalf, and that the political purpose will become clear after the seizure. He also warns that procrastination could lead to losing everything, including the chance for peace and land reforms for peasants.\n\nGiven this context, it's clear that Lenin is advocating for a proletarian revolution, where the working class overthrows the existing government to establish a socialist state. This is in line with Marxist principles, which predict that the proletariat will rise up against the bourgeoisie to create a classless society.\n\nMoreover, Lenin's emphasis on the urgency of action and the need to seize power to address the pressing issues of war, hunger, and social inequality aligns with Marxist ideas of revolutionary change.\n\nLet me consider if any of the other options could be relevant.\n\nCapitalism: Lenin was certainly not advocating for a capitalist system. He saw capitalism as the root of social inequalities and exploitation, which needed to be overthrown.\n\nMercantilism: This seems even less relevant. Mercantilism was about building national wealth through trade and protectionism, which wasn't the focus of Lenin's revolution. His aim was to establish a socialist state based on communal ownership and production.\n\nFascism: Fascism emerged in Europe after World War I, particularly in Italy and Germany, advocating for strong nationalist and authoritarian rule. Lenin's ideology was opposed to fascism; he was a communist who believed in internationalism and class struggle, not nationalism.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, Marxism is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any overlap or influence from other ideologies.\n\nFor example, some might argue that Lenin incorporated elements from other theories, but in the context of his call to power in October 1917, his actions were firmly rooted in Marxist principles of proletarian revolution.\n\nAlso, considering the historical context, the Russian Revolution was a response to the failures of the capitalist and tsarist systems, and Lenin's Bolshevik Party was explicitly Marxist in its ideology.\n\nSo, I'm confident that Marxism is the principal philosophical underpinning of Lenin's call to power in Source 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D.
