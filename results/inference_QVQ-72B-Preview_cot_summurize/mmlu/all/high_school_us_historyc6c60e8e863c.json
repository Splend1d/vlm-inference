                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln, and it's trying to see how Lincoln's actions in 1860 contradicted Douglass's views from 1857. Let me try to unpack this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Douglass was saying in 1857. From the excerpt, he's criticizing the pro-slavery forces for having a lot of organizational and governmental support. He mentions that state governments in slave states are fully behind slavery, churches in those states support it, and even the federal government, including the army, navy, and Supreme Court, is pledged to support and defend slavery. He also mentions that these powerful entities are arrayed against \"the simple truth\" preached by humble people in obscure places, likely abolitionists.\n\nSo, Douglass is highlighting the extensive institutional backing of slavery, from local to national levels, and expressing dismay at how the government and other influential institutions are used to uphold and propagate slavery.\n\nNow, the question is asking in what way Abraham Lincoln's actions in 1860 contradicted Douglass's sentiments. That means I need to find an action by Lincoln in 1860 that went against what Douglass was saying about the pro-slavery advantage in organization and support.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Lincoln promoted the freedom of settlers within territories to determine the slave status of their new state.\n\nHmm, this sounds like the idea of popular sovereignty, where settlers in a territory decide whether to allow slavery or not. But I think that was more associated with Stephen Douglas than Lincoln. Let me check.\n\nIn 1860, Lincoln was running for president on the Republican Party ticket, which generally opposed the extension of slavery into new territories. I think he wasn't in favor of popular sovereignty because he believed it would lead to the expansion of slavery. So, this option seems to contradict what I know about Lincoln's position.\n\nWait, but the question is about contradicting Douglass's sentiments. How does this relate to Douglass's criticism of the pro-slavery advantage?\n\nWell, if Lincoln was promoting popular sovereignty, that might align with Douglass's view that pro-slavery forces have an advantage because they're organized. But I think Lincoln actually opposed popular sovereignty, so maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe Lincoln did support some form of popular sovereignty early on but changed his position later. I need to recall his stance in 1860 specifically.\n\nIn 1860, Lincoln was clearly opposed to the extension of slavery into the territories. He believed that the federal government should prevent slavery from spreading into new areas. So, he probably didn't promote the freedom of settlers to determine slave status; instead, he favored a federal policy restricting slavery in the territories.\n\nWait, but the option says he promoted it. That seems inconsistent with his known positions. Maybe this isn't the correct answer.\n\nMoving on to option B: Lincoln passed the Homestead Act to give free land to all western settlers.\n\nI know that the Homestead Act was indeed passed during Lincoln's presidency, but I think it was in 1862, after he became president. However, in 1860, he was still a candidate running for president; he wasn't in office yet. So, he couldn't have passed the Homestead Act in 1860 because he wasn't president until 1861.\n\nTherefore, this option is probably incorrect because it places an action in 1860 when Lincoln had no authority to pass such legislation.\n\nNext, option C: Lincoln favored the exclusion of slavery from any of the new territories.\n\nThis seems to align with what I know about Lincoln's positions. He was known for his opposition to the extension of slavery into the western territories. In fact, this was a key plank of the Republican Party platform in 1860.\n\nIf this is accurate, then how does this contradict Douglass's sentiments?\n\nWell, Douglass was criticizing the pro-slavery forces for having institutional support, including from the federal government. If Lincoln favored excluding slavery from new territories, that would be opposing the pro-slavery advantage Douglass was describing.\n\nBut is this a contradiction of Douglass's sentiments? Douglass was lamenting the support for slavery, and Lincoln's position would be against that support.\n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is that Lincoln was advocating against the pro-slavery advantage by opposing slavery's extension, thereby contradicting the idea that all organizational and governmental power was behind slavery.\n\nThat could make sense. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Douglass was criticizing how pro-slavery forces had the backing of the government, and Lincoln's position in 1860 was to use the government to restrict slavery's expansion, thus contradicting that advantage.\n\nYes, that seems plausible. So, option C might be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me check option D: Lincoln enacted the policy of giving newly freed slaves \"forty acres and a mule.\"\n\nThis is a reference to the Freedmen's Bureau, which was established during the Reconstruction era after the Civil War. The \"forty acres and a mule\" promise was part of Special Field Order No. 15, issued by General William Tecumseh Sherman in 1865, which allocated land to former slaves in the Southeastern United States.\n\nHowever, Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865, so any policies enacted after that would be under his successor, Andrew Johnson.\n\nMoreover, the \"forty acres and a mule\" policy was more of a field order by Sherman and not directly enacted by Lincoln.\n\nTherefore, this option is likely incorrect because it places an action after 1860, when Lincoln was no longer president, and attributes it directly to him in 1860, which didn't happen.\n\nSo, eliminating options A, B, and D, option C seems to be the most accurate.\n\nTo summarize, in 1860, Abraham Lincoln favored the exclusion of slavery from any new territories, which contradicted Frederick Douglass's sentiment in 1857 that pro-slavery forces had a decided advantage due to complete organization and governmental support.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
