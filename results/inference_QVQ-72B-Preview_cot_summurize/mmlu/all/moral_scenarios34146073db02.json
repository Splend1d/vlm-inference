                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about moral wrongs, and it's giving me two scenarios. I need to figure out which one of them is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, first wrong and second not wrong, or first not wrong and second wrong. So, I need to evaluate each scenario separately and see where they stand morally.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1: \"I sat on the couch while I watched TV with the cat.\"\n\nSo, here I am, sitting on the couch, watching TV with my cat. Seems pretty innocuous, right? I mean, it's just relaxing at home with a pet. There doesn't seem to be any harm done to anyone or anything. Maybe I'm taking a break, or maybe it's part of my routine. But is there anything morally wrong with this?\n\nWell, I can think of a few things that might be relevant. For instance, maybe I have other responsibilities that I'm neglecting by sitting on the couch and watching TV. Like, maybe I should be doing chores, studying, or spending time with family. But the scenario doesn't specify any of that. It just says I sat on the couch and watched TV with the cat.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the cat and I are both enjoying the moment, and there's nothing wrong with that. Cats are known for their comforting presence, and watching TV can be a way to bond with a pet. So, in this light, it seems like a positive or at least neutral activity.\n\nIs there any way this could be considered morally wrong? Well, perhaps if I'm ignoring someone who needs my help or if I'm watching inappropriate content. But again, the scenario doesn't specify what I'm watching or who else is around. So, based on the information given, it seems like a harmless activity.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I used my new computer graphics skills to create a custom report card that was not real and presented it to my widowed mother in hopes that she would be proud.\"\n\nOkay, this one is more complex. Here, I'm using my skills to create a fake report card to make my mother proud. First off, let's consider the context. My mother is widowed, which might mean she's going through a tough time, and I want to make her feel better by showing her a good report card.\n\nBut wait, the report card is fake. That means it's not an actual official document from school or college; it's something I made myself. So, I'm deceiving my mother by presenting something that isn't real as if it were real.\n\nNow, why am I doing this? The scenario says I'm hoping she'll be proud. So, maybe I didn't do well in school, or maybe I didn't even attend, and I feel bad about disappointing her. By creating a fake report card, I'm trying to spare her feelings or to make her happy.\n\nBut is this morally wrong? Well, lying is generally considered wrong, especially when it involves deceiving someone you love. My mother is trusting me to be honest with her, and by presenting a fake report card, I'm breaking that trust.\n\nMoreover, academic integrity is important, and falsifying a report card could be seen as cheating or fraud. Even if I'm not using it for any official purpose, just the act of creating a fake document might be ethically questionable.\n\nAnother angle: My mother is widowed, so perhaps she's relying on my honesty and support more than ever. Deceiving her in this way could hurt her deeply if she ever finds out. It's not just about the report card; it's about the relationship between us.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe I have good intentions. I want to see her smile, and I thought this was a harmless way to achieve that. But good intentions don't always justify deceptive actions, especially when they involve lying to someone close to you.\n\nPerhaps there are better ways to make my mother proud without resorting to deception. I could work harder in school, find other achievements to share with her, or simply express my love and appreciation for her.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems that creating and presenting a fake report card to my mother is morally wrong.\n\nNow, going back to the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, Scenario 1 seems morally acceptable, while Scenario 2 is morally wrong. Therefore, the correct choice should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something in Scenario 1 that I'm missing. Sitting on the couch and watching TV with the cat\u2014seems pretty harmless. Unless there's some underlying context that makes it wrong, which isn't provided in the scenario, I think it's safe to say it's not morally wrong.\n\nIn contrast, creating a fake report card to deceive my mother is clearly morally wrong, as it involves lying and breaking trust.\n\nSo, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
