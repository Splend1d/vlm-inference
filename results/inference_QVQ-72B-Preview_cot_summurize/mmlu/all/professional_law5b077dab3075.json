                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out the best way for the patient to raise a genuine dispute of material fact in this medical malpractice case. The hospital has moved for summary judgment, claiming there are no disputed facts, and they've submitted their radiologist's report saying there were no signs of cancer on the X-ray. But the patient's cancer was diagnosed six months later based on the same X-ray, which suggests that the hospital missed something. Now, the patient wants to show that there is a dispute about whether the hospital should have diagnosed the cancer earlier.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Submit a report from the patient's expert radiologist contradicting the findings in the hospital's radiologist's report.\n\nThis seems straightforward. If the patient's expert looks at the same X-ray and sees signs of cancer that the hospital's radiologist missed, that could be strong evidence that there was a failure to diagnose. This would directly challenge the hospital's claim that there were no signs of cancer on the X-ray.\n\nB. Submit an affidavit from the patient's attorney detailing his conversations with the patient's expert radiologist.\n\nHmm, this is a bit indirect. An affidavit from the attorney about what the expert said might not be as persuasive as having the expert's direct statement. Courts generally prefer evidence directly from the expert, not secondhand through the attorney. So, this might not carry as much weight.\n\nC. Submit an affidavit from the patient's expert radiologist with findings that contradict the report of the hospital's radiologist.\n\nThis is similar to option A but in the form of an affidavit. An affidavit is a sworn statement, which can be strong evidence. If the expert radiologist swearing under oath that they see signs of cancer on the X-ray, that would directly contradict the hospital's radiologist's report and create a dispute about the facts.\n\nD. Submit the patient's medical records showing the patient's current cancer diagnosis.\n\nWhile this shows that the patient has cancer now, it doesn't directly address whether the cancer was present and diagnosable six months earlier based on the X-ray. The fact that the cancer was diagnosed later doesn't necessarily prove that it could have been diagnosed earlier.\n\nSo, comparing these options, I think option C is the strongest. An affidavit from the patient's expert radiologist directly contradicting the hospital's radiologist's report would create a genuine dispute about whether the X-ray showed signs of cancer. This dispute would be material to the case because it goes to the heart of the malpractice claim: whether the hospital should have diagnosed the cancer earlier.\n\nOption A is also strong, but an affidavit from the expert might be even better because it's a sworn statement, which can carry more weight in court. Plus, it's directly from the expert, not filtered through the attorney.\n\nOption B is weaker because it's the attorney's statement about what the expert said, which might not be as reliable or admissible.\n\nOption D, while relevant, doesn't directly address the key issue of whether the cancer was present on the X-ray six months earlier.\n\nTherefore, I believe the best way for the patient to raise a genuine dispute of material fact is to submit an affidavit from the patient's expert radiologist with findings that contradict the report of the hospital's radiologist.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
