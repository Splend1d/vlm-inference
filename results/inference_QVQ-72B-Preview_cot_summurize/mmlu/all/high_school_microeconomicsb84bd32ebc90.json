                    "text": "So I have this question about how a tax imposed on a supplier might be passed on to consumers in the form of a price increase. The options are related to the price elasticity of demand, and there's also a mention of wage elasticity. Hmm, I need to recall what price elasticity of demand means and how it affects the ability of suppliers to pass on taxes through higher prices.\n\nFirst off, price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in its price. If demand is elastic, a small increase in price will lead to a relatively larger decrease in quantity demanded. Conversely, if demand is inelastic, a price increase will result in a smaller percentage decrease in quantity demanded.\n\nNow, when a tax is imposed on a supplier, it increases the supplier's costs. To compensate for this, the supplier might try to raise the price of the good. But whether they can successfully pass on the entire tax to consumers depends on how responsive consumers are to that price increase.\n\nLet me think about this. If demand is highly elastic, meaning consumers are very sensitive to price changes, then raising the price by the full amount of the tax would likely cause a significant drop in sales. As a result, the supplier probably wouldn't be able to pass on the full tax amount because consumers would buy much less. So, in this case, the tax would be less likely to be passed on fully to consumers.\n\nOn the other hand, if demand is highly inelastic, consumers are less sensitive to price changes. So, even if the price goes up by the full amount of the tax, quantity demanded doesn't drop much. This means the supplier can pass on more of the tax to consumers without losing many sales.\n\nWait a minute, there's also the concept of unit elasticity. That's when the percentage change in quantity demanded equals the percentage change in price, so total revenue doesn't change. But in this scenario, since we're dealing with a tax-induced cost increase, the supplier would probably try to adjust prices to maximize profits, considering the elasticity of demand.\n\nSo, between the options given:\n\nA. Price elasticity of demand is highly elastic.\n\nB. Price elasticity of demand is highly inelastic.\n\nC. Price elasticity of demand is unit elastic.\n\nD. Wage elasticity of demand is highly elastic.\n\nI need to pick the one where the tax is more likely to be passed on through higher prices.\n\nGiven my earlier reasoning, it seems that if demand is highly inelastic, the supplier can more easily pass on the tax to consumers via higher prices because consumers won't reduce their purchases as much.\n\nBut let me double-check this. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the supplier can absorb some of the tax if demand is elastic, knowing that consumers would buy less at higher prices. Whereas if demand is inelastic, the supplier has more leverage to pass on the tax through higher prices because consumers won't decrease their purchases significantly.\n\nYes, that reinforces my initial thought.\n\nNow, what about option C, where demand is unit elastic? In this case, a price increase would lead to a proportional decrease in quantity demanded, meaning total revenue stays the same. Would the supplier be able to pass on the full tax in this scenario?\n\nProbably not, because the quantity sold decreases as much as the price increases, so the supplier might not be able to cover the full tax amount without losing revenue.\n\nTherefore, the best scenario for the supplier to pass on the tax through higher prices is when demand is highly inelastic.\n\nWait, but option D mentions wage elasticity of demand. Hmm, that seems out of place. Wage elasticity of demand refers to how the quantity demanded responds to changes in consumer income, not directly to price changes. So, that doesn't seem directly relevant to passing on a tax through higher prices.\n\nTherefore, I can eliminate option D.\n\nBetween A, B, and C, I think B is the correct answer: price elasticity of demand is highly inelastic.\n\nLet me see if there's any other perspective I should consider.\n\nFor example, maybe the supply side matters too. If supply is elastic, suppliers can adjust their production in response to price changes, which might affect how the tax is passed on.\n\nBut the question specifies that the tax is imposed on the supplier, so it's more about the supplier's ability to shift the tax burden to consumers via higher prices, which is primarily determined by the elasticity of demand.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the correct answer is B: price elasticity of demand is highly inelastic.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
