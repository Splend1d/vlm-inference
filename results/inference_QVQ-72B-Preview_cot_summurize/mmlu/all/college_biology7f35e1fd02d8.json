                    "text": "Let's see. I have this genetics problem here. It's about pea plants and their traits for height and flower color. So, the alleles for tall plants are D (dominant) and d (recessive), and for flower color, it's W (violet, dominant) and w (white, recessive). I need to figure out what the offspring will look like when a tall violet plant with genotype DDWw is crossed with a dwarf white plant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each parent is contributing. The tall violet plant is DDWw. Since it's homozygous for tall (DD), its height won't vary. For flower color, it's heterozygous (Ww), so it can pass on either W or w.\n\nThe dwarf white plant is presumably ddww, right? Because dwarf is d, and white is w, and since it's a dwarf white plant, it should be homozygous recessive for both traits.\n\nSo, the cross is DDWw \u00d7 ddww.\n\nNow, to find the phenotypic ratio of the progeny, I should probably make a Punnett square or at least list out the possible gametes and see how they combine.\n\nLet's list the gametes for each parent.\n\nFor DDWw:\n\n- Since it's DD, all gametes will have D.\n\n- For Ww, the gametes can have either W or w.\n\nSo, the possible gametes from DDWw are DW and Dw.\n\nFor ddww:\n\n- All gametes will have d and w.\n\nSo, the gametes from ddww are dw.\n\nNow, let's cross these gametes:\n\n- D W \u00d7 d w \u2192 Dd Ww\n\n- D w \u00d7 d w \u2192 Dd ww\n\nWait, no. Actually, it's DDWw \u00d7 ddww.\n\nWait, no. Hold on. DDWw produces gametes DW and Dw, and ddww produces gametes dw.\n\nSo, crossing them:\n\n- DW \u00d7 dw \u2192 Dd Ww\n\n- Dw \u00d7 dw \u2192 Dd ww\n\nSo, the offspring genotypes are Dd Ww and Dd ww.\n\nNow, what are their phenotypes?\n\nDd is tall (since D is dominant over d).\n\nWw is violet (W is dominant over w).\n\nww is white.\n\nSo, Dd Ww will be tall violet.\n\nDd ww will be tall white.\n\nSo, the progeny are tall violet and tall white.\n\nThere are no dwarf plants in the offspring because Dd is still tall.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 1 tall violet: 1 tall white.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. All tall violet\n\nB. 1 tall violet: 1 dwarf violet\n\nC. 1 tall violet: 1 tall white: 1 dwarf violet: 1 dwarf white\n\nD. 1 tall violet: 1 tall white\n\nSo, option D seems to match my calculation.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any chance of getting dwarf plants?\n\nWell, D is dominant over d, and the mother is DD, so all offspring get at least one D, making them tall. So, no dwarfs.\n\nSo, options B and C are incorrect because they include dwarfs.\n\nOption A says all tall violet, but we have tall white as well, so that's not right.\n\nOption D is 1 tall violet: 1 tall white, which matches my earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, but is the ratio 1:1?\n\nYes, because for every DW gamete from the mother, combined with dw from the father, gives Dd Ww (tall violet), and for every Dw gamete from the mother combined with dw from the father, gives Dd ww (tall white). So, assuming equal chances for DW and Dw gametes, the ratio should be 1:1.\n\nBut wait, is the mother producing equal numbers of DW and Dw gametes?\n\nYes, because W and w are alleles of the same gene, and D is fixed as D since it's homozygous.\n\nWait, but D and W are on different chromosomes, right? Or are they linked?\n\nThe problem doesn't specify linkage, so I can assume independent assortment unless told otherwise.\n\nBut in this case, since D is fixed as DD, only W and w are segregating.\n\nWait, but D is on one chromosome, and W is on another, I think.\n\nActually, in peas, height and flower color are on different chromosomes, so they assort independently.\n\nSo, the gametes from DDWw are DW and Dw in equal proportions.\n\nCrossed with ddww, which produces only dw gametes.\n\nSo, DW + dw \u2192 Dd Ww (tall violet)\n\nDw + dw \u2192 Dd ww (tall white)\n\nSo, yes, equal proportions.\n\nHence, the correct answer is D. 1 tall violet: 1 tall white.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
