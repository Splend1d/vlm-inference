                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this expectancy theory of motivation, and there's this term called \"valence\" that's supposed to be really important. It's one of the factors that affects worker motivation, according to the theory. The question is asking what \"valence\" refers to, and there are four options to choose from. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst off, expectancy theory is all about how people are motivated based on their expectations about their efforts leading to certain outcomes. There are three key components in this theory: expectancy, instrumentality, and valence. I think valence is the one we're focusing on here.\n\nOption A says that valence is the employee's beliefs about the value of rewards provided for successful performance. That sounds plausible because if someone values the rewards they get from doing a good job, they might be more motivated to perform well.\n\nOption B says it's the employee's beliefs about the inherent (intrinsic) value of the work itself. So, this would be more about finding satisfaction in the work for its own sake, not just for the rewards it brings. That also seems like it could be a part of motivation.\n\nOption C mentions the strength of the worker's motivation and organizational commitment. Hmm, that seems a bit circular because motivation is what we're trying to explain here. Maybe valence is related to motivation, but I'm not sure if it's the same thing.\n\nOption D talks about the strength of the effort (versus ability) component of the worker's motivation. This seems a bit confusing. Expectancy theory does consider both effort and ability, but I'm not sure how valence fits into that specifically.\n\nLet me try to recall the formula for expectancy theory. I think it's Motivation = Expectancy \u00d7 Instrumentality \u00d7 Valence. But I might be mixing it up with Vroom's expectancy theory, which has a similar formula: Motivation = Expectancy \u00d7 Instrumentality \u00d7 Valence.\n\nWait, actually, in Vroom's expectancy theory, the formula is Motivation = Expectancy \u00d7 Instrumentality \u00d7 Valence. So, Expectancy is the belief that effort will lead to performance, Instrumentality is the belief that performance will lead to certain outcomes, and Valence is the attractiveness or value of those outcomes.\n\nThat rings a bell. So, if that's the case, then valence would be related to the value the employee places on the rewards or outcomes they could receive for performing well.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. the employee\u2019s beliefs about the value of rewards provided for successful performance.\n\nB. the employee\u2019s beliefs about the inherent (intrinsic) value of the work itself.\n\nC. the strength of the worker's motivation and organizational commitment.\n\nD. the strength of the effort (versus ability) component of the worker\u2019s motivation.\n\nOption A seems to align closely with the definition of valence as the value or attractiveness of the rewards. Option B is more about intrinsic motivation, which might be considered separately. Option C is about motivation and commitment, which are outcomes rather than inputs. Option D is about the effort component, which seems more related to expectancy.\n\nSo, based on this, I think Option A is the correct answer. Valence refers to the employee's beliefs about the value of rewards provided for successful performance.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about an example. Suppose an employee is offered a bonus for meeting certain performance targets. If the employee highly values that bonus, say because they need the money for a downpayment on a house, then their valence for that reward would be high, and according to the theory, they should be more motivated to work towards achieving those targets.\n\nOn the other hand, if the reward is something they don't care much about, like a company-branded mug when they already have plenty, then the valence would be low, and so would their motivation to work for it.\n\nSo, this seems to fit with Option A.\n\nOption B, the inherent value of the work, might be more related to intrinsic motivation, which is a different concept from valence in expectancy theory.\n\nOption C, strength of motivation and organizational commitment, seems like it might be an outcome of high valence, but not the definition of valence itself.\n\nOption D, the strength of the effort component, seems more related to expectancy, which is the belief that effort will lead to performance.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that Option A is the correct choice. Valence refers to the employee's beliefs about the value of rewards provided for successful performance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
