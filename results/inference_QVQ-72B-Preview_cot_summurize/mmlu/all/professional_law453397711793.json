                    "text": "So I've got this property law problem here, and I need to figure out who owns this 20-acre tract of land. There are a few transactions involved, and it's all about when deeds were recorded. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a recording statute in place that says: \"No conveyance is good against a subsequent purchaser for a valuable consideration and without notice, unless the same be recorded prior to subsequent purchase.\" Okay, so basically, if someone buys a piece of land and doesn't record their deed, and then someone else buys it later without knowing about the first sale, the first buyer might not have priority unless their deed was recorded before the second sale.\n\nSo, the original owner sells the land to the buyer on May 1 for $40,000 using a quitclaim deed. But the buyer doesn't record this deed right away. Then, on August 1, the owner sells the same land to an investor for $75,000 using a warranty deed. The investor didn't know about the first sale to the buyer when he bought it. The buyer finally records his deed on August 10, and the investor records his deed on August 15.\n\nNow, there's a lawsuit to determine who really owns the land. All interested parties are involved, so I assume both the buyer and the investor are claiming ownership.\n\nLet me think about this. The recording statute seems crucial here. It says that a subsequent purchaser who buys without notice of a prior unrecorded deed will have priority if their own deed is recorded first. Or, if the prior deed is recorded before the subsequent purchase, then the prior buyer has priority.\n\nIn this case, the buyer bought on May 1 but didn't record until August 10. The investor bought on August 1 and recorded on August 15, without knowing about the buyer's prior deed.\n\nSo, at the time the investor bought on August 1, the buyer's deed was still unrecorded. The investor had no actual knowledge of the buyer's deed. Then, the buyer recorded his deed on August 10, and the investor recorded on August 15.\n\nAccording to the statute, since the investor was a subsequent purchaser without notice of the buyer's deed and recorded his deed after the buyer, does that mean the buyer has priority because his deed was recorded first?\n\nWait, but the statute says that no conveyance is good against a subsequent purchaser for valuable consideration and without notice unless the conveyance is recorded prior to the subsequent purchase.\n\nSo, in this case, the buyer's deed was not recorded prior to the investor's purchase on August 1. Therefore, the investor, who bought without knowledge of the buyer's deed, should have priority because his deed was recorded later, but he was unaware of the prior unrecorded deed.\n\nBut then, the buyer recorded his deed on August 10, which was after the investor's purchase but before the investor recorded his own deed.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here. Let me look up how this works.\n\nIn general, in most jurisdictions, the first to record their deed has priority, especially if the subsequent purchaser was without notice of the prior unrecorded deed at the time of their purchase.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the investor bought without knowledge of the buyer's prior unrecorded deed, and then the buyer recorded his deed after the investor's purchase but before the investor recorded his deed.\n\nI think the key here is that the investor was without notice at the time of his purchase, and the buyer's deed was not recorded prior to the investor's purchase.\n\nTherefore, the investor should have priority and own the land, even though the buyer recorded his deed first.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive. Usually, the first to record has priority, but in this case, the investor was without notice and bought for a higher price.\n\nLet me consider the options:\n\nA. The buyer, because his deed preceded the investor's deed.\n\nBut the investor was without notice and bought later, so maybe the buyer doesn't have priority.\n\nB. The buyer, because his deed was recorded prior to the investor's deed.\n\nWell, the buyer recorded on August 10, and the investor recorded on August 15, so yes, the buyer recorded first. But the investor was without notice at the time of purchase.\n\nC. The investor, because he is protected by the recording statute.\n\nThis seems plausible. The statute protects subsequent purchasers without notice who record their deeds.\n\nD. The investor, because he took title by warranty deed and the buyer took title by quitclaim deed.\n\nThis might be relevant, but I think the type of deed is less important than the recording dates and knowledge of prior deeds.\n\nI think the correct answer is C. The investor, because he is protected by the recording statute.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nThe recording statute says that no conveyance is good against a subsequent purchaser for valuable consideration and without notice unless the conveyance is recorded prior to the subsequent purchase.\n\nIn this case, the buyer's conveyance was not recorded prior to the investor's purchase. The investor was without notice of the buyer's deed at the time of his purchase. Therefore, the investor should have priority.\n\nEven though the buyer recorded his deed first, the investor was a bona fide purchaser without notice, and his deed was recorded later.\n\nSo, in this situation, the investor should be found to have title to the tract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
