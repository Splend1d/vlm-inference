                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Ben rolls two fair six-sided dice, and we need to find the expected value of the larger number between the two dice. If both numbers are the same, that number is considered the larger one. Okay, got it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what expected value means. The expected value of a random variable is the long-run average of the variable's value after many repetitions of the experiment. So, in this case, if I roll two dice many times and record the larger number each time, the expected value would be the average of all those larger numbers.\n\nSince the dice are fair and six-sided, each die has an equal chance of landing on any number from 1 to 6. There are a total of 6 \u00d7 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice.\n\nOne way to approach this is to find all possible pairs of dice rolls and determine the larger number for each pair. Then, find the average of these larger numbers.\n\nLet's start by listing all possible outcomes and their corresponding larger numbers.\n\nThe possible pairs are:\n\n- (1,1): larger number is 1\n\n- (1,2): larger number is 2\n\n- (1,3): larger number is 3\n\n- (1,4): larger number is 4\n\n- (1,5): larger number is 5\n\n- (1,6): larger number is 6\n\n- (2,1): larger number is 2\n\n- (2,2): larger number is 2\n\n- (2,3): larger number is 3\n\n- (2,4): larger number is 4\n\n- (2,5): larger number is 5\n\n- (2,6): larger number is 6\n\n- (3,1): larger number is 3\n\n- (3,2): larger number is 3\n\n- (3,3): larger number is 3\n\n- (3,4): larger number is 4\n\n- (3,5): larger number is 5\n\n- (3,6): larger number is 6\n\n- (4,1): larger number is 4\n\n- (4,2): larger number is 4\n\n- (4,3): larger number is 4\n\n- (4,4): larger number is 4\n\n- (4,5): larger number is 5\n\n- (4,6): larger number is 6\n\n- (5,1): larger number is 5\n\n- (5,2): larger number is 5\n\n- (5,3): larger number is 5\n\n- (5,4): larger number is 5\n\n- (5,5): larger number is 5\n\n- (5,6): larger number is 6\n\n- (6,1): larger number is 6\n\n- (6,2): larger number is 6\n\n- (6,3): larger number is 6\n\n- (6,4): larger number is 6\n\n- (6,5): larger number is 6\n\n- (6,6): larger number is 6\n\nNow, let's tabulate the frequency of each possible larger number.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- 1 appears once\n\n- 2 appears three times\n\n- 3 appears five times\n\n- 4 appears seven times\n\n- 5 appears nine times\n\n- 6 appears eleven times\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's double-check.\n\nFrom the list above:\n\n- (1,1): 1\n\n- (1,2) and (2,1): both have 2\n\n- (1,3), (3,1): both have 3\n\n- (1,4), (4,1): both have 4\n\n- (1,5), (5,1): both have 5\n\n- (1,6), (6,1): both have 6\n\n- (2,2): 2\n\n- (2,3), (3,2): both have 3\n\n- (2,4), (4,2): both have 4\n\n- (2,5), (5,2): both have 5\n\n- (2,6), (6,2): both have 6\n\n- (3,3): 3\n\n- (3,4), (4,3): both have 4\n\n- (3,5), (5,3): both have 5\n\n- (3,6), (6,3): both have 6\n\n- (4,4): 4\n\n- (4,5), (5,4): both have 5\n\n- (4,6), (6,4): both have 6\n\n- (5,5): 5\n\n- (5,6), (6,5): both have 6\n\n- (6,6): 6\n\nSo, let's tally the frequencies again:\n\n- 1: 1\n\n- 2: 3\n\n- 3: 5\n\n- 4: 7\n\n- 5: 9\n\n- 6: 11\n\nWait, but total outcomes are 36, and 1+3+5+7+9+11 = 36. That checks out.\n\nNow, to find the expected value, I need to calculate the average of the larger numbers, taking into account their frequencies.\n\nSo, expected value E[X] = (sum of (larger number * frequency)) / total number of outcomes\n\nLet's compute that.\n\nSum for 1: 1 * 1 = 1\n\nSum for 2: 2 * 3 = 6\n\nSum for 3: 3 * 5 = 15\n\nSum for 4: 4 * 7 = 28\n\nSum for 5: 5 * 9 = 45\n\nSum for 6: 6 * 11 = 66\n\nTotal sum = 1 + 6 + 15 + 28 + 45 + 66\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\n1 + 6 = 7\n\n7 + 15 = 22\n\n22 + 28 = 50\n\n50 + 45 = 95\n\n95 + 66 = 161\n\nSo, total sum is 161\n\nTotal number of outcomes is 36\n\nTherefore, E[X] = 161 / 36\n\nBut looking back at the options, they all have 161 in the numerator, but differ in the denominator.\n\nOption A: 161/6\n\nOption B: 161/36\n\nOption C: 161\n\nOption D: 161/3\n\nSo, according to my calculation, it should be 161/36, which is option B.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, confirm the frequencies:\n\n- 1: 1\n\n- 2: 3\n\n- 3: 5\n\n- 4: 7\n\n- 5: 9\n\n- 6: 11\n\nSum: 1*1 + 2*3 + 3*5 + 4*7 + 5*9 + 6*11\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n1*1 = 1\n\n2*3 = 6\n\n3*5 = 15\n\n4*7 = 28\n\n5*9 = 45\n\n6*11 = 66\n\nSum: 1 + 6 = 7\n\n7 + 15 = 22\n\n22 + 28 = 50\n\n50 + 45 = 95\n\n95 + 66 = 161\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTotal number of outcomes is indeed 36.\n\nSo, E[X] = 161/36.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: 161/36.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about the problem using probability.\n\nThe expected value of the larger number can also be calculated by finding the expected value of the maximum of two dice rolls.\n\nThe formula for the expected value of the maximum of two uniform random variables can be derived, but since we're dealing with discrete uniform variables (dice rolls), it's simpler to use the frequency approach we already have.\n\nAlternatively, we could consider that for two dice, the probability that the larger number is at least k is (k/6)^2, since there are k^2 outcomes where both dice show numbers from 1 to k.\n\nBut actually, the probability that both dice show numbers less than or equal to k is (k/6)^2.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the maximum is exactly k is the probability that it's less than or equal to k minus the probability that it's less than or equal to k-1.\n\nSo, P(max = k) = P(max \u2264 k) - P(max \u2264 k-1) = (k/6)^2 - ((k-1)/6)^2\n\nLet's compute that:\n\nP(max = k) = (k/6)^2 - ((k-1)/6)^2 = (k^2 - (k-1)^2)/36 = (k^2 - (k^2 - 2k +1))/36 = (2k -1)/36\n\nSo, P(max = k) = (2k -1)/36 for k = 1 to 6\n\nTherefore, the expected value E[max] = sum from k=1 to 6 of k * P(max = k) = sum from k=1 to 6 of k*(2k -1)/36\n\nSo, E[max] = (1*(1) + 2*(3) + 3*(5) + 4*(7) + 5*(9) + 6*(11))/36\n\nWait, this seems consistent with what we had earlier.\n\nBecause:\n\nFor k=1: (2*1 -1)/36 = 1/36\n\nk=2: (4 -1)/36 = 3/36\n\nk=3: (6 -1)/36 = 5/36\n\nk=4: (8 -1)/36 = 7/36\n\nk=5: (10 -1)/36 = 9/36\n\nk=6: (12 -1)/36 = 11/36\n\nSo, E[max] = (1*(1/36) + 2*(3/36) + 3*(5/36) + 4*(7/36) + 5*(9/36) + 6*(11/36))\n\n= (1/36)*(1 + 6 + 15 + 28 + 45 + 66) = (1/36)*161 = 161/36\n\nAgain, confirming that the expected value is 161/36.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to consider the possible sums or other properties, but I think the approach we've taken is solid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 161/36, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{161}{36}} \\]"
