                    "text": "So Zoey is building a patio using bricks, and the salesman wants to sell as many bricks as possible without any leftovers. The patio is 12 feet by 10 feet, and each brick is 4 inches by 6 inches by 2 inches. We need to find out how many bricks Zoey needs to cover the patio with one layer of bricks, and the options are from 5,760 down to 1,440.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the dimensions correctly. The patio is 12 feet by 10 feet, and since bricks are usually measured in inches, I should probably convert the patio dimensions to inches to match. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:\n\n12 feet \u00d7 12 inches/foot = 144 inches\n\n10 feet \u00d7 12 inches/foot = 120 inches\n\nSo the patio is 144 inches by 120 inches.\n\nEach brick is 4 inches by 6 inches by 2 inches. The problem says the bricks are being laid in a single layer, so I assume they're being placed flat on the ground, covering an area of 4 inches by 6 inches.\n\nWait a minute, the bricks are 4 inches by 6 inches by 2 inches. If they're being laid in a single layer, I need to figure out how they're oriented. Are they lying flat with the 4x6 face on the ground, or is there another way?\n\nLet me think about the orientation. If they're being laid flat with the 4x6 face down, then each brick covers an area of 4 inches by 6 inches on the patio. But I need to make sure that the thickness is consistent with the patio's thickness being one brick layer.\n\nBut the problem says \"a thickness of one brick,\" but it's a patio, which is typically just a flat surface, so maybe the thickness is just the height of one brick, which is 2 inches.\n\nWait, but the bricks are 2 inches thick, so if the patio is being covered with one layer of bricks, the total thickness would be 2 inches.\n\nBut the problem is about selling bricks, not building the patio structure itself. Maybe I don't need to worry about the patio's thickness, just the area to be covered by the bricks in a single layer.\n\nSo, calculate the area of the patio and divide by the area covered by one brick.\n\nFirst, find the area of the patio:\n\n144 inches \u00d7 120 inches = 17,280 square inches.\n\nEach brick covers 4 inches \u00d7 6 inches = 24 square inches.\n\nSo, number of bricks needed = patio area / area per brick = 17,280 / 24 = 720 bricks.\n\nBut that's not among the options provided. The options are much larger numbers, like 5,760, which is way more than 720.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the bricks aren't being laid flat, or maybe there's another way they're being arranged.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"the patio area is a rectangle with dimensions 12 feet by 10 feet, and each individual brick is 4 inches by 6 inches by 2 inches. What would be the greatest number of bricks the salesman could sell to meet his sales criteria?\"\n\nIt says \"a thickness of one brick,\" meaning the patio is being covered with a single layer of bricks, standing on their side, perhaps.\n\nWait, if the bricks are being stood on their smallest face, that would be the 2-inch by 4-inch face. Then, each brick would cover an area of 2 inches by some length, depending on how they're arranged.\n\nBut I think I'm overcomplicating this. The problem likely means that the bricks are being laid flat on the ground, covering the patio area with their largest face down, which is 4 inches by 6 inches.\n\nSo, area covered per brick is 4 inches \u00d7 6 inches = 24 square inches.\n\nPatio area is 144 inches \u00d7 120 inches = 17,280 square inches.\n\nNumber of bricks needed: 17,280 / 24 = 720 bricks.\n\nBut since that's not an option, maybe there's a different arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bricks are being laid in a different orientation, like standing on their smallest face, covering an area of 2 inches by some length.\n\nIf the bricks are standing on their 2-inch by 4-inch face, then the area each brick covers would be 2 inches by 4 inches = 8 square inches.\n\nThen, number of bricks needed would be 17,280 / 8 = 2,160 bricks.\n\nThat's one of the options, 2,160.\n\nBut is this a valid arrangement? If the bricks are standing on their smallest face, would that be practical for a patio? Patios are typically flat surfaces, so having bricks standing on edge might not make sense, unless they're being embedded in concrete or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bricks are being laid on their 2-inch by 6-inch face, covering an area of 2 inches by 6 inches = 12 square inches per brick.\n\nThen, number of bricks needed would be 17,280 / 12 = 1,440 bricks.\n\nThat's another option.\n\nBut I'm not sure which orientation is correct. Maybe I need to consider different possible arrangements.\n\nLet me think differently. Perhaps the bricks are being laid in courses, like in a wall, but for a patio, it's likely they're laid flat on the ground.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the patio isn't just a single layer; maybe it's multiple layers of bricks.\n\nBut the problem says \"a thickness of one brick,\" which suggests a single layer.\n\nWait, maybe the bricks are being laid in a specific pattern that requires more bricks.\n\nFor example, if they're being laid in a staggered pattern, like in bricklaying for walls, where each row offsets from the previous one, that might require more bricks for the same area.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to account for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a need for cutting bricks at the edges, which would require additional bricks.\n\nBut the problem says \"not having any extra bricks,\" so maybe that's not the case.\n\nLet me consider the area again.\n\nPatio area: 12 feet by 10 feet = 144 inches by 120 inches.\n\nBrick dimensions: 4 inches by 6 inches by 2 inches.\n\nIf bricks are laid flat, covering 4 inches by 6 inches, then:\n\n- If laid with the 4-inch side along the 144-inch side:\n\nNumber of bricks along 144 inches: 144 / 4 = 36 bricks\n\nAlong 120 inches: 120 / 6 = 20 bricks\n\nTotal bricks: 36 \u00d7 20 = 720 bricks\n\n- Alternatively, if bricks are rotated, with the 6-inch side along the 144-inch side:\n\nNumber of bricks along 144 inches: 144 / 6 = 24 bricks\n\nAlong 120 inches: 120 / 4 = 30 bricks\n\nTotal bricks: 24 \u00d7 30 = 720 bricks\n\nEither way, it's still 720 bricks.\n\nBut that's not matching any of the options.\n\nMaybe the bricks are being stood on edge.\n\nIf bricks are standing on their 2-inch by 4-inch face, then:\n\n- Area covered per brick: 2 inches \u00d7 4 inches = 8 square inches\n\n- Total bricks needed: 17,280 / 8 = 2,160 bricks\n\n- That's option C.\n\nAlternatively, if bricks are standing on their 2-inch by 6-inch face:\n\n- Area covered per brick: 2 inches \u00d7 6 inches = 12 square inches\n\n- Total bricks needed: 17,280 / 12 = 1,440 bricks\n\n- That's option D.\n\nBut I'm not sure why the bricks would be standing on edge for a patio. Patios are usually laid flat for walking on.\n\nMaybe the bricks are being used in a different way, like building up the patio in layers, but the problem says \"a thickness of one brick.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bricks are being used to cover the patio in a pattern that requires overlapping or some other arrangement that uses more bricks.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the patio isn't just a single layer but multiple layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the patio is being built with multiple layers of bricks.\n\nIf it's a multi-layer patio, then the number of bricks would be higher.\n\nBut the problem says \"a thickness of one brick,\" which suggests a single layer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bricks are being used vertically around the edges or something like that, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bricks are being used to cover not just the patio area but also some border or something, but the problem specifies the patio area is 12 feet by 10 feet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the units.\n\nWait, the patio is 12 feet by 10 feet, which is 120 square feet.\n\nEach brick covers, if laid flat, 4 inches by 6 inches, which is 24 square inches, or 24/144 = 0.1667 square feet.\n\nSo, number of bricks needed: 120 / 0.1667 \u2248 720 bricks, same as before.\n\nBut that's not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, if bricks are standing on edge, covering 2 inches by 4 inches = 8 square inches, or 8/144 \u2248 0.0556 square feet.\n\nThen, number of bricks needed: 120 / 0.0556 \u2248 2,160 bricks, which is option C.\n\nAlternatively, standing on the other edge, 2 inches by 6 inches = 12 square inches, or 12/144 = 0.0833 square feet.\n\nThen, number of bricks needed: 120 / 0.0833 \u2248 1,440 bricks, which is option D.\n\nBut I still don't know which orientation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bricks are being used in a different configuration, like covering both the patio area and some additional area around it.\n\nBut the problem says \"not having any extra bricks,\" so that doesn't seem likely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bricks are being used in a stacked configuration, like building up the patio in layers, but again, the problem says \"a thickness of one brick.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bricks are being used to cover the patio in a pattern that requires more bricks due to overlapping or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, but assuming it's correctly stated, maybe the bricks are being used in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bricks are being used to cover not just the patio area but also some path leading to it, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bricks are being used to build some structure on the patio, like a low wall or something, but again, that seems beyond the scope of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bricks are being used in a different orientation that I haven't considered.\n\nWait, maybe the bricks are being laid on their side, covering an area of 4 inches by 2 inches, for example.\n\nIf bricks are laid on their side with the 4-inch by 2-inch face down, then each brick covers 4 inches by 2 inches = 8 square inches.\n\nThen, number of bricks needed: 17,280 / 8 = 2,160 bricks, which is option C.\n\nAlternatively, if they're laid on their 6-inch by 2-inch face down, covering 6 inches by 2 inches = 12 square inches per brick.\n\nThen, number of bricks needed: 17,280 / 12 = 1,440 bricks, which is option D.\n\nBut I'm still not sure which orientation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bricks are being used in a different way, like covering both sides of the patio or something, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bricks are being used to cover the patio in a pattern that requires more bricks due to the way they interlock or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bricks are being used in multiple layers, but the problem says \"a thickness of one brick.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bricks are being used to cover not just the patio area but also some border or something, but again, the problem specifies the patio area is 12 feet by 10 feet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the area.\n\nWait, let's double-check the patio area.\n\nPatio is 12 feet by 10 feet, which is 120 square feet.\n\nEach brick, if laid flat, covers 4 inches by 6 inches, which is 24 square inches, or 24/144 = 0.1667 square feet.\n\nNumber of bricks needed: 120 / 0.1667 \u2248 720 bricks.\n\nBut that's not
