                    "text": "So I've got this question about the Navigation Acts of 1651, and it's asking which economic philosopher's theories these acts conflict with. The options are Thomas Malthus, Josiah Child, Adam Smith, and Jean-Baptiste Colbert. I need to figure out whose ideas wouldn't align with these acts.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the Navigation Acts of 1651 were all about. From the excerpts, it seems like these acts were regulating trade, specifically specifying that goods from certain regions could only be imported into England or its territories in ships that belonged to the English people or the people of their plantations, and that the master and mariners had to be English too. There's also a part about goods from Europe only being imported in ships from the country where the goods were produced, but again, with exceptions for English ships.\n\nSo, essentially, these acts were protecting English shipping interests and trying to ensure that trade was controlled by the English. This sounds like a mercantilist policy, where the government intervenes in the economy to strengthen the nation's power and wealth, particularly by controlling trade and commerce.\n\nNow, I need to see which of these economists was against mercantilism or had theories that conflict with such protective trade measures.\n\nLet me recall what each of them believed in:\n\nA. Thomas Malthus: He's famous for his theory on population growth, suggesting that populations tend to increase geometrically while food supplies grow arithmetically, leading to potential shortages. I don't think he was particularly known for opposing mercantilism.\n\nB. Josiah Child: He was an English merchant and writer, known for his involvement in the East India Company. He advocated for free trade and was critical of some mercantilist policies. Maybe he could be a candidate.\n\nC. Adam Smith: He's the father of modern economics, known for his advocacy of free markets and opposition to government intervention in trade. He strongly criticized mercantilism and promoted free trade.\n\nD. Jean-Baptiste Colbert: He was a French statesman who implemented mercantilist policies in France, focusing on increasing national wealth through protective tariffs and subsidies to domestic industries. So, he was actually a proponent of mercantilism.\n\nGiven that, it seems like Adam Smith and possibly Josiah Child would have issues with the Navigation Acts, as they were in favor of free trade and against government intervention in trade.\n\nBut between Smith and Child, who is more prominently associated with free trade ideas? Adam Smith is probably the more well-known figure for his advocacy of laissez-faire economics and free trade in his work \"The Wealth of Nations.\"\n\nThe Navigation Acts imposed restrictions on trade, specifying which ships could carry which goods, which is the opposite of Adam Smith's ideas of free trade where goods should be able to move across borders without such restrictions.\n\nThomas Malthus, while important, was more focused on population and resources, and doesn't directly conflict with the Navigation Acts in the same way.\n\nJean-Baptiste Colbert was actually in favor of such mercantilist policies, so the Navigation Acts would align with his beliefs rather than conflict with them.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. Adam Smith.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
