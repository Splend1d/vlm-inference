Being obliged and having an obligation\n\nD. Corporeal and incorporeal rights\n\nI need to pick which one Hart distinguishes between in his analysis of law. I'm not super familiar with Hart's work, but I think I can work through this.\n\nFirst off, I know that Hart was an influential legal philosopher, and he wrote a famous book called \"The Concept of Law.\" From what I recall, his work is about understanding what law is and how it functions in society. So, his analysis likely involves distinguishing between different aspects of law.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Cause and effect\n\nCause and effect are concepts related to causality, where one event (the cause) leads to another event (the effect). While this might be relevant in some legal contexts, like in tort law where causation is important, I don't think this is a central distinction in Hart's analysis of law. So, maybe not the best choice.\n\nOption B: Theory and fact\n\nThis seems interesting. Theory versus fact is a common distinction in many fields, including law. In law, theory might refer to the principles or ideas that underpin legal rules, while fact would refer to the actual existence or application of those rules in reality. Hart was known for discussing the relationship between law and morality, and between positivist and natural law theories. Perhaps he makes a distinction between the theoretical underpinnings of law and the factual existence of legal systems. This could be a possible answer.\n\nOption C: Being obliged and having an obligation\n\nThis one seems a bit nuanced. \"Being obliged\" might refer to a subjective feeling or perception that one should do something, maybe based on moral or ethical considerations. \"Having an obligation\" could refer to a more objective legal duty imposed by law. So, this distinction might be relevant in Hart's analysis, especially since he discusses the difference between internal and external points of view in legal systems. Maybe this is the answer.\n\nOption D: Corporeal and incorporeal rights\n\nCorporeal refers to physical things, like property or one's body, while incorporeal refers to intangible things, like intellectual property or rights over ideas. In law, distinguishing between corporeal and incorporeal rights is important, especially in property law. However, I don't recall Hart making this specific distinction as a central part of his analysis of law. He might discuss it, but it's not his primary focus.\n\nAfter considering all these options, I think Option C: Being obliged and having an obligation is the most accurate answer. Hart's work emphasizes the importance of social rules and the distinctions between different types of obligations in legal systems. So, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
