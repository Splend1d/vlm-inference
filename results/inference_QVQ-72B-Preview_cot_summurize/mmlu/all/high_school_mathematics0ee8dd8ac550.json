                    "text": "So I have this probability problem here. It says that John has five children, and I need to find the probability that at least half of them are girls. I'm supposed to assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal, so each child has a 50% chance of being a boy or a girl. That seems straightforward.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"at least half\" means in this context. Since John has five children, half of five is 2.5, so \"at least half\" would mean having 3 or more girls out of five children.\n\nSo, I need to calculate the probability of having 3, 4, or 5 girls out of five children.\n\nI remember that this kind of problem can be solved using binomial probability. The binomial probability formula is:\n\n\\[ P(k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of trials (children)\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of successful trials (girls)\n\n- \\( p \\) is the probability of success on each trial (0.5 for girls)\n\n- \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) is the combination of \\( n \\) things taken \\( k \\) at a time\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 5 \\), \\( p = 0.5 \\), and \\( k \\) is 3, 4, or 5.\n\nSo, the probability that at least half are girls is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{at least half girls}) = P(3) + P(4) + P(5) \\]\n\nI need to calculate each of these probabilities and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate \\( P(3) \\):\n\n\\[ P(3) = \\binom{5}{3} (0.5)^3 (0.5)^{5-3} = 10 \\times (0.5)^5 = 10 \\times 0.03125 = 0.3125 \\]\n\nNext, \\( P(4) \\):\n\n\\[ P(4) = \\binom{5}{4} (0.5)^4 (0.5)^{5-4} = 5 \\times (0.5)^5 = 5 \\times 0.03125 = 0.15625 \\]\n\nAnd \\( P(5) \\):\n\n\\[ P(5) = \\binom{5}{5} (0.5)^5 (0.5)^{5-5} = 1 \\times (0.5)^5 = 1 \\times 0.03125 = 0.03125 \\]\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{at least half girls}) = 0.3125 + 0.15625 + 0.03125 = 0.5 \\]\n\nSo, the probability is 0.5, which is the same as \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, \\( \\binom{5}{3} = 10 \\), which is correct.\n\n\\( (0.5)^3 = 0.125 \\), and \\( (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \\), so \\( 0.125 \\times 0.25 = 0.03125 \\), multiplied by 10 gives 0.3125. That seems correct.\n\nNext, \\( \\binom{5}{4} = 5 \\), \\( (0.5)^4 = 0.0625 \\), and \\( (0.5)^1 = 0.5 \\), so \\( 0.0625 \\times 0.5 = 0.03125 \\), multiplied by 5 gives 0.15625. Correct.\n\nThen, \\( \\binom{5}{5} = 1 \\), \\( (0.5)^5 = 0.03125 \\), and \\( (0.5)^0 = 1 \\), so \\( 0.03125 \\times 1 = 0.03125 \\). Correct.\n\nAdding them up: 0.3125 + 0.15625 + 0.03125 = 0.5. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the symmetry here. Since each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl, and there are an odd number of children (five), the probability of having at least half girls should be the same as having at least half boys. And since these are the only two possibilities (ignoring the possibility of non-binary genders as per the assumption), each should have a probability of 0.5.\n\nSo, this matches my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but let's consider another approach to confirm.\n\nI can calculate the probability of having fewer than half girls, which would be having 0, 1, or 2 girls, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{at least half girls}) = 1 - P(\\text{fewer than half girls}) = 1 - [P(0) + P(1) + P(2)] \\]\n\nLet's calculate \\( P(0) \\), \\( P(1) \\), and \\( P(2) \\).\n\n\\( P(0) = \\binom{5}{0} (0.5)^0 (0.5)^5 = 1 \\times 1 \\times 0.03125 = 0.03125 \\)\n\n\\( P(1) = \\binom{5}{1} (0.5)^1 (0.5)^4 = 5 \\times 0.5 \\times 0.0625 = 0.15625 \\)\n\n\\( P(2) = \\binom{5}{2} (0.5)^2 (0.5)^3 = 10 \\times 0.25 \\times 0.125 = 0.3125 \\)\n\nNow, sum them up:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{fewer than half girls}) = 0.03125 + 0.15625 + 0.3125 = 0.5 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ P(\\text{at least half girls}) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 \\]\n\nAgain, I get the same result.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, both approaches give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nBut let me think about this differently. Maybe I can consider the total number of possible outcomes for five children. Each child can be a boy or a girl, so there are \\( 2^5 = 32 \\) possible combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to have exactly \\( k \\) girls is \\( \\binom{5}{k} \\), as I used earlier.\n\nSo, the probability of having exactly \\( k \\) girls is \\( \\binom{5}{k} / 32 \\).\n\nTherefore, the probability of having at least half girls (3, 4, or 5 girls) is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{at least half girls}) = \\frac{\\binom{5}{3} + \\binom{5}{4} + \\binom{5}{5}}{32} = \\frac{10 + 5 + 1}{32} = \\frac{16}{32} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nAgain, I get the same result.\n\nI think this is solid. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I should account for.\n\nIs there any dependency between the genders of the children? The problem states that each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl, and I assume they are independent events. So, no need to account for any dependency.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that with an odd number of children, the probability of having more girls than boys or more boys than girls should be equal, due to the symmetry in the probabilities.\n\nTherefore, the probability of having at least half girls should be equal to the probability of having at least half boys, and since these are the only two possibilities, each must have a probability of 0.5.\n\nThis aligns perfectly with my earlier calculations.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider a smaller case. Suppose John had three children. What would be the probability of having at least half girls?\n\nUsing the same approach:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{at least half girls}) = P(2) + P(3) = \\binom{3}{2} (0.5)^3 + \\binom{3}{3} (0.5)^3 = 3 \\times 0.125 + 1 \\times 0.125 = 0.375 + 0.125 = 0.5 \\]\n\nAgain, the probability is 0.5.\n\nWait, but in this smaller case, it's also 0.5. So, it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, for five children, perhaps there's a pattern or a general formula I can use for any odd number of children.\n\nBut I think I've confirmed it sufficiently through different methods.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), which corresponds to option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ \\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
