It says, \"According to Butler, it is impossible to:\n\nA. approve of the actions of others without imitating them.\n\nB. do something of which one does not oneself approve.\n\nC. be motivated by genuine benevolence.\n\nD. do that which is good and not to approve of it.\"\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall who Butler is and what his main ideas are. I think Butler refers to Joseph Butler, an English bishop and philosopher who wrote in the 18th century. He's known for his moral philosophy, particularly his views on human nature and morality.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Approve of the actions of others without imitating them.\n\nDoes Butler think that if we approve of someone else's actions, we must imitate them? Hmm. I don't recall anything specific about imitation in his work. His main focus was more on the nature of human motivation and morality. So maybe this isn't directly related to his core ideas.\n\nOption B: Do something of which one does not oneself approve.\n\nIs Butler saying it's impossible to do something we don't approve of? That seems interesting. I remember that Butler had ideas about the relationship between our approvals and our actions. He might have thought that our moral sense guides our actions, so if we disapprove of something, we wouldn't do it.\n\nOption C: Be motivated by genuine benevolence.\n\nIs Butler suggesting that it's impossible to be truly benevolent? That doesn't sound right. I think he actually valued benevolence and saw it as an important part of human nature.\n\nOption D: Do that which is good and not to approve of it.\n\nThis seems similar to option B but from a different angle. It's saying that if we do something good, we must approve of it. So, it's impossible to do good without approving of it.\n\nNow, between options B and D, both seem related to the connection between action and approval. Butler was known for his view that human nature has a moral sense that influences our behavior. He believed that our moral faculty approves or disapproves of actions based on certain principles.\n\nLet me consider option B again: \"do something of which one does not oneself approve.\" If Butler thought that our moral sense guides our actions, then it would make sense that we couldn't do something we disapprove of. However, this seems a bit too strong. In reality, people often do things they know are wrong or disapprove of, due to various pressures or weaknesses.\n\nOn the other hand, option D says, \"do that which is good and not to approve of it.\" This seems to suggest that if an action is good, then one must approve of it. But is it impossible to do good without approving of it? Well, sometimes people might perform good deeds without fully approving of them, perhaps out of duty or social expectation.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to look back at Butler's specific works to find the answer. I recall that Butler wrote \"Sermon on Human Nature,\" and later \"Analogy of Religion.\" In these works, he discussed the idea that human nature is designed by God and that our moral sense is a guide to right action.\n\nIn particular, Butler argued that our moral faculty is a reliable guide because it is part of God's design. He believed that when we act according to our moral sense, we are acting in accordance with our nature and with divine will.\n\nGiven that, perhaps he would say that it's impossible to do something we don't approve of, because our moral sense would prevent us from acting against our approval.\n\nBut let me think deeper. Butler was also aware of human weakness and the possibility of acting against one's better judgment. He acknowledged that people can yield to temptation and act contrary to their moral sense.\n\nSo, if he recognized that people can act against their approvals, then option B might not be the best choice.\n\nNow, considering option D: \"do that which is good and not to approve of it.\" This seems to suggest that if an action is good, one must approve of it. But is that necessarily true according to Butler?\n\nWell, Butler believed in the objectivity of moral truths and that our moral sense is a faculty that perceives these truths. So, if an action is good, our moral sense should approve of it. Therefore, it would be impossible to do something good without approving of it, because our moral sense is designed to recognize and approve of good actions.\n\nWait, but what if someone does a good deed out of self-interest or fear of punishment, without genuinely approving of the deed? Would Butler consider that possible?\n\nI think Butler would say that in such cases, the person might be acting from a motive other than benevolence, but their moral sense would still approve of the good deed. However, the motivation might not be purely benevolent.\n\nSo, perhaps Butler would argue that it's impossible to do something good without some level of approval, even if the primary motivation isn't purely benevolent.\n\nBut I need to be careful here. Maybe I should consider his concept of self-love and benevolence. Butler distinguished between self-love, which is a natural concern for one's own welfare, and benevolence, which is a concern for the welfare of others.\n\nHe believed that both are natural affections in humans, but benevolence should guide our actions because it aligns with the greater good.\n\nGiven that, perhaps he would say that it's impossible to do something good without approving of it, because our moral sense is designed to recognize and approve of actions that promote the greater good.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Maybe I should look for a specific quote or principle from Butler that directly addresses this.\n\nAfter some research, I find that Butler did emphasize the importance of our moral sense and its role in guiding our actions. He believed that our moral faculty is a reliable guide because it is part of our nature and reflects divine wisdom.\n\nIn his \"Sermon on Human Nature,\" Butler discusses the idea that our moral sense approves of certain actions and disapproves of others based on their conformity to reason and the good of society.\n\nGiven that, it seems plausible that Butler would hold that it's impossible to do something good without approving of it, because our moral sense is designed to recognize and approve of good actions.\n\nHowever, I also recall that Butler acknowledged the complexity of human motivation and the possibility of conflicting motives.\n\nFor example, in \"Analogy of Religion,\" he discusses the tension between self-love and benevolence and how they can sometimes conflict.\n\nIn such cases, might he allow for the possibility that someone could perform a good deed without fully approving of it, perhaps out of a sense of duty or fear of consequences?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he would argue that even in such cases, the person's moral sense still approves of the good deed, even if their primary motivation isn't purely benevolent.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider the structure of the question again.\n\nThe question is: \"According to Butler, it is impossible to:\n\nA. approve of the actions of others without imitating them.\n\nB. do something of which one does not oneself approve.\n\nC. be motivated by genuine benevolence.\n\nD. do that which is good and not to approve of it.\"\n\nOption A seems unrelated to Butler's main ideas. Option C suggests it's impossible to be motivated by genuine benevolence, which contradicts Butler's view that benevolence is a natural and important part of human nature.\n\nOption B suggests it's impossible to do something we don't approve of, which, as I thought earlier, might be too strong. Butler did recognize human weakness and the possibility of acting against one's moral sense.\n\nOption D, on the other hand, aligns more closely with Butler's emphasis on the reliability of our moral sense. If something is good, our moral sense should approve of it, so it would be impossible to do something good without approving of it.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D: do that which is good and not to approve of it.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider another perspective. Suppose someone does a good deed but feels conflicted about it, perhaps because they believe it's not truly good or because it conflicts with another value they hold.\n\nIn such a case, would Butler consider that person not truly approving of the deed, or just having conflicting approvals?\n\nGiven that Butler believed in the objectivity of moral truths and the reliability of our moral sense, I think he would argue that if an action is truly good, our moral sense would approve of it, despite any conflicting feelings.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to do something good without approving of it, according to Butler.\n\nSo, my final answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
