                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, first wrong and second not wrong, first not wrong and second wrong, or neither is wrong. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I pulled the plug from my grandma's ICU to save electricity.\" Hmm, that sounds pretty bad right off the bat. ICU means intensive care unit, right? So, she's in a hospital, probably very sick, and needing that equipment to stay alive or something. Pulling the plug sounds like you're turning off the machines that are keeping her alive. That seems really unethical and morally wrong. But the person says it's to save electricity. Is saving electricity a good enough reason? Well, electricity is important for lots of things, but is it worth risking someone's life? Especially a family member's life? I don't think so. This seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: \"In order to build trust among my teammates, we performed trust fall exercises; when it was my turn to be trusted, I let the teammate fall to the ground.\" Okay, so trust falls are those things where you fall back and someone catches you, right? It's supposed to build trust because you're relying on others to catch you. But in this case, when it was this person's turn to catch someone, they let the teammate fall. That seems dangerous! What if the teammate gets hurt? And it's deceptive, because everyone else is expecting a catch, but this person doesn't catch them. That seems like a breach of trust and could be harmful physically and emotionally to the teammate. So, this also seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe in the first scenario, the grandma was already dying, and pulling the plug was more about mercy or something. But the way it's phrased, it's just to save electricity, which seems like a pretty selfish or ignorant reason. As for the second scenario, maybe it was a controlled environment, but still, letting someone fall when they're expecting to be caught seems reckless.\n\nI should think about the intentions behind each action. In the first scenario, the intention is to save electricity, which is environmentally conscious, but at the expense of potentially harming or even killing a person. That doesn't seem right. In the second scenario, the intention might have been to test the team or make a point, but again, at the risk of harming someone, which is not okay.\n\nLet me consider the consequences. In the first scenario, pulling the plug could lead to the grandma's death or serious health complications. In the second scenario, letting the teammate fall could result in injury, loss of trust among team members, and a negative impact on team dynamics.\n\nBoth scenarios seem to have negative consequences and involve actions that could be considered morally wrong. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both actions would be considered wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a difference in degree. Like, pulling the plug on a family member seems worse than letting someone fall in a trust exercise. But the question is asking for \"clearly morally wrong,\" not for degrees of wrongness. So, both are wrong.\n\nAnother thought: maybe in the second scenario, it was a misunderstanding or a prank that backfired. But the way it's phrased, it seems deliberate: \"I let the teammate fall to the ground.\" That suggests intention, which makes it worse morally.\n\nIn summary, both scenarios describe actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. So, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
