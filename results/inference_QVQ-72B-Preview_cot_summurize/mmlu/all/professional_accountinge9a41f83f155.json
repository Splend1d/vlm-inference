                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what should be included in an accountant's report when they're compiling projected financial statements. The question is asking about a separate paragraph that needs to be included in the report. Let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says the report should disclaim any form of assurance on the historical financial statements. Hmm, but if the accountant is compiling projected financial statements, wouldn't they be based on historical data? I think the projection is forward-looking, so maybe disclaiming assurance on historical statements isn't the main point here. Maybe it's more about the projections themselves.\n\nOption B expresses limited assurance that the results will be within the projected range. Limited assurance sounds like some level of confidence, but projections are inherently uncertain, especially over longer periods. Maybe expressing limited assurance isn't the primary purpose of the separate paragraph. Perhaps there's something else more important to include.\n\nOption C mentions describing the limitations on the usefulness of the projection. This seems relevant because projections are based on assumptions and can be affected by changes in circumstances. So, explaining the limitations could help users understand the reliability of the projections. This might be a key point to include in the report.\n\nOption D is about evaluating the hypothetical assumptions used to prepare the projection. While assumptions are crucial for projections, I'm not sure if the accountant compiling the projections is responsible for evaluating them. Maybe that's not their role; perhaps they just ensure that the projections are properly compiled based on the assumptions provided.\n\nLet me think again. The question is about what the accountant's report should include in a separate paragraph when compiling projected financial statements. Compiling projections usually involves assembling financial data based on certain assumptions provided by management. The accountant doesn't necessarily verify these assumptions but ensures that the projections are logically derived from them.\n\nGiven that, option A is about disclaiming assurance on historical statements, which might not be directly relevant to projections. Option B talks about limited assurance on the projections themselves, but projections are so uncertain that maybe limited assurance isn't the focus. Option C is about describing the limitations of the projections, which seems important because projections are based on assumptions and future events that are uncertain. Option D is about evaluating the assumptions, but I think the accountant compiling the projections relies on the assumptions provided without evaluating them.\n\nSo, between options, C seems the most appropriate. Describing the limitations on the usefulness of the projection would help users understand that projections are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. That kind of disclosure is crucial for anyone relying on the projections to make informed decisions.\n\nLet me check some standards to confirm. According to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), projected financial statements are prepared using the best estimates and assumptions available at the time, but they are still subject to change based on actual results. The AICPA's Statement on Standards for Specialized Services (SSSS) provides guidance on compiling projected financial information. It requires that the compilation report includes a disclaimer of opinion and emphasizes that the projections are based on assumptions provided by management.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, none of them exactly match a disclaimer of opinion. Option A mentions disclaiming any form of assurance on historical financial statements, but perhaps the focus should be on the projections themselves.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think differently. If the accountant is compiling projected financial statements, they are not auditing or reviewing them, so they wouldn't be providing any assurance\u2014neither positive nor negative\u2014on the projections. Therefore, a disclaimer of opinion might be appropriate to make it clear that no assurance is being provided.\n\nBut looking at option A, it's about historical financial statements, not the projections. So, perhaps the separate paragraph should disclaim assurance on the projections, not on the historical statements.\n\nLet me see. If I look up the AICPA's guidance, SSSS indicates that when compiling projected financial information, the accountant should issue a compilation report that includes a disclaimer of opinion regarding the projections. So, perhaps the separate paragraph should disclaim assurance on the projections themselves.\n\nBut none of the options directly say \"disclaims any assurance on the projected financial statements.\" Option A refers to historical financial statements, which isn't directly related to projections.\n\nOption B expresses limited assurance that the results will be within the projected range. That sounds more like a review report, not a compilation report. In a compilation, no assurance is provided, so expressing limited assurance would be inappropriate.\n\nOption C describes the limitations on the usefulness of the projection. This is important, but is it the primary content of the separate paragraph?\n\nOption D evaluates the hypothetical assumptions used to prepare the projection. Again, in a compilation, the accountant doesn't evaluate the assumptions; they assume that the projections are reasonably based on the assumptions provided by management.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the separate paragraph should include both a disclaimer of opinion and a description of the limitations.\n\nBut among the options, which one best captures what should be included in the separate paragraph?\n\nOption C seems the closest because describing the limitations on the usefulness of the projection is essential information that users need to understand the projections' reliability.\n\nSo, my answer would be option C: describes the limitations on the usefulness of the projection.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
