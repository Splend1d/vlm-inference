                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this problem about a randomized controlled trial comparing a new drug therapy to a standard one for treating hypertension. There are 140 women and 60 men, all between 30 and 60 years old, with high blood pressure. The study checks if the new drug, Drug X, is more effective than the standard therapy in reducing blood pressure to below 140/90 mm Hg.\n\nThe investigators set some probabilities: a 1% chance of wrongly concluding that Drug X is better when it's not (Type I error), and a 10% chance of wrongly concluding that the two drugs are equally effective when actually Drug X is better (Type II error). Now, they're asking for the statistical power of the study, and they provide options: 1%, 10%, 40%, or 90%.\n\nI need to figure out which of these is the correct statistical power based on the given information.\n\nFirst, I should recall what statistical power means. Statistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis. In other words, it's the ability of a test to detect an effect, if the effect actually exists. Power is calculated as 1 minus the beta error (\u03b2), where beta is the probability of a Type II error.\n\nSo, power = 1 - \u03b2.\n\nIn this context, the null hypothesis might be that there is no difference between Drug X and the standard therapy, and the alternative hypothesis is that Drug X is more effective.\n\nThe problem states that the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy when it's not (Type I error) is 1%. That sounds like the significance level \u03b1 = 0.01.\n\nIt also says the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same when actually Drug X is better (Type II error) is 10%, which is \u03b2 = 0.10.\n\nTherefore, the power should be 1 - \u03b2 = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 or 90%.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 1%\n\nB. 10%\n\nC. 40%\n\nD. 90%\n\nSo, according to this calculation, the answer should be D. 90%.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that I'm interpreting the problem correctly. Let's read it again.\n\n\"The investigators defined antihypertensive therapy as effective if the treatment resulted in a blood pressure measurement below 140/90 mm Hg. When designing the study, the investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy as 1%; they set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10%.\"\n\nSo, they set \u03b1 = 0.01 (chance of Type I error) and \u03b2 = 0.10 (chance of Type II error). Therefore, power should indeed be 1 - \u03b2 = 0.90 or 90%.\n\nBut let's think about it differently. Maybe there's some trick here.\n\nIs there any possibility that the power isn't simply 1 - \u03b2? Well, sometimes, \u03b2 can be confused with other error rates, but in this case, the problem seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the power is related to the ability to detect a difference when there is one, which aligns with 1 - \u03b2.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is D. 90%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
