                    "text": "So I need to find the area of the region in the first quadrant that's bounded by y = x\u00b2, y = cos(x), and the y-axis. Hmm, first quadrant means x is between 0 and \u03c0/2, right? Because in the first quadrant, both x and y are positive, and cos(x) is positive up to x = \u03c0/2.\n\nAlright, so I should find where these two curves intersect within that interval. So, set x\u00b2 = cos(x) and solve for x. That might be tricky. Maybe I can graph both functions to get an idea.\n\nLet me sketch y = x\u00b2 and y = cos(x). y = x\u00b2 starts at the origin and curves upward, while y = cos(x) starts at (0,1) and oscillates between 1 and -1. In the first quadrant, cos(x) decreases from 1 to 0 as x goes from 0 to \u03c0/2.\n\nLooking at the graphs, they seem to intersect somewhere between x = 0 and x = 1. Maybe around x = 0.8 or so. I can use this approximate value later for setting up the integral.\n\nNow, to find the area between these two curves from x = 0 to the intersection point, I need to integrate the top function minus the bottom function over that interval.\n\nBut first, I need to find the exact intersection point. Since solving x\u00b2 = cos(x) analytically is difficult, I'll estimate it numerically. Maybe use the Newton-Raphson method or just guess and check.\n\nLet me try plugging in x = 0.8 into both functions:\n\ncos(0.8) \u2248 0.6967\n\n0.8\u00b2 = 0.64\n\nSo, cos(0.8) \u2248 0.6967 > 0.64, so at x = 0.8, cos(x) > x\u00b2.\n\nLet's try x = 0.9:\n\ncos(0.9) \u2248 0.6216\n\n0.9\u00b2 = 0.81\n\nSo, cos(0.9) \u2248 0.6216 < 0.81, which means x\u00b2 > cos(x) here.\n\nTherefore, the intersection is between x = 0.8 and x = 0.9. Let's try x = 0.85:\n\ncos(0.85) \u2248 0.6693\n\n0.85\u00b2 = 0.7225\n\nSo, cos(0.85) \u2248 0.6693 < 0.7225, meaning x\u00b2 > cos(x) at x = 0.85.\n\nSo, it must be slightly less than x = 0.85. Let's try x = 0.84:\n\ncos(0.84) \u2248 0.6760\n\n0.84\u00b2 = 0.7056\n\nStill, cos(0.84) \u2248 0.6760 < 0.7056.\n\nAnd at x = 0.8:\n\ncos(0.8) \u2248 0.6967 > 0.64.\n\nSo, it's between x = 0.8 and x = 0.84. Let's try x = 0.82:\n\ncos(0.82) \u2248 0.6856\n\n0.82\u00b2 = 0.6724\n\nSo, cos(0.82) \u2248 0.6856 > 0.6724, meaning cos(x) > x\u00b2 here.\n\nTherefore, the intersection is between x = 0.82 and x = 0.84.\n\nThis is getting tedious. Maybe I should use a calculator to find the exact intersection point, but since I don't have one, I'll approximate it to x \u2248 0.86.\n\nSo, the area I need to find is from x = 0 to x \u2248 0.86, where cos(x) is above x\u00b2 on the graph.\n\nTherefore, the area A is the integral from 0 to 0.86 of [cos(x) - x\u00b2] dx.\n\nI can set up the integral as:\n\nA = \u222b from 0 to 0.86 (cos(x) - x\u00b2) dx\n\nNow, I need to evaluate this integral.\n\nFirst, find the antiderivative of (cos(x) - x\u00b2):\n\nAntiderivative of cos(x) is sin(x)\n\nAntiderivative of -x\u00b2 is - (1/3)x\u00b3\n\nSo, A = [sin(x) - (1/3)x\u00b3] from 0 to 0.86\n\nNow, plug in the limits:\n\nA = [sin(0.86) - (1/3)(0.86)\u00b3] - [sin(0) - (1/3)(0)\u00b3]\n\nCalculate sin(0.86):\n\nSin(0.86) \u2248 0.7431\n\nNow, (0.86)\u00b3 = 0.86 * 0.86 * 0.86 \u2248 0.6360\n\nSo, 1/3 * 0.6360 \u2248 0.2120\n\nTherefore, A \u2248 0.7431 - 0.2120 \u2248 0.5311\n\nBut looking back at the options, the closest one is C. 0.547, which is very close to my calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I should check with more decimal places for accuracy.\n\nLet me use x \u2248 0.860, and calculate more precisely.\n\nFirst, find the exact intersection point.\n\nSet x\u00b2 = cos(x)\n\nLet f(x) = x\u00b2 - cos(x)\n\nFind x such that f(x) = 0.\n\nUsing Newton's method:\n\nx\u2081 = x\u2080 - f(x\u2080)/f'(x\u2080)\n\nf'(x) = 2x + sin(x)\n\nStart with x\u2080 = 0.85\n\nf(0.85) = 0.7225 - 0.6760 = 0.0465\n\nf'(0.85) = 2*0.85 + sin(0.85) \u2248 1.7 + 0.7174 \u2248 2.4174\n\nx\u2081 = 0.85 - 0.0465 / 2.4174 \u2248 0.85 - 0.0192 \u2248 0.8308\n\nRepeat:\n\nf(0.8308) = 0.8308\u00b2 - cos(0.8308) \u2248 0.6899 - 0.6710 = 0.0189\n\nf'(0.8308) \u2248 2*0.8308 + sin(0.8308) \u2248 1.6616 + 0.7044 \u2248 2.3660\n\nx\u2082 = 0.8308 - 0.0189 / 2.3660 \u2248 0.8308 - 0.0079 \u2248 0.8229\n\nRepeat again:\n\nf(0.8229) = 0.8229\u00b2 - cos(0.8229) \u2248 0.6770 - 0.6740 = 0.0030\n\nf'(0.8229) \u2248 2*0.8229 + sin(0.8229) \u2248 1.6458 + 0.7044 \u2248 2.3502\n\nx\u2083 = 0.8229 - 0.0030 / 2.3502 \u2248 0.8229 - 0.0013 \u2248 0.8216\n\nThis is converging to x \u2248 0.8216\n\nNow, compute the integral from 0 to 0.8216 of (cos(x) - x\u00b2) dx\n\nAntiderivative is sin(x) - (1/3)x\u00b3\n\nEvaluate at x = 0.8216 and x = 0:\n\nSin(0.8216) \u2248 0.7229\n\n(1/3)(0.8216)^3 \u2248 (1/3)(0.5502) \u2248 0.1834\n\nSo, A \u2248 0.7229 - 0.1834 \u2248 0.5395\n\nThis is closer to 0.54, which corresponds to option C. 0.547.\n\nTherefore, the area is approximately 0.547.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.547} \\]"
