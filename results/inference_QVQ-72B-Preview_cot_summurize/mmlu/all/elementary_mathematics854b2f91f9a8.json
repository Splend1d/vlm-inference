                    "text": "So I've got this equation here: 14 = w + 23. And I need to solve for w. Let me see what options I have. There are four choices: A. -37, B. -9, C. 9, D. 37. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these is correct.\n\nFirst, I should recall the basic algebra for solving equations. I need to isolate the variable w. So, in the equation 14 = w + 23, w is on one side with 23 added to it. To find w, I should subtract 23 from both sides of the equation.\n\nLet me try that:\n\n14 = w + 23\n\nSubtract 23 from both sides:\n\n14 - 23 = w + 23 - 23\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-9 = w\n\nSo, w equals -9.\n\nLooking back at the options, that's choice B. But wait, let me double-check because I want to make sure I'm not making a mistake.\n\nMaybe I should try another approach. Perhaps I can subtract 14 from both sides instead of subtracting 23. Let's see what happens.\n\n14 = w + 23\n\nSubtract 14 from both sides:\n\n14 - 14 = w + 23 - 14\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n0 = w + 9\n\nThen, subtract 9 from both sides:\n\n0 - 9 = w + 9 - 9\n\nSo, -9 = w\n\nOkay, I get the same answer again. It seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider using subtraction properties. Since addition is involved, maybe I can think about directly subtracting 23 from 14 to find w.\n\n14 - 23 = w\n\nCalculating that: 14 minus 23 is -9. So again, w = -9.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can plug in each option to see which one satisfies the original equation.\n\nOption A: -37\n\nIf w = -37, then w + 23 = -37 + 23 = -14. Does -14 equal 14? No.\n\nOption B: -9\n\nIf w = -9, then w + 23 = -9 + 23 = 14. Yes, that matches the right side of the equation.\n\nOption C: 9\n\nIf w = 9, then w + 23 = 9 + 23 = 32. Does 32 equal 14? No.\n\nOption D: 37\n\nIf w = 37, then w + 23 = 37 + 23 = 60. Does 60 equal 14? No.\n\nSo, clearly, the only option that works is B. -9.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any other way to interpret the equation or if there's a trick here. But it seems straightforward: just solve for w in 14 = w + 23.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the equation is supposed to be read differently, like w + 23 = 14, but no, it's written as 14 = w + 23, which is the same thing.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The answer should be B. -9.\n\nJust to make sure, let me go through the steps one more time.\n\nOriginal equation: 14 = w + 23\n\nSubtract 23 from both sides: 14 - 23 = w + 23 - 23\n\nSimplify: -9 = w\n\nTherefore, w = -9.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-9} \\]"
