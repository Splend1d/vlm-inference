                    "text": "So I need to divide 1,248 by 7 and find out which of these options is correct. I'm a bit rusty on division, but I think I can figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what division means. Dividing a number by another number tells me how many times one number fits into another. So, 1,248 divided by 7 means how many times 7 fits into 1,248.\n\nI remember that division can be done using long division, so maybe I should set it up that way. Let's see:\n\n1,248 \u00f7 7.\n\nI'll write it like this:\n\n```\n\n7 | 1,248\n\n```\n\nNow, I need to look at the dividend (1,248) and the divisor (7). I'll start from the leftmost digit of the dividend. The first digit is 1, and 7 is larger than 1, so I can't divide 7 into 1. So, I'll take the first two digits: 12.\n\nNow, I need to figure out how many times 7 goes into 12. 7 times 1 is 7, which is less than 12. 7 times 2 is 14, which is larger than 12. So, 7 goes into 12 once.\n\nI'll write 1 above the line, above the second digit, and then subtract 7 from 12 to get 5. Bring down the next digit, which is 4, to make it 54.\n\nNow, I need to see how many times 7 goes into 54. 7 times 7 is 49, which is less than 54. 7 times 8 is 56, which is larger than 54. So, 7 goes into 54 seven times.\n\nWrite 7 above the line, and subtract 49 from 54 to get 5. Bring down the next digit, which is 8, to make it 58.\n\nNow, how many times does 7 go into 58? 7 times 8 is 56, which is less than 58. 7 times 9 is 63, which is larger than 58. So, 7 goes into 58 eight times.\n\nWrite 8 above the line, and subtract 56 from 58 to get 2. Since there are no more digits to bring down, the remainder is 2.\n\nSo, the quotient is 178 with a remainder of 2.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 177 remainder 9\n\nB. 168 remainder 2\n\nC. 178 remainder 2\n\nD. 178 remainder 3\n\nMy answer matches option C: 178 remainder 2.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I can use another method to confirm. Perhaps multiplication.\n\nI know that division is the inverse of multiplication. So, if I take the quotient and multiply it by the divisor and add the remainder, I should get the original dividend.\n\nSo, 178 \u00d7 7 + 2 should equal 1,248.\n\nLet's calculate 178 \u00d7 7:\n\n100 \u00d7 7 = 700\n\n70 \u00d7 7 = 490\n\n8 \u00d7 7 = 56\n\nAdding them up: 700 + 490 = 1,190 + 56 = 1,246\n\nThen, 1,246 + 2 = 1,248, which matches the original number. So, my answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's check option D: 178 remainder 3.\n\n178 \u00d7 7 = 1,246 + 3 = 1,249, which is not equal to 1,248.\n\nOption C: 178 remainder 2: 1,246 + 2 = 1,248, which is correct.\n\nOption B: 168 remainder 2: 168 \u00d7 7 = ?\n\nLet me calculate 168 \u00d7 7:\n\n100 \u00d7 7 = 700\n\n60 \u00d7 7 = 420\n\n8 \u00d7 7 = 56\n\nTotal: 700 + 420 = 1,120 + 56 = 1,176 + 2 = 1,178, which is not 1,248.\n\nOption A: 177 remainder 9: 177 \u00d7 7 + 9.\n\n177 \u00d7 7:\n\n100 \u00d7 7 = 700\n\n70 \u00d7 7 = 490\n\n7 \u00d7 7 = 49\n\nTotal: 700 + 490 = 1,190 + 49 = 1,239 + 9 = 1,248, which is correct.\n\nWait a minute, both option C and option A seem to give 1,248, but according to my earlier long division, the remainder should be 2, not 9.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in my long division.\n\nLet me try the long division again.\n\nStarting with 1,248 \u00f7 7.\n\nFirst, divide 12 by 7: 7 goes into 12 once, remainder 5.\n\nThen, bring down 4 to make it 54. 7 goes into 54 seven times, remainder 5.\n\nBring down 8 to make it 58. 7 goes into 58 eight times, remainder 2.\n\nSo, quotient is 178 with remainder 2.\n\nBut according to option A, it's 177 with remainder 9. That would mean that 177 \u00d7 7 + 9 = 1,248.\n\nLet me check 177 \u00d7 7:\n\n177 \u00d7 7 = 1,239 + 9 = 1,248.\n\nWait, that also gives 1,248.\n\nSo, both 178 \u00d7 7 + 2 and 177 \u00d7 7 + 9 equal 1,248.\n\nBut mathematically, in division, the remainder should be less than the divisor.\n\nSince the divisor is 7, the remainder should be less than 7.\n\nIn option A, the remainder is 9, which is greater than 7, so that's invalid.\n\nTherefore, the correct quotient is 178 with remainder 2, which is option C.\n\nI think the confusion came from not considering that the remainder must be less than the divisor.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C: 178 remainder 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
