Let's expand both sides to see if that helps.\n\nSo, (ab)^2 means ab multiplied by itself again, so (ab)(ab). And a^2 b^2 is a*a * b*b. So, the equation is (ab)(ab) = a^2 b^2.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n(ab)(ab) = a^2 b^2.\n\nI can multiply out the left side: abab.\n\nSo, abab = aabb.\n\nHmm, maybe I can cancel some terms to see if there's a relationship between a and b.\n\nLet's try to left-multiply both sides by a^{-1} to see what happens.\n\na^{-1} (abab) = a^{-1} (aabb).\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n(bab) = (abb).\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can rearrange the equation to see if it implies commutativity.\n\nStarting again with (ab)^2 = a^2 b^2, which is abab = aabb.\n\nIf I multiply both sides on the right by a^{-1} b^{-1}, that might help.\n\nSo, abab a^{-1} b^{-1} = aabb a^{-1} b^{-1}.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\na (ba) b a^{-1} b^{-1} = a (bb) a^{-1} b^{-1}.\n\nWait, maybe that's not the best way. Let me try to rearrange it differently.\n\nStarting from abab = aabb.\n\nLet me multiply both sides on the left by a^{-1} and on the right by b^{-1}.\n\na^{-1} abab b^{-1} = a^{-1} aabb b^{-1}.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nbab b^{-1} = abb b^{-1}.\n\nWhich is:\n\nba = ab.\n\nOh! So, ba = ab. That means that for any a and b in G, ab = ba. That is, the group is abelian.\n\nSo, if (ab)^2 = a^2 b^2 for all a, b in G, then G is abelian.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. abelian.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are any other implications. Maybe it's also finite, cyclic, or of order two?\n\nWell, being abelian doesn't necessarily imply that the group is finite, cyclic, or of order two. There are infinite abelian groups, like the integers under addition, and groups of other orders that are abelian but not of order two.\n\nSo, A. finite - not necessarily.\n\nB. cyclic - not necessarily.\n\nC. of order two - not necessarily.\n\nD. abelian - yes, necessarily.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. abelian.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
