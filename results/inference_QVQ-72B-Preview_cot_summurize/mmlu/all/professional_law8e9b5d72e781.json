                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a landowner who bought a three-acre tract of land in 2005 and took out a $100,000 mortgage from a bank to finance it. The mortgage was recorded right away. Then, in 2006, the landowner subdivided the property into three one-acre lots and sold Lot 1 to a friend for $75,000 and Lot 2 to his brother for $60,000 the next year. He kept Lot 3 and lived there. The deeds for Lots 1 and 2 didn't mention the original mortgage to the bank. Now, in 2009, the landowner lost his job and stopped making mortgage payments, so the bank is about to foreclose.\n\nThe question is, what are the rights and obligations of the parties involved? Specifically, which of the options A through D accurately describes the situation.\n\nLet me start by understanding the recording statute in this jurisdiction. It says: \"Any unrecorded conveyance or mortgage is invalid as against a subsequent bona fide purchaser for value without notice who records first.\" So, basically, if someone buys property without knowing about an existing mortgage and records their purchase first, that existing unrecorded mortgage is invalid against them.\n\nIn this case, the original mortgage was recorded in 2005 when the landowner borrowed the money from the bank. So, the mortgage was on the entire three-acre tract.\n\nIn 2006, the landowner sold Lot 1 to his friend for $75,000, and in 2007, he sold Lot 2 to his brother for $60,000. The deeds for these sales didn't mention the original mortgage. So, the question is whether the friend and the brother are responsible for the mortgage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the friend and the brother are bona fide purchasers for value without notice of the mortgage.\n\nA bona fide purchaser is someone who buys property in good faith, without knowledge of any defects or prior claims, and pays valuable consideration for it.\n\nIn this scenario, the friend bought Lot 1 in 2006 and the brother bought Lot 2 in 2007. The original mortgage was recorded in 2005, so it should be part of the public record.\n\nIf the friend and the brother did a title search before buying the lots, they should have found the mortgage. Assuming they did a proper title search, they would have known about the mortgage unless the landowner somehow concealed it or the recording was faulty, which isn't indicated here.\n\nHowever, the deeds didn't mention the mortgage, which might suggest that the landowner didn't disclose it, but since it was recorded, it should still be visible in the public records.\n\nAssuming they knew about the mortgage, they might still be liable for it unless they took steps to protect themselves, like getting a release of the mortgage lien or having the landowner pay off the mortgage before selling.\n\nBut the question states that the deeds didn't mention the mortgage, which might imply that the landowner didn't pay off the mortgage or get it released before selling.\n\nSo, if the friend and the brother knew about the mortgage but proceeded to buy the lots without ensuring the mortgage was satisfied or subordinated, they might still be subject to the mortgage.\n\nHowever, in many jurisdictions, when a property is sold, the mortgage typically remains attached to the property unless specifically paid off or released.\n\nBut, there's also the concept of a \"purchase money mortgage,\" where the mortgage is taken out to buy the property, but that might not apply here since the original mortgage was from 2005, and the sales were in 2006 and 2007.\n\nWait, the original mortgage was to buy the entire three-acre tract in 2005, and then parts of it were sold in 2006 and 2007.\n\nSo, the mortgage was on the entire property, but parts of it were sold afterward.\n\nIn such a case, unless the mortgage was divided or the liens were released for the sold lots, the mortgage would still attach to the entire original property, including the sold lots.\n\nBut, in practice, when a property is subdivided and parts are sold, often the mortgage is either paid off, subordinated, or the liens are allocated to the remaining property.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, it seems that the mortgage was not addressed in the sales of Lots 1 and 2.\n\nSo, the bank's mortgage likely still applies to all three lots unless there's some agreement to the contrary.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. The bank can foreclose only on Lot 3 because ownership of that parcel is retained by the landowner, the original mortgagor.\n\nThis seems plausible because the landowner still owns Lot 3, and the mortgage was on the entire property. However, mortgages typically secure the debt against the entire property, and subdividing the property doesn't necessarily release the sold portions from the mortgage lien unless specifically provided in the mortgage terms or by subsequent agreements.\n\nBut, in many jurisdictions, if the property is subdivided and parts are sold without paying off the mortgage, the mortgage lien remains on the entire property, and the bank can foreclose on the entire property to satisfy the debt.\n\nSo, option A might not be accurate.\n\nB. The bank has the option of foreclosing on parcels 1, 2, or 3 because the mortgage covered the entire three-acre tract.\n\nThis seems more accurate. Since the original mortgage was on the entire three-acre tract, and the property was later subdivided without paying off the mortgage or getting a release for the sold lots, the mortgage lien likely still attaches to all three lots.\n\nTherefore, the bank can foreclose on any or all of the lots to satisfy the debt.\n\nC. The bank must first foreclose on Lot 3, and if the proceeds are insufficient, then the mortgagee may foreclose against Lots 1 and 2 in the inverse order of their alienation.\n\nThis option suggests that the bank has to foreclose on Lot 3 first and only then can go after Lots 1 and 2, and in reverse order of when they were sold.\n\nI'm not sure about this. I don't recall any specific rule that requires foreclosing on the remaining property first and then on sold properties in inverse order.\n\nThis seems like it might be based on some doctrine of partial releases or something, but I don't think that's generally the case.\n\nUnless there's a specific agreement or local law that dictates this, I think option B is more accurate.\n\nD. The bank can foreclose on Lot 3, but not on Lots 1 and 2 unless the friend and the brother assumed the mortgage when they purchased their land from the landowner.\n\nThis option suggests that the bank can only foreclose on Lot 3, unless the buyers (friend and brother) assumed the mortgage when they bought Lots 1 and 2.\n\nAssuming isn't mentioned in the scenario. The deeds didn't mention the mortgage, so it's unclear if there was any assumption agreement.\n\nGenerally, if a property is sold with an existing mortgage and the buyer doesn't assume the mortgage or agree to pay it, the original borrower remains liable for the debt.\n\nHowever, the mortgage lien still attaches to the property, so the bank can still foreclose on the property to satisfy the debt, regardless of whether the buyer assumed it or not.\n\nSo, unless there's an assumption agreement in place, the bank can still foreclose on Lots 1 and 2, even if the friend and brother didn't assume the mortgage.\n\nTherefore, option D seems incomplete or incorrect.\n\nGiven this analysis, I think option B is the most accurate: the bank can foreclose on any or all of the lots because the mortgage covered the entire three-acre tract, and subdividing the property without addressing the mortgage doesn't release the sold lots from the mortgage lien.\n\nSo, the answer is B."
