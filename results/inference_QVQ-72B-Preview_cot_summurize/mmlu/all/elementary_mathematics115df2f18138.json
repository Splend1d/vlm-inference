                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about hikers climbing from a place called Salt Flats up to Talon Bluff. The elevation of Salt Flats is -55 feet, and Talon Bluff is at 620 feet. I need to find the difference in elevation between these two points. The options are A. 565 feet, B. 575 feet, C. 665 feet, and D. 675 feet.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what elevation means. Elevation is basically how high something is above sea level. Negative elevation would mean it's below sea level. So, Salt Flats is 55 feet below sea level, and Talon Bluff is 620 feet above sea level.\n\nTo find the difference between these two points, I should subtract the elevation of Salt Flats from the elevation of Talon Bluff. That is, 620 minus (-55). Hmm, subtracting a negative should be the same as adding the positive, right? So, 620 - (-55) would be the same as 620 + 55.\n\nLet me calculate that: 620 plus 55. 620 plus 50 is 670, and then plus another 5 would make it 675 feet.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should visualize a number line. Starting at -55 and going up to 620. The distance from -55 to 0 is 55 feet, and from 0 to 620 is another 620 feet. So total, that's 55 + 620 = 675 feet.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the absolute difference between these two elevations. Since both are positive distances from sea level, but one is negative because it's below sea level, I need to account for that.\n\nSo, the difference in elevation is 620 - (-55) = 675 feet.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using the concept of absolute value. The absolute difference between two elevations is the absolute value of their difference. So, |620 - (-55)| = |620 + 55| = |675| = 675 feet.\n\nAlso, I can think about the change in elevation. If I'm climbing from -55 feet to 620 feet, the total climb would be from -55 to 0, which is 55 feet up to sea level, and then from 0 to 620, which is another 620 feet. So, total climb is 55 + 620 = 675 feet.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the depth below sea level and the height above sea level separately. The depth from sea level to Salt Flats is 55 feet, and the height from sea level to Talon Bluff is 620 feet. So, the total vertical distance between them would be the sum of these two distances: 55 + 620 = 675 feet.\n\nI think I'm consistent in getting 675 feet as the difference in elevation. Let me check the options again: A. 565 feet, B. 575 feet, C. 665 feet, D. 675 feet.\n\nIt seems like option D is 675 feet, which matches my calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect the elevation difference. For example, the path the hikers took\u2014was it a straight climb or was there some undulation? But no, the problem states that they climbed from Salt Flats to Talon Bluff, so I assume it's a direct climb from one point to another.\n\nAlso, I should consider if the elevations are precise or if there's any margin of error, but the problem presents them as exact values.\n\nLet me consider if there's a possible misinterpretation of the elevations. Salt Flats is at -55 feet, which means it's 55 feet below sea level, and Talon Bluff is at 620 feet, which is 620 feet above sea level. The difference between them is indeed from -55 to 620, which is a total span of 675 feet.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and each time I arrive at the same answer: 675 feet.\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. 675 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
