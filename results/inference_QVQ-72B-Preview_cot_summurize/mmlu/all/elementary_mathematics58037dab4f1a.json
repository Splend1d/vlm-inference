                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: a water tank can hold 50 gallons, and I need to figure out what flow rate, in gallons per second, is required to fill it in 20 seconds. The options are A. 0.4, B. 2.5, C. 16.7, and D. 70.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what a flow rate is. Flow rate is basically how much liquid moves through something per unit of time. So, if I have a pipe or a hose, the flow rate would tell me how many gallons come out every second, minute, hour, etc.\n\nIn this case, I need the flow rate in gallons per second, and I know that the tank can hold 50 gallons, and I want to fill it in 20 seconds. So, intuitively, I think if I divide the total gallons by the total seconds, I should get the flow rate per second.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal gallons = 50\n\nTotal seconds = 20\n\nFlow rate = total gallons / total seconds = 50 / 20 = 2.5 gallons per second.\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check because I don't want to miss anything.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using units to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nI know that flow rate is often expressed as volume over time, which in this case is gallons per second. So, yeah, dividing 50 gallons by 20 seconds gives me 2.5 gallons per second.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider? Like, is the tank being filled continuously, or is there some variation in the flow?\n\nThe problem seems to suggest that the tank is being filled in exactly 20 seconds, so I assume the flow rate is constant throughout those 20 seconds.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about the units again. If flow rate is gallons per second, and time is seconds, then multiplying flow rate by time should give the total gallons.\n\nSo, if flow rate is 2.5 gallons/second * 20 seconds = 50 gallons, which matches the tank's capacity. That checks out.\n\nLet me see if any of the other options make sense. Option A is 0.4 gallons per second. If I multiply 0.4 by 20, I get 8 gallons, which is less than 50, so that can't be right.\n\nOption C is 16.7 gallons per second. 16.7 * 20 would be 334 gallons, which is way more than the tank can hold. So that doesn't fit.\n\nOption D is 70 gallons per second. That would fill the tank in less than a second, which contradicts the given time of 20 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the only option that makes sense is B. 2.5 gallons per second.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a trick here. Maybe the flow rate isn't constant, or perhaps there's some loss due to evaporation or something, but the problem doesn't mention any of that.\n\nAssuming the flow rate is constant and there are no leaks or other issues, the calculation should be straightforward: 50 gallons divided by 20 seconds equals 2.5 gallons per second.\n\nLet me consider if there's a different approach, perhaps using units conversion or something, but I don't think it's necessary here since the units are consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of filling rates. If I have a constant flow rate, and I want to fill a certain volume in a certain time, the flow rate should indeed be volume over time.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The answer should simply be 2.5 gallons per second.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider the definition of flow rate again. Flow rate is the volume of fluid that passes through a given cross-sectional area per unit time. In this context, it's the volume of water entering the tank per second.\n\nSo, if the tank is being filled at a constant rate, the flow rate should be the total volume divided by the total time, which is 50 gallons divided by 20 seconds, equaling 2.5 gallons per second.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B. 2.5 gallons per second.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
