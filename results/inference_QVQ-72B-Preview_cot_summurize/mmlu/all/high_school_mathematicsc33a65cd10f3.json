                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: an 8.5-by-11-inch piece of paper is folded in half repeatedly, each time shortening what was then the longer side. I need to find the length of the longest side immediately after the second fold, and the answer should be to the nearest tenth of an inch.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening when I fold the paper in half, shortening the longer side each time. So, starting with an 8.5 by 11-inch piece, the longer side is 11 inches. When I fold it in half, I'm folding it along the direction that makes the longer side shorter.\n\nWait, let's think carefully. If I have an 8.5 by 11-inch rectangle, and I fold it in half shortening the longer side, which is 11 inches, that means I'm folding it along the 8.5-inch side to make the 11-inch side shorter.\n\nSo, after the first fold, the new dimensions should be such that the original 11-inch side is now halved because it was folded in half. So, the new longer side would be the original shorter side, which is 8.5 inches, and the shorter side would be half of 11 inches, which is 5.5 inches.\n\nSo, after the first fold, the dimensions are 8.5 inches and 5.5 inches. Now, the longer side is 8.5 inches.\n\nFor the second fold, I need to fold it again, shortening the longer side, which is now 8.5 inches. So, I'll fold it along the direction that makes the 8.5-inch side shorter.\n\nThat means I'll be folding it along the 5.5-inch side to halve the 8.5-inch side.\n\nWait, no. Actually, to shorten the longer side, which is 8.5 inches, I need to fold it in half, making that side half of 8.5 inches.\n\nSo, half of 8.5 inches is 4.25 inches. So, the new longer side would be half of the original 8.5 inches, which is 4.25 inches, and the shorter side remains 5.5 inches.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because if I fold it along the 5.5-inch side to make the 8.5-inch side shorter, then the new dimensions should be half of 8.5 inches by 5.5 inches.\n\nBut, actually, when you fold a rectangle along its longer side to halve it, the new dimensions depend on which way you fold it.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nStarting with an 8.5 by 11-inch rectangle.\n\nFirst fold: shorten the longer side, which is 11 inches.\n\nSo, if I fold it along the 8.5-inch side to make the 11-inch side shorter, that means I'm folding it widthwise, making the height shorter.\n\nWait, no. If I fold it along the 8.5-inch side, I'm folding it horizontally, so the new height would be half of 11 inches, which is 5.5 inches, and the width remains 8.5 inches.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, after the first fold, the dimensions are 8.5 inches by 5.5 inches.\n\nNow, for the second fold, I need to shorten the longer side again, which is now 8.5 inches.\n\nSo, I'll fold it along the 5.5-inch side to make the 8.5-inch side shorter.\n\nThat means I'm folding it vertically, making the width half of 8.5 inches, which is 4.25 inches, and the height remains 5.5 inches.\n\nTherefore, after the second fold, the dimensions are 4.25 inches by 5.5 inches.\n\nThe question asks for the length of the longest side immediately after the second fold, which would be 5.5 inches.\n\nBut wait, 5.5 is already to the nearest tenth, right? So, the answer should be 5.5 inches.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 4.5\n\nB. 1\n\nC. 5.5\n\nD. 5\n\nSo, the correct choice is C. 5.5.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with an 8.5 by 11-inch rectangle.\n\nFirst fold: shorten the longer side, which is 11 inches, by folding along the shorter side (8.5 inches). So, folding the paper along the 8.5-inch side will make the 11-inch side become half, which is 5.5 inches, and the 8.5-inch side remains as is.\n\nSo, after the first fold, the dimensions are 8.5 inches by 5.5 inches.\n\nSecond fold: shorten the longer side, which is now 8.5 inches, by folding along the shorter side (5.5 inches). So, folding along the 5.5-inch side will make the 8.5-inch side become half, which is 4.25 inches, and the 5.5-inch side remains as is.\n\nTherefore, after the second fold, the dimensions are 4.25 inches by 5.5 inches.\n\nThe longest side is 5.5 inches, which corresponds to option C.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5.5} \\]"
