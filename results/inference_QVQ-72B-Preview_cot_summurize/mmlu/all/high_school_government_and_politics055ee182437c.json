                    "text": "So I have this question about devolution, and I need to pick an example of it from the options provided. Devolution is when the central government gives more power or responsibility to the local or regional governments, right? So, in this context, it's about the federal government allowing states to have more say or control over certain policies.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Allowing states to decide how to meet federally mandated greenhouse gas emissions targets.\n\nSo, here, there's a federal mandate that sets the goals for greenhouse gas emissions, but the states get to choose how they achieve those targets. That seems like the federal government is setting the rules but letting the states figure out the best way to comply based on their individual circumstances. That could be seen as a form of devolution because it's giving states more autonomy in how they implement policies to meet the federal standards.\n\nOption B: A \"race to the bottom\" in which states compete with one another to have the fewest environmental regulations.\n\nThis seems different. It's not about the federal government giving power to the states; it's about states competing to have less regulation, possibly to attract businesses by having lower operating costs. This might lead to a situation where environmental standards are lowered across the board as states try to outdo each other. This doesn't sound like devolution in the sense of the federal government granting powers to the states. It's more about states choosing to reduce their own regulations, perhaps in the absence of strong federal mandates.\n\nOption C: A state that legalizes marijuana possession in conflict with federal law.\n\nThis is interesting. Here, a state is choosing to allow something that's still illegal under federal law. This is more about states asserting their rights to make their own laws, even when they conflict with federal regulations. It's not necessarily about the federal government devolving power to the states; it's about states exercising their sovereignty in areas where federal law doesn't allow it.\n\nOption D: A state being prevented from implementing a fuel efficiency standard that is more stringent than that set by the federal government.\n\nThis seems like the opposite of devolution. If the federal government is preventing a state from having higher fuel efficiency standards, that suggests that the federal government is limiting the state's ability to set its own policies in this area. This would be an example of the federal government asserting its authority over the states, not giving them more power.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, Option A seems to be the best example of devolution. The federal government is setting a goal but allowing states to decide how to reach it, which gives states more autonomy and decision-making power in implementing environmental policies.\n\nWait a minute, but Option C also seems like a case where a state is making its own decisions, even if it conflicts with federal law. Could that also be considered devolution?\n\nWell, devolution is typically about the federal government formally transferring powers to the states through constitutional or legislative changes. In Option C, the state is acting independently without explicit authorization from the federal government. So, while it's an example of states exercising their own authority, it's not necessarily an example of devolution in the strict sense.\n\nIn contrast, Option A seems to involve a deliberate decision by the federal government to allow states flexibility in achieving federal objectives, which aligns more closely with the concept of devolution.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is Option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
