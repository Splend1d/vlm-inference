                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this excerpt from a historian's work about housing in Poplar during the inter-war years. It's talking about Addison's Act and how it was conceived out of fear that if working-class aspirations weren't met after World War I, Britain might have a revolution similar to Russia's. But by 1920, that fear was fading, and Addison's policy was seen as too expensive. Then, there's mention of the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme, which was approved in September 1920 but then deferred by the Government's Housing Board. In 1921, the government announced a big cutback in the housing program, reducing the housing target by half.\n\nSo, the question is asking for the best description of the plans being changed above. The options are:\n\nA. Welfare programs were questioned after the First World War.\n\nB. Housing was a large part of the British budget.\n\nC. Workers were threatening communist revolution.\n\nD. The government Housing Board wanted to build more houses.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, the excerpt mentions that Addison's Act was conceived out of fear of a potential revolution similar to Russia's if working-class aspirations weren't met after the war. But by 1920, that fear was receding, and Addison's policy was seen as extravagant. So, it seems like the initial driver for the housing program (fear of revolution) was diminishing, and there was a shift in perception about the policy's cost.\n\nThen, the Kingfield Street scheme was approved but then deferred by the Housing Board, and eventually, in 1921, the government announced a drastic curtailment of the housing program, cutting the housing target by half.\n\nSo, the plans were being scaled back significantly.\n\nLooking at option A: \"Welfare programs were questioned after the First World War.\"\n\nThis seems relevant because the housing program was part of welfare initiatives to address working-class needs post-war. The fact that the policy was seen as extravagant suggests that there was indeed questioning or criticism of these welfare programs.\n\nOption B: \"Housing was a large part of the British budget.\"\n\nWell, the excerpt does mention that Addison's policy was seen as extravagant, and that the government cut the housing target by half, which implies that housing was a significant part of the budget. However, the focus seems more on the policy changes due to changing perceptions and fears rather than just the size of the budget allocation.\n\nOption C: \"Workers were threatening communist revolution.\"\n\nThe excerpt says that the initial fear of such a revolution was receding by 1920, which suggests that by that time, the threat was perceived as less imminent, not that workers were actively threatening revolution at that point.\n\nOption D: \"The government Housing Board wanted to build more houses.\"\n\nThis contradicts the information in the excerpt. The Housing Board deferred the Kingfield Street scheme and the government announced a cutback in the housing program, so they were actually reducing, not increasing, housing construction.\n\nGiven these considerations, option A seems the most accurate description of what's happening in the excerpt. The welfare programs, including housing, were being questioned after the war, leading to changes in policy and reductions in the housing targets.\n\nI think the best answer is A.\n\nJust to make sure, let's double-check the other options.\n\nOption B: While housing was a part of the budget and was seen as expensive, the primary driver for the policy change seems to be the diminishing fear of revolution and the questioning of the policy's necessity rather than just its budgetary impact.\n\nOption C: The excerpt indicates that the fear of revolution was receding by 1920, so it's not accurate to say that workers were threatening communist revolution at that time.\n\nOption D: Clearly, the actions of the Housing Board and the government were to reduce housing construction, not to increase it, so this option is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best description is indeed option A: welfare programs were questioned after the First World War.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
