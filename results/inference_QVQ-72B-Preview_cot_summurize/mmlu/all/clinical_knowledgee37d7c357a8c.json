                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a person who weighs 65 kilograms, and they're being prescribed dopamine at a rate of 4 micrograms per kilogram per minute. We need to find out how many milligrams of dopamine they will receive in one hour. The options are quite spread out, so I need to be careful with my units and conversions.\n\nFirst, let's understand the prescription rate: 4 micrograms/kg/min. That means for every kilogram of body weight, the person gets 4 micrograms of dopamine per minute.\n\nSo, for a 65 kg person, the rate would be 4 micrograms/kg/min multiplied by 65 kg. Let's calculate that:\n\n4 micrograms/kg/min \u00d7 65 kg = 260 micrograms/min\n\nAlright, so that's 260 micrograms per minute. But the question asks for the total amount they receive in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we need to find out how much dopamine is given over 60 minutes.\n\nTotal dopamine = rate \u00d7 time\n\n= 260 micrograms/min \u00d7 60 min\n\n= 15,600 micrograms\n\nOkay, so 15,600 micrograms in an hour. But looking at the options, there's 15600 mg, but wait, that's in milligrams, not micrograms. I need to make sure I have the correct units.\n\nMicrograms are very small units. There are 1,000,000 micrograms in a milligram. So, to convert micrograms to milligrams, I need to divide by 1,000,000.\n\nSo, 15,600 micrograms \u00f7 1,000,000 = 0.0156 milligrams.\n\nHmm, but that doesn't match any of the options directly. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's re-examine the units.\n\nThe prescription is 4 micrograms/kg/min.\n\nFor a 65 kg person, it's 4 \u00d7 65 = 260 micrograms/min.\n\nOver 60 minutes, that's 260 \u00d7 60 = 15,600 micrograms.\n\nNow, converting micrograms to milligrams:\n\n1 milligram = 1,000 micrograms.\n\nSo, 15,600 micrograms \u00f7 1,000 = 15.6 milligrams.\n\nWait, that seems better. Maybe I misread the options earlier.\n\nLet me list the options again:\n\nA. 156\n\nB. 15.6\n\nC. 1.56\n\nD. 15600\n\nSo, according to my calculation, it should be 15.6 milligrams, which is option B.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting over:\n\nPrescription rate: 4 micrograms/kg/min\n\nPatient weight: 65 kg\n\nTime: 1 hour = 60 minutes\n\nFirst, calculate the patient's dose per minute:\n\n4 micrograms/kg/min \u00d7 65 kg = 260 micrograms/min\n\nThen, total dose in 60 minutes:\n\n260 micrograms/min \u00d7 60 min = 15,600 micrograms\n\nNow, convert to milligrams:\n\n15,600 micrograms \u00f7 1,000 = 15.6 milligrams\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the units in terms of kilograms and hours directly.\n\nFirst, convert the rate to milligrams per kilogram per minute:\n\nSince 1 milligram = 1,000 micrograms, 4 micrograms = 0.004 milligrams.\n\nSo, the rate is 0.004 milligrams/kg/min.\n\nFor a 65 kg person, that's 0.004 \u00d7 65 = 0.26 milligrams/min\n\nOver 60 minutes, that's 0.26 \u00d7 60 = 15.6 milligrams\n\nAgain, the same result: 15.6 milligrams.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. 15.6\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this calculation.\n\nIs the dopamine administered continuously over the hour? Assuming yes, unless specified otherwise.\n\nAre there any losses or metabolic changes? No, the problem seems straightforward.\n\nAlso, checking the units:\n\nMicrograms to milligrams: 1,000 micrograms = 1 milligram\n\nSo, 15,600 micrograms = 15.6 milligrams\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 15.6 milligrams.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
