                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a car starting from rest and accelerating uniformly in a straight line at 5 meters per second squared, and I need to find out how long it takes to cover 200 meters. The options are a few different times, but I want to figure it out step by step to make sure I understand what's going on.\n\nFirst off, I know that when something starts from rest, its initial velocity is zero. So, initial velocity (v\u2080) = 0 m/s. The acceleration is constant at 5 m/s\u00b2, and the distance covered is 200 meters. I need to find the time (t) it takes to cover this distance under these conditions.\n\nI recall there's a kinematic equation that relates distance, initial velocity, acceleration, and time. Let me think about which one it is. There are a few equations I remember:\n\n1. v = v\u2080 + at\n\n2. s = v\u2080t + (1/2)at\u00b2\n\n3. v\u00b2 = v\u2080\u00b2 + 2as\n\nWhere:\n\n- v is the final velocity\n\n- v\u2080 is the initial velocity\n\n- a is the acceleration\n\n- t is the time\n\n- s is the displacement or distance\n\nIn this problem, I don't have the final velocity, so maybe using the second equation would be better, since it directly gives me the distance in terms of time.\n\nSo, plugging in what I know into the second equation:\n\ns = v\u2080t + (1/2)at\u00b2\n\n200 m = (0 m/s)(t) + (1/2)(5 m/s\u00b2)(t\u00b2)\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n200 = 0 + (2.5)t\u00b2\n\nSo, 200 = 2.5t\u00b2\n\nNow, I can solve for t\u00b2:\n\nt\u00b2 = 200 / 2.5 = 80\n\nThen, t = sqrt(80)\n\nSimplifying sqrt(80), that's the same as sqrt(16 * 5) = 4sqrt(5)\n\nBut, what's the approximate value of sqrt(5)? I think it's about 2.236.\n\nSo, t \u2248 4 * 2.236 \u2248 8.944 seconds\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 9.0 s\n\nB. 10.5 s\n\nC. 12.0 s\n\nD. 15.5 s\n\n8.944 is closest to 9.0 s, which is option A.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check if there's another way to approach this, maybe using the average velocity concept or something else, just to confirm.\n\nInitial velocity (v\u2080) = 0 m/s\n\nAcceleration (a) = 5 m/s\u00b2\n\nTime (t) = ?\n\nDistance (s) = 200 m\n\nI also know that the average velocity during uniformly accelerated motion is (v\u2080 + v)/2, where v is the final velocity.\n\nSo, average velocity = (0 + v)/2 = v/2\n\nAnd since distance is average velocity multiplied by time, s = (v/2) * t\n\nI can also use the equation v = v\u2080 + at, which gives v = 0 + 5t = 5t\n\nPlugging back into the distance equation:\n\n200 = (5t)/2 * t\n\n200 = (5t\u00b2)/2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n400 = 5t\u00b2\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5:\n\n80 = t\u00b2\n\nSo, t = sqrt(80) \u2248 8.944 s\n\nAgain, that points to option A. But wait, let's see if there's any possibility of another answer.\n\nMaybe I should consider significant figures or rounding errors. The options are given to one decimal place, so 8.944 would round to 8.9 s, but option A is 9.0 s. Maybe the exact calculation should be carried out without approximation.\n\nLet me try calculating sqrt(80) more accurately. Actually, sqrt(80) is exactly 8.94427191, but to be precise, perhaps the exact answer is 4\u221a5 seconds, and in decimal form, it's approximately 8.944 seconds. So, 9.0 s is a reasonable approximation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the exact answer in terms of radicals. But since the options are in decimal form, I think 9.0 s is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is there any reaction time or something? No, the problem states the car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at 5 m/s\u00b2, covering 200 m. No other forces or factors are mentioned, so I think my calculation is correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 9.0 s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 9.0\\ \\text{s}} \\]"
