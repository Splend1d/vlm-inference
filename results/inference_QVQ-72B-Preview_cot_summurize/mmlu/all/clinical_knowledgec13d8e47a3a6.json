The options are:\n\nA. 10-12 breaths per minute.\n\nB. 8-10 breaths per minute.\n\nC. 20-22 breaths per minute.\n\nD. 14-16 breaths per minute.\n\nHmm, I think I learned about this in biology class, but it's been a while. Let me recall... Respiration is the process by which our bodies take in oxygen and expel carbon dioxide, right? And the rate at which we breathe is called the respiratory rate.\n\nI remember that for adults, the average resting respiratory rate is around 12 to 20 breaths per minute. But I'm not sure about the exact range for males specifically. Maybe there's a difference between males and females, but I think the general range is similar for both.\n\nLet me consider option A: 10-12 breaths per minute. That seems a bit low to me. I think resting heart rate for adults is around 60-100 beats per minute, and respiratory rate is higher than that. So, probably not A.\n\nOption B: 8-10 breaths per minute. That seems even lower. I don't think that's correct for resting respiratory rate. Maybe for someone who is asleep or under anesthesia, but not for a resting adult.\n\nOption C: 20-22 breaths per minute. That seems plausible. I think upper limits can go up to 20 breaths per minute, but I'm not sure if it typically goes up to 22.\n\nOption D: 14-16 breaths per minute. This seems like it might be too high. If the average is around 12 to 20, then 14-16 falls within that, but I think the normal range is wider.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about what's considered tachypnea or bradypnea. Tachypnea is abnormally fast breathing, and bradypnea is abnormally slow breathing. For adults, I think tachypnea is defined as a respiratory rate above 20-22 breaths per minute, and bradypnea is below 8-10 breaths per minute. So, based on that, the normal range should be between 12 and 20 breaths per minute.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 20-22, which might be considered the upper limit, but it includes some rates that are considered tachypneic. Option A is too low, option B is too low, and option D might be too narrow.\n\nMaybe the correct answer is none of the above? But that can't be, since it's a multiple-choice question. Perhaps the question is referring to a specific context or age group.\n\nLet me try to recall some specific numbers. I think the normal respiratory rate for a healthy adult at rest is about 12 to 16 breaths per minute. But I've also heard 12 to 20. Maybe there's some variation based on factors like fitness level, altitude, or temperature.\n\nFor now, I'll go with option D: 14-16 breaths per minute. It seems like a reasonable range within the normal values I recall.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
