                    "text": "So I have this question here that's asking me to identify an example of a chemical change from four different options. The options are:\n\nA. Tearing up a piece of paper\n\nB. Melting ice\n\nC. Mixing vinegar with baking soda\n\nD. Filling a balloon with air\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall what defines a chemical change. From what I remember in science class, a chemical change is when one substance is transformed into another substance with different properties. So, unlike a physical change, which just alters the form or appearance of a substance without changing its chemical composition, a chemical change involves the formation of new substances.\n\nOkay, so with that in mind, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Tearing up a piece of paper.\n\nHmm, tearing a piece of paper means splitting it into smaller pieces, right? But is this a chemical change? I don't think so. The paper is still paper; it's just in smaller pieces. So, this seems like a physical change because the chemical composition of the paper hasn't changed. It's still made of the same materials, just in a different form. So, probably not the answer.\n\nOption B: Melting ice.\n\nMelting ice is turning solid ice into liquid water. Now, is this a chemical change? Well, I know that ice is frozen water, and when it melts, it becomes liquid water. But both ice and liquid water are still made of H2O molecules. So, the chemical composition hasn't changed; it's just changed from a solid state to a liquid state. That sounds like a physical change to me. Therefore, probably not the example of a chemical change they're looking for.\n\nOption C: Mixing vinegar with baking soda.\n\nOh, this sounds interesting. I've heard that mixing vinegar and baking soda produces some kind of reaction, right? Like, it fizzes or bubbles up. That makes me think that something new is being formed. Let me think about this more carefully.\n\nVinegar is primarily acetic acid mixed with water, and baking soda is sodium bicarbonate. When you mix them together, they react to produce carbon dioxide gas, water, and sodium acetate. So, new substances are being formed as a result of this mixture. That sounds a lot like a chemical change because the original substances are being transformed into different substances with different properties.\n\nYeah, this seems like a strong candidate for a chemical change.\n\nOption D: Filling a balloon with air.\n\nFilling a balloon with air involves stretching the balloon material and compressing the air inside. But does this involve any chemical changes? I don't think so. The air inside the balloon is still just air, consisting of nitrogen, oxygen, and other gases. The balloon material might stretch, but that's probably just a physical change in its shape, not a change in its chemical composition.\n\nSo, again, this seems like a physical change rather than a chemical one.\n\nAlright, summarizing all this:\n\n- Option A: Tearing up a piece of paper \u2013 physical change\n\n- Option B: Melting ice \u2013 physical change\n\n- Option C: Mixing vinegar with baking soda \u2013 chemical change\n\n- Option D: Filling a balloon with air \u2013 physical change\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option C: Mixing vinegar with baking soda.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check what constitutes a chemical change. Chemical changes involve the formation of new substances with new properties, often resulting from bonds being broken and reformed in the atoms and molecules involved. In contrast, physical changes involve changes in state or form without altering the chemical composition of the substance.\n\nSo, based on this, my initial assessment seems accurate. Mixing vinegar and baking soda definitely qualifies as a chemical change due to the production of new substances, whereas the other options are examples of physical changes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
