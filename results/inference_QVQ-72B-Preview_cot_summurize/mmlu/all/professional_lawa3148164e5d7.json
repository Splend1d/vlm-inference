                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step. So, we have a farmer who owns an olive grove. He gives a mortgage on the olive grove to his friend to secure a $90,000 loan. Then, he gives another mortgage to a co-worker for a $120,000 loan, and finally, a third mortgage to an investor for a $110,000 loan. The co-worker records their mortgage first, followed by the investor, and then the friend. Now, in a foreclosure proceeding involving these three parties, the olive grove is sold for $220,000. The question is, how much, if any, should go to the investor?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the concept of mortgages and how recording them affects priority in case of foreclosure. Generally, mortgages are secured interests in real property that help ensure repayment of a loan. When multiple mortgages are placed on the same property, the order in which they were recorded can determine their priority in case the property is sold, especially in a foreclosure.\n\nThe recording statute mentioned says that any unrecorded instrument affecting land title is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith who records first. This suggests that recording is crucial for protecting one's interest against others who might have an interest in the same property.\n\nSo, let's list out the sequence of events:\n\n1. Friend gives a mortgage to secure $90,000.\n\n2. Co-worker gives a mortgage to secure $120,000.\n\n3. Investor gives a mortgage to secure $110,000.\n\n4. Co-worker records their mortgage.\n\n5. Investor records their mortgage.\n\n6. Friend records their mortgage.\n\nFrom this, it seems that the co-worker recorded first, followed by the investor, and then the friend. Assuming that no one had prior knowledge of the other mortgages, the recording order might determine the priority.\n\nBut wait, the farmer gave the mortgages in a different order: first to the friend, then to the co-worker, then to the investor. However, recording is what perfects the interest and establishes priority over subsequent claimants.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, the \"first to record\" rule applies, meaning that the first mortgage to be properly recorded has priority over subsequent mortgages, even if those mortgages were given earlier in time.\n\nGiven that, the co-worker recorded first, so their mortgage has the highest priority, followed by the investor, and then the friend.\n\nNow, the olive grove is sold for $220,000 in foreclosure. The proceeds from the sale are used to pay off the mortgage holders in order of their priority.\n\nLet's calculate how the $220,000 is distributed:\n\n1. Co-worker's mortgage: $120,000 (first priority)\n\n2. Investor's mortgage: $110,000 (second priority)\n\n3. Friend's mortgage: $90,000 (third priority)\n\nTotal claims: $120,000 + $110,000 + $90,000 = $320,000\n\nHowever, the sale proceeds are only $220,000, which is less than the total claims.\n\nSo, the co-worker gets paid first: $120,000\n\nRemaining proceeds: $220,000 - $120,000 = $100,000\n\nNext, the investor gets paid: but they have a claim of $110,000, but only $100,000 is left.\n\nSo, the investor would receive $100,000, and still have an unpaid balance of $10,000.\n\nFinally, the friend, who has a $90,000 claim, gets nothing because there's no money left after paying the co-worker and the investor.\n\nBut wait a minute, the question is asking how much should go to the investor. According to this calculation, the investor should get $100,000 from the foreclosure sale proceeds.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. $0.00\n\nB. $90,000.00\n\nC. $100,000.00\n\nD. $110,000.00\n\nMy calculation suggests that the investor should get $100,000, which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's any other factor that might affect this distribution.\n\nFirst, are there any junior liens or other claims that might come before the investor? From the information given, it seems that the co-worker has the first priority, followed by the investor, and then the friend.\n\nAlso, assuming that there are no other costs or expenses from the foreclosure process that need to be deducted from the proceeds, such as legal fees or sale costs.\n\nAdditionally, the recording statute mentions that an unrecorded instrument is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith who records first. In this case, all three mortgages were recorded, with the co-worker recording first, then the investor, then the friend.\n\nTherefore, the priority should indeed be co-worker first, investor second, and friend third.\n\nGiven that, and with only $220,000 available to satisfy $320,000 in claims, the distribution should be:\n\n- Co-worker: full $120,000\n\n- Investor: $100,000 (partial payment of their $110,000 claim)\n\n- Friend: nothing\n\nThus, the investor should receive $100,000 from the foreclosure sale proceeds.\n\nI think the answer is C. $100,000.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
