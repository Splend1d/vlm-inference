                    "text": "So I have this MA process: \\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \\). I need to find its characteristic roots. I'm a bit confused because I thought characteristic roots were associated with AR processes, not MA processes. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I recall that for an AR process, like \\( y_t = \\phi_1 y_{t-1} + \\phi_2 y_{t-2} + u_t \\), we have a characteristic equation derived from the lag polynomial. But this is an MA process, which typically involves current and past error terms.\n\nLooking back at the equation, it's an MA process of order 2, since it includes \\( u_{t-2} \\). The general form of an MA(2) process is \\( y_t = \\theta_0 u_t + \\theta_1 u_{t-1} + \\theta_2 u_{t-2} \\). Comparing this to my given equation, \\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \\), I can see that \\( \\theta_0 = 1 \\), \\( \\theta_1 = -3 \\), and \\( \\theta_2 = 1 \\).\n\nNow, for an MA process, the characteristic equation is related to the moving average operator. I think the characteristic equation for an MA(q) process is \\( 1 - \\theta_1 L - \\theta_2 L^2 - \\dots - \\theta_q L^q = 0 \\), where \\( L \\) is the lag operator.\n\nSo, for my process, the characteristic equation should be \\( 1 - (-3)L - L^2 = 0 \\), which simplifies to \\( 1 + 3L - L^2 = 0 \\).\n\nTo find the roots, I need to solve \\( 1 + 3L - L^2 = 0 \\). Let's rearrange it: \\( -L^2 + 3L + 1 = 0 \\), or \\( L^2 - 3L - 1 = 0 \\).\n\nNow, solving this quadratic equation for \\( L \\):\n\n\\( L = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 4}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\)\n\nSo, the characteristic roots are \\( \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\) and \\( \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\). Let me calculate approximate values to see if they match any of the options.\n\n\\( \\sqrt{13} \\) is approximately 3.606, so:\n\nFirst root: \\( \\frac{3 + 3.606}{2} = \\frac{6.606}{2} = 3.303 \\)\n\nSecond root: \\( \\frac{3 - 3.606}{2} = \\frac{-0.606}{2} = -0.303 \\)\n\nSo, the roots are approximately 3.303 and -0.303. Looking at the options:\n\nA. 1 and 2\n\nB. 1 and 0.5\n\nC. 2 and -0.5\n\nD. 1 and -3\n\nNone of these match exactly, but maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the characteristic equation. Starting again:\n\nThe general MA(2) model is \\( y_t = \\theta_0 u_t + \\theta_1 u_{t-1} + \\theta_2 u_{t-2} \\).\n\nIn my case, \\( \\theta_0 = 1 \\), \\( \\theta_1 = -3 \\), \\( \\theta_2 = 1 \\).\n\nThe characteristic equation for an MA(q) process is \\( 1 - \\theta_1 L - \\theta_2 L^2 - \\dots - \\theta_q L^q = 0 \\).\n\nSo, for MA(2): \\( 1 - \\theta_1 L - \\theta_2 L^2 = 0 \\).\n\nPlugging in the values: \\( 1 - (-3)L - L^2 = 0 \\), which is \\( 1 + 3L - L^2 = 0 \\).\n\nRearranged: \\( -L^2 + 3L + 1 = 0 \\), or \\( L^2 - 3L - 1 = 0 \\).\n\nSolving: \\( L = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 4}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\).\n\nYes, same result as before. So, the roots are approximately 3.303 and -0.303.\n\nNone of the options match these values exactly. Maybe I need to consider that the characteristic roots are reciprocals of the roots of the characteristic equation. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nActually, for an MA process, the characteristic equation is defined differently in some texts. Let me look it up.\n\nUpon checking, the characteristic equation for an MA(q) process is often given as \\( 1 - \\theta_1 B - \\theta_2 B^2 - \\dots - \\theta_q B^q = 0 \\), where \\( B \\) is the backshift operator.\n\nHowever, some texts define it differently, perhaps as \\( 1 - \\theta_1 z - \\theta_2 z^2 - \\dots - \\theta_q z^q = 0 \\), and the roots are the values of \\( z \\).\n\nIn any case, the roots I calculated seem correct based on the equation I set up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the characteristic equation should be set to zero differently. Let me consider \\( 1 + \\theta_1 L + \\theta_2 L^2 = 0 \\), but that doesn't seem right for MA processes.\n\nWait, no. The standard form is \\( 1 - \\theta_1 L - \\theta_2 L^2 - \\dots - \\theta_q L^q = 0 \\).\n\nI think I'm correct in setting it up as \\( 1 + 3L - L^2 = 0 \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the invertibility condition for MA processes, which requires that the roots of the characteristic equation lie outside the unit circle, but that doesn't help me here.\n\nGiven that, and my calculated roots not matching any options, perhaps there's a mistake in the question or the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the characteristic roots are not the roots of this equation but something else.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Perhaps I should find the characteristic equation by taking the Z-transform or something similar.\n\nThe Z-transform of the MA(2) process \\( y_t = \\theta_0 u_t + \\theta_1 u_{t-1} + \\theta_2 u_{t-2} \\) is \\( Y(z) = \\theta(z) U(z) \\), where \\( \\theta(z) = 1 + \\theta_1 z^{-1} + \\theta_2 z^{-2} \\).\n\nThe characteristic polynomial is often related to \\( \\theta(z) \\), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the autocorrelation function or something, but that seems unnecessary for finding characteristic roots.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the AR representation of the MA process.\n\nAn MA(2) process can be represented as an infinite AR process, but that seems complicated for this purpose.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the partial autocorrelation function, but again, that seems off-track.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Suppose I consider the MA(2) model in terms of the error terms.\n\nGiven \\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \\), I can write this as \\( y_t - u_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \\).\n\nBut that doesn't seem helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express it in terms of the backshift operator \\( B \\), where \\( B y_t = y_{t-1} \\), etc.\n\nSo, \\( y_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \\) can be written as \\( y_t - u_t + 3 B u_t - B^2 u_t = 0 \\), but that seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the generating function or some other representation.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the characteristic roots are related to the denominator of the MA operator.\n\nIn time series analysis, for an MA(q) process, the characteristic equation is often \\( 1 - \\theta_1 z - \\theta_2 z^2 - \\dots - \\theta_q z^q = 0 \\), and the roots are the values of \\( z \\) that satisfy this equation.\n\nSo, in my case, \\( 1 - (-3)z - z^2 = 0 \\), which simplifies to \\( 1 + 3z - z^2 = 0 \\).\n\nSolving this: \\( z^2 - 3z - 1 = 0 \\), leading to \\( z = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\), same as before.\n\nSo, I must be doing something right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the characteristic roots are the reciprocals of these roots.\n\nLet me check that. If \\( z = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\), then \\( \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{2}{3 + \\sqrt{13}} \\), which is approximately \\( \\frac{2}{6.606} \\approx 0.303 \\), and similarly for the other root.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\) is approximately 0.303, and the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\) is approximately -3.303.\n\nBut none of these match the given options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the characteristic roots are the roots themselves, not their reciprocals.\n\nBut then, my roots are approximately 3.303 and -0.303, which still don't match the options.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the characteristic equation is different for MA processes.\n\nLet me look up the definition of characteristic roots for MA processes.\n\nAfter some research, I find that for an MA(q) process, the characteristic equation is indeed \\( 1 - \\theta_1 z - \\theta_2 z^2 - \\dots - \\theta_q z^q = 0 \\), and the roots are the values of \\( z \\) that satisfy this equation.\n\nTherefore, in my case, with \\( \\theta_1 = -3 \\) and \\( \\theta_2 = 1 \\), the characteristic equation is \\( 1 + 3z - z^2 = 0 \\), leading to roots \\( z = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\), as I previously calculated.\n\nSo, perhaps the options are mislabeled or there's a mistake in the question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the characteristic roots are related to the AR representation of the MA process.\n\nLet me attempt to find the AR representation of this MA(2) process.\n\nAn MA(2) process can be represented as an AR(\u221e) process, but that's not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find an equivalent AR process by solving the Yule-Walker equations, but that seems too involved for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the autocorrelation function to infer the characteristic roots, but again, that seems indirect.\n\nGiven that, and my consistent calculation leading to roots approximately 3.303 and -0.303, none of which match the provided options, I suspect there might be an error in the question or the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the characteristic roots are the coefficients themselves, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the MA process can be rewritten in a different form.\n\nLet me try to rearrange the original equation: \\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \\).\n\nI can write this as \\( y_t - u_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \\), but that doesn't seem helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express \\( y_t \\) in terms of \\( y_{t-1} \\) or something, but since it's an MA process, it's not directly related to past \\( y \\)'s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the generating function or some other transform, but that seems unnecessary.\n\nGiven that, and my consistent calculation leading to roots approximately 3.303 and -0.303, none of which match the provided options, I'm starting to think that perhaps the question is testing a different concept or there's a misinterpretation of the MA process.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the characteristic roots are related to the denominator of the MA operator in the Z-domain.\n\nIn that case, the MA operator is \\( \\theta(B) = 1 + \\theta_1 B + \\theta_2 B^2 = 1 - 3B + B^2 \\), since \\( \\theta_1 = -3 \\) and \\( \\theta_2 = 1 \\).\n\nSetting \\( \\theta(B) = 0 \\), we have \\( B^2 - 3B + 1 = 0 \\), which gives the same roots as before: \\( B = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\).\n\nSo, again, the roots are approximately 3.303 and -0.303, which don't match any of the options.\n\nGiven that, I'm inclined to conclude that none of the provided options are correct based on my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the question or the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the characteristic roots are the inverses of these roots, as sometimes done in signal processing.\n\nIf that's the case, then the roots would be approximately 0.303 and -0.303, which still don't match any options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the characteristic roots are related to the poles of the system, which for an MA process are the roots of the characteristic equation.\n\nGiven that, and my consistent calculation, I'm still not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the characteristic roots are related to the roots of the characteristic polynomial set equal to zero differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the characteristic equation is \\( \\theta(B) = 0 \\), which in this case is \\( B^2 - 3B + 1 = 0 \\), leading to the same roots.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different definition for characteristic roots in the context of MA processes.\n\nGiven that, and my inability to match the calculated roots to any of the provided options, I suspect there might be an error in the question or the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the roots of the characteristic equation for an AR process that is equivalent to this MA process, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the characteristic roots are related to the partial autocorrelation function, but that seems unrelated.\n\nGiven that, and my consistent calculation leading to roots approximately 3.303 and -0.303, none of which match the provided options, I'm going to conclude that perhaps the correct answer isn't listed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the MA process.\n\nLet me double-check the original equation: \\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \\).\n\nIs this an MA(2) process? Yes, since it includes \\( u_{t-2} \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's an MA(1) process in disguise, but that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the equation, and it should be \\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_{t-1} \\), which would simplify to \\( y_t = -2u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \\), but that still doesn't align with the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is \\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \\), which is indeed an MA(2) process with \\( \\theta_1 = -3 \\) and \\( \\theta_2 = 1 \\), leading to the characteristic equation \\( B^2 - 3B + 1 = 0 \\), with roots \\( \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\), as previously calculated.\n\nGiven that, and my inability to reconcile this with any of the provided options, I'm going to conclude that perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, or there's a mistake in the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the characteristic roots are related to the denominator of the MA operator in a different way, but I can't see it.\n\nGiven that, I'm going to tentatively select option C: 2 and -0.5, as it's the closest to my calculated roots of approximately 3.303 and -0.303, but I'm not entirely confident in this choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a scaling factor or something else I'm missing.\n\nGiven that, and the time I've spent on this, I'll go with option C: 2 and -0.5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
