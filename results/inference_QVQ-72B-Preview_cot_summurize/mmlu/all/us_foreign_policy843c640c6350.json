Hmm, I need to figure out which one is the main civilian advisor to the president on military matters.\n\nFirst, let's think about each option:\n\nA. National Security Adviser: I know that the National Security Adviser is part of the National Security Council and advises the president on national security and foreign policies. They probably have a lot to do with military matters, but is he the principal civilian adviser specifically on the military?\n\nB. Director of the CIA: The CIA is the Central Intelligence Agency, which is responsible for gathering and analyzing information from around the world. The director oversees this agency, but is he the one who advises the president directly on military issues?\n\nC. Secretary of Defense: This sounds promising. The Secretary of Defense is the head of the Department of Defense, which oversees the military branches. He should be deeply involved in military affairs and would likely be the primary civilian advising the president on military matters.\n\nD. Secretary of State: The Secretary of State is in charge of international relations and diplomacy. While they might advise on foreign policy, which can relate to military actions, their primary focus seems to be more on diplomacy than direct military affairs.\n\nSo, comparing these, the Secretary of Defense seems to be the most directly involved with military matters and therefore the most likely to be the president's principal civilian adviser on the military.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider if there's any possibility that another role could also fit this description. For example, the National Security Adviser might also play a significant role in advising the president on military matters, but their role is more overarching, covering both national security and foreign policy, whereas the Secretary of Defense is specifically focused on defense and military issues.\n\nThe Director of the CIA is more involved with intelligence gathering and analysis, which can inform military decisions, but again, it's not directly about advising on military operations or strategy.\n\nThe Secretary of State is focused on diplomatic relations and might advise on the political implications of military actions, but again, not directly on military matters themselves.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the Secretary of Defense is the most appropriate choice for the president's principal civilian adviser on the military.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff could be considered in this role? Oh, but the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is a military officer, not a civilian. The question specifies \"civilian adviser,\" so that probably disqualifies the Chairman.\n\nJust to double-check, let's recall that the Secretary of Defense is a civilian position, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. It's been that way since the establishment of the Department of Defense in 1947. So, yes, the Secretary of Defense is indeed the principal civilian adviser to the president on military matters.\n\nI think I've got it right. The answer should be C. secretary of defense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
