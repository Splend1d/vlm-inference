False, False; C. True, False; D. False, True. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst statement: \"The Stanford Sentiment Treebank contained movie reviews, not book reviews.\" Hmm, I remember learning about the Stanford Sentiment Treebank in class. It's a dataset used for sentiment analysis, right? I think it's based on movie reviews. But just to be sure, maybe I should look it up to confirm.\n\nLet me recall: the Stanford Sentiment Treebank is a dataset that provides phrase-level sentiment annotations for movie reviews. It was introduced by Socher et al. in 2013. They used the IMDb movie review dataset to create this treebank. So, yes, it's movie reviews, not book reviews. That means the first statement is true.\n\nNow, the second statement: \"The Penn Treebank has been used for language modeling.\" I've heard of the Penn Treebank before too. It's a widely used resource in natural language processing, isn't it? It's a treebank, which means it's a corpus of text with syntactic annotations, like parse trees. I think it's been used for various NLP tasks, including language modeling.\n\nLet me think about this. Language modeling involves predicting the probability of sequences of words, which is crucial for tasks like machine translation, speech recognition, and text generation. The Penn Treebank has been a standard dataset for training and evaluating language models, especially in the early days of neural language models.\n\nI recall that researchers often use the Penn Treebank as a benchmark for language modeling tasks. So, yes, it has been used for language modeling. That makes the second statement true as well.\n\nSo, both statements are true. That would make the correct answer A. True, True.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. For the first statement, it's definitely movie reviews in the Stanford Sentiment Treebank, not book reviews. And for the Penn Treebank, it's indeed been used extensively for language modeling.\n\nIs there any chance that the Penn Treebank might not be primarily used for language modeling? No, I don't think so. It's a common dataset for training and evaluating language models.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The answer should be A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
