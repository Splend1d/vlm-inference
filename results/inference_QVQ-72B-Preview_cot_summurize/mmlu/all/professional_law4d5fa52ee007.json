By the terms of the lease, the friend expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the friend, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The friend and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the friend, still owing the landlord three months back rent, assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a professor, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the professor would pay the landlord the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The landlord never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the landlord conveyed his property interest in the premises to a new owner. After residing in the house for a year, the professor subleased the third floor to a student for a term of two years; the agreement provided that the professor would receive a monthly rental payment of $100. After the student had made regular rental payments to the professor for the first six months of the sublease, he defaulted. The following month, the professor sent the new owner $200 as payment for rent and notified him that he should collect the remaining $100 from the student, who refused to vacate the premises.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a landlord who owns a three-story house and leases it to his friend for 10 years. The friend has to pay $300 a month in rent and also pay the taxes on the property. The lease says the friend can't assign or sublease the property to anyone else. Got it.\n\nSo, the friend lives there for two years and then, even though he still owes three months of back rent, he assigns his lease to a professor. The professor agrees to pay the $300 monthly rent, but the assignment doesn't mention anything about paying taxes. Also, the friend and the professor didn't ask the landlord's permission for this assignment, even though the lease said no assignments or subleases were allowed.\n\nThe landlord doesn't object to this assignment, which is interesting. So, now the professor is the tenant, paying $300 a month. Six months after that, the landlord sells the property to a new owner. So, the new owner inherits this lease situation.\n\nAfter a year of living there, the professor subleases the third floor to a student for two years, with the student paying the professor $100 a month. So, the professor is still responsible for paying the full $300 to the new owner, I assume.\n\nFor the first six months, the student pays the $100 on time, but then defaults. The next month, the professor pays the new owner $200 and tells the owner to collect the remaining $100 from the student, who refuses to leave the house.\n\nNow, the new owner wants to sue the student to get the extra $100 in rent. The question is, will the new owner probably recover that $100 from the student?\n\nOkay, let's think about this.\n\nFirst, who has the right to collect rent from the student? The professor subleased the third floor to the student, so the professor and the student have a sublease agreement. The professor is still the main tenant, leasing from the new owner, and the student is subleasing from the professor.\n\nIn general, subleases create a relationship between the sublessor (the professor) and the sublessee (the student). The sublessee pays rent to the sublessor, who is supposed to pass it on to the main landlord.\n\nSo, in this case, the student pays $100 to the professor, and the professor is responsible for paying the full $300 to the new owner.\n\nWhen the student defaults, it's typically between the professor and the student. The new owner's relationship is directly with the professor, who is the main tenant.\n\nSo, if the professor pays only $200 to the new owner instead of the full $300, the new owner can go after the professor for the remaining $100, not directly after the student.\n\nBut the question is whether the new owner can sue the student directly for the $100.\n\nOption A says the landlord and sublessee are in privity of estate, which might suggest some direct relationship, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nOption B says the landlord can recover even if he didn't object to the sublease. But did the landlord know about the sublease? The scenario says the professor subleased to the student and then notified the new owner when the student defaulted. So, the new owner might not have known about the sublease until then.\n\nOption C says the professor would only be held liable, implying that the student wouldn't be directly liable to the new owner.\n\nOption D says the professor remains liable, which I think is correct, but the question is whether the new owner can collect from the student.\n\nI think the key here is that the student has a sublease agreement with the professor, not directly with the new owner. So, the student's obligation is to pay the professor, not the new owner.\n\nIf the student stops paying the professor, and the professor is still supposed to pay the new owner, then the professor is on the hook for the full rent, regardless of whether the student pays or not.\n\nTherefore, the new owner should go after the professor for the missing $100, not the student.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D: not recover, because the professor remains liable.\n\nBut let me think about this again.\n\nIs there any way the new owner could collect directly from the student?\n\nWell, the student is occupying the property, so perhaps the new owner could evict the student for non-payment, but that's a different issue.\n\nIn terms of collecting rent, the rent is between the professor and the student. The student doesn't have a direct rental agreement with the new owner.\n\nSo, unless there's some privity of estate or some other legal doctrine that creates a direct relationship, which I'm not sure about, I think the new owner can't collect directly from the student.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D: not recover, because the professor remains liable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
