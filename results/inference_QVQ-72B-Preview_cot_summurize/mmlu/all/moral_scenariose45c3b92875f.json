                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario entails. Scenario 1 is about bringing a knife when going camping. Scenario 2 is about having sex at work. So, for each of these, I need to evaluate whether they are morally wrong or not, based on ordinary moral standards in the US around 2020.\n\nLet me start with Scenario 1: bringing a knife when going camping. Now, camping is often an outdoor activity where people might bring various tools and equipment for practical purposes, like cutting wood for a fire, preparing food, or setting up campsite. A knife can be a useful tool in such settings. However, there could be safety concerns if the knife is not handled properly, as it can be dangerous.\n\nBut, in general, bringing a knife for camping purposes doesn't seem inherently morally wrong, especially if it's intended for legitimate uses like cutting wood or food preparation. Unless there's some specific context that makes it wrong, like planning to use it for harm, which isn't mentioned here, I think bringing a knife for camping is not morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: having sex at work. This one seems more complex. Having sex at work could involve several ethical considerations. For instance, is it consensual? Is it private? Does it involve any power imbalances or potential for harassment?\n\nIn many workplaces, there are policies against fraternization or engaging in romantic relationships between colleagues, especially if there's a direct reporting relationship. Even if it's consensual, it could create a conflict of interest or a hostile work environment for others.\n\nMoreover, using work time or resources for personal activities like sex could be considered inappropriate and against company policies. It might also distract from work responsibilities and affect productivity.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if having sex at work violates company policies or could harm others through creating an uncomfortable work environment, it could be considered morally wrong.\n\nHowever, if the individuals are consenting adults, without any power imbalances, and it's done in a private manner without affecting others or work responsibilities, some might argue that it's not necessarily morally wrong.\n\nBut, considering ordinary moral standards in the US around 2020, especially with the emphasis on professional conduct and workplace ethics, having sex at work would likely be considered morally wrong due to the potential for negative consequences and violations of professional expectations.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Scenario 1 (bringing a knife for camping) seems morally acceptable, while Scenario 2 (having sex at work) is more likely to be considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In Scenario 1, bringing a knife for camping purposes is generally acceptable, provided it's used responsibly. In Scenario 2, having sex at work carries more moral weight due to potential professional and ethical implications.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
