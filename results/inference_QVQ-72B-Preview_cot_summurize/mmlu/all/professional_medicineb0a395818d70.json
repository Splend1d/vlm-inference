He is a skilled and talented physician with no known history of substance or alcohol use disorder. He is married with three children, and his wife is pregnant with twins. The physician was recently hired and has had no actions on his license by any state medical board. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA. Ask the physician if he is sober, and if he says yes, allow him to complete his shift\nB. Explain to the physician that you suspect he is intoxicated and ask him to submit to a blood sample to check his blood alcohol concentration\nC.

He's a new hire, has a good reputation, and no history of substance abuse that I know of. But today, he looks tired, a bit disheveled, and there's an odor of alcohol on his breath. He's 33, married with three kids, and his wife is expecting twins. That must be stressful, but that's not really my concern right now. My concern is ensuring patient safety and maintaining professional standards.\n\nOption A is to ask him if he's sober and if he says yes, let him finish his shift. Hmm, that seems too casual. He might be impaired, and his judgment could be off. Plus, just because he says he's sober doesn't mean he is. I can't take his word for it when patient lives are at stake.\n\nOption B is to explain my suspicions and ask him to submit to a blood test to check his blood alcohol concentration. That sounds reasonable. It's direct, and it gets to the point. But I need to think about how to approach this without causing unnecessary tension or embarrassment. Maybe I should consider his dignity and privacy.\n\nOption C is to relieve him of duty and alert the hospital's patient safety officer. That seems like a formal step. Is it too harsh? Well, if he's impaired, it's probably the right thing to do. Patient safety comes first, and if there's any doubt about his ability to perform, he shouldn't be treating patients.\n\nOption D is to offer to cover his shift so he can sleep in his office. That's a nice thought, considering he might be tired, but it doesn't address the alcohol issue. If he's been drinking, it's not just about being tired; it's about potential impairment.\n\nI need to balance compassion with responsibility. He's a good doctor, but if he's impaired, he can't treat patients. I think option C is the most appropriate next step. Relieving him of duty ensures patient safety, and involving the patient safety officer is standard procedure in such cases. It's important to follow hospital policy and protect both the physician and the patients.\n\nBut before I do that, maybe I should talk to him privately. See if there's something going on in his personal life that's causing him stress. Offer support or resources if needed. But ultimately, if there's any doubt about his sobriety, he can't continue treating patients.\n\nSo, my plan is to speak with him in private, express my concerns, and then proceed with option C if he admits to drinking or if the odor is strong enough to indicate impairment. It's a tough call, but patient safety has to be the priority.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
