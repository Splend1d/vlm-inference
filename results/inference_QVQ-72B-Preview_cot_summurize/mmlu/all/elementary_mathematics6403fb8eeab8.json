Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that addition and subtraction can get a bit tricky with negative numbers, so I need to be careful here. The problem is -4 plus -3. So, both numbers are negative.\n\nI remember that adding two negative numbers is like adding their absolute values and then applying the negative sign to the result. So, the absolute value of -4 is 4, and the absolute value of -3 is 3. Adding those together gives me 7. Since both numbers were negative, the result should also be negative. So, -7.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think about it in terms of debt. If I owe $4 and then I owe another $3, in total I owe $7. So, that would be -7 in total. That seems to make sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it on a number line. Starting at -4, and then adding -3 would mean moving another 3 units to the left. So, -4 to -5, then -6, then -7. Yeah, that also points to -7.\n\nLet me consider another approach. I know that adding a negative is the same as subtracting a positive. So, -4 + (-3) is the same as -4 - 3. That also gives me -7.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me try using some algebra. Suppose I have the equation -4 + (-3) = x. I can simplify -4 + (-3) to -7, so x = -7.\n\nOkay, now I'm pretty confident that the answer is -7. Let me just make sure I'm not missing something here. Sometimes, people get confused when there are two negative signs next to each other, but in this case, it's clear that both numbers are negative, and there are no parentheses causing any ambiguity.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. -7\n\nB. -1\n\nC. 1\n\nD. 7\n\nIt's straightforward. The correct answer should be A. -7.\n\nWait, but just to be extra sure, maybe I can think about an example with smaller numbers or something different. Let's say I have -1 + (-1). That's the same as -1 - 1, which is -2. Similarly, -2 + (-2) is -4. So, following the same pattern, -4 + (-3) should indeed be -7.\n\nAnother way to look at it is using the rules of arithmetic for integers. The sum of two negative integers is a negative integer equal to the sum of their absolute values, but with a negative sign. So, -4 + (-3) = -(4 + 3) = -7.\n\nI think that's comprehensive enough. I can't see any reason why the answer would be anything other than -7.\n\nJust to be absolutely certain, perhaps I can check online or in a math textbook. But honestly, this is a fundamental concept in arithmetic, and I'm quite sure about it.\n\nAlright, I'm ready to confirm that the answer is A. -7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. -7} \\]"
