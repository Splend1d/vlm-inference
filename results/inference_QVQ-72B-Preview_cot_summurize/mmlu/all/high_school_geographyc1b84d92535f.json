Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Pacific Ring of Fire is a region around the Pacific Ocean where a lot of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions happen. It's because of tectonic plates moving around there. I think it's called the Ring of Fire because it's shaped like a circle around the Pacific.\n\nLet me think about each country one by one.\n\nStarting with Brazil. I know Brazil is in South America, and it's mostly tropical with the Amazon rainforest. But is it part of the Ring of Fire? I don't think so. I don't recall any major volcanoes or earthquake zones in Brazil. Maybe it's not on the Ring of Fire.\n\nNext is Australia. Australia is its own continent, and it's down under, near the Pacific Ocean. But again, I don't remember Australia having a lot of volcanic activity or earthquakes. Maybe some earthquakes, but not as much as other places. Probably not part of the Ring of Fire.\n\nThen there's Chile. Chile is also in South America, but it's on the west coast, right along the Pacific Ocean. I seem to remember that the west coast of South America is part of the Ring of Fire. There are mountains there, like the Andes, which were formed by tectonic plates crashing together. And I think Chile has had some big earthquakes in the past. So, this seems plausible.\n\nLastly, there's India. India is in South Asia, and it's nowhere near the Pacific Ocean. It's bordered by the Indian Ocean. The Ring of Fire is around the Pacific, so India is probably not part of it.\n\nSo, based on what I know, Chile seems to be the country among these options that is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. Let me just double-check that.\n\nI recall that the Ring of Fire includes the coastal regions of South America, like Chile and Peru, and also extends up through Central America and the West Coast of North America, including California and Alaska. Then it continues around through Asia, including countries like Japan and Indonesia, and down through the Pacific Islands.\n\nGiven that, Chile is definitely on the Ring of Fire. Whereas Brazil is more central in South America, not on the coastal region where the tectonic activity is happening. Australia is its own thing down south, and India is on the other side of the world from the Pacific Ocean.\n\nSo, I'm pretty confident that the correct answer is Chile.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Chile}} \\]"
