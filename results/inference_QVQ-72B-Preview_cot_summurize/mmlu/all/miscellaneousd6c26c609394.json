Walter Mondale, C. Gary Hart, D. Jimmy Carter.\" Hmm, I need to figure out who exactly ran against Reagan in 1984.\n\nFirst off, I know that Ronald Reagan was the President of the United States from 1981 to 1989, so he was re-elected in 1984. That means he must have run for a second term that year. Now, I need to recall who the Democratic nominee was in 1984.\n\nLet me think about this. I remember that Walter Mondale was a prominent Democrat at that time. He was Jimmy Carter's Vice President, right? And Jimmy Carter was the President before Reagan, from 1977 to 1981. So, Carter lost to Reagan in 1980. But the question is about 1984.\n\nI think Walter Mondale ran for President in 1984. Let me see if that's correct. If Reagan was running for re-election in 1984, and Mondale was a significant figure in the Democratic Party at that time, it makes sense that he might have been the nominee.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Michael Dukakis: I think he ran for President later, in 1988, against George H.W. Bush. So, probably not in 1984.\n\nB. Walter Mondale: As I thought earlier, he seems like a likely candidate for 1984.\n\nC. Gary Hart: I recall he was a candidate in the 1980s, but I think he dropped out before the election.\n\nD. Jimmy Carter: He was already President from 1977 to 1981 and lost to Reagan in 1980, so it's unlikely he would run again in 1984.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that Walter Mondale was the Democratic nominee in 1984. Let me just double-check this.\n\nI remember that in 1984, Walter Mondale chose Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate, and they ran against Reagan and his Vice President, George H.W. Bush. Reagan won a landslide victory that year.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Walter Mondale.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
