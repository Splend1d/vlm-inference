                    "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out what the difference is between M1 and M2. I remember that M1 and M2 are different measures of the money supply in an economy, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let's see.\n\nFirst off, I think M1 is the narrowest definition of the money supply. It includes the most liquid forms of money, right? Like cash and checking deposits. So, physical currency that people hold, and money in checking accounts that can be easily accessed and spent.\n\nM2, on the other hand, is supposed to be a broader measure of the money supply. It includes everything in M1 plus some additional types of deposits that are slightly less liquid but still pretty accessible.\n\nSo, option A says that M1 is a first mortgage and M2 is a second mortgage. That sounds off to me. Mortgages are loans secured by property, and that doesn't seem directly related to measures of the money supply. Maybe there's some connection I'm missing, but I don't think that's the correct answer.\n\nOption B says that M2 is M1 plus assets that are more liquid. Hmm. Wait a minute, that doesn't seem right. M1 already includes the most liquid assets, like cash and checking deposits. M2 includes M1 plus less liquid assets, like savings deposits and money market accounts. So, actually, M2 includes assets that are less liquid than those in M1, not more liquid. So, this option seems incorrect.\n\nOption C says that M2 includes savings deposits. That rings a bell. I think savings deposits are part of M2 but not part of M1. So, yes, M2 is M1 plus savings deposits, plus some other types of accounts like money market deposits. So, this seems like a correct statement.\n\nOption D says that M1 is larger than M2. Well, since M2 includes M1 plus additional types of deposits, M2 is actually larger than M1. So, this statement is incorrect.\n\nSo, based on this, it looks like option C is the correct answer. M2 includes savings deposits, which are not part of M1. Let me just double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nM1 typically consists of:\n\n- Currency in circulation (physical money)\n\n- Demand deposits (checking accounts)\n\nM2 consists of M1 plus:\n\n- Savings deposits\n\n- Time deposits (certificates of deposit, etc.)\n\n- Money market mutual fund balances\n\nSo, yes, M2 does include savings deposits, which are not part of M1. Therefore, the difference between M1 and M2 is that M2 includes additional types of deposits that are slightly less liquid than those in M1, but still readily accessible.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. M2 includes savings deposits.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
