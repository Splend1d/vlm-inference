                    "text": "So I have this question about export processing zones, or EPZs. I need to figure out which option isn't a feature of an EPZ. The options are:\n\nA. Tariff reductions on exports\n\nB. Raw materials imported duty-free\n\nC. Exemption from customs duties\n\nD. Strict pollution regulations\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an EPZ is. From what I recall, an EPZ is a designated area within a country where goods can be imported, manufactured, and exported under more relaxed regulatory conditions compared to the rest of the country. They're often set up to attract foreign investment and boost exports.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Tariff reductions on exports\n\nI think this is a common feature of EPZs. Companies operating within these zones often benefit from reduced or eliminated tariffs on their exports. This makes their products more competitive in the global market. So, this seems like a feature.\n\nOption B: Raw materials imported duty-free\n\nThis also sounds like a benefit of EPZs. If companies can import raw materials without paying duties, that reduces their production costs, making them more competitive. So, this is likely a feature of EPZs.\n\nOption C: Exemption from customs duties\n\nThis seems broad, but EPZs are generally designed to exempt goods within them from certain customs duties. This could include both import and export duties. So, this appears to be a feature as well.\n\nOption D: Strict pollution regulations\n\nThis one seems out of place. Typically, EPZs are criticized for having looser environmental regulations to attract industries that might not meet stricter national standards. So, having strict pollution regulations doesn't align with the general characteristics of EPZs.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that. Maybe some EPZs do have strict pollution regulations, depending on the country's policies. But generally, I think EPZs are known for having less stringent environmental regulations to make them more attractive to businesses, especially those that might generate more pollution.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If I consider the primary goals of an EPZ\u2014to promote exports and attract foreign investment\u2014then policies that impose additional costs, like stricter pollution regulations, might deter potential investors. Therefore, it's less likely that EPZs would have stricter pollution regulations compared to the rest of the country.\n\nOn the other hand, some countries might implement certain environmental standards even in EPZs for sustainability reasons, but these wouldn't be \"strict\" in the sense of being more stringent than the rest of the country.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, strict pollution regulations are probably not a feature of EPZs.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any benefit to having stricter regulations in an EPZ. One possible benefit could be attracting high-tech or clean industries that require strict environmental controls. However, this seems less likely, as these industries might prefer locations with strong environmental regulations across the board.\n\nMoreover, imposing stricter regulations only in EPZs might create an uneven playing field compared to other regions in the country, which could lead to confusion or resistance from businesses.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that strict pollution regulations are not a typical feature of EPZs.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Strict pollution regulations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
