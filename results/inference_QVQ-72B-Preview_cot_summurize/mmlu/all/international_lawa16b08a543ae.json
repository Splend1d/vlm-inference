                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about extra-territorial abduction and how English courts might handle it when it comes to jurisdiction. The options are a bit confusing, so I need to break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, option A says that such abduction constitutes abuse of process and leads to a stay of proceedings. So, if there's an extra-territorial abduction, which I assume means someone is abducted from another country, and brought to England, and then proceedings are started here, the court might consider this abduction as an abuse of process and decide to stop the proceedings, aka stay them.\n\nBut wait, maybe the abduction was necessary to bring the defendant to England for trial. Maybe the person committed a crime and needed to be brought here for justice. So, is abduction always abuse, or could there be exceptions?\n\nOption B says that abduction gives rise to the abductor's liability but doesn't lead to a stay of proceedings. So, maybe the person who did the abduction can be held responsible, but the trial against the defendant still goes ahead.\n\nThat makes some sense. Why would you let the defendant off just because someone did something illegal to bring them here? The important thing is whether the defendant is guilty of the crime they're accused of, not how they got to the court.\n\nOption C says that staying proceedings in such circumstances would prevent the administration of justice in respect of international criminals. So, if you stay the proceedings because of the abduction, you're letting the bad guy go free, which isn't good, especially if they've committed serious crimes like murder or terrorism.\n\nBut is that always the case? What if the abduction was so outrageous that it taints the whole trial? Maybe the way the person was abducted was so bad that it would be unfair to try them. There has to be a balance between getting the bad guys and making sure the trial is fair.\n\nOption D says that the courts may, but will seldom, stay proceedings in cases of extra-territorial abduction. So, it's possible for the court to stay the proceedings, but it's not common. They usually proceed with the trial despite the abduction.\n\nThat seems like a middle ground. Acknowledging that abduction is bad but not letting it derail the entire trial process, especially if the evidence against the defendant is strong.\n\nNow, I need to think about which option is correct. I need to find out what the English courts actually do in such situations.\n\nI recall that there are cases where courts have had to deal with defendants who were abducted and brought to the country for trial. One famous case is the Pinochet case, but that was more about sovereign immunity and extradition.\n\nWait, no, Pinochet was about whether a former head of state could be prosecuted for acts committed while in office. Not exactly about abduction.\n\nLet me think of another case. There was a case called Autolift Ltd v. National Bank of Commerce (No.2) [1989] QB 179, where the Court of Appeal considered whether to stay proceedings on the ground of forum non conveniens, but that's not directly about abduction.\n\nMaybe I need to look at cases involving kidnapping or abduction to bring someone to England for trial.\n\nI think there was a case called R v. Bow Street Magistrates' Court, ex p. Pinochet Ugarte (No.2) [2000] 1 AC 147, but again, that was more about extradition and immunity.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at cases involving the ECHR, the European Convention on Human Rights, because abduction might violate the defendant's rights, like the right to liberty and security.\n\nThere's a case called Al-Saadoon v. United Kingdom [2010] ECHR 207, which involved the extradition of Iraqi nationals to Iraq, but that's not about abduction.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the principle of \"clean hands\" or \"unclean hands.\" If the authorities used illegal means to bring the defendant to the country, perhaps they can't benefit from that illegality by prosecuting the defendant.\n\nBut then again, if the defendant is guilty of a serious crime, shouldn't they be tried and punished?\n\nThere's a tension here between upholding the rule of law and ensuring that serious criminals are brought to justice.\n\nPerhaps the court will consider whether the abduction was necessary and proportionate, given the seriousness of the alleged crime.\n\nAlso, there might be diplomatic implications if the abduction was from another country. The home country might object to their citizen being abducted and brought to England without their consent.\n\nBut again, if the person is a dangerous criminal, maybe that takes precedence.\n\nLet me consider a hypothetical scenario: suppose someone is abducted from country X and brought to England, and then England wants to try them for a serious crime they committed in England or elsewhere.\n\nIf the crime was committed in England, then England has jurisdiction based on the territorial principle.\n\nIf the crime was committed elsewhere, then England might have jurisdiction based on other principles, like active personality (if the defendant is a British national) or passive personality (if the victim is British), or universal jurisdiction for certain international crimes like genocide.\n\nBut in any case, the abduction might be seen as an abuse of process because it's an illegal means of obtaining jurisdiction.\n\nIn English law, abuse of process is a ground for staying proceedings. The court can stay proceedings if it would be unfair to allow them to continue.\n\nSo, if the abduction was so outrageous that it would taint the trial, the court might stay the proceedings.\n\nBut, as option B suggests, the abduction might give rise to liability for the abductors, but not necessarily lead to a stay of proceedings.\n\nOption A seems to suggest that abduction is always an abuse of process leading to a stay, which might be too absolute.\n\nOption D says that courts may stay proceedings but seldom do so, implying that they usually proceed with the trial despite the abduction.\n\nOption C argues against staying proceedings because it would prevent the administration of justice for international criminals.\n\nI think that option D is the most accurate because it acknowledges that courts have the power to stay proceedings in such cases but exercise it rarely.\n\nOption A is too categorical, saying that abduction always leads to a stay, which is unlikely.\n\nOption B says that abduction gives rise to liability but doesn't lead to a stay, but perhaps in some extreme cases, it could lead to a stay.\n\nOption C is more about the policy reason against staying proceedings, but it doesn't directly answer whether courts stay proceedings or not.\n\nSo, my answer would be D: the courts may, but will seldom, stay proceedings in cases of extra-territorial abduction.\n\nI think that's the best answer based on the options provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
