                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a poll from May 1999 where 43% of high school students said they were afraid to go to school. The question is about the margin of error being 5%, and I need to choose which statement best describes what that means. The options are:\n\nA. It's likely that the true proportion of high school students afraid to go to school is between 38% and 48%.\n\nB. Five percent of the students refused to participate in the poll.\n\nC. Between 38% and 48% of those surveyed expressed fear about going to school.\n\nD. There's a 0.05 probability that the 43% result is in error.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First off, I need to understand what a margin of error means in the context of a poll. I remember that when we take a sample of a population, like a poll of high school students, the results might not perfectly represent the entire population because of sampling variability. The margin of error gives us an idea of how much the results might vary from the true population value.\n\nSo, if the poll found that 43% of students are afraid to go to school with a margin of error of 5%, that probably means that the true percentage could be anywhere from 43% minus 5% to 43% plus 5%, which is between 38% and 48%. That sounds a lot like option A: it's likely that the true proportion is between 38% and 48%.\n\nBut let's look at the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B says that five percent of the students refused to participate. That sounds like non-response bias or something, but that's not what margin of error typically refers to. Margin of error is about the precision of the estimate due to sampling, not about non-participation rates.\n\nOption C says that between 38% and 48% of those surveyed expressed fear. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. The poll found that 43% of those surveyed were afraid, with a margin of error of 5%. So, it's not that between 38% and 48% expressed fear; it's that the estimate is 43%, and the margin of error suggests how much that estimate might be off by.\n\nOption D says there's a 0.05 probability that the 43% result is in error. Hmm, that sounds a bit confusing. Margin of error is more about the range within which the true value is expected to fall, not about the probability that the result is wrong.\n\nSo, between options A and D, A seems to be the most accurate. It's expressing that the true proportion is likely within plus or minus 5% of the observed 43%, which is a common way to interpret the margin of error.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about confidence intervals. In statistics, when we talk about margin of error, we often associate it with a confidence level, like 95%. For example, we might say that we are 95% confident that the true proportion is within plus or minus 5% of the sample proportion.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't specify a confidence level, but often margins of error are given with a certain confidence level in mind, maybe 95%. Assuming that, a margin of error of 5% would mean that if the poll was repeated many times, about 95% of the sample proportions would fall within 5% of the true proportion.\n\nSo, in practical terms, it's reasonable to say that the true proportion is likely between 38% and 48%, which aligns with option A.\n\nOption B is definitely incorrect because it's referring to non-participation, which is a different issue from margin of error.\n\nOption C is misleading because it seems to suggest that within the survey itself, between 38% and 48% expressed fear, which isn't the case; the survey found exactly 43%.\n\nOption D is unclear because saying there's a 0.05 probability that the result is in error is not the same as a margin of error. Margin of error is about the precision of the estimate, not about the probability that the entire result is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option A: it's likely that the true proportion of high school students afraid to go to school is between 38% and 48%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
