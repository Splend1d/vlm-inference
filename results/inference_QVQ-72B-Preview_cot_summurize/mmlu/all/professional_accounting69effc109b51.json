                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Markson Co. trading a concrete-mixing truck with a book value of $10,000 for a cement-mixing machine valued at $11,000. The question is asking what Markson needs to know to determine if this exchange has commercial substance. The options are:\n\nA. Does the book value of the asset given up exceed the fair value of the asset received?\n\nB. Is the gain on the exchange less than the increase in future cash flows?\n\nC. Are the future cash flows expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange?\n\nD. Is the exchange nontaxable?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what \"commercial substance\" means in this context. From what I recall, an exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. So, basically, the exchange should make a real difference to the company's financial position or operations.\n\nGiven that, option C seems relevant because it directly mentions whether future cash flows are expected to change significantly due to the exchange. But let's look at each option more carefully to make sure.\n\nOption A: Does the book value of the asset given up exceed the fair value of the asset received? Hmm, in this case, the book value of the truck is $10,000, and the fair value of the cement-mixing machine is $11,000. So, no, the book value of the asset given up does not exceed the fair value received; it's less than it. But I'm not sure if that's relevant to determining commercial substance. Maybe it's related to the accounting treatment of the exchange, like recognizing a gain or loss, but that doesn't directly speak to the commercial substance.\n\nOption B: Is the gain on the exchange less than the increase in future cash flows? Well, if the exchange has commercial substance, it's because the future cash flows are expected to change significantly. So, if there's a gain on the exchange, but the future cash flows don't change much, maybe the exchange doesn't have commercial substance. But this seems a bit convoluted. I think the key is whether the future cash flows do change significantly, not necessarily how the gain relates to those changes.\n\nOption C: Are the future cash flows expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange? This seems straightforward. If the exchange leads to meaningful changes in the cash flows, like the cement-mixing machine generates more revenue or saves costs compared to the concrete-mixing truck, then the exchange has commercial substance. This aligns with the definition I recall.\n\nOption D: Is the exchange nontaxable? Tax implications are important, but they're more about the tax treatment of the exchange, not necessarily about whether the exchange affects the entity's future cash flows in a significant way. So, while tax considerations might influence the accounting treatment, they don't directly determine the commercial substance of the exchange.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C seems to be the most directly relevant to determining whether the exchange has commercial substance. It's all about whether the future cash flows are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. I remember that according to accounting standards, an exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change as a result of the exchange. So, in this case, if Markson Co. expects different cash flows from the cement-mixing machine compared to the concrete-mixing truck, then the exchange has commercial substance.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Are the future cash flows expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange?\n\nYes, that makes sense. The other options are more about the accounting or tax aspects, but they don't directly address the core concept of commercial substance, which is about the expected changes in future cash flows.\n\nSo, I think C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
