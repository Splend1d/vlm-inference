                    "text": "So I need to find the units digit of \\(7^{25}\\). Hmm, exponents can get really big, but luckily, for the units digit, I don't have to worry about all the other digits. I just need to focus on the last one.\n\nFirst, I remember that there's something called a pattern in the units digit when you raise a number to different powers. Like, for 7, if I look at the powers of 7, maybe I can see a repeating pattern in the units digit.\n\nLet me try calculating the first few powers of 7 and see what the units digits are.\n\n\\(7^1 = 7\\) \u2013 units digit is 7.\n\n\\(7^2 = 49\\) \u2013 units digit is 9.\n\n\\(7^3 = 343\\) \u2013 units digit is 3.\n\n\\(7^4 = 2401\\) \u2013 units digit is 1.\n\n\\(7^5 = 7^4 \\times 7 = 2401 \\times 7 = 16807\\) \u2013 units digit is 7.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, at \\(7^1\\), the units digit is 7; at \\(7^2\\), it's 9; at \\(7^3\\), it's 3; at \\(7^4\\), it's 1; and then at \\(7^5\\), it's back to 7. So, it seems like there's a cycle every 4 powers: 7, 9, 3, 1, and then it repeats.\n\nSo, the pattern repeats every 4 exponents.\n\nNow, I need to find the units digit of \\(7^{25}\\). Since the pattern repeats every 4 exponents, I can find where 25 falls in this cycle.\n\nTo do that, I can divide 25 by 4 and see what the remainder is.\n\n\\(25 \\div 4 = 6\\) with a remainder of 1.\n\nSo, 25 divided by 4 is 6 with a remainder of 1. That means the units digit of \\(7^{25}\\) is the same as the units digit of \\(7^{1}\\), which is 7.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that.\n\nLet's see:\n\n\\(7^1 = 7\\)\n\n\\(7^2 = 49\\)\n\n\\(7^3 = 343\\)\n\n\\(7^4 = 2401\\)\n\n\\(7^5 = 16807\\)\n\n\\(7^6 = 117649\\) \u2013 units digit 9.\n\n\\(7^7 = 823543\\) \u2013 units digit 3.\n\n\\(7^8 = 5764801\\) \u2013 units digit 1.\n\n\\(7^9 = 40353607\\) \u2013 units digit 7.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, indeed, every 4 exponents, the pattern repeats: 7, 9, 3, 1, and then back to 7.\n\nTherefore, since 25 divided by 4 gives a remainder of 1, the units digit should be the same as that of \\(7^1\\), which is 7.\n\nWait a minute, but what if the remainder was 0? Let's say for \\(7^{4}\\), which is 2401, the units digit is 1. So, when the exponent is divisible by 4, like \\(7^{4}\\), the units digit is 1.\n\nSimilarly, for \\(7^{5}\\), which is \\(7^{4+1}\\), it's back to 7.\n\nSo, in general, the units digit of \\(7^{n}\\) can be found by looking at \\(n\\) modulo 4.\n\n- If \\(n \\mod 4 = 1\\), units digit is 7.\n\n- If \\(n \\mod 4 = 2\\), units digit is 9.\n\n- If \\(n \\mod 4 = 3\\), units digit is 3.\n\n- If \\(n \\mod 4 = 0\\), units digit is 1.\n\nGiven that, for \\(n = 25\\), \\(25 \\mod 4 = 1\\), so the units digit should be 7.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other way to approach this problem?\n\nAnother way I've heard of is using Euler's theorem, which says that if two numbers are coprime, then \\(a^{\\phi(m)} \\equiv 1 \\mod m\\), where \\(\\phi(m)\\) is Euler's totient function.\n\nBut in this case, I'm dealing with the units digit, which is essentially finding \\(7^{n} \\mod 10\\).\n\nActually, Euler's theorem can be applied here. Since 7 and 10 are coprime, and \\(\\phi(10) = 4\\), then \\(7^{4} \\equiv 1 \\mod 10\\).\n\nSo, \\(7^{24} = (7^{4})^{6} \\equiv 1^{6} = 1 \\mod 10\\).\n\nThen, \\(7^{25} = 7^{24} \\times 7^{1} \\equiv 1 \\times 7 = 7 \\mod 10\\).\n\nSo, this confirms that the units digit is 7.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of cyclicity of units digits in powers, which is what I did earlier.\n\nAnother way is to use binomial expansion or look for patterns in the powers, but given the time constraints, maybe that's not the most efficient approach.\n\nAlso, I could consider that \\(7 \\equiv -3 \\mod 10\\), so \\(7^{n} \\equiv (-3)^{n} \\mod 10\\), and then look at the pattern of \\((-3)^{n}\\) modulo 10.\n\nLet's try that:\n\n\\((-3)^1 = -3 \\equiv 7 \\mod 10\\)\n\n\\((-3)^2 = 9 \\equiv 9 \\mod 10\\)\n\n\\((-3)^3 = -27 \\equiv 3 \\mod 10\\)\n\n\\((-3)^4 = 81 \\equiv 1 \\mod 10\\)\n\n\\((-3)^5 = -243 \\equiv 7 \\mod 10\\)\n\nAnd so on, which is the same pattern as before: 7, 9, 3, 1, repeating every 4.\n\nSo, again, \\(7^{25} \\equiv (-3)^{25} \\mod 10\\).\n\nNow, 25 divided by 4 is 6 with a remainder of 1, so \\((-3)^{25} \\equiv (-3)^{1} \\equiv -3 \\equiv 7 \\mod 10\\).\n\nThis again confirms that the units digit is 7.\n\nI think I've approached this problem from a few different angles and consistently arrived at the same answer. So, I'm fairly confident that the units digit of \\(7^{25}\\) is 7.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1\n\nB. 3\n\nC. 5\n\nD. 7\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
