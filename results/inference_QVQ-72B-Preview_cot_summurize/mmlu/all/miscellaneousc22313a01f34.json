                    "text": "So I have this question: \"Which company holds an annual self-named 'Bake-Off'?\" And the options are A. Betty Crocker, B. Duncan Hines, C. Pillsbury, D. Keebler. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these companies organizes a yearly baking competition that shares its name with the company itself.\n\nFirst off, I know that a \"Bake-Off\" is a competition where people submit their baked goods to be judged, usually for prizes or recognition. It's a pretty common event, especially around holiday seasons or in baking communities. But in this case, it's specifically an annual event that's named after the company itself.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with A. Betty Crocker. I know Betty Crocker is a brand known for its baking mixes and frostings. They have been around for a long time and are famous for their mascot, the red-haired woman in a white dress. I recall that they do have baking contests, but I'm not sure if it's annual or if it's self-named as the \"Betty Crocker Bake-Off.\"\n\nMoving on to B. Duncan Hines. Duncan Hines is another baking brand, primarily known for their cake mixes and frostings. They also have a history that goes back quite a ways. I think they might have some baking competitions, but again, I'm not sure about the specifics of whether they hold an annual \"Duncan Hines Bake-Off.\"\n\nNext is C. Pillsbury. Pillsbury is famous for their doughboy logo and their ready-to-bake products like biscuits and cookies. I seem to remember that Pillsbury has a big baking contest, maybe even called the \"Pillsbury Bake-Off.\" Let me try to recall more details about that.\n\nLastly, D. Keebler. Keebler is known for their cookies and crackers, like Elf Cookies and Town House Crackers. I don't recall them having a major baking competition, but I could be wrong.\n\nLet me focus on Pillsbury since that seems like a strong candidate. I think the Pillsbury Bake-Off is a well-known event where people submit recipes using Pillsbury products, and there are categories for different types of baked goods. I believe it's been going on for many years and is quite popular.\n\nTo make sure I'm not mixing it up with another competition, let me consider if any of the other companies also have a similar event.\n\nBetty Crocker, as far as I know, has baking contests but maybe not an annual one with the same name. I might be mistaken, but I don't think their main baking competition is called the \"Betty Crocker Bake-Off.\"\n\nDuncan Hines, I'm less familiar with their specific baking events. I know they sponsor baking recipes and perhaps some local competitions, but nothing as prominent as an annual self-named bake-off.\n\nKeebler, while they make cookies, which are a type of baked good, I don't recall them having a major baking competition. Their marketing seems more focused on the convenience and taste of their ready-made cookies and crackers rather than encouraging homemade baking.\n\nTherefore, based on my knowledge, Pillsbury seems to be the company that holds an annual self-named 'Bake-Off.' So, the answer should be C. Pillsbury.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll see if I can recall any details about the Pillsbury Bake-Off. I think it's been around since the 1940s or 1950s, and it's a national competition with significant prizes. Winners often become famous for their recipes, like the Sticky Bun or the Quick Bread category. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nSo, I'm confident that Pillsbury is the correct answer to this question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Pillsbury}} \\]"
