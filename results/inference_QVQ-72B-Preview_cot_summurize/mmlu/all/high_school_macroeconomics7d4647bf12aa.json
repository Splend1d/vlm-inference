                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand how monetary policy works during a recession. The question is about expansionary monetary policy in such a scenario. Let's see what each option says.\n\nOption A says that expansionary monetary policy is designed to decrease aggregate demand so that real prices will decrease, which is good for the economy. Hmm, I thought expansionary monetary policy was meant to stimulate the economy by increasing aggregate demand, not decreasing it. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nOption B suggests that expansionary monetary policy increases aggregate demand, which in turn increases real output and employment. That sounds more familiar. I remember learning that during a recession, when output is below potential, central banks might cut interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending, thereby increasing aggregate demand.\n\nOption C mentions that expansionary monetary policy increases unemployment but low prices negate this effect. Wait, I thought expansionary monetary policy was supposed to reduce unemployment by stimulating the economy. Why would it increase unemployment? And how do low prices negate that effect? This seems confusing.\n\nOption D says that expansionary monetary policy keeps interest rates high to attract foreign investment. But I thought expansionary monetary policy typically involves lowering interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending. How would that attract foreign investment? Maybe there's something I don't understand here.\n\nLet me try to recall the basic principles of monetary policy. In a recession, the central bank usually lowers interest rates to make borrowing cheaper, hoping that businesses and consumers will borrow more and spend more, thus increasing aggregate demand. This increased spending can help close the recessionary gap by increasing output and employment.\n\nSo, according to this, option B seems to align with this explanation. But let's double-check each option more carefully.\n\nStarting with option A: It says expansionary monetary policy decreases aggregate demand to decrease real prices. But actually, expansionary monetary policy is intended to increase aggregate demand, not decrease it. Decreasing aggregate demand would typically be a contractionary policy to fight inflation. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption B: Increase aggregate demand, which leads to increased real output and employment. This matches what I learned about expansionary monetary policy. It's designed to stimulate the economy during a downturn by boosting spending and production.\n\nOption C: Increase unemployment but low prices negate this effect. This doesn't make much sense. If anything, expansionary monetary policy is supposed to decrease unemployment by stimulating economic activity. Maybe it's referring to the trade-off between inflation and unemployment, but it's phrased confusingly.\n\nOption D: Keep interest rates high to attract foreign investment. But expansionary monetary policy typically involves lowering interest rates, not keeping them high. Higher interest rates are usually associated with contractionary policy to cool down the economy and fight inflation.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option B seems to be the correct answer. It accurately describes the purpose of expansionary monetary policy in a recession: to increase aggregate demand, thereby increasing real output and employment.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any chance that another option could be correct in certain circumstances.\n\nFor option A: Perhaps in some cases, decreasing aggregate demand could lead to lower prices, but that wouldn't be the goal during a recession when prices might already be falling or stable. During a recession, the concern is more about insufficient demand and underutilized capacity, not about high prices.\n\nFor option C: Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. If expansionary monetary policy leads to higher inflation, that could potentially lead to higher nominal wages, which might create disincentives for employment in certain sectors. But this seems like a stretch, and it's not the primary or intended effect of such a policy.\n\nFor option D: Attracting foreign investment can be beneficial, but it's not the main objective of expansionary monetary policy. Moreover, lower interest rates might actually make the currency less attractive to foreign investors, leading to a decrease in demand for the currency and potentially a depreciation in its value.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option B is the correct answer. Expansionary monetary policy in a recession is designed to increase aggregate demand, which in turn increases real output and employment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
