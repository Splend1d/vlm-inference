                    "text": "I'm here to tackle these two statements about group theory in abstract algebra. I have to determine whether each statement is true or false, and then match them to the given options. Let's take them one at a time.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: \"A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian.\"\n\nOkay, so I need to think about factor groups and non-Abelian groups. First off, a non-Abelian group is a group where the group operation isn't necessarily commutative. That means there are elements a and b in the group such that a * b \u2260 b * a.\n\nA factor group, or quotient group, is formed when you take a group and divide it by a normal subgroup. The elements of the factor group are cosets of that normal subgroup.\n\nSo, the question is asking whether, if I start with a non-Abelian group and take a factor group by some normal subgroup, that factor group must also be non-Abelian.\n\nHmm, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look for an example where this isn't the case.\n\nLet me consider the symmetric group S3, which is non-Abelian. It has six elements: the identity, two 3-cycles, and three transpositions.\n\nNow, if I take a normal subgroup of S3, say the alternating group A3, which has three elements: the identity and the three 3-cycles.\n\nThen, the factor group S3 / A3 would have two cosets: A3 itself and the set containing the three transpositions.\n\nSo, the factor group has two elements. Is this factor group Abelian or non-Abelian?\n\nWell, a group with two elements is cyclic and therefore Abelian. So, in this case, the factor group is Abelian, even though S3 is non-Abelian.\n\nWait a minute, does this mean that Statement 1 is false?\n\nBecause, in this example, starting with a non-Abelian group S3 and taking a factor group by a normal subgroup A3, the resulting factor group is actually Abelian.\n\nSo, this would be a counterexample to the statement.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if there are other cases where the factor group could be non-Abelian.\n\nFor example, consider the dihedral group D4, which is non-Abelian, and has eight elements, representing the symmetries of a square.\n\nIf I take a normal subgroup, say the subgroup generated by a 180-degree rotation, which is {identity, r^2}, where r is the rotation by 90 degrees.\n\nThen, the factor group D4 / {1, r^2} would have four cosets, corresponding to the reflections and rotations not in the subgroup.\n\nIs this factor group Abelian or non-Abelian?\n\nLet me think about the operation in the factor group.\n\nIn D4, the operation is composition of symmetries, and in the factor group, we're effectively setting r^2 to the identity.\n\nSo, the factor group would have elements like {reflection}, {r}, {r^3}, and {1, r^2}.\n\nWait, actually, in D4, the subgroup {1, r^2} is normal, and the factor group is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, which is Abelian.\n\nAgain, starting from a non-Abelian group, the factor group is Abelian.\n\nAnother example: take the quaternion group Q8, which is non-Abelian, and has eight elements.\n\nIf I take the center of Q8, which is {1, -1}, and form the factor group Q8 / {1, -1}, what do I get?\n\nThe factor group has four elements, and it's isomorphic to the Klein four-group, which is Abelian.\n\nAgain, the factor group is Abelian.\n\nSo, in these examples, starting with non-Abelian groups and taking factor groups by normal subgroups results in Abelian factor groups.\n\nTherefore, it's not always the case that a factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian.\n\nHence, Statement 1 is false.\n\nNow, moving on to Statement 2: \"If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\"\n\nThis is a statement about the transitivity of normality in group theory.\n\nI recall that normality is not generally transitive. That is, just because K is normal in H and H is normal in G, it doesn't necessarily mean that K is normal in G.\n\nLet me try to find a counterexample to see if this statement is false.\n\nConsider G to be the symmetric group S4, which has the Klein four-group V as a normal subgroup (since V is the kernel of the sign homomorphism from S4 to Z2).\n\nNow, within V, take K to be the subgroup {1, (12)(34)}.\n\nIs K normal in V?\n\nV has four elements: {1, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)}.\n\nSince V is Abelian, every subgroup is normal. So, K is normal in V.\n\nNow, is K normal in G = S4?\n\nWell, S4 has many subgroups, and K is a subgroup of V, which is a subgroup of S4.\n\nBut is K normal in S4?\n\nTo check if K is normal in G, I need to see if for every g in G and every k in K, gkg^{-1} is in K.\n\nBut S4 is non-Abelian, and K is not a normal subgroup of S4.\n\nFor example, take g = (123), which is in S4 but not in V, and k = (12)(34) from K.\n\nCompute gkg^{-1} = (123)(12)(34)(132) = (13)(24), which is in V but not in K.\n\nTherefore, K is not normal in G.\n\nSo, in this case, K is normal in H (where H is V), and H is normal in G (G is S4), but K is not normal in G.\n\nThis serves as a counterexample to Statement 2.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nWait a second, but I need to make sure that H is indeed normal in G in this setup.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, V is normal in S4 because it's the kernel of the sign homomorphism from S4 to Z2, which is a surjective homomorphism, and kernels of surjective homomorphisms are normal subgroups.\n\nSo, yes, V is normal in S4.\n\nTherefore, the counterexample holds, and Statement 2 is false.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another example.\n\nTake G to be the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4, say G = Z4 \u00d7 Z4.\n\nLet H be a subgroup of G, say H = <(2,0)>, which is normal in G because G is Abelian.\n\nNow, take K to be a subgroup of H, say K = {(0,0), (2,0)}.\n\nIs K normal in G?\n\nSince G is Abelian, every subgroup is normal, so K is normal in G.\n\nSimilarly, H is normal in G.\n\nBut in this case, K is normal in H and H is normal in G, and K is also normal in G.\n\nHowever, this doesn't disprove the statement; it just shows that in this particular Abelian group, normality is transitive.\n\nBut since we already have a counterexample from S4, we can conclude that Statement 2 is false in general.\n\nTherefore, both statements are false.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct choice is B. False, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
