                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a proton that's initially at rest and then accelerated through a potential difference V, giving it a velocity in the +z-direction. It then enters a region where there's a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction. But interestingly, the proton's trajectory isn't affected in this region. Then, the question asks what would happen if we repeat the experiment but with a potential difference of 2V.\n\nFirst, I need to understand why the proton's trajectory isn't affected in the first scenario. When a charged particle moves through regions with electric and magnetic fields, it experiences forces due to these fields. The electric force is given by \\( \\vec{F}_E = q \\vec{E} \\), and the magnetic force is \\( \\vec{F}_B = q \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} \\), where \\( q \\) is the charge, \\( \\vec{E} \\) is the electric field, \\( \\vec{v} \\) is the velocity, and \\( \\vec{B} \\) is the magnetic field.\n\nGiven that the proton is moving in the +z-direction, its velocity \\( \\vec{v} \\) is in the +z-direction. The magnetic field \\( \\vec{B} \\) is in the +y-direction. So, the cross product \\( \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} \\) will be in the direction given by the right-hand rule. If I point my right thumb in the direction of \\( \\vec{v} \\) (+z-direction) and my fingers in the direction of \\( \\vec{B} \\) (+y-direction), my palm will face in the +x-direction. Therefore, the magnetic force \\( \\vec{F}_B \\) is in the +x-direction.\n\nMeanwhile, the electric field \\( \\vec{E} \\) is in the +x-direction, so the electric force \\( \\vec{F}_E \\) is also in the +x-direction.\n\nSo, both the electric and magnetic forces are acting in the +x-direction. If the proton's trajectory isn't affected, that means the net force in the +x-direction must be zero. Therefore, there must be another force acting in the -x-direction to balance these forces.\n\nBut wait, what could that force be? The only forces present are the electric and magnetic forces, both in the +x-direction. So, for the net force to be zero, perhaps the proton is moving at a specific velocity where \\( qE = qvB \\), meaning \\( v = E/B \\). That makes sense; at this velocity, the electric and magnetic forces cancel each other out, resulting in no net force and thus no deflection.\n\nNow, if we repeat the experiment with a potential difference of 2V, we need to find out how the proton's velocity changes and what effect that has on the forces acting on it.\n\nFirst, let's recall that when a particle is accelerated from rest through a potential difference V, it gains kinetic energy equal to qV, where q is the charge of the particle. For a proton, q = e, the elementary charge.\n\nSo, the kinetic energy \\( K = qV \\), and since \\( K = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2 \\), we have:\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{2} mv^2 = qV \\)\n\nThus, \\( v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2qV}{m}} \\)\n\nIf we double the potential difference to 2V, the velocity becomes:\n\n\\( v' = \\sqrt{\\frac{2q(2V)}{m}} = \\sqrt{2} v \\)\n\nSo, the new velocity is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) times the original velocity.\n\nNow, going back to the forces:\n\n- The electric force \\( F_E = qE \\), which is independent of velocity.\n\n- The magnetic force \\( F_B = qvB \\), which is proportional to velocity.\n\nOriginally, at velocity \\( v \\), \\( F_E = F_B \\), so \\( qE = qvB \\), which simplifies to \\( E = vB \\).\n\nNow, with the new velocity \\( v' = \\sqrt{2} v \\), the magnetic force becomes:\n\n\\( F_B' = qv'B = q(\\sqrt{2} v)B = \\sqrt{2} qvB \\)\n\nSince \\( qE = qvB \\), then \\( F_B' = \\sqrt{2} qvB = \\sqrt{2} qE \\)\n\nTherefore, the net force in the x-direction is:\n\n\\( F_{net} = F_E - F_B' = qE - \\sqrt{2} qE = qE (1 - \\sqrt{2}) \\)\n\nSince \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) is approximately 1.414, \\( 1 - \\sqrt{2} \\) is negative, meaning the net force is in the -x-direction.\n\nTherefore, the proton would be deflected in the -x-direction.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If \\( F_B' = \\sqrt{2} qE \\) and \\( F_E = qE \\), then indeed \\( F_{net} = qE - \\sqrt{2} qE = qE (1 - \\sqrt{2}) \\), which is negative, indicating the force is in the -x-direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to look at it. Let's consider the condition for no deflection initially:\n\n\\( F_E = F_B \\)\n\n\\( qE = qvB \\)\n\n\\( E = vB \\)\n\nNow, if \\( v \\) increases to \\( v' = \\sqrt{2} v \\), then \\( F_B' = qv'B = q(\\sqrt{2} v)B = \\sqrt{2} qvB = \\sqrt{2} qE \\)\n\nThus, \\( F_B' > F_E \\), meaning the magnetic force is stronger in the +x-direction compared to the electric force in the +x-direction. Therefore, the net force is in the direction of the larger force, which is +x-direction. But wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n\nHold on, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. Let's think again.\n\nThe electric force is always in the +x-direction, and the magnetic force is also in the +x-direction, as established earlier. If the velocity increases by \\( \\sqrt{2} \\), the magnetic force increases by \\( \\sqrt{2} \\), making it larger than the electric force. Therefore, the net force is in the +x-direction, not -x-direction.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the net force was negative. That was a mistake. Since both forces are in the +x-direction, and \\( F_B' > F_E \\), the net force should be in the +x-direction, but the question states that in the original scenario, the trajectory isn't affected, meaning \\( F_E = F_B \\). If \\( F_B' > F_E \\), then the proton should be deflected in the +x-direction.\n\nHowever, the answer options suggest it could be deflected in either +x or -x direction, or +y or -y direction. But according to my reasoning, it should be deflected in the +x-direction.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the direction of the forces again. The electric force is in the +x-direction, and the magnetic force is also in the +x-direction. If \\( F_B' > F_E \\), then the net force is in the +x-direction, leading to deflection in the +x-direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's something I'm missing. Let's consider the forces again.\n\nGiven that \\( E = vB \\) for no deflection, and now \\( v' = \\sqrt{2} v \\), so \\( E = \\frac{v'}{\\sqrt{2}} B \\). Therefore, \\( F_E = qE = q \\frac{v'}{\\sqrt{2}} B \\), and \\( F_B' = q v' B = q v' B \\).\n\nSo, \\( F_{net} = F_E + F_B' = q \\frac{v'}{\\sqrt{2}} B + q v' B = q v' B \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + 1 \\right) \\), which is positive, meaning in the +x-direction.\n\nTherefore, the proton should be deflected in the +x-direction.\n\nBut the answer options include deflection in the -x-direction, which contradicts my reasoning. Maybe I need to look at it differently.\n\nLet me consider the Lorentz force law:\n\n\\( \\vec{F} = q \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + q \\vec{E} \\)\n\nIn the original scenario, \\( \\vec{v} \\) is in +z, \\( \\vec{B} \\) is in +y, so \\( \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} \\) is in +x (right-hand rule), and \\( \\vec{E} \\) is in +x. So, both terms are in +x-direction.\n\nFor no deflection, their sum must be zero, which we've established at \\( v = E/B \\).\n\nNow, if \\( v' = \\sqrt{2} v \\), then \\( \\vec{F}' = q v' \\times \\vec{B} + q \\vec{E} = q (\\sqrt{2} v) \\times \\vec{B} + q \\vec{E} \\)\n\nGiven that \\( q v \\times \\vec{B} = -q \\vec{E} \\) (since \\( v = E/B \\)), then \\( q (\\sqrt{2} v) \\times \\vec{B} = \\sqrt{2} q v \\times \\vec{B} = -\\sqrt{2} q \\vec{E} \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( \\vec{F}' = -\\sqrt{2} q \\vec{E} + q \\vec{E} = q \\vec{E} (1 - \\sqrt{2}) \\), which is negative, meaning in the -x-direction.\n\nAh, now I see the mistake in my earlier reasoning. I incorrectly added the forces when they are supposed to balance each other at \\( v = E/B \\). When \\( v' = \\sqrt{2} v \\), the magnetic force component changes, and the net force becomes \\( q \\vec{E} (1 - \\sqrt{2}) \\), which is indeed in the -x-direction because \\( 1 - \\sqrt{2} \\) is negative.\n\nTherefore, the proton would be deflected in the -x-direction.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about it in terms of energy and forces.\n\nInitially, at \\( v = E/B \\), the electric and magnetic forces balance, so no deflection.\n\nWhen \\( v' = \\sqrt{2} v \\), the magnetic force increases to \\( q v' B = q \\sqrt{2} v B = \\sqrt{2} q E \\), while the electric force remains \\( q E \\).\n\nTherefore, the net force is \\( q E - \\sqrt{2} q E = q E (1 - \\sqrt{2}) \\), which is negative, meaning in the -x-direction.\n\nThus, the proton is deflected in the -x-direction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
