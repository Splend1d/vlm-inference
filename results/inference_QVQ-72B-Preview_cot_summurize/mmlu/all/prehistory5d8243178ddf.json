                    "text": "So I've got this question here about stone blades, specifically one that's fluted on both faces and is associated with extinct elephants. The options are Thule, Lapita, Dorset, and Clovis. Hmm, I need to recall which of these cultures or groups is known for making fluted stone blades, especially ones linked to extinct elephants.\n\nFirst off, let's think about what a fluted point is. It's a type of stone tool where pressure is applied to create a channel or flute along the length of the blade. This fluting was likely done to make the point lighter and possibly easier to haft onto a spear or dart. Now, the fact that it's fluted on both faces suggests it's a bilateral fluted point.\n\nNext, the mention of extinct elephants makes me think of prehistoric times, probably during the last Ice Age when mammoths and other large mammals roamed the Earth. Many indigenous peoples have histories connected to hunting or interacting with these now-extinct animals.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nA. Thule: The Thule culture is known for being a late prehistoric culture in the Arctic, primarily associated with the Inuit people. They were excellent hunters, especially of marine mammals like whales. However, I don't recall them being directly associated with extinct elephants. Mammoths were already extinct by the time the Thule culture emerged, so it's unlikely that they made tools specifically linked to them.\n\nB. Lapita: Lapita is a cultural complex known from the Pacific Islands, particularly in Melanesia and Polynesia. Their pottery is famous for its intricate designs. While they did produce stone tools, I don't remember fluted stone blades being among them. Also, their timeline and location don't align with the presence of extinct elephants, as these animals were primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia during the Ice Age.\n\nC. Dorset: The Dorset culture was another Paleo-Eskimo culture that existed in the Arctic and Subarctic regions of North America. They were contemporaries of the Thule people but had their own distinct traditions. Again, while they were skilled toolmakers, I don't associate them directly with fluted stone blades or with extinct elephants, as these animals were already gone by their time.\n\nD. Clovis: Now, Clovis is a name that rings a bell in the context of prehistoric North America. The Clovis culture is one of the earliest widely recognized cultures in the New World, dating back to around 13,000 years ago. They are famous for their distinctive fluted stone spear points, which are characterized by their bilateral fluting\u2014meaning flutes on both sides. These points are often found in association with the remains of large game, including various species of extinct elephants like mammoths and mastodons.\n\nPutting it all together, the Clovis culture seems to fit the description perfectly. They were known for making fluted stone blades on both faces, and they coexisted with and hunted extinct elephants during the Ice Age.\n\nJust to double-check, I can recall that Clovis points are a key artifact in the study of the early human colonization of the Americas. Their fluted design was likely an innovation that made their projectile points more efficient for hunting large game. The fluting would have made the points lighter without sacrificing strength, and perhaps even helped them penetrate better.\n\nSo, based on this information, the correct answer should be D. Clovis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Clovis}} \\]"
