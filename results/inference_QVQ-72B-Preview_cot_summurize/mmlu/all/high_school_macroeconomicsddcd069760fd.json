                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem about banking and reserves. So, the bank has $500 in checking deposits, and it's required to reserve $50. I need to find the reserve ratio and the amount in excess reserves. The options are given, but I want to understand how to calculate this.\n\nFirst, what's the reserve ratio? I think it's the percentage of deposits that the bank has to keep as reserves. So, if the bank has $500 in deposits and has to reserve $50, the reserve ratio should be $50 divided by $500, right? Let's do that math.\n\n$50 divided by $500 is 0.10, which is 10%. So, the reserve ratio is 10%. Okay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow, what about excess reserves? Excess reserves are the funds that the bank has beyond what it's required to hold as reserves. So, if the required reserves are $50, and the bank has more than that, the difference would be excess reserves.\n\nBut in this problem, it only says the bank has $500 in checking deposits and is required to reserve $50. It doesn't specify if the bank has any additional reserves. So, if the required reserves are $50, and the bank has exactly $50 in reserves, then excess reserves would be zero, right?\n\nWait a minute, but maybe I'm missing something. Maybe the bank has more reserves than required. Let's see.\n\nThe problem says the bank is required to reserve $50, but it doesn't specify how much total reserves the bank actually holds. It only mentions the required reserves. So, perhaps the bank has only $50 in reserves, which would mean no excess reserves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total reserves are more than $50. But the problem doesn't say that. It just says the required reserves are $50. Hmm.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 10 percent, $450 in excess reserves\n\nB. 90 percent, $50 in excess reserves\n\nC. 90 percent, $450 in excess reserves\n\nD. 10 percent, $50 in excess reserves\n\nBased on my calculation, the reserve ratio is 10%, so options A and D have 10%, while B and C have 90%. So, between A and D, which one is correct?\n\nI calculated the reserve ratio as 10%, so options A and D are possible. Now, regarding excess reserves.\n\nIf the required reserves are $50, and the bank has exactly $50 in reserves, then excess reserves are zero. But option A says $450 in excess reserves, and option D says $50 in excess reserves.\n\nBut wait, if the bank has $500 in deposits and the reserve ratio is 10%, then required reserves are $50, as given. If the bank has only $50 in reserves, then excess reserves are zero. But option A suggests $450 in excess reserves, which doesn't make sense unless the bank has more reserves than required.\n\nUnless the bank has total reserves of $500, and required reserves are $50, then excess reserves would be $500 - $50 = $450. But the problem doesn't specify that the bank has $500 in total reserves.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the bank's total reserves include both required and excess reserves.\n\nGiven that, if required reserves are $50, and total reserves are $500, then excess reserves would be $500 - $50 = $450, which matches option A.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because typically, banks hold reserves equal to the required amount, and any additional reserves are considered excess.\n\nBut in this case, if the bank has $500 in deposits and is required to hold $50 in reserves, but actually holds $500 in reserves, then excess reserves would indeed be $450.\n\nWait, but that seems off. Let me think differently.\n\nMaybe the bank's total reserves are $500, and required reserves are $50, so excess reserves are $450. That would align with option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the $500 is only the checking deposits, and total reserves are less.\n\nBut the problem specifically says the bank has $500 in checking deposits and is required to reserve $50. It doesn't specify total reserves, only required reserves.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to recall the formula for required reserves.\n\nRequired reserves = reserve ratio \u00d7 total deposits\n\nGiven that, if required reserves are $50, and total deposits are $500, then reserve ratio is $50 / $500 = 10%, which matches option A and D.\n\nBut option A says $450 in excess reserves, while option D says $50 in excess reserves.\n\nGiven that, and without more information, I would think that if the bank has $50 in reserves (which are required), then excess reserves are zero.\n\nBut option A suggests $450 in excess reserves, which would require the bank to have total reserves of $500, with $50 required and $450 excess.\n\nUnless the $500 is total reserves, not deposits. But the problem says $500 in checking deposits.\n\nI think I'm misinterpreting something here.\n\nLet me recall that deposits are the funds that customers have in their accounts, and reserves are the funds that the bank keeps to back up those deposits.\n\nThe reserve ratio dictates how much of the deposits must be kept in reserves.\n\nSo, if deposits are $500, and the reserve ratio is 10%, then required reserves are $50.\n\nIf the bank has exactly $50 in reserves, then excess reserves are zero.\n\nBut if the bank has more than $50 in reserves, say $500, then excess reserves are $450.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the total reserves, only the required reserves.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to assume that the bank holds the required reserves plus some excess.\n\nBut without knowing the total reserves, it's hard to determine excess reserves.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 10 percent, $450 in excess reserves\n\nB. 90 percent, $50 in excess reserves\n\nC. 90 percent, $450 in excess reserves\n\nD. 10 percent, $50 in excess reserves\n\nGiven that the reserve ratio is 10%, options A and D are possible.\n\nBut option A suggests $450 in excess reserves, which would require total reserves of $500 (deposits) * 10% (reserve ratio) = $50 required reserves, and thus $500 - $50 = $450 excess reserves.\n\nBut the problem says the bank is required to reserve $50, but doesn't specify if it holds more than that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $500 in checking deposits are part of the reserves.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that the bank's total reserves include both required and excess reserves.\n\nIf that's the case, and required reserves are $50, and total reserves are $500, then excess reserves are $500 - $50 = $450, which matches option A.\n\nAlternatively, if the bank has $500 in deposits and holds $50 in reserves, then excess reserves are zero.\n\nBut option A suggests the bank has $450 in excess reserves, which would only be possible if total reserves are $500.\n\nPerhaps the $500 includes both required and excess reserves.\n\nThis is still unclear. Maybe I need to look at it differently.\n\nLet me consider that the bank has $500 in checking deposits, and is required to hold 10% in reserves, which is $50.\n\nIf the bank holds exactly $50 in reserves, then excess reserves are zero.\n\nBut if the bank holds more than $50 in reserves, say $500, then excess reserves are $450.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options, option A seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bank's total reserves are $500, and required reserves are $50, so excess reserves are $450.\n\nBut without explicit information about total reserves, it's hard to be certain.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options provided, I'll go with option A: 10 percent, $450 in excess reserves.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
