                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have Kanji Company with sales last year of $265 million, and among these sales, there were cash sales of $25 million. That means not all sales were on credit; some were cash transactions. The average collection period is given as 36 days, and we're supposed to find the ending accounts receivable balance from the provided options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what accounts receivable represent. Accounts receivable are amounts due from customers for goods or services sold on credit. So, if some sales are cash and some are credit, the accounts receivable would be related only to the credit sales.\n\nGiven that, I should probably find the credit sales first. Total sales are $265 million, and cash sales are $25 million. So, credit sales would be total sales minus cash sales.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nCredit sales = total sales - cash sales = $265 million - $25 million = $240 million.\n\nOkay, so credit sales are $240 million.\n\nNow, the average collection period (ACP) is the average number of days it takes for a company to receive payment from its customers for its credit sales. It's given as 36 days. We're assuming a 365-day year.\n\nThe formula to calculate the average collection period is:\n\n\\[ \\text{ACP} = \\frac{\\text{accounts receivable} \\times 365}{\\text{credit sales}} \\]\n\nWe need to solve for accounts receivable (A/R):\n\n\\[ \\text{A/R} = \\frac{\\text{ACP} \\times \\text{credit sales}}{365} \\]\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n\\[ \\text{A/R} = \\frac{36 \\times \\$240 \\text{ million}}{365} \\]\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 36 times $240 million:\n\n\\[ 36 \\times 240 = 8640 \\]\n\nSo, $8640 million.\n\nThen, divide by 365:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\$8640 \\text{ million}}{365} \\approx \\$23.67 \\text{ million} \\]\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $26.1 million\n\nB. $23.7 million\n\nC. $7.4 million\n\nD. $18.7 million\n\n$23.67 million is closest to option B. $23.7 million.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, credit sales are indeed $265 million total sales minus $25 million cash sales, which is $240 million. That seems correct.\n\nThen, the formula for ACP is correct: ACP = (A/R * 365) / credit sales.\n\nSolving for A/R: A/R = (ACP * credit sales) / 365.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: 36 * $240 million / 365.\n\nCalculating 36 * 240 = 8640.\n\nThen 8640 / 365 = approximately 23.67 million.\n\nYes, that seems accurate.\n\nSo, the ending accounts receivable balance is closest to $23.7 million, which is option B.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the accounts receivable balance.\n\nFor example, did the company have any bad debts or write-offs during the year? The problem doesn't mention any bad debts, so I assume that the accounts receivable balance consists only of the amounts expected to be collected.\n\nAlso, the problem states that the average collection period is 36 days, which is likely the company's experience or policy, and we're to use that to find the ending A/R balance.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the daily credit sales and multiply by the ACP to get the A/R balance.\n\nDaily credit sales would be credit sales divided by 365 days:\n\n\\[ \\text{daily credit sales} = \\frac{\\$240 \\text{ million}}{365} \\approx \\$657,534.25 \\]\n\nThen, A/R balance = daily credit sales * ACP\n\n\\[ \\text{A/R} = \\$657,534.25 \\times 36 = \\$23.67 \\text{ million} \\]\n\nThis confirms the previous result.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. $23.7 million.\n\nJust to make sure, let's see what the other options might represent.\n\nOption A. $26.1 million: This might be a miscalculation, perhaps using total sales instead of credit sales.\n\nOption C. $7.4 million: This seems too low and might be a result of using the wrong formula or incorrect days.\n\nOption D. $18.7 million: This might be another miscalculation, perhaps using a different ACP or sales figure.\n\nBut based on the calculations, option B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
