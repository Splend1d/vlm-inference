                    "text": "So I've got this question here about acid ionization. It says that one mole of each of these compounds\u2014HNO2, HClO4, H2S, and H3PO4\u2014is dissolved in water, resulting in solutions with different pH values. And I need to figure out which of these acids will have the highest percentage ionization under those conditions.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what ionization means in the context of acids. When an acid dissolves in water, it donates protons (H+) to the solution, and the extent to which it does this is related to its strength. Strong acids ionize completely, meaning almost all the acid molecules give up their protons, while weak acids only partially ionize.\n\nThe percentage ionization is essentially how much of the acid has given up its protons to form H+ ions in the solution. So, the stronger the acid, the higher the percentage ionization, especially in dilute solutions.\n\nBut wait, the question mentions dissolving one mole of each acid in water, but it doesn't specify the volume of water. However, since it's one mole of each, and assuming the volume is the same for all, perhaps the concentration is the same for comparison purposes.\n\nLet me consider the properties of each acid:\n\nA. HNO2 (Nitrous acid): This is a weak monoprotic acid. It only donates one proton per molecule. Its ionization constant (Ka) is relatively small, meaning it doesn't ionize much in water.\n\nB. HClO4 (Perchloric acid): This is a strong monoprotic acid. It completely ionizes in water, giving up its proton almost entirely. It's one of the strongest known acids.\n\nC. H2S (Hydrogen sulfide): This is a weak diprotic acid. It can donate two protons per molecule, but both protons don't ionize completely, especially the second proton, which is harder to remove.\n\nD. H3PO4 (Phosphoric acid): This is a weak triprotic acid. It can donate three protons per molecule, but again, each subsequent proton is harder to remove, so the ionization decreases with each step.\n\nGiven this information, it seems that HClO4 is the strongest acid among the options, and thus it should have the highest percentage ionization. But let's think deeper to make sure there aren't any nuances I'm missing.\n\nFirst, for HNO2, being a weak acid, its ionization percentage is typically low, maybe around 1-10% depending on the concentration.\n\nHClO4 is a strong acid and should ionize almost completely, so its ionization percentage is close to 100%.\n\nH2S is a weak acid, and even though it can donate two protons, the first proton is easier to remove than the second. So, in a solution, the first ionization is more significant than the second. Therefore, the total ionization percentage wouldn't exceed that of a weak monoprotic acid.\n\nSimilarly, H3PO4 is a weak acid with three ionizable protons, but each subsequent proton is harder to remove, so its ionization percentage is also limited, especially in dilute solutions.\n\nTherefore, among these options, HClO4 should have the highest percentage ionization because it's the strongest acid and ionizes almost completely.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any possibility that the ionization percentages could be affected by the presence of other ions or by the solution's pH.\n\nIn dilute solutions, the ionization of weak acids is favored, but even then, their ionization percentages are relatively low compared to strong acids.\n\nMoreover, in the case of polyprotic acids like H2S and H3PO4, the ionization of multiple protons is stepwise, with each step having its own ionization constant, and each subsequent step having a smaller ionization constant because it's harder to remove additional protons.\n\nTherefore, the total ionization percentage for H2S and H3PO4 wouldn't surpass that of a strong monoprotic acid like HClO4.\n\nWait a minute, but what if the solution is concentrated? Could that change things?\n\nWell, in concentrated solutions, the ionization of weak acids can be suppressed due to the common ion effect, meaning that if there are already a lot of hydrogen ions present, the acid may ionize less.\n\nHowever, since the problem specifies dissolving one mole of each acid in water, presumably to make one liter of solution (though the volume isn't specified), but assuming it's one molar solution for comparison.\n\nIn such a case, HClO4 would still ionize almost completely because it's a strong acid, while the weak acids would ionize to a much lesser extent.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. HClO4.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the ionization percentages more carefully.\n\nFor HNO2, Ka = 4.5 \u00d7 10^-4. In a 1 M solution, the ionization percentage can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\% \\text{ionization} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{K_a \\times C}{100} } \\]\n\nWhere C is the concentration (1 M).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\% \\text{ionization} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{4.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\times 1}{100} } = \\sqrt{4.5 \\times 10^{-6} } = 0.00212 \\] or about 0.212%.\n\nFor HClO4, being a strong acid, it ionizes almost completely, so the percentage ionization is nearly 100%.\n\nFor H2S, Ka1 = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-7 and Ka2 = 1.3 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\nIn a 1 M solution, the first ionization would give:\n\n\\[ \\% \\text{ionization} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{K_{a1} \\times C}{100} } = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\times 1}{100} } = \\sqrt{1.0 \\times 10^{-9} } = 0.000316 \\] or about 0.0316%.\n\nThe second ionization is much smaller due to the much smaller Ka2 value.\n\nFor H3PO4, Ka1 = 7.5 \u00d7 10^-3, Ka2 = 6.2 \u00d7 10^-8, Ka3 = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\nAgain, in a 1 M solution, the first ionization percentage would be:\n\n\\[ \\% \\text{ionization} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{K_{a1} \\times C}{100} } = \\sqrt{ \\frac{7.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 1}{100} } = \\sqrt{7.5 \\times 10^{-5} } = 0.00274 \\] or about 0.274%.\n\nThe second and third ionizations contribute much less.\n\nTherefore, clearly, HClO4 has the highest percentage ionization among these acids.\n\nBut wait, what if the solution isn't one molar? What if the volume of water is different?\n\nThe problem states that one mole of each compound is dissolved in water, but doesn't specify the volume. However, since it's one mole of each, and assuming similar volumes of water for comparison, the concentration shouldn't affect the comparison as long as the volumes are the same.\n\nMoreover, in very dilute solutions, the ionization percentages of weak acids can increase, but even then, they wouldn't reach the ionization percentages of strong acids.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the exact concentration, HClO4 should have the highest percentage ionization.\n\nAnother angle to consider: perhaps the pH of the solution affects the ionization percentage.\n\nBut since HClO4 is a strong acid, it produces a solution with a low pH, which would suppress the ionization of any weak acids present, but in this case, each acid is dissolved separately.\n\nThus, this shouldn't affect the comparison.\n\nAdditionally, considering that H2S and H3PO4 are weak acids with multiple ionizable protons, their ionization steps are dependent on the pH of the solution, and in their own solutions, the first ionization would set the pH, affecting subsequent ionizations.\n\nBut again, this reinforces that their total ionization percentages are lower than that of a strong monoprotic acid like HClO4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. HClO4."
