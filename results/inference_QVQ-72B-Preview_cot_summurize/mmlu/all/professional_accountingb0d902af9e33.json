                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Sussman Co. has prepared cash-basis financial statements for January, but we need to restate them to the accrual basis. I need to figure out by how much the income will increase as a result of this restatement.\n\nFirst, I should understand the difference between cash basis and accrual basis accounting. In cash basis, revenue is recognized only when cash is received, and expenses are recognized when cash is paid. In accrual basis, revenue is recognized when it's earned, regardless of when the cash is received, and expenses are recognized when they're incurred, not necessarily when they're paid.\n\nGiven that, let's look at Sussman's January activities:\n\n1. Credit sales of $5,600.\n\n2. Collections of $1,900 relating to January credit sales.\n\n3. Accrued salaries of $1,200.\n\nOn the cash basis, revenue would be recognized only for the cash collected, which is $1,900. But on the accrual basis, we should recognize the total credit sales, which is $5,600, regardless of how much has been collected so far.\n\nSimilarly, for expenses, on cash basis, expenses are recognized when they're paid. But on accrual basis, expenses are recognized when they're incurred. So, if salaries are accrued for $1,200, that means $1,200 of expenses were incurred in January but not yet paid.\n\nNow, let's think about how income is calculated under each basis.\n\nUnder cash basis:\n\nIncome = Cash received from sales - Cash paid for expenses\n\nBut in this case, we only have cash received from sales, which is $1,900, and accrued salaries, which haven't been paid yet, so under cash basis, no expense is recognized yet.\n\nTherefore, cash basis income for January would be $1,900 (cash received from sales) minus $0 (since no salary expense is recognized until paid).\n\nUnder accrual basis:\n\nIncome = Total revenue earned - Total expenses incurred\n\nTotal revenue earned would be the credit sales of $5,600.\n\nTotal expenses incurred would be the accrued salaries of $1,200.\n\nTherefore, accrual basis income for January would be $5,600 - $1,200 = $4,400.\n\nNow, the question is asking by what amount will Sussman's cash-basis income increase as a result of restating these activities to the accrual basis.\n\nSo, we need to find the difference between the accrual basis income and the cash basis income.\n\nCash basis income: $1,900 - $0 = $1,900\n\nAccrual basis income: $5,600 - $1,200 = $4,400\n\nDifference: $4,400 - $1,900 = $2,500\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that under cash basis, only cash receipts are considered as revenue, and under accrual, total earnings are considered, which includes credit sales.\n\nSo, the increase in income would be the credit sales that haven't been collected yet, minus any accrued expenses.\n\nCredit sales not yet collected: $5,600 - $1,900 = $3,700\n\nAccrued expenses: $1,200\n\nSo, net increase: $3,700 (additional revenue recognized) minus $1,200 (expense recognized that wasn't under cash basis) = $2,500\n\nWait, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nBut let's see the options again:\n\nA. $2,500\n\nB. $3,700\n\nC. $4,400\n\nD. $4,900\n\nSo, $2,500 is option A.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to interpret the question.\n\nIs there any possibility that the accrued salaries might affect the cash basis income differently?\n\nUnder cash basis, since salaries are accrued but not paid, they don't affect income until they're paid. So, in January, no salary expense is recognized under cash basis, only when they're paid in the future.\n\nUnder accrual basis, the expense is recognized in the period it's incurred, which is January, even if not paid yet.\n\nTherefore, the difference in income between cash and accrual bases would be:\n\nAccrual basis income: $5,600 - $1,200 = $4,400\n\nCash basis income: $1,900 - $0 = $1,900\n\nDifference: $4,400 - $1,900 = $2,500\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach using T-accounts or something, but I think this is straightforward enough.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. $2,500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
