                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about Hobbes. The question is: According to Hobbes, whenever and wherever men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, there is ______.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. negotiation\n\nB. war\n\nC. democracy\n\nD. freedom\n\nOkay, so I need to recall what Hobbes said about this. I remember that Hobbes was an English philosopher, and he wrote a book called \"Leviathan.\" In that book, he talks about the state of nature, which is kind of like life without any government or authority to enforce rules.\n\nIn the state of nature, according to Hobbes, people are free to do whatever they want, but this freedom leads to chaos and constant conflict because everyone is competing for resources and power. So, without a common power to keep everyone in check, people would be in a perpetual state of war against each other.\n\nWait, but is it war in the traditional sense? Like armies fighting? Probably not. More like a constant fear of violence and a struggle for survival. So, maybe \"war\" is a bit too strong, but I think Hobbes uses the term \"war\" to describe this condition.\n\nLet me think about the options again:\n\nA. negotiation\n\nB. war\n\nC. democracy\n\nD. freedom\n\nHobbes believed that in the state of nature, there is no negotiation because there's no one to enforce agreements. People might make agreements, but there's no guarantee that others will keep them, leading to a breakdown in cooperation.\n\nDemocracy seems unlikely because democracy requires some form of organized government where people can participate in decision-making. In the state of nature, there's no organized government; it's every person for themselves.\n\nFreedom is an interesting option. On one hand, in the state of nature, people are free from external constraints imposed by law or government. But Hobbes argued that this kind of freedom isn't desirable because it leads to insecurity and constant fear.\n\nSo, if I recall correctly, Hobbes thought that without a common power, life would be \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\" He believed that people would live in constant fear of violence and death, leading them to seek ways to escape this condition.\n\nTo escape the state of nature, Hobbes proposed that people agree to form a social contract, where they give up some of their freedoms in exchange for security provided by a central authority, which he called the Leviathan.\n\nGiven all that, I think the answer is B. war. Because Hobbes saw the state of nature as a state of war, where everyone is against everyone else, and there's no peace or security.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I should look up a specific quote from Hobbes to confirm.\n\nOkay, I found this famous quote from Hobbes in \"Leviathan\": \"In such condition, there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\"\n\nSo, this describes the state of nature as a place without order, without arts, without society, and with constant fear of violent death. He refers to it as a state of war.\n\nAnother quote: \"During the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called war; and such a war, as is of every man, against every man.\"\n\nSo, this directly states that without a common power, men are in a state of war against each other.\n\nTherefore, based on these quotes, the answer should be B. war.\n\nI think negotiation doesn't fit because in the state of nature, according to Hobbes, there's no reliable way to enforce agreements, so negotiation would be ineffective.\n\nDemocracy requires some form of government and organized society, which doesn't exist in the state of nature.\n\nFreedom is present in the state of nature, but Hobbes saw it as a freedom that leads to chaos and misery, not something desirable.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is B. war.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
