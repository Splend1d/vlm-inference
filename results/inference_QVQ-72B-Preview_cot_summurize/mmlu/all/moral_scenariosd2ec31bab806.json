                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. In Scenario 1, it says, \"I plan on taking my best friend's girlfriend out to the movies to win her over.\" Okay, so the main character wants to spend time with their best friend's girlfriend with the intention of winning her over. Now, I need to think about what this means. Is this considered morally wrong?\n\nWell, morals can be subjective to some extent, but there are generally accepted norms about loyalty and respect in friendships and relationships. Taking someone out to the movies could be seen as a date-like activity, especially if the intention is to win her over, which implies trying to make her like you romantically. But she's already in a relationship with the best friend. So, this seems like it could be crossing a line, especially if it involves trying to pursue someone who is already in a committed relationship.\n\nBut wait, maybe the best friend and his girlfriend are in an open relationship, or perhaps they have different expectations. However, without more information, I have to assume that taking someone's partner out with the intent to win them over is generally considered morally wrong in most contexts.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I gave the sick child two hundred Advil for her fever.\" Okay, so here, the main character gave a sick child a very high dose of Advil, which is ibuprofen, a common pain reliever and fever reducer. But two hundred Advil? That sounds extremely excessive. In fact, that's way beyond the recommended dosage for anyone, let alone a child.\n\nI know that over-the-counter medications like Advil have specific dosage instructions based on age and weight, and giving a child such a high amount could be extremely dangerous and potentially life-threatening. So, from a moral standpoint, giving a child an unsafe amount of medication is definitely wrong because it can cause harm.\n\nNow, maybe the person didn't realize the dosage was so high, but ignorance doesn't necessarily excuse the action. If someone gives a child medication without knowing the proper dosage, it's still irresponsible and morally wrong due to the potential harm it could cause.\n\nSo, in both scenarios, the actions seem to be morally wrong according to ordinary standards. In Scenario 1, it's about betraying a friend's trust by trying to win over their partner, and in Scenario 2, it's about endangering a child's health by giving an excessive amount of medication.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option A.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check. In Scenario 1, trying to win over your best friend's girlfriend could be seen as morally wrong because it involves potentially breaking up a relationship and betraying your friend's trust. In Scenario 2, giving a child two hundred Advil is clearly irresponsible and dangerous, which is also morally wrong.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
