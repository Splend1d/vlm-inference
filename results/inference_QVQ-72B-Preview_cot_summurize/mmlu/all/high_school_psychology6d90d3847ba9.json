The options are A. biological, B. behavioral, C. cognitive, and D. humanistic.\"\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to find an approach in psychology that focuses on people's feelings and sees human nature as inherently positive and geared towards growth.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these approaches is about.\n\nStarting with the biological approach. This one seems to focus on the physical aspects of behavior, like genetics, neuroscience, and physiology. It's all about how our bodies and brains influence our thoughts and actions. But does it emphasize people's feelings and view human nature as naturally positive and growth-seeking? Hmm, not really. It's more about the mechanical aspects of being human, not so much about emotions or positive growth. So, maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nNext, the behavioral approach. I remember this one focuses on observable behaviors and how they are shaped by environmental factors, especially through reinforcement and punishment. It's more about external stimuli and responses. While it does consider emotions indirectly, it's not primarily concerned with people's feelings. And it doesn't necessarily view human nature as inherently positive or growth-seeking. In fact, behaviorism often sees behavior as a response to the environment, which can be positive or negative. So, probably not the best fit for the description in the question.\n\nThen there's the cognitive approach. This one deals with mental processes like thinking, memory, perception, and problem-solving. It's about how we process information and make sense of the world. While it does touch on emotions in how they can affect cognition, it's more centered on the thought processes rather than feelings. Again, it doesn't particularly emphasize human nature as naturally positive or growth-seeking. It's more neutral in that regard. So, maybe not the answer here.\n\nLastly, the humanistic approach. Now, this one sounds familiar in terms of focusing on human potential and personal growth. It emphasizes individual experience, free will, and the unique qualities of human beings. It was developed in reaction to both psychoanalysis and behaviorism, which were seen as too deterministic and not sufficiently recognizing the\u4e3b\u52a8\u6027 of the individual.\n\nHumanistic psychology is known for its emphasis on subjective experience and the inherent goodness of human nature. It sees people as naturally growth-seeking and capable of self-actualization, which is reaching one's full potential. This approach places a high value on emotions and personal feelings, considering them essential components of human experience.\n\nSo, comparing this with the other options, the humanistic approach seems to align perfectly with the description in the question. It emphasizes people's feelings and views human nature as naturally positive and growth-seeking.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think about any possible confusion. For example, does the cognitive approach also consider growth and positivity? Well, yes, in a way, as positive thinking and optimism are part of cognitive processes. But the primary focus of cognitive psychology is on mental processes, not specifically on emotions or the inherent positivity of human nature.\n\nSimilarly, in the biological approach, while it does study emotions at a neurological level, it doesn't necessarily view human nature as inherently positive or growth-seeking. It's more about understanding the biological bases of behavior, which can include both positive and negative aspects.\n\nThe behavioral approach, as I thought earlier, is more about observable behaviors and environmental influences, without emphasizing internal feelings or the intrinsic positiveness of human nature.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer to the question is D. humanistic. This approach emphasizes the importance of people's feelings and views human nature as naturally positive and growth-seeking.\n\nTo wrap it up, the humanistic approach in psychology is characterized by its focus on individual experience, emotions, and the inherent potential for growth and self-actualization. It stands out among the other approaches listed for its emphasis on the positive aspects of human nature and the importance of personal feelings in understanding behavior.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. humanistic}} \\]"
