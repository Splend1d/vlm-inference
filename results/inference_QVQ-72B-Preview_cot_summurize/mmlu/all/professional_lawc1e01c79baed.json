                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a dishwasher that's malfunctioning and ends up shocking someone. Let me try to wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst off, there's a woman who had her kitchen renovated. She bought a new dishwasher, and the contractor installed it. Two months later, she's with her friend, and they notice the dishwasher is acting weird\u2014it keeps stopping and starting, and then sparks start flying out from under it. The friend suggests not touching it because it might be electrocutable, which is a pretty smart call.\n\nBut then the woman thinks about going to the fuse box in the basement to cut off the electricity. Her friend decides to check inside the dishwasher first. When he touches the metal handle on the door, he gets a really bad electric shock. It turns out the dishwasher has an internal wiring defect that's causing it to malfunction. The contractor who installed it didn't ground it properly, which should have directed any electric current safely away. The manufacturer had instructions for proper grounding, but the contractor didn't follow them.\n\nNow, the friend wants to sue the manufacturer of the dishwasher for his injuries using strict tort liability. The question is, what's the likely outcome? The options are:\n\nA. Recover, because the dishwasher was defectively made.\n\nB. Recover, because the manufacturer is vicariously liable for the improper installation.\n\nC. Not recover, because the friend assumed the risk by trying to open the dishwasher.\n\nD. Not recover, because the friend was not the purchaser of the dishwasher.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, what is strict tort liability? I remember from law school that strict tort liability is a legal doctrine where someone can be held responsible for damages caused by their product, even if they weren't negligent in making it. So, the manufacturer can be held liable just because the product was defective and caused harm, regardless of whether they were careful or not.\n\nIn this case, the dishwasher had an internal wiring defect that caused it to malfunction and emit sparks, which ultimately led to the friend getting shocked. So, that sounds like a defect in the product.\n\nBut wait, there's more to it. The contractor who installed the dishwasher didn't ground it properly, which is supposed to lead any excess electricity away safely. If the contractor had followed the manufacturer's instructions for grounding, the electric current might not have caused the shock.\n\nSo, was the defect in the dishwasher itself, or was it the improper installation that caused the harm?\n\nI think the key here is that the dishwasher had an internal wiring defect that caused it to malfunction. Even if installed correctly, this defect could potentially cause problems. The improper grounding by the contractor exacerbated the situation, but the primary issue seems to be the defective wiring in the dishwasher.\n\nNow, considering strict tort liability, the manufacturer is being sued for the defect in the product. The friend was injured by this defect, so in theory, he should be able to recover damages from the manufacturer.\n\nBut there are a couple of potential hurdles mentioned.\n\nFirst, the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence and assumption of risk rules. Contributory negligence means that if the plaintiff was negligent in a way that contributed to their injury, they might not be able to recover damages. Assumption of risk means that if the plaintiff knew about the risk and voluntarily exposed themselves to it, they might not be able to recover.\n\nIn this case, the friend knew that the dishwasher was malfunctioning and that there might be a short circuit, so there was a risk of electrocution. Despite that, he decided to open the dishwasher, which resulted in him getting shocked.\n\nSo, could the manufacturer argue that the friend assumed the risk by opening the dishwasher, knowing that it might be dangerous?\n\nThat seems plausible. The friend was warned by his own words not to touch it because it might cause electrocution, but he went ahead and touched it anyway.\n\nOn the other hand, the defect in the dishwasher was the direct cause of the injury, and the friend might not have known the full extent of the danger.\n\nI need to think about whether the friend's action in opening the dishwasher was a reasonable one under the circumstances or if it was a reckless decision that contributed to his injury.\n\nAlso, the fact that he wasn't the purchaser might come into play, but I think in strict tort liability claims, you don't have to be the buyer to sue for injuries caused by a defective product. So, option D might not be correct.\n\nOption B suggests that the manufacturer is vicariously liable for the improper installation by the contractor. Vicarious liability typically applies to employer-employee relationships, where the employer is responsible for the actions of their employees. In this case, the contractor was installing the dishwasher, but was the contractor an employee of the manufacturer? Probably not. The contractor seems to be a separate entity, perhaps hired by the homeowner.\n\nSo, it's unlikely that the manufacturer is vicariously liable for the contractor's actions. That makes option B less plausible.\n\nNow, between options A and C, I have to decide whether the friend will recover because the dishwasher was defectively made, or whether he won't recover because he assumed the risk by opening the dishwasher.\n\nLet me consider the defect first. The dishwasher had an internal wiring defect that caused it to malfunction and emit sparks. This is a clear defect in the product, which under strict tort liability should make the manufacturer liable for any injuries caused by that defect.\n\nHowever, the friend knew there was a problem with the dishwasher and that it might be dangerous, but he still chose to open it, resulting in him getting shocked.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, assuming the risk can be a defense against strict tort liability claims. If the plaintiff knew of the danger and voluntarily exposed themselves to it, they might not be able to recover damages.\n\nBut, on the other hand, the defect in the product was the primary cause of the injury, and the friend might not have fully appreciated the severity of the danger.\n\nI need to think about whether the friend's action was so unreasonable that it bars his recovery, or if the manufacturer's defect was the main cause of the injury.\n\nPerhaps both the defect and the friend's action contributed to the injury, but in strict tort liability, the focus is on the defect in the product and whether it caused the injury.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the defect was the main cause, I think the friend would likely recover, despite his action in opening the dishwasher.\n\nMoreover, in some jurisdictions, assumption of risk might reduce the damages but not completely bar recovery, especially in strict liability cases.\n\nTherefore, I'm leaning towards option A: the friend will recover because the dishwasher was defectively made.\n\nBut I should double-check.\n\nLet me see if there's any case law or specific principles that apply here.\n\nI recall that in strict product liability cases, the plaintiff has to show that the product was defective, that the defect caused the injury, and that the product was being used as intended.\n\nIn this case, the dishwasher was being used as intended when it malfunctioned and caused the injury due to its defective wiring.\n\nThe fact that the friend opened the dishwasher knowing there was a risk might be seen as a failure to mitigate damages or as contributory negligence, but in strict liability cases, the emphasis is on the defect and the injury caused by it.\n\nSo, even if the friend assumed some risk, the manufacturer is still liable for the defect.\n\nTherefore, I think the friend will recover.\n\nWait a minute, but the question mentions that the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence and assumption of risk rules. Does that mean that if the plaintiff was negligent or assumed the risk, they can't recover?\n\nI think in some jurisdictions, strict liability claims can still be barred by assumption of risk or contributory negligence, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nMaybe I need to look this up, but since this is a hypothetical scenario, I'll have to rely on my understanding.\n\nGiven that, I still think that the defect in the dishwasher is the primary cause of the injury, and while the friend's action in opening it might be seen as assuming some risk, it's not enough to completely bar his recovery.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is A: recover, because the dishwasher was defectively made.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
