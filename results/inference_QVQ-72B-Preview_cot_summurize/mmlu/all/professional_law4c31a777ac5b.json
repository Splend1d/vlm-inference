                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about an employee who negotiated a lucrative contract for her employer and, as a result, the employer orally promised her a $10,000 bonus at the end of the year for her \"good work.\" But then, at the end of the year, the employer says that because the company's profits weren't as high as expected, the bonus won't be paid. Now, I need to figure out which of the given options correctly describes the legal effect of the employer's promise to pay the bonus.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall some basic contract law principles. A contract is generally enforceable if there's an offer, acceptance, and consideration. In this case, the employer orally promised a bonus, which seems like an offer, and presumably, the employee accepted it by continuing to work or something along those lines. But the tricky part is the consideration.\n\nOption C says it's unenforceable because it wasn't supported by legally sufficient consideration. So, consideration is something of value exchanged between the parties. It can be money, a promise, or some action. In employment contexts, it's often additional duties or changes in job responsibilities that can serve as consideration for a bonus promise.\n\nIn this scenario, the employee already negotiated the contract before the bonus was promised. So, did she provide any additional consideration after the promise was made? It seems like the negotiation was completed before the promise, so maybe there isn't new consideration. But perhaps her continued employment or some other action could be considered consideration.\n\nOption A says it's enforceable because the employee conferred a material benefit on the employer by negotiating the lucrative contract. That sounds plausible, but I need to think about whether the benefit was already compensated for by her salary or other forms of payment.\n\nOption B says it's enforceable because the employer was morally obligated to pay the bonus. Hmm, morality isn't really a basis for enforcing a contract in law. Just because someone feels they should do something doesn't make it legally binding.\n\nOption D says it's unenforceable because it wasn't in writing. Well, generally, oral contracts are enforceable unless they fall under the statute of frauds, which requires certain contracts to be in writing. A bonus promise might or might not fall under that, depending on the jurisdiction and the terms.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. If the employee had already performed the act that led to the bonus before the promise was made, then the promise might lack consideration because the act was already done. In other words, the employee didn't do anything extra in reliance on the promise.\n\nBut the scenario says the employee successfully negotiated the contract, and then the employer promised the bonus because of her \"good work.\" So, it seems like the bonus was in recognition of her past performance, not in exchange for future performance.\n\nIn contract law, a promise to give something in return for something already done might not be enforceable because there's no new consideration. However, there are exceptions, especially if the promise is made in recognition of extraordinary efforts or results.\n\nAlso, some employers have policies or implied contracts regarding bonuses, especially if they're customary or part of the employee's compensation package.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the employee relied on the promise to her detriment, but I don't have information about that in the scenario.\n\nLet me consider the best answer among the options provided.\n\nOption A suggests it's enforceable because the employee conferred a material benefit. That could be a valid point if the benefit wasn't already compensated for by her regular salary or other forms of payment.\n\nOption C says it's unenforceable due to lack of consideration. This seems plausible if the employee had already performed the act that led to the bonus before the promise was made, and there was no new consideration.\n\nOption D suggests it's unenforceable because it wasn't in writing. But oral contracts are generally enforceable, so unless there's a specific requirement for a written agreement, this seems unlikely.\n\nGiven these considerations, I'm leaning towards Option C: it's unenforceable because it wasn't supported by legally sufficient consideration.\n\nBut let me double-check. Suppose the employee negotiated the contract, and then the employer promised a bonus for that specific achievement. If the employee didn't do anything extra after the promise, then perhaps there's no new consideration to support the promise.\n\nHowever, maybe the employee's continued employment or expectation of future employment could be considered consideration. But that seems a bit of a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a promissory estoppel argument here, where the employee relied on the promise to her detriment, but again, the scenario doesn't specify any reliance.\n\nI think the key here is that the promise was made after the act that led to the bonus, and there was no new consideration provided by the employee in exchange for the bonus promise.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option C: it is unenforceable because it was not supported by legally sufficient consideration.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
