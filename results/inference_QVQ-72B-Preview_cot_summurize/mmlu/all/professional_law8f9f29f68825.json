                    "text": "So I've got this contract law problem here, and I need to figure out who's most likely to prevail if the nursing home sues the owner for breach of contract. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a written contract between the owner of a pizza restaurant and an employee. The employee is hired as the manager for three years, and the salary is $2,000 per month. Here's the interesting part: the contract says that half of the salary goes to the employee and half to the employee's elderly mother. Additionally, there's a clause that says, \"the monies due hereunder shall not be assignable.\"\n\nThen, the mother writes a letter to the owner, saying, \"Kindly pay the amounts due me under your contract with my son directly to the nursing home, where I am presently a patient.\"\n\nFor the first year, the owner pays $1,000 to the employee and $1,000 to the nursing home. After one year, competition increases because another pizza restaurant opens across the street, and business starts declining. As a result, the owner asks the employee to take a $500 salary cut or risk being fired. The employee reluctantly agrees to this oral modification of the contract, and they agree that the owner will pay $1,000 to the employee and $500 to the nursing home.\n\nNow, the nursing home is bringing a suit against the owner for breach of contract, presumably because the owner reduced the payment to the nursing home from $1,000 to $500 per month.\n\nI need to determine who is most likely to prevail in this lawsuit: the owner or the nursing home.\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\nA. The owner, because the mother's assignment to the nursing home was void as violative of the anti-assignment clause.\n\nB. The owner, because the agreement between the owner and the employee reduced the owner's obligations to the nursing home.\n\nC. The nursing home, because the mother's assignment would be enforceable despite the agreement between the owner and the employee.\n\nD. The nursing home, because the mother's gratuitous assignment was irrevocable.\n\nOkay, let's analyze each option.\n\nStarting with option A: the owner argues that the mother's assignment to the nursing home is void because it violates the anti-assignment clause in the contract.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the anti-assignment clause means. It says, \"the monies due hereunder shall not be assignable.\" This likely means that the employee cannot transfer or assign their right to receive the money to someone else.\n\nNow, the mother is supposed to receive half of the salary, which is $1,000 per month. The mother then assigns her right to receive this money to the nursing home.\n\nThe question is whether this assignment is valid, given the anti-assignment clause.\n\nGenerally, anti-assignment clauses prevent the transfer of rights under a contract without the consent of the other party. However, there are exceptions, such as assignments for the benefit of creditors or assignments of rights that are not specifically prohibited.\n\nIn this case, the mother is assigning her right to receive money from the owner to the nursing home. The anti-assignment clause is in the contract between the owner and the employee, not directly involving the mother.\n\nWait a minute, the contract is between the owner and the employee, and it specifies that half the salary goes to the mother. So, the mother is a third-party beneficiary of the contract, receiving a portion of the salary directly.\n\nThe anti-assignment clause is part of the contract between the owner and the employee, and it likely applies to the rights under the contract. The mother, as a third-party beneficiary, may or may not be bound by this clause.\n\nI need to check if the anti-assignment clause explicitly includes third-party beneficiaries or if it only applies to the original parties.\n\nIf the anti-assignment clause only applies to the parties to the contract (the owner and the employee), then the mother, as a third-party beneficiary, may not be bound by it.\n\nHowever, if the clause is broad enough to include assignments by third-party beneficiaries, then the mother's assignment to the nursing home could be invalid.\n\nI need to look at the specific language of the anti-assignment clause. It says, \"the monies due hereunder shall not be assignable.\" The phrase \"due hereunder\" likely refers to the monies payable under the contract, which includes the payments to the mother.\n\nBut the mother is not a party to the contract; she's a third-party beneficiary. Generally, third-party beneficiaries can enforce the contract, but assignments of their rights might be restricted by the contract terms.\n\nThere might be a question of whether the anti-assignment clause applies to the mother's rights as a third-party beneficiary.\n\nSome courts may hold that the anti-assignment clause applies to prevent the mother from assigning her rights to the nursing home, while others might argue that since she's not a party to the contract, the clause doesn't bind her.\n\nThis seems a bit unclear, so maybe option A isn't the strongest argument for the owner.\n\nMoving on to option B: the owner argues that the agreement between the owner and the employee reduces the owner's obligations to the nursing home.\n\nHere, the employee and the owner orally agreed to reduce the salary from $2,000 to $1,500 per month. As part of this agreement, the owner promised to pay $1,000 to the employee and $500 to the nursing home.\n\nThe original contract required the owner to pay $1,000 to the employee and $1,000 to the mother (now assigned to the nursing home).\n\nSo, the oral modification reduces the total payment from $2,000 to $1,500, with $1,000 to the employee and $500 to the nursing home.\n\nThe question is whether this oral modification affects the nursing home's right to receive $1,000 per month.\n\nGenerally, modifications to a written contract require mutual consent and, in some cases, additional consideration, especially if the original contract requires modifications to be in writing.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, the modification is oral, and it's between the owner and the employee.\n\nDoes this oral modification affect the nursing home's rights?\n\nWell, the nursing home's rights are derived from the mother's assignment of her right to receive $1,000 per month from the owner.\n\nIf the owner and the employee modify their contract to reduce the salary, does that affect the mother's assigned rights?\n\nProbably, because the salary reduction affects the total amount payable under the contract.\n\nBut the nursing home wasn't a party to the modification and didn't consent to it.\n\nIn contract law, third-party beneficiaries can be affected by modifications to the contract only if the modification is properly consented to by all necessary parties, including the third-party beneficiary.\n\nIf the nursing home didn't consent to the salary reduction, then the owner might still be obligated to pay the full $1,000 to the nursing home, despite the oral modification with the employee.\n\nThis suggests that option B might not be correct, because the agreement between the owner and the employee might not be sufficient to reduce the owner's obligations to the nursing home.\n\nOption C: the nursing home prevails because the mother's assignment would be enforceable despite the agreement between the owner and the employee.\n\nThis seems plausible. If the mother validly assigned her right to receive $1,000 per month to the nursing home, then the nursing home has a direct right to receive that money from the owner.\n\nThe oral modification between the owner and the employee might not affect this right, especially since the nursing home didn't consent to the modification.\n\nMoreover, the anti-assignment clause might not apply to the mother's assignment, as she is a third-party beneficiary.\n\nTherefore, the nursing home could argue that they are still entitled to receive $1,000 per month from the owner, regardless of any modifications between the owner and the employee.\n\nThis seems like a strong argument for the nursing home.\n\nOption D: the nursing home prevails because the mother's gratuitous assignment was irrevocable.\n\nA gratuitous assignment is typically revocable unless there's some consideration or other factors that make it irrevocable.\n\nIn this case, the mother assigned her right to receive money from the owner to the nursing home, presumably to pay for her care.\n\nIf the assignment was gratuitous (i.e., without consideration), it might generally be revocable by the assignor (the mother).\n\nHowever, once the assignee (the nursing home) relies on the assignment to their detriment, the assignment might become irrevocable.\n\nFor example, if the nursing home provided services to the mother in reliance on receiving the $1,000 per month from the owner, they might have a claim that the assignment is irrevocable.\n\nBut, in this problem, there's no information about whether the nursing home provided any services or relied on the assignment in any specific way.\n\nTherefore, it's unclear whether the assignment is irrevocable.\n\nOption D might be too speculative without more information about the nursing home's reliance.\n\nComparing options C and D, option C seems stronger because it relies on the enforceability of the assignment despite the oral modification between the owner and the employee.\n\nOption D relies on the assignment being irrevocable, which isn't clearly established in the facts provided.\n\nTherefore, I think the nursing home is most likely to prevail because the mother's assignment would be enforceable despite the agreement between the owner and the employee.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
