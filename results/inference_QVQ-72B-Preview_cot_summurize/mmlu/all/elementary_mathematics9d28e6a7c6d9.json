                    "text": "Let's see here. Mrs. Kinney bought batteries in packs of 4 for her students' science experiments. And the question is asking which of these numbers could be the total number of batteries she bought: 22, 26, 28, or 30.\n\nOkay, so if she's buying packs of 4 batteries each, that means the total number of batteries should be a multiple of 4, right? Because, for example, if she buys 1 pack, she has 4 batteries; if she buys 2 packs, she has 8 batteries; 3 packs would be 12, and so on.\n\nSo, I need to check which of these numbers\u201422, 26, 28, or 30\u2014is divisible by 4 without any remainder.\n\nLet me check 22 first. If I divide 22 by 4, 4 times 5 is 20, which is less than 22, and 4 times 6 is 24, which is more than 22. So, 22 divided by 4 is 5 with a remainder of 2. That means it's not a multiple of 4.\n\nNext, 26. Dividing 26 by 4: 4 times 6 is 24, and 4 times 7 is 28. 26 is between 24 and 28, so it also has a remainder. 4 times 6 is 24, which is less than 26, and the difference is 2. So, remainder of 2 again. Not a multiple of 4.\n\nNow, 28. 4 times 7 is 28. That's perfect. No remainder. So, 28 is a multiple of 4.\n\nLastly, 30. 4 times 7 is 28, and 4 times 8 is 32. 30 is between 28 and 32, so dividing 30 by 4 gives 7 with a remainder of 2. So, it's not a multiple of 4.\n\nTherefore, out of these options, 28 is the only number that is a multiple of 4. Hence, it's the only possible total number of batteries Mrs. Kinney could have bought.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it. I know that numbers that are multiples of 4 have their last two digits divisible by 4. So, for 22, 22 divided by 4 is 5.5, which isn't an integer. For 26, 26 divided by 4 is 6.5, not an integer. 28 divided by 4 is 7, which is an integer. And 30 divided by 4 is 7.5, not an integer.\n\nSo, yeah, 28 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if she bought packs of 4, but perhaps there are some batteries left over or something. But no, the problem says she bought packs of 4, so assuming she bought whole packs, the total number should indeed be a multiple of 4.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The answer is 28.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28} \\]"
