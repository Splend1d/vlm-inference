                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. It seems a bit complicated at first, but if I break it down, I can figure it out.\n\nFirst, Lemon bought 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock in year 1 at $10.50 per share. So, the initial basis in those shares is the purchase price multiplied by the number of shares. That should be 2000 shares times $10.50.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n2000 shares * $10.50 = $21,000\n\nSo, the initial basis is $21,000.\n\nNext, in year 4, Lemon received a 5% non-taxable dividend of Spectrol common stock. Since it's a stock dividend and it's non-taxable, I don't have to adjust the basis for taxes, but I need to figure out how this dividend affects the number of shares and the basis per share.\n\nA 5% stock dividend means that for every 100 shares owned, the shareholder receives an additional 5 shares. So, for Lemon's 2000 shares, the number of additional shares received would be 5% of 2000.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n5% of 2000 shares = 0.05 * 2000 = 100 shares\n\nSo, Lemon receives an additional 100 shares as a dividend.\n\nNow, the total number of shares Lemon has after the dividend is:\n\n2000 shares + 100 shares = 2100 shares\n\nBut what happens to the basis? Since the dividend is non-taxable, I don't think the basis increases, but I need to adjust the basis per share.\n\nI think the total basis remains $21,000, but now it's spread over 2100 shares. So, the basis per share after the dividend would be $21,000 divided by 2100 shares.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n$21,000 / 2100 shares = $10.00 per share\n\nSo, after the stock dividend, each share has a basis of $10.00.\n\nMoving on to year 5, there's a 2-for-1 stock split. A stock split doesn't affect the total basis, just the number of shares and the per-share basis.\n\nIn a 2-for-1 split, each share is split into two shares, so the number of shares doubles, but the basis per share is halved.\n\nSo, before the split: 2100 shares at $10.00 per share.\n\nAfter the split: 2100 * 2 = 4200 shares at $10.00 / 2 = $5.00 per share.\n\nWait, but I think in a stock split, the basis is adjusted accordingly. Let me confirm that.\n\nActually, in a stock split, the basis of the original shares is allocated to the new shares. For a 2-for-1 split, the total basis remains the same, but it's divided among the new shares.\n\nSo, total basis is still $21,000, and now there are 4200 shares, so the basis per share is $21,000 / 4200 shares = $5.00 per share.\n\nNow, in the current year, Lemon sells 800 shares. We need to find the basis in those 800 shares.\n\nSince the basis is $5.00 per share, the basis for 800 shares would be 800 * $5.00.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n800 shares * $5.00 = $4,000\n\nSo, the basis in the 800 shares sold is $4,000.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $4,000\n\nB. $8,000\n\nC. $8,400\n\nD. $16,800\n\nOption A seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nStarting with 2000 shares at $10.50, basis $21,000.\n\nAfter 5% stock dividend: 2000 + (5% of 2000) = 2100 shares, basis remains $21,000, so $10.00 per share.\n\nThen, 2-for-1 stock split: 2100 * 2 = 4200 shares, basis per share $21,000 / 4200 = $5.00 per share.\n\nSelling 800 shares: 800 * $5.00 = $4,000.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors, and the logic seems sound.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $4,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 4000} \\]"
