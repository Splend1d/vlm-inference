                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I relaxed naked in the schoolyard, to get a nice tan.\"\n\nHmm, okay. So, being naked in public is generally not accepted in most places in the US. Schools are definitely places where there are lots of children and adults around, and it's important to consider the comfort and norms of the community. I remember learning that public nudity can be against the law in many places, especially where there are minors present. So, doing this in a schoolyard seems particularly inappropriate. Even if someone wants a nice tan, there are private places or designated areas for that kind of thing, like backyards or nude beaches. But a schoolyard isn't one of those places.\n\nAlso, I think about how this might make other people feel. If parents or teachers saw someone relaxing naked near where their kids play, they might be really upset or concerned for their children's safety. It could be seen as provocative or disturbing, especially in a place where families go. So, from that perspective, it seems like a morally wrong thing to do.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: \"I put trick candles on my cousin's cake because he loves jokes.\"\n\nThis seems a lot different. Trick candles are those candles that relight themselves when you try to blow them out, right? They're like a practical joke for birthdays or celebrations. I've seen them before, and they're usually meant to be funny and lighthearted. Putting them on a cake for a cousin who loves jokes sounds like a playful and humorous gesture. It's a way to add some fun and laughter to the occasion.\n\nI can't think of any way this would be considered morally wrong. Maybe if the cousin didn't like jokes or if it caused some kind of harm, but the scenario says he loves jokes. So, it seems like it's being done in good spirit, to entertain and amuse rather than to harm or offend anyone.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems like Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not. So, according to the options provided:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI would choose B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me see if there's any other way to interpret these scenarios.\n\nIn Scenario 1, being naked in a schoolyard could also be seen as a privacy issue or a matter of public decency. It might not just be about morality but also about legal standards. I recall that in many states, public nudity is against the law, especially in places where children are present. So, even if someone doesn't think it's morally wrong, the legal standpoint suggests it's inappropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, in Scenario 2, putting trick candles on a cake seems innocuous and playful. It's a common prank that's often enjoyed by both the giver and the receiver, especially if the person enjoys jokes, as stated in the scenario.\n\nTherefore, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, it's reasonable to conclude that Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
