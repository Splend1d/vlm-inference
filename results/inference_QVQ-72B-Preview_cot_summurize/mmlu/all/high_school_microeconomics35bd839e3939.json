                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about a perfectly competitive firm in the short run. There are four options, and I need to pick the one that's true. Let me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that the firm earns a normal profit. Hmm, in perfect competition, in the long run, firms tend to earn normal profits because if there are economic profits, new firms enter the market, increasing supply and driving down prices until only normal profits are made. But this is about the short run. In the short run, can firms earn more or less than normal profits? I think so, because in the short run, the number of firms is fixed, and market adjustments aren't fully completed yet. So, maybe firms can earn positive or negative profits in the short run. So, option A might not be necessarily true.\n\nOption B says that the firm shuts down if the price falls below average total cost. Wait, in perfect competition, the shutdown point is when price falls below average variable cost, not average total cost. Because if price is above average variable cost but below average total cost, the firm can still cover its variable costs and some fixed costs, so it might continue operating in the short run. But if price falls below average variable cost, it's not worthwhile to produce because the firm would be better off shutting down and only paying fixed costs. So, the correct shutdown condition is price < average variable cost, not average total cost. So, option B seems incorrect.\n\nOption C says that the firm earns positive economic profit. As I thought earlier, in the short run, firms in perfect competition can earn positive or negative economic profits. So, it's possible, but it's not necessarily always true. If the market price is above average total cost, then yes, the firm earns positive economic profit. But if price is below average total cost, it earns negative economic profit. So, this option is too specific.\n\nOption D says that the firm may earn positive, negative, or normal profits. This seems to align with what I was thinking. In the short run, depending on the market price and the firm's costs, the firm could be making positive profits, negative profits (i.e., losses), or normal profits. So, this seems plausible.\n\nLet me double-check. In perfect competition, in the short run, firms can experience different levels of profits because the number of firms is fixed, and market forces haven't fully adjusted yet. So, it's possible for firms to have economic profits, losses, or normal profits. Therefore, option D seems to be the correct choice.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider what happens in the short run. If the market price is higher than the average total cost, the firm makes positive economic profit. If it's below average total cost but above average variable cost, the firm makes negative economic profit but continues to operate. If it's exactly at average total cost, the firm makes normal profit. So, all three scenarios are possible in the short run, which makes option D the true statement.\n\nI think I've got it right. Option D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
