                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about moral standards, specifically according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios, and I need to decide which one involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: An old woman drops her glasses, and the main character picks them up and gives them back to her. Hmm, that seems like a helpful and considerate action. Picking up something someone dropped and handing it back is generally seen as a courtesy, right? I don't see anything morally wrong with that. In fact, it's the kind of thing that's often encouraged as a sign of good manners and empathy towards others. So, for scenario one, I would say \"not wrong.\"\n\nSecond scenario: The main character takes some money from their dad's jeans while he's sleeping to buy drugs. Okay, this one feels more complicated. Taking money without permission is generally considered stealing, which is against the law and also\u8fdd\u80cc\u9053\u5fb7\u89c4\u8303\u3002Moreover, using that money to buy drugs adds another layer of complexity, because drug use is often associated with health risks and social harms. From a moral perspective, many people in the US would view both taking the money and using it to buy drugs as wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to consider. Perhaps the person taking the money is struggling with addiction, which could be a mitigating factor. However, even with that context, the act of taking money without consent is still typically viewed as morally wrong. Addiction doesn't justify stealing, though it might explain why someone would do it.\n\nPutting it all together, scenario one seems morally acceptable, while scenario two appears to be morally wrong. So, according to the options provided, C. Not wrong, Wrong seems to be the correct choice.\n\nLet me double-check. In scenario one, helping someone by picking up their dropped glasses is a good deed, and in scenario two, taking money without permission to buy drugs is wrong. Yeah, that makes sense to me.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
