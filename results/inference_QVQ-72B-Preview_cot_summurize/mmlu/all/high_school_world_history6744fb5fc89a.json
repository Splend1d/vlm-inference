                    "text": "So I've got this question here about an excerpt from the Shu Jing, which is an ancient Chinese text from the 6th century BCE. It's talking about Yi Yin sacrificing to the former king and presenting the heir-king before the shrine of his grandfather. Then, Yi Yin is describing the virtue of the Meritorious Ancestor to instruct the young king. There's a lot of talk about the former kings of Xia and their virtues, and how their descendant didn't follow their example, leading to calamities from Heaven.\n\nThe question is asking which phrase can be seen as a statement of the roots of Daoist beliefs. Now, Daoism is a philosophical and religious tradition that emphasizes living in harmony with the Dao, which is sometimes translated as \"the Way.\" It values naturalness, simplicity, and spontaneity, and it often stresses the importance of living in accordance with the natural order of things.\n\nSo, I need to look at the options provided and see which one aligns most closely with these Daoist principles.\n\nOption A says, \"Our king of Shang brilliantly displayed his sagely prowess.\" This seems to be praising the king of Shang for his wise and powerful actions. While wisdom is valued in Daoism, this phrase doesn't directly touch on the core ideas of living in harmony with the Dao or following the natural order.\n\nOption B is, \"The former king began with careful attention to the bonds that hold men together.\" This sounds like it's about social relationships and perhaps governance. Daoism does have something to say about governance, but it's more about leading by example and allowing things to take their natural course rather than imposing strict rules. This phrase might be related, but it doesn't directly evoke the central tenets of Daoism.\n\nOption C reads, \"The birds and beasts . . . enjoyed their existence according to their nature.\" This one interests me. It suggests that animals live in accordance with their natural inclinations, which is a key concept in Daoism. Daoism emphasizes living in harmony with one's true nature and the natural world. So, this seems quite aligned with Daoist thought.\n\nOption D states, \"The ways of Heaven are not invariable: on the good-doer it sends down all blessings, and on the evil-doer it sends down all miseries.\" This seems to be talking about a moral order where good is rewarded and evil is punished. While there is some concept of cause and effect in Daoism, known as yin and yang or cause and effect, Daoism is more about flowing with the natural order rather than adhering to a set of moral commandments.\n\nComparing these options, Option C seems to be the closest to the roots of Daoist beliefs. It directly refers to living according to one's nature, which is a fundamental aspect of Daoist philosophy.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think a bit more. The phrase \"enjoyed their existence according to their nature\" implies that birds and beasts live in a way that is natural and unforced, which is very much in line with Daoist ideas of ziran, or spontaneous naturalness.\n\nOption A is more about prowess and achievement, which isn't directly connected to Daoist roots, although wisdom is valued.\n\nOption B is about social bonds and governance, which might be more Confucian in nature, focusing on social harmony and proper relationships.\n\nOption D suggests a moralistic view of Heaven's rewards and punishments, which again doesn't align perfectly with Daoist thought, which is less concerned with moral judgment and more with aligning with the natural order.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is Option C: \"The birds and beasts . . . enjoyed their existence according to their nature.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
