                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand Kant's Humanity formulation of the categorical imperative. It's a bit tricky, but I think I've got the basics. Kant believes that we should treat humanity, whether in our own person or in that of another, always as an end and never as a means only. So, basically, we shouldn't use people just for our own purposes without considering their own goals and well-being.\n\nFrom this, it seems like we have obligations to consider the ends or goals of others, as long as they're morally permissible. So, one of the general goals we should adopt is to promote the morally permissible ends of others. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the question is asking about two very general goals we are obligated to adopt according to Kant's Humanity formulation. The first is promoting the morally permissible ends of others. The second is... what?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. self-perfection.\n\nB. producing happiness.\n\nC. increasing welfare.\n\nD. self-sacrifice.\n\nHmm, let's think about this.\n\nKant does emphasize the idea of developing our own talents and perfecting ourselves, which might point towards self-perfection. But I'm not sure if that's exactly what he means here.\n\nProducing happiness sounds a bit too utilitarian for Kant, who is more focused on duty and moral law rather than the consequences of actions.\n\nIncreasing welfare is similar to producing happiness, maybe a bit broader, but still, Kant isn't primarily concerned with outcomes.\n\nSelf-sacrifice also doesn't seem quite right, because Kant wouldn't necessarily advocate for always sacrificing oneself; rather, he would suggest acting out of duty, even if it's difficult.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to look at it differently. Perhaps the second goal is to treat ourselves as ends in ourselves as well. So, not just promoting others' ends, but also our own, in a morally permissible way.\n\nBut that doesn't directly correspond to any of the options. Maybe I need to think in terms of respecting our own humanity too.\n\nLet me consider the Humanity formulation again: treat humanity, whether in your own person or that of another, always as an end and never as a means only.\n\nSo, it's about treating both oneself and others as ends, not just means to an end.\n\nGiven that, one of the goals is to promote the morally permissible ends of others. Similarly, perhaps we have a duty to promote our own morally permissible ends.\n\nBut again, none of the options directly say that.\n\nOption A is self-perfection. Kant does talk about the duty to cultivate our own talents and improve ourselves, which could be seen as a form of self-perfection. This aligns somewhat with the idea of treating oneself as an end, by developing one's potential.\n\nOption B is producing happiness. Kant might argue that happiness is not something we have a duty to produce, but rather something that might follow from living a morally good life. He distinguishes between duty and happiness.\n\nOption C is increasing welfare. Welfare is a bit vague, but it could encompass well-being and happiness, which again seems more aligned with consequentialist theories than Kant's deontological ethics.\n\nOption D is self-sacrifice. While Kant might admire selfless actions done out of duty, he doesn't necessarily prescribe that we always sacrifice ourselves. In fact, he might argue that neglecting one's own well-being could be a failure to treat oneself as an end.\n\nGiven all that, I'm leaning towards A. self-perfection. Kant does emphasize the importance of self-improvement and cultivating one's talents as part of respecting humanity in oneself. So, alongside promoting the ends of others, we have a duty to perfect ourselves morally and intellectually.\n\nLet me check that against the other options. If self-perfection involves developing our capacities and talents, which can include moral and intellectual growth, it aligns well with treating ourselves as ends in ourselves, which is part of the Humanity formulation.\n\nOn the other hand, producing happiness or increasing welfare seems more about outcomes and consequences, which isn't the primary focus of Kant's ethics.\n\nSelf-sacrifice might be seen as going against the idea of treating oneself as an end, if taken to an extreme.\n\nTherefore, I think A. self-perfection is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
