                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem about two infinite parallel metal plates with equal surface charge density of the same polarity. I need to figure out what the electric field is in the gap between them. The options are:\n\nA. Same as that produced by one plate.\n\nB. Double the field produced by one plate.\n\nC. Dependent on coordinates of field points.\n\nD. Zero.\n\nHmm, okay. First, I need to recall some basics about electric fields and charged plates. I know that for a single infinite charged plane, the electric field is uniform and points perpendicular to the plane, and its magnitude is given by \u03c3/(2\u03b5\u2080), where \u03c3 is the surface charge density and \u03b5\u2080 is the permittivity of free space.\n\nNow, since there are two plates, both with the same polarity, meaning both have positive charge or both have negative charge, and they're parallel and infinite, I need to consider the superposition of their individual electric fields.\n\nLet me think about the direction of the fields from each plate. If both plates have positive charge, the field from the first plate will point away from it, and the field from the second plate will also point away from it. So, in the space between the two plates, both fields would be pointing in the same direction, meaning they would add up.\n\nSimilarly, if both plates have negative charge, the fields would point towards each plate, and again, in the space between them, both fields would point in the same direction.\n\nSo, in both cases, the fields from each plate add up in the region between them.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to be careful. Is it just as simple as adding the magnitudes of the electric fields from each plate?\n\nLet me consider the electric field due to one plate first. As I recalled, it's \u03c3/(2\u03b5\u2080), pointing away from the plate for positive charge, or towards it for negative charge.\n\nSo, for two plates, both with positive charge, the field from plate 1 points away from plate 1, and the field from plate 2 points away from plate 2. In the region between them, both fields point in the same direction, so their magnitudes should add up.\n\nSimilarly, for negative charges, both fields point towards the plates, again in the same direction in the region between them.\n\nTherefore, the total electric field in the gap should be \u03c3/(2\u03b5\u2080) + \u03c3/(2\u03b5\u2080) = \u03c3/\u03b5\u2080.\n\nSo, that would be double the field produced by one plate.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option B says double the field produced by one plate. So, that seems to fit.\n\nHowever, I should double-check this reasoning. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nLet me think about the electric field lines. For a single infinite charged plane, field lines are perpendicular to the plane and point away if positive, towards if negative.\n\nWith two parallel plates, both positively charged, the field lines from each plate point away from their surfaces. In the region between them, the field lines from both plates point in the same direction, so they should reinforce each other.\n\nOutside both plates, the field lines from each plate would point away from their surfaces, but since they are parallel, the net field would be the vector sum of both.\n\nWait, but since they are infinite and parallel, the field should be uniform between them and outside, but with different magnitudes.\n\nActually, no. For infinite parallel plates with the same polarity, the field between them should be \u03c3/\u03b5\u2080, as I calculated earlier.\n\nBut let's consider if the plates have the same charge, are they going to repel each other, and how does that affect the field?\n\nWell, yes, they repel each other, and the electric field between them is the sum of their individual fields, which points from one plate to the other.\n\nWait, but in reality, for conductors, the charges reside on the outer surfaces, so between the plates, there would be only one surface charge producing the field.\n\nWait a second, maybe I need to think about the surface charges on the plates.\n\nLet me consider that each plate has two surfaces: the inner surface facing the other plate and the outer surface facing outward.\n\nSince the plates are charged with equal surface charge density of the same polarity, and assuming they are isolated, the charges would distribute themselves on the outer surfaces.\n\nBut actually, for conductors, in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor is zero, so any net charge resides on the surface.\n\nBut in this case, since both plates are charged positively, say, there is a positive charge on the outer surface of each plate.\n\nWait, no. If both plates are positively charged, does that mean they have positive charges on their outer surfaces, and what about the inner surfaces?\n\nI think I need to consider the charge distribution more carefully.\n\nLet me assume that both plates have a uniform positive surface charge density \u03c3.\n\nNow, each plate is a conductor, so in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside each plate must be zero.\n\nLet me consider the electric field due to one plate first.\n\nFor a single infinite charged plane with surface charge density \u03c3, the electric field is \u03c3/(2\u03b5\u2080) on each side, pointing away from the plate for positive charge.\n\nBut since it's a conductor, the charges are on the outer surface.\n\nWait, but for a conductor, the electric field inside is zero, so the charges must arrange themselves to cancel any internal fields.\n\nSo, for a single plate, the charges are on the outer surface, and the electric field is \u03c3/(2\u03b5\u2080) on each side.\n\nBut in this problem, there are two plates.\n\nLet me consider the inner and outer surfaces of each plate.\n\nLet\u2019s label them:\n\n- Plate 1: Inner surface (facing plate 2) and outer surface (facing outward)\n\n- Plate 2: Inner surface (facing plate 1) and outer surface (facing outward)\n\nGiven that both plates have the same positive charge density \u03c3, the outer surfaces of both plates have \u03c3, and the inner surfaces also have \u03c3, because the plates are charged with equal surface charge density on all surfaces.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nActually, no. For isolated conductors, the charges reside only on the outer surfaces. The inner surfaces can have induced charges if there are external fields, but in this case, both plates are charged positively, and there's no mention of any external field.\n\nSo, each plate has a positive charge \u03c3 on its outer surface.\n\nNow, since they are conductors, the inner surfaces might have induced charges, but in this case, since both plates are positively charged, and they are parallel, I need to think about the interaction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's simpler to use Gauss's law to find the electric field between them.\n\nLet me consider a Gaussian surface between the two plates, say a rectangular box that encloses part of the space between them.\n\nThe electric field should be uniform between the plates, and by Gauss's law, the total flux through the Gaussian surface is equal to the charge enclosed divided by \u03b5\u2080.\n\nBut what's the charge enclosed?\n\nWait, both plates have positive charge density \u03c3, and they are parallel.\n\nActually, since they are conductors, the charges are on the outer surfaces.\n\nSo, the inner surfaces have no net charge, because the plates are positively charged overall, and the inner surfaces face each other, but since both are positively charged, there shouldn't be any induced charges on the inner surfaces.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. If both plates are positively charged, and they are close to each other, shouldn't there be some induced charges on the inner surfaces?\n\nActually, in reality, if both plates are positively charged, the positive charges on one plate would repel the positive charges on the other plate, but since they are conductors, the charges would rearrange to minimize energy.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look up how to treat two parallel charged plates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as two infinite sheets of charge, each with \u03c3, and since they are parallel and have the same polarity, their electric fields would add up in the region between them.\n\nAs I thought earlier, the electric field due to one plate is \u03c3/(2\u03b5\u2080) on each side, pointing away from the plate for positive charge.\n\nSo, in the region between the two plates, the field from plate 1 is \u03c3/(2\u03b5\u2080) towards plate 1, and the field from plate 2 is \u03c3/(2\u03b5\u2080) towards plate 2.\n\nWait, but if both plates are positively charged, the field from plate 1 points away from it, towards the region between the plates, and the field from plate 2 points away from it, towards the region between the plates.\n\nSo, in the region between them, both fields point in the same direction, towards the region outside both plates.\n\nTherefore, the total electric field in the gap is \u03c3/(2\u03b5\u2080) + \u03c3/(2\u03b5\u2080) = \u03c3/\u03b5\u2080.\n\nSo, that would be double the field produced by one plate.\n\nBut let me check another approach. Maybe using the principle of superposition.\n\nThe electric field due to a uniformly charged infinite plane is \u03c3/(2\u03b5\u2080), and it's independent of the distance from the plane.\n\nSo, for two such planes, their fields are just vectorially added at any point.\n\nIn the region between them, both fields point in the same direction, so their magnitudes add up.\n\nTherefore, the total electric field is \u03c3/\u03b5\u2080.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nBut wait, I recall that for two infinite parallel plates with opposite charges, the electric field between them is \u03c3/\u03b5\u2080, but in that case, the fields from each plate point towards the other plate, so they add up.\n\nIn this case, both plates have the same charge, so their fields point away from each other, but still in the same direction in the region between them.\n\nSo, again, they add up to \u03c3/\u03b5\u2080.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused now. If both plates have the same charge, shouldn't the electric field between them be zero, because the charges repel each other?\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense. The electric field is determined by the charges, not by their interaction forces.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think about the direction more carefully.\n\nLet me assume plate 1 is on the left, and plate 2 is on the right, both positively charged.\n\nThe electric field due to plate 1 points away from it, to the right in the region between the plates.\n\nThe electric field due to plate 2 points away from it, to the left in the region between the plates.\n\nSo, in the region between them, one field is to the right, and the other is to the left.\n\nTherefore, they would subtract, not add up.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought they add up. Which is it?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nFor plate 1, electric field points away from it, so to the right in the region between the plates.\n\nFor plate 2, electric field points away from it, so to the left in the region between the plates.\n\nTherefore, in the region between them, the fields are in opposite directions.\n\nSo, the net electric field would be \u03c3/(2\u03b5\u2080) to the right minus \u03c3/(2\u03b5\u2080) to the left, which is zero.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nLet me try to visualize it differently.\n\nSuppose I have two infinite planes, both positively charged.\n\nThe electric field due to one plane is \u03c3/(2\u03b5\u2080) on each side, pointing away from the plane.\n\nSo, in the region between them, the field from plate 1 is to the right, and from plate 2 is to the left.\n\nTherefore, they cancel each other out, resulting in a net electric field of zero between the plates.\n\nOutside both plates, the fields would add up, resulting in a net field of \u03c3/\u03b5\u2080 pointing away from the plates.\n\nSo, in this case, the electric field in the gap between the plates is zero.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was \u03c3/\u03b5\u2080.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nLet me check with Gauss's law again.\n\nConsider a Gaussian surface between the two plates, enclosing only the region between them.\n\nThe total charge enclosed would be the charge on the inner surfaces of the plates.\n\nBut since the plates are conductors and positively charged, the charges are on the outer surfaces.\n\nTherefore, the inner surfaces have no net charge, assuming no induced charges.\n\nTherefore, the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface is zero.\n\nTherefore, by Gauss's law, the total electric flux through the Gaussian surface is zero, which implies that the net electric field in the region between the plates is zero.\n\nAh, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the electric field between two infinite parallel plates with equal surface charge density of the same polarity is zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. zero.\n\nI must have been confused earlier by thinking of the fields adding up instead of canceling each other.\n\nLet me confirm this with another approach.\n\nSuppose both plates have positive charge density \u03c3.\n\nThen, the electric field due to plate 1 is \u03c3/(2\u03b5\u2080) away from plate 1, and due to plate 2 is \u03c3/(2\u03b5\u2080) away from plate 2.\n\nIn the region between them, the field from plate 1 is to the right, and from plate 2 is to the left.\n\nTherefore, they are in opposite directions and cancel each other out.\n\nHence, the net electric field in the gap is zero.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. zero.\n\nBut let's make sure there are no induced charges on the inner surfaces.\n\nIf both plates are positively charged, and they are conductors, the positive charges on one plate would repel the positive charges on the other plate.\n\nBut since they are conductors, the charges would rearrange.\n\nHowever, in the case of two infinite parallel plates with equal and same polarity charges, the inner surfaces should have zero net charge, because the plates are positively charged overall, and the charges are on the outer surfaces.\n\nTherefore, the inner surfaces have no net charge, and the electric field between them is zero.\n\nSo, the answer is D. zero.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{D}\\]"
