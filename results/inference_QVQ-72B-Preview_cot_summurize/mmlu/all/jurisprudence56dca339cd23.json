                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand Cicero's view on natural law, and it says here that his conception is based on the idea that \"true law is right reason in agreement with Nature.\" Okay, so reason and nature are key components here. The question is about the role of reason in this context, and there are four options:\n\nA. It is a sin for humans not to apply reason.\n\nB. The principles of natural law are discoverable by reason.\n\nC. Natural law does not apply without good reason.\n\nD. The law of nature is the basis of all positive law.\n\nFirst, I need to grasp what Cicero meant by \"right reason in agreement with Nature.\" From my understanding, Cicero was a Roman philosopher and statesman who was influenced by Greek philosophy, particularly Stoicism. The Stoics believed in a rational universe where natural law governs everything, and humans, being rational beings, can understand and align with this law.\n\nSo, in Cicero's view, true law is reasoned correctly and is in harmony with nature. That suggests that reason is a tool we use to comprehend and adhere to the natural order.\n\nLooking at option A: \"It is a sin for humans not to apply reason.\" Hmm, the concept of sin is more related to religious or moral transgressions. While Cicero did emphasize the importance of living in accordance with reason and nature, I don't recall him using the term \"sin\" in this context. Maybe he did, but I think there's a better option here.\n\nOption B: \"The principles of natural law are discoverable by reason.\" This seems plausible. If true law is right reason in agreement with nature, it implies that by using our reason, we can discover and understand these universal principles that govern nature and morality.\n\nOption C: \"Natural law does not apply without good reason.\" This one is a bit tricky. It seems to suggest that natural law is contingent upon having a good reason, but that doesn't quite align with Cicero's view. Natural law, according to Cicero, is eternal and unchanging; it applies whether we recognize it or not. So, perhaps this option is not the best fit.\n\nOption D: \"The law of nature is the basis of all positive law.\" This is also a significant aspect of Cicero's thought. He believed that human-made laws (positive laws) should be derived from and conform to the higher, unchanging natural law. So, in that sense, natural law is the foundation for all positive laws.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the role of reason in Cicero's conception of natural law. So, while option D is true, it's more about the relationship between natural law and positive law, not directly about the role of reason.\n\nLet me think again. The statement is that true law is right reason in agreement with nature. So, reason is being used to align with nature, and this alignment is what constitutes true law.\n\nOption B seems to capture that idea well: the principles of natural law can be discovered through reason. That makes sense because if natural law is rational and in harmony with nature, then using reason should allow us to understand and apply it.\n\nOption A, as I thought earlier, might be overreaching by introducing the concept of sin, which isn't central to Cicero's philosophy.\n\nOption C seems to suggest that natural law's applicability depends on having a good reason, which doesn't align with the idea that natural law is objective and universal, regardless of individual reasoning.\n\nOption D, while important, is more about the derivation of positive law from natural law, rather than the role of reason in understanding natural law.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is option B: the principles of natural law are discoverable by reason.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider Cicero's actual words. He wrote in \"On the Laws\":\n\n\"True law is right reason in agreement with nature; it is of universal application, unchanging and everlasting; it cannot be altered either by senate or by popular assembly \u2014 nor can it be repealed by rulers; and it is not nullified by neglect.\"\n\nFrom this quote, it's clear that natural law is based on reason and is in harmony with nature. It's universal and unchanging. So, reason is the faculty that allows us to understand and recognize this law.\n\nAnother quote from Cicero: \"To know nothing of what happened before you were born, is to forever remain a child.\"\n\nThis emphasizes the importance of knowledge and reason in understanding the world and our place in it.\n\nTherefore, it's reasonable to conclude that in Cicero's view, reason is the means by which humans can discover and understand the principles of natural law.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The principles of natural law are discoverable by reason.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
