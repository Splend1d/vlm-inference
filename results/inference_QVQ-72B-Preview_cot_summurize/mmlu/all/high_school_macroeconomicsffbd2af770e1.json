                    "text": "Let's see here. So, the problem says that in Sherwood, the average price level tripled, and Robin's income increased from $30,000 to $60,000. I need to figure out what happened to his nominal and real income. The options are:\n\nA. Nominal income increased, real income decreased\n\nB. Nominal income increased, real income increased\n\nC. Nominal income decreased, real income decreased\n\nD. Nominal income increased, real income stayed the same\n\nFirst, I should understand what nominal and real income mean. Nominal income is the amount of money you make before adjusting for inflation, while real income adjusts for inflation and gives a sense of how much your purchasing power is.\n\nSo, nominal income here clearly increased from $30,000 to $60,000. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, the average price level tripled. That means things cost three times as much as they used to. So, if prices tripled, and his income went from $30,000 to $60,000, did his real income increase, decrease, or stay the same?\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nIf prices tripled, that means that each dollar can buy only one-third of what it could before. So, if his income had just tripled, his purchasing power would stay the same because both his income and prices tripled.\n\nBut his income went from $30,000 to $60,000, which is a doubling, while prices tripled.\n\nWait, no. Actually, prices tripled means that the price index went up to three times its original level.\n\nLet me try to calculate this.\n\nLet's say originally, the price level was P. Now it's 3P.\n\nHis original income was $30,000, now it's $60,000.\n\nReal income would be nominal income adjusted for the price level. So, real income = nominal income / price level.\n\nOriginally, real income was $30,000 / P.\n\nNow, it's $60,000 / (3P) = $20,000 / P.\n\nSo, comparing to the original real income of $30,000 / P, the new real income is $20,000 / P.\n\nThat means real income decreased.\n\nSo, nominal income increased (from $30,000 to $60,000), but real income decreased (from $30,000 / P to $20,000 / P).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A: Increased, Decreased.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to look at it: if prices tripled, to maintain the same purchasing power, his income should have tripled as well, right? Because if prices are three times higher, he needs three times the money to buy the same things.\n\nOriginally, he could buy X amount of goods with $30,000.\n\nNow, to buy the same X, he would need 3 times that, which is $90,000.\n\nBut his income only went up to $60,000, which is less than $90,000, so his purchasing power decreased.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, nominal income increased (from $30,000 to $60,000), but real income decreased because he needed $90,000 to maintain the same purchasing power.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
