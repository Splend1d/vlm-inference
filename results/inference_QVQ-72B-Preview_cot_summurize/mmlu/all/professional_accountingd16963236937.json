                    "text": "So I have this problem about depreciation using the double-declining balance method. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the double-declining balance method is. I think it's an accelerated depreciation method where you depreciate the asset more in the early years of its life. The \"double\" part means that it's twice the straight-line depreciation rate.\n\nSo, the straight-line depreciation rate would be 1 divided by the useful life in years. Here, the useful life is 8 years, so the straight-line rate is 1/8 = 12.5% per year. Double that would be 25% per year.\n\nWait, but I should confirm if there's a salvage value involved. In the straight-line method, we usually subtract the salvage value from the cost to find the depreciable amount. But in the double-declining balance method, I think we apply the rate to the book value at the beginning of each period, and the salvage value might not be directly considered until the end.\n\nLet me check that. Yeah, in the double-declining balance method, the depreciation is calculated each year by multiplying the book value at the beginning of the year by the fixed rate, which is twice the straight-line rate. And we continue doing this until the book value approaches the salvage value.\n\nSo, here's what I have:\n\n- Cost of the machine: $140,000\n\n- Estimated useful life: 8 years\n\n- Salvage value: $60,000\n\n- Depreciation method: double-declining balance\n\nFirst, find the straight-line depreciation rate: 1/8 = 12.5%\n\nThen, the double-declining balance rate: 2 * 12.5% = 25% per year\n\nNow, let's calculate the depreciation for the first year.\n\nYear 1:\n\nDepreciation = 25% of $140,000 = 0.25 * 140,000 = $35,000\n\nBook value at the end of year 1: $140,000 - $35,000 = $105,000\n\nNow, year 2:\n\nDepreciation = 25% of $105,000 = 0.25 * 105,000 = $26,250\n\nBook value at the end of year 2: $105,000 - $26,250 = $78,750\n\nWait a minute, that's one of the options\u2014C. $78,750.\n\nBut I need to make sure that this is correct and that I haven't missed anything.\n\nLet me verify again.\n\nInitial cost: $140,000\n\nYear 1 depreciation: 25% of 140,000 = 35,000\n\nBook value end of year 1: 140,000 - 35,000 = 105,000\n\nYear 2 depreciation: 25% of 105,000 = 26,250\n\nBook value end of year 2: 105,000 - 26,250 = 78,750\n\nSeems straightforward. But I should check if there's any involvement of the salvage value in these calculations.\n\nIn the double-declining balance method, the salvage value isn't directly considered in the annual depreciation calculations. The depreciation continues until the book value is equal to the salvage value or very close to it.\n\nGiven that the salvage value is $60,000, and after two years the book value is $78,750, which is still higher than the salvage value, it's acceptable to continue depreciating at the double-declining rate.\n\nI don't see any reason to switch to another method yet, as the book value hasn't reached the salvage value.\n\nTherefore, the carrying amount at the end of the second year should be $78,750.\n\nWait, but option D is $80,000. That seems higher than what I calculated.\n\nLet me see how $80,000 was obtained.\n\nMaybe someone used a different depreciation rate or miscalculated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they used the straight-line depreciation.\n\nLet me calculate the straight-line depreciation for comparison.\n\nStraight-line depreciation per year: (cost - salvage value) / useful life\n\n= ($140,000 - $60,000) / 8 years\n\n= $80,000 / 8\n\n= $10,000 per year\n\nSo, after two years, the accumulated depreciation would be $20,000\n\nBook value: $140,000 - $20,000 = $120,000\n\nBut that's not matching any of the options, and it's different from what I calculated earlier using the double-declining balance method.\n\nThis reinforces that the double-declining balance method leads to a different book value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach to calculating the double-declining balance depreciation.\n\nLet me consider if there's a switch to straight-line when the depreciation amount becomes less than the double-declining balance.\n\nBut in this case, after year 2, the book value is $78,750.\n\nIf we calculate year 3 depreciation:\n\n25% of $78,750 = $19,687.50\n\nBook value end of year 3: $78,750 - 19,687.50 = $59,062.50\n\nWhich is still above the salvage value of $60,000. Wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait a second, $59,062.50 is less than the salvage value of $60,000. That doesn't make sense.\n\nIn that case, the book value shouldn't be less than the salvage value.\n\nSo, in year 3, instead of depreciating $19,687.50, we should depreciate only $59,062.50 - $60,000 = -$937.50, which doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, in year 3, the depreciation expense should be limited to $78,750 - $60,000 = $18,750.\n\nSo, the depreciation for year 3 would be $18,750, not $19,687.50.\n\nBut since we're only asking for the end of year 2, and assuming no switch to straight-line yet, the carrying amount should still be $78,750.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation of the double-declining balance method.\n\nLet me consider the formula for the double-declining balance depreciation.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nDepreciation expense = Book value at beginning of year * (2 / useful life in years)\n\nIn this case, 2 / 8 = 0.25 or 25%, which matches what I used earlier.\n\nSo, applying this formula for years 1 and 2 gives the same results as before.\n\nYear 1: $140,000 * 0.25 = $35,000\n\nYear 2: $105,000 * 0.25 = $26,250\n\nBook value end of year 2: $140,000 - $35,000 - $26,250 = $78,750\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone calculated using a different method or made an arithmetic error.\n\nLet me see option D: $80,000.\n\nIs there any way to get $80,000 using the double-declining balance method?\n\nWait, perhaps they forgot to subtract the depreciation in the second year.\n\nLet me check:\n\nIf they only depreciated $35,000 in the first year and didn't account for the second year depreciation, the book value would be $140,000 - $35,000 = $105,000, which is still higher than $80,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they miscalculated the second year depreciation.\n\nIf they took 25% of $105,000 as $26,250, then $105,000 - $26,250 = $78,750, which again is not $80,000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they used a different depreciation rate.\n\nWait, maybe they used the declining balance rate without doubling it.\n\nLet's see what that would be.\n\nThe declining balance rate is the straight-line rate times some factor, typically double, which is 25% as I calculated.\n\nIf they used the straight-line rate of 12.5%, then:\n\nYear 1 depreciation: $140,000 * 0.125 = $17,500\n\nYear 2 depreciation: $122,500 * 0.125 = $15,312.50\n\nBook value end of year 2: $140,000 - $17,500 - $15,312.50 = $107,187.50\n\nWhich is not $80,000 either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they used a different factor for the declining balance rate.\n\nPerhaps they used three times the straight-line rate, which would be 37.5%.\n\nThen, year 1 depreciation: $140,000 * 0.375 = $52,500\n\nYear 2 depreciation: $87,500 * 0.375 = $32,812.50\n\nBook value end of year 2: $140,000 - $52,500 - $32,812.50 = $54,687.50\n\nStill not $80,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they used the sum-of-the-years'-digits method instead.\n\nSum of years' digits for 8 years: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 36\n\nYear 1 depreciation: ($140,000 - $60,000) * (8/36) = $80,000 * (8/36) \u2248 $17,777.78\n\nYear 2 depreciation: $80,000 * (7/36) \u2248 $15,555.56\n\nBook value end of year 2: $140,000 - $17,777.78 - $15,555.56 \u2248 $106,666.66\n\nNot $80,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they used straight-line depreciation without considering the salvage value.\n\nStraight-line without salvage: $140,000 / 8 = $17,500 per year\n\nAfter two years: $140,000 - $35,000 = $105,000\n\nStill not $80,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they used the formula for straight-line depreciation considering the salvage value.\n\nAs I did earlier: ($140,000 - $60,000) / 8 = $10,000 per year\n\nAfter two years: $140,000 - $20,000 = $120,000\n\nNot $80,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they used the reducing balance method without doubling the rate.\n\nReducing balance rate: straight-line rate * depreciation factor (which is 2 in this case)\n\nIf they used 1 times the straight-line rate, it would be the same as straight-line depreciation, which we already calculated as $120,000 after two years.\n\nStill not $80,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they used the wrong useful life.\n\nIf they used a useful life of 10 years instead of 8, the straight-line rate would be 10%, and double that would be 20%.\n\nThen, year 1 depreciation: $140,000 * 0.20 = $28,000\n\nYear 2 depreciation: $112,000 * 0.20 = $22,400\n\nBook value end of year 2: $140,000 - $28,000 - $22,400 = $89,600\n\nStill not $80,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they used the wrong cost or salvage value.\n\nIf they used a cost of $160,000 and a salvage value of $80,000, but that's not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they misread the question and considered only one year instead of two.\n\nIf only one year:\n\nDepreciation: $140,000 * 0.25 = $35,000\n\nBook value end of year 1: $140,000 - $35,000 = $105,000\n\nStill not $80,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they used the wrong depreciation method altogether.\n\nGiven all this, I think $80,000 is likely a distractor, and the correct answer should be $78,750, which is option C.\n\nTherefore, the carrying amount at the end of the second year is $78,750.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
