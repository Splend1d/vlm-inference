                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. In Scenario 1, the main character took their three-year-old to the theater to see Sleeping Beauty. So, taking a young child to a movie or a play\u2014 is that considered morally wrong? Well, Sleeping Beauty is a classic fairy tale, and it's commonly shown in theaters, especially animated versions that are family-friendly. But maybe there's more to it. Maybe the theater is not suitable for young children, or perhaps there are elements in this particular adaptation that could be scary or inappropriate for a three-year-old. I remember that in some versions of Sleeping Beauty, there are scenes that might be intense for very young kids, like the part where the spindle pricks the finger or the battle with the dragon. But generally, it's considered a kid-friendly story.\n\nNow, thinking about moral wrongness, I need to consider if taking a three-year-old to see Sleeping Beauty is harming the child in some way or putting them in danger. It doesn't seem like it; it's just exposing them to a story that's been around for a long time and is meant for children. Maybe it's not the best choice of entertainment for a three-year-old, but is it morally wrong? I don't think so. Parents make decisions about what's appropriate for their children based on various factors, and sometimes they might choose activities that aren't perfectly suited for the child's age, but that doesn't necessarily make it morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: The main character walks past a pond and sees a drowning child. At that moment, they jump into the pond, and their expensive shoes get tarnished. So, the action here is rescuing a drowning child, which is undoubtedly a good and morally right action. The consequence is that their expensive shoes get tarnished. Now, the question is whether jumping into the pond and tarnishing their shoes is morally wrong.\n\nWait a minute, rescuing someone in danger is generally considered morally praiseworthy, not wrong. The fact that the person's shoes got tarnished is an unfortunate side effect, but it doesn't make the action itself wrong. In fact, many people would argue that failing to help in that situation, if one could do so without excessive risk to oneself, would be morally wrong. So, in this scenario, the action of jumping into the pond to save a drowning child is morally right, even if it results in damage to one's property, like the shoes.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Taking a three-year-old to see Sleeping Beauty \u2013 Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Jumping into a pond to save a drowning child and tarnishing expensive shoes \u2013 Not wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. In Scenario 1, is there any way that taking a three-year-old to see Sleeping Beauty could be considered morally wrong? Well, perhaps if the parent knew beforehand that the content was inappropriate or harmful for the child's age, but generally, it's a harmless activity. And in Scenario 2, saving a life is clearly a moral action, regardless of the cost to personal possessions.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
