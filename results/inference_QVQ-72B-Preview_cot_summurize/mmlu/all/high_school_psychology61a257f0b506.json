                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which technique an artist could use to add depth to a pencil drawing. The options are retinal disparity, convergence, closure, and linear perspective. Let me think about each one.\n\nFirst, retinal disparity. I remember from psychology class that retinal disparity is when our two eyes see slightly different images because they're positioned differently in our heads. Our brain combines these images to give us a sense of depth. But since a drawing is two-dimensional, it's just one image. So, I don't think the artist can create retinal disparity in a drawing. Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems like something that only works with binocular vision in real life.\n\nNext, convergence. That's when our eyes turn inward as we look at objects that are close to us. Again, this is something that happens with our eyes in real time. In a drawing, it's just a static image, so I don't see how convergence would apply here. Maybe if the artist draws eyes looking inwards, but that wouldn't necessarily add depth to the overall drawing. Hmm.\n\nClosure. This one is about how we tend to see incomplete shapes as complete. Like, if there's a circle with a gap, we still perceive it as a circle. I can see how an artist might use this to suggest forms without drawing every detail, but I'm not sure if it directly adds depth to the drawing. It might make the drawing more engaging by letting the viewer's mind fill in the gaps, but again, not sure about depth specifically.\n\nLastly, linear perspective. This sounds promising. Linear perspective is a technique artists use to create the illusion of depth on a flat surface. It involves drawing parallel lines that seem to converge in the distance at one or more vanishing points. Think of railway tracks that appear to come closer together as they go into the distance. This definitely seems like a way to add depth to a drawing.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"could use which of the following techniques.\" It's possible that more than one could be used, but looking at the options, linear perspective seems the most straightforward way to add depth in a drawing.\n\nLet me double-check. Is there any way an artist could incorporate retinal disparity or convergence into a drawing to suggest depth? Retinal disparity is about the difference in images seen by each eye, which is hard to replicate in a single drawing unless it's a stereogram or something, which isn't typical for a pencil drawing.\n\nConvergence of the eyes might be depicted in a drawing to suggest that an object is close to the viewer, but it's more about indicating the distance of the object based on how much the eyes are turned inward. It's not a general technique for adding depth to the entire drawing.\n\nClosure is more about completeness of shapes and doesn't directly relate to depth perception.\n\nSo, considering all this, linear perspective is the most appropriate technique an artist can use to add depth to a pencil drawing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D}} \\]"
