The state authorities based their refusal on state statute, which provided:\"No person shall become a member of the state police unless he/she shall be a citizen of the United States. \"Thus, under this provision, as a prerequisite to becoming a member of the state police, an alien must relinquish his foreign citizenship and become a citizen.

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario here about a permanent resident alien who wants to become a state trooper, but the state has a statute that says only U.S. citizens can apply. The state's Attorney General thinks this is okay because police officers are involved in executing public policy, and thus should be citizens. The alien can't apply for citizenship yet because there's a five-year residency requirement, and he's only been here for two years. Now, if he sues in federal court, what's the most likely outcome?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal issues at play here. The state has a law that restricts certain jobs\u2014specifically state troopers\u2014to U.S. citizens. The alien is a permanent resident but not a citizen, and he can't become a citizen for another three years due to federal law. So, he's challenging the constitutionality of the state statute.\n\nI need to think about what constitutional principles apply here. The Fourteenth Amendment comes to mind, especially the equal protection clause, which says that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. So, if the state is treating this alien differently based on his citizenship status, that could be a violation of equal protection.\n\nBut wait, citizenship might be a legitimate basis for distinguishing between different classes of people, especially in matters related to government employment. After all, being a police officer is a significant public role, involving law enforcement and policy execution.\n\nLet me consider the state's rationale. The Attorney General notes that police officers participate directly in executing broad public policy, so only citizens should be qualified to apply for such positions. That sounds like a rational basis for the restriction. Citizens have a vested interest in the country and its policies, having gone through the naturalization process or being born here.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether this distinction is necessary and whether there are less restrictive means to achieve the state's objectives. Maybe the state could require some other form of loyalty or commitment from permanent residents rather than excluding them entirely from applying.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the Supreme Court's precedents on this issue. I recall that in Sugarman v. Dougall, the Court struck down a state law that barred non-citizens from holding public office, including teaching positions in public schools. But that was about holding public office, not about being a police officer, which might be seen differently due to the nature of the job.\n\nWait, in Foley v. Connelie, the Court upheld a state law that required new hires in the state police to be U.S. citizens. But in that case, the Court held that citizenship was a permissible qualification for such positions because of the sensitive nature of law enforcement duties and the close association of state police with the community.\n\nHmm, that seems relevant. So, perhaps the Court has already ruled on a similar issue and found that citizenship is a rational requirement for state police officers.\n\nLet me think about the different options given:\n\nA. Constitutional, because the statute is within the state's plenary power to regulate the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.\n\nPlenary power refers to the state's broad authority to regulate matters within its borders, subject to constitutional limits. While states do have police powers to regulate health, safety, and welfare, these powers aren't absolute and must comply with the U.S. Constitution, including the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause.\n\nSo, even if the state has plenary power in these areas, that doesn't mean it can pass any law it wants without considering constitutional constraints. Therefore, this option might not be accurate because it overlooks the need to comply with equal protection principles.\n\nB. Constitutional, because citizenship bears a rational relationship to the special demands of the police function.\n\nThis seems to align with the state's argument and the Attorney General's opinion. The idea is that being a citizen ensures a certain level of commitment and loyalty to the country, which is important for someone who will be enforcing laws and representing the state as a police officer.\n\nGiven that police officers have significant discretion and power, it might be reasonable for the state to require citizenship as a prerequisite for such a position. This could be seen as a rational basis for the discrimination, making the law constitutional under the equal protection clause.\n\nC. Unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThis option suggests that the law is invalid because it treats permanent resident aliens differently without a sufficient governmental interest. However, based on the state's rationale and possible Supreme Court precedent, it seems that there might be a rational basis for the citizenship requirement, which would make the law constitutional under equal protection scrutiny.\n\nUnless there's a stronger argument against the law, I don't think this option is the most likely outcome.\n\nD. Unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe due process clause protects against arbitrary deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. While the law might affect the alien's ability to pursue a certain career, it's not immediately clear how it violates due process.\n\nRestricting certain jobs to citizens might be seen as a reasonable exercise of state power, especially in positions that involve law enforcement and public safety. Therefore, it's unlikely that the court would find this law violative of due process.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most likely outcome is that the court will declare the statute constitutional, either because it's within the state's plenary power (option A) or because citizenship bears a rational relationship to the special demands of the police function (option B).\n\nBut between A and B, I think B is a better justification because it directly addresses the equal protection issue by providing a rational basis for the discrimination based on citizenship.\n\nOption A is too broad and doesn't specifically address the equal protection concerns. Plenary power doesn't automatically override constitutional protections.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B: constitutional, because citizenship bears a rational relationship to the special demands of the police function.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
