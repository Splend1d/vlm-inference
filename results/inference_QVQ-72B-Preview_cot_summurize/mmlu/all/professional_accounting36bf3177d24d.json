                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Strom acquiring a partnership interest in Ace Partnership by contributing some land. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nStrom contributes land that he has an adjusted basis of $16,000, but the fair market value is $50,000. So, the land is worth a lot more than what he's been keeping on his books. That makes sense.\n\nBut there's a mortgage on this land, $24,000, and Ace Partnership is assuming that mortgage. So, basically, Ace is taking over that debt when they get the land.\n\nI need to find out what Strom's basis in Ace Partnership is after this contribution.\n\nFirst, I remember that when someone contributes property to a partnership, the basis of the partner's interest in the partnership generally includes the adjusted basis of the property contributed, adjusted for any gain or loss recognized on the contribution.\n\nBut in this case, it's a contribution of property in exchange for a partnership interest, and there's debt involved because of the mortgage.\n\nLet me recall IRS rules on this. I think there's a section in the tax code that deals with the basis of property contributed to a partnership.\n\nSection 721 of the Internal Revenue Code says that no gain or loss is recognized to a partner who contributes property to a partnership in exchange for an interest in the partnership. So, Strom shouldn't have to recognize any gain on this contribution, even though the fair market value is higher than his adjusted basis.\n\nBut, there's a mortgage involved, which is a liability. I think liabilities assumed by the partnership also affect the partner's basis.\n\nLet me look up the rules again.\n\nAccording to IRS regulations, when a partnership assumes a liability of a contributing partner, the amount of the liability is treated as a cash distribution to the partner for basis calculation purposes.\n\nSo, in this case, Ace Partnership is assuming a $24,000 mortgage on the land that Strom is contributing. That means Strom is effectively being relieved of that $24,000 debt.\n\nFor Strom's basis in the partnership, I need to take his adjusted basis in the property contributed and subtract any liabilities that the partnership takes over.\n\nSo, Strom's adjusted basis in the land is $16,000, and the partnership is assuming a $24,000 liability.\n\nWait a minute, if I subtract $24,000 from $16,000, I get negative $8,000. That doesn't make sense for a basis.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nThe general rule is that the basis of a partner's interest in a partnership is equal to the adjusted basis of the property contributed, plus any gain recognized, minus any loss recognized, and adjusted for any liabilities.\n\nIn this case, no gain or loss is recognized, so those terms drop out.\n\nBut the partnership is assuming a liability, which is like a deemed cash distribution to Strom.\n\nSo, Strom's basis in the partnership should be his adjusted basis in the property contributed minus the amount of the liability assumed by the partnership.\n\nSo, $16,000 minus $24,000 equals negative $8,000.\n\nBut you can't have a negative basis, can you?\n\nI think that in some cases, if the basis calculation results in a negative number, the basis is simply zero.\n\nSo, Strom's basis in Ace Partnership would be zero.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that Strom is contributing property with a basis of $16,000, and the partnership is assuming a liability of $24,000.\n\nThe deemed cash distribution is $24,000, which reduces his basis by that amount.\n\nBut since his basis can't go below zero, it would be zero.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. $0.\n\nWait, but let's see if there's any other consideration.\n\nIs there any other factor that could affect Strom's basis in the partnership?\n\nNo, I don't think so.\n\nSo, Strom's basis in Ace Partnership is $0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 0} \\]"
