The way things should be. D. The way things were. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I remember that \"normative\" has something to do with standards or rules that dictate how things ought to be. So, it's probably about what should be done or what is ideal, rather than describing reality as it is.\n\nLet me think about this. In economics, there's a distinction between positive and normative economics. Positive economics is about facts and descriptions, like \"the unemployment rate is 5%,\" which is about how things are\u2014so that sounds like option A. Normative economics, on the other hand, is about values and prescriptions, like \"the government should reduce unemployment,\" which is more about how things should be\u2014option C.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. So, normative perspectives are about what ought to be or what is desirable, based on certain values or ethical considerations. It's not about predicting the future, which would be option B, or looking back at the past, which is option D.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider other fields. In ethics, normative ethics is concerned with moral standards and principles that guide our actions. It's about determining what is right or wrong, good or bad\u2014again, focusing on how things should be, not how they are.\n\nIn law, normative legal theory deals with what the law ought to be, perhaps based on moral or social ideals, rather than describing the actual laws in place. So, again, it's about the ideal state or what should be.\n\nI think I'm reinforcing my initial thought that a normative perspective is about the way things should be, which is option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options again. Option A is \"the way things are,\" which seems more aligned with descriptive or positive perspectives. For example, in social sciences, descriptive studies observe and describe phenomena without making judgments about what should be.\n\nOption B is \"the way things are going to be.\" That sounds like prediction or forecasting, which is more about using current data to predict future outcomes, not about prescribing what ought to be.\n\nOption D is \"the way things were,\" which refers to history or past events. While understanding the past can inform our present decisions, normative perspectives are more forward-looking, focusing on what should be done now or in the future based on certain values.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I'm confident that option C, \"the way things should be,\" is the correct answer for a normative perspective.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
