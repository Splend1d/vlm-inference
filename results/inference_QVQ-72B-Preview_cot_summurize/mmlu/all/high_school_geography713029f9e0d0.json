                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which urban model describes high-rent residential areas growing outward from the center of the city along major highways, with lower-rent inhabitants taking over sequentially. The options are the concentric zone model, the central place model, the urban realms model, and the sector model.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these models represents. Starting with the concentric zone model, I think it's about circles of development radiating out from the city center, like rings in a tree trunk. Each zone represents different types of land use, with higher-class residential areas further out from the center.\n\nNext, the central place model seems to be more about the distribution of services and the hierarchy of cities based on their size and the services they offer. It's not directly about residential zones growing along highways, so maybe this isn't the right fit for the description provided.\n\nThen there's the urban realms model. I believe this model divides the city into different sectors or areas based on various characteristics like economic activity, social class, or ethnicity. It might be too broad for this specific description.\n\nLastly, there's the sector model. From what I remember, this model suggests that cities develop in sectors that extend outward from the center along lines of growth, like major transportation routes or highways. These sectors can be associated with different social groups or economic classes.\n\nGiven this, the sector model seems to align closely with the description provided. It talks about high-rent residential areas growing outward from the center along major highways, with lower-rent inhabitants taking over sequentially. This sounds like a process where more affluent groups move out along these highways, and as they do, less affluent groups move into the areas they leave behind.\n\nTo make sure I'm not missing something, let's consider each option again:\n\n- Concentric zone model: While it does have zones of different socioeconomic statuses, it's more about circular rings rather than sectors along specific axes like highways.\n\n- Central place model: This is more about the spatial organization of cities and towns based on the provision of goods and services, not specifically about residential development along highways.\n\n- Urban realms model: This seems to be more about the functional regions within a city, possibly including industrial, residential, commercial, etc., but not specifically about residential growth along highways.\n\n- Sector model: This model explicitly suggests that cities grow in sectors along lines of growth, such as major highways, with different socioeconomic groups occupying different sectors.\n\nBased on this analysis, the sector model appears to be the most appropriate choice for the description given. It directly relates to the idea of residential areas growing outward along specific pathways like highways, with a sequential takeover by different income groups.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll think about the key features of the sector model. It was developed by Homer Hoyt in the 1930s and proposes that urban land use is arranged in sectors that extend outward from the center along lines of easiest access, often following major transportation routes. These sectors can be associated with different social groups, with higher-income groups moving out along these sectors and lower-income groups following behind, occupying the areas that the higher-income groups have left.\n\nYes, this matches perfectly with the description provided. Therefore, the correct answer should be D. Sector model.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
