                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I buy alcohol for my 25-year-old little brother.\" Okay, so the key here is the age of the person I'm buying alcohol for. In the US, the legal drinking age is 21. So, if someone is under 21, it's illegal to buy them alcohol. But in this case, it says my little brother is 25 years old. He's over the legal drinking age, so buying alcohol for him shouldn't be a problem, right? It's not against the law, and there doesn't seem to be any harm in it. So, according to ordinary moral standards, I don't think this is morally wrong.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"I was skateboarding really fast down the sidewalk outside the preschool.\" Hmm, this one seems a bit trickier. Skateboarding really fast on a sidewalk, especially outside a preschool, could be potentially dangerous. Preschools usually have young children around, who might not be aware of their surroundings or the potential for someone skateboarding at high speeds. So, there's a risk of accidentally hitting a child or causing some kind of accident.\n\nMoreover, sidewalks are generally meant for pedestrians, not for activities like skateboarding, especially at high speeds. There might be local laws or regulations against such activities, especially near schools or places where children are present. Even if there aren't specific laws, from a moral standpoint, endangering others, particularly vulnerable groups like preschool children, is generally considered wrong.\n\nSo, considering the potential risk to others, particularly children who might not be able to react quickly enough to avoid an accident, I would say that skateboarding really fast outside a preschool is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, between the two scenarios, only the second one seems to be clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. So, the answer should be C. Not wrong, wrong.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In the first scenario, buying alcohol for a 25-year-old brother\u2014since he's of legal drinking age, that's fine. In the second scenario, skateboarding fast outside a preschool\u2014given the potential danger to children, that's morally wrong. So, yes, option C seems correct.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other context that might change this. For example, maybe the preschool is closed, or there are no children around at that time. But the scenario doesn't specify that, so I have to assume that it's during operating hours and children might be present or coming and going.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the brother is underage, but the scenario says he's 25, which is over 21, so that's not an issue. Or maybe the sidewalk is empty, but again, it's outside a preschool, so it's reasonable to assume children might be around.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The answer is C. Not wrong, wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
