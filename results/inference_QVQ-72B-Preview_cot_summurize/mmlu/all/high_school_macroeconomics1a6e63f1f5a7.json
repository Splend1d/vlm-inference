                    "text": "So I've got this question here about cameras and how production has shifted from 35-mm cameras to digital cameras over the last 20 years. It's asking what this trend is an example of, and there are four options to choose from. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The question is about the change in production from one type of camera to another due to market forces. It's not about central planners deciding what to produce, so option A seems unlikely. But just to be sure, let's think about each option.\n\nOption A says it's an example of how central planners dictate which cameras are produced. Central planners are like government officials or agencies that decide what should be produced in an economy. But in the context of the last 20 years, especially in many developed countries, the camera industry is largely driven by market forces rather than government planning. So, this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nOption B says it's the market system answering the question of \"how\" cameras should be produced. The \"how\" in economics refers to the methods and technologies used in production. While it's true that shifting to digital cameras involves different production methods, the question seems more about what is being produced rather than how it's produced. So, maybe not the best fit.\n\nOption D says it's the market system answering the question of \"who\" should consume the cameras that are produced. This relates to distribution\u2014who gets the products. Again, the question is more about the type of cameras being produced, not about who buys them. So, probably not the right answer.\n\nThat leaves option C: the market system answering the question of \"what\" cameras should be produced. This seems to align closely with the scenario described. The market is determining that there's a shift in demand from 35-mm cameras to digital cameras, and firms are responding by producing more digital cameras and fewer 35-mm cameras.\n\nTo make sure, let's recall the basic economic questions:\n\n1. What to produce?\n\n2. How to produce it?\n\n3. For whom to produce it?\n\nThe question at hand is about the \"what\" to produce, which is being answered by the market system through consumer preferences and producer responses.\n\nAdditionally, considering the last 20 years, digital technology has advanced significantly, making digital cameras more desirable to consumers. As demand for digital cameras increased and demand for 35-mm cameras decreased, firms naturally shifted their production to align with consumer preferences.\n\nThis is a classic example of the market system at work, where producers respond to consumer demands by adjusting their production decisions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. the market system answering the question of \"what\" cameras should be produced.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if there's any possibility that another option could also be correct. For instance, could this also be seen as the market answering the \"how\" question? Well, yes, producing digital cameras involves different technology and production methods compared to 35-mm cameras. However, the primary focus of the question is on the type of product being produced, not on the production methods themselves. So, while there is some overlap, the main issue here is what to produce, not how.\n\nHence, option C remains the most appropriate answer.\n\nIn conclusion, the trend of producing fewer 35-mm cameras and more digital cameras is an example of the market system answering the question of \"what\" cameras should be produced.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
