He admits to intentionally burning his right thigh multiple times with a cigarette lighter six days ago. This morning, he soaked his thigh in hot water and massaged it, and after that, a large amount of greenish fluid drained from the wound sites. He usually takes lithium carbonate but stopped taking it three months ago after losing his job. His vital signs show a temperature of 39.2\u00b0C (102.5\u00b0F), a pulse of 170/min, respirations at 18/min, and a blood pressure of 120/60 mm Hg. On examination, his right lateral thigh is edematous with multiple burn sites that have a white exudative appearance. There's erythema surrounding these burns with red streaks extending up the thigh. When they palpate the burn sites, they feel fluctuance. His lab tests show a hemoglobin of 14 g/dL and a leukocyte count of 19,000/mm3. The question is, besides starting antibiotic therapy, what's the next best step?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, the patient has a history of self-mutilation, which is important to note. He burned his thigh multiple times with a cigarette lighter and then soaked it in hot water and massaged it, which likely introduced infection. Now he's presenting with signs of infection: pain, shaking chills, fever, tachycardia, and an elevated white blood cell count. The burn sites have a white exudate, which could be pus, and there's erythema with red streaks extending up the thigh, which suggests cellulitis or possibly lymphangitis. The fluctuance on palpation indicates there might be a collection of fluid or abscess formation.\n\nSo, primary concerns here are infected burn wounds possibly leading to a deeper soft tissue infection or sepsis. Given the high fever and tachycardia, this seems like a pretty severe infection.\n\nOptions given are:\n\nA. Incision and drainage\n\nB. Psychiatric consultation\n\nC. Topical silver sulfadiazine\n\nD. Transfer to a burn center\n\nLet's consider each one.\n\nFirst, incision and drainage (I&D). This is a common procedure for managing abscesses. Given that there's fluctuance on palpation, which suggests an abscess, I&D would be a appropriate step to drain the infected material and possibly send it for culture to guide antibiotic therapy. So, this seems like a reasonable option.\n\nNext, psychiatric consultation. The patient has a history of self-mutilation and stopped taking his lithium carbonate, which is used to treat bipolar disorder, among other things. So, there might be a need for psychiatric evaluation, especially since he's stopped his medication. However, in the context of a severe infection, addressing the immediate life-threatening issue might take priority over psychiatric consultation at this exact moment. That said, psychiatric care is important for his underlying condition, but it's not the most urgent intervention right now.\n\nTopical silver sulfadiazine is commonly used for burn wounds to prevent infection. Given that the patient has burn wounds that are infected, using a topical antibiotic like silver sulfadiazine could help control the infection. However, since there's already a significant infection with possible abscess formation, topical treatment might not be sufficient on its own. It might be part of the treatment plan, but likely in combination with systemic antibiotics and possibly surgical intervention.\n\nLastly, transfer to a burn center. This is a specialized facility equipped to handle severe burns and their complications. Given that the patient has multiple burn wounds that are infected and possibly leading to a deeper soft tissue infection, transferring him to a burn center could be beneficial for specialized care. However, in an emergency situation where the patient is showing signs of severe infection and possibly sepsis, stabilizing his condition first might be necessary before transferring him.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the most appropriate next step is incision and drainage. This would help relieve the pressure from the abscess, reduce the burden of infection, and allow for culture-guided antibiotic therapy. Additionally, starting broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics would be crucial to manage the severe infection and prevent sepsis.\n\nPsychiatric consultation is important for his underlying mental health issues, but it's not the most urgent intervention at this moment. Topical silver sulfadiazine could be part of the treatment plan, but it's not sufficient on its own for the current severity of the infection. Transfer to a burn center might be necessary, but again, stabilizing the patient first is paramount.\n\nTherefore, I would go with option A: incision and drainage, coupled with the initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy based on the suspected pathogens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
