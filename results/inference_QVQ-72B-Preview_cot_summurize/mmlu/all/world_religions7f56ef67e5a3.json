                    "text": "So I have this question about Sikhism. It's asking which Guru donned the two swords symbolizing temporal and spiritual authority. The options are Guru Nanak, Guru Arjan, Guru Hargobind, and Guru Ram Das. I need to figure out the correct answer among these.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what \"temporal and spiritual authority\" means. Temporal authority refers to worldly or secular power, like political or military authority, while spiritual authority refers to religious guidance and leadership. So, the Guru in question must have been the one who combined both these aspects, indicating a shift towards a more active role in worldly affairs.\n\nNow, let's think about the sequence of the Sikh Gurus. I believe Guru Nanak was the first Guru, followed by Guru Angad, Guru Amar Das, Guru Ram Das, Guru Arjan, Guru Hargobind, Guru Har Rai, Guru Har Krishan, Guru Tegh Bahadur, and finally Guru Gobind Singh. So, out of the given options, Guru Nanak was the first, Guru Arjan was the fifth, Guru Hargobind was the sixth, and Guru Ram Das was the fourth.\n\nI recall that Guru Hargobind is known for introducing a more militant approach to protect the Sikh community. He is often credited with laying the foundation for the Sikh army and is said to have worn two swords, one for spiritual power and one for temporal power. This seems to align perfectly with the question.\n\nLet me double-check this information. I think Guru Hargobind was the first to emphasize the importance of both the spiritual and temporal domains for Sikhs. He is revered for his role in defending the Sikh community against persecution during his time.\n\nGuru Nanak, as the first Guru, was primarily focused on spiritual teachings and spreading the message of equality and devotion to God. Guru Arjan was known for compiling the Adi Granth, the holy scripture of Sikhism, and for his martyrdom under Mughal rule. Guru Ram Das founded the city of Amritsar and was involved in the construction of the Golden Temple.\n\nSo, based on this, Guru Hargobind seems to be the most fitting answer because he is specifically known for adopting the two swords, symbolizing both spiritual and temporal authority.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility that another Guru could also be associated with this symbol. For example, Guru Gobind Singh, who was the tenth Guru, also played a significant role in shaping the Sikh community and established the Khalsa, but he comes after Guru Hargobind in the lineage.\n\nSimilarly, Guru Tegh Bahadur, the ninth Guru, was a spiritual leader who also faced martyrdom for protecting the rights of others, but again, he comes after Guru Hargobind.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Guru Hargobind.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Guru Hargobind}} \\]"
