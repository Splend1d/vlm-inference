GCD stands for Greatest Common Divisor, which means I'm looking for the largest number that divides both 25 and 55 without leaving a remainder.\n\nFirst, I can list the factors of each number and then find the highest number that appears in both lists.\n\nLet's start with 25. The factors of 25 are:\n\n1, 5, 25\n\nNow, for 55, the factors are:\n\n1, 5, 11, 55\n\nLooking at both lists, the common factors are 1 and 5. So, the greatest common divisor should be 5.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to find the GCD. I've heard of the Euclidean algorithm, which involves dividing the larger number by the smaller number and then repeating the process with the remainder until the remainder is zero.\n\nSo, applying the Euclidean algorithm:\n\nDivide 55 by 25. 55 divided by 25 is 2, with a remainder of 55 - (2*25) = 55 - 50 = 5.\n\nNow, since the remainder is not zero, I swap the numbers and divide 25 by 5. 25 divided by 5 is 5, with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince the remainder is zero, the GCD is the last non-zero divisor, which is 5.\n\nThat matches my earlier result. So, the GCD is indeed 5.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to confirm this. Maybe using prime factors.\n\nThe prime factorization of 25 is 5 squared (5^2).\n\nThe prime factorization of 55 is 5 times 11.\n\nSo, the common prime factor is 5, and since it's the only common prime factor, the GCD is 5.\n\nAlright, all these methods point to 5 being the GCD.\n\nWait, but let's consider if there's any other factor higher than 5 that divides both 25 and 55. For example, does 25 divide both? Well, 25 divides 25 obviously, but 25 divided by 55 is not an integer, since 55 is less than 25. So, no.\n\nSimilarly, 11 divides 55, but not 25, so it's not a common divisor.\n\nSo, yes, 5 is the greatest common divisor.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
