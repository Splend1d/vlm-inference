                    "text": "So I have this problem here about calculating the Q-factor for an X-band EPR cavity. The resonator bandwidth is given as 1.58 MHz, and I need to find the Q-factor from the options provided: A. Q = 1012, B. Q = 2012, C. Q = 3012, D. Q = 6012.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Q-factor represents. The Q-factor, or quality factor, is a measure of the quality of a resonant circuit. It's defined as the ratio of the resonant frequency to the bandwidth. So, mathematically, Q = f\u2080 / \u0394f, where f\u2080 is the resonant frequency and \u0394f is the bandwidth.\n\nOkay, so I need to know the resonant frequency of the X-band EPR cavity. I remember that X-band typically operates in the frequency range of about 8 to 12 GHz. EPR, or Electron Paramagnetic Resonance, often uses frequencies around 9.5 GHz in the X-band. Let's assume f\u2080 is 9.5 GHz for this calculation.\n\nGiven that, f\u2080 = 9.5 GHz = 9,500 MHz.\n\nThe bandwidth \u0394f is given as 1.58 MHz.\n\nSo, Q = f\u2080 / \u0394f = 9,500 MHz / 1.58 MHz.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n9,500 divided by 1.58.\n\nFirst, 1.58 times 6,000 is 9,480, which is very close to 9,500.\n\n9,480 / 1.58 = 6,000.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's double-check that.\n\nActually, 1.58 * 6,000 = 9,480, and 1.58 * 6,012 = 9,500.004, which is almost exactly 9,500.\n\nSo, Q \u2248 6,012.\n\nLooking at the options, D. Q = 6012 is the closest match.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should be more precise.\n\nLet me calculate it again.\n\nf\u2080 = 9.5 GHz = 9,500 MHz\n\n\u0394f = 1.58 MHz\n\nQ = f\u2080 / \u0394f = 9,500 / 1.58 \u2248 6,012.658...\n\nSo, Q \u2248 6,012.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Q = 6012.\n\nBut let's make sure there isn't a mistake here.\n\nI know that in EPR, the resonant frequency can vary slightly depending on the specific setup, but 9.5 GHz is a common value for X-band EPR.\n\nAlso, the bandwidth is given directly as 1.58 MHz, so no issues there.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Q = 6012.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
