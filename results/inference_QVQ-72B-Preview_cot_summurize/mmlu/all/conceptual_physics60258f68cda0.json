                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about the speed of sound in air. It asks what the speed depends on, and the options are frequency, wavelength, air temperature, or all of these. Hmm, I need to recall some physics here.\n\nI remember that the speed of sound in a medium like air is related to the properties of the medium, not the properties of the sound wave itself, like frequency or wavelength. So, let me think about that.\n\nFirst, I know that the speed of sound in air is often given as around 343 meters per second at room temperature. But that's just a general figure. I think the exact speed does vary depending on certain factors.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Frequency.\n\nDoes the speed of sound depend on the frequency of the sound wave? I think not. I recall that for waves in general, the speed is independent of the frequency in a given medium. For example, both high-pitched and low-pitched sounds travel at the same speed in air, as long as the air conditions are the same. So, maybe frequency isn't a factor.\n\nB. Wavelength.\n\nWavelength is another property of the sound wave. If I remember correctly, wavelength is actually related to the frequency and the speed of sound by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{wavelength} = \\frac{\\text{speed of sound}}{\\text{frequency}} \\]\n\nSo, if speed depends on wavelength, that would imply it depends on frequency as well, which seems circular. I think wavelength doesn't directly affect the speed of sound in air.\n\nC. Air temperature.\n\nNow, this seems plausible. I've heard that the speed of sound increases with higher temperatures. Like, on a hotter day, sound travels faster. That makes sense because warmer air is less dense, and sound waves can propagate more quickly through less dense media.\n\nLet me try to recall the formula for the speed of sound in air. I think it's something like:\n\n\\[ v = 331.4 + 0.6T \\]\n\nWhere \\(v\\) is the speed of sound in meters per second, and \\(T\\) is the temperature in degrees Celsius. So, yes, there's a direct relationship between air temperature and the speed of sound.\n\nD. All of these.\n\nGiven that I think frequency and wavelength don't directly affect the speed of sound, but temperature does, I would lean towards not choosing this option.\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, the correct answer should be C. Air temperature.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about any other factors that might influence the speed of sound in air. For example, humidity can also affect the speed of sound. Higher humidity makes sound travel faster because water molecules are lighter than nitrogen and oxygen molecules. So, perhaps there's more to it than just temperature.\n\nHowever, the question specifies \"the speed of sound in air depends on,\" and gives the options as frequency, wavelength, air temperature, and all of these. Since humidity isn't listed, and I'm probably overcomplicating it, I'll stick with air temperature being the primary factor among the given options.\n\nAlright, I think the answer is C. Air temperature.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
