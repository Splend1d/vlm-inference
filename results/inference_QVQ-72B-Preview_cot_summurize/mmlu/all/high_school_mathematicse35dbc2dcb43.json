                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Bob's Burger Barn sign, which is a regular octagon. I need to find out how many degrees are in the measure of one of its interior angles. The options are 90, 135, 45, and 180 degrees. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that a regular octagon is an eight-sided shape with all sides and angles equal. So, all its interior angles should be the same. I need to find the measure of one of these interior angles.\n\nI remember there's a formula to find the sum of all interior angles in a polygon. It's something like (n-2) times 180 degrees, where n is the number of sides. So, for an octagon, n equals 8. Let's calculate that:\n\n(8 - 2) \u00d7 180\u00b0 = 6 \u00d7 180\u00b0 = 1080\u00b0\n\nSo, the total measure of all interior angles in a regular octagon is 1080 degrees.\n\nNow, since it's a regular octagon, all interior angles are equal. To find the measure of one interior angle, I just need to divide the total sum by the number of angles, which is 8.\n\n1080\u00b0 \u00f7 8 = 135\u00b0\n\nSo, each interior angle measures 135 degrees.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to find this? Maybe using exterior angles or something else? I think knowing different methods could help reinforce my understanding.\n\nLet me think about exterior angles. In a regular polygon, all exterior angles are equal and add up to 360 degrees. The measure of one exterior angle is 360\u00b0 divided by n, where n is the number of sides.\n\nFor an octagon, n is 8, so:\n\n360\u00b0 \u00f7 8 = 45\u00b0\n\nEach exterior angle is 45 degrees.\n\nNow, the relationship between interior and exterior angles is that they add up to 180 degrees because they are linear pairs.\n\nSo, interior angle + exterior angle = 180\u00b0\n\nTherefore, interior angle = 180\u00b0 - exterior angle\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nInterior angle = 180\u00b0 - 45\u00b0 = 135\u00b0\n\nAgain, I get the same answer of 135 degrees.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can draw a regular octagon and see if this makes sense visually. A regular octagon has sides of equal length and angles of equal measure. If I imagine dividing it into triangles, say by drawing diagonals from one vertex, I can find the sum of the interior angles.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the measure of each interior angle in a regular polygon, which is:\n\n[(n-2) \u00d7 180\u00b0] \u00f7 n\n\nAgain, for n = 8:\n\n[(8-2) \u00d7 180\u00b0] \u00f7 8 = (6 \u00d7 180\u00b0) \u00f7 8 = 1080\u00b0 \u00f7 8 = 135\u00b0\n\nConsistency across methods is reassuring. It looks like 135 degrees is the correct answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other approach or potential mistake here. One thing I should remember is that in a regular polygon, the central angles are also equal, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nAlso, I know that in real life, octagons are common in stop signs, but that's beside the point here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the properties of the polygon. For example, in a regular octagon, each interior angle is 135 degrees, which matches what I've calculated.\n\nI should also consider if the polygon is convex or concave, but since it's a regular octagon, it's convex, and the formula I used applies to convex regular polygons.\n\nJust to make sure, let's think about the sum of interior angles again. The formula (n-2) \u00d7 180\u00b0 comes from the fact that any n-sided polygon can be divided into (n-2) triangles, and each triangle has 180\u00b0.\n\nFor an octagon, 8 - 2 = 6 triangles, and 6 \u00d7 180\u00b0 = 1080\u00b0, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nI think I've covered a few different ways to approach this problem and each one leads me to the same conclusion: the measure of an interior angle in a regular octagon is 135 degrees.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 90\n\nB. 135\n\nC. 45\n\nD. 180\n\nSo, the correct choice is B. 135.\n\nI feel confident about this answer because I've used multiple methods to arrive at it, and they all confirm each other.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{135} \\]"
