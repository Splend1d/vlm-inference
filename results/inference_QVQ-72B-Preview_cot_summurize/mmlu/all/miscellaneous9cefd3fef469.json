I need to identify which one of these countries is not located in Europe.\n\nFirst, I know that Europe is one of the continents, and it's separated from Asia by the Ural Mountains and the Caspian Sea. But I think for the purpose of this question, I don't need to get into that much detail.\n\nLet me recall some basic geography about each country.\n\nStarting with Italy. Italy is famous for its history, culture, and food. It's shaped like a boot and is located in Southern Europe. It's part of the European Union and uses the euro as its currency. So, definitely, Italy is in Europe.\n\nNext is Spain. Spain is also in Southern Europe, bordering Portugal and France. It's known for its beautiful cities like Madrid and Barcelona, and it's famous for its beaches and historical sites. Spain is also part of the European Union. So, Spain is definitely in Europe too.\n\nThen there's Greece. Greece is located in Southeastern Europe, with a rich history and culture that goes back thousands of years. It's famous for its ancient philosophers, Olympian gods, and beautiful islands. Greece is also a member of the European Union. So, Greece is certainly in Europe.\n\nNow, finally, there's Israel. Israel is a bit of a different case. Geographically, it's located in the Middle East, which is part of Asia. It's bordered by countries like Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt. Israel is known for its significant religious sites, deserts, and modern cities like Tel Aviv.\n\nWait a minute, sometimes people might think that the Middle East is part of Europe, but that's not accurate. The Middle East is generally considered part of Asia, not Europe.\n\nSo, based on this, Israel is not in Europe; it's in Asia.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Sometimes, political affiliations can be confusing, but geographically speaking, Israel is in Asia.\n\nAlso, I remember that Israel is a member of the Asian Football Confederation, which further confirms its Asian location.\n\nMoreover, when looking at the map, Israel is located on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, which is part of the Asian continent.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty confident that Israel is not in Europe, whereas Italy, Spain, and Greece are all European countries.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Israel.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly recap:\n\n- Italy: in Europe\n\n- Spain: in Europe\n\n- Greece: in Europe\n\n- Israel: in Asia\n\nSo, the odd one out is Israel.\n\nI think that's straightforward enough.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Israel}} \\]"
