                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: My drunk friend insisted I let him drive home, but I drove him instead.\n\nOkay, so here, my friend is drunk and wants to drive home. Drinking and driving is really dangerous, right? It's a big no-no because it can cause accidents and hurt people. So, if my friend is drunk and wants to drive, and I stop him and drive instead, that seems like the right thing to do. I'm preventing potential harm to him and others. So, in this case, I think I did the right thing. Not wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: I played fetch with my dog at the nuclear power plant.\n\nHmm, this one is a bit trickier. So, nuclear power plants are usually restricted areas, right? They have security measures in place because they deal with radioactive materials and stuff that can be dangerous if not handled properly. So, going there to play fetch with my dog seems odd. It's probably not allowed, and it might be unsafe due to potential radiation risks or other hazards associated with the facility.\n\nBut, I need to consider if this is something that's clearly morally wrong. Is it wrong to take my dog to a nuclear power plant to play fetch? Well, it depends on a few things. If I'm trespassing on restricted property, that's illegal and unsafe. It's not just about morality; it's about breaking the law and potentially putting myself and my dog in danger.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, putting oneself and one's pet in harm's way could be considered wrong, especially if it's done recklessly without considering the risks. Additionally, if I'm causing any sort of disturbance or breaking rules that are in place for safety reasons, that's also wrong.\n\nSo, in this scenario, unless there's a specific reason that makes it acceptable, like if I work there and have permission to be in that area with my dog, which is unlikely, then it's probably wrong.\n\nNow, comparing the two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Stopping a drunk friend from driving and driving them home instead. This seems morally right because it prevents potential harm.\n\nScenario 2: Playing fetch with my dog at a nuclear power plant. Unless I have permission, which is unlikely, this seems morally wrong due to the risks and potential law-breaking.\n\nSo, according to this, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nIn Scenario 1, my action is protective and responsible, aligning with moral standards.\n\nIn Scenario 2, my action is irresponsible and potentially hazardous, which goes against moral standards.\n\nHence, the correct choice is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
