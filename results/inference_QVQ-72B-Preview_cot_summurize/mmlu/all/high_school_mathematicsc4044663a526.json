                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about bags of bird feed being delivered over several days. Let me see if I can figure out how many bags there will be by the end of the week.\n\nFirst, there are nine bags already in the storage room. That's like our starting point. Then, on Monday, seventeen more bags will be delivered. So, I need to add those together. Nine plus seventeen. Let's calculate that: 9 + 17 equals 26 bags.\n\nNext, on Tuesday, twenty-two bags will be delivered. So, I should add those to the total I have so far. 26 plus 22. Hmm, 26 plus 20 is 46, and then adding the extra 2 makes it 48 bags.\n\nWait, but the problem says twenty-two bags on Tuesday. Is there a typo? Because 22 is twenty-two, not twenty-three. Maybe I misread it, but I'll assume it's twenty-two as stated.\n\nThen, on Wednesday, three bags are delivered. So, adding those to the total: 48 plus 3 is 51 bags.\n\nAfter that, on Thursday, eleven bags are delivered. Adding those: 51 plus 11 equals 62 bags.\n\nFinally, on Friday, eighteen bags are delivered. So, adding those to the total: 62 plus 18. Let's see, 62 plus 18 is 80 bags.\n\nWait a minute, but looking back at the options, they are:\n\nA. 9\n\nB. 25\n\nC. 60\n\nD. 80\n\nSo, according to my calculations, the answer should be 80 bags. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with nine bags:\n\nMonday: +17 bags \u2192 total so far: 9 + 17 = 26\n\nTuesday: +22 bags \u2192 26 + 22 = 48\n\nWednesday: +3 bags \u2192 48 + 3 = 51\n\nThursday: +11 bags \u2192 51 + 11 = 62\n\nFriday: +18 bags \u2192 62 + 18 = 80\n\nYeah, that seems correct. I don't see any errors in the addition.\n\nAlternatively, I could add up all the deliveries and then add the initial nine bags.\n\nSo, deliveries are: Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday + Thursday + Friday = 17 + 22 + 3 + 11 + 18.\n\nLet's add those deliveries together:\n\n17 + 22 = 39\n\n39 + 3 = 42\n\n42 + 11 = 53\n\n53 + 18 = 71\n\nSo, total deliveries are 71 bags.\n\nNow, add that to the initial nine bags: 9 + 71 = 80 bags.\n\nSame result as before. So, it confirms that there are 80 bags in total by the end of the week.\n\nI think that's the answer. Unless there's some trick I'm missing, but based on the information given, it seems straightforward.\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. 80.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
