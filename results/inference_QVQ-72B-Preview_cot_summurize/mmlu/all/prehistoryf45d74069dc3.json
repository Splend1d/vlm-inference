Australopithecus robustus\n\nAlright, I need to figure out which one of these is the species that Lucy belongs to. I remember that Lucy is a famous fossil, right? But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.\n\nFirst off, I should probably recall who Lucy is. I think she's an ancient human ancestor, or maybe a predecessor of modern humans. Let me see... I think she was discovered in Ethiopia, and she's quite old\u2014like, millions of years old. But I'm not sure about the exact age.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Homo habilis: I know that Homo habilis is considered one of the early species in the genus Homo, which is the same genus as modern humans, Homo sapiens. They were known for making tools, hence the name \"handy man.\" But I think Lucy is older than Homo habilis.\n\nB. Australopithecus afarensis: This sounds familiar. Australopithecus is another genus of early hominins, which are older than the Homo genus. Afarensis refers to the Afar region in Ethiopia, where many fossils have been found. Maybe Lucy belongs to this species?\n\nC. Homo sapiens: That's us, modern humans. Lucy is definitely not a modern human; she's much older than that.\n\nD. Australopithecus robustus: Another species of Australopithecus, known for their robust skulls and jaws, suggesting they had a different diet compared to other hominins. I think they were contemporaries of early Homo species but were more specialized in their diet.\n\nOkay, so Homo sapiens is out of the question because Lucy is not a modern human. Now, between Homo habilis and Australopithecus afarensis, which one is older? I think Homo habilis lived from about 2.4 to 1.4 million years ago, whereas Australopithecus afarensis is older, maybe from about 3.9 to 2.9 million years ago. So, if Lucy is older than Homo habilis, she would belong to Australopithecus afarensis.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check that. Maybe I should look up the age of Lucy to be sure.\n\nLet me recall: Lucy is estimated to be around 3.2 million years old. Yes, that sounds right. So, if Homo habilis was around from 2.4 to 1.4 million years ago, and Australopithecus afarensis from about 3.9 to 2.9 million years ago, then Lucy, being 3.2 million years old, would fall into the Australopithecus afarensis timeframe.\n\nMoreover, I think Lucy was classified as Australopithecus afarensis based on her anatomical features. For example, she had a small braincase, ape-like skull, but also had features that suggest she could walk upright, which is a characteristic of hominins.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider Australopithecus robustus. They were indeed robust, with thick skull bones and large molars, adapted for processing tough plant materials. Their timeline was roughly from about 2.5 to 1.2 million years ago, which overlaps with Homo habilis and early Homo erectus. Since Lucy is older than that, she wouldn't fit into this species.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Lucy belongs to Australopithecus afarensis. That makes sense based on both her age and her anatomical characteristics.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that she could be Homo habilis? I think Homo habilis was around from about 2.4 to 1.4 million years ago, but Lucy is 3.2 million years old, which is older. Unless there's some overlap or uncertainty in the dating, but I don't think so. The dates seem pretty well-established.\n\nAdditionally, Homo habilis had more human-like features compared to Australopithecus afarensis, such as a larger brain and more refined tools. Lucy, on the other hand, had more ape-like features and less advanced tools, if she used any at all.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence, Lucy belongs to Australopithecus afarensis.\n\nJust to confirm, I can think about the famous \"Lucy\" specimen, officially known as AL 288-1, which was discovered in 1974 in Hadar, Ethiopia. The scientists who found her classified her as Australopithecus afarensis, and that classification has generally been accepted by the scientific community.\n\nThere might be some debates or revisions over the years, but for the purpose of this question, Australopithecus afarensis is the correct answer.\n\nSo, my final choice is B. Australopithecus afarensis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
