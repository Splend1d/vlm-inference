                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about capacitors and charges, and I need to figure out what charge is stored on each of three capacitors when they're connected in series to a battery. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that a 2 \u03bcF capacitor is connected directly to a battery and when it's fully charged, it stores 600 \u03bcC of charge. Okay, so I can use that information to find the voltage of the battery. I remember that the formula for the charge on a capacitor is Q = CV, where Q is the charge, C is the capacitance, and V is the voltage.\n\nSo, for the initial setup with the 2 \u03bcF capacitor:\n\nQ = 600 \u03bcC\n\nC = 2 \u03bcF\n\nTherefore, the voltage V = Q / C = 600 \u03bcC / 2 \u03bcF = 300 V.\n\nSo, the battery has a voltage of 300 volts.\n\nNow, the experimenter replaces the 2 \u03bcF capacitor with three 18 \u03bcF capacitors connected in series. I need to find out what charge is stored on each of these capacitors once they're fully charged.\n\nFirst, I should recall how capacitors behave when connected in series. In series connection, the total capacitance is less than any individual capacitance, and the formula for total capacitance (C_total) of n capacitors in series is:\n\n1 / C_total = 1 / C1 + 1 / C2 + ... + 1 / Cn\n\nIn this case, all three capacitors have the same capacitance of 18 \u03bcF each. So,\n\n1 / C_total = 1 / 18 \u03bcF + 1 / 18 \u03bcF + 1 / 18 \u03bcF = 3 / 18 \u03bcF = 1 / 6 \u03bcF\n\nTherefore, C_total = 6 \u03bcF.\n\nNow, when these capacitors are connected to the same battery of 300 V, the total charge stored on the equivalent capacitor would be Q_total = C_total * V = 6 \u03bcF * 300 V = 1800 \u03bcC.\n\nBut the question is asking for the charge stored on each capacitor. In a series connection, the charge on each capacitor is the same. So, each capacitor would store the same amount of charge.\n\nWait a minute, but let's verify that. In a series circuit, the current is the same through each component. When charging capacitors in series, the charge that flows through each capacitor should be the same, right? Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, if the total charge is 1800 \u03bcC and each capacitor stores the same charge, then each capacitor should have 1800 \u03bcC of charge.\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nA. 100 \u03bcC\n\nB. 200 \u03bcC\n\nC. 600 \u03bcC\n\nD. 1800 \u03bcC\n\nIt seems like 1800 \u03bcC is one of the options, but I need to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the voltages across each capacitor in series. In series connections, the voltage drops across each capacitor add up to the total voltage.\n\nThe formula for the voltage across each capacitor in series is:\n\nV_i = (C_total / C_i) * V\n\nBut in this case, since all capacitors are identical (each 18 \u03bcF), the voltage across each should be the same.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in series connections, the voltage across each capacitor is inversely proportional to its capacitance.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The formula for voltage division in series capacitors is V_i = (C_total / C_i) * V, but let me double-check that.\n\nActually, the correct formula is V_i = (C_total / C_i) * V, but that seems counterintuitive because it would suggest that a smaller capacitance has a higher voltage, which makes sense because it can store less charge at higher voltage.\n\nBut in this problem, all capacitors are identical, each 18 \u03bcF, so the voltage across each should be equal.\n\nTotal voltage V = 300 V\n\nNumber of capacitors in series = 3\n\nTherefore, voltage across each capacitor V_i = V / 3 = 100 V\n\nNow, since each capacitor has the same charge Q_i, and Q_i = C_i * V_i\n\nGiven that C_i = 18 \u03bcF and V_i = 100 V,\n\nQ_i = 18 \u03bcF * 100 V = 1800 \u03bcC\n\nSo, each capacitor stores 1800 \u03bcC of charge.\n\nBut looking back at the options, 1800 \u03bcC is one of them, so the answer should be D. 1800 \u03bcC.\n\nBut let me make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nIs there any possibility that the charge is different on each capacitor? No, in series connection, the charge on each capacitor is the same, as the charge flows through each one sequentially.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the initial step where I found the battery voltage.\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\nInitial setup:\n\n2 \u03bcF capacitor stores 600 \u03bcC charge.\n\nQ = CV => V = Q / C = 600 \u03bcC / 2 \u03bcF = 300 V. That seems correct.\n\nThen, three 18 \u03bcF capacitors in series have equivalent capacitance of 6 \u03bcF, as calculated.\n\nTotal charge Q_total = C_total * V = 6 \u03bcF * 300 V = 1800 \u03bcC.\n\nSince in series, each capacitor has the same charge, each has 1800 \u03bcC.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 1800 \u03bcC.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 1800\\ \\mu\\text{C}} \\]"
