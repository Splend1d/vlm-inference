Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that the American flag has stars and stripes. The stripes are usually 13, representing the original 13 colonies. But the question is about the stars. I think the stars also represent the states, right? So, since there are more than 13 states now, it can't be option A.\n\nLet me think about the current number of states. I know that the United States has 50 states. So, option C is 50, which seems plausible. But then, why would there be 50 stars on the flag? Because each star represents a state, that makes sense.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that there was a time when the flag had fewer stars, like 48, which is option B. Was there ever a flag with 48 stars? Let me recall: I think the 48-star flag was used from 1912 to 1959, before Alaska and Hawaii became states in 1959 and 1960, respectively. So, historically, there was a flag with 48 stars, but that's not the current one.\n\nOption D is 51. Is there a flag with 51 stars? I don't think so. Sometimes people talk about Washington, D.C. becoming a state, which would make it the 51st state, but that hasn't happened yet. So, as of now, there aren't 51 states.\n\nSo, between options B and C, C is the correct answer because there are currently 50 states, and the flag has 50 stars.\n\nBut just to make sure, I'll double-check. I remember that the flag was last updated in 1960 when Hawaii became the 50th state, and they added the 50th star. So, yes, the flag has 50 stars arranged in a field of blue.\n\nI don't think it's 13 because that's only the original colonies. And 51 isn't correct yet, unless there's been a recent change that I'm not aware of, which I don't think is the case.\n\nAlso, considering that the flag is supposed to represent all the states, having 50 stars makes sense for the 50 states.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. 50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
