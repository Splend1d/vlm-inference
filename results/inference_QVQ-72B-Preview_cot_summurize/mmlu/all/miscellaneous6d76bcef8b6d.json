                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"What quantity of oxygen, O\u2082, contains very nearly the same number of molecules as 36.0 grams of water, H\u2082O?\" And there are four options to choose from: A. 64.0 grams, B. 32.0 grams, C. 16.0 grams, D. 8.0 grams.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to find out how many molecules are in 36.0 grams of water and then find out how much oxygen, in grams, would have the same number of molecules.\n\nI remember that the number of molecules in a substance can be found using Avogadro's number, which is approximately 6.022 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u00b3 molecules per mole. So, if I can find out how many moles are in 36.0 grams of water, I can then find out how many molecules that corresponds to, and then work backwards to find out how many grams of oxygen would have the same number of molecules.\n\nOkay, so step one is to find the number of moles in 36.0 grams of water.\n\nThe molar mass of water (H\u2082O) is approximately 18.02 grams per mole. To find the number of moles, I divide the mass by the molar mass.\n\nSo, moles of water = mass / molar mass = 36.0 g / 18.02 g/mol \u2248 1.998 moles.\n\nNow, the number of molecules in 1.998 moles of water is 1.998 moles \u00d7 6.022 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u00b3 molecules/mol \u2248 1.20 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u2074 molecules.\n\nSo, 36.0 grams of water contains approximately 1.20 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u2074 molecules.\n\nNow, I need to find how much oxygen (O\u2082) would have the same number of molecules, which is 1.20 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u2074 molecules.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many moles of oxygen that would be.\n\nSince one mole contains 6.022 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u00b3 molecules, then:\n\nmoles of O\u2082 = (1.20 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u2074 molecules) / (6.022 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u00b3 molecules/mol) \u2248 1.99 moles.\n\nNow, the molar mass of oxygen (O\u2082) is approximately 32.00 grams per mole.\n\nTherefore, mass of O\u2082 = moles \u00d7 molar mass = 1.99 moles \u00d7 32.00 g/mol \u2248 63.68 grams.\n\nSo, approximately 63.68 grams of oxygen would contain the same number of molecules as 36.0 grams of water.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 64.0 grams\n\nB. 32.0 grams\n\nC. 16.0 grams\n\nD. 8.0 grams\n\nMy calculation gives me approximately 63.68 grams, which is closest to option A. 64.0 grams.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, molar mass of water is indeed around 18.02 g/mol.\n\n36.0 g / 18.02 g/mol = approximately 1.997 moles.\n\n1.997 moles \u00d7 6.022 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u00b3 molecules/mol = approximately 1.20 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u2074 molecules.\n\nThen, for O\u2082, molar mass is 32.00 g/mol.\n\n1.20 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u2074 molecules / (6.022 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u00b3 molecules/mol) = approximately 1.99 moles.\n\n1.99 moles \u00d7 32.00 g/mol = 63.68 grams.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of equivalent masses or perhaps see if there's a simpler way to approach this.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula:\n\nmass of O\u2082 = (mass of H\u2082O \u00d7 molar mass of O\u2082) / molar mass of H\u2082O\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nmass of O\u2082 = (36.0 g \u00d7 32.0 g/mol) / 18.0 g/mol = (1152 g\u00b2/mol) / 18.0 g/mol = 64.0 grams.\n\nYes, that matches option A. 64.0 grams.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 64.0 grams.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 64.0\\ \\text{grams}} \\]"
