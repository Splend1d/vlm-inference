                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about the Qur'an and what it permits. The options are honor killing, stoning, adultery, and polygyny. I need to figure out which one of these is allowed according to the Qur'an.\n\nFirst off, I should probably understand what each term means to make sure I'm not mixing them up.\n\nHonor killing is when a person is killed by family members because they believe the person has brought dishonor on the family. That sounds extremely severe and it's often associated with certain cultural practices, but I don't recall the Qur'an condoning killing anyone based on honor. In fact, the Qur'an emphasizes the value of human life and only permits taking a life in very specific circumstances, like in cases of self-defense or as a punishment for crimes like murder.\n\nStoning is a form of capital punishment where a group of people throw stones at a person until they die. I think this is sometimes associated with certain interpretations of Islamic law, particularly in some conservative Muslim societies. However, I don't remember stoning being explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an as a prescribed punishment. I think the Qur'an outlines punishments for crimes like adultery, but it's not clear if stoning is directly sanctioned by the Qur'an itself or if it's more of a tradition that developed later through hadiths or local customs.\n\nAdultery is sexual intercourse between someone who is married and someone who is not their spouse. The Qur'an does address adultery and prescribes punishments for it. I believe it's mentioned in several verses, and there are specific penalties outlined, such as flogging. But again, stoning isn't directly mentioned in the Qur'an as the punishment for adultery, even though some interpretations of Islamic law might include stoning as a possible punishment under certain conditions.\n\nPolygyny is the practice of having multiple wives at the same time, typically one husband having several wives. This is different from polyandry, which is one wife having multiple husbands. In Islam, polygyny is permitted under certain conditions, with the maximum number of wives being four, provided the man can treat them all equally in terms of support and attention.\n\nWait a minute, is polygyny allowed in the Qur'an? Let me double-check that. I recall that the Qur'an does mention the possibility of having up to four wives, but with the condition of treating them equally. There are verses in the Qur'an that discuss marriage and the responsibilities of husbands and wives. One of the reasons given for allowing polygyny is to provide for widows and orphans who might need support.\n\nBut, it's also important to note that the Qur'an encourages monogamy and only allows polygyny under specific circumstances, emphasizing fairness and equity in treatment. So, while it's permitted, it's not encouraged as the norm.\n\nNow, going back to the question: Which of the following does the Qur'an permit?\n\nA. Honor Killing\n\nB. Stoning\n\nC. Adultery\n\nD. Polygyny\n\nFrom my understanding:\n\n- Honor killing is not permitted; in fact, it's against the principles of the Qur'an, which values human life.\n\n- Stoning isn't directly mentioned in the Qur'an as a prescribed punishment; it might be part of some interpretations of Islamic law but isn't explicitly allowed in the Qur'an.\n\n- Adultery is addressed in the Qur'an, and it's prohibited with specific punishments outlined, but again, stoning isn't directly mentioned.\n\n- Polygyny is permitted under certain conditions, with limitations on the number of wives and requirements for fair treatment.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that polygyny is the option that the Qur'an explicitly permits.\n\nBut, I should make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe I should look up some specific verses to confirm.\n\nLet me recall some verses related to these topics.\n\nStarting with honor killing:\n\nThe Qur'an says in Surah Al-Isra, verse 33: \"Do not cause harm, and do not be harmed.\" This suggests that causing harm to others is prohibited.\n\nIn Surah Al-Baqarah, verse 2:194: \"But if they fight you, then kill them. Such is the punishment of those who disbelieve.\" However, this is in the context of self-defense or during warfare, not for honor killings.\n\nSo, there's no support for honor killings in the Qur'an; in fact, it goes against the principles of preserving life.\n\nNext, stoning:\n\nI think there's a hadith that mentions stoning as a punishment for adultery, but I don't recall any direct verse in the Qur'an that prescribes stoning for adultery.\n\nLet me check Surah Al-Nur, which addresses adultery:\n\nSurah Al-Nur, verse 2: \"The women who commit fornication/adultery, and the men, flog each one of them with a hundred strokes. Let not compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by Allah, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a party of the believers witness their punishment.\"\n\nSo, the prescribed punishment is flogging, not stoning. Therefore, stoning isn't supported by the Qur'an for adultery.\n\nAdultery itself is prohibited, as per this verse, and there's a clear punishment outlined, which is flogging, not stoning.\n\nNow, polygyny:\n\nSurah An-Nisa, verse 4:3: \"If you fear that you will not be able to deal justly with the orphans, then marry from among those whom you desire of the women - two or three or four; but if you fear that you will not be just, then only one or what your right hands possess. That is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice].\"\n\nThis verse allows a man to have up to four wives, provided he can treat them all equally. It also mentions that if he cannot be just, he should stick to one wife.\n\nSo, polygyny is permitted under certain conditions, with an emphasis on fairness and equity.\n\nTherefore, among the given options, polygyny is the one that the Qur'an explicitly permits.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other options could be considered permitted in any way.\n\nHonor killing: Definitely not permitted; it's against the principles of preserving life and justice in the Qur'an.\n\nStoning: Not directly mentioned in the Qur'an as a prescribed punishment; hence, it's not permitted by the Qur'an.\n\nAdultery: It's prohibited, and there's a clear punishment for it, which is flogging, not stoning.\n\nPolygyny: Permitted under specific conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Polygyny.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
