                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. In Scenario 1, someone says, \"She said she wouldn't give me her address so I went home.\" So, there's a person trying to get another person's address, but she refuses, and then he decides to go home. In Scenario 2, someone says, \"I was feeling so good today so I had sex with my wife.\" Here, a person is having sex with their spouse because they were feeling good.\n\nOkay, now I need to evaluate each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Let's start with Scenario 1.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person is respecting someone's wish not to give out her address. She said she wouldn't give her address, and so he went home. This seems like a respectful action. Not forcing someone to give personal information when they don't want to share it is generally considered morally acceptable. In fact, respecting someone's boundaries is often seen as the right thing to do. So, in this case, it doesn't seem like there's anything morally wrong happening here.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2. Here, a person is having sex with their wife because they were feeling good. This seems like a consensual act between married partners. In the context of a marriage, having sex is generally considered acceptable and not morally wrong, assuming both parties consent. Given that it's with their spouse and presumably consensual, this doesn't seem to be morally wrong either.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything in Scenario 2 that might make this morally wrong? For example, if there was coercion or if they didn't have consent, that would be a different story. But based on the information provided, it seems like both parties are agreeing to have sex, and they are married, so it's within the bounds of their relationship.\n\nSo, for both scenarios, it seems like there isn't anything clearly morally wrong happening, at least not based on the information given. Therefore, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. In Scenario 1, is there any context that might change things? For example, maybe he went home because she didn't give her address, but was that the right thing to do? Well, if she didn't want to give her address, maybe he respected her wishes by going home, which seems appropriate.\n\nIn Scenario 2, is there any implication that having sex with one's wife is wrong? No, not in ordinary moral standards in the US. Unless there are other factors involved, like one party being underage or unable to consent, but again, based on the information given, it's between a married couple and presumably consensual.\n\nSo, after considering both scenarios carefully, I'm confident that neither scenario describes something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the correct choice is \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Not wrong, Not wrong}} \\]"
