                    "text": "Let's see how Eratosthenes estimated the size of Earth back in 240 B.C. That's really ancient times, and it's amazing that people were already figuring out things like this. So, the options are:\n\nA. By observing the duration of a solar eclipse.\n\nB. By measuring the size of Earth's shadow on the Moon in a lunar eclipse.\n\nC. By comparing the maximum altitude of the Sun in two cities at different latitudes at the same time on the same day.\n\nD. By sending fleets of ships around Earth.\n\nHmm, let's think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Observing the duration of a solar eclipse. I know that a solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, casting a shadow on Earth. The duration of the eclipse depends on how long the shadow passes over a particular location. But I'm not sure how that would help in measuring the size of Earth. Maybe if you could observe the eclipse from different places and time how long it lasted, you could get some idea of the Earth's circumference. But I think that's too indirect, and it might not be the method Eratosthenes used.\n\nOption B: Measuring the size of Earth's shadow on the Moon in a lunar eclipse. A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth blocks sunlight from reaching the Moon, casting a shadow on it. The size and shape of that shadow could theoretically give you information about the size of Earth. However, this seems even more indirect than the solar eclipse method. Plus, I don't recall any historical accounts of Eratosthenes using lunar eclipses for this purpose.\n\nOption C: Comparing the maximum altitude of the Sun in two cities at different latitudes at the same time on the same day. This sounds more familiar. I've heard that Eratosthenes compared the angle of the Sun's rays at noon on the summer solstice in two different cities in Egypt: Alexandria and Syene (which is now Aswan). He noticed that in Syene, the Sun was directly overhead at that time, while in Alexandria, it was slightly tilted. By measuring the angle difference and knowing the distance between the two cities, he could calculate the circumference of Earth. This seems like a straightforward method based on geometry and observation, which fits with what I know about Eratosthenes's approach.\n\nOption D: Sending fleets of ships around Earth. This is more of a direct measurement, where you could measure the distance traveled by a ship circumnavigating the globe. However, this method would be quite time-consuming and impractical in 240 B.C., considering the state of navigation and shipbuilding at that time. Plus, it's not something Eratosthenes, who was a scholar in Alexandria, would have undertaken.\n\nSo, based on my knowledge, Option C seems the most plausible method used by Eratosthenes to estimate the size of Earth. He compared the angles of the Sun's rays in two different locations to calculate the circumference of the Earth. It's a brilliant application of simple geometry and astronomical observations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
