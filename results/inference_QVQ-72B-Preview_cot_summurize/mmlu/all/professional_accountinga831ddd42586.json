                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, Jackson, a merchant, sent a signed letter to Sands on day 1, offering to sell 500 electric fans at $10 each. The letter was received by Sands on day 3, and it included a promise not to revoke the offer but didn't specify an expiration date. Then, on day 4, Jackson sent a revocation of the offer, which Sands received on day 6. Sands mailed an acceptance of the offer on day 7, which Jackson received on day 9. The question is, under the Sales Article of the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code), was a contract formed?\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basics about contract formation in the context of the UCC, especially since both parties are merchants. The UCC has specific rules regarding offers, acceptances, and revocations, particularly in the sale of goods.\n\nLet me start by understanding the sequence of events:\n\n1. **Offer:** Jackson mails an offer on day 1, received by Sands on day 3. This offer includes a promise not to revoke it but no expiration date.\n\n2. **Revocation:** Jackson mails a revocation on day 4, received by Sands on day 6.\n\n3. **Acceptance:** Sands mails an acceptance on day 7, received by Jackson on day 9.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the offer was still valid when Sands accepted it on day 7.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Offer**\n\n- The offer was made by Jackson, a merchant, to Sands.\n\n- It included a promise not to revoke the offer, but no specific expiration date was provided.\n\n- Under the UCC, particularly UCC 2-205, if a merchant makes an offer and promises not to revoke it, and no time is specified for acceptance, the offer is irrevocable for a reasonable time, but not to exceed three months.\n\n- So, in this case, since no time was specified, the offer is irrevocable for a reasonable time, let's say.\n\n**Step 2: Revocation of the Offer**\n\n- Jackson attempted to revoke the offer on day 4, which was received by Sands on day 6.\n\n- But, since the offer included a promise not to revoke it, can Jackson revoke it before the reasonable time has passed?\n\n- UCC 2-205 states that a firm offer (one by a merchant promising not to revoke) is irrevocable without consideration for a stated period or, if no period is stated, for a reasonable time, but not exceeding three months.\n\n- However, UCC 2-206 addresses revocation of offers. It says that until acceptance is dispatched:\n\n- An offer may be revoked at any time before acceptance is communicated.\n\n- But, if revocation is attempted, it must be received by the offeree before the offeree sends an acceptance.\n\n**Step 3: Timing of Events**\n\n- Offer received by Sands on day 3.\n\n- Revocation sent on day 4 and received on day 6.\n\n- Acceptance sent on day 7 and received on day 9.\n\n- So, Sands received the revocation on day 6 and then sent an acceptance on day 7.\n\n- Did Sands have knowledge of the revocation when they sent the acceptance?\n\n- If Sands knew about the revocation before sending the acceptance, does that affect the validity of the acceptance?\n\n**Step 4: Analysis**\n\n- According to UCC 2-206, an offer can be revoked any time before acceptance is dispatched, provided the revocation is received before the acceptance is dispatched.\n\n- In this case, the revocation was received by Sands on day 6, and the acceptance was dispatched on day 7.\n\n- So, Sands dispatched the acceptance after receiving the revocation.\n\n- Does this mean that the acceptance is invalid because Sands had knowledge of the revocation?\n\n- Or does the fact that the revocation was received after the offer's irrevocability period (if any) matters?\n\nWait a minute, the offer was irrevocable for a reasonable time or up to three months under UCC 2-205, but Jackson tried to revoke it before that period ended.\n\nBut, according to UCC 2-206, even if the offer is irrevocable, it can still be revoked if the revocation is received before the acceptance is dispatched.\n\nSo, in this scenario:\n\n- Offer received on day 3.\n\n- Revocation sent on day 4 and received on day 6.\n\n- Acceptance sent on day 7.\n\nSince the revocation was received before the acceptance was dispatched, the offer was effectively revoked on day 6, and Sands was aware of this revocation when they sent the acceptance on day 7.\n\nTherefore, the acceptance was\u65e0\u6548 because the offer was no longer valid.\n\nHence, no contract was formed.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check.\n\nAnother point to consider is that the offer included a promise not to revoke, but Jackson did revoke it. Does that promise bind Jackson to keep the offer open for a reasonable time without revoking it?\n\nUnder UCC 2-205, a firm offer by a merchant is irrevocable without consideration for a stated period or, if no period is stated, for a reasonable time, but not exceeding three months.\n\nIn this case, no period was stated, so it's irrevocable for a reasonable time, up to three months.\n\nBut Jackson revoked the offer on day 4, which is well within the three months.\n\nIs there a \"reasonable time\" that has passed yet?\n\nProbably not, since only a few days have passed.\n\nHowever, according to UCC 2-206, even if the offer is irrevocable, it can still be revoked if the revocation is received before the acceptance is dispatched.\n\nSo, even if the offer is irrevocable for a reasonable time, the offeror can still revoke it, provided the revocation is received before the acceptance is dispatched.\n\nIn this scenario, the revocation was received on day 6, and the acceptance was dispatched on day 7.\n\nTherefore, the revocation was effective, and the acceptance was\u65e0\u6548 because it was sent after the offer was revoked.\n\nThus, no contract was formed.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. No contract was formed because the offer failed to state an expiration date.\n\n- This is incorrect because the absence of an expiration date makes the offer irrevocable for a reasonable time, not invalid.\n\nB. No contract was formed because Sands received the revocation of the offer before Sands accepted the offer.\n\n- This seems accurate based on the analysis above.\n\nC. A contract was formed on the day Jackson received Sands' acceptance.\n\n- This would be incorrect because the offer was revoked before the acceptance was dispatched.\n\nD. A contract was formed on the day Sands mailed the acceptance to Jackson.\n\n- Also incorrect for the same reason.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. No contract was formed because Sands received the revocation of the offer before Sands accepted the offer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
