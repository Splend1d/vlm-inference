The options are:\n\nA. two \u03b1 (alpha) and two \u03b2 (beta) chains.\n\nB. two \u03b1 and two \u03b3 (gamma) chains.\n\nC. two \u03b1 and two \u03b4 (delta) chains.\n\nD. four \u03b3 chains.\n\nHmm, I remember that hemoglobin is made up of different types of globin chains, and the type depends on the stage of life, like fetal or adult. So, for normal adult hemoglobin, which is Hb A, what's its structure again?\n\nLet me think back to my biology classes. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. It's a tetramer, meaning it consists of four subunits. These subunits are globin chains, and there are different types of these chains, like alpha, beta, gamma, and delta.\n\nIn adult hemoglobin, which is Hb A, the typical composition is two alpha chains and two beta chains. So, that would be option A: two \u03b1 and two \u03b2 chains.\n\nBut let me double-check because I recall there's also something called Hb A2, which has delta chains instead of beta chains. So, Hb A2 would be two alpha and two delta chains, which is option C. But that's not the main adult hemoglobin; it's a minor component.\n\nOption B suggests two alpha and two gamma chains. That sounds familiar because gamma chains are present in fetal hemoglobin, which is Hb F. So, in fetal life, hemoglobin is mostly Hb F, which has two alpha and two gamma chains. But again, that's not the normal adult hemoglobin.\n\nOption D says four gamma chains. That doesn't ring a bell. I don't think there's a type of hemoglobin that consists of four gamma chains. Maybe that's a distractor.\n\nSo, based on what I know, the correct answer should be option A: two \u03b1 and two \u03b2 chains.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there are any exceptions or special cases where adult hemoglobin has a different composition. No, I don't think so. In healthy adults, Hb A is predominantly two alpha and two beta chains.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll recall the names of the different hemoglobin types:\n\n- Hb A: adult hemoglobin, \u03b12\u03b22\n\n- Hb A2: another form in adults, but less common, \u03b12\u03b42\n\n- Hb F: fetal hemoglobin, \u03b12\u03b32\n\n- And then there are various abnormal hemoglobins seen in conditions like sickle cell anemia or thalassemias, but those are not the normal adult forms.\n\nSo, yes, the standard normal adult hemoglobin is Hb A, which consists of two alpha and two beta chains.\n\nI think I'm confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
