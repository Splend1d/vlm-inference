                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this case about negligent entrustment. It involves a teenager who borrowed a car from his uncle, even though the uncle knew the teen wasn't a safe driver. The teen had a really bad driving record, including multiple license suspensions, negligence lawsuits, DUIs, and he was known to be an alcoholic. Unfortunately, the teen got into an accident with the car and was injured. Now, he's suing his uncle for negligent entrustment, saying the uncle shouldn't have let him drive the car in the first place.\n\nThe uncle is trying to get the case dismissed, arguing that there's no such thing as a first-party negligent entrustment claim\u2014that is, where the person who was entrusted with something is the one seeking damages. The trial court agreed with the uncle and dismissed the case. Now, the teen is appealing, and I need to figure out whether the appellate court is likely to uphold that decision.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what negligent entrustment is. Generally, negligent entrustment occurs when someone lends or allows another person to use property or equipment, knowing or having reason to know that the person isn't competent or safe to use it. So, in this case, the uncle knew the teen was a bad driver and shouldn't have been driving, but he let him anyway.\n\nUsually, negligent entrustment claims are brought by third parties who were injured by the negligent entrustee. For example, if the teen had hit another car and injured someone else, that person could sue the uncle for negligent entrustment. But in this case, it's the teen himself who's injured and suing.\n\nThe issue here is whether the teen can sue for first-party negligent entrustment. The uncle is arguing that this isn't a valid claim, and the trial court agreed. Now, the appellate court has to decide whether to affirm that decision.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because public policy generally forbids the collection of damages by the person to whom the entrustment is made.\n\nB. Yes, because the comparative negligence of the entrustee will always defeat liability against the entrustor.\n\nC. No, because public policy demands that the entrustor is strictly liable to all who are injured, including the incompetent entrustee.\n\nD. No, because a first-party negligent entrustment claim is generally allowed when the entrustor knows that he is loaning the vehicle to an incompetent operator.\n\nI need to think about which one makes the most sense.\n\nStarting with option A: It says that public policy generally forbids the collection of damages by the person to whom the entrustment is made. So, the idea is that the law doesn't want to allow someone who was entrusted with something to turn around and sue the person who entrusted them if they get hurt. Maybe there's a thought that such a person is responsible for their own actions and shouldn't be able to shift blame entirely to the entrustor.\n\nOption B says that the comparative negligence of the entrustee will always defeat liability against the entrustor. Comparative negligence is a doctrine where the damages awarded to an injured party are reduced by the percentage of fault that party had in causing the injury. So, if the teen was negligent in driving and caused the accident, his recovery from the uncle could be reduced based on his own fault. But the option says \"always defeat liability,\" which seems strong. Maybe in some jurisdictions, if the entrustee is found to be more at fault than the entrustor, they can't recover anything. But I don't think it's always the case.\n\nOption C says no, because public policy demands that the entrustor is strictly liable to all who are injured, including the incompetent entrustee. Strict liability means liability without the need to prove negligence or fault. So, if the uncle is strictly liable, he's responsible for any injuries caused by the teen driving the car, regardless of who was at fault. But in this case, it's not clear if strict liability applies, and especially if it would apply to the entrustee himself.\n\nOption D says no, because a first-party negligent entrustment claim is generally allowed when the entrustor knows that he is loaning the vehicle to an incompetent operator. This seems to suggest that in some jurisdictions, it is possible for the entrustee to sue for negligent entrustment if the entrustor knew of the incompetence.\n\nI need to think about this more carefully.\n\nFirst, in most negligent entrustment cases, the claim is brought by a third party who was injured by the negligent actions of the person to whom something was entrusted. The idea is that the entrustor should have known that the person wasn't competent to use the property safely, and therefore should be liable for any harm caused to others.\n\nBut in this case, it's the entrustee himself who's injured and suing. So, it's a first-party claim.\n\nI need to see if such claims are recognized in law.\n\nOne argument against allowing first-party negligent entrustment claims is that it could be seen as allowing the entrustee to benefit from their own wrongdoing. If the entrustee is incompetent and causes an accident, they're already at fault, so allowing them to sue the entrustor might be seen as letting them shift blame.\n\nHowever, another perspective is that the entrustor also bears responsibility for allowing an incompetent person to use the property, and should be liable for any foreseeable harm that results, including injuries to the entrustee.\n\nLooking at case law, I recall that in some jurisdictions, first-party negligent entrustment claims have been recognized, while in others, they haven't.\n\nFor example, in some states, courts have allowed such claims, reasoning that the entrustor's conduct in entrusting the property to an incompetent person is a separate tort that can be the basis for the entrustee's claim.\n\nOn the other hand, other courts have dismissed first-party claims on the grounds that public policy doesn't support allowing someone to recover for injuries caused by their own negligence or incompetence.\n\nIn this particular case, the trial court granted the motion to dismiss, suggesting that in this jurisdiction, first-party negligent entrustment isn't recognized.\n\nNow, on appeal, the question is whether the appellate court will uphold that decision.\n\nConsidering the options again:\n\nA. Yes, because public policy generally forbids the collection of damages by the person to whom the entrustment is made.\n\nB. Yes, because the comparative negligence of the entrustee will always defeat liability against the entrustor.\n\nC. No, because public policy demands that the entrustor is strictly liable to all who are injured, including the incompetent entrustee.\n\nD. No, because a first-party negligent entrustment claim is generally allowed when the entrustor knows that he is loaning the vehicle to an incompetent operator.\n\nI think option A is a possible reason for affirming the lower court's decision. If public policy in this jurisdiction generally forbids such claims, then the appellate court might agree with the trial court's dismissal.\n\nOption B suggests that comparative negligence always defeats liability, but that might not be the case in all situations. Comparative negligence typically reduces the amount of damages recoverable, not necessarily barring recovery entirely unless the entrustee is more at fault than the entrustor.\n\nOption C mentions strict liability, which isn't typically how negligent entrustment is framed. Negligent entrustment is based on negligence, not strict liability. So, this seems like a misapplication of the concept.\n\nOption D suggests that first-party negligent entrustment claims are generally allowed when the entrustor knows of the incompetence. However, as I've learned, this isn't universally accepted across all jurisdictions.\n\nGiven that, I need to consider the specific law in this jurisdiction. Since I don't have that information, I need to make an educated guess based on general principles.\n\nI think the most plausible answer is A: Yes, because public policy generally forbids the collection of damages by the person to whom the entrustment is made.\n\nThis is because allowing an entrustee to sue for their own injuries caused by their own incompetence might be seen as contrary to public policy, which generally disfavors rewarding someone for their own negligent or reckless behavior.\n\nMoreover, in many legal systems, there's a principle that a person cannot benefit from their own wrongdoings. Allowing a first-party negligent entrustment claim could be seen as enabling just that.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that the appellate court will affirm the lower court's decision, agreeing that such claims are not permitted under public policy.\n\nSo, my answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
