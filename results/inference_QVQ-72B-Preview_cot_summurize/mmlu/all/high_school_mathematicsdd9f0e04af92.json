                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 4 red and 6 blue marbles in a bag, making a total of 10 marbles. I need to find the probability that both marbles selected without replacement are the same color. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I need to find the probability that both marbles drawn are either both red or both blue. So, I can think of this as the probability of both marbles being red plus the probability of both marbles being blue, since these are mutually exclusive events.\n\nLet me start by calculating the probability of both marbles being red. There are 4 red marbles out of 10 initially. Since the first marble isn't replaced, the total number of marbles decreases by one for the second draw, and the number of red marbles decreases by one if a red marble is drawn first.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a red marble first is 4/10. Then, given that the first marble is red, the probability of drawing another red marble is 3/9, since there are now 3 red marbles left out of 9 total marbles. So, the probability of both marbles being red is (4/10) * (3/9).\n\nLet me calculate that: (4/10) * (3/9) = (2/5) * (1/3) = 2/15.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the probability of both marbles being blue. There are 6 blue marbles out of 10 initially. If I draw one blue marble first, the probability is 6/10. Then, without replacement, there are 5 blue marbles left out of 9 total marbles. So, the probability of drawing another blue marble is 5/9. Therefore, the probability of both marbles being blue is (6/10) * (5/9).\n\nCalculating that: (6/10) * (5/9) = (3/5) * (5/9) = 3/9 = 1/3.\n\nNow, to find the total probability that both marbles are the same color, I add the probabilities of both events:\n\n2/15 + 1/3 = 2/15 + 5/15 = 7/15.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 7/15 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, probability both red: (4/10)*(3/9) = 12/90 = 2/15. That seems correct.\n\nThen, probability both blue: (6/10)*(5/9) = 30/90 = 1/3. That also seems correct.\n\nAdding them up: 2/15 + 1/3 = 2/15 + 5/15 = 7/15. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to think of it using combinations. The number of ways to choose 2 red marbles out of 4 is C(4,2), and the total number of ways to choose 2 marbles out of 10 is C(10,2). Similarly, the number of ways to choose 2 blue marbles out of 6 is C(6,2).\n\nSo, C(4,2)/C(10,2) + C(6,2)/C(10,2).\n\nCalculating C(4,2): 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = (4*3*2!) / (2! * 2!) = (4*3)/2 = 6.\n\nC(6,2): 6! / (2! * 4!) = (6*5*4!)/(2! * 4!) = (6*5)/2 = 15.\n\nC(10,2): 10! / (2! * 8!) = (10*9*8!)/(2! * 8!) = (10*9)/2 = 45.\n\nSo, 6/45 + 15/45 = 21/45, which simplifies to 7/15. Again, the same answer.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct probability is 7/15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{15}} \\]"
