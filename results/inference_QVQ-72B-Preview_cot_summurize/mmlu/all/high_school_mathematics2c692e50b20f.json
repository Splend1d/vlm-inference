                    "text": "So Jennifer is running a marathon, which is 26.2 miles in total. She runs the first half at 8 mph and the second half at 6 mph. I need to find out how long it takes her to complete the race. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what \"first half\" and \"second half\" mean in terms of distance. The total distance is 26.2 miles, so half of that would be 13.1 miles. So, she runs the first 13.1 miles at 8 mph and the second 13.1 miles at 6 mph.\n\nNow, to find the time it takes to run each half, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo for the first half:\n\nTime1 = 13.1 miles / 8 mph\n\nAnd for the second half:\n\nTime2 = 13.1 miles / 6 mph\n\nThen, the total time is Time1 + Time2.\n\nLet me calculate Time1:\n\n13.1 / 8 = 1.6375 hours\n\nAnd Time2:\n\n13.1 / 6 \u2248 2.1833 hours\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n1.6375 + 2.1833 \u2248 3.8208 hours\n\nLooking back at the options, 3.82 is the closest answer.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, 13.1 divided by 8 is indeed 1.6375 hours.\n\nSecond, 13.1 divided by 6 is approximately 2.1833 hours.\n\nAdding those together gives about 3.82 hours.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be approximately 3.82 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3.82} \\]"
