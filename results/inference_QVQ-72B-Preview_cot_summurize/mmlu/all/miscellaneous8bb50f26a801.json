Cinco de Mayo, D. Christmas. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that Mexico does celebrate a few holidays throughout the year, and some of them are well-known internationally. Let's see, Mexican Independence Day\u2014that sounds familiar. I think Mexico's Independence Day is in September, like the 16th or something, not May. Yeah, I believe it's September 16th, so that would make option A incorrect.\n\nNext, Santa Anna's Birthday. Who was Santa Anna? I recall he was a military figure in Mexican history, maybe a president or a general. But I don't think his birthday is a national holiday. In fact, I don't remember Mexico celebrating individual birthdays as national holidays, especially not for historical figures. So, option B seems unlikely.\n\nNow, Cinco de Mayo. That rings a bell. I think it's a holiday celebrated on May 5th, at least in some parts of Mexico and heavily in the United States, especially in areas with large Mexican populations. But what does it celebrate? I think it's about a battle victory or something like that. Wait, I think it commemorates the Mexican Army's victory over the French in the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. Yeah, that sounds right. So, that would make Cinco de Mayo a significant holiday celebrated on May 5th in Mexico.\n\nLastly, Christmas. I know Christmas is celebrated on December 25th, so that's definitely not May 5th. So, option D is out.\n\nSo, between the options given, C. Cinco de Mayo seems to be the correct answer. It's a holiday celebrated on May 5th, and it's recognized in Mexico.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should double-check. Is there any other holiday in Mexico that might be celebrated on May 5th? Let me think about it. There's the Day of the Holy Cross, which is on May 3rd, but that's not May 5th. There's also the Birthday of Benito Ju\u00e1rez, which is on March 21st. No, that's not May 5th either.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a religious holiday on May 5th that I'm not aware of. Let me think about the liturgical calendar. May 5th could be associated with a saint's day or something, but I don't recall any major religious holidays on that date in Mexico.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a modern celebration or a local festival that takes place on May 5th in Mexico. But again, nothing comes to mind besides Cinco de Mayo.\n\nI think I'm pretty confident with my choice here. Cinco de Mayo is indeed a holiday celebrated in Mexico on May 5th, and it marks an important historical event\u2014the victory at the Battle of Puebla.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if Cinco de Mayo is actually considered a national holiday in Mexico. I've heard that while it's a significant celebration in some regions of Mexico, especially in Puebla where the battle took place, it might not be as widely observed nationwide as other holidays like Independence Day or D\u00eda de los Muertos.\n\nHowever, regardless of its national status, it's still a recognized holiday on May 5th, and it's celebrated in various ways, including parades, festivals, and traditional meals.\n\nSo, all things considered, I believe the correct answer is C. Cinco de Mayo.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Cinco de Mayo}} \\]"
