After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.\u2026 At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.\n\u2014Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912\nA settlement house worker was most likely to be motivated by which of the following?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out what would motivate a settlement house worker, like Jane Addams from Hull House. The options are the Social Gospel, Social Darwinism, Communism, or support from an urban political machine. Let me think about each one.\n\nFirst, the Social Gospel. I remember that the Social Gospel was a movement in Protestant circles in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was about applying Christian ethics to social problems, especially issues of poverty and inequality. Settlement house workers were often involved in addressing these kinds of issues, providing education, healthcare, and other services to poor communities. So, the Social Gospel seems relevant because it emphasized the moral responsibility to improve social conditions, which aligns with the work of settlement houses.\n\nNext, Social Darwinism. I know that Social Darwinism was a theory that applied the concept of natural selection to human societies. It suggested that only the strongest individuals or societies would survive, and that interfering with this process could be harmful. This seems contradictory to the work of settlement houses, which were all about intervening to help the less fortunate. If anything, Social Darwinism would discourage such charitable efforts because it views them as interfering with the natural order. So, I doubt that Social Darwinism would motivate settlement house workers.\n\nThen there's Communism. Communism is a political and economic ideology that advocates for a classless society where means of production are owned collectively. Settlement house workers were involved in community organizing and improving living conditions, but they weren't necessarily advocating for the abolition of private property or the establishment of a communist state. While some individuals in the progressive movement might have sympathized with communist ideas, the settlement house movement was generally more focused on reform within existing capitalist structures rather than revolutionary change. So, communism doesn't seem like the primary motivation for settlement house workers.\n\nLastly, support from an urban political machine. Political machines were powerful organizations in many cities during this period, often providing services in exchange for political loyalty and votes. Settlement houses sometimes worked with political machines, but they were generally independent organizations with their own agendas. Moreover, settlement house workers were often progressives who were critical of the corruption and patronage systems of political machines. While they might have accepted support from political machines when it aligned with their goals, their primary motivation wasn't to support the political machine itself.\n\nConsidering all this, the Social Gospel seems to be the most fitting motivation for settlement house workers. It provided a moral and religious framework for their work in improving social conditions and helping the less fortunate. The other options either contradict the goals of settlement houses or don't directly align with their primary motivations.\n\nJust to make sure, let me look back at the passage. Jane Addams talks about supporting striking workers and setting up a boarding club to help them stand together during hard times. This kind of community support and solidarity aligns with the Social Gospel's emphasis on social justice and Christian responsibility to aid those in need.\n\nAlso, I recall that Jane Addams was involved in various reform movements, including women's suffrage and peace activism, which were also motivated by progressive ideals and a desire to make society more just and equitable. The Social Gospel was a key influence on these movements.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. The Social Gospel.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
