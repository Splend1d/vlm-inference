                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about an object floating in water, and I need to find out what percentage of its volume is above the water surface. Let's see, I remember that when something floats in water, it displaces an amount of water that weighs as much as the weight of the object. That's Archimedes' principle, right?\n\nSo, the object has a weight of 6 N and a volume of 2 \u00d7 10^-3 m^3. It's floating in water, which has a density of 1000 kg/m^3. I need to find the percentage of its volume that's above the water.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how much of the object is submerged, right? Because if I know that, I can subtract it from the total volume to find the part that's above water.\n\nThe buoyant force (F_b) equals the weight of the water displaced by the object. Since the object is floating, the buoyant force should equal the weight of the object. So, F_b = weight of object.\n\nSo, F_b = 6 N.\n\nBut F_b is also equal to the weight of the water displaced, which is the density of water times the submerged volume (V_submerged) times gravity.\n\nSo, F_b = \u03c1 * V_submerged * g\n\nI know \u03c1 is 1000 kg/m^3 and g is 9.81 m/s^2.\n\nSo, 6 N = 1000 kg/m^3 * V_submerged * 9.81 m/s^2\n\nI can solve for V_submerged:\n\nV_submerged = 6 / (1000 * 9.81)\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n1000 * 9.81 = 9810\n\n6 / 9810 = 0.000611 m^3\n\nSo, V_submerged = 0.000611 m^3\n\nNow, the total volume is 2 \u00d7 10^-3 m^3, which is 0.002 m^3.\n\nTo find the volume above water, I subtract V_submerged from the total volume:\n\nV_above = total volume - V_submerged = 0.002 - 0.000611 = 0.001389 m^3\n\nNow, to find the percentage of the volume that's above water, I divide the V_above by the total volume and multiply by 100:\n\nPercentage above = (V_above / total volume) * 100 = (0.001389 / 0.002) * 100\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n0.001389 / 0.002 = 0.6945\n\n0.6945 * 100 = 69.45%\n\nSo, approximately 69.45%, which rounds to 70%.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 12%\n\nB. 30%\n\nC. 60%\n\nD. 70%\n\nSo, option D seems to be the answer.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, F_b = \u03c1 * V_submerged * g\n\nGiven F_b = 6 N, \u03c1 = 1000 kg/m^3, g = 9.81 m/s^2\n\nSo, V_submerged = 6 / (1000 * 9.81) = 6 / 9810 = 0.00061176 m^3\n\nTotal volume = 2 \u00d7 10^-3 m^3 = 0.002 m^3\n\nV_above = 0.002 - 0.00061176 = 0.00138824 m^3\n\nPercentage above = (0.00138824 / 0.002) * 100 = 69.412%, which rounds to 70%.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the density of the object compared to water. If the object is floating, its density is less than or equal to the density of water.\n\nLet me calculate the density of the object:\n\nDensity (\u03c1_object) = weight / (g * volume) = 6 N / (9.81 m/s^2 * 0.002 m^3) = 6 / (9.81 * 0.002)\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n9.81 * 0.002 = 0.01962 kg/m^3\n\nSo, \u03c1_object = 6 / 0.01962 \u2248 305.97 kg/m^3\n\nNow, the fraction submerged should be equal to the density of the object divided by the density of water.\n\nSo, fraction submerged = \u03c1_object / \u03c1_water = 305.97 / 1000 = 0.30597, or 30.597%\n\nBut this is the fraction submerged, not the fraction above water.\n\nSo, the fraction above water would be 100% - 30.597% \u2248 69.403%, which again is approximately 70%.\n\nSo, this confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 70%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
