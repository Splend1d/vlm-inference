                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about gas expansion. So, there's a gas in a 2.0-liter container at 2.4 atmospheres pressure, and it's allowed to expand against an external pressure of 0.80 atmosphere. I need to find the work involved, and there are options given: A. -3.2 L atm, B. -9.6 L atm, C. -4.8 L atm, D. +14.4 L atm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for work done during gas expansion. I know that work done by a gas during expansion is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ w = -P_{\\text{ext}} \\times \\Delta V \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( P_{\\text{ext}} \\) is the external pressure against which the gas is expanding,\n\n- \\( \\Delta V \\) is the change in volume during the expansion.\n\nSince the gas is expanding, \\( \\Delta V \\) is positive (because the final volume is larger than the initial volume), and the work done by the gas is negative (since work is done by the system on the surroundings).\n\nBut wait, in this problem, the initial pressure is 2.4 atm, and the external pressure is 0.80 atm. Is this an isobaric process? Actually, I'm a bit confused. In an isobaric process, the pressure remains constant, but here, the external pressure is different from the initial pressure of the gas. So, I think this is not an isobaric process.\n\nMaybe it's an adiabatic process? No, adiabatic processes involve no heat transfer, which isn't mentioned here. Perhaps it's an isothermal process? But again, temperature isn't specified.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the entire process. The gas is in a container at 2.4 atm, and it's expanding against an external pressure of 0.80 atm. I think the key here is that the gas is expanding against a constant external pressure, so the work done would indeed be \\( w = -P_{\\text{ext}} \\times \\Delta V \\).\n\nBut I need to find the final volume to calculate \\( \\Delta V \\). How can I find the final volume?\n\nI recall that when a gas expands against a constant external pressure, it will expand until its internal pressure equals the external pressure. So, at the final state, the pressure of the gas should be equal to the external pressure, which is 0.80 atm.\n\nGiven that, I can use the ideal gas law to find the final volume.\n\nWait, but I don't know the amount of gas or the temperature. Hmm, maybe I can use the formula for reversible expansion, but that seems complicated without knowing more variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that the expansion is irreversible, and use the formula \\( w = -P_{\\text{ext}} \\times (V_f - V_i) \\), where \\( V_f \\) is the final volume and \\( V_i \\) is the initial volume.\n\nGiven that, I need to find \\( V_f \\).\n\nLet me think about it differently. If the gas is expanding against a constant external pressure of 0.80 atm, and it starts at 2.4 atm, it will expand until its pressure equals 0.80 atm.\n\nAssuming the temperature remains constant (though it's not specified), I can use Boyle's law: \\( P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2 \\).\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\( P_1 = 2.4 \\) atm\n\n- \\( V_1 = 2.0 \\) L\n\n- \\( P_2 = 0.80 \\) atm\n\n- \\( V_2 = ? \\)\n\nSo, \\( V_2 = \\frac{P_1 V_1}{P_2} = \\frac{2.4 \\times 2.0}{0.80} = \\frac{4.8}{0.80} = 6.0 \\) L\n\nTherefore, \\( \\Delta V = V_2 - V_1 = 6.0 - 2.0 = 4.0 \\) L\n\nNow, work done by the gas is:\n\n\\[ w = -P_{\\text{ext}} \\times \\Delta V = -0.80 \\times 4.0 = -3.2 \\) L atm\n\nSo, the work done by the gas is -3.2 L atm, which means the gas does 3.2 L atm of work on the surroundings.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. -3.2 L atm.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Is there another way to approach this?\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might think of using the formula for work in a reversible isothermal expansion, which is \\( w = -nRT \\ln \\left( \\frac{V_f}{V_i} \\right) \\), but that's for a reversible process, and here it's specified that the gas is expanding against a constant external pressure, which is typically an irreversible process.\n\nSo, using the simpler formula \\( w = -P_{\\text{ext}} \\times \\Delta V \\) seems appropriate.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the process is isothermal or not. If it's isothermal, the temperature remains constant, and the internal energy doesn't change. But since temperature isn't specified, I can't assume that.\n\nHowever, in the absence of more information, and given that the problem specifies expansion against a constant external pressure, the standard approach is to use \\( w = -P_{\\text{ext}} \\times \\Delta V \\).\n\nSo, I think -3.2 L atm is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. -3.2\\ \\text{L atm}} \\]"
