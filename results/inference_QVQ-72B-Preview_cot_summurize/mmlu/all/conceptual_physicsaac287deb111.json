                    "text": "So I have this question about mirrors, and I need to figure out how far behind the mirror my image is. The options are:\n\nA. Half my height\n\nB. Half my distance from the mirror\n\nC. Your distance in front of the mirror\n\nD. More than your distance in front of the mirror\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a plane mirror forms an image that's the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of it. So, if I'm standing 2 meters in front of the mirror, my image should be 2 meters behind it, right? That sounds like option C: your distance in front of the mirror.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Option A says half your height. I know that the height of the image in a plane mirror is the same as the height of the object, so if I'm 1.7 meters tall, my image is also 1.7 meters tall. But that's not related to the distance behind the mirror. So, maybe A is not correct.\n\nOption B says half your distance from the mirror. If I'm 2 meters away, would my image be 1 meter behind? That doesn't seem right. I think the image should be exactly 2 meters behind the mirror, same as my distance from it.\n\nOption D says more than your distance in front of the mirror. So, if I'm 2 meters away, would my image be more than 2 meters behind? No, I think it's exactly the same distance.\n\nLet me consider the principle of reflection. When light rays hit a plane mirror, they reflect at the same angle as they hit. So, for an object placed a certain distance in front of the mirror, the image formed is directly behind the mirror at the same distance. There's no enlargement or reduction in distance; it's a virtual, upright image that's the same size as the object.\n\nI recall there's a formula for the image distance in a plane mirror. Let's see, the formula for the image distance (i) in terms of the object distance (o) is:\n\ni = o\n\nYes, that's straightforward. So, the image distance is equal to the object distance. That directly points to option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about the mirror formula for spherical mirrors. For plane mirrors, the mirror formula simplifies because the curvature radius is infinite, and the focal length is also infinite. So, the image distance is simply equal to the object distance.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the line of sight. If you look at your image in the mirror, the path of light from you to the mirror and then to your eye should make equal angles with the normal at the point of reflection. This symmetry ensures that the image appears to be as far behind the mirror as you are in front of it.\n\nLet me also consider an example. Suppose I'm standing 3 meters away from a plane mirror. Where is my image? Well, if I move closer to the mirror, my image moves closer too, always maintaining that equal distance. So, at 3 meters, my image should be 3 meters behind the mirror.\n\nWait a minute, could there be any situation where the image distance isn't exactly equal to the object distance? Maybe if the mirror isn't perfectly flat or if there's some distortion, but in an ideal case, it should be equal.\n\nPerhaps the other options are there to confuse. Option A mentions half your height, which relates to something else, maybe magnification, but in plane mirrors, the magnification is 1, meaning the image size is the same as the object size.\n\nOption B, half your distance from the mirror, doesn't make sense in this context. Why would the image be half the distance? That seems arbitrary.\n\nOption D says more than your distance in front of the mirror. If the image is exactly the same distance behind, it can't be more than that distance.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I'm confident that the correct answer is option C: your distance in front of the mirror.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
