                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these objections isn't made by Kass against cloning. The options are:\n\nA. It constitutes unethical experimentation.\n\nB. It threatens identity and individuality.\n\nC. It will produce harmful biological mutations as clones produce further clones.\n\nD. It perverts our values concerning parenthood and the raising of children.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Kass has said about cloning. I know that Leon Kass is an American public intellectual and philosopher who has written extensively on bioethics, including the ethics of cloning. He's generally critical of cloning, especially reproductive cloning, which involves creating a genetically identical copy of an existing individual.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: It constitutes unethical experimentation.\n\nI remember that Kass has expressed concerns about the moral status of cloned embryos and the potential for harm to the cloned individuals. He might argue that cloning involves treating human life as a product of manufacturing rather than as a gift of nature or a result of procreation. This could be seen as unethical experimentation, especially since cloning technology is still in its early stages and may pose risks to the health and well-being of the clones.\n\nSo, this seems like a valid objection from Kass.\n\nOption B: It threatens identity and individuality.\n\nKass has written about the importance of uniqueness and individuality in human beings. Cloning creates an individual who is genetically identical to another person, which might raise questions about the clone's identity. Is the clone a unique person or just a copy? Kass might worry that cloning could erode the sense of individuality and uniqueness that we typically associate with being human.\n\nThis seems like another objection he would make.\n\nOption C: It will produce harmful biological mutations as clones produce further clones.\n\nThis one is a bit more specific. It suggests that cloning, especially if practiced over multiple generations, could lead to the accumulation of harmful mutations. While it's true that cloning can introduce errors and mutations, I'm not sure if Kass has specifically focused on this aspect.\n\nLet me think about it. Cloning involves replicating DNA and transferring it to an enucleated egg cell. This process can sometimes lead to epigenetic abnormalities or other defects. However, suggesting that clones producing further clones would necessarily lead to harmful mutations seems like a stretch. After all, natural reproduction also carries the risk of mutations and genetic disorders.\n\nI don't recall Kass emphasizing this particular point. Maybe he has mentioned potential health risks associated with cloning, but the idea of clones producing further clones leading to harmful mutations seems more like a hypothetical scenario rather than a direct objection he has made.\n\nOption D: It perverts our values concerning parenthood and the raising of children.\n\nKass has been critical of how cloning could alter our understanding of parenthood and family structures. He values the traditional model of procreation involving a mother and a father, and cloning could disrupt this model by allowing someone to have a genetically identical offspring without the involvement of another parent.\n\nThis objection seems consistent with his views.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, A, B, and D seem to align with Kass's objections to cloning, while C appears to be more of a speculative concern about biological mutations in successive generations of clones, which isn't directly attributed to Kass's writings.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. It will produce harmful biological mutations as clones produce further clones.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
