                    "text": "So I need to find the quotient of 2.16 divided by 0.06. Let's see, division can sometimes be tricky, especially when dealing with decimals. I remember that dividing by a decimal is similar to dividing by a whole number if I move the decimal points in both numbers.\n\nFirst, I should adjust the decimals so that I'm dividing by a whole number. To do that, I need to move the decimal point in the divisor, 0.06, to the right until it becomes a whole number. There are two digits after the decimal point in 0.06, so I'll move the decimal point two places to the right, turning 0.06 into 6.\n\nNow, to keep the equation balanced, I need to move the decimal point in the dividend, 2.16, by the same number of places. So, I'll move the decimal point two places to the right, turning 2.16 into 216.\n\nNow, the problem becomes 216 divided by 6.\n\nLet me think about how to divide 216 by 6. I can start by seeing how many times 6 goes into 21. 6 times 3 is 18, which is less than 21, and 6 times 4 is 24, which is more than 21. So, 6 goes into 21 three times. I'll write down 3 and subtract 18 from 21, leaving me with 3.\n\nNext, I bring down the next digit, which is 6, making it 36. Now, how many times does 6 go into 36? 6 times 6 is 36, exactly. So, I write down 6 and subtract 36 from 36, leaving me with 0.\n\nSo, the quotient is 36.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can use another method to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about dividing decimals is to use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{a \\times 10^{n}}{b \\times 10^{n}}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, I moved the decimals two places to the right, which is equivalent to multiplying both numerator and denominator by 100.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2.16}{0.06} = \\frac{2.16 \\times 100}{0.06 \\times 100} = \\frac{216}{6} = 36\n\\]\n\nThat matches my earlier result. Just to be thorough, maybe I can use division on a calculator to verify.\n\nCalculating 2.16 \u00f7 0.06:\n\n2.16 \u00f7 0.06 = 36\n\nYes, that confirms it again.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of multiples. What number multiplied by 0.06 gives 2.16?\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n0.06 \\times x = 2.16\n\\]\n\nTo solve for x, I can divide both sides by 0.06:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{2.16}{0.06} = 36\n\\]\n\nAgain, I get the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently. So, the correct quotient is 36.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 3.6\n\nB. 36\n\nC. 0.01272\n\nD. 12.72\n\nThe correct answer is B. 36.\n\nJust to make sure there's no confusion, maybe I should consider if there's a common mistake I could have made.\n\nOne common mistake when moving decimal points is not moving them the same number of places in both the divisor and the dividend. In this case, I moved both decimals two places to the right, which is correct.\n\nAnother mistake could be miscounting the number of decimal places. For example, if I had only moved one decimal place, 0.06 would become 0.6, and 2.16 would become 21.6, leading to a different quotient:\n\n21.6 \u00f7 0.6 = 36\n\nWait, actually, that still gives me 36. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider moving the decimal one place to the right:\n\n2.16 becomes 21.6\n\n0.06 becomes 0.6\n\nThen, dividing 21.6 by 0.6:\n\n21.6 \u00f7 0.6 = 36\n\nAgain, I get 36.\n\nAlternatively, if I move the decimals three places:\n\n2.16 becomes 2160\n\n0.06 becomes 60\n\nThen, 2160 \u00f7 60 = 36\n\nStill 36.\n\nIt seems no matter how many places I move the decimals, as long as I move them the same number of places in both numbers, the quotient remains 36.\n\nPerhaps another angle: using long division.\n\nLet's try dividing 2.16 by 0.06 directly using long division, without moving the decimals.\n\nSo, set up the division:\n\n0.06 | 2.16\n\nFirst, look at how many times 0.06 goes into 2.16.\n\n0.06 \u00d7 36 = 2.16\n\nBecause 0.06 \u00d7 30 = 1.80\n\nAnd 0.06 \u00d7 6 = 0.36\n\nAdding them up: 1.80 + 0.36 = 2.16\n\nSo, 36 times.\n\nAgain, confirming that the quotient is 36.\n\nI think I've exhausted all possible ways to confirm this, and each method points to the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. 36.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 36} \\]"
