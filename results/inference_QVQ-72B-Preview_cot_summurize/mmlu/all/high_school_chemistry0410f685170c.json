                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of the following does not contain oxygen? A. An aldehyde, B. An alkane, C. An alcohol, D. An ether.\" Hmm, I need to recall what each of these is and whether they contain oxygen.\n\nFirst, let's think about aldehydes. I remember that aldehydes are organic compounds that have a carbonyl group (that's a carbon double-bonded to an oxygen) at the end of a chain. So, like, formaldehyde is the simplest one, and it's CH2O. Definitely has oxygen. So, option A, an aldehyde, does contain oxygen.\n\nNext, alcohols. Alcohols have a hydroxyl group, which is an oxygen bonded to a hydrogen, attached to a carbon chain. So, ethanol, for example, is C2H5OH. There's clearly an oxygen in there. So, option C, an alcohol, also contains oxygen.\n\nThen, ethers. Ethers have an oxygen atom bonded to two carbon atoms. Like, diethyl ether is C4H10O. So, again, oxygen is present. So, option D, an ether, contains oxygen.\n\nNow, alkanes. Alkanes are hydrocarbons, meaning they consist only of carbon and hydrogen atoms. They don't have any other elements. So, methane is CH4, ethane is C2H6, propane is C3H8, and so on. None of these have oxygen. So, option B, an alkane, does not contain oxygen.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. Is there any possibility that an alkane could have oxygen under certain conditions? Maybe as a substituent or something? No, I don't think so. Alkanes are purely carbon and hydrogen, no oxygen atoms present.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. An alkane does not contain oxygen.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there are any exceptions or special cases. For example, if an alkane has some sort of oxygen-containing group attached, but no, that would make it something else, like an alcohol or an ether. Alkanes themselves do not contain oxygen.\n\nAlright, I'm pretty confident now. The correct answer is B. An alkane.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
