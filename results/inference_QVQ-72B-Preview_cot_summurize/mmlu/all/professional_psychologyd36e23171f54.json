                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this scenario involving Dr. Maxine Miller, a school psychologist, and a non-custodial parent who's requesting the test results of his 5th-grade son. The question is asking what Dr. Miller would be doing if she complies with the father's request\u2014 is it legal and ethical, legal but unethical, illegal and unethical, or illegal but ethical?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and ethical considerations involved here. As a school psychologist, Dr. Miller is bound by both legal requirements and professional ethical standards.\n\nLet me start by considering the legal aspects. There are laws that govern the privacy of student information, particularly in the United States. One key law is the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which protects the privacy of student education records. Under FERPA, parents have certain rights regarding their children's education records, such as the right to review them.\n\nHowever, FERPA also addresses situations where parental rights transfer to the student when the student reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. In this case, since the student is in 5th grade, he's likely under 18 and not attending a postsecondary institution, so parental rights should still apply.\n\nBut here's the catch: the parent requesting the information is the non-custodial parent. I need to consider whether non-custodial parents have the same rights as custodial parents under FERPA.\n\nUpon checking, FERPA generally does not distinguish between custodial and non-custodial parents. Unless there's a court order or state law specifying otherwise, both parents have equal rights to access their child's education records. So, absent such a court order or state law, Dr. Miller would be required to provide the test results to the non-custodial parent upon request.\n\nNow, let's consider the ethical considerations. The American Psychological Association (APA) has ethical principles that guide psychologists' conduct, including school psychologists. One relevant principle is confidentiality.\n\nPsychologists are required to protect the confidentiality of client information, releasing it only with the client's consent or as permitted by law. In the case of minors, this consent is typically provided by a parent or legal guardian.\n\nGiven that the non-custodial parent is requesting the information, and assuming there's no court order restricting his access, providing the information would align with both legal requirements and ethical guidelines.\n\nHowever, if there is a court order specifying that the non-custodial parent should not have access to the child's educational records, then complying with the request could be illegal and potentially unethical.\n\nSimilarly, if state law in this jurisdiction differs from the general FERPA provisions regarding parental access rights, that could affect the answer.\n\nAssuming no such court order exists and that state law doesn't restrict the non-custodial parent's access, then Dr. Miller would be acting legally and ethically by complying with the father's request.\n\nBut the question is phrased to suggest that there might be an ethical issue even if providing the information is legal. So, perhaps there are ethical considerations beyond just following the law.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Maybe there's a concern about the non-custodial parent's intentions or the potential impact on the child if sensitive information is shared.\n\nFor example, if the tests reveal information about the child's learning disabilities or mental health issues, and the non-custodial parent might use this information in a way that could harm the child, there might be an ethical dilemma.\n\nHowever, according to standard ethical guidelines, psychologists are bound to follow the law unless there's a compelling reason to deviate, and even then, they must take steps to resolve the conflict.\n\nIn other words, if the law requires Dr. Miller to provide the information to the non-custodial parent, and there's no legal basis to withhold it, she must comply, even if she has ethical concerns.\n\nConversely, if there's a legal basis to withhold the information, such as a court order, then she must follow that order, again aligning with both legal and ethical standards.\n\nGiven that, I need to consider whether there's any information in the scenario that suggests a court order or state law restricts the non-custodial parent's access to the child's educational records.\n\nThe scenario doesn't mention any such restrictions, so I have to assume that Dr. Miller is required to comply with the request, both legally and ethically.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. legally and ethically.\n\nBut let's double-check. Suppose there's a situation where providing the information could cause harm to the child, perhaps by leading to conflicts between the parents.\n\nIn such a case, might there be an ethical justification for withholding the information, despite legal requirements?\n\nThe APA's Ethical Principles for Psychologists and Code of Conduct include a principle of nonmaleficence, which requires psychologists to avoid harming their clients.\n\nIf Dr. Miller has reason to believe that providing the information could cause harm to the child, she might face an ethical conflict between maintaining confidentiality and preventing harm.\n\nIn such a scenario, she would need to seek guidance, possibly consulting with legal counsel or ethical review boards, to find a way to balance these concerns.\n\nHowever, without specific information suggesting that providing the test results would cause harm, it's not appropriate to assume that complying with the request would be unethical.\n\nMoreover, the scenario doesn't provide any indication that there's a risk of harm; it simply presents a request from a non-custodial parent for test results.\n\nTherefore, in this context, complying with the request would be both legal and ethical.\n\nSo, my final answer is A. legally and ethically.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
