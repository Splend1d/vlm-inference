                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about logical fallacies. It says that asking a question which includes an unproven assumption may lead to which of the following fallacies: Appeal to ignorance, Extension, a priori, or Complex question. Hmm, I need to recall what each of these terms means and see which one fits the description.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. If someone asks a question that contains an assumption that hasn't been proven, what kind of fallacy might that be? It's probably a type of fallacy that involves faulty reasoning or assuming something without evidence.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A is Appeal to ignorance. I think Appeal to Ignorance is when someone claims something is true because it hasn't been proven false, or vice versa. Like saying, \"Well, you can't prove that aliens aren't real, so they must exist.\" That seems different from asking a question with an unproven assumption. Maybe not the right choice.\n\nOption B is Extension. I'm not as familiar with this term in the context of fallacies. Maybe it refers to extending an argument beyond what the evidence supports, but I'm not sure. Perhaps it's not directly related to asking questions with unproven assumptions.\n\nOption C is a priori. A priori knowledge is what you know independently of experience, like mathematical truths or logical deductions. A priori reasoning is based on theory rather than observation. But again, I'm not sure how this directly relates to asking questions that contain unproven assumptions. Maybe not the best fit.\n\nOption D is Complex question. This sounds promising. A complex question is one that presupposes something that hasn't been established. For example, \"Have you stopped cheating on tests?\" presupposes that you were cheating in the first place, which might not be true. So, this seems like it fits the description of including an unproven assumption in a question.\n\nWait a minute, I think this is called a loaded question fallacy or argument from question. It's when a question is phrased in such a way that it assumes a certain fact or premise that hasn't been proven or agreed upon. So, yes, that aligns perfectly with what the question is describing.\n\nLet me double-check. If I ask a question that includes an unproven assumption, I'm essentially committing a complex question fallacy. For example, \"Do you think that the government should apologize for the rising taxes?\" This question assumes that taxes are rising, which might not be a proven fact. It's loading that assumption into the question.\n\nComparing this back to the other options:\n\n- Appeal to ignorance: That's more about claiming something is true because it hasn't been disproven.\n\n- Extension: Not sure, but it doesn't seem directly related to questioning.\n\n- A priori: This is about knowledge independent of experience, not about fallacies in questioning.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, Option D, Complex question, seems to be the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another example. Suppose someone asks, \"How has your business improved since implementing our software?\" This question assumes that the software has improved the business, which might not be the case. It's a complex question because it contains an unproven assumption.\n\nAnother example: \"What steps have you taken to recover from your addiction?\" This question assumes that the person has an addiction and is recovering from it, which might not be true.\n\nIn both cases, these questions are complex questions because they presuppose something that hasn't been established.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is D. Complex question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
