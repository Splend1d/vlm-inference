                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about GMOs in food, and it's about opponents' fears. The options are:\n\nA. Will hinder global trade.\n\nB. Make plants more resistant to disease.\n\nC. May cause irreversible changes in humans.\n\nD. Make plants more resistant to drought.\n\nHmm, first off, I need to understand what GMOs are. GMO stands for genetically modified organisms. That means their DNA has been altered in a way that doesn't occur naturally, often by introducing genes from other organisms to get desired traits like better yield, pest resistance, or longer shelf life.\n\nNow, the question is about opponents' fears. So, I need to think about what concerns people have about GMOs in food.\n\nOption A says they will hinder global trade. But actually, GMOs are widely used in many countries, and they can facilitate trade by increasing crop yields and reducing costs. However, some countries have restrictions on GMO imports, which could affect trade. But I don't think that's a primary concern for opponents.\n\nOption B says GMOs make plants more resistant to disease. Actually, one of the goals of genetic modification is to make plants more resistant to diseases and pests, which can be beneficial. So, this seems like a positive aspect, not a fear.\n\nOption C says GMOs may cause irreversible changes in humans. This sounds like a potential health concern. Opponents might worry that consuming GMO foods could lead to unknown health effects, possibly including genetic changes in humans. This seems plausible as a fear.\n\nOption D says GMOs make plants more resistant to drought. Again, this is another beneficial trait that genetic modification can confer on plants, helping them survive in harsher conditions. This is generally seen as positive.\n\nSo, between options A, C, and D, option C seems the most likely concern for opponents of GMOs in food. Fears about health impacts, especially long-term and irreversible changes in humans, are commonly cited by those opposed to GMOs.\n\nLet me double-check. I recall that there are debates about the safety of GMOs in food, with some people worrying about allergic reactions, antibiotic resistance, or other health issues that might be caused by consuming GMOs. While there is scientific consensus that currently available GMO foods are safe to eat, there are still concerns about potential unknown risks.\n\nTherefore, option C, \"may cause irreversible changes in humans,\" seems to align with these concerns. Options A, B, and D don't seem to directly relate to the fears of GMO opponents in the context provided.\n\nSo, my answer would be C. May cause irreversible changes in humans.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
