                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of the following decimal numbers has an exact representation in binary notation? The options are A. 0.1, B. 0.2, C. 0.3, and D. 0.5.\n\nOkay, I need to figure out which of these decimal fractions can be exactly represented in binary form. I know that some decimal fractions can't be expressed exactly in binary, just like some fractions in decimal form repeat forever.\n\nFirst, I should recall how decimal fractions are represented in binary. In binary, fractions are represented using negative powers of 2. So, for example, 0.5 in decimal is exactly 0.1 in binary because 0.5 is 2^-1.\n\nWait, actually, 0.5 is 1/2, which is exactly representable in binary. So option D seems like a possible answer.\n\nNow, let's look at option A: 0.1. In binary, is 0.1 exactly representable? I think not, because 0.1 in decimal is a repeating fraction in binary. Let me try to convert 0.1 decimal to binary to see.\n\nTo convert a decimal fraction to binary, I can multiply it by 2 repeatedly and take note of the integer parts. So, 0.1 * 2 = 0.2, so the first binary digit after the point is 0. Then, 0.2 * 2 = 0.4, another 0. Continue this process: 0.4 * 2 = 0.8 \u2192 0; 0.8 * 2 = 1.6 \u2192 1; 0.6 * 2 = 1.2 \u2192 1; 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 \u2192 0; and it repeats. So, 0.1 decimal is 0.0001100110011... in binary, which is a repeating pattern. Therefore, it's not exactly representable.\n\nSimilarly, option B: 0.2. Let's try converting that. 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 \u2192 0; 0.4 * 2 = 0.8 \u2192 0; 0.8 * 2 = 1.6 \u2192 1; 0.6 * 2 = 1.2 \u2192 1; 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 \u2192 0; and it starts repeating. So, 0.2 decimal is also a repeating fraction in binary.\n\nOption C: 0.3. 0.3 * 2 = 0.6 \u2192 0; 0.6 * 2 = 1.2 \u2192 1; 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 \u2192 0; 0.4 * 2 = 0.8 \u2192 0; 0.8 * 2 = 1.6 \u2192 1; and it seems to continue in a repeating pattern. So, 0.3 is also a repeating fraction in binary.\n\nLastly, option D: 0.5. As I thought earlier, 0.5 is exactly 0.1 in binary because 0.5 is 2^-1. So, no repeating here; it's exactly representable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. 0.5.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe in terms of fractions and their denominators. I recall that a decimal fraction can be expressed exactly in binary if its denominator is a power of 2 when reduced to lowest terms.\n\nSo, let's check each option:\n\nA. 0.1 is 1/10. The denominator is 10, which is 2 * 5. Since it has a factor of 5, which is not a power of 2, it can't be exactly represented in binary.\n\nB. 0.2 is 1/5. Denominator is 5, not a power of 2, so it's not exactly representable.\n\nC. 0.3 is 3/10. Denominator is 10, which has a factor of 5, not a power of 2.\n\nD. 0.5 is 1/2, which is exactly 2^-1 in binary.\n\nThis reinforces that 0.5 is the correct choice.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also consider the binary representations of these numbers in IEEE 754 floating-point format, but since the question is about exact representation in binary notation, converting them to binary fractions directly should suffice.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the decimal number 0.5 has an exact representation in binary notation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
