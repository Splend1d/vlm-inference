                    "text": "So I need to find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2)) over Q. The options are 0, 2, 1, and 3. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that the degree of a field extension F over K, denoted by [F : K], is the dimension of F as a vector space over K. So, in this case, Q(sqrt(2)) is the field extension of Q by including sqrt(2).\n\nI need to find a basis for Q(sqrt(2)) over Q. Let's think about what Q(sqrt(2)) consists of. It's all elements of the form a + b*sqrt(2), where a and b are rational numbers. So, elements look like this: for example, 2 + 3*sqrt(2), or 1/2 + 7*sqrt(2), etc.\n\nNow, to find the degree, I need to find a basis for this set over Q. A basis is a set of elements that spans the space and is linearly independent over Q.\n\nLooking at the elements a + b*sqrt(2), it seems like 1 and sqrt(2) could be a basis. Because any element in Q(sqrt(2)) can be written as a linear combination of 1 and sqrt(2) with coefficients in Q.\n\nLet me check if 1 and sqrt(2) are linearly independent over Q. That means that if a*1 + b*sqrt(2) = 0, where a and b are rational, then a = 0 and b = 0.\n\nSo, a + b*sqrt(2) = 0. If a and b are rational, and sqrt(2) is irrational, the only way this can be true is if a = 0 and b = 0. Because if b \u2260 0, then sqrt(2) = -a/b, which would make sqrt(2) rational, which it's not. So, yes, they are linearly independent.\n\nTherefore, a basis for Q(sqrt(2)) over Q is {1, sqrt(2)}, and the degree [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q] is 2.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that the degree could be something else? Like, maybe 4 or something? No, that doesn't seem right.\n\nLet me think about it differently. The minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) over Q is x^2 - 2. Since sqrt(2) is a root of this polynomial, and it's irreducible over Q (by Eisenstein's criterion or just noting that it has no rational roots), the degree of the extension should be the degree of the minimal polynomial, which is 2.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider Q(sqrt(2)) as Q adjoined by sqrt(2), and sqrt(2) satisfies the equation x^2 - 2 = 0, which is of degree 2, then the degree of the extension should be 2.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 2.\n\nWait, but let's see why the other options are wrong.\n\nOption A is 0. That would mean that Q(sqrt(2)) is equal to Q, which it's not, because Q doesn't contain sqrt(2).\n\nOption C is 1. That would mean that Q(sqrt(2)) is equal to Q, which again, it's not.\n\nOption D is 3. That doesn't make sense here because the minimal polynomial is of degree 2, not 3.\n\nSo, yeah, the correct answer is B. 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
