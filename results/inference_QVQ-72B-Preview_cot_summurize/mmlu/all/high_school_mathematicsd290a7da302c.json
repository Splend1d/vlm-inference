                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we're dealing with radioactive decay, and the concept here is half-life. The half-life of a substance is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay. In this problem, the half-life is given as 8 years. We need to find out how long it takes for two-thirds of the substance to decay.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for radioactive decay. I think it's something like \\(N = N_0 \\times (1/2)^{t/T}\\), where \\(N\\) is the amount of substance at time \\(t\\), \\(N_0\\) is the initial amount, \\(T\\) is the half-life, and \\(t\\) is the time elapsed. Is that right? Let me double-check that.\n\nYeah, that's the standard exponential decay formula for substances that decay by half every constant period. So, in this case, \\(N/N_0 = (1/2)^{t/T}\\).\n\nNow, we want two-thirds of the substance to decay. That means that one-third of the original substance remains undecayed, right? Because if two-thirds have decayed, only one-third is left.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation: \\(N/N_0 = 1/3\\), and we know that \\(T = 8\\) years. We need to solve for \\(t\\).\n\nSo, \\(1/3 = (1/2)^{t/8}\\).\n\nHmm, that's an exponential equation. I need to solve for \\(t\\). Maybe I can take the logarithm of both sides to make it easier.\n\nLet's write that:\n\n\\[\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{t/8}\\right)\\]\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule, which is \\(\\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a)\\), so:\n\n\\[\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{t}{8} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\]\n\nNow, I can solve for \\(t\\):\n\n\\[t = 8 \\times \\frac{\\ln(1/3)}{\\ln(1/2)}\\]\n\nOkay, so I need to calculate this expression. Let's see, calculating \\(\\ln(1/3)\\) and \\(\\ln(1/2)\\).\n\nI know that \\(\\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3)\\) and \\(\\ln(1/2) = -\\ln(2)\\). So, plugging in:\n\n\\[t = 8 \\times \\frac{-\\ln(3)}{-\\ln(2)} = 8 \\times \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(2)}\\]\n\nInteresting, the negatives cancel each other out. So, \\(t = 8 \\times \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(2)}\\).\n\nNow, I need to calculate the numerical value of this expression. I should remember that \\(\\ln(2)\\) is approximately 0.6931 and \\(\\ln(3)\\) is approximately 1.0986.\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(2)} \\approx \\frac{1.0986}{0.6931} \\approx 1.58496\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(t \\approx 8 \\times 1.58496 \\approx 12.67968\\) years.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 4.68\n\nB. 7.69\n\nC. 12.21\n\nD. 12.68\n\nSo, 12.67968 is closest to option D. 12.68.\n\nBut wait a minute, maybe there's a more precise way to calculate this or perhaps another approach to the problem.\n\nLet me consider using the general decay formula in terms of the half-life. The general formula for the decay constant \\(\\lambda\\) is \\(\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T}\\), where \\(T\\) is the half-life.\n\nSo, \\(\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{8}\\).\n\nThen, the fraction remaining after time \\(t\\) is \\(N/N_0 = e^{-\\lambda t}\\).\n\nGiven that \\(N/N_0 = 1/3\\), we have:\n\n\\[1/3 = e^{-\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{8}\\right) t}\\]\n\nTaking natural logarithm on both sides:\n\n\\[\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = -\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{8}\\right) t\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[t = -\\frac{8 \\ln(1/3)}{\\ln(2)} = 8 \\times \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(2)}\\]\n\nThis brings me back to the same expression as before.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for the time \\(t\\) required for the substance to decay to a certain fraction \\(f\\):\n\n\\[t = T \\times \\frac{\\ln(f)}{\\ln(0.5)}\\]\n\nIn this case, \\(f = 1/3\\), since one-third remains.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[t = 8 \\times \\frac{\\ln(1/3)}{\\ln(0.5)} = 8 \\times \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(2)}\\]\n\nAgain, the same expression.\n\nI think I'm confident with this approach. Now, calculating it more precisely:\n\nUsing a calculator, \\(\\ln(3) \\approx 1.098612\\) and \\(\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147\\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[t \\approx 8 \\times \\frac{1.098612}{0.693147} = 8 \\times 1.5849625 \\approx 12.679696\\] years.\n\nRounding to two decimal places, that's 12.68 years.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 12.68.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps using the concept of mean life or something, but I don't think that's necessary here since the half-life is given and the standard decay formula should suffice.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the number of half-lives. Each half-life reduces the substance by half. So, if we have two-thirds decayed, that means one-third remains.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\nAfter 1 half-life (8 years), the substance is reduced to half.\n\nAfter 2 half-lives (16 years), it's reduced to a quarter.\n\nAfter 3 half-lives (24 years), it's reduced to an eighth.\n\nBut none of these equal one-third. So, perhaps interpolating between these points could give an approximate answer, but it's less precise than using the formula.\n\nFor example, after 2 half-lives, the substance is down to 1/4, which is less than 1/3.\n\nAfter 1 half-life, it's 1/2, which is more than 1/3.\n\nSo, it's somewhere between 8 and 16 years.\n\nUsing logarithms gives a more precise answer of approximately 12.68 years, which matches option D.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 12.68.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{D}\\]"
