                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about a sphere rolling down a hill without slipping, and it starts from rest. The hill has a constant angle of inclination, and I need to figure out what force provides the torque that causes the sphere to rotate. The options are static friction, kinetic friction, the normal force of the hill on the sphere, or gravity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sphere is at rest at the top of the hill and then starts rolling down. Since it's rolling without slipping, that means there's some friction involved that helps it roll instead of just sliding down. But the problem says \"roll without slipping,\" which probably means that the friction is static, not kinetic, because slipping would involve kinetic friction.\n\nWait, but I need to be careful. Slipping usually involves kinetic friction, and no slipping would involve static friction. So, option A is static friction, and option B is kinetic friction. Maybe static friction is the one providing the torque.\n\nLet me think about torque. Torque is what causes rotational acceleration, right? So, torque is equal to force times the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation, which in this case would be the radius of the sphere, assuming the force is applied tangentially.\n\nGravity is acting downward, and it has a component parallel to the hill that would cause the sphere to slide down. But gravity acts through the center of mass, so it doesn't directly cause torque about the center of the sphere. Wait, but if the sphere is rolling, there must be some torque causing it to rotate.\n\nMaybe the normal force is providing the torque. The normal force is perpendicular to the hill, pushing the sphere upward. But again, it's acting through the point of contact, so I'm not sure if it causes torque.\n\nGravity has a component down the hill, which would cause the sphere to slide, but friction is opposing that slide and also providing the torque needed for rotation.\n\nLet me try to draw a free-body diagram in my mind. The sphere is on the hill, which is inclined at an angle \u03b8. So, gravity has components:\n\n- Down the hill: mg sin\u03b8\n\n- Perpendicular to the hill: mg cos\u03b8\n\nThe normal force, N, is equal to mg cos\u03b8, assuming no other forces in that direction.\n\nNow, there's friction, Ff. Since there's no slipping, it's static friction. This friction force is acting up the hill, right? Wait, no. Actually, friction acts in a way to oppose relative motion between the surfaces. Since the sphere wants to slide down, friction would act up the hill to prevent sliding and to make it roll instead.\n\nSo, friction is acting up the hill, and its magnitude is less than or equal to \u03bcs N, where \u03bcs is the coefficient of static friction.\n\nNow, the torque is caused by this friction force. The torque \u03c4 = r \u00d7 F, where r is the radius and F is the force. In this case, the force is the friction force, Ff, acting at the point of contact, which is at the bottom of the sphere.\n\nSo, \u03c4 = Ff \u00d7 r, and this torque is causing the sphere to rotate.\n\nAlternatively, gravity has a component down the hill, which also contributes to the torque, but wait, gravity acts through the center of mass, so its line of action passes through the center, and thus it doesn't cause torque about the center.\n\nWait, is that right? Actually, gravity does cause some torque when the sphere is rolling down the hill. Let me think again.\n\nWhen the sphere is rolling down the hill, gravity has a component parallel to the hill, which is mg sin\u03b8. This force acts through the center of mass, and since the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the plane of the hill, passing through the center, gravity does exert a torque about the center.\n\nBut, friction also exerts a torque in the opposite direction. So, the net torque is the difference between these two torques.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in rotational dynamics, the net torque is the sum of all torques about the axis of rotation. So, both gravity and friction exert torques, and the net torque is the sum of their individual torques.\n\nBut in this problem, I need to find out which force provides the torque that causes the sphere to rotate. It's likely that both gravity and friction contribute to the torque, but the question is asking for the primary force that provides the torque.\n\nLet me consider the equations for rolling without slipping. For a sphere rolling down an inclined plane, the torque is given by:\n\n\u03c4 = I \u03b1\n\nwhere I is the moment of inertia about the center of mass, and \u03b1 is the angular acceleration.\n\nThe torque is also equal to the force times the radius, considering the perpendicular distance.\n\nSo, \u03c4 = Ff \u00d7 r\n\nBut gravity also exerts a torque, \u03c4g = (mg sin\u03b8) \u00d7 r, assuming the force is applied at the radius.\n\nWait, actually, the torque due to gravity is (mg sin\u03b8) \u00d7 (r sin\u03b8), because the perpendicular distance is r sin\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, the torque due to friction is Ff \u00d7 r.\n\nSo, the net torque is \u03c4_net = \u03c4_f + \u03c4_g = Ff \u00d7 r + (mg sin\u03b8) \u00d7 (r sin\u03b8)\n\nBut in rolling without slipping, the sphere's linear acceleration a and angular acceleration \u03b1 are related by a = r \u03b1.\n\nAlso, the forces in the direction of the hill are:\n\nmg sin\u03b8 - Ff = m a\n\nAnd torque is \u03c4 = I \u03b1\n\nSo, combining these, we have:\n\nFf \u00d7 r = I \u03b1\n\nBut a = r \u03b1, so \u03b1 = a / r\n\nThus, Ff \u00d7 r = I (a / r)\n\nWhich simplifies to Ff = (I / r^2) a\n\nBut from the linear equation: mg sin\u03b8 - Ff = m a\n\nSubstituting Ff from above:\n\nmg sin\u03b8 - (I / r^2) a = m a\n\nSo, a (m + I / r^2) = mg sin\u03b8\n\nTherefore, a = (mg sin\u03b8) / (m + I / r^2)\n\nFor a solid sphere, I = (2/5) m r^2\n\nSo, a = (mg sin\u03b8) / (m + (2/5) m) = (mg sin\u03b8) / (7/5 m) = (5/7) g sin\u03b8\n\nNow, the torque is \u03c4 = I \u03b1 = (2/5 m r^2) \u00d7 (a / r) = (2/5 m r a)\n\nBut a = (5/7) g sin\u03b8, so \u03c4 = (2/5 m r) \u00d7 ((5/7) g sin\u03b8 / r) = (2/5 m r) \u00d7 (5/7 g sin\u03b8 / r) = (2/7) m g sin\u03b8\n\nBut I'm getting too deep into the calculations. The question is, what force provides the torque that causes the sphere to rotate?\n\nFrom the earlier analysis, both gravity and friction provide torques, but perhaps one dominates or is more directly responsible.\n\nLet me consider that if there were no friction, the sphere would still have a torque due to gravity, which would cause it to roll, but it might slip as well. However, in the presence of friction, friction provides the necessary torque to make the sphere roll without slipping.\n\nSo, friction is essential for pure rolling motion. Therefore, it's likely that friction is the primary force providing the torque that causes rotation.\n\nAlternatively, considering that gravity is pulling the sphere down the hill, and friction is opposing the motion, the torque due to friction is what's causing the rotation in the direction that helps the sphere roll without slipping.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be static friction.\n\nWait, but the problem includes options for kinetic friction. If the sphere is rolling without slipping, it's static friction, not kinetic friction.\n\nSo, option A is static friction, option B is kinetic friction, option C is the normal force, and option D is gravity.\n\nGiven this analysis, I think the answer is static friction.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider if the normal force could provide torque. The normal force is perpendicular to the hill, and its line of action passes through the axis of rotation, so it doesn't cause torque.\n\nGravity does cause some torque, but as discussed earlier, friction is necessary to provide the torque for rolling without slipping.\n\nTherefore, the primary force providing the torque for rotation is static friction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Static friction}} \\]"
