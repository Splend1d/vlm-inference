                    "text": "So my neighbor is telling me about his home repair contract and how he thinks it should be discharged due to \"frustration of purpose.\" He's asking about the requirements for this to happen, and there's a question with options A through D. I need to figure out which one isn't required for frustration of purpose to discharge a contract.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"frustration of purpose\" means in contract law. From what I recall, it's a doctrine that allows a party to be released from their obligations under a contract when an unforeseen event occurs after the contract is formed, making the contract's performance significantly different or worthless to the purpose for which it was made.\n\nSo, let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A: A supervening event.\n\nThis sounds right because frustration of purpose requires that something happens after the contract is formed which changes the circumstances significantly. So, a supervening event is necessary for frustration of purpose to apply.\n\nOption B: That was reasonably foreseeable at the time of contract formation.\n\nWait a minute, I think frustration of purpose involves events that are not foreseeable. If an event was foreseeable, the parties should have accounted for it in the contract terms or taken steps to mitigate its impact. So, I believe the event should not be reasonably foreseeable at the time of contract formation. Therefore, this option seems contradictory.\n\nOption C: Which completely or almost completely destroys the purpose of the contract.\n\nThis makes sense because if the purpose of the contract is only partially frustrated, it might not be enough to discharge the contract. The frustration needs to be substantial, effectively rendering the contract's performance meaningless or valueless to the party seeking discharge.\n\nOption D: The purpose of the contract was understood by both parties.\n\nThis seems important because for a contract to be discharged due to frustration of purpose, both parties must have shared the same purpose or objective in entering into the contract. If only one party had a particular purpose in mind that the other wasn't aware of, it might not qualify for frustration of purpose.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option B seems to be incorrect because frustration of purpose involves unforeseeable events, not foreseeable ones.\n\nBut let me double-check. Suppose there's a home repair contract to fix a roof, and after the contract is signed, there's a natural disaster that destroys the house. That would be an unforeseeable event that frustrates the purpose of the contract, which was to repair the roof of an existing house. If the disaster was foreseeable, like if the area is prone to earthquakes and both parties knew it, they might have included provisions in the contract to account for such events.\n\nTherefore, the event should not be reasonably foreseeable for frustration of purpose to apply. So, option B is incorrect because it states that the event was reasonably foreseeable, which would contradict the requirement for frustration of purpose.\n\nI think that's the answer: option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
