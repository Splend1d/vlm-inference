                    "text": "So I've got this property law problem here, and I need to figure out who should win this case between the mining company and the buyer over the use of a pathway on the timberland. Let me try to understand the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a doctor who owns 1,500 acres of undeveloped timberland. In September 1989, the doctor sells the land to a dentist via a warranty deed, and the dentist records it right away. Then, in April 1990, the dentist sells the same tract to a buyer, also by warranty deed, and the buyer records it immediately. So, the buyer is the current owner of the land.\n\nNow, there's a mining company that has been using a pathway on this land since 1986. They have an agreement with the doctor from 1986 that allows them to use this pathway as a road in exchange for $700 per annum. This agreement was duly recorded, which probably means it's on the public record.\n\nIn 1990, after the buyer has purchased the land from the dentist, the buyer tells the mining company that he won't honor the 1986 agreement and they can't use the pathway anymore. The mining company sues for specific performance, meaning they want the court to enforce their right to use the pathway.\n\nThe question is, who should win this case: the mining company or the buyer?\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. The mining company, because their property interest would \"run with the land.\"\n\nB. The mining company, because the possessor of a servient interest would prevail against subsequent owners.\n\nC. The buyer, because the mining company's interest was extinguished by the subsequent conveyance.\n\nD. The buyer, because there was no privity of estate between the buyer and the mining company.\n\nOkay, I need to understand what kind of interest the mining company has in the pathway. The agreement says they can use the pathway perpetually in exchange for $700 per annum. That sounds like an easement, which is a right to use someone else's land for a specific purpose.\n\nAn easement is a type of property interest that can \"run with the land,\" meaning it can bind subsequent owners of the land. But for that to happen, certain conditions must be met.\n\nFirst, was this easement appurtenant or in gross? An easement appurtenant is typically associated with another piece of land, benefiting that land. An easement in gross is more personal and isn't necessarily tied to another piece of land.\n\nIn this case, the mining company is using the pathway to access their own operations, so it might be an easement in gross. But sometimes easements in gross can be terminated if the dominant estate is sold or transferred.\n\nWait, but the agreement says \"the parties expressly agree and the doctor promises that the doctor and his successors shall refrain from obstructing the said described pathway across the doctor's land, which the mining company and its successors may perpetually use as a road.\"\n\nSo, it seems like the doctor granted the mining company the right to use the pathway perpetually, and the doctor and successors agree not to obstruct it.\n\nThis sounds like a covenant running with the land or perhaps an easement by deed.\n\nGiven that it's recorded, it's on the public record, so subsequent purchasers should be aware of it.\n\nNow, the buyer is claiming that the mining company's interest is extinguished by the subsequent conveyance or that there's no privity of estate.\n\nPrivity of estate refers to a direct relationship between parties who have an interest in the same property. So, if the buyer is arguing there's no privity of estate between them and the mining company, that might be relevant to whether the easement binds them.\n\nBut in property law, easements and covenants can run with the land and bind subsequent owners, even if there's no privity of estate between the original parties.\n\nSo, if the easement was properly created and recorded, it should bind the buyer as a subsequent owner.\n\nOption A says the mining company wins because their property interest runs with the land. That seems plausible.\n\nOption B says the mining company wins because the possessor of a servient interest prevails against subsequent owners. Hmm, the servient estate is the land over which the easement runs, which is the timberland. The dominant estate is the mining company's land, which benefits from the easement.\n\nI'm a bit confused here. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nOption C says the buyer wins because the mining company's interest was extinguished by the subsequent conveyance. But generally, easements don't just extinguish because the land was sold. There are specific ways easements can be terminated, like by release, abandonment, merger, or prescription, but none of those seem to apply here.\n\nOption D says the buyer wins because there's no privity of estate between the buyer and the mining company. But as I thought earlier, easements can bind subsequent owners without privity of estate.\n\nLet me think about the doctrine of notice. Since the agreement was recorded, any subsequent purchaser would have constructive notice of it. So, the buyer, even though they bought after the agreement was in place, should still be bound by it because it's on the public record.\n\nTherefore, the mining company should be able to enforce the easement against the buyer.\n\nWait, but the buyer paid full market value and recorded the deed immediately. Does that affect anything?\n\nProbably not, because the easement was already recorded before the buyer purchased the land.\n\nSo, the buyer should be bound by the easement.\n\nTherefore, the mining company should win this case.\n\nLooking back at the options, A seems to be the correct answer: the mining company wins because their property interest runs with the land.\n\nOption B might be a bit confusing, but I think A is more straightforward.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the easement isn't extinguished by the conveyance.\n\nOption D is incorrect because easements can bind subsequent owners without privity of estate, especially if they're recorded.\n\nSo, I think A is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
