                    "text": "So I have this problem here: there are 85 teachers on staff, and the principal needs to select three different teachers to speak at the graduation ceremony. One will be the opener, one the name-reader, and one the closer. I need to figure out how many possible speaking lineups the principal can have.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have 85 teachers, and we need to choose 3 different ones, and assign them specific roles: opener, name-reader, and closer. So, the order in which we choose them matters because each position is distinct.\n\nThis sounds like a permutation problem because the order matters. Permutation is when we're arranging items where the sequence is important. The formula for permutations when choosing r items from a set of n items is:\n\n\\[ P(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{(n - r)!} \\]\n\nHere, n is 85 and r is 3.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ P(85, 3) = \\frac{85!}{(85 - 3)!} = \\frac{85!}{82!} \\]\n\nNow, calculating 85 factorial divided by 82 factorial. I know that:\n\n\\[ 85! = 85 \\times 84 \\times 83 \\times 82! \\]\n\nSo, when I divide by 82!, I'm left with:\n\n\\[ 85 \\times 84 \\times 83 \\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate that product.\n\nFirst, calculate 85 times 84.\n\n\\[ 85 \\times 84 = 7140 \\]\n\nThen, multiply that result by 83.\n\n\\[ 7140 \\times 83 \\]\n\nHmm, that might be a bit tedious to calculate by hand. Let me see if I can make it easier.\n\nI can break it down:\n\n83 can be thought of as 80 + 3.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ 7140 \\times 83 = 7140 \\times (80 + 3) = 7140 \\times 80 + 7140 \\times 3 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate 7140 times 80.\n\n\\[ 7140 \\times 80 = 571,200 \\]\n\nThen, calculate 7140 times 3.\n\n\\[ 7140 \\times 3 = 21,420 \\]\n\nNow, add those together.\n\n\\[ 571,200 + 21,420 = 592,620 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of possible speaking lineups is 592,620.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 592,620\n\nB. 592,704\n\nC. 614,125\n\nD. 614,126\n\nIt seems like option A is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as choosing the opener first, then the name-reader, then the closer, with no teacher being chosen for more than one role.\n\nSo, for the opener, there are 85 choices.\n\nOnce the opener is chosen, there are 84 teachers left for the name-reader.\n\nThen, after choosing the name-reader, there are 83 teachers left for the closer.\n\nSo, the total number of ways is:\n\n\\[ 85 \\times 84 \\times 83 \\]\n\nWhich is the same as before, 592,620.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider selecting all three at once without assigning roles first, and then assigning the roles.\n\nFirst, choose 3 teachers out of 85, which is combinations:\n\n\\[ C(85, 3) = \\frac{85!}{3!(85 - 3)!} = \\frac{85!}{3! \\times 82!} \\]\n\nThen, assign the roles, which is 3 factorial (3!) ways to assign the roles to the three teachers.\n\nSo, total ways:\n\n\\[ C(85, 3) \\times 3! = \\frac{85!}{3! \\times 82!} \\times 3! = \\frac{85!}{82!} \\]\n\nAgain, this brings me back to the same calculation:\n\n\\[ 85 \\times 84 \\times 83 = 592,620 \\]\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I end up with the same result.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 592,620, which is option A.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this.\n\nIs there any possibility of teachers refusing to speak, or any constraints on who can be assigned to which role? The problem doesn't mention any such constraints, so I assume that all teachers are eligible for any of the three roles.\n\nAlso, it's specified that the teachers must be different, so no teacher can take on multiple roles.\n\nAnother way to look at it is using the fundamental counting principle, which states that if there are m ways to do one thing, and n ways to do another, then there are m \u00d7 n ways to do both.\n\nApplying this:\n\n- 85 choices for the opener.\n\n- Once the opener is chosen, 84 choices for the name-reader.\n\n- After choosing both, 83 choices for the closer.\n\nAgain, multiplying them gives 85 \u00d7 84 \u00d7 83 = 592,620.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and each method confirms the initial answer.\n\nSo, the final answer is 592,620.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{592,620} \\]"
