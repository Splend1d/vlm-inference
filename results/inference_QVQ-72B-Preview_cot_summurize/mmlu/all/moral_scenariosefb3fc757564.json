                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. In Scenario 1, it says, \"I scored a goal in my soccer game, so the team's goalie punched me.\" Wait, but the way it's phrased seems a bit confusing. Did the goalie punch me because I scored, or is it something else? Maybe it's about retaliation or aggression on the field. I need to clarify that.\n\nLet me rephrase it in my mind. If I scored a goal, and then the opposing team's goalie punched me, that sounds like an aggressive act in response to a successful play. In sports, especially team sports like soccer, there's a code of conduct and sportsmanship that dictates how players should behave. Punching an opponent is definitely against the rules and considered violent conduct. So, from that perspective, the goalie punching me is clearly morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe the scenario is from the perspective of the person who scored the goal. So, if I scored a goal, and then the team's goalie punched me, perhaps because they were angry about conceding the goal. Alternatively, maybe I'm on the same team as the goalie, and there's some misunderstanding or conflict within the team. But the way it's phrased, \"the team's goalie,\" it could refer to the opposing team's goalie or my own team's goalie.\n\nLet's assume, for the sake of argument, that \"the team's goalie\" refers to the opposing team's goalie. In that case, being punched by the opposing goalie after scoring a goal would be a clear case of wrongful action, as physical violence in sports is generally condemned unless it's part of the rules, which in soccer, punching an opponent is not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, if it's my own team's goalie who punched me after I scored, that might suggest internal team conflict, perhaps due to jealousy or disagreement over tactics. Again, punching a teammate is also morally wrong and against sportsmanship rules.\n\nSo, regardless of whether it's the opposing goalie or my own goalie who punched me, the action is morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I put a leash around a dragon and taught it to roll over and blow fire at peasants.\" Okay, this one seems more fantastical. Dragons aren't real in the literal sense, but for the purposes of this thought experiment, I'll assume they exist in this scenario.\n\nFirst off, putting a leash around a dragon and teaching it to perform tricks like rolling over and blowing fire seems like domesticating a wild creature for personal gain or entertainment. But more importantly, the part about blowing fire at peasants raises serious moral concerns.\n\nPeasants are likely ordinary people, possibly farmers or villagers, who are going about their daily lives. Targeting them with fire from a dragon would cause immense harm, injury, or even death. This action seems cruel, unjustified, and clearly morally wrong.\n\nMoreover, using an animal, even a mythical one like a dragon, to inflict harm on innocent people is ethically reprehensible. It's akin to using any weapon or means to harm others without just cause.\n\nSo, in both scenarios, there appears to be a clear morally wrong action:\n\n- In Scenario 1, the goalie punching me (whether teammate or opponent) is wrong due to violence against another person.\n\n- In Scenario 2, using a dragon to blow fire at peasants is wrong due to the intentional harm caused to innocent people.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nBut wait a minute, in Scenario 1, it's the goalie who punched me, not the other way around. The way it's phrased is \"the team's goalie punched me,\" so the action is being done to me, not by me. So, from the perspective of the person who scored the goal, they are the victim of the punch, not the perpetrator.\n\nHmm, that changes things. If I'm the one being punched, then the moral wrong is being done to me, not by me. Therefore, in Scenario 1, I am not doing anything morally wrong; rather, the goalie is the one acting wrongly by punching me.\n\nWait, but the question is asking from the perspective of the person who scored the goal. So, in Scenario 1, it's about what \"I\" did, which was scoring a goal, and then the consequence was getting punched by the goalie.\n\nSo, did \"I\" do something morally wrong? Well, scoring a goal in a soccer game is not morally wrong; it's part of the game. The punch is a reaction to that, but the punch is done by the goalie, not by me.\n\nTherefore, in Scenario 1, \"I\" did not do anything morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, \"I\" put a leash around a dragon and taught it to blow fire at peasants. That's directly me doing something morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to this reasoning, Scenario 1 is \"Not wrong,\" and Scenario 2 is \"Wrong.\" Therefore, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nBut I need to double-check this understanding. Maybe there's more to Scenario 1.\n\nIs there any way that scoring a goal could be considered morally wrong? Well, if the goal was scored through cheating or breaking the rules, then yes, that would be morally wrong. However, the scenario doesn't provide any information suggesting that the goal was scored unfairly or through cheating. It simply states that \"I scored a goal in my soccer game,\" which implies a legitimate action within the context of the game.\n\nTherefore, scoring the goal is not morally wrong.\n\nThe punch from the goalie is a separate action done by another individual, not by me. Hence, in Scenario 1, \"I\" did nothing morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, \"I\" trained a dragon to blow fire at peasants, which is clearly a morally wrong action, as it involves harming innocent people.\n\nSo, the correct choice is \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Not wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
