                    "text": "So I've got this problem about topological spaces and some properties like connectedness, compactness, and being Hausdorff. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nWe have a topological space X, and three nonempty subsets A, B, and C of X such that A \u2282 B \u2282 C, where \u2282 means proper subset. So, A is properly contained in B, and B is properly contained in C.\n\nThe question is asking which of the statements I, II, or III are true.\n\nLet's look at each one:\n\nI. If A and C are connected, then B is connected.\n\nHmm, connectedness is a property of topological spaces where you can't split the space into two nonempty open sets that are separated. So, if A and C are connected, does that mean B is connected?\n\nI need to think about this. Maybe consider some examples.\n\nSuppose X is the real line R, with the usual topology. Let's pick A to be an interval, say A = [0,1], which is connected. Let C be another interval, say C = [0,2], which is also connected. Now, B needs to be a subset of C that contains A, but not equal to C. So, maybe B = [0,1.5). Is B connected?\n\nWait, [0,1.5) is an interval, so it should be connected in the subspace topology of R. So, in this case, B is connected.\n\nBut maybe I need a different example where B isn't connected.\n\nWhat if A is [0,1], C is [0,2], and B is [0,1) \u222a (1,2]? So, B is C minus A, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, B needs to contain A, which is [0,1].\n\nLet me try B = [0,1) \u222a (1,2]. So, B contains A = [0,1], since [0,1) is in B. But B is not equal to C = [0,2], since C includes 2, but B doesn't.\n\nNow, B = [0,1) \u222a (1,2], which is the union of two open intervals. Is B connected?\n\nWell, in R with the usual topology, [0,1) and (1,2] are both open in the subspace topology of B. And they are disjoint, nonempty, and open in B, so B can be written as the union of these two open sets, which are separated. Therefore, B is not connected.\n\nBut in this case, A and C are connected, but B is not. So, statement I is not necessarily true.\n\nWait, but maybe there are conditions under which I is true. But based on this counterexample, it seems that I is not always true.\n\nSo, I think I is false.\n\nII. If A and C are compact, then B is compact.\n\nCompactness is a stronger property. In a topological space, a set is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover.\n\nNow, C is compact, and B is a subset of C. Since C is compact, any closed subset of C is also compact. But B is not necessarily closed in C.\n\nWait, in general, if C is compact and B is a subset of C, then B is compact if and only if B is closed in C. But B is not necessarily closed in C.\n\nLet me think of an example.\n\nAgain, take X = R with the usual topology. Let C = [0,1], which is compact. Let A = [0,1/2], which is also compact. Now, B needs to be a subset of C that contains A, but not equal to C. So, maybe B = [0,1/2] \u222a {3/4}. Is B compact?\n\nWell, B is the union of [0,1/2] and the singleton {3/4}. Both of these are compact, but their union is not necessarily compact. Wait, actually, the union of finitely many compact sets is compact. So, in this case, B is compact.\n\nBut maybe I need a different example where B is not compact.\n\nWhat if C = [0,1], which is compact, A = [0,1/2], which is compact, and B = [0,1/2) \u222a (1/2,1]? So, B is a subset of C that contains A, but not equal to C.\n\nIs B compact? Well, B is the union of [0,1/2) and (1/2,1], both of which are closed and bounded in R, so they are compact. And the union of finitely many compact sets is compact. So, B is compact.\n\nHmm, maybe in this case, B is always compact if A and C are compact.\n\nWait, but is that always true?\n\nSuppose C is compact, and A is compact, and A \u2282 B \u2282 C. Is B necessarily compact?\n\nIn general, yes, because in a Hausdorff space, compact subsets are closed, and the intersection of two compact sets is compact. But wait, this seems a bit fuzzy.\n\nLet me recall that in any topological space, if C is compact and B is closed in C, then B is compact. But in this case, B is not necessarily closed in C.\n\nWait, but A is compact and A \u2282 B \u2282 C. Does that imply anything about B?\n\nActually, no. For example, in R with the usual topology, if C = [0,1], which is compact, and A = {0}, which is compact, and B = [0,1), then B is not compact.\n\nBut wait, in this case, A is not a proper subset of B, because A = B. Wait, no, A is {0}, and B is [0,1), so A \u2282 B, but A \u2260 B.\n\nWait, {0} \u2282 [0,1), and [0,1) \u2282 [0,1]. So, A = {0}, B = [0,1), C = [0,1].\n\nHere, A and C are compact, but B is not compact.\n\nSo, this is a counterexample where A and C are compact, but B is not compact.\n\nTherefore, statement II is false.\n\nIII. If A and C are Hausdorff, then B is Hausdorff.\n\nA Hausdorff space is one where for any two distinct points, there exist disjoint open sets containing each point.\n\nNow, A and C are subsets of X, each with the subspace topology inherited from X.\n\nIf A and C are Hausdorff, does that imply that B, being a subset of C, is also Hausdorff?\n\nWell, in the subspace topology, if X is Hausdorff, then any subspace is also Hausdorff.\n\nBut here, it's not given that X is Hausdorff, only that A and C are Hausdorff as subspaces.\n\nWait, but if A and C are Hausdorff, does that force B to be Hausdorff?\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nSuppose X is not Hausdorff. Then, there exist two points in X that cannot be separated by disjoint open sets.\n\nBut A and C are Hausdorff, meaning that in the subspace topologies of A and C, any two distinct points can be separated.\n\nBut B is a subspace of C, so if C is Hausdorff, then any subspace of C should also be Hausdorff.\n\nWait, is that true?\n\nActually, no. In general, a subspace of a Hausdorff space is Hausdorff.\n\nBecause if C is Hausdorff, and B is a subspace of C, then for any two distinct points in B, viewed as points in C, they can be separated by open sets in C, and these open sets restricted to B will still separate them in B.\n\nTherefore, if C is Hausdorff, then any subspace B of C is also Hausdorff.\n\nSimilarly, since A is a subspace of B, and B is a subspace of C, and A is Hausdorff, but we already have that C being Hausdorff implies B is Hausdorff.\n\nSo, it seems that if A and C are Hausdorff, then B, being a subspace of C, is indeed Hausdorff.\n\nWait, but is it necessary that C is Hausdorff if A is Hausdorff?\n\nActually, no. Because A is a subspace of B, and B is a subspace of C, but A being Hausdorff doesn't directly imply that C is Hausdorff.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider that if C is Hausdorff, then any subspace of C, including B, is Hausdorff. But it's given that A is Hausdorff, and C is Hausdorff, so B, being a subspace of C, is indeed Hausdorff.\n\nIs there any way that A and C are Hausdorff, but B is not?\n\nWait, perhaps if X is not Hausdorff, but A and C are chosen in such a way that they are Hausdorff subspaces.\n\nBut in that case, since B is a subspace of C, and C is Hausdorff, B should still be Hausdorff.\n\nI think I cannot construct a counterexample where A and C are Hausdorff, but B is not.\n\nTherefore, statement III is true.\n\nSo, among the three statements, only III is true.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. I and II only\n\nB. III only\n\nC. I and III only\n\nD. I, II, and III\n\nThe correct answer should be B. III only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
