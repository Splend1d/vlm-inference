                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what Maxwell Smart's code name is in the original 'Get Smart' TV series. I've got a few options here: Agent 86, Agent 99, Larrabee, or The Chief. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that 'Get Smart' is a comedy TV show from the 1960s, right? It's like a humorous take on spy shows that were popular back then. Maxwell Smart is the main character, played by Don Adams. He's kind of bumbling but somehow manages to save the day.\n\nNow, I remember that in the show, Maxwell Smart has a code name, just like in any spy organization. Let me think about this. I recall that in some episodes, he's referred to as Agent 86. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check that.\n\nI think the number 86 is significant in the show. Maybe it's his agent number. But I also remember that in later versions or spin-offs, there might be references to other numbers, but I'm not sure.\n\nOption B is Agent 99. I know that Agent 99 was another character in the show, played by Barbara Feldon. She was Maxwell Smart's partner. So, if Agent 99 is a different character, then maybe Maxwell Smart is Agent 86. That seems logical.\n\nThen there's Larrabee and The Chief. I think The Chief is the head of the CONTROL agency, which is the organization that Maxwell Smart and Agent 99 work for. And Larrabee might be another character, maybe a rival or someone else in the agency.\n\nSo, based on that, I would guess that Maxwell Smart's code name is Agent 86. That seems to make sense because he's the main agent, and Agent 99 is his partner.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any other information that could help me confirm this. Perhaps I should think about the show's famous catchphrase or some iconic moments.\n\nOh, I remember that Maxwell Smart had this phone in his shoe that he used to communicate. That was pretty funny. But I don't think that directly relates to his code name.\n\nLet me try recalling if there were any references to other agent numbers in the show. Was there an Agent 13 or something like that? No, I think that might be from another show. Wait, in 'Get Smart', I think there was an Agent 13, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nActually, now that I think about it, in the show, agents had numbers like 86 and 99, so it seems consistent that Maxwell Smart would be Agent 86 and his partner would be Agent 99.\n\nAnother thing I recall is that in one episode, Maxwell Smart was promoted to a higher position, maybe temporary, but I think his agent number stayed the same.\n\nAlso, I think the number 86 might have some significance beyond just being his agent number. Maybe it's a reference to something else, but I can't remember what that would be.\n\nLet me see if I can recall any dialogue from the show that might confirm his code name. Oh, I remember a scene where he answers his shoe phone and says, \"This is Agent 86 speaking.\" Yeah, that sounds familiar.\n\nSo, that seems to confirm it. Maxwell Smart is indeed Agent 86.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any possibility that his code name changes throughout the series or if there's any confusion about it. But I don't think so. I believe he consistently goes by Agent 86.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Agent 86.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Agent 86}} \\]"
