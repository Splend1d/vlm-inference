He sent it in response to an ad for new ideas in an industry publication. He discussed it with the producer's assistant in a phone call, and mentioned his expectation of compensation. She said, \"Well, of course, we always pay for a writer's work.\" She said she would go over it with her boss to see if he liked it. Several months later, the writer saw a casting call for a new series. The plot and characters were nearly identical to those described in his synopsis. He sued the producer for breach of contract. The producer defended by arguing that there was no contract. What is the likely ruling of the court?\n\nA. The court will rule that there is an express contract because there was a meeting of the mind and mutual assent to the basic terms.\nB. The court will rule that there was an implied in fact contract between the parties based on the conduct that they manifested.\nC. The court will rule that there was no consideration specifically mentioned and under those circumstances, the law viewed the synopsis as a gift to the producer.\nD. There were too many terms left out for this to be a contract, and it was too indefinite for the court to imply what the terms might have been.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a writer who sent a synopsis to a Hollywood producer, and then the writer saw a similar show being made and sued for breach of contract. The producer claims there was no contract. I need to figure out what the court is likely to rule based on the options given.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The writer responded to an ad for new ideas and sent a four-page synopsis to the producer. He had a phone call with the producer's assistant, mentioned his expectation of compensation, and the assistant said they always pay for a writer's work. Then, months later, he saw a casting call for a new series that was similar to his synopsis, so he sued for breach of contract.\n\nNow, the producer is defending by saying there was no contract. The options are:\n\nA. There is an express contract because there was a meeting of the minds and mutual assent to the basic terms.\n\nB. There was an implied in fact contract based on the conduct of the parties.\n\nC. There was no consideration specifically mentioned, and thus the synopsis is considered a gift.\n\nD. The terms were too indefinite for a contract to be formed.\n\nI need to think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: express contract. An express contract is one where the terms are clearly stated and agreed upon by both parties. In this case, did the writer and the producer clearly state and agree to the terms of payment for the synopsis?\n\nWell, the writer mentioned his expectation of compensation, and the assistant said, \"Well, of course, we always pay for a writer's work.\" Does this constitute a clear agreement on terms? It seems a bit vague. The assistant said they always pay, but what exactly are the terms? How much? Under what conditions? It's not entirely clear.\n\nSo, maybe option A isn't the strongest choice.\n\nOption B: implied in fact contract based on the conduct of the parties. This seems interesting. An implied contract is one where the actions of the parties suggest an agreement, even if there aren't explicit terms. In this scenario, the writer submitted a synopsis in response to an ad, had a conversation with the assistant about payment, and then the producer used the idea for a show.\n\nThe conduct here seems to suggest that there was an understanding or expectation of payment for the idea. The writer expected payment, and the assistant confirmed that they pay for writers' work. So, perhaps the court could infer that there was an implied contract based on their actions.\n\nBut, I need to consider if there's enough to establish an implied contract. Was there consideration? The writer provided the synopsis, which had value, and the producer used it for a show. The producer, through their assistant, indicated an expectation of payment. So, maybe there is enough here to imply a contract.\n\nOption C: no consideration specifically mentioned, so the synopsis is a gift. Consideration refers to something of value exchanged between parties. In this case, the writer provided the synopsis, which is a valuable asset, and the producer potentially used it for profit.\n\nHowever, the writer expressed an expectation of payment, and the assistant acknowledged that they pay for writers' work. So, it seems like the writer didn't intend to give the synopsis as a gift. Therefore, this option doesn't seem likely.\n\nOption D: terms were too indefinite for a contract to be formed. While it's true that the exact terms of payment weren't specified, the fact that both parties discussed payment suggests that there was an understanding of some sort of payment.\n\nBut, the court might have to imply the terms based on industry standards or other evidence. It's possible that in the entertainment industry, there are standard rates for synopses or ideas. So, perhaps the court could imply the terms based on that.\n\nHowever, considering that the assistant said they always pay for a writer's work, it indicates that there is a general practice of payment, which could be sufficient to imply a contract.\n\nBetween options A, B, and D, option B seems the most fitting. The conduct of the parties\u2014writer submitting the synopsis in response to an ad, discussing payment, and the producer using the idea\u2014suggests that there was an implied in fact contract.\n\nOption A is less clear because the terms weren't explicitly stated. Option D suggests that the terms were too indefinite, but the assistant's statement implies some form of payment is expected and provided.\n\nTherefore, I think the likely ruling of the court is option B: there was an implied in fact contract based on the conduct that they manifested.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
