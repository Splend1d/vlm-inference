                    "text": " So I'm trying to understand this argument by Patrick Lee and Robert George about human embryos being complete human beings. The options are:\n\nA. They are complete organisms that are genetically human.\n\nB. Unlike cells of the mother or father, their growth is directed toward survival and maturation.\n\nC. Both A and B.\n\nD. Neither A nor B.\n\nI need to figure out which of these statements aligns with their argument.\n\nFirst, let's break down what they might mean by \"complete human beings.\" I think they're arguing that from the moment of conception, an embryo is not just any cell, but it's a distinct human organism with its own genetic makeup and developmental path.\n\nOption A says they are complete organisms that are genetically human. So, this seems to suggest that embryos have a unique genetic code that defines them as human, separate from the mother or father.\n\nOption B says that unlike cells of the mother or father, their growth is directed toward survival and maturation. This seems to imply that embryos have an intrinsic drive to develop into fully formed humans, which is different from other cells in the parent's bodies that may not have the same developmental potential.\n\nNow, I need to see if both of these points are part of Lee and George's argument or just one of them.\n\nLet me think about it. If they argue that embryos are complete human beings because they are genetically human and because their growth is directed toward survival and maturation, then both A and B would be correct. But I need to make sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider the context. Embryos do have their own unique genome combining DNA from both parents, which makes them genetically distinct from the mother and father. So, that supports option A.\n\nAs for option B, embryos do have a developmental program that, under normal circumstances, leads them to develop into full-term babies. This is different from, say, skin cells in the mother or sperm cells in the father, which don't have the same developmental potential once they've differentiated.\n\nBut wait, sperm cells are actually totipotent\u2014they have the potential to develop into a complete organism if they fertilize an egg. So, maybe option B isn't as clear-cut. Sperm cells, before fertilization, are still capable of contributing to the development of an embryo if they successfully fertilize an egg.\n\nHowever, once the embryo is formed, its development is indeed directed toward survival and maturation, whereas sperm cells outside of fertilization don't have that same directed development.\n\nSimilarly, eggs are also capable of developing into an embryo upon fertilization. So, perhaps option B is trying to say that embryos have already initiated a developmental program that is specifically human and directed toward maturation, which is distinct from other cells like sperm or eggs that haven't yet initiated that program.\n\nBut actually, embryos have initiated that developmental program, whereas sperm and eggs haven't yet. So, in that sense, option B makes sense.\n\nTherefore, both A and B seem to be valid reasons for considering embryos as complete human beings according to Lee and George.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's more to it. Perhaps they have other reasons beyond just genetics and developmental potential.\n\nLet me see if I can recall any specific arguments they've made. I remember that Lee and George are known for their views on natural law and the intrinsic value of human life from conception onward. They argue that human life begins at conception and that the embryo is a member of the human species with inherent dignity and rights.\n\nGiven that, options A and B both support the idea that embryos are distinct human organisms with their own developmental potential.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are other aspects to their argument that aren't covered by A or B.\n\nFor example, they might also argue based on the embryo's capacity for rationality or consciousness, but those aren't mentioned here.\n\nOr perhaps they consider the embryo's membership in the human species, which would align with option A about being genetically human.\n\nAlternatively, they might argue based on the embryo's potential to develop into a rational being, which is implied by option B's reference to growth directed toward survival and maturation.\n\nGiven that, it seems that both A and B are parts of their argument.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"human embryos are complete human beings because...,\" and the options are A and B. If both are parts of their argument, then the correct answer should be C, both A and B.\n\nBut maybe there's a reason why only one of them is correct. Let me think critically.\n\nOption A focuses on the genetic makeup, saying they are genetically human. That seems straightforward. Embryos have a unique human genome, so they are indeed human in that sense.\n\nOption B focuses on the direction of their growth, meaning their development is geared toward becoming a mature human being, unlike other cells in the parents' bodies.\n\nBoth of these seem to be valid reasons for considering embryos as complete human beings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the argument relies more on the combination of both factors: having a human genome and having a developmental program that is inherently directed toward human maturation.\n\nIn that case, both A and B are necessary to fully capture the essence of their argument.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C, both A and B.\n\nTo make sure, let's consider if there's any reason to choose D, neither A nor B.\n\nIf I were to choose D, I would need to think that neither of these reasons is sufficient or accurate for considering embryos as complete human beings.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right, because both A and B are well-supported scientifically and philosophically in their argument.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more nuanced argument that neither A nor B fully captures, but given the options provided, C seems the most appropriate choice.\n\nSo, my final answer is C, both A and B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
