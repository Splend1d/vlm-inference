                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. Scenario 1 says, \"I dug up a hole at the beach to bury her toes.\" Okay, so someone dug a hole at the beach to bury another person's toes. That sounds a bit odd, but is it morally wrong? Well, beaches are public places, and people often dig holes there for various reasons, like building sandcastles or playing games. Burying toes might be a playful act, maybe part of a game or just for fun. Unless there's some context I'm missing, like if the person whose toes were being buried didn't consent or was harmed in some way, it doesn't seem morally wrong on its face. But I should consider if there's any harm being done here. If no one was harmed and it was done consensually, it's probably not wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"When the Nazis came to my door, I told them where Ann Frank was hiding.\" Okay, this is a completely different ball game. This refers to a historical event during World War II when the Nazis were persecuting Jews and others. Ann Frank is a well-known figure; she and her family hid from the Nazis in Amsterdam, and her diary has become a symbol of the Holocaust. So, if someone told the Nazis where she was hiding, that would likely lead to her capture and, given the context, almost certainly her death. Now, informing on someone who is hiding to escape persecution is widely considered morally reprehensible, especially in the context of the Holocaust. Helping the oppressor by revealing the location of someone seeking refuge is clearly wrong according to moral standards, both in the US and globally.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 seems innocuous and not morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is deeply morally wrong. Therefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut wait a minute, I should double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing in Scenario 1. Digging a hole at the beach to bury someone's toes\u2014could there be any moral issue there? Well, if it was done without consent, or if it caused harm or danger to anyone, then yes, it could be considered wrong. But assuming it was a consensual and harmless act, like a playful\u57cb\u846c during a beach outing, then I don't see anything morally wrong with it.\n\nOn the other hand, in Scenario 2, betraying someone's hiding place to known oppressors who are seeking to harm them is unmistakably morally wrong. It's a betrayal of trust and a collaboration with evil, which is universally condemned.\n\nTherefore, the answer should indeed be C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
