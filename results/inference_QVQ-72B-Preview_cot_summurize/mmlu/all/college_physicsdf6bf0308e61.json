                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out how much work needs to be done on a particle to accelerate it from rest to 0.6 times the speed of light. The particle has a mass m, and I need to find the work done in terms of mc\u00b2. The options are 0.25mc\u00b2, 0.60mc\u00b2, 0.67mc\u00b2, and 1.25mc\u00b2.\n\nFirst, I remember that in classical mechanics, work is equal to the change in kinetic energy of an object. The formula is W = \u0394K, where \u0394K is the kinetic energy final minus kinetic energy initial. Since the particle starts from rest, the initial kinetic energy is zero.\n\nBut I also recall that at speeds comparable to the speed of light, classical mechanics doesn't hold up anymore, and I need to use relativistic equations. So, the relativistic kinetic energy formula is K = (\u03b3 - 1)mc\u00b2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe Lorentz factor is \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Given that v = 0.6c, I can plug that in:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25.\n\nSo, \u03b3 = 1.25.\n\nNow, the relativistic kinetic energy is K = (\u03b3 - 1)mc\u00b2 = (1.25 - 1)mc\u00b2 = 0.25mc\u00b2.\n\nWait a minute, that would suggest that the work done is 0.25mc\u00b2, which is option A. But I have a feeling that this might not be the complete answer.\n\nLet me think again. In relativity, the total energy of a particle is E = \u03b3mc\u00b2, and the kinetic energy is K = E - mc\u00b2 = (\u03b3 - 1)mc\u00b2.\n\nBut in some contexts, especially in particle physics, the rest energy mc\u00b2 is included in the total energy, and the kinetic energy is the excess above mc\u00b2.\n\nHowever, in the context of work done, I think the work done should be equal to the change in kinetic energy, which is K - 0, since it starts from rest.\n\nBut I'm getting K = 0.25mc\u00b2, which is option A, but I'm suspicious because I feel like I might be missing something.\n\nLet me consider the conservation of energy. The work done should equal the change in energy of the particle. Since the particle starts from rest, its initial total energy is mc\u00b2, and its kinetic energy is zero.\n\nAfter acceleration, its total energy is \u03b3mc\u00b2, and its kinetic energy is (\u03b3 - 1)mc\u00b2.\n\nSo, the work done should be equal to the change in kinetic energy, which is (\u03b3 - 1)mc\u00b2 = 0.25mc\u00b2, as I calculated earlier.\n\nBut maybe I need to consider the total energy change, including the rest energy. However, the rest energy doesn't change; it's always mc\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the relativistic work-energy theorem, which states that the net work done on a particle is equal to its final kinetic energy minus its initial kinetic energy.\n\nGiven that, W = K_final - K_initial = (\u03b3 - 1)mc\u00b2 - 0 = (1.25 - 1)mc\u00b2 = 0.25mc\u00b2.\n\nSo, again, I get 0.25mc\u00b2.\n\nBut let's consider another approach. Maybe I should use the relativistic momentum and the work done in terms of integrating force over distance.\n\nIn special relativity, force is defined as the rate of change of momentum: F = dp/dt.\n\nBut this seems more complicated, and since the problem is about work, which is energy transfer, maybe sticking with energy considerations is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic expression for work done in terms of the particle's energy.\n\nI recall that in relativity, the work done is equal to the change in the particle's relativistic kinetic energy.\n\nSo, again, that brings me back to W = (\u03b3 - 1)mc\u00b2 = 0.25mc\u00b2.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nBut maybe I should check using the concept of rapidity or other relativistic parameters, just to be sure.\n\nRapidity is defined as \u03c9 = tanh\u207b\u00b9(v/c). For v = 0.6c, \u03c9 = tanh\u207b\u00b9(0.6) \u2248 0.693.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that directly helps me find the work done.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the relativistic expression for power, but that seems unnecessary for this problem.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the fact that in relativistic mechanics, the work done is equal to the increase in energy, which includes both the kinetic energy and the rest mass energy.\n\nBut the rest mass energy doesn't change; it's always mc\u00b2.\n\nSo, the work done should only account for the change in kinetic energy.\n\nTherefore, W = \u0394K = (\u03b3 - 1)mc\u00b2 = 0.25mc\u00b2.\n\nThis seems to make sense.\n\nBut let's double-check the Lorentz factor calculation.\n\nGiven v = 0.6c, then \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)\u00b2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, K = (1.25 - 1)mc\u00b2 = 0.25mc\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the work done is 0.25mc\u00b2, which is option A.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.25mc^{2}} \\]"
