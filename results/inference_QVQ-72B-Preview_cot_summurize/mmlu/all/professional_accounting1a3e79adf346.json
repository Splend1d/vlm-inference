                    "text": "Let's tackle this accounting problem. So, Dodd Co. has some available-for-sale debt securities. At December 31, these securities have a cost basis of $24,000 and a fair value of $30,000. The income tax rate is 20%, and I need to figure out how much unrealized gain or loss should be recognized in the income statement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"available-for-sale\" securities mean. I recall that available-for-sale securities are investments that a company plans to hold for a period longer than a year but might sell before they mature, depending on market conditions or other factors. For these types of securities, companies record them at fair value on their balance sheet, and any changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income, not directly in the income statement.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is asking about the amount of unrealized gain or loss to recognize in the income statement. That seems a bit confusing because, under U.S. GAAP, for available-for-sale securities, unrealized gains and losses are typically reported in other comprehensive income, not in the income statement itself.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something here. Let me double-check.\n\nAccording to accounting standards, for available-for-sale securities, the fair value adjustment is indeed recorded in other comprehensive income, which is a component of equity, not in the income statement. Realized gains and losses, which occur when the securities are sold, are recorded in the income statement.\n\nSo, in this scenario, since the securities haven't been sold, there shouldn't be any realized gain or loss to report in the income statement. Instead, the unrealized gain from the increase in fair value from $24,000 to $30,000, which is $6,000, should be recorded in other comprehensive income.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking for the amount to recognize in the income statement. That makes me think that perhaps there's a tax component involved here, given that the income tax rate is provided.\n\nLet me consider the tax implications. If there's an unrealized gain of $6,000, but it's not being recognized in the income statement, there shouldn't be any immediate tax effect. However, since the gain is unrealized, it generally doesn't trigger a tax liability until it's realized upon sale.\n\nBut perhaps there's a deferred tax liability that needs to be considered. Under U.S. GAAP, companies must recognize deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences, such as unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities.\n\nSo, if there's an unrealized gain of $6,000, and the tax rate is 20%, the deferred tax liability would be $6,000 multiplied by 20%, which is $1,200. This deferred tax liability would be recognized in the income statement as a component of income tax expense.\n\nWait, but the question is about unrealized gain or loss in the income statement, not about deferred taxes. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in certain accounting frameworks, unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities are recognized in the income statement after adjusting for taxes. But that doesn't align with my understanding of U.S. GAAP.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this. Maybe the question is trying to test the concept of fair value adjustments and their tax implications.\n\nIf that's the case, then the unrealized gain before tax is $6,000, and after considering the 20% tax rate, the net gain would be $6,000 minus the tax on that gain.\n\nBut since unrealized gains aren't taxable until realized, I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing the concept of other comprehensive income and its components. In that case, the unrealized gain would be reported in other comprehensive income, and the deferred tax liability would be recognized there as well.\n\nBut again, the question specifies the income statement, which typically doesn't include other comprehensive income items directly.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that in some accounting standards, other comprehensive income is included in the income statement. But in U.S. GAAP, other comprehensive income is presented separately from the income statement, either in a separate statement or in the equity section of the balance sheet.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is B. $0, meaning that no unrealized gain or loss should be recognized in the income statement for available-for-sale securities.\n\nBut let's see why the other options might be considered:\n\nA. $6,000 loss: This would imply that there's a loss being recognized, but given that the fair value increased by $6,000, this doesn't seem right.\n\nC. $4,800 gain: This might suggest that the $6,000 gain is being recognized net of tax, but as I said earlier, unrealized gains aren't typically recognized in the income statement for available-for-sale securities.\n\nD. $6,000 gain: This would suggest recognizing the full gain in the income statement, which contradicts U.S. GAAP for available-for-sale securities.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer seems to be B. $0, indicating that no unrealized gain or loss should be recognized in the income statement for available-for-sale securities.\n\nHowever, to ensure I'm not missing something, let me check again.\n\nIn U.S. GAAP, for available-for-sale securities, unrealized gains and losses are indeed recorded in other comprehensive income, not in the income statement. Realized gains and losses, which occur upon sale, are recorded in the income statement.\n\nGiven that, and since the securities haven't been sold, there shouldn't be any realized gain or loss to report in the income statement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. $0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
