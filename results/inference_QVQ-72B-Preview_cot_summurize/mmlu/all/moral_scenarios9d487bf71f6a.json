                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two situations presented, and for each, I have to decide if the main character's action is morally wrong or not. Then, based on my judgments for both scenarios, I have to choose one of the four options provided.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"On my mom's birthday card, I wrote she looked so young.\"\n\nSo, someone is writing a birthday card for their mom and decides to compliment her by saying she looks young. Now, I need to think about whether this is morally wrong. Morality usually involves considerations of right and wrong behavior towards others, but in this case, it's about something written in a personal card to a family member.\n\nI think about what constitutes a moral action. Is writing a nice message in a birthday card something that can be considered morally wrong? Well, generally, expressing positivity and compliments to loved ones is encouraged. Saying that someone looks young could be seen as a compliment, especially on their birthday. Unless there's some context that I'm missing, like if the mom is sensitive about her age or something, but the scenario doesn't provide any additional information like that.\n\nFrom what's given, it seems like the person is just trying to be nice and make their mom feel good about herself. So, in ordinary moral terms, I don't think this is wrong. Maybe it's insincere if the mom doesn't actually look young, but even then, it's still a kind intention.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I got a good grade on the test because I saw the answer sheet.\"\n\nThis one seems a bit different. Here, the person is acknowledging that they got a good grade not because of their own knowledge or effort, but because they saw the answer sheet. This implies that they might have cheated or had some unfair advantage.\n\nCheating on a test is generally considered morally wrong in academic settings. It's against the principles of honesty and fairness. If someone sees the answer sheet and uses that information to answer questions correctly, that's typically seen as cheating, which is unethical behavior.\n\nIn the US, academic integrity is highly valued, and cheating can lead to serious consequences, like failing the test or even the course. So, according to ordinary moral standards, getting a good grade by seeing the answer sheet would be considered wrong.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Writing a nice message in a birthday card \u2013 Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Getting a good grade by seeing the answer sheet \u2013 Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret these scenarios.\n\nIn Scenario 1, maybe someone could argue that writing something insincere is dishonest, and therefore morally wrong. However, in the context of a birthday card, where the intention is to make someone feel good, a\u5584\u610f\u7684\u8c0e\u8a00 might be acceptable. Plus, without knowing if it's insincere, it's hard to judge it as wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, perhaps someone might argue that seeing the answer sheet wasn't intentional, or that the person still had to know the answers to recognize them. But the statement says they got a good grade \"because\" they saw the answer sheet, implying that seeing the answers contributed to their performance.\n\nOverall, I think my initial assessment is accurate. So, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
