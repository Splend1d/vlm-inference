It's been a while since I studied this, but I remember that incorporation has to do with applying the Bill of Rights to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. Let me see which option best describes that.\n\nOption A says that even though the Constitution gives the federal government the power to regulate international trade, states can still boycott goods from countries that use child labor. Hmm, that seems related to the Commerce Clause, but I'm not sure how it directly ties to the doctrine of incorporation. Incorporation is more about protecting individual rights against state governments, not about regulating trade.\n\nOption B talks about the separation of powers: Congress makes laws, the executive branch enforces them, and the Supreme Court decides if they're constitutional. That sounds like it's describing the system of checks and balances, but it doesn't specifically address the doctrine of incorporation. Incorporation is about applying the Bill of Rights to the states, not about the roles of the different branches of government.\n\nOption C mentions the Fifth Amendment's due process clause and how it might provide a legal justification for people who don't want to serve on a jury. While the Fifth Amendment is part of the Bill of Rights, and due process is involved in jury duty, I don't think that directly relates to the doctrine of incorporation. Incorporation is about extending the protections of the Bill of Rights to state governments through the Fourteenth Amendment, not about specific applications like jury service.\n\nOption D seems the most straightforward. It states that the Bill of Rights was originally intended to protect individuals from the federal government, and the Fourteenth Amendment extended most of those rights to protect individuals from state governments as well. That sounds exactly like what the doctrine of incorporation is about. The Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to incorporate many of the Bill of Rights' protections, making them applicable to the states.\n\nLet me double-check. The doctrine of incorporation involves the Supreme Court using the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause to apply portions of the Bill of Rights to the states. So, for example, the First Amendment freedom of speech originally applied only to Congress, but through incorporation, it now applies to state and local governments as well.\n\nGiven that, option D seems to accurately describe the doctrine of incorporation. The other options touch on related concepts but don't directly address the core of incorporation.\n\nI think the best answer is D: The Bill of Rights articulates certain rights in order to protect individuals from the federal government, and the Fourteenth Amendment extends most of those rights to protect individuals from the state governments as well.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
