The numbers are:\n\n- Binary 1100\n\n- Decimal 11\n\n- Hexadecimal D\n\nAnd I need to list them in order from least to greatest. The options are:\n\nA. Binary 1100, Decimal 11, Hexadecimal D\n\nB. Decimal 11, Binary 1100, Hexadecimal D\n\nC. Decimal 11, Hexadecimal D, Binary 1100\n\nD. Hexadecimal D, Decimal 11, Binary 1100\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to convert all these numbers to the same base so I can compare them easily. I think converting them all to decimal would be the easiest way to go.\n\nStarting with binary 1100:\n\nBinary 1100 means 1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 0*2^0.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n2^3 is 8\n\n2^2 is 4\n\n2^1 is 2\n\n2^0 is 1\n\nSo, 1*8 + 1*4 + 0*2 + 0*1 = 8 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 12\n\nSo, binary 1100 is 12 in decimal.\n\nNext, decimal 11 is already in decimal form, so that stays 11.\n\nThen, hexadecimal D.\n\nHexadecimal D is equivalent to 13 in decimal because D represents 13 in hexadecimal.\n\nSo, now I have:\n\n- Binary 1100: 12\n\n- Decimal 11: 11\n\n- Hexadecimal D: 13\n\nNow, I need to order these from least to greatest:\n\n11, 12, 13\n\nSo, the order should be:\n\nDecimal 11, Binary 1100, Hexadecimal D\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Binary 1100, Decimal 11, Hexadecimal D\n\nB. Decimal 11, Binary 1100, Hexadecimal D\n\nC. Decimal 11, Hexadecimal D, Binary 1100\n\nD. Hexadecimal D, Decimal 11, Binary 1100\n\nSo, option B matches the correct order: Decimal 11, Binary 1100, Hexadecimal D.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the conversions.\n\nBinary 1100 to decimal: 1*8 + 1*4 + 0*2 + 0*1 = 8 + 4 = 12. That seems correct.\n\nHexadecimal D is indeed 13 in decimal. That's correct.\n\nDecimal 11 stays as is.\n\nSo, the numbers in decimal are 11, 12, and 13, which ordered from least to greatest is 11, 12, 13.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B.\n\nWait a minute, but option C is Decimal 11, Hexadecimal D, Binary 1100, which would be 11, 13, 12. That's not correct because 12 comes before 13.\n\nOption D is Hexadecimal D, Decimal 11, Binary 1100, which is 13, 11, 12. Not correct.\n\nOption A is Binary 1100, Decimal 11, Hexadecimal D, which is 12, 11, 13. Not correct.\n\nSo, yes, option B is the only correct one.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's another way to interpret the question or if there's any trick here.\n\nThe question is pretty straightforward: list the numbers in order from least to greatest, and the options are given in different orders.\n\nI don't see any trick; it's a direct conversion and ordering problem.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option B: Decimal 11, Binary 1100, Hexadecimal D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
