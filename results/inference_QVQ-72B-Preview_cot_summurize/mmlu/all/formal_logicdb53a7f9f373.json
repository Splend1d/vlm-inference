(\u2200x)(Ax \u2022 Rx)\n\nC. (\u2200x)(Rx \u2283 Ax)\n\nD. (\u2200x)(Rx \u2022 Ax)\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each symbol represents. I think A stands for \"is an artifact,\" and R stands for \"is a robot.\" The \u2200x means \"for all x,\" so it's a universal quantifier.\n\nThe statement \"All robots are artifacts\" means that if something is a robot, then it must be an artifact. So, in logical terms, it's saying that for any x, if x is a robot, then x is an artifact.\n\nIn predicate logic, \"if x is a robot, then x is an artifact\" is represented as Rx \u2283 Ax.\n\nSince this has to be true for all x, we use the universal quantifier \u2200x.\n\nSo, putting it together, it should be (\u2200x)(Rx \u2283 Ax).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. (\u2200x)(Ax \u2228 Rx) \u2013 This is \"for all x, x is an artifact or x is a robot.\" That's different from the original statement.\n\nB. (\u2200x)(Ax \u2022 Rx) \u2013 This is \"for all x, x is an artifact and x is a robot.\" That would mean everything is both an artifact and a robot, which isn't what the original statement says.\n\nC. (\u2200x)(Rx \u2283 Ax) \u2013 This is exactly what I came up with: \"for all x, if x is a robot, then x is an artifact.\"\n\nD. (\u2200x)(Rx \u2022 Ax) \u2013 Again, this says \"for all x, x is a robot and x is an artifact,\" which is similar to option B.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems to be the correct translation of the statement \"All robots are artifacts.\"\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it differently. Maybe there's another way to interpret this.\n\nAnother way to express \"all robots are artifacts\" is \"everything that is a robot is also an artifact.\" In logic, that's still Rx \u2283 Ax.\n\nAlternatively, in predicate logic, we could express it as \u2200x (Rx \u2192 Ax), but I think \u2283 is commonly used for implication.\n\nWait, in some texts, \u2192 is used for implication, and \u2283 is used in others. I believe both are used interchangeably in many contexts.\n\nAlso, sometimes, people might use the equivalent form in terms of disjunction: \u00acRx \u2228 Ax, but that doesn't match any of the options.\n\nSo, sticking to the original thought, option C seems correct.\n\nLet me check if there's any trick here. Maybe considering the domain of discourse. If the domain is all things, then saying all robots are artifacts makes sense as (\u2200x)(Rx \u2283 Ax).\n\nAlternatively, if the domain is already robots, then it might be different, but in that case, it would probably be (\u2200x)(x \u2283 Ax), but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nI think the domain is all things, so option C is appropriate.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider what each option means:\n\nA. (\u2200x)(Ax \u2228 Rx): \"Everything is either an artifact or a robot.\" This is not the same as all robots being artifacts.\n\nB. (\u2200x)(Ax \u2022 Rx): \"Everything is both an artifact and a robot.\" That's stronger than the original statement.\n\nC. (\u2200x)(Rx \u2283 Ax): \"If something is a robot, then it is an artifact.\" This matches the original statement.\n\nD. (\u2200x)(Rx \u2022 Ax): Same as option B, just with different notation, but still meaning everything is both a robot and an artifact.\n\nTherefore, the correct translation is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
