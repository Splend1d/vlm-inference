                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand why the 'capability' approach to justice doesn't agree with Rawls' theory. The question gives a few options, and I need to pick the one that best explains why the capability approach rejects Rawls' theory.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the capability approach and Rawls' theory are all about. I know that John Rawls is famous for his theory of justice, which emphasizes fairness and the idea that we should arrange society to benefit the least advantaged. He talks about a social contract and imagining ourselves behind a \"veil of ignorance\" where we don't know our place in society, to decide on fair principles.\n\nOn the other hand, the capability approach is something developed by economists and philosophers like Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum. It focuses on people's capabilities\u2014that is, what they are able to do and be in life. It's about having real opportunities to live a good life, not just having certain resources or income.\n\nNow, the question is asking why the capability approach rejects Rawls' theory. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Because it fails to address the actual capabilities people have to benefit from his theory of justice.\n\nB. Because it ignores the duties of individuals.\n\nC. Because it applies only to democratic societies.\n\nD. Because it overlooks the importance of the courts.\n\nHmm, I need to think about each one.\n\nStarting with option A: It says that Rawls' theory doesn't address the actual capabilities people have to benefit from his theory. That sounds a bit convoluted. Let me rephrase it to myself. Is Rawls' theory insufficient in ensuring that people can actually use their capabilities to live a fulfilling life?\n\nI think the capability approach argues that Rawls' focus on distribution of primary goods like income and wealth isn't enough. Even if people have these resources, they might still lack the capabilities to use them effectively due to various social, cultural, or personal factors. For example, a person might have income to access education, but if the education system is poor, they still won't have the capability to be educated. So, the capability approach might say that Rawls' theory doesn't go far enough in ensuring that people can actually achieve valuable functionings or capabilities.\n\nThat seems plausible. But let's consider the other options.\n\nOption B: Because it ignores the duties of individuals. Hmm, Rawls' theory does talk about duties and obligations as part of his original position and the social contract. However, perhaps the capability approach places more emphasis on individual agency and the duties people have to develop their own capabilities. Maybe it thinks that Rawls' theory doesn't sufficiently account for the active role individuals play in shaping their own lives and capabilities.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Rawls does emphasize the importance of the \"sense of justice\" in individuals, which involves understanding and upholding the principles of justice. So, he does consider individual duties in that sense.\n\nOption C: Because it applies only to democratic societies. This seems a bit too limiting. Rawls' theory is often seen as applicable to any orderly society, not just democratic ones. He talks about \"well-ordered societies\" that could have different forms of government. The capability approach doesn't necessarily restrict itself to democracies either. So, this doesn't seem like a strong reason for rejection.\n\nOption D: Because it overlooks the importance of the courts. This seems specific to the judicial system. While the capability approach might emphasize the role of institutions in supporting capabilities, I don't think it specifically criticizes Rawls for ignoring courts. Maybe courts are part of the institutional framework that can affect capabilities, but this seems like a narrow point compared to broader criticisms.\n\nComparing all the options, option A seems to capture a central criticism that the capability approach has of Rawls' theory. The capability approach argues that Rawls' focus on resource distribution isn't sufficient because it doesn't ensure that people can actually use those resources to develop their capabilities and achieve a good life. So, perhaps the capability approach rejects Rawls' theory because it fails to address the actual capabilities people have to benefit from it.\n\nLet me see if I can rephrase this. Rawls' theory might ensure that people have certain resources or primary goods, but it doesn't guarantee that those resources translate into real capabilities. For example, giving someone money for food doesn't ensure they can actually get nourished if there's no access to healthy food options due to social inequalities or other factors.\n\nSo, the capability approach might say that Rawls' theory is incomplete because it doesn't consider the conversion factors that turn resources into actual capabilities.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option A: Because it fails to address the actual capabilities people have to benefit from his theory of justice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
