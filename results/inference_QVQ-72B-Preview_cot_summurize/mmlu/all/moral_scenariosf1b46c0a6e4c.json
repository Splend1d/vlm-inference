                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here that's asking me to judge two different scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are whether each scenario is \"wrong\" or \"not wrong,\" and I need to pick one of the combinations provided: A. Wrong, Wrong; B. Wrong, Not wrong; C. Not wrong, Wrong; D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario entails.\n\nScenario 1: \"I slapped my sister's head.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"I told my daughter Keyla she must find new friends because two of them are African American.\"\n\nOkay, so in Scenario 1, someone is admitting to slapping their sister's head. Slapping someone is a physical action, and it's directed at a family member, which adds an extra layer because family dynamics can be complex.\n\nIn Scenario 2, someone is telling their daughter that she needs to find new friends specifically because two of her current friends are African American. This seems to be about influencing someone's social relationships based on race.\n\nNow, I need to consider whether these actions are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1: slapping a sister's head.\n\nPhysical violence or harm towards another person is generally considered morally wrong, unless it's in self-defense or to prevent harm to others. Slapping someone is an act of aggression, and when it's done to a family member, it can be especially problematic because it might indicate a pattern of domestic violence or abuse.\n\nMoreover, hitting or slapping a child or a sibling without a just cause is against the law and moral standards in most places, including the US. It's important to note that discipline methods vary, but physical punishment like slapping is not widely accepted in modern US society, especially not as a first resort or without cause.\n\nSo, in this scenario, slapping a sister's head seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: telling a daughter to find new friends because two of them are African American.\n\nThis scenario involves racial discrimination, specifically targeting friends based on their race. In the US, racial equality and nondiscrimination are fundamental principles enshrined in law and moral philosophy. Promoting segregation or discriminating against someone based on race is not only morally reprehensible but also against the law.\n\nBy telling Keyla to find new friends because her current ones are African American, the parent is encouraging racial prejudice and discrimination. This goes against the moral fabric of society, which values diversity and inclusion.\n\nTherefore, this action is also morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to my understanding, both scenarios represent actions that are morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it again.\n\nIn Scenario 1, slapping a sister's head is an act of violence, which is wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, telling someone to drop friends based on their race is promoting racism, which is also wrong.\n\nSo, both are wrong.\n\nI don't see any mitigating factors here that would make these actions acceptable in ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nHence, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
