                    "text": "So I have this problem here about Yum-Yum Good candy bars and their calorie content. The average number of calories is 210, and the standard deviation is 10. The question is asking what percent of candy bars contain more than 225 calories, assuming the calories are normally distributed. Okay, so first things first, I need to understand what normal distribution means and how to use it to find the percentage of candy bars with more than 225 calories.\n\nI remember that in a normal distribution, the data is symmetrically distributed with the mean at the center. The standard deviation measures how spread out the data is from the mean. In this case, the mean (\u03bc) is 210 calories, and the standard deviation (\u03c3) is 10 calories.\n\nTo find the percentage of candy bars with more than 225 calories, I need to find the area under the normal curve to the right of 225. I know that in statistics, we often use z-scores to standardize values and find probabilities in a normal distribution. The z-score formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere x is the value we're interested in, which is 225 calories in this case.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{225 - 210}{10} = \\frac{15}{10} = 1.5 \\]\n\nSo, the z-score is 1.5. That means 225 calories is 1.5 standard deviations above the mean.\n\nNow, I need to find the area to the right of z = 1.5 in a standard normal distribution. I recall that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution gives the probability that a random variable from that distribution is less than or equal to a given value. So, the area to the left of z = 1.5 is P(Z \u2264 1.5), and the area to the right is P(Z > 1.5) = 1 - P(Z \u2264 1.5).\n\nI need to find P(Z > 1.5), which represents the percentage of candy bars with more than 225 calories.\n\nI think I should look up the z-score in a standard normal table to find P(Z \u2264 1.5). Then, subtract that value from 1 to get P(Z > 1.5).\n\nAlternatively, I might use a calculator or software that can compute the CDF of the normal distribution.\n\nLet me try to recall the values. For z = 1.5, I think the area to the left is approximately 0.9332. So, the area to the right would be 1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668, or 6.68%.\n\nWait a minute, let me verify that. If P(Z \u2264 1.5) is about 0.9332, then P(Z > 1.5) is indeed 1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668, which is 6.68%.\n\nBut looking back at the options, there's 6.68% listed as option D. However, there's also 66.80% which is option A. I need to make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. Starting from the beginning:\n\nMean \u03bc = 210 calories\n\nStandard deviation \u03c3 = 10 calories\n\nX = 225 calories\n\nZ = (225 - 210) / 10 = 1.5\n\nSo, z = 1.5\n\nNow, P(Z > 1.5) = 1 - P(Z \u2264 1.5)\n\nI need P(Z \u2264 1.5). I remember that for z = 1.5, the cumulative probability is approximately 0.9332.\n\nSo, P(Z > 1.5) = 1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668, or 6.68%.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure. Is there another way to confirm this?\n\nMaybe I can use the formula for the normal distribution to find the probability density function, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the empirical rule, which says that in a normal distribution:\n\n- Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean (\u03bc \u00b1 \u03c3)\n\n- Approximately 95% falls within two standard deviations (\u03bc \u00b1 2\u03c3)\n\n- Approximately 99.7% falls within three standard deviations (\u03bc \u00b1 3\u03c3)\n\nBut I'm not sure how to apply this directly to find the percentage above 225 calories.\n\nLet me see: Since 225 is 1.5 \u03c3 above the mean, and according to the empirical rule, about 68% is within \u03bc \u00b1 \u03c3, about 95% within \u03bc \u00b1 2\u03c3, and 99.7% within \u03bc \u00b1 3\u03c3.\n\nSo, between \u03bc and \u03bc + 1\u03c3, there's about 34% of the data, and between \u03bc and \u03bc + 2\u03c3, there's about 47.7% more, up to \u03bc + 2\u03c3.\n\nWait, actually, I think the exact values are:\n\nFrom \u03bc to \u03bc + 1\u03c3: 34.13%\n\nFrom \u03bc + 1\u03c3 to \u03bc + 2\u03c3: 13.59%\n\nFrom \u03bc + 2\u03c3 to \u03bc + 3\u03c3: 2.14%\n\nSo, from \u03bc to \u03bc + 1.5\u03c3, it's approximately 34.13% + (0.75 * 13.59%) \u2248 34.13 + 10.19 = 44.32%\n\nBut that's not directly helpful for finding P(Z > 1.5).\n\nMaybe I should stick with the z-table value of 0.9332 for P(Z \u2264 1.5), and then P(Z > 1.5) = 1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668, or 6.68%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that P(Z > 1.5) is roughly 6.68%, based on the z-table.\n\nWait, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 66.80%\n\nB. 47.70%\n\nC. 43.30%\n\nD. 6.68%\n\nSo, 6.68% seems to be the correct answer based on my calculation.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other way to interpret the question or if perhaps there's a mistake in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing something else, like understanding of the normal distribution properties or using the empirical rule for rough estimates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider using the continuity correction, but since we're dealing with a continuous variable (calories), that might not be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the fact that the distribution is normal and think about the symmetry.\n\nWait, another approach: Since it's a normal distribution, I can use the standard normal distribution table or use statistical software to find the exact value.\n\nIf I use a calculator, I can input the z-score of 1.5 and find the area to the right.\n\nAlternatively, in Excel, I can use the NORM.S.DIST function.\n\nWait, but I don't have Excel right now. Maybe I can look up a standard normal table online to confirm the value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recall that P(Z \u2264 1.5) is approximately 0.9332, so P(Z > 1.5) is 1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668, or 6.68%.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the standard normal cumulative distribution function:\n\n\\[ \\Phi(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{z} e^{-\\frac{t^2}{2}} dt \\]\n\nBut that seems too complicated for this purpose.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the error function, but again, that might be overkill.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the fact that P(Z > 1.5) is equal to P(Z < -1.5) due to symmetry, but that doesn't help me here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that P(Z > 1.5) is the same as P(Z < -1.5), but again, that doesn't give me a new value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for a standard normal distribution, the probability of Z being between 0 and 1.5 is about 0.4332, and from 0 to -1.5 is also 0.4332, so P(Z > 1.5) = 0.5 - 0.4332 = 0.0668, or 6.68%.\n\nYes, that seems to confirm my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider using the normal distribution's properties to find the exact value.\n\nWait, another way: I can use the formula for the normal distribution's probability density function, but since I'm interested in the cumulative probability, that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the normal distribution is symmetric around the mean, and use that symmetry to find the area beyond 1.5 standard deviations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that in a standard normal distribution, the area between \u03bc and \u03bc + \u03c3 is about 34.13%, between \u03bc + \u03c3 and \u03bc + 2\u03c3 is about 13.59%, and between \u03bc + 2\u03c3 and \u03bc + 3\u03c3 is about 2.14%.\n\nSo, from \u03bc to \u03bc + 1.5\u03c3, it's approximately 34.13% + (0.5 * 13.59%) \u2248 34.13% + 6.8% = 40.93%, and then from \u03bc + 1.5\u03c3 to \u03bc + 2\u03c3 is another 6.8%, and so on.\n\nBut this is just an approximation, and not as precise as using the z-table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the exact z-table value of 0.9332 for P(Z \u2264 1.5), and then P(Z > 1.5) = 1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668, or 6.68%.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the options might have a typo or are meant to test understanding of the normal distribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the distribution might not be perfectly normal, but in this problem, it's stated that it is normally distributed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the standard deviation is 10, and 225 is 1.5 standard deviations above the mean, so P(Z > 1.5) = 1 - P(Z \u2264 1.5) = 1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668, or 6.68%.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for a standard normal distribution, P(Z > z) = 1 - P(Z \u2264 z), and look up P(Z \u2264 1.5) in a table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recall that P(Z \u2264 1.5) is approximately 0.9332, so P(Z > 1.5) = 1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668, or 6.68%.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider using the normal distribution's properties to find the exact value, but I think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 6.68%, which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option D is 6.68%, but option A is 66.80%, which is ten times larger.\n\nIs there a possibility that I made a mistake in the decimal place?\n\nWait, no, 6.68% is clearly different from 66.80%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing whether students understand to convert percentages correctly, but in this case, 6.68% is clearly the right answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misprint in the options, and option D should be 6.68%, not 66.80%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the distribution might have different parameters, but the problem states it's normally distributed with mean 210 and standard deviation 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the distribution is not standard normal, but I already standardized it by calculating the z-score.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the distribution is not normal, but the problem says it is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the options might have a typo, and 6.68% is indeed the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the question is testing understanding of the z-table and the normal distribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the answer is 6.68%, which corresponds to option D.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct answer is option D, 6.68%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
