                    "text": "So I've got this question here about contracts, and it's a bit tricky because it involves an illegal substance. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nThe scenario is that Tom and Jerry have a contract where Tom agrees to sell Jerry $1,000 worth of heroin, which is illegal. The question is asking what kind of contract this is, and the options are:\n\nA. quasi contract\n\nB. void contract\n\nC. voidable contract\n\nD. secondary party beneficiary contract\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with a quasi contract: I think this is when there isn't a real contract, but the law imposes some obligations to prevent unjust enrichment. Like, if someone benefits from something without paying for it, the law might step in to make them pay. But in this case, we have a actual agreement between Tom and Jerry, so I don't think quasi contract applies here. Maybe I'm wrong, but it doesn't seem right.\n\nNext, a void contract is one that's not legally enforceable from the start. So, if the contract is about something illegal, like selling drugs, then it's probably void because it's against the law. But wait, is it void or voidable? I need to be careful here.\n\nVoidable contracts are ones that can be enforced unless one party chooses to void them. Usually, voidable contracts involve things like undue influence, fraud, or misrepresentation. So, if there's something wrong with how the contract was formed, one party can choose to cancel it.\n\nIn this case, though, the contract is about selling heroin, which is illegal. So, I don't think it's voidable; it's just plain void. It shouldn't be enforceable at all because it's against the law.\n\nNow, a secondary party beneficiary contract is when someone who isn't a party to the contract has a right to benefit from it. For example, if Tom and Jerry make a contract where Tom agrees to pay Jerry's debts to a third person, that third person is a secondary beneficiary. But in this scenario, it's just Tom selling heroin to Jerry, so there's no secondary beneficiary involved.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like the correct answer is B. void contract.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any chance it could be considered a voidable contract? Like, if Jerry was coerced into the contract or something, but the question doesn't specify that. It just says they entered into a contract, so I assume both parties agreed willingly.\n\nAlso, quasi contract doesn't seem to fit because it's more about situations where there isn't a contract, but the law steps in to prevent unfairness. Here, there's a clear contract between Tom and Jerry.\n\nAnd as for the secondary party beneficiary, unless there's someone else involved who's supposed to benefit, which isn't mentioned, that option doesn't seem relevant.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. void contract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
