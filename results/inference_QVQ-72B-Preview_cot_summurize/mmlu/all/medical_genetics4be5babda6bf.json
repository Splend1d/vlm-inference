                    "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question about exons in protein-coding genes. I have four statements here, and I need to figure out which one is correct. I'm not entirely sure about all of them, but I'll try to think through each one.\n\nStarting with option A: \"Some exons in protein-coding genes consist of noncoding DNA.\" Hmm, I thought that exons are the parts of the gene that code for proteins, so they should contain coding DNA, right? But I recall that sometimes, exons can include regulatory regions or other noncoding sequences. Maybe in some genes, there are exons that don't code for protein? I'm a bit confused here.\n\nMoving on to option B: \"The first exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the translational start site.\" I remember that the translational start site is where translation begins, marked by a start codon, usually AUG. In most genes, the first exon does include the start codon. But is it always the case? I think in some genes, especially those with leader sequences or signal peptides, the start codon might be in the second exon. Let me think about that. Maybe it's not always true.\n\nOption C: \"The last exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the normal termination codon.\" I know that the termination codon signals the end of translation. Typically, it's found in the last exon because introns are spliced out, and exons are concatenated to form the mRNA that is translated. So, it makes sense that the stop codon would be in the last exon. But is it always the case? I can't think of any exceptions off the top of my head, but maybe there are some special cases where the stop codon is in an intron or something. Seems unlikely.\n\nLastly, option D: \"A coding exon is always translated in just one of the three possible forward reading frames.\" I remember that the reading frame is set by the start codon, and once that's established, the rest of the mRNA is read in that frame until the stop codon. So, yes, each coding exon should be translated in a single reading frame. But wait, what if there are internal start codons or something? I think generally, exons are part of a continuous reading frame from start to stop codon, so this seems correct.\n\nAlright, now let's see. I need to choose which statement is correct. Maybe more than one is correct? The question says \"which, if any, of the following statements is correct.\"\n\nLooking back at option A, I'm still unsure. I thought exons were coding regions, but I've heard of exon skipping and alternative splicing, where some exons may not be included in the final mRNA, so perhaps some exons are noncoding. But I'm not certain.\n\nFor option B, I think it's not always true because in some genes, the start codon might be in the second exon. For example, in some genes with alternative first exons, the start codon could be in a different exon depending on the transcript variant.\n\nOption C seems reasonable. I can't think of a reason why the stop codon wouldn't be in the last exon. Unless there's some unusual splicing where introns are retained, but in normal splicing, the last exon should contain the stop codon.\n\nOption D also seems correct. Each coding exon is part of the open reading frame defined by the start and stop codons, so it should be translated in a single reading frame.\n\nSo, if I had to choose one that's definitely correct, I'd go with option D. But I have a feeling that options C and D might both be correct. Let me check again.\n\nOption C: Last exon contains the termination codon. Yes, that makes sense because introns are spliced out, and the last exon marks the end of the coding sequence.\n\nOption D: Coding exons are translated in one reading frame. That also makes sense because the reading frame is set by the start codon and continues until the stop codon.\n\nOption A: Some exons consist of noncoding DNA. I'm still unsure. Maybe in some cases, but generally, exons are coding regions.\n\nOption B: First exon always contains the start site. Probably not always, due to alternative splicing and different transcript variants.\n\nSo, perhaps options C and D are correct. But the question says \"which, if any,\" suggesting that there might be multiple correct statements, or possibly just one.\n\nWait, maybe I need to select only one correct statement. In that case, I'd choose option D, as it seems the most straightforward and generally true.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all of them are correct except option B. Yeah, that could be it.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- A: Some exons may contain noncoding DNA \u2013 possibly true, but I'm not sure.\n\n- B: First exon always contains the start site \u2013 probably not always true due to alternative splicing.\n\n- C: Last exon contains the stop codon \u2013 likely true in most cases.\n\n- D: Coding exons are translated in one reading frame \u2013 yes, that's how reading frames work.\n\nTherefore, options C and D are correct, while A might be sometimes true and B is not always true.\n\nBut since the question asks for \"which, if any,\" and I'm not sure about A, I'll go with C and D as correct statements.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C \\text{ and } D} \\]"
