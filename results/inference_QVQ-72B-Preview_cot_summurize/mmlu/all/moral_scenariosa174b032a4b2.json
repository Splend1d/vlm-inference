                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I plucked the rare flowers in the public garden.\" So, someone picked rare flowers from a public garden. Okay, let's break this down. It's a public garden, which probably means it's maintained for everyone's enjoyment, right? And the flowers are rare, which might make them even more valuable or special.\n\nPlucking flowers in general can be seen as destructive because it removes the beauty for others and possibly harms the plant's ability to reproduce. But maybe in some gardens, picking flowers is allowed, like in community gardens or certain parks. However, since these are rare flowers, it's likely that they're protected or meant to be preserved.\n\nI recall that in many places, especially with rare or endangered plants, it's against the law to pick them because they need to be conserved. So, even if it's a public space, that doesn't necessarily mean you can take things from it, especially if they're rare.\n\nAlso, there's a concept called \"public trust resources,\" where certain things in public spaces are held in trust for the benefit of all citizens, and taking them without permission is wrong, both legally and morally.\n\nSo, in this scenario, plucking rare flowers in a public garden seems like it could be considered morally wrong, and possibly legally wrong too, depending on the specific rules of the garden.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: \"I broke his running record.\" Hmm, this one is a bit trickier. Breaking someone's record in sports can have different connotations.\n\nFirst off, in sports, breaking a record is usually seen as a positive achievement. It shows that you've performed better than someone else did before, and that's generally celebrated. For example, if you run a mile faster than someone else did, that's your achievement and doesn't directly harm anyone else.\n\nHowever, there could be contexts where breaking a record might not be seen as positive. Maybe if you cheated to break the record, or if breaking the record led to some negative consequences for others.\n\nBut the scenario here doesn't provide any additional information about how the record was broken or what the consequences were. It just says, \"I broke his running record.\"\n\nAssuming that the record was broken fairly, without any cheating or harmful actions, then it's hard to see how this would be morally wrong. Competition is a natural part of sports, and striving to be better than others is generally accepted as part of the game.\n\nUnless, of course, breaking the record had some negative impact on the person whose record was broken. For example, if they lost a scholarship or some other benefit because their record was surpassed. But even then, it's not necessarily morally wrong to compete and succeed; it's more about the rules and ethics of the competition.\n\nSo, based on the information given, it seems like breaking someone's running record is not morally wrong, provided it was done fairly and without malicious intent.\n\nPutting both scenarios together:\n\nScenario 1: Plucking rare flowers in a public garden \u2013 this seems morally wrong because it's destructive, potentially against the law, and goes against the idea of preserving public trust resources.\n\nScenario 2: Breaking his running record \u2013 this seems morally acceptable, assuming it was done fairly and without cheating.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any way that breaking a running record could be considered morally wrong in ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020?\n\nWell, perhaps if the person whose record was broken suffered some harm as a result, but again, that's not indicated in the scenario. Based on the information provided, it's just about breaking a record, without any negative consequences specified.\n\nAlso, in sports ethics, breaking a record is encouraged as it pushes athletes to improve and sets new standards for performance.\n\nOn the other hand, plucking rare flowers in a public garden is clearly a destructive act that goes against the preservation of natural beauty and possibly breaks laws protecting endangered species or public property.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll consider if there's any other perspective that might see breaking a running record as morally wrong. Maybe if the person breaking the record was gloating or disrespecting the previous record-holder, but again, the scenario doesn't provide any information about the person's attitude or behavior beyond just breaking the record.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, plucking rare flowers in a public garden is morally wrong, while breaking someone's running record is not, provided it was done fairly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
