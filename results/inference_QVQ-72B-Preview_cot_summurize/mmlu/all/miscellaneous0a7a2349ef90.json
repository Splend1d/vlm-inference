                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which company makes perfumes called 'Beautiful' and 'Pleasures.' The options are Estee Lauder, Ralph Lauren, Elizabeth Arden, and Calvin Klein. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with perfume brands, but I've heard of some of these companies.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall if I've ever come across these perfume names in relation to any of these brands. 'Beautiful' sounds like it might be associated with Estee Lauder because I think they have a famous perfume by that name. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Estee Lauder. I know Estee Lauder is a well-known beauty and fragrance brand. They've been around for a long time, and I think they have a signature perfume called 'Beautiful.' I remember seeing advertisements for it before, maybe in magazines or online. So, that seems like a likely candidate for 'Beautiful.'\n\nBut what about 'Pleasures'? I'm not sure if Estee Lauder makes 'Pleasures' as well. Wait, maybe it's the same company that makes both perfumes. That would make sense, especially since sometimes perfume lines are expanded with similar scents.\n\nNext, Ralph Lauren. I know Ralph Lauren is famous for clothing, especially polo shirts and fashion apparel. They also make fragrances, both for men and women. But I don't recall any specific perfume names from Ralph Lauren that match 'Beautiful' or 'Pleasures.' Maybe I'm wrong, but I think their fragrances have different names, like 'Polo' for men or 'Romance' for women.\n\nMoving on to Elizabeth Arden. This is another well-known beauty and fragrance brand. I think they have several perfume lines, but again, I don't remember any called 'Beautiful' or 'Pleasures.' Maybe they have similar names, but not exactly those. I think 'Beautiful' is more associated with Estee Lauder.\n\nLastly, Calvin Klein. Known for its trendy clothing and iconic fragrances like 'CK One' and 'Eternity.' While Calvin Klein definitely makes perfumes, I don't think 'Beautiful' or 'Pleasures' are among their offerings. Again, the names don't ring a bell for Calvin Klein.\n\nLet me double-check my memory. I think Estee Lauder definitely makes 'Beautiful.' Now, for 'Pleasures,' I seem to recall that it's also by Estee Lauder. In fact, I think 'Pleasures' might be part of the 'Beautiful' fragrance line, maybe as a variant or a related scent.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Often, perfume companies create similar scents within the same line, appealing to customers who like the original but want something a bit different. So, if 'Beautiful' is by Estee Lauder and 'Pleasures' is also by them, possibly as part of the same collection, then the answer should be Estee Lauder.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if any of the other companies might have perfumes with similar names or if there's any possibility of confusion. For example, Elizabeth Arden has perfumes like 'Untold' and '5th Avenue,' which are different from 'Beautiful' and 'Pleasures.' Similarly, Ralph Lauren has perfumes like 'Romance' and 'Midnight Romance,' and Calvin Klein has 'Eternity' and 'Infinite.' None of these are 'Beautiful' or 'Pleasures.'\n\nTherefore, based on my recollection and elimination process, I'm confident that Estee Lauder is the company that makes perfumes called 'Beautiful' and 'Pleasures.'\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A.
