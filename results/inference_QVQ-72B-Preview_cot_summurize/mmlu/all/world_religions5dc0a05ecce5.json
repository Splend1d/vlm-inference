Hmm, I need to figure this out. I think I have some knowledge about this, but I might be a bit rusty.\n\nFirst off, I know that Hebrew is the language of the Jewish scriptures, like the Torah and the Tanakh. So, mashiach is a Hebrew word, and I recall that in Judaism, the concept of the Messiah is important. But what exactly does mashiach mean?\n\nLet me see. I think the word mashiach comes from the Hebrew verb \"to anoint,\" which is like pouring oil over someone's head, usually as part of a ritual to consecrate them for a special purpose. So, if I remember correctly, in ancient times, kings, priests, and prophets were sometimes anointed with oil to signify that they were chosen by God for their roles.\n\nSo, based on that, mashiach would literally mean \"anointed one.\" That seems to align with option A. Anointed one.\n\nBut let's check the other options to make sure. Option B is God. Does mashiach mean God? Well, no, I don't think so. In Hebrew, the word for God is Elohim or Yahweh, not mashiach. So, that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C is Prophet. While prophets were sometimes anointed, mashiach isn't specifically used to refer only to prophets. I think the term can apply to kings and priests as well, not just prophets.\n\nOption D is The line of David. Now, this is interesting. In Jewish tradition, the Messiah is often expected to be from the house of David, meaning a descendant of King David. So, the Messiah is sometimes referred to as the line of David. But is mashiach itself the same as the line of David?\n\nI think the term mashiach refers to the anointed one, who could be a king, a priest, or a prophet, but specifically, the Messiah is expected to be a king from the line of David. So, while the Messiah is from the line of David, mashiach isn't exclusively about the line of David; it's a broader term for an anointed one.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think deeper. In the context of the Hebrew Bible, who were some of the people who were called mashiach?\n\nI recall that King David was anointed by Samuel, so he was a mashiach. Similarly, other kings after him were anointed. Priests like Aaron were also anointed. And some prophets might have been anointed as well, though I'm not as sure about that.\n\nBut in the broader sense, mashiach seems to refer to someone who is set apart by God for a specific purpose, through the act of anointment.\n\nNow, in the context of Judaism, the term Messiah, or mashiach, took on a more specific meaning over time. The Jews were expecting a messiah who would restore Israel and bring about a golden age. This messiah was believed to be a descendant of David, hence the reference to the line of David.\n\nBut again, the term mashiach itself is more general, meaning anointed one, and was applied to various figures in Jewish history, not just to the expected messiah.\n\nSo, going back to the question, what does the Hebrew word mashiach mean? It seems pretty clear that it means \"anointed one,\" which corresponds to option A.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other possible interpretation. Maybe in certain contexts, mashiach could mean something else. For example, in some translations, mashiach is rendered as \"messiah\" or \"christ,\" which both derive from the idea of anointed one.\n\nHowever, none of the other options seem to fit. It doesn't mean God, nor does it mean prophet specifically, and while the messiah is from the line of David, the term mashiach isn't synonymous with the line of David itself.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer should be A. Anointed one.\n\nI think that's the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
