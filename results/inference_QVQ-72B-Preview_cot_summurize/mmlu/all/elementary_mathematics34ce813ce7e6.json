I'm a bit rusty on fractions, but I think I can manage.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"three fifth\" means. Three fifth is a fraction, right? So, it's 3 over 5, or 3/5. Okay, so the problem is asking for 3/5 of 100. Now, how do I calculate that?\n\nI remember that to find a fraction of a number, I can multiply the fraction by the number. So, 3/5 times 100. But multiplying fractions isn't my strong suit. Maybe I can think of it another way.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is to divide 100 by 5 first, and then multiply by 3. That sounds easier. So, 100 divided by 5 is 20, and then multiplied by 3 is 60. Is that correct? Let me check.\n\nIf I take 100 and divide it by 5, I get 20, which is one fifth of 100. Then, if I multiply that by 3, I should get three fifths of 100. So, 20 times 3 is 60. That seems to make sense.\n\nBut let me try the multiplication way to double-check. To multiply 3/5 by 100, I can write it as (3/5) * 100. Now, 100 is the same as 100/1, so it's (3/5) * (100/1) = (3 * 100) / (5 * 1) = 300 / 5. And 300 divided by 5 is also 60.\n\nOkay, so both methods give me the same answer of 60. That seems consistent. But just to be sure, maybe I should consider another approach. Perhaps using decimals or something, but that might complicate things more.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of percentages. Three fifths is 0.6, right? Because 3 divided by 5 is 0.6. So, 0.6 times 100 would be 60. Again, that confirms the same answer.\n\nWait a minute, but one of the options is 20, which is what I got when I divided 100 by 5. But that's only one fifth, and the question is asking for three fifths. So, 20 is one fifth of 100, and three fifths should be three times that, which is 60.\n\nI think I might have been momentarily confused there. So, the correct answer should be 60, which is option D.\n\nLet me just check if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Is there any context where three fifth of 100 could be something else? For example, if it's not a straight fraction but something else, but no, it seems straightforward.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here; it's a direct question about fractions. So, I'm confident that the answer is D. 60.\n\nJust to make sure, let me summarize:\n\n- Three fifth is 3/5.\n\n- Three fifth of 100 is 3/5 * 100.\n\n- 3/5 * 100 = 60.\n\nYes, that's clear. So, the answer is D. 60.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
