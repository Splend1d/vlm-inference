                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario here about a man and a woman who lived together but were never married. They bought a house together, but only the man's name is on the deed because he had better credit and could get a mortgage. The woman gave up her night law school classes to be a homemaker and worked as a waitress to pay for household expenses like food and laundry. The man paid for the mortgage, taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs, and other expenses.\n\nAfter several years, they had problems and the man asked the woman to leave. She did, and now she's suing to get half of the house's equity and a share of other property and accounts that were built up in the man's name during their time together.\n\nI need to figure out which of the given arguments is the strongest for the woman to get a fair share of the property. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. There is an express contract between them to share the property equally.\n\nHmm, an express contract would be something they both agreed to in writing, like a cohabitation agreement specifying how they'd split the property if they split up. But the scenario doesn't mention any such agreement. Maybe they had some discussions about it, but nothing formal. So, unless there's evidence of a written agreement, this might not be the strongest argument.\n\nB. He has been unjustly enriched and he owes her restitution under a quasi-contract legal theory.\n\nOkay, unjust enrichment is when one person benefits at another's expense without a legal basis. Here, the woman contributed to the household by giving up her law school classes, being a homemaker, and paying for things like food and laundry. The man benefited from her contributions, possibly allowing him to afford the mortgage and other expenses because she was covering those day-to-day costs.\n\nIf the man was able to build equity in the house and save money because the woman was covering certain expenses, she might argue that he was unjustly enriched by her contributions. She might seek restitution, which is the return of the value she provided.\n\nThis seems like a plausible argument. But let's see the other options.\n\nC. She is entitled to damages based on a legal theory of fraudulent conversion.\n\nConversion is when someone wrongfully takes or uses another person's property. In this case, the woman might argue that the man converted the value of her contributions to the household or the property.\n\nHowever, conversion typically involves tangible property, like money or belongings. It's not clear if this directly applies to her contributions as a homemaker or her payments for household expenses.\n\nMaybe this isn't the strongest argument, unless there's specific evidence that the man misused funds intended for certain expenses.\n\nD. She is may be remunerated under the federal civil rights laws prohibiting gender discrimination.\n\nThis one seems a bit of a stretch. Civil rights laws prohibiting gender discrimination are generally about employment, education, and similar areas, not about private relationships and property ownership.\n\nUnless there's some specific context where gender discrimination applies to cohabitation arrangements, this doesn't seem like a strong argument here.\n\nSo, comparing A, B, C, and D, option B seems the strongest. The concept of unjust enrichment is often applied in cases where one party has benefited from the efforts or contributions of another without proper compensation, especially in the absence of a formal contract.\n\nThe woman gave up her education and worked to support the household, which likely contributed to the man's ability to pay the mortgage and build equity in the house. If the court recognizes that her contributions enriched the man's position, she might be entitled to restitution, perhaps in the form of a monetary award representing her share of the property's equity.\n\nTherefore, the best and strongest argument the woman may assert is that the man has been unjustly enriched and owes her restitution under a quasi-contract legal theory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
