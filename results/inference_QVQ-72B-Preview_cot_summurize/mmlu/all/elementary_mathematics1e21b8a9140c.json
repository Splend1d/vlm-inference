                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about an office building's floor space. It says the building has 300,000 + 5,000 + 600 + 10 square feet of floor space. And I need to write that number in standard form. The options are A. 30,561, B. 35,610, C. 300,561, and D. 305,610.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to add up these numbers: 300,000, 5,000, 600, and 10. I think the main part here is just doing the addition correctly, but I should be careful with the place values to make sure I don't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me start by adding 300,000 and 5,000. 300,000 plus 5,000 is 305,000. Then, I'll add 600 to that. 305,000 plus 600 is 305,600. Finally, adding the last 10, so 305,600 plus 10 is 305,610.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but I should double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe I can approach it differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the place values. 300,000 is three hundred thousand, which is the highest term. Then 5,000 is five thousand, 600 is six hundred, and 10 is ten. Adding them all together:\n\nHundreds place: 600\n\nThousands place: 5,000\n\nHigher places: 300,000\n\nAnd the units place: 10\n\nSo, combining these, it should be 300,000 + 5,000 + 600 + 10.\n\nLet me add these step by step again to be sure.\n\nFirst, add 300,000 and 5,000:\n\n300,000\n\n+  5,000\n\n= 305,000\n\nThen add 600:\n\n305,000\n\n+    600\n\n= 305,600\n\nFinally, add 10:\n\n305,600\n\n+    10\n\n= 305,610\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same result: 305,610.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 30,561\n\nB. 35,610\n\nC. 300,561\n\nD. 305,610\n\nSo, option D. 305,610 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. The problem says \"300,000 + 5,000 + 600 + 10 square feet of floor space.\" It's straightforward addition, so I don't think there's any trick here, like different units or anything like that.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions \"standard form.\" I believe standard form is just the usual way we write numbers, as opposed to expanded form or something else. So, 305,610 is indeed in standard form.\n\nI don't think I've made any errors here, but just to be extra sure, I can add the numbers again.\n\n300,000 plus 5,000 is indeed 305,000.\n\n305,000 plus 600 is 305,600.\n\n305,600 plus 10 is 305,610.\n\nYes, I'm confident that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is D. 305,610.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
