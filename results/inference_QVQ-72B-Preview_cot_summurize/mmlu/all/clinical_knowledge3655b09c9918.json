                    "text": "So I have this question about ulnar nerve palsy, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that the ulnar nerve can be affected by a fracture of the spiral groove of the humerus. Hmm, I remember that the spiral groove is where the radial nerve runs, not the ulnar nerve. So, if there's a fracture there, it's more likely to affect the radial nerve rather than the ulnar nerve. Maybe this isn't correct.\n\nOption B mentions that it gives rise to a positive Phalen's sign. I recall that Phalen's sign is related to carpal tunnel syndrome, which affects the median nerve. Ulnar nerve palsy is about the ulnar nerve, so this probably isn't relevant here. Maybe not the right choice.\n\nOption C says that it leads to loss of sensation over the medial half of the hand and medial one and a half digits on both palmar and dorsal aspects of the hand. That sounds familiar. The ulnar nerve innervates the medial aspect of the hand, including the little finger and part of the ring finger on both sides. So, if someone has ulnar nerve palsy, they should have sensory loss in those areas. This seems plausible.\n\nOption D states that it supplies the biceps muscles. Wait, the biceps are innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve, not the ulnar nerve. So, this can't be right. Ulnar nerve supplies some intrinsic hand muscles, not the biceps.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems to be the correct answer. Let me just double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nFirst, the ulnar nerve does indeed innervate the medial aspect of the hand, including the little finger and the medial half of the ring finger on both the palmar and dorsal sides. So, if there's ulnar nerve palsy, there should be sensory loss in those regions. That matches with option C.\n\nOption A is about a fracture of the spiral groove affecting the ulnar nerve, but I think the spiral groove is more associated with the radial nerve, so that seems unlikely.\n\nOption B refers to Phalen's sign, which is associated with carpal tunnel syndrome affecting the median nerve, not the ulnar nerve.\n\nOption D says the ulnar nerve supplies the biceps muscles, but that's not correct; the biceps are supplied by the musculocutaneous nerve.\n\nTherefore, the true statement is option C: it leads to loss of sensation over the medial half of the hand and medial one and a half digits on both palmar and dorsal aspects of the hand.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
