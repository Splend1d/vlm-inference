                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"____ involves mental retardation and extreme obesity and is caused by a chromosomal deletion. A. Down Syndrome B. Turner syndrome C. Klinefelter syndrome. D. Prader-Willi syndrome\"\n\nOkay, I need to figure out which of these conditions is characterized by mental retardation and extreme obesity and is also caused by a chromosomal deletion. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nFirst, Down Syndrome. I know that Down Syndrome is caused by an extra chromosome, usually an extra copy of chromosome 21. So, it's not a deletion; it's an addition. Plus, while people with Down Syndrome can have cognitive impairments, I don't think extreme obesity is a typical symptom. Maybe sometimes, but not primarily known for extreme obesity.\n\nNext, Turner syndrome. I recall that Turner syndrome affects females and is usually caused by missing an X chromosome. So, it's a chromosomal abnormality, but it's not a deletion; it's a monosomy, meaning one copy of a chromosome is missing. Also, the symptoms include short stature, infertility, and other developmental issues, but again, not necessarily extreme obesity.\n\nThen, Klinefelter syndrome. This one affects males and is caused by having an extra X chromosome, so it's the opposite of Turner syndrome. Symptoms include taller than average stature, smaller testes, and sometimes lower testosterone levels. Again, mental retardation and extreme obesity aren't primary features of this condition.\n\nFinally, Prader-Willi syndrome. Hmm, I've heard of this one before. Let me think. Prader-Willi syndrome is known for causing obesity, especially extreme appetite and food-seeking behavior. It also can affect cognitive development, leading to learning difficulties. Now, is it caused by a chromosomal deletion?\n\nI think so. I believe it's associated with a deletion on chromosome 15. Let me confirm that. Yes, Prader-Willi syndrome is typically caused by a deletion of a small portion of chromosome 15 inherited from the father. This deletion leads to the absence of several genes that are important for normal development.\n\nSo, comparing all the options:\n\n- Down Syndrome: extra chromosome 21, not a deletion, and primary symptoms include cognitive impairments but not extreme obesity.\n\n- Turner syndrome: missing X chromosome, not a deletion, and symptoms relate more to growth and reproductive health.\n\n- Klinefelter syndrome: extra X chromosome, not a deletion, and symptoms relate to physical development and hormonal imbalances.\n\n- Prader-Willi syndrome: chromosomal deletion on chromosome 15, leads to extreme obesity and mental retardation.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be D. Prader-Willi syndrome.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check my understanding. Prader-Willi syndrome is indeed characterized by hyperphagia (excessive hunger), which can lead to extreme obesity if not managed properly. It also involves varying degrees of cognitive impairments, which can range from mild to severe. The condition is typically caused by a deletion of a specific region on the paternal chromosome 15.\n\nSo, based on this information, D. Prader-Willi syndrome is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
