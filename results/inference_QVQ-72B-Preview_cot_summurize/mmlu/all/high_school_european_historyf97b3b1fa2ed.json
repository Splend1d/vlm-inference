His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe conflict referred to in the final paragraph of the passage was best described in which book?\n\nA. On Liberty, by John Stuart Mill\nB. The Communist Manifesto, by Marx and Engels\nC. Protocols of the Elders of Zion\nD. Looking Backward, by Edward Bellamy\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this passage from \u00c9mile Zola's \"Germinal,\" and it's pretty intense. There's a character, Souvarine, who seems really disillusioned with the state of things in Russia and with the Nihilists, these famous revolutionaries who were causing a stir in Europe. He talks about how they're all turning to politicians and seem fixated on national liberation, especially killing their despot, which he dismisses as \"foolery.\"\n\nThen he shifts to talking about his own experiences and dreams. He mentions renouncing his rank and fortune to live among workers, hoping to see the beginnings of a new society based on shared labor and cooperation. But he's disappointed that this fusion hasn't happened. He seems to have given away all his money to help others, showing kindness and working alongside the colliers, but it hasn't led to the kind of social change he envisioned.\n\nThe passage then takes a personal turn when he directly addresses someone named \u00c9tienne, probably the protagonist of the novel. Souvarine criticizes the hatworkers in Marseilles who won a big lottery prize and instead of using it for something noble, they invested it to live off it without working. He sees this as a reflection of French workers' desire to accumulate wealth for themselves rather than using it for the greater good. He accuses them of wanting to be bourgeois themselves, envying the rich not because they want to change the system but because they want to be in the rich's place.\n\nHe concludes by saying that as long as workers own anything, they won't be worthy of happiness, and their hatred for the bourgeoisie is just a mask for their own desire to become bourgeois.\n\nNow, the question is asking which book best describes the conflict referred to in the final paragraph. The options are:\n\nA. On Liberty, by John Stuart Mill\n\nB. The Communist Manifesto, by Marx and Engels\n\nC. Protocols of the Elders of Zion\n\nD. Looking Backward, by Edward Bellamy\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the conflict is in the final paragraph. Souvarine is criticizing the workers' individualistic tendencies and their desire for personal wealth, which he sees as contrary to the ideals of socialism or communism. He believes that as long as workers hold onto private property, they can't achieve true happiness and that their resentment towards the bourgeoisie is just a desire to switch places with them rather than eliminating class differences altogether.\n\nSo, the conflict here is between the ideals of collectivism and socialism versus individualism and capitalism. It's about the tension between working together for the common good and working for one's own self-interest.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. On Liberty by John Stuart Mill: This book is about the importance of individual liberty and the harm principle, which suggests that individuals should be free to do as they please as long as they don't harm others. While it deals with individualism, it doesn't directly address the class struggle or the conflict between workers and the bourgeoisie in the way Souvarine is describing.\n\nB. The Communist Manifesto by Marx and Engels: This is a foundational text of communism that outlines the historical materialism and the class struggle between the proletariat (workers) and the bourgeoisie (capitalists). It argues that workers must overthrow the capitalist system and establish a classless society. This seems very relevant to Souvarine's criticism of workers who want to become bourgeois rather than eliminating class distinctions.\n\nC. Protocols of the Elders of Zion: This is a notorious anti-Semitic forgery that purports to describe a Jewish plan for global domination. It has nothing to do with the class struggle or the conflict between workers and the bourgeoisie.\n\nD. Looking Backward by Edward Bellamy: This is a utopian novel that imagines a socialist future where inequality and class distinctions have been eliminated through a cooperative economic system. While it does deal with social reform and the elimination of class differences, it's more of a positive vision of the future rather than a critique of workers' individualistic tendencies.\n\nGiven these considerations, The Communist Manifesto by Marx and Engels seems to be the most fitting choice. It directly addresses the class struggle and the need for workers to unite against the bourgeoisie, rather than aspiring to become like them. Souvarine's criticism of workers who want to accumulate wealth for themselves and his advocacy for a collective approach align with Marxist thought.\n\nSo, my answer would be B. The Communist Manifesto, by Marx and Engels.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
