                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this pediatric case. There's a 4-year-old girl who's generally healthy, but during a routine check-up, the doctor hears some murmurs in her heart. Let me try to understand what these murmurs might indicate.\n\nFirst, there's a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard along the upper left sternal border. Then, S2, which I believe is the second heart sound, is widely split and doesn't vary with respiration. Additionally, there's a soft mid-diastolic murmur heard along the lower left sternal border. The rest of the examination is normal.\n\nOkay, so murmurs are sounds produced by turbulent blood flow in the heart. The grade of the murmur indicates its loudness, with 1 being very soft and 6 being extremely loud. A grade 2 is mild.\n\nA systolic ejection murmur suggests that there's turbulence during the contraction phase of the heart, when blood is being pumped out of the ventricles. This could be due to a narrowing somewhere, like in a valve.\n\nThe split S2 sound is interesting. S2 is normally composed of the aortic and pulmonary valve closures. When they don't close at the same time, it's called a split S2. If it's widely split and doesn't vary with respiration, that might point towards a particular condition.\n\nThen there's a soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border. Diastole is the relaxation phase of the heart, so this murmur is happening when the heart is filling up with blood.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Aortic stenosis\n\nB. Atrial septal defect\n\nC. Coarctation of the aorta\n\nD. Mitral valve prolapse\n\nLet me consider each one.\n\nAortic stenosis is a narrowing of the aortic valve, which would make it harder for blood to flow out of the left ventricle. This would typically cause a systolic ejection murmur, often heard best along the left sternal border. But I don't recall aortic stenosis causing a mid-diastolic murmur. So, maybe not the best fit.\n\nB. Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a hole in the wall between the two atria of the heart. This can lead to abnormal blood flow from the left atrium to the right atrium, which can cause murmurs. In ASD, you might hear a fixed split S2, meaning it doesn't vary with respiration, which matches what's described here. Also, sometimes ASD can be associated with a diastolic murmur due to increased flow through the tricuspid valve.\n\nC. Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta, usually near the ductus arteriosus. It can cause a systolic murmur, often heard best in the back or between the shoulder blades. But I don't think it typically causes a mid-diastolic murmur or a widely split S2.\n\nD. Mitral valve prolapse is when one of the valves in the heart doesn't close properly, often causing a murmur. It's usually a systolic murmur, sometimes with a click. I don't think it typically causes a split S2 or a diastolic murmur.\n\nSo, comparing all these, atrial septal defect seems to fit the description best. It can cause a systolic ejection murmur and a widely split S2 that doesn't vary with respiration. Plus, it might cause a diastolic murmur due to increased flow through the tricuspid valve.\n\nI should double-check this. In ASD, the blood flows from the left atrium to the right atrium, increasing the volume in the right side of the heart. This can lead to increased flow through the tricuspid valve during diastole, which might cause a diastolic murmur. Also, the split S2 is a classic sign in ASD, especially if it's widely split and fixed, meaning it doesn't change with breathing.\n\nAortic stenosis, while it can cause a systolic ejection murmur, typically doesn't present with a split S2 or a diastolic murmur in this manner. Coarctation of the aorta might cause a systolic murmur, but it's usually heard in a different location and doesn't typically involve a diastolic murmur or a split S2. Mitral valve prolapse is more likely to cause a systolic click and murmur, without the split S2 or diastolic components.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the described findings is an atrial septal defect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
