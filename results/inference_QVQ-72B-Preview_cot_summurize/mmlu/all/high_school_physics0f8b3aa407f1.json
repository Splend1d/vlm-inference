                    "text": "So I have this problem about a diverging mirror. An object is placed 10 cm in front of it, and the image appears 2 cm behind the mirror. I need to find the focal length of the mirror. The options are A. -3/5 cm, B. -5/3 cm, C. -2/5 cm, and D. -5/2 cm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the mirror formula. For a mirror, the formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{d_o} + \\frac{1}{d_i}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(f\\) is the focal length,\n\n- \\(d_o\\) is the object distance,\n\n- \\(d_i\\) is the image distance.\n\nSince it's a diverging mirror, the focal length should be negative. I remember that for diverging mirrors, the focal length is negative in sign convention.\n\nGiven that the object is 10 cm in front of the mirror, \\(d_o = 10\\) cm.\n\nThe image is 2 cm behind the mirror, so \\(d_i = -2\\) cm. I think it's negative because it's behind the mirror, meaning it's virtual.\n\nPlugging these into the mirror formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{-2} = \\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{5}{10} = -\\frac{4}{10} = -\\frac{2}{5} \\text{ cm}^{-1}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nf = -\\frac{5}{2} \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nLooking back at the options, D. -5/2 cm seems to be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs.\n\nFor a diverging mirror, the focal length is negative. The object distance is positive since it's in front of the mirror, and the image distance is negative since it's virtual and behind the mirror.\n\nSo, plugging into the formula again:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{-2} = \\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{4}{10} = -\\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct. So \\(f = -\\frac{5}{2}\\) cm.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to look at it, maybe using the mirror formula in a different form or considering the properties of diverging mirrors.\n\nI know that for spherical mirrors, the focal length is related to the radius of curvature by:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{R}{2}\n\\]\n\nBut in this problem, I don't have the radius of curvature given, so that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the magnification formula to cross-verify, but since magnification isn't asked for, maybe it's not necessary here.\n\nLet me see if I can find another approach. Perhaps using ray diagrams mentally: for a diverging mirror, rays coming from an object seem to diverge from the mirror, and the image is virtual.\n\nGiven that, the image distance should indeed be negative, as I used in my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the mirror formula again but consider the sign conventions more carefully.\n\nAccording to the standard sign conventions for mirrors:\n\n- The object distance \\(d_o\\) is positive if the object is in front of the mirror (real), which it is here.\n\n- The image distance \\(d_i\\) is positive if the image is real and in front of the mirror, negative if virtual behind the mirror.\n\n- The focal length \\(f\\) is negative for diverging mirrors.\n\nSo, my initial calculation should be correct.\n\nLet me try rearranging the mirror formula to solve for \\(f\\) directly:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{d_o \\times d_i}{d_o + d_i}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in \\(d_o = 10\\) cm and \\(d_i = -2\\) cm:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{10 \\times (-2)}{10 + (-2)} = \\frac{-20}{8} = -2.5 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nWhich is indeed \\(-\\frac{5}{2}\\) cm, confirming my earlier result.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. -5/2 cm.\n\nBut let's check if this makes sense in the context of the options provided.\n\nOption A is -3/5 cm, which is -0.6 cm, which is different from -2.5 cm.\n\nOption B is -5/3 cm, which is approximately -1.67 cm, still different.\n\nOption C is -2/5 cm, which is -0.4 cm, not matching.\n\nOption D is -5/2 cm, which is -2.5 cm, matching my calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. -5/2 cm.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe there's a mistake in the options or the problem setup. But assuming the problem is correctly stated, and based on the mirror formula, D seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different formula or concept I should consider for diverging mirrors, but I think the mirror formula is sufficient here.\n\nSo, I conclude that the answer is D. -5/2 cm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-\\dfrac{5}{2}\\ \\text{cm}} \\]"
