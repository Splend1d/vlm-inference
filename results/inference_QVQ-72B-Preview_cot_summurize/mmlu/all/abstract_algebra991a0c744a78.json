                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: I need to find all the zeros in the finite field Z_5 of the polynomial x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x. The options are A. 0, B. 1, C. 0,1, D. 0,4.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what it means to find zeros in a finite field. Z_5 is the integers modulo 5, so the elements are {0,1,2,3,4}, and all arithmetic is done modulo 5.\n\nSo, I need to plug in each of these values into the polynomial and see which ones make the polynomial equal to zero modulo 5.\n\nThe polynomial is x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x.\n\nLet me first try x = 0.\n\nP(0) = 0^5 + 3*0^3 + 0^2 + 2*0 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 mod 5.\n\nSo, x = 0 is a root.\n\nNext, x = 1.\n\nP(1) = 1^5 + 3*1^3 + 1^2 + 2*1 = 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 7 mod 5 is 2.\n\nSo, x = 1 is not a root.\n\nNow, x = 2.\n\nP(2) = 2^5 + 3*2^3 + 2^2 + 2*2 = 32 + 3*8 + 4 + 4 = 32 + 24 + 4 + 4.\n\nCalculating modulo 5:\n\n32 mod 5 is 2, 24 mod 5 is 4, 4 mod 5 is 4, 4 mod 5 is 4.\n\nSo, 2 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 14 mod 5 is 4.\n\nNot zero, so x = 2 is not a root.\n\nNext, x = 3.\n\nP(3) = 3^5 + 3*3^3 + 3^2 + 2*3 = 243 + 3*27 + 9 + 6.\n\n243 mod 5: 243 divided by 5 is 48*5=240, so 243-240=3.\n\n3*27 is 81, 81 mod 5: 16*5=80, so 1.\n\n9 mod 5 is 4.\n\n6 mod 5 is 1.\n\nSo, 3 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 9 mod 5 is 4.\n\nNot zero, so x = 3 is not a root.\n\nFinally, x = 4.\n\nP(4) = 4^5 + 3*4^3 + 4^2 + 2*4 = 1024 + 3*64 + 16 + 8.\n\n1024 mod 5: 200*5=1000, so 1024-1000=24, 24 mod 5 is 4.\n\n3*64 is 192, 192 mod 5: 38*5=190, so 192-190=2.\n\n16 mod 5 is 1.\n\n8 mod 5 is 3.\n\nSo, 4 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 10 mod 5 is 0.\n\nTherefore, x = 4 is a root.\n\nSo, the zeros are x = 0 and x = 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 0,4.\n\nWait a minute, but option C is 0,1, which we saw is incorrect because x=1 is not a root.\n\nOption B is 1, which is incorrect, and option A is 0, which is correct, but it's incomplete.\n\nSo, the complete correct answer should include both 0 and 4, which is option D.\n\nI think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
