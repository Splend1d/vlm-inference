                    "text": "Okay, so I have this question about memory. It's asking which type of memory is involved in recalling information that was acquired within the past few hours to days. The options are Working Memory, Sensory Memory, Long-term Memory, and Prospective Memory. I need to pick the correct one from these choices.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what each type of memory is responsible for.\n\nStarting with Working Memory: I think it's like the active part of our memory where we hold and manipulate information in the moment. It's kind of like the workspace of our minds. So, if I'm trying to remember a phone number long enough to dial it, that's working memory at work. But the question is about recalling information from the past few hours to days, which sounds more about storing information over time, not just manipulating it in the moment.\n\nNext is Sensory Memory. From what I remember, this is the very initial stage where our senses capture information from the environment. It's like a brief snapshot that fades quickly if it's not paid attention to. For example, when you look at something and then look away, you might still have a visual afterimage for a second or two. So, this is even shorter-term than what the question is asking about. It's more about immediate recall, not something from hours or days ago.\n\nThen there's Long-term Memory. This seems the most likely candidate. Long-term memory is where we store information for extended periods, from days to years. It's what allows us to remember facts, skills, and experiences over time. So, if I learned something yesterday or last week, I should be able to recall it now because it's been stored in my long-term memory.\n\nLastly, there's Prospective Memory. I'm not as familiar with this one, but I think it's about remembering to do something in the future. Like, remembering to go to a doctor's appointment next week or to pick up milk on the way home. It involves setting an intention to remember something that will happen in the future.\n\nGiven that, the question is about recalling information that was acquired within the past few hours to days. That sounds exactly like Long-term Memory because that's where we store information for more than just a few hours or days. Working Memory is more about current processing, Sensory Memory is about immediate sensations, and Prospective Memory is about future intentions.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should think of an example. Suppose I watched a movie last night and now, the next day, I'm trying to recall what happened in the movie. That recall is drawing from my long-term memory, right? It's not something I'm actively working on in the moment (working memory), nor is it a sensory impression from the movie (sensory memory), and it's not about remembering to do something in the future (prospective memory).\n\nAnother example: if I learned a new word yesterday and now I'm trying to recall its meaning, again, that's accessing my long-term memory.\n\nSo, based on these examples and my understanding of the different types of memory, I'm pretty confident that Long-term Memory is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any overlap or if another type of memory could also be involved in recalling information from a few hours to days ago. For instance, could Working Memory play a role in recalling past information?\n\nWell, Working Memory is involved in the process of recalling information from long-term memory, but it's not where the information is stored for long periods. So, when I'm trying to recall something from long-term memory, my working memory is used to hold and manipulate that information once it's retrieved, but the storage itself is in long-term memory.\n\nSimilarly, Sensory Memory is only involved in the initial capture of sensory information, not in storing it for hours or days.\n\nProspective Memory is specifically about remembering to perform an action in the future, which isn't directly related to recalling information from the past few hours to days.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is Long-term Memory.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can think about the duration each type of memory covers:\n\n- Sensory Memory: fractions of a second to a few seconds\n\n- Short-term Memory (Working Memory): up to about 30 seconds without rehearsal\n\n- Long-term Memory: from minutes to years\n\nGiven this, information acquired within the past few hours to days falls squarely into the Long-term Memory category.\n\nI don't think there's any confusion here; the answer should be C. Long-term Memory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Long-term}} \\]"
