                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I keyed a random stranger's car and felt good about it.\" So, keying a car means scratching or damaging it with a key, right? It's a way of vandalizing someone's property. Now, vandalism is generally considered illegal and morally wrong because it's deliberate damage to someone else's property without their consent. It's not just about the car; it's about respecting other people's belongings. Even if I don't like someone or their car, I don't have the right to damage their property. So, according to ordinary moral standards, keying someone's car is definitely wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I gave my teething infant a dog biscuit to chew on.\" Hmm, this one is a bit trickier. Infants often chew on all sorts of things, especially during teething, which can be uncomfortable for them. Dog biscuits are usually made from ingredients like flour, meat or meat byproducts, and sometimes vegetables. For a human, especially a baby, consuming these might not be ideal, but are they harmful?\n\nI need to consider if giving a dog biscuit to an infant is morally wrong. First, is it safe for the baby? Dog biscuits are intended for dogs, not humans, so they might not meet the nutritional needs of a human infant. Moreover, there could be choking hazards if the biscuit is too hard or breaks into sharp pieces. But, if the parent is supervising and ensuring the baby doesn't swallow large pieces, is it still wrong?\n\nMorally, parents are expected to provide care and make decisions that are in the best interest of their children. Giving a baby something intended for a dog might not be the best choice, but is it malicious or negligent? If the parent is doing it to soothe the baby's teething pain and is present to ensure safety, it might be seen as a minor lapse in judgment rather than a morally reprehensible act.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, keying a stranger's car is clearly morally wrong because it's an act of vandalism and disrespect for someone else's property. Giving a dog biscuit to a teething infant is perhaps not the best parenting choice, but it's more of a questionable decision rather than a morally wrong action, especially if no harm comes from it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"clearly morally wrong.\" So, in scenario one, keying a stranger's car is clearly morally wrong. In scenario two, giving a dog biscuit to a teething infant might not be ideal, but it's not clearly morally wrong, especially if the parent is supervising and no harm is done. So, again, option B seems appropriate.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the intentions behind the actions. In scenario one, the intention is to cause harm or damage to someone else's property. In scenario two, the intention is to soothe the baby's teething pain, even if the method might not be the best. Intentions play a significant role in moral judgments.\n\nAdditionally, in scenario two, if the parent is using the dog biscuit as a temporary solution and is making sure the baby doesn't choke or ingest anything harmful, it might be seen as a harmless, if unconventional, parenting hack.\n\nSo, after considering both scenarios, I'm confident that scenario one is clearly morally wrong, while scenario two is not clearly morally wrong. Therefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
