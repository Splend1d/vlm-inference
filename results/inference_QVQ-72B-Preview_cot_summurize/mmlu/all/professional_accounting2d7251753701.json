                    "text": "So I need to figure out Carter's working capital at the end of the current year. From the information given, I have various assets and some liabilities. First, I should recall what working capital is. I think working capital is basically the money a company has to cover its short-term obligations. More specifically, it's the difference between a company's current assets and its current liabilities.\n\nSo, working capital = current assets - current liabilities.\n\nI see that current liabilities are given as $640,000. Now, I need to identify which of these assets are current assets.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- Cash and cash equivalents: $200,000\n\n- Short-term investments: $100,000\n\n- Accounts receivable: $400,000\n\n- Inventories: $600,000\n\n- Patent - 10 years: $300,000\n\n- Equipment: $1,000,000\n\n- Accumulated depreciation: $200,000\n\nI know that current assets are those that can be converted into cash within one year or less. So, cash and cash equivalents are definitely current assets. Short-term investments are also likely to be current assets since they're probably convertible to cash within a year. Accounts receivable are amounts expected to be received in cash within a short period, so they're current assets too. Inventories are current assets because they're intended for sale in the ordinary course of business.\n\nNow, the patent is for 10 years, which is longer than a year, so that's probably a long-term asset. Similarly, equipment is a fixed asset, and accumulated depreciation is a contra-asset related to equipment, reducing its book value.\n\nSo, current assets would be the sum of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and inventories.\n\nLet me add those up:\n\nCash and cash equivalents: $200,000\n\nShort-term investments: $100,000\n\nAccounts receivable: $400,000\n\nInventories: $600,000\n\nTotal current assets: $200,000 + $100,000 + $400,000 + $600,000 = $1,300,000\n\nThen, current liabilities are $640,000.\n\nSo, working capital = $1,300,000 - $640,000 = $660,000\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $60,000\n\nB. $560,000\n\nC. $660,000\n\nD. $960,000\n\nIt seems like option C is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, confirming what constitutes current assets:\n\n- Cash and cash equivalents: yes\n\n- Short-term investments: yes\n\n- Accounts receivable: yes\n\n- Inventories: yes\n\n- Patent: no, it's long-term\n\n- Equipment: no, it's a fixed asset\n\n- Accumulated depreciation: no, it's a contra-asset related to equipment\n\nSo, total current assets are indeed $1,300,000.\n\nSubtracting current liabilities of $640,000 gives $660,000.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes, people might consider including the patent or other non-current assets in the calculation, but that's not correct because working capital is specifically about current assets and current liabilities.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is $660,000, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
