                    "text": "So I have this problem here: the population of a certain city is 836,527. I need to round this number to the nearest ten thousand. The options are A. 800,000, B. 830,000, C. 836,000, and D. 840,000.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to round to the nearest ten thousand. Basically, I'm looking at the ten thousands place in the number and deciding whether to keep it the same or round up based on the digits that follow.\n\nLet me write down the number to see it clearly:\n\n836,527\n\nOkay, so the number is eight hundred thirty-six thousand five hundred twenty-seven.\n\nNow, to round to the nearest ten thousand, I need to look at the ten thousands digit. In this number, the ten thousands digit is 3 (since 8 is in the hundred thousands place, 3 is in the ten thousands place).\n\nSo, the number is 830,000 plus 6,527.\n\nNow, I need to decide whether to round up or down. To make that decision, I look at the digits after the ten thousands place. In this case, that's the thousands digit, which is 6.\n\nI recall that if the digit to the right of the place I'm rounding to is 5 or greater, I should round up. If it's less than 5, I should round down.\n\nHere, the thousands digit is 6, which is greater than 5. So, I should round up.\n\nTherefore, the population rounded to the nearest ten thousand should be 840,000.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think about it differently. Perhaps I can consider the range within which the exact number lies.\n\nThe ten thousands place is 3, and the next digit is 6. So, since 6 is greater than or equal to 5, I add one to the ten thousands digit and drop all the digits that follow.\n\nSo, 836,527 rounded to the nearest ten thousand is 840,000.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the midpoint between 830,000 and 840,000. The midpoint would be 835,000. Since the actual population is 836,527, which is above 835,000, it should be rounded up to 840,000.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nLet me see what the other options are:\n\nA. 800,000 \u2013 that's the nearest hundred thousand down, not appropriate here.\n\nB. 830,000 \u2013 that's the nearest ten thousand down, but since the thousands digit is 6, which is greater than 5, we should round up.\n\nC. 836,000 \u2013 that's the nearest thousand, I think, but the question asks for the nearest ten thousand.\n\nD. 840,000 \u2013 that's my answer.\n\nSo, I think D. 840,000 is the correct choice.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Maybe I can visualize the number line.\n\nFrom 800,000 to 900,000, the ten thousands are: 800,000, 810,000, 820,000, 830,000, 840,000, 850,000, 860,000, 870,000, 880,000, 890,000, 900,000.\n\nNow, 836,527 falls between 830,000 and 840,000. To find out which one it's closer to, I can see how far it is from each.\n\nThe difference from 836,527 to 830,000 is 6,527.\n\nThe difference from 836,527 to 840,000 is 3,473.\n\nSince 3,473 is less than 6,527, it's closer to 840,000.\n\nAlternatively, as I thought before, the midpoint between 830,000 and 840,000 is 835,000. Since 836,527 is above 835,000, it should be rounded up to 840,000.\n\nI think this confirms my initial answer.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the place value. The ten thousands place is the fourth digit from the right (or the second from the left, starting from the left).\n\nIn 836,527, the digits are:\n\n8 - hundred thousands\n\n3 - ten thousands\n\n6 - thousands\n\n5 - hundreds\n\n2 - tens\n\n7 - units\n\nSo, rounding to the nearest ten thousand means looking at the thousands digit, which is 6. Since 6 is greater than or equal to 5, we round up the ten thousands digit, which is 3, to 4.\n\nThus, 836,527 becomes 840,000 when rounded to the nearest ten thousand.\n\nI can also use the standard rounding rule: look at the digit to the right of the place you're rounding to. If it's 5 or more, round up; if it's less than 5, round down.\n\nIn this case, the digit to the right of the ten thousands place is 6, which is more than 5, so we round up.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 840,000.\n\nI think I've covered multiple ways to approach this problem, and all of them lead me to the same conclusion.\n\nSo, the final answer is D. 840,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 840000} \\]"
