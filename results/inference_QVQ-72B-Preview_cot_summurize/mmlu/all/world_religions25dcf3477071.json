John, Luke, Mark. Hmm, I need to figure out which group of Gospels are considered the synoptic Gospels.\n\nI remember that the term \"synoptic\" comes from a Greek word that means \"to see together.\" So, the synoptic Gospels are the ones that present a similar viewpoint and often share a lot of the same stories and teachings. I think there are three Gospels that are usually grouped together as synoptic.\n\nLet me see... I know that Matthew, Mark, and Luke are often referred to as the synoptic Gospels. They have a lot in common in terms of structure and content. For example, they all include stories about Jesus' birth, his ministry, miracles, teachings, and his crucifixion and resurrection.\n\nOn the other hand, the Gospel of John is different. It has its own unique style and includes different stories and teachings that aren't found in the other three. So, I don't think John is considered one of the synoptic Gospels.\n\nOption A mentions Peter, but wait, there's no Gospel according to Peter in the New Testament. The Gospels are Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. So, that can't be right.\n\nOption B lists Matthew, Mark, and John. I know that Matthew, Mark, and Luke are the synoptic Gospels, so this seems incorrect because it includes John instead of Luke.\n\nOption C is Matthew, Mark, and Luke. That sounds familiar. This seems like the correct answer.\n\nOption D is John, Luke, and Mark. Again, since John isn't part of the synoptic Gospels, this can't be right.\n\nSo, based on what I know, the correct answer should be C. Matthew, Mark, and Luke. These are the synoptic Gospels because they share a lot of common material and have a similar structure, whereas John presents a different perspective and less overlapping content.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check a few points. First, I recall that the synoptic Gospels are so named because they can be easily compared or viewed together due to their similarities. They follow a chronological order and include many of the same events and sayings of Jesus.\n\nIn contrast, the Gospel of John is more thematic and emphasizes different aspects of Jesus' life and teachings. It includes unique stories like the raising of Lazarus and the wedding at Cana, which aren't found in the synoptic Gospels.\n\nAlso, the synoptic Gospels often have parallel accounts of the same event, sometimes worded almost identically, suggesting that they might have drawn from common sources or traditions.\n\nAnother thing I remember is that the Gospel of Mark is believed to be the earliest of the four Gospels, and both Matthew and Luke likely used Mark as a source, along with other materials like the so-called \"Q\" source, which is a hypothetical collection of sayings of Jesus.\n\nGiven all this, it's clear that Matthew, Mark, and Luke are the synoptic Gospels, while John stands apart with its distinct style and content.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. Matthew, Mark, and Luke.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
