                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what utilitarianism is all about. It's one of those philosophical principles that I've heard of, but I never really delved into it. From the options given, I need to pick the one that best defines utilitarianism. Let's see:\n\nOption A says it's about equality for everyone. Hmm, that sounds nice, but I think utilitarianism is more about happiness or well-being rather than equality per se. Maybe equality is a means to an end, but it doesn't seem like the core principle.\n\nOption B mentions maximizing outcomes for individuals. This seems a bit vague. Maximizing what exactly? Happiness? Resources? And is it about individuals or the majority? I need to think more about this.\n\nOption C states the best outcome for the majority of people. This seems plausible. Utilitarianism often talks about the greatest good for the greatest number. So, it's about maximizing happiness or utility for most people.\n\nOption D talks about the least worst outcome for everybody. That's interesting. It suggests a focus on minimizing harm or dissatisfaction across all individuals. But does utilitarianism prioritize the least worst outcome, or is it more about maximizing the best possible outcomes?\n\nLet me think about this. Utilitarianism is a form of consequentialism, meaning that the morality of an action is determined by its consequences. Specifically, it's concerned with maximizing utility, which is usually defined as happiness or well-being.\n\nSo, between options C and D, it seems like option C aligns more closely with what I know about utilitarianism. It's about achieving the best outcome for the majority, even if that means some individuals might not get the best possible outcome.\n\nBut wait, utilitarianism also considers the utility of all affected parties, not just the majority. So, perhaps it's not just about the majority but about the total sum of utility. In that case, sometimes sacrificing the utility of a few might be justified if it significantly increases the utility of many others.\n\nI recall that there are different types of utilitarianism. Act utilitarianism considers each action individually and chooses the one that maximizes utility, while rule utilitarianism follows general rules that tend to maximize utility over time.\n\nGiven that, option C seems to align more with act utilitarianism, focusing on the specific outcome that benefits the majority in a particular situation.\n\nOption D, on the other hand, suggests a focus on minimizing negative outcomes for everyone. This could be related to the principle of minimizing harm, which is also important in utilitarianism, but it might not capture the full picture.\n\nWait a minute, maybe both maximizing positive outcomes and minimizing negative outcomes are important in utilitarianism. Perhaps the best definition would include both aspects.\n\nLet me consider that. If utilitarianism is about maximizing overall utility, which is typically interpreted as happiness or pleasure minus suffering or pain, then both increasing positive experiences and decreasing negative ones are part of the equation.\n\nHowever, among the given options, option C seems to capture the essence of maximizing positive outcomes for the majority, which is a central tenet of utilitarianism.\n\nOption B, \"maximization of outcomes for individuals,\" is too broad and doesn't specify whether it's for the majority or all individuals. Utilitarianism is more nuanced than that; it's not just about maximizing outcomes for some individuals but considering the overall utility.\n\nOption A, \"equality for everyone,\" doesn't directly relate to utilitarianism's focus on utility maximization. While some utilitarians might advocate for equality as a means to maximize utility, it's not the defining principle of utilitarianism.\n\nOption D, \"the least worst outcome for everybody,\" emphasizes minimizing negative outcomes for all individuals. While this is a aspect of utilitarianism, it doesn't capture the full scope of maximizing overall utility.\n\nTherefore, based on my understanding, option C, \"the best outcome for the majority of people,\" is the most accurate definition of utilitarianism among the provided choices.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check a standard definition of utilitarianism. According to classical utilitarianism, especially as proposed by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, the principle is to achieve the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.\n\nThis aligns closely with option C. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
