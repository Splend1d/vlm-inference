                    "text": "Alright, I've got this passage from Jane Addams' \"Twenty Years at Hull House.\" It's about a meeting at Hull House during a strike in a shoe factory. The discussion was about how some strikers were easily frightened, especially those who were paying board and were afraid of being evicted if they fell behind on payments. Then, one of them suggests having their own boarding club so they could support each other during tough times like strikes.\n\nSo, Hull House and the settlement helped set up this boarding club by renting and furnishing apartments, and after a couple of years, the club grew to occupy six apartments and had fifty members. It seems like a community-driven initiative to support working women, especially during times of strikes or financial hardships.\n\nNow, the question is asking which political goal this perspective would most directly support: women's suffrage, trust-busting, greater rights for unions, or weakening political machines.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, the passage is about working women coming together to support each other during a strike. A strike is typically associated with labor unions, which are groups of workers who band together to negotiate better wages, hours, and working conditions with employers.\n\nSo, the fact that these women are striking suggests they're part of a union or at least engaging in union-like activities.\n\nThe boarding club they set up helps them stand together during strikes, which implies that having such support systems allows them to be more resilient in their demands for better working conditions or pay.\n\nNow, considering this background, which of the options aligns best with the theme of the passage?\n\nOption A is women's suffrage, which is about giving women the right to vote. While certainly an important goal in the progressive era, the passage is more directly related to labor rights and mutual support among working women rather than specifically about voting rights.\n\nOption B is trust-busting. Trusts are large corporations that control a significant portion of a particular industry, often accused of monopolistic practices. While the progressive movement did advocate for breaking up trusts to promote competition and prevent abuse of market power, the passage doesn't directly address large corporations or monopolies. It's focused on the day-to-day struggles of working women and their community support systems.\n\nOption C is greater rights for unions. This seems quite relevant because the strike mentioned in the passage is a union activity. The boarding club helps strikers withstand financial pressures during a strike, which in turn strengthens their position in negotiating with employers. So, this initiative supports the union's ability to operate effectively and stand up for workers' rights.\n\nOption D is weakening political machines. Political machines were organizations that controlled politics in certain areas, often accused of corruption and exploiting immigrant communities. While Hull House and other settlements did work against such machines by empowering communities and promoting reform, the passage doesn't directly address political machines. It's more about economic support and labor rights.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C\u2014greater rights for unions\u2014seems to be the most directly supported by the perspective in the passage. The story highlights how community support, like the boarding club, empowers workers to engage in collective action and withstand the challenges of striking for better working conditions.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a broader context I'm missing.\n\nJane Addams was a prominent figure in the progressive movement, known for her work at Hull House in Chicago, which was a settlement house that provided services and support to immigrant and working-class families. Hull House was involved in various reform efforts, including labor rights, women's suffrage, and social justice issues.\n\nIn this particular passage, the focus is on supporting working women during a strike, which is directly related to labor union activities. The establishment of the boarding club is a practical measure to sustain strikers financially and emotionally, thereby strengthening the union's position.\n\nWhile Hull House did advocate for women's suffrage and other reforms, the immediate context here is labor support and union strength.\n\nTherefore, the perspective of the passage would most directly support greater rights for unions.\n\nI think the answer is C. Greater rights for unions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
