                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out whether the trial court is likely to grant the suppression motion for the cocaine found in the car. Let me try to understand what's going on step by step.\n\nFirst, the driver was stopped for speeding and found to have a suspended license. The officer let her husband drive the car home but arrested her for driving under suspension. So, she's arrested and secured in the squad car. Then, the officer searches her vehicle and finds a bag of cocaine in a zippered jacket on the back seat. Based on that, she's also arrested for possession and intent to deliver a controlled substance.\n\nNow, before trial, she's moved to suppress the cocaine. I need to decide which option is correct: whether the court will grant or deny the suppression motion.\n\nOption A says yes, it must be suppressed because she was secured in the squad car, and the police couldn't expect to find evidence relating to the current arrest in the car.\n\nOption B says no, the motion will be denied because there's no expectation of privacy toward property inside one's car.\n\nOption C says no, the motion will be denied because this was a valid search incident to an arrest.\n\nOption D says yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to recall the rules about searching vehicles and when evidence can be suppressed.\n\nFirst, I know that the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. So, generally, searches require a warrant, but there are exceptions.\n\nOne common exception is the search incident to a lawful arrest. I think this allows officers to search the area within the immediate control of the arrestee to ensure officer safety and prevent evidence destruction.\n\nBut in this case, the driver was already secured in the squad car, so she wasn't in a position to access the car or destroy evidence. That might affect whether the search incident to arrest exception applies.\n\nLet me think about the Supreme Court cases related to this. I recall that in New York v. Belton (1981), the Court held that when a person is arrested in a vehicle, the police may search the passenger compartment without a warrant. But later, in Arizona v. Gant (2009), the Court refined this rule.\n\nIn Gant, the Court said that officers can search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant's arrest only if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search or it's reasonable to believe the vehicle holds evidence of the offense of arrest.\n\nIn this scenario, the driver was secured in the squad car, so she wasn't within reaching distance of the passenger compartment. Therefore, the search incident to arrest exception might not apply because there's no reasonable belief that the vehicle holds evidence of the offense of arrest.\n\nWait, but she was arrested for driving under suspension, and the officer found cocaine, which is a separate offense. So, perhaps the search was related to the new offense of possession.\n\nBut still, if the search was based on the initial arrest for driving under suspension, and she was already secured away from the vehicle, it might not be justified under the search incident to arrest doctrine.\n\nMaybe the officer had probable cause to believe that there was evidence of a crime in the car, which would allow a warrantless search. But I need to see if that's the case here.\n\nThe officer found the cocaine during the search, which led to the additional charges. But was there probable cause before the search to believe that evidence of a crime was in the car?\n\nThe initial stop was for speeding and suspended license, which are regulatory offenses, not necessarily related to drugs.\n\nUnless there was some other information or observation that led the officer to suspect there might be drugs in the car, I'm not sure there was probable cause for a warrantless search.\n\nOption D mentions that a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances. Exigent circumstances might include the risk of evidence destruction or immediate danger to officer safety.\n\nIn this case, since the driver was already secured in the squad car, there doesn't seem to be an immediate risk of evidence destruction or officer safety.\n\nTherefore, it seems like the search might have been unlawful because there wasn't a warrant and no applicable exception allowing a warrantless search.\n\nIf that's the case, then the cocaine should be suppressed under the exclusionary rule, which prevents illegally obtained evidence from being used in court.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, it seems like the trial court might grant the suppression motion.\n\nBut let's look at each option again to make sure.\n\nOption A says yes, it must be suppressed because she was secured in the squad car, and the police couldn't expect to find evidence relating to the current arrest in the car.\n\nThis seems to align with the Gant decision I mentioned earlier. Since she was secured and not within reaching distance, and there's no indication that the vehicle held evidence of the offense of arrest, the search might not be justified.\n\nOption B says no, the motion will be denied because there's no expectation of privacy toward property inside one's car.\n\nI know that generally, there is an expectation of privacy in one's vehicle, but the Fourth Amendment allows for greater leeway in searching vehicles due to their mobility.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean there's no expectation of privacy. The expectation is just less than in a home, for example.\n\nSo, this option seems overly broad and not directly applicable to the situation.\n\nOption C says no, the motion will be denied because this was a valid search incident to an arrest.\n\nBut based on my earlier analysis, it's not clear that the search incident to arrest exception applies here because the arrestee was secured away from the vehicle and there's no indication that the vehicle held evidence of the offense of arrest.\n\nOption D says yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.\n\nThis seems similar to Option A but emphasizes the warrant requirement and exigent circumstances.\n\nGiven that the driver was secured and there doesn't seem to be an immediate need to search the car without a warrant, this option also suggests that the search was invalid and the evidence should be suppressed.\n\nBetween Options A and D, I need to decide which one is more accurate.\n\nOption A seems to provide a specific reason based on the arrest and the securoty of the driver, while Option D refers to the general rule about searching vehicles.\n\nPerhaps both could be correct, but I have to choose one.\n\nI think Option A is more directly applicable to the scenario because it refers to the specific circumstances of the arrest and the driver being secured in the squad car.\n\nTherefore, I would say that Option A is the most accurate.\n\nSo, the trial court is likely to grant the suppression motion because the driver was secured in the squad car, and the police couldn't expect to find evidence relating to the current arrest in the car.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
