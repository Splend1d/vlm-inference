                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about unions and how they increase wages. There are four options, and I need to pick the one that's not a method unions use to raise wages. The options are:\n\nA. Negotiations to obtain a wage floor\n\nB. Restrictive membership policies\n\nC. Efforts to decrease the prices of substitute resources\n\nD. Featherbeding or make-work rules\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, unions are organizations that represent workers and try to improve their wages, benefits, and working conditions. So, they use various methods to achieve these goals.\n\nOption A is about negotiating a wage floor. That sounds like something unions would do, right? They negotiate with employers to set a minimum wage for their members. So, that probably is a method they use.\n\nOption B is restrictive membership policies. Hmm, that seems a bit counterintuitive. If unions restrict their membership, doesn't that mean fewer workers are covered by their negotiations? But maybe by limiting membership, they can create a scarcity of labor, which could drive up wages for their members. So, perhaps this is a method they use, but it seems a bit indirect.\n\nOption C is efforts to decrease the prices of substitute resources. Substitute resources would be things that can replace the labor provided by union members. For example, if there's a machine that can do the work of a worker, that machine is a substitute resource. If unions try to decrease the price of these substitutes, would that help or hurt their members?\n\nWell, if substitute resources are cheaper, employers might be more inclined to use them instead of hiring union members. That could lead to less demand for union labor, which might result in lower wages or fewer job opportunities. So, this seems like it would not help unions increase wages. In fact, it might have the opposite effect.\n\nOption D is featherbeding or make-work rules. Featherbeding is when unions require employers to hire more workers than necessary or to pay for work that isn't actually done. Make-work rules are similar, where unnecessary work is created to keep workers employed. This seems like a way to create more jobs or ensure that union members have steady work, which could indirectly lead to higher wages if it means more hours or job security.\n\nBut is this directly increasing wages? It's more about job security and employment levels rather than the actual wage rate. So, maybe it's not the primary method for increasing wages, but it could be related.\n\nGiven all that, option C seems like the one that doesn't align with methods unions use to increase wages. Decreasing the prices of substitute resources would likely reduce the demand for union labor, leading to potential wage decreases rather than increases.\n\nSo, my answer would be C. Efforts to decrease the prices of substitute resources.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
