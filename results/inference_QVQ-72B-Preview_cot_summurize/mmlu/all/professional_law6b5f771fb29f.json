                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario about jury instructions in a federal negligence trial. The defendant proposed an instruction on contributory negligence, but the judge didn't include it in the final instructions to the jury. Neither party objected when the judge presented the instructions, and now the defendant wants to appeal based on the idea that the judge should have given the contributory negligence instruction. The question is whether the defendant has preserved this issue for appeal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to \"preserve\" an issue for appeal. Generally, in legal proceedings, you have to raise an issue at the trial level to preserve it for appeal. If you don't bring it up then, you can't complain about it later on appeal. There are some exceptions to this rule, especially in cases where fundamental errors occur, but for the most part, you need to object timely.\n\nIn the context of jury instructions, there are specific rules about when and how to object to the instructions. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51(d)(1) outlines that to preserve an objection to the failure to give an instruction, a party must object before the jury retires, stating distinctly the instruction desired and the grounds for the objection.\n\nSo, in this case, the defendant proposed an instruction on contributory negligence, but the judge didn't include it. Neither party objected after the judge informed them of the instructions she would give or after she actually gave them to the jury. The question is whether the defendant has preserved the issue by proposing the instruction.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge gave the instructions to the jury.\n\nB. No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give.\n\nC. Yes, because the defendant submitted a proposed instruction on contributory negligence.\n\nD. Yes, because the judge's failure to give the defendant's contributory negligence instruction amounted to a ruling on the instruction.\n\nI need to think about which of these is correct.\n\nFirst, proposing an instruction is an important step, but I don't think it's sufficient by itself to preserve an issue for appeal. The rules seem to require an objection to the failure to give the instruction, and that objection needs to be made before the jury retires.\n\nIn this scenario, the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give, and neither party objected at that time or after the instructions were given. So, it seems like the defendant didn't make the required objection.\n\nOption C suggests that proposing the instruction is enough to preserve the issue, but I don't think that's accurate based on the rules I recalled.\n\nOption D says that the judge's failure to give the instruction amounted to a ruling, which might be true, but I'm not sure if that alone preserves the issue without an objection.\n\nI think options A and B are more on track. Both mention the failure to object at specific times.\n\nOption A refers to failing to object after the judge gave the instructions to the jury, and option B refers to failing to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give.\n\nI need to check the federal rules to see when exactly the objection needs to be made.\n\nLooking at Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51(d)(1):\n\n\"(1) Before the jury retires for deliberation, a party may request that the court instruct the jury on the law. The party must state with particularity each matter objected to and the grounds for the objection. The court may instruct the jury before the parties rest.\"\n\nSo, it seems that objections to the failure to give an instruction must be made before the jury retires, and the party must state distinctly the instruction desired and the grounds for the objection.\n\nIn this case, the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give, and neither party objected at that time or after the instructions were given. So, it appears that the defendant did not make the required objection before the jury retired.\n\nTherefore, the issue wasn't preserved for appeal.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any exception that might apply here.\n\nIs there any possibility that proposing the instruction alone preserves the issue?\n\nI don't think so. Proposing an instruction is a necessary step to bring it to the court's attention, but without an objection to the court's failure to give it, the issue isn't preserved.\n\nWhat if the defendant thought the instruction was unnecessary or not applicable, but proposed it just in case? If they didn't object to its exclusion, it's hard to argue they preserved the issue.\n\nOption C seems too broad in suggesting that merely proposing an instruction preserves the issue without an objection.\n\nOption D says that the judge's failure to give the instruction amounted to a ruling on the instruction, which might be true, but again, without an objection to that ruling, the issue isn't preserved.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is either A or B.\n\nBut which one is more accurate?\n\nOption A refers to failing to object after the judge gave the instructions to the jury, while option B refers to failing to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give.\n\nI need to clarify when exactly the objection needs to be made.\n\nAccording to FRCP 51(d)(1), the objection must be made before the jury retires for deliberation, and the party must state distinctly the instruction desired and the grounds for the objection.\n\nIn practice, this usually means after the instructions are given but before the jury starts deliberating.\n\nIn this scenario, the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give, and then gave those instructions to the jury without including the defendant's proposed instruction on contributory negligence.\n\nNeither party objected either at the time the judge informed them of the instructions or after she gave them to the jury.\n\nTherefore, the defendant failed to object at the appropriate time, which was before the jury retired for deliberation.\n\nGiven that, option A seems to be the most accurate.\n\nOption B mentions failing to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give.\n\nWhile informing the parties of the instructions is an important step, the critical time for objection is after the instructions are given to the jury but before the jury retires for deliberation.\n\nSo, if the defendant didn't object at that time, the issue isn't preserved.\n\nTherefore, I think option A is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any difference between objecting after being informed of the instructions and objecting after the instructions are given to the jury.\n\nIn some courts, the procedure is to inform the parties of the instructions in advance, allow them to object, and then give the final instructions to the jury.\n\nIf that's the case, and the defendant didn't object at that point, they might have waived their right to object later.\n\nHowever, FRCP 51(d)(1) clearly states that objections must be made before the jury retires, and they must be distinct and state the grounds.\n\nSo, even if the defendant didn't object when the judge informed them of the instructions, they still had the opportunity to object after the instructions were given to the jury but before deliberation.\n\nIf they didn't object then, that's when the issue is waived.\n\nTherefore, option A seems to be the most accurate answer.\n\nOption B might be partially correct, but option A is more precise in referencing the time after the instructions were given to the jury.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nLet's consider if proposing an instruction is sufficient to preserve the issue without any objection.\n\nIn some contexts, proposing an instruction might be enough, but I don't think that's generally the case.\n\nThe purpose of objections is to give the court a chance to correct any errors before the trial concludes, and to create a clear record for appeal.\n\nWithout an objection, the issue is typically deemed waived.\n\nThere are exceptions, such as plain error, where an appellate court might consider an issue not preserved if it's a fundamental error that affects the party's substantial rights.\n\nBut that's not the same as preserving the issue; it's a separate doctrine.\n\nSo, in this scenario, since the defendant didn't object to the absence of the contributory negligence instruction, the issue wasn't preserved, and the defendant would have to rely on plain error review on appeal, which is much more limited.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge gave the instructions to the jury.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
