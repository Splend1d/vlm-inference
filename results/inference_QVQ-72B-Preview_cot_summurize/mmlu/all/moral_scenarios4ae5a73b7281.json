                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, first wrong and second not wrong, first not wrong and second wrong, or neither is wrong. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I took a cab home after drinking 3 bottles of wine at the winery.\" So, someone drank three bottles of wine at a winery and then took a cab home instead of driving themselves. Now, drinking and driving is really dangerous and against the law because it can cause accidents and harm to others. But in this case, the person didn't drive; they took a cab home. That seems responsible, right? They made a safe choice to get home without risking others' safety.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Drinking three bottles of wine is a lot. Was this person so drunk that they couldn't even remember to take a cab or call someone? But no, they did take a cab, which shows they were thinking about safety. So, in this scenario, taking a cab after drinking is actually a responsible decision, not morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I hit on her at the party.\" Hmm, \"hitting on\" someone usually means making sexual advances or trying to attract someone's attention in a romantic or sexual way. This can be tricky because it depends on the context and the other person's feelings. If both people are interested and comfortable with it, it's fine. But if one person is not interested or feels uncomfortable, it could be seen as inappropriate or even harassment.\n\nIn general, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, hitting on someone without their consent or without ensuring they're comfortable with it could be considered morally wrong. It's important to respect other people's boundaries and consent in social interactions, especially those involving romantic or sexual advances.\n\nSo, in Scenario 1, taking a cab after drinking is not morally wrong because it's a responsible choice for safety. In Scenario 2, hitting on someone at a party could be morally wrong if it involves disrespecting the other person's boundaries or consent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong...\" and the options are labeled A through D. Option C is \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which matches my conclusion.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps there's a cultural or contextual aspect I'm missing. For example, in some cultures or settings, hitting on someone might not be seen as morally wrong, but according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, respecting personal boundaries and consent is emphasized.\n\nAlso, in Scenario 1, even though taking a cab after drinking is responsible, maybe there's a argument that drinking to excess is irresponsible. But the scenario specifies that the person drank three bottles of wine, which is a lot, but they still made the right choice to not drive. So, overall, their action of taking a cab is not morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, without more context, it's hard to be certain, but generally, hitting on someone without their consent is considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
