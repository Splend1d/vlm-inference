                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: a 100-kg crate is hoisted 2 meters in 4 seconds, and I need to find out how much work is done on it. The options are 200 J, 500 J, 800 J, and 2000 J.\n\nFirst off, I remember that work is related to force and distance. There's a formula: work equals force times distance, right? But wait, that's for when the force is constant and in the direction of motion. In this case, the crate is being hoisted, which probably means it's being lifted straight up against gravity.\n\nSo, the force needed to lift it should be equal to its weight, which is the force due to gravity acting on its mass. I know that weight is mass times gravity, so W = m * g.\n\nGiven that, the weight of the crate would be 100 kg times 9.81 m/s\u00b2, which is about 981 N.\n\nNow, the work done in lifting it 2 meters would be the force times the distance, so W = 981 N * 2 m = 1962 J.\n\nLooking at the options, none of them exactly match 1962 J, but 2000 J is the closest among the choices.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe the time factor comes into play here. The crate is hoisted 2 meters in 4 seconds, but is that relevant for calculating work done against gravity?\n\nI think work done against gravity only depends on the mass, the acceleration due to gravity, and the height lifted, not on the time it takes. Unless there's some other force involved, but the problem doesn't mention any.\n\nLet me double-check that. If I'm just lifting a crate vertically at a constant speed, the work done should indeed be only the force times the distance, ignoring any kinetic energy changes.\n\nBut maybe I need to consider the power, which is work per unit time. Power is related to the rate at which work is done. The unit for power is the watt, which is joules per second.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the time factor could influence the work calculation, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, work is just force times distance, regardless of how fast it's done, unless efficiency is a factor, which it's not here.\n\nI think the time given might be just to distract, and the actual work done is simply the weight times the height lifted.\n\nSo, 981 N times 2 m is 1962 J, which rounds to 2000 J. So, option D seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want me to use a different approach, like calculating the potential energy gained by the crate when lifted to that height.\n\nPotential energy is m * g * h, which is the same as the work done to lift it, assuming no other forces are doing work.\n\nSo, again, that's 100 kg * 9.81 m/s\u00b2 * 2 m = 1962 J, which rounds to 2000 J.\n\nLooking back at the options, 2000 J is option D.\n\nUnless there's something tricky here, I think the answer is D. 2000 J.\n\nMaybe I should consider the units. Work is in joules, which is newtons times meters. So, yes, 981 N * 2 m = 1962 J, which is closest to 2000 J.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a need to consider the acceleration during lifting, but the problem states it's hoisted in 4 seconds, which might imply constant acceleration, but without more information, it's probably safe to assume constant speed for the purpose of this problem.\n\nTherefore, the work done is simply the weight times the height, which is 1962 J, rounding to 2000 J.\n\nSo, the answer is D. 2000 J.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
