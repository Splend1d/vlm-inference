                    "text": "So I need to figure out what percentage of the world population lived in extreme poverty in 2019, defined as less than $1.90 a day. The options are 5%, 10%, 15%, or 25%. Hmm, I think I've heard something about this before, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nFirst, I should probably look up some data on global poverty levels. I recall that the World Bank tracks poverty thresholds and provides statistics on this. Maybe I should check their website or look for reliable sources like the United Nations or other international organizations.\n\nLet me consider what I know: Extreme poverty is often referred to as living on less than $1.90 a day, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP). This measure helps compare living standards across different countries by accounting for local price levels.\n\nI think the percentage has been decreasing over the years due to economic growth and development efforts. For example, in 1990, it was around 36%, and by 2015, it had decreased to around 10%. So, considering that progress continues, maybe it's lower now.\n\nBut wait, the question specifies 2019. I should look for the most recent data available, preferably from 2019 or close to that year.\n\nLet me try to recall if there are any specific numbers I've come across recently. I think I saw a report that said the global extreme poverty rate was around 8.5% in 2019. But I'm not entirely sure if that's accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider regional data. For instance, in sub-Saharan Africa, extreme poverty rates are higher compared to other regions. But since the question is about the world population, I need a global figure.\n\nAnother approach could be to look at the number of people living in extreme poverty and compare it to the total world population. As of 2019, the world population was roughly 7.7 billion people. If I can find out how many people were living on less than $1.90 a day, I can calculate the percentage.\n\nI think I read somewhere that there were about 600 million people living in extreme poverty in 2019. So, if the total population was 7.7 billion, then 600 million divided by 7.7 billion would be roughly 7.79% or about 8%. That would suggest that the answer is 10%, but that's a bit of a guess.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm misremembering the numbers. Let me double-check. If the population is 7.7 billion and 600 million are in extreme poverty, that would indeed be approximately 7.79%, which rounds to 8%. So, 10% seems a closest option, but perhaps it's slightly lower.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of people in extreme poverty is higher. Some sources might say around 700 million, which would be about 9.09%, still closer to 10%.\n\nI should also consider that poverty estimates can vary depending on the data source and the methods used to calculate them. The World Bank might have slightly different figures.\n\nPerhaps I should look for more current data. I know that the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, which might have affected poverty levels, but since the question is about 2019, I should focus on pre-pandemic figures.\n\nLet me try to recall if there are any key reports or publications from around that time that might provide this information. The World Bank publishes regular updates on global poverty, so maybe I can recall some of their data.\n\nI think in their 2020 report, they might have included 2019 estimates. Alternatively, maybe I can look at their PovcalNet database or their website's data visualizations.\n\nIf I can't recall the exact number, perhaps I can think about trends. As I mentioned earlier, poverty has been decreasing over time, so it's likely that the percentage is lower than previous years.\n\nGiven that in 2015, it was around 10%, and considering the progress made between 2015 and 2019, it's plausible that it decreased slightly, but not by a large margin.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some regions might have seen increases in poverty due to conflicts, economic downturns, or other factors.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the distribution of wealth and income inequality. Even if the percentage of people in extreme poverty is decreasing, there might still be a significant number of people living just above the poverty line, facing similar challenges.\n\nBut again, the question specifically asks about extreme poverty, defined as less than $1.90 a day.\n\nMaybe I should think about the definitions and ensure I understand what constitutes extreme poverty.\n\nThe $1.90 threshold is based on the international poverty line, which is set by the World Bank. It's adjusted for purchasing power parity to account for differences in the cost of living across countries.\n\nThis means that in countries where the cost of living is lower, people can afford more with their income, and vice versa.\n\nGiven that, the percentage of people living below this line would vary significantly across countries.\n\nFor example, in high-income countries, the percentage is very low, almost negligible, while in low-income countries, it can be much higher.\n\nTherefore, the global average would be influenced by the population sizes and poverty rates of different regions.\n\nConsidering all this, I still believe that the closest estimate for 2019 is around 10%. While my initial calculation suggested 8%, that might have been an underestimation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct percentage is closer to 5%. But that seems too low, given that in 2015, it was around 10%, and I don't think poverty decreased by half in just four years.\n\nUnless there was significant progress in reducing poverty globally, which I doubt, given the persistent challenges many countries face.\n\nMoreover, I recall that some estimates put the extreme poverty rate at around 9% in 2019, which would still be closer to 10% than to 5%.\n\nGiven that, I think the best answer is B. 10%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
