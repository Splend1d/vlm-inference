Version 1 reads blocks of 1,000 bytes, and version 2 reads blocks of 4,000 bytes. We need to find the ratio of the time required to read a large file in version 2 compared to version 1.\n\nFirst, let's understand the time components for each file read operation:\n\n1. **Disk seek time**: 25 msec\n\n2. **Disk latency time**: 8 msec\n\n3. **Disk transfer time**: 1 msec per 1,000 bytes\n\n4. **Operating system overhead**: 1 msec per 1,000 bytes + 10 msec\n\nSince version 1 reads 1,000 bytes at a time, the disk transfer time and OS overhead per read are both 1 msec + 10 msec = 11 msec.\n\nTotal time per read in version 1:\n\n- Disk seek: 25 msec\n\n- Disk latency: 8 msec\n\n- Disk transfer: 1 msec\n\n- OS overhead: 11 msec\n\nTotal: 25 + 8 + 1 + 11 = 45 msec per 1,000 bytes\n\nFor version 2, which reads 4,000 bytes at a time:\n\nDisk transfer time: 1 msec per 1,000 bytes, so for 4,000 bytes, it's 4 msec\n\nOS overhead: 1 msec per 1,000 bytes, so for 4,000 bytes, it's 4 msec + 10 msec = 14 msec\n\nTotal time per read in version 2:\n\n- Disk seek: 25 msec\n\n- Disk latency: 8 msec\n\n- Disk transfer: 4 msec\n\n- OS overhead: 14 msec\n\nTotal: 25 + 8 + 4 + 14 = 51 msec per 4,000 bytes\n\nNow, to find the ratio for reading a large file, we need to consider how many reads are done in each version.\n\nLet's assume the large file size is \\( L \\) bytes.\n\nIn version 1, the number of reads is \\( \\frac{L}{1,000} \\), and total time is \\( 45 \\times \\frac{L}{1,000} \\) msec\n\nIn version 2, the number of reads is \\( \\frac{L}{4,000} \\), and total time is \\( 51 \\times \\frac{L}{4,000} \\) msec\n\nThe ratio of version 2 time to version 1 time is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{51 \\times \\frac{L}{4,000}}{45 \\times \\frac{L}{1,000}} = \\frac{51}{45} \\times \\frac{1,000}{4,000} = \\frac{51}{45} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{51}{180} \\approx 0.2833\n\\]\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately 0.2833:1, which is roughly 1:3.5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 1:3.5\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{B}\\]"
