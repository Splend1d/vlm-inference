                    "text": "So I have this problem here. Mai earns $5.50 per hour at her after-school job, and I need to figure out how many hours she has to work to earn $132. The options are 16, 20, 24, or 28 hours. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that earnings are equal to the hourly wage multiplied by the number of hours worked. So, if she earns $5.50 per hour, and she wants to earn $132, I can set up an equation to solve for the number of hours.\n\nLet me let h represent the number of hours she needs to work. So, the equation should be:\n\n5.50 * h = 132\n\nNow, I need to solve for h. To do that, I can divide both sides of the equation by 5.50.\n\nh = 132 / 5.50\n\nLet me calculate that. 132 divided by 5.50.\n\nWell, 5.50 times 20 is 110, and 132 minus 110 is 22. So, 5.50 times 4 is 22, which adds up to 132.\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n5.50 times 20 is indeed 110.\n\nThen, 5.50 times 4 is 22.\n\nSo, 20 plus 4 is 24 hours.\n\nTherefore, Mai needs to work 24 hours to earn $132.\n\nLet me just double-check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert $5.50 to cents to make the division easier. $5.50 is 550 cents, and $132 is 13,200 cents.\n\nSo, 13,200 divided by 550 should also give me the number of hours.\n\nLet's try that division: 13,200 / 550.\n\nFirst, 550 times 24 is 13,200. Yes, that checks out.\n\nSo, again, 24 hours is the answer.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any tax or other deductions, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I assume the entire $5.50 per hour goes towards earning the $132.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies \"after-school job,\" but I don't think that affects the calculation in any way.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the answer should be 24 hours.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 16\n\nB. 20\n\nC. 24\n\nD. 28\n\nSo, option C is 24.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 24.\n\nI feel confident about this.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
