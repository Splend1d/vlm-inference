                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find Lake's distributable net income for the year based on the given income and expense items. The items listed are:\n\n- Dividend income: $2,500\n\n- Taxable interest income: $2,000\n\n- Capital gains (allocable to corpus): $5,000\n\n- Accounting fees (allocable to income): ($500)\n\n- Trustee fees (allocable to income): ($750)\n\nFirst, I need to understand what distributable net income (DNI) is. Generally, for a trust, DNI is a measure of income that's potentially distributable to the beneficiaries and is important for tax purposes. It's not exactly the same as accounting net income or taxable income because it has specific rules for inclusion and deduction.\n\nFrom the items listed, there are both income items and expense items, and some items are specifically allocated to \"corpus\" or \"income.\" In trust accounting, corpus refers to the principal amount, while income refers to the earnings generated by the corpus.\n\nGiven that Lake Trust is a simple trust, I should recall that simple trusts have specific rules regarding distributions. Unlike complex trusts, simple trusts are required to distribute all of their income annually, and they cannot accumulate income. Additionally, simple trusts cannot deduct distributions when computing their taxable income.\n\nBut for the purpose of calculating DNI, I need to focus on the income and expenses that are allocable to income, as corpus items might be treated differently.\n\nLet me list out the income and expense items again:\n\n- Dividend income: $2,500\n\n- Taxable interest income: $2,000\n\n- Capital gains (allocable to corpus): $5,000\n\n- Accounting fees (allocable to income): ($500)\n\n- Trustee fees (allocable to income): ($750)\n\nFirst, I need to identify which of these items are included in DNI.\n\nDividend income and taxable interest income are both types of income that would likely be included in DNI.\n\nCapital gains are allocable to corpus, which means they are not part of the income distributed to beneficiaries. However, in some cases, capital gains can be included in DNI if the trust instrument allows for it. But since it's specified as allocable to corpus, I'll assume they're not included in DNI.\n\nAccounting fees and trustee fees are expenses allocable to income, which means they reduce the income available for distribution.\n\nSo, to calculate DNI, I should add up the income items allocable to income and subtract the expenses allocable to income.\n\nIncome items allocable to income:\n\n- Dividend income: $2,500\n\n- Taxable interest income: $2,000\n\nTotal income allocable to income: $2,500 + $2,000 = $4,500\n\nExpense items allocable to income:\n\n- Accounting fees: $500\n\n- Trustee fees: $750\n\nTotal expenses allocable to income: $500 + $750 = $1,250\n\nDNI = Total income allocable to income - Total expenses allocable to income\n\nDNI = $4,500 - $1,250 = $3,250\n\nWait a minute, that's $3,250, which matches option D. But let's double-check if there's anything I'm missing.\n\nIs there any other item that should be included in DNI? The capital gains are allocable to corpus, so they shouldn't be included in DNI unless specified otherwise by the trust instrument or tax law. In this problem, it's specified as allocable to corpus, so I think it's safe to exclude them.\n\nAlso, are there any deductions or adjustments that I need to make? For simple trusts, DNI is generally equal to the income that must be distributed, minus any expenses allocable to that income.\n\nSo, $3,250 seems correct based on the given information.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider whether the trustee fees or accounting fees are deductible for DNI purposes. In tax law, trustee fees are often deductible in computing DNI, and accounting fees might be as well, depending on how they're allocated.\n\nGiven that the problem specifies these fees are allocable to income, I think it's appropriate to subtract them from the income items to calculate DNI.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $3,250, which corresponds to option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3250} \\]"
