                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about residuals in a regression line. The equation is y equals negative 2.29 plus 1.70 times x, and there's a point with x equals 5 and y equals 6. I need to find the residual for this point. The options are 7.91, 6.21, 0.21, and negative 0.21.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what a residual is in the context of regression analysis. I think a residual is the difference between the observed value and the predicted value of y for a given x. So, if I have a point (x, y), the residual would be y minus the predicted y from the regression line.\n\nGiven that, I should first find the predicted y-value when x is 5 using the equation y equals negative 2.29 plus 1.70 times x.\n\nLet me plug in x equals 5 into the equation:\n\nPredicted y = -2.29 + 1.70 * 5\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 1.70 times 5 is 8.5.\n\nThen, -2.29 plus 8.5 is... let's see, negative 2.29 plus 8.5.\n\nWell, 8.5 minus 2.29 is 6.21.\n\nSo, predicted y is 6.21.\n\nNow, the observed y is 6.\n\nSo, the residual should be observed y minus predicted y, which is 6 minus 6.21.\n\nThat would be negative 0.21.\n\nWait, but one of the options is negative 0.21, which is D, and another option is 0.21, which is C.\n\nIs it y minus predicted y or predicted y minus y?\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\nIn statistics, the residual is typically defined as the difference between the observed value and the predicted value, which is y minus y-hat, where y-hat is the predicted y.\n\nSo, y - y-hat.\n\nIn this case, y is 6 and y-hat is 6.21.\n\nSo, 6 minus 6.21 is negative 0.21.\n\nTherefore, the residual is negative 0.21.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 7.91\n\nB. 6.21\n\nC. 0.21\n\nD. \u20130.21\n\nSo, D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might calculate the residual as predicted y minus observed y, but that's not standard. The standard definition is observed y minus predicted y.\n\nIf I calculate predicted y minus observed y, that would be 6.21 minus 6, which is 0.21, which is option C.\n\nBut I think the standard definition is y - y-hat, so negative 0.21 should be correct.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can think about what a residual represents. It represents how much the observed value differs from the predicted value. If the observed value is less than the predicted value, the residual should be negative, which makes sense here.\n\nSo, since the observed y is 6 and the predicted y is 6.21, the residual is indeed negative 0.21.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. \u20130.21.\n\nI don't think it's A, 7.91, because that seems too large compared to the values given.\n\nOption B is 6.21, which is the predicted y-value, not the residual.\n\nOption C is 0.21, which would be the difference if I subtracted the wrong way, but according to the standard definition, it should be negative.\n\nSo, I'm confident that D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-0.21} \\]"
