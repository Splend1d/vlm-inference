                    "text": "So I've got this equation here: y/4 = 8. I need to find out what y is. Let's see... the problem is asking for the value of y, and the options are 2, 4, 12, and 32. Hmm, I need to make sure I understand how to solve this.\n\nAlright, the equation is y divided by 4 equals 8. So, y/4 = 8. To find y, I need to get y by itself on one side of the equation. That means I should undo the division. Division is like the opposite of multiplication, right? So, if y is divided by 4, to get y by itself, I should do the opposite operation, which is multiplication.\n\nSo, I should multiply both sides of the equation by 4. Let's try that. Starting with y/4 = 8, I'll multiply both sides by 4. On the left side, y/4 times 4 should just be y, because the 4s cancel out. On the right side, 8 times 4 is 32. So, y = 32.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check. If I plug y = 32 back into the original equation, y/4 should equal 8. So, 32 divided by 4 is 8. Yeah, that checks out. So, y is 32.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way to think about this. Maybe I can use cross-multiplication or something. Although, since it's a simple fraction equal to a number, maybe that's overcomplicating it.\n\nAnother way could be to consider that y/4 = 8, and since 4 times 8 is 32, y must be 32. That seems straightforward too.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other operation that could lead to y being something else, but no, I don't think so. It's a straightforward equation without any tricks.\n\nLet me look at the options again: A. 2, B. 4, C. 12, D. 32. So, 32 is option D. I think that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's see what happens if I choose one of the other options and plug it back into the equation.\n\nFirst, option A: y = 2. So, 2/4 = 0.5, which is not equal to 8. So, that's not correct.\n\nOption B: y = 4. 4/4 = 1, which is not equal to 8.\n\nOption C: y = 12. 12/4 = 3, which is still not equal to 8.\n\nAnd option D: y = 32. 32/4 = 8, which matches the equation perfectly.\n\nSo, clearly, D is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've covered all possible ways to approach this problem, and each time, I end up with y = 32. So, I'm confident that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]"
