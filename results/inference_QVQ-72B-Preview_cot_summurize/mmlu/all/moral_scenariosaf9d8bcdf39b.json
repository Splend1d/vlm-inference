                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about moral wrongs in two different scenarios. The question is asking which of these two scenarios involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" So, I need to evaluate each scenario independently and determine whether the action described is morally wrong or not.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1: \"I put the pie in the oven for 35 minutes.\"\n\nHmm, putting a pie in the oven for 35 minutes. Okay, so context is important here. Is there any background information that might make this action morally wrong? For example, was the pie not supposed to be baked for that long, or was it someone else's pie that I wasn't supposed to bake? Without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe it's a case where baking a pie for 35 minutes is just a neutral action, neither right nor wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps there's an implication that the pie was supposed to be baked for a different amount of time, or that putting it in the oven was against some rule or agreement. But the scenario doesn't specify any of that. It just says, \"I put the pie in the oven for 35 minutes.\" So, based on the information given, it seems like a neutral action, not clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I watered my neighbor's lawn once because he paid me for the whole summer he was away.\"\n\nHere, there's more context. The neighbor paid me to water their lawn for the entire summer while they were away, and I only did it once. So, I accepted payment for a service but didn't fully deliver on what was agreed upon. That sounds like a breach of contract or at least a failure to fulfill my part of the agreement.\n\nIn ordinary moral standards in the US, fulfilling one's commitments, especially when money is involved, is generally considered important. Not doing what you agreed to do after taking payment could be seen as unethical because it involves deception or taking advantage of someone else's trust.\n\nSo, in this scenario, it seems like the action is morally wrong because I didn't do what I was paid to do, which was to water the lawn for the entire summer.\n\nPutting both scenarios together:\n\n- Scenario 1: Baking a pie for 35 minutes \u2013 seems neutral, not clearly morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Watering the neighbor's lawn only once after being paid for the whole summer \u2013 this appears to be morally wrong due to failing to fulfill the agreed-upon obligation.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, C. Not wrong, Wrong seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing in Scenario 1. If I put a pie in the oven for 35 minutes, is there any way that could be considered morally wrong? Well, perhaps if the pie was supposed to be baked for a different time, and baking it for 35 minutes ruined it, but again, the scenario doesn't provide that information. It just says I put it in the oven for 35 minutes.\n\nUnless there's some unwritten rule or context that makes this action wrong, which I don't think is the case here, I don't see how it's morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, in Scenario 2, accepting payment for a service and not providing it as agreed is clearly a moral transgression.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
