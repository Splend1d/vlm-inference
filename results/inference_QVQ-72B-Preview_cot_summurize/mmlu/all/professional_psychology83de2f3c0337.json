                    "text": "Let's see here. I'm trying to figure out which theory best predicts why the president's wage and bonus incentive program didn't increase employee motivation and satisfaction. The options are ERG theory, expectancy theory, equity theory, and two-factor theory. I need to recall what each of these theories is about and see which one would explain why financial incentives alone didn't work.\n\nFirst, ERG theory. I think it stands for Existence, Relatedness, and Growth needs. This theory suggests that people have three core needs: existence (basic material needs like salary), relatedness (need for relationships and social connections), and growth (need for personal development and achievement). According to this theory, if the lower-level needs aren't met, higher-level needs won't be satisfied. Maybe if the existence needs are already met, then increasing wages might not have much of an impact on motivation and satisfaction. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nNext, expectancy theory. I remember this is about how people are motivated by their expectations of achieving desired outcomes. It involves three relationships: effort-performance, performance-reward, and reward-personal goal. So, if employees don't believe that increased effort will lead to better performance, or that better performance will be rewarded, or that the rewards (like wages and bonuses) align with their personal goals, then financial incentives might not motivate them. Maybe in this case, the employees don't see a clear link between their effort and the rewards, or perhaps the rewards don't align with what they value. That could explain why the incentives didn't work.\n\nEquity theory is about how people compare their inputs and outputs with others' and feel motivated when they perceive fairness. If employees think that the wage and bonus system is unfair or that they're not being treated equitably compared to others, it could demotivate them. But in this scenario, the president instituted the program for all employees, so maybe equity isn't the issue here. Unless employees perceive some inequality in how the incentives are distributed, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nThen there's two-factor theory, also known as Herzberg's motivation-hygiene theory. This theory proposes that there are two sets of factors that influence job satisfaction and motivation: hygiene factors and motivators. Hygiene factors are things like salary, working conditions, and company policies, which, if inadequate, can lead to dissatisfaction, but even if they're good, they don't necessarily motivate employees. Motivators, on the other hand, like achievement, recognition, responsibility, and growth opportunities, are what truly motivate employees. According to this theory, increasing wages and bonuses (hygiene factors) might reduce dissatisfaction, but they won't increase motivation and satisfaction unless accompanied by improvements in the motivators.\n\nHmm, that seems to fit the scenario pretty well. The president only changed wages and bonuses, which are hygiene factors, and didn't address the motivators, so even if wages went up, motivation and satisfaction didn't increase because the true motivators weren't being addressed.\n\nLet me compare this with the other options. ERG theory suggests that once existence needs are met, increasing wages might not help because employees are seeking relatedness and growth. That makes sense too, but in two-factor theory, it's more about the distinction between hygiene and motivators.\n\nExpectancy theory focuses on the perceived link between effort, performance, and rewards, which might be a factor here, but it seems like the issue is more fundamental: even if employees get the rewards, they're not motivated because the rewards aren't addressing what truly motivates them.\n\nEquity theory might come into play if employees feel that the wage and bonus distribution is unfair, but again, the scenario doesn't indicate any inequality.\n\nI think two-factor theory is the most straightforward fit here because it directly states that hygiene factors like wages, while important for reducing dissatisfaction, don't actually motivate employees. To increase motivation and satisfaction, the president would need to focus on the motivators like achievement and recognition, not just on financial incentives.\n\nSo, my answer would be D. two-factor theory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
