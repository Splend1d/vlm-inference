Direct marketing. B. Personal selling. C. Sale promotions. D. Advertising.\"\n\nHmm, let's see. It's about interpersonal communications, right? So, that probably means one-on-one or face-to-face interactions. The goal is to develop positive feelings and stimulate behavior, maybe like encouraging someone to buy something or take some action.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Direct marketing: I think direct marketing involves targeting individual customers with personalized messages, maybe through mail or email. It can be interpersonal in a way, but it's often more about sending out information directly to customers rather than having a two-way conversation.\n\nB. Personal selling: This sounds like salespeople talking directly to customers, maybe explaining products, answering questions, and trying to close a sale. It's definitely interpersonal because it involves direct communication between people, and the aim is to build a relationship and persuade the customer to buy.\n\nC. Sale promotions: These are usually short-term incentives to encourage purchases, like discounts, buy-one-get-one-free offers, or contests. They might involve some communication, but it's not necessarily interpersonal in the sense of person-to-person interaction. It's more about offering a deal or incentive.\n\nD. Advertising: This is about creating messages to promote products or services through various media, like TV ads, billboards, or online ads. It's a way to communicate with a large audience at once, but it's not interpersonal because there's no direct interaction between the advertiser and the individual consumer.\n\nSo, based on this, personal selling seems to fit the description best. It's all about interpersonal communications, building relationships, and stimulating behavior through direct interaction.\n\nWait a minute, but direct marketing can also involve interpersonal elements, especially if it's customized emails or direct mail that feel personal. But still, it's more about sending information than having a conversation.\n\nAnd sale promotions might involve some interpersonal communication if, for example, a salesperson is explaining the promotion to a customer, but the promotion itself is more about the offer than the communication.\n\nAdvertising is mostly about broadcasting messages, not about interpersonal interactions.\n\nSo, yeah, I think personal selling is the most accurate answer here because it's primarily based on interpersonal communications between a salesperson and a customer, with the aim of developing a positive relationship and stimulating purchasing behavior.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. Interpersonal communications involve direct, usually face-to-face, interactions between individuals. Personal selling is precisely that \u2013 a salesperson interacting directly with a customer to discuss products, answer questions, and close sales. It's designed to build trust and positive feelings towards the product or brand, which can lead to purchases and potentially long-term customer relationships.\n\nDirect marketing, while personalized, is more about sending information and less about real-time interaction. Sale promotions are about offers and incentives, not necessarily about interpersonal communications. Advertising is about mass communication, not individual interactions.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. Personal selling.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Personal selling.}} \\]"
