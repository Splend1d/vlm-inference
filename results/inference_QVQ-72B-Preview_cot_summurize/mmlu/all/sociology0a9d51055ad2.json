                    "text": "So I've got this question about the New Labour government's education policies. I need to figure out which one they didn't pursue. The options are:\n\nA. Setting and streaming pupils by ability\n\nB. Parental choice of school\n\nC. Supporting LEAs that appeared to be failing\n\nD. State regulation and control of the curriculum\n\nFirst, I need to recall what New Labour stood for in education. I know that New Labour, under Tony Blair, came to power in the UK in 1997. They were known for their \"Third Way\" approach, which combined elements of both conservative and progressive policies.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Setting and streaming pupils by ability.\n\nI remember that setting involves grouping students by ability within classrooms for certain subjects, like math or English. Streaming is more about dividing entire classes based on ability. New Labour did promote setting in subjects like math and English, arguing that it helped tailor teaching to students' needs. So, I think they did pursue this policy.\n\nOption B: Parental choice of school.\n\nThis is about allowing parents to choose which school their children attend, often beyond just their local school. New Labour expanded parental choice by introducing initiatives like the Parent's Charter and encouraging the establishment of new types of schools, like academy schools, which parents could choose from. So, I believe they did support parental choice.\n\nOption C: Supporting LEAs that appeared to be failing.\n\nLEAs stand for Local Education Authorities. These are the local government bodies responsible for education in their areas. Now, New Labour did implement reforms to improve underperforming schools and LEAs. They introduced interventions like the Fresh Start program for failing schools and the Excellence in Cities initiative to improve education in urban areas. However, I recall that they also took steps to replace or restructure LEAs that were not performing well. So, while they did intervene in failing LEAs, I'm not sure if they always supported them in the traditional sense. Maybe this could be a possible answer, but let me check further.\n\nOption D: State regulation and control of the curriculum.\n\nNew Labour was known for increasing central control over the education system. They built upon the National Curriculum, which was introduced by the previous Conservative government, and added more detailed guidelines and targets. They also introduced the Key Stage Tests and the SATs (Standard Assessment Tests) to monitor student progress. So, they definitely strengthened state regulation and control of the curriculum.\n\nLet me summarize what I've thought so far:\n\n- A: They did promote setting and streaming.\n\n- B: They expanded parental choice.\n\n- C: They intervened in failing LEAs, sometimes replacing them.\n\n- D: They increased state control over the curriculum.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems a bit ambiguous. While they did intervene in failing LEAs, they didn't necessarily support them in continuing as they were. In fact, they often took steps to reform or replace them if they weren't improving.\n\nMaybe the question is trying to say that New Labour didn't pursue a policy of simply supporting LEAs that were failing without also imposing reforms or interventions. In that case, perhaps the correct answer is C, because they didn't just support failing LEAs without conditions or changes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another policy that they didn't pursue. Maybe there's something about the internal organization of schools or teacher training that I'm missing.\n\nLet me consider the broader context of New Labour's education reforms. They were big on raising standards, increasing accountability, and introducing more choice in the system. They also emphasized the importance of early years education and increased funding for schools.\n\nBut none of these seem directly related to the options given. Maybe I need to look at it differently.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps \"supporting LEAs that appeared to be failing\" could imply providing additional resources or assistance without necessarily imposing strict conditions or taking over their functions. If that's the case, then maybe New Labour didn't pursue a policy of unconditional support for failing LEAs.\n\nInstead, they opted for interventions and, in some cases, setting up new types of schools like academies that were independent of LEA control. So, in that sense, they were not just supporting LEAs but sometimes bypassing them altogether.\n\nThat makes sense. Therefore, the policy they didn't pursue was supporting LEAs that appeared to be failing, because they preferred to intervene and sometimes replace them with alternative provisions.\n\nI think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
