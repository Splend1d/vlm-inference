                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these procedures an auditor would most likely perform to test the existence assertion of property, plant, and equipment. Existence is all about making sure that the assets that are being reported actually exist. So, the auditor wants to confirm that the company hasn't overstated its property, plant, and equipment by including things that aren't really there.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Obtaining a listing of all current-year additions, vouching significant additions to original invoices, and determining that they have been placed in service.\n\nThis seems like it's more related to verifying that the assets that were added during the year are real and were actually put to use. Vouching to invoices suggests checking for authenticity and that the assets exist. However, this seems more about ensuring completeness and accuracy rather than just existence.\n\nB. Obtaining a detailed fixed-asset register and ensuring items are appropriately capitalized.\n\nThis one is about making sure that the assets are correctly classified as capital expenditures rather than expenses. It's important for ensuring that the assets are properly recorded on the balance sheet, but I'm not sure if this directly tests the existence assertion.\n\nC. Obtaining a listing of current-year additions and verifying that items are recorded in the proper period.\n\nThis seems like it's more about timing\u2014making sure that assets are being recorded in the correct accounting period. It's about cut-off rather than existence per se.\n\nD. Obtaining a detailed fixed-asset register and ensuring depreciation methods are applied consistently.\n\nThis appears to be about the consistency of depreciation policies. While important, this seems more related to the valuation and allocation assertion rather than the existence assertion.\n\nHmm, none of these options seem to directly jump out at me as the perfect test for existence. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nExistence is about confirming that the assets reported actually exist at the balance sheet date. So, the auditor would probably want to perform some sort of physical inspection or observation to see that these assets are indeed present.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Obtaining a listing of all current-year additions, vouching significant additions to original invoices, and determining that they have been placed in service.\n\nVouching to invoices is a way to confirm that the assets were purchased and should exist, and determining that they have been placed in service suggests that they are being used, which implies they exist.\n\nB. Obtaining a detailed fixed-asset register and ensuring items are appropriately capitalized.\n\nThis is more about classification and accounting treatment, not directly about existence.\n\nC. Obtaining a listing of current-year additions and verifying that items are recorded in the proper period.\n\nAgain, more about timing and cut-off.\n\nD. Obtaining a detailed fixed-asset register and ensuring depreciation methods are applied consistently.\n\nThis is about the consistency of accounting policies over time, not about whether the assets exist.\n\nSo, option A seems to be the closest to testing existence because it involves verifying the assets' existence through invoices and confirming they are in use.\n\nWait a minute, but physical inspection might be even better for existence. Does option A include physical inspection? It says \"determining that they have been placed in service,\" which might imply physical inspection, but it's not entirely clear.\n\nMaybe I should consider that vouching to invoices confirms that the purchase occurred, which supports the existence of the asset, assuming that the asset was received and is being used as intended.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, by confirming the purchase via invoices and ensuring the asset is in use, the auditor is gathering evidence that the asset exists.\n\nOption B is about capitalization, which is more related to classification and valuation.\n\nOption C is about timing of recording additions, which is more related to cut-off and completeness.\n\nOption D is about depreciation methods, which is more about valuation and consistency.\n\nTherefore, option A seems to be the most directly related to testing the existence assertion of property, plant, and equipment.\n\nI think the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
