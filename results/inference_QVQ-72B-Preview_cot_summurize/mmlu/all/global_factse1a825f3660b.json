                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the approval of school desegregation at its peak, comparing the South to the rest of the U.S. The options are A. 80%, B. 40%, C. -40%, and D. -80%. Hmm, I need to figure out what this is asking exactly.\n\nFirst off, school desegregation refers to the process of ending segregation in schools, right? Like, making sure that schools aren't separated based on race. This was a big issue in American history, especially in the South. I remember learning about Brown v. Board of Education, which was a Supreme Court case that said separate schools were inherently unequal, but that was back in the 1950s.\n\nSo, this question is asking about the highest point of approval for this idea, and specifically how different that approval was in the South compared to the rest of the country. It's giving me options in percentages, both positive and negative, which suggests that one region might have approved more than the other, and the difference could be expressed as a positive or negative percentage based on which one is higher.\n\nI think I need to look for data on public opinion regarding school desegregation over time, focusing on the South versus the rest of the U.S. Maybe there are surveys or polls that tracked this over the years.\n\nLet me recall if there was a particular time when approval peaked. I know that desegregation was a contentious issue for many years, especially in the South, where resistance was strong. There were things like \"massive resistance\" campaigns and even some schools being closed rather than desegregated.\n\nBut over time, attitudes likely changed, right? Civil rights movements made progress, and perhaps people's views evolved. So, maybe by the late 20th century, approval of desegregation increased.\n\nI should consider when desegregation was at its peak in terms of approval. Maybe it was in the 1960s after the Civil Rights Act was passed, or perhaps later.\n\nWait, the question says \"at its peak,\" which suggests that there was a point in time when approval was highest. I need to find out what that peak was and how much different it was in the South compared to the rest of the country.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is 80%, B is 40%, C is -40%, and D is -80%. These seem like big differences. Is it possible that at the peak of approval, the South was 80% points behind the rest of the country, or maybe ahead?\n\nI need to think about historical contexts. In the 1950s and 1960s, the South was known for stronger resistance to desegregation. So, it's likely that approval was higher in the rest of the country during that time.\n\nBut, over time, attitudes changed. Maybe by the late 1900s or early 2000s, approval in the South caught up or came closer to the rest of the country.\n\nThe question is asking for the difference at the peak of approval. So, I need to find out when approval was highest and then see what the difference was between the South and the rest of the U.S. at that time.\n\nI think I need to look for polls or survey data that show approval rates over time for school desegregation, specifically comparing the South to other regions.\n\nLet me try to recall if there are any famous studies or polls that tracked this specifically.\n\nI remember that the General Social Survey (GSS) has been collecting data on various social attitudes since the 1970s. Maybe they have data on this topic.\n\nAlternatively, Gallup might have historical poll data on desegregation attitudes.\n\nLet me assume that I can find such data and proceed from there.\n\nSuppose I find data from the GSS or Gallup showing approval rates for school desegregation over the years, with breakdowns by region, specifically the South versus other regions.\n\nI would look for the year where approval was highest overall and then see what the approval rates were in the South and the rest of the U.S. that year.\n\nThen, to find the difference, I would subtract the Southern approval rate from the rest-of-the-U.S. approval rate.\n\nIf the rest of the U.S. had higher approval, the difference would be positive. If the South had higher approval, the difference would be negative.\n\nGiven what I know about historical attitudes toward desegregation, it's likely that the rest of the U.S. had higher approval than the South, especially in the early years of desegregation.\n\nBut maybe over time, the South caught up, and the difference narrowed, or perhaps even flipped.\n\nHowever, based on my knowledge, I think it's unlikely that the South had higher approval than the rest of the country at the peak of desegregation approval.\n\nTherefore, the difference would be positive, meaning the rest of the U.S. had higher approval.\n\nSo, between options A and B, A is 80% and B is 40%. Is that the difference?\n\nI need to think about what realistic differences would be.\n\nIf, for example, at the peak, the rest of the U.S. had 90% approval and the South had 10%, that would be an 80% point difference.\n\nBut is that plausible?\n\nWell, in the 1950s and 1960s, Southern resistance was strong, but even then, I doubt that only 10% of Southerners approved of desegregation.\n\nMaybe the difference was smaller, like 40% points.\n\nSuppose the rest of the U.S. had 80% approval and the South had 40%. That would be a 40% point difference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe over time, approval in the South increased to, say, 70%, and the rest of the U.S. was at 90%, which is still a 20% point difference.\n\nBut the options are 80%, 40%, -40%, and -80%, so I need to choose among these.\n\nGiven that, I think the most plausible difference at the peak of approval would be around 40% points, with the rest of the U.S. having higher approval than the South.\n\nTherefore, I would go with option B: 40%.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think about it differently.\n\nMaybe I can look for data on approval rates for school desegregation over time in the South versus other regions.\n\nFrom what I recall, in the 1950s and 1960s, support for desegregation in the South was significantly lower than in other regions.\n\nFor example, a 1954 Gallup poll found that in the South, only about 37% of whites supported the Supreme Court's decision to desegregate schools, whereas in the North, it was around 90%.\n\nSo, at that time, there was a roughly 50% point difference.\n\nBut that was in the 1950s. Over time, attitudes changed.\n\nAccording to some data, by the late 1960s and 1970s, support for desegregation in the South increased, but it was still behind the rest of the country.\n\nFor instance, in the 1970s, a study might show that in the South, around 60% approved of desegregation, while in the rest of the U.S., it was around 80%.\n\nThat would be a 20% point difference, which isn't matching my earlier options.\n\nHmm, maybe my initial thought was off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in more recent years, support in the South has increased further.\n\nLet me see, according to some sources, by the 1990s and 2000s, support for desegregation in the South had risen significantly, but still not matching the levels seen in other regions.\n\nFor example, a 1997 poll might show that in the South, around 70% approved of desegregation, while in the rest of the U.S., it was around 90%.\n\nThat would be a 20% point difference.\n\nStill, that's not matching the options provided, which are 80%, 40%, -40%, and -80%.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the question is referring to a different measure.\n\nPerhaps it's not about current approval rates but about the highest difference ever recorded between the South and the rest of the U.S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the difference in the rate of change over time.\n\nBut the way it's phrased, \"at its peak,\" suggests that it's referring to the maximum difference in approval rates at any point in time.\n\nGiven that, and considering historical data, it's likely that the largest difference was in the earlier years of desegregation, say in the 1950s and 1960s, when resistance in the South was strongest.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, in the 1950s, the difference was around 50% points, with the rest of the U.S. having higher approval.\n\nBy the 1970s and later, the difference narrowed to around 20% points.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then the peak difference would have been around 50% points, which isn't exactly matching the options of 80%, 40%, -40%, or -80%.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that perhaps I'm misremembering the data or that the question is based on different figures.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different aspect of desegregation approval.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nPerhaps the question is referring to the difference in approval rates not at a specific point in time but over a period, like the maximum difference observed.\n\nBut that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's referring to the difference in approval rates between the South and the rest of the U.S. at the national peak of approval.\n\nBut that still doesn't resolve the discrepancy with the options provided.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the question is referring to the difference in approval rates for specific policies related to desegregation, not just general approval.\n\nFor example, approval of busing as a means to achieve desegregation might have had larger regional differences.\n\nBusing was a particularly contentious issue, especially in the South, and there might have been significant differences in approval between regions.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps the difference was larger, possibly approaching 80% points.\n\nHowever, without specific data, it's hard to be certain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different time period or a different measure of desegregation approval.\n\nGiven that, I need to make an educated guess based on what I know.\n\nConsidering that in the 1950s, the difference was around 50% points, and over time it narrowed to around 20% points, the peak difference would have been around 50% points.\n\nBut that's not one of the options, so perhaps the question is referring to a different aspect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the difference was larger in earlier times.\n\nFor example, in the immediate post-Brown v. Board period, resistance in the South was very strong, and approval of desegregation might have been much lower there compared to the rest of the country.\n\nIf, for instance, in the late 1950s, approval in the South was around 20%, and in the rest of the U.S., it was around 80%, that would be a 60% point difference.\n\nStill, that's not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some surveys, the difference was as large as 80% points.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as even in times of strong resistance, there would still be some approval in the South.\n\nTherefore, I think that an 80% point difference is too large.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different measure, like the percentage of schools that were desegregated, rather than public approval.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as the question specifically mentions approval of school desegregation.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options provided, I need to choose between A (80%) and B (40%).\n\nBetween these, I think 40% is a more plausible difference at the peak of approval.\n\nTherefore, my answer is B. 40%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
