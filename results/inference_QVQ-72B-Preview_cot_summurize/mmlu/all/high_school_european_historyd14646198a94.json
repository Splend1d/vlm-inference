In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care.\n\u2014John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, 1559\nWhich of the following beliefs, supported first by Calvin, does this passage seem to best support?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this passage from John Calvin's \"Institutes of the Christian Religion,\" and I need to figure out which belief it best supports, with the options being Salvation, Predestination, Divinity of Jesus, or Simony. I'm not super familiar with all of Calvin's doctrines, but I do know that he was a key figure in the Protestant Reformation and had some pretty influential ideas about predestination.\n\nFirst off, I should probably understand what each of these terms means:\n\nA. Salvation: This generally refers to being saved from sin and its consequences, like going to hell, and being granted eternal life in heaven. It's a central concept in Christianity, but different denominations have different views on how salvation is achieved.\n\nB. Predestination: This is the idea that God has already decided who will be saved and who will not, regardless of their actions or beliefs. It's a doctrine closely associated with Calvinism.\n\nC. Divinity of Jesus: This relates to the belief that Jesus is divine, co-equal with God the Father, and part of the Trinity. It's a fundamental tenet of Christian doctrine.\n\nD. Simony: This is the buying or selling of church offices or roles. It's generally considered corrupt practice and is condemned in most Christian traditions.\n\nJust looking at the options, Simony seems pretty unrelated to the passage, which is about election and grace. So, I can probably eliminate that one right away.\n\nNow, between Salvation, Predestination, and Divinity of Jesus, I need to see which one the passage supports most directly.\n\nLet me read the passage again more carefully.\n\nCalvin is talking about \"election\" and \"the election of grace.\" He mentions that salvation comes from the \"mere goodness of God\" and that it's only through God's choice that people are saved. He also references Paul, saying that the salvation of the remnant of the people is due to the election of grace.\n\nHe goes on to say that those who try to restrict this doctrine are doing harm to both God and man, because this doctrine is meant to humble us and make us realize that our salvation is entirely due to God's mercy, not anything we can claim or deserve.\n\nFurthermore, he mentions that Christ promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care, which seems to reinforce the idea of predestination\u2014that God has chosen specific people to save, and Christ ensures their preservation.\n\nSo, considering this, it seems like the passage is emphasizing that salvation is not based on human merit but on God's sovereign choice, which sounds a lot like the doctrine of predestination.\n\nBut let me think about this more carefully. Is the passage primarily about salvation in general, or is it specifically about predestination?\n\nSalvation is a broad concept that encompasses how people are saved, but predestination is a specific aspect of salvation, focusing on God's foreordained choice of who will be saved.\n\nGiven that the passage repeatedly mentions \"election,\" \"election of grace,\" and God's sovereign choice in salvation, it seems to be zeroing in on the idea of predestination rather than salvation in general.\n\nMoreover, the reference to Paul's teachings on the remnant being saved by election of grace points to the concept of a chosen few, which aligns with predestination.\n\nThe mention of Christ preserving those whom the Father has committed to His care further underscores the idea that salvation is secure for those predestined by God.\n\nSo, between the options, Predestination seems to be the best fit.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if this passage is supporting the Divinity of Jesus.\n\nThe passage does mention Christ and His role in preserving those given to Him by the Father. However, this seems to be more about Christ's role in salvation and less about establishing His divinity.\n\nThe Divinity of Jesus is a foundational Christian belief, but this passage seems to be building on that belief rather than arguing for it.\n\nIt's assuming that Christ is divine and has the authority to preserve those given to Him by the Father, which aligns with His divine nature, but it's not directly arguing for His divinity.\n\nTherefore, while it doesn't contradict the Divinity of Jesus, it's not primarily about establishing that doctrine.\n\nSimilarly, Salvation is a broader concept, and while the passage touches on it, it's more specifically about how salvation is achieved\u2014through God's election and grace, not human merit.\n\nPredestination is a specific aspect of salvation, emphasizing God's sovereign choice in who will be saved.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is B. Predestination.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
