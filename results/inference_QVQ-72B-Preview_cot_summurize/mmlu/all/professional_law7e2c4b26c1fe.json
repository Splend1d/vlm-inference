                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario involving a cross-examination of an expert witness. There's an accounting professor who's testifying as a defense expert in a white-collar crime case. He says that the accounting records clearly show the defendant didn't commit any fraud. Then, during cross-examination, the prosecuting attorney asks him about a particular treatise, and the professor admits he's familiar with it and that it's considered authoritative. The prosecutor wants to read a section from this treatise that basically says it's almost impossible to conclusively determine whether fraud exists in most white-collar crime cases because of the sophistication of the defendants and the range of accounting methods available.\n\nNow, the defendant's lawyer objects to this. The question is, what will the trial judge do? The options are:\n\nA. Overrule the objection and permit the entire treatise to be introduced into evidence.\n\nB. Overrule the objection and permit only the contradictory statements to be read into evidence.\n\nC. Sustain the objection, because the statements in the treatise are hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nD. Sustain the objection, because the professor did not rely on the treatise in making his conclusions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. The professor is an expert witness, and experts can be cross-examined about their opinions and the basis for those opinions. The prosecutor is trying to introduce a treatise to contradict the professor's statement that accounting records conclusively show no fraud. The treatise seems to suggest that it's generally hard to be conclusive about fraud in such cases.\n\nI need to think about the rules of evidence here, particularly regarding the admissibility of treatises and whether they can be used to impeach an expert witness.\n\nI recall that under the rules of evidence, particularly in federal courts, treatises can be used to impeach an expert witness under certain conditions. Specifically, Federal Rule of Evidence 703 allows experts to base their opinions on facts or data that are not admissible in evidence if experts in the field would reasonably rely on such information in forming their opinions. However, if the expert is being cross-examined about such material, it can be introduced to attack or support the expert's credibility.\n\nBut in this case, the prosecutor isn't trying to introduce the treatise to attack the professor's methods or the reliability of his opinion; rather, it seems like the prosecutor is trying to use the treatise to contradict the substance of the professor's conclusion.\n\nWait, the treatise says it's virtually impossible to state conclusively whether fraud exists in most white-collar crime cases. That directly contradicts the professor's statement that the accounting records conclusively show no fraud.\n\nSo, is the prosecutor trying to impeach the professor's conclusion by showing that his statement is at odds with what is considered authoritative in the field?\n\nThat makes sense. If the professor acknowledges that the treatise is authoritative and it contradicts his conclusion, that could undermine his credibility.\n\nBut, is the entire treatise being admitted into evidence, or just the contradictory statements?\n\nOption A says overrule the objection and permit the entire treatise to be introduced into evidence. That seems extreme. Treatises can be lengthy, and introducing the entire thing might be unnecessary and time-consuming. Moreover, only the relevant parts that contradict the professor's testimony should be admissible for impeachment purposes.\n\nOption B says overrule the objection and permit only the contradictory statements to be read into evidence. This seems more reasonable. The court can allow the specific passages that contradict the professor's testimony to be introduced to impeach his credibility.\n\nOption C says sustain the objection because the statements in the treatise are hearsay not within any recognized exception. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the treatise is being used not to prove that it's impossible to detect fraud but to show that the professor's conclusion contradicts what is written in an authoritative source. So, it's being used to impeach the professor's credibility, not to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the treatise. Therefore, hearsay rules shouldn't apply in this context.\n\nOption D says sustain the objection because the professor did not rely on the treatise in making his conclusions. This seems relevant. If the professor didn't consider this treatise when forming his opinion, perhaps his opinion is flawed. However, experts are allowed to base their opinions on their own knowledge and experience, even if they didn't consult a particular treatise. But, if the treatise is considered authoritative, and the professor is familiar with it and acknowledges its authority, then his disregard of it might be relevant to his credibility.\n\nI think the key here is that the treatise is being used to impeach the professor's credibility by showing that his conclusion is at odds with what is considered authoritative in the field. Therefore, the court is likely to allow the contradictory statements to be introduced for that purpose.\n\nSo, the most appropriate action for the trial judge would be to overrule the objection and permit only the contradictory statements to be read into evidence. That would be option B.\n\nWait, but option A suggests introducing the entire treatise. While option B specifies only the contradictory statements. Given that, it's more efficient and relevant to allow only the contradictory parts to be read into evidence.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the treatise is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted but to impeach the witness.\n\nOption D suggests sustaining the objection because the professor didn't rely on the treatise, but I think that even if he didn't rely on it, the fact that an authoritative source contradicts his conclusion is relevant for impeachment purposes.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is option B: overrule the objection and permit only the contradictory statements to be read into evidence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
