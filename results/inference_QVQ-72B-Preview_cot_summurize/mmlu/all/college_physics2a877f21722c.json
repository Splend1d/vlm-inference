                    "text": "So I've got this problem about a photon detector with a quantum efficiency of 0.1. That means that out of every 100 photons that hit the detector, on average, it detects 10 of them. So, if I send 100 photons one after the other, I expect it to detect about 10 of them. That seems straightforward, but there's more to it because there's some randomness involved, right? That's why they're talking about an rms deviation.\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to understand what kind of statistical distribution this detection follows. Since each photon has an independent probability of being detected, this sounds like a Bernoulli trial situation. In Bernoulli trials, if you have n independent trials each with success probability p, the number of successes follows a binomial distribution.\n\nSo, in this case, n is 100 photons, and p is the quantum efficiency, which is 0.1. Therefore, the number of detections, let's call it X, follows a binomial distribution: X ~ Binomial(n=100, p=0.1).\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the average number of detections and the root mean square (rms) deviation, which is essentially the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, the average number of detections. For a binomial distribution, the expected value E(X) is n*p. So, E(X) = 100 * 0.1 = 10. So, on average, the detector will detect 10 photons out of 100.\n\nNext, the rms deviation, which is the standard deviation. For a binomial distribution, the variance Var(X) is n*p*(1-p). So, Var(X) = 100 * 0.1 * (1 - 0.1) = 100 * 0.1 * 0.9 = 9.\n\nTherefore, the standard deviation \u03c3 is the square root of the variance, which is \u221a9 = 3.\n\nSo, the average number of detections is 10, and the rms deviation is about 3.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 4\n\nB. an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3\n\nC. an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 1\n\nD. an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 0.1\n\nBased on my calculations, the correct choice should be B: an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at this. For example, perhaps using the Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution, since n is large and p is small. The Poisson distribution with parameter \u03bb = n*p = 10 would have E(X) = 10 and Var(X) = 10, so \u03c3 = \u221a10 \u2248 3.16, which is roughly 3. So, that aligns with my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different formula for rms deviation that I'm not considering, but I think I'm on the right track.\n\nSo, my final answer is B: an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
