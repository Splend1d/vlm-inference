                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about consolidated financial statements. King, Inc. owns 70% of Simmon Co's outstanding common stock, which means they have a parent-subsidiary relationship. Now, I need to figure out what the total liabilities should be in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nFirst, let's list out what we know:\n\n- King's liabilities: $450,000\n\n- Simmon's liabilities: $200,000\n\n- There's a $100,000 note payable from Simmon to King.\n\nMy understanding is that in consolidated financial statements, we need to combine the financial statements of the parent and its subsidiaries as if they were a single entity. That means we have to add up their assets, liabilities, and other items, but we also have to eliminate any intercompany transactions because those are internal to the consolidated entity.\n\nIn this case, the $100,000 note payable from Simmon to King is an intercompany transaction. This is essentially Simmon owes King $100,000. In consolidation, this would be an elimination entry because it's an internal debt.\n\nSo, to find the total liabilities in the consolidated financial statements, I think I need to add King's liabilities to Simmon's liabilities and then subtract the intercompany note payable.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal liabilities = King's liabilities + Simmon's liabilities - intercompany note payable\n\nTotal liabilities = $450,000 + $200,000 - $100,000\n\nTotal liabilities = $650,000 - $100,000\n\nTotal liabilities = $550,000\n\nWait a minute, that gives me option B. $550,000. But let me double-check if I'm missing something.\n\nI recall that in consolidation, intercompany payables and receivables are eliminated against each other. So, if Simmon owes King $100,000, that would be a receivable for King and a payable for Simmon. In the consolidated statements, this just cancels out.\n\nBut, in the liabilities section, since it's a payable for Simmon, we would subtract that from the total liabilities.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes, intercompany transactions might affect equity or other parts, but in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it. Maybe considering the ownership percentage.\n\nKing owns 70% of Simmon, so in consolidation, we typically consolidate 100% of Simmon's assets and liabilities, and adjust for the non-controlling interest.\n\nBut in this problem, since we're dealing with liabilities, and there's an intercompany payable, I think the straightforward approach is correct.\n\nSo, total liabilities would be $450,000 (King) + $200,000 (Simmon) - $100,000 (intercompany payable) = $550,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. $550,000.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other adjustment needed. For example, does the non-controlling interest affect the total liabilities? Probably not directly, because liabilities are obligations of the entity, regardless of who owns the equity.\n\nSo, I think $550,000 is the correct amount to report in the consolidated financial statements for total liabilities.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ \\$550,000} \\]"
