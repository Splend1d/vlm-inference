                    "text": "So I have this problem here: V and W are 2-dimensional subspaces of R^4, and I need to figure out what the possible dimensions of their intersection V \u2229 W can be. The options are:\n\n(a) 1 only\n\n(b) 2 only\n\n(c) 0 and 1 only\n\n(d) 0, 1, and 2 only\n\nHmm, okay, let's start by understanding what's going on here. V and W are both 2-dimensional subspaces of R^4. So, each of them is a plane in a 4-dimensional space. Now, I need to think about how these two planes can intersect and what dimension their intersection could have.\n\nFirst, I recall that in general, if you have two subspaces U and V of a vector space, the dimension of their intersection can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\dim(U) + \\dim(V) = \\dim(U + V) + \\dim(U \\cap V)\n\\]\n\nThis is called the dimension theorem or the rank-nullity theorem in linear algebra. Maybe I can use this here.\n\nSo, in this case, dim(V) = 2 and dim(W) = 2. Let's denote dim(V \u2229 W) as k. I need to find all possible values of k.\n\nLet\u2019s plug into the formula:\n\n\\[\n2 + 2 = \\dim(V + W) + k\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4 = \\dim(V + W) + k\n\\]\n\nNow, V + W is the subspace spanned by the union of V and W. Since both V and W are subspaces of R^4, the sum V + W can have dimension ranging from 2 up to 4.\n\nWait, why from 2 up to 4? The smallest possible dimension for V + W would be 2, which would happen if V and W are equal or if one is contained in the other. The largest possible dimension is 4, which would happen if V and W together span all of R^4.\n\nSo, dim(V + W) can be 2, 3, or 4.\n\nLet\u2019s consider each case:\n\n1. dim(V + W) = 2:\n\nIn this case, from the equation above:\n\n\\[\n4 = 2 + k \\implies k = 2\n\\]\n\nSo, if V + W has dimension 2, then V \u2229 W has dimension 2.\n\n2. dim(V + W) = 3:\n\n\\[\n4 = 3 + k \\implies k = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, if V + W has dimension 3, then V \u2229 W has dimension 1.\n\n3. dim(V + W) = 4:\n\n\\[\n4 = 4 + k \\implies k = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, if V + W has dimension 4, then V \u2229 W has dimension 0.\n\nTherefore, based on this, k can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nWait a minute, but in the options, there's also 0 and 1 only, and 0, 1, and 2 only. So, according to this, it seems like k can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nBut, is it possible for V \u2229 W to have dimension 0? That would mean that V and W intersect only at the zero vector, which is possible if they are in general position and don't overlap much.\n\nSimilarly, dimension 1 seems possible if they intersect along a line, and dimension 2 if they are equal or one is contained in the other.\n\nSo, based on this, the possible dimensions are 0, 1, and 2.\n\nBut, is it actually possible for V \u2229 W to have dimension 2 when both V and W have dimension 2 in R^4?\n\nWell, if V and W are both 2-dimensional and their intersection is 2-dimensional, that would imply that V and W are equal or one is contained in the other. Since both are 2-dimensional subspaces of R^4, it's possible for them to be equal.\n\nSo, all three dimensions (0, 1, and 2) are possible.\n\nBut, just to make sure, maybe I should try to think of specific examples.\n\nLet\u2019s consider R^4 with standard basis vectors e1, e2, e3, e4.\n\nLet\u2019s define V as the subspace spanned by e1 and e2:\n\n\\[\nV = \\text{span}\\{e1, e2\\}\n\\]\n\nAnd W as the subspace spanned by e1 and e3:\n\n\\[\nW = \\text{span}\\{e1, e3\\}\n\\]\n\nThen, their intersection V \u2229 W is spanned by e1, which is a 1-dimensional subspace.\n\nSo, this is an example where dim(V \u2229 W) = 1.\n\nNow, for dim(V \u2229 W) = 0, let\u2019s try to find V and W such that their intersection is only the zero vector.\n\nLet\u2019s define V as before, spanned by e1 and e2, and W spanned by e3 and e4:\n\n\\[\nW = \\text{span}\\{e3, e4\\}\n\\]\n\nThen, V and W intersect only at the zero vector, so dim(V \u2229 W) = 0.\n\nFinally, for dim(V \u2229 W) = 2, let\u2019s set V and W to be the same subspace.\n\nFor example:\n\n\\[\nV = W = \\text{span}\\{e1, e2\\}\n\\]\n\nThen, V \u2229 W = V = W, which is 2-dimensional.\n\nAlternatively, let\u2019s see if there are different V and W where their intersection is 2-dimensional.\n\nWait, if V and W are both 2-dimensional and their sum spans R^4, then their intersection would have dimension 0, as per the formula earlier.\n\nBut if their sum is a 3-dimensional subspace, then their intersection would have dimension 1.\n\nAnd if their sum is a 2-dimensional subspace, then their intersection would have dimension 2.\n\nSo, in the case where V and W are equal or one is contained in the other, their intersection is 2-dimensional.\n\nIn the case where their sum is 3-dimensional, intersection is 1-dimensional.\n\nAnd when their sum is 4-dimensional, intersection is 0-dimensional.\n\nSo, all three possibilities can occur.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be (d) 0, 1, and 2 only.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options:\n\n(a) 1 only\n\n(b) 2 only\n\n(c) 0 and 1 only\n\n(d) 0, 1, and 2 only\n\nBased on my reasoning, (d) seems correct.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any restriction that might prevent certain dimensions from being possible.\n\nFor example, is it possible that in R^4, two 2-dimensional subspaces cannot intersect trivially, i.e., only at the zero vector?\n\nOr can they intersect in a 1-dimensional subspace?\n\nFrom my examples above, it seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a theorem that specifies the possible intersection dimensions.\n\nI recall that in general, for two subspaces U and V of a vector space, the dimension of their intersection can range from max(0, dim(U) + dim(V) - dim(V)) to min(dim(U), dim(V)).\n\nIn this case, dim(U) = dim(V) = 2, and dim(V) = 4.\n\nSo, min(2, 2) = 2, and max(0, 2 + 2 - 4) = max(0, 0) = 0.\n\nWait, that would suggest that k can be between 0 and 2, inclusive.\n\nWhich again suggests that k can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be (d) 0, 1, and 2 only.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider the geometric interpretation.\n\nIn 4-dimensional space, two 2-dimensional subspaces can intersect in various ways.\n\n- They can intersect in a 2-dimensional subspace, meaning one is contained in the other.\n\n- They can intersect in a 1-dimensional subspace, which is a line.\n\n- Or they can intersect only at the origin, which is a 0-dimensional subspace.\n\nSo, all three cases are possible.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (d) 0, 1, and 2 only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
