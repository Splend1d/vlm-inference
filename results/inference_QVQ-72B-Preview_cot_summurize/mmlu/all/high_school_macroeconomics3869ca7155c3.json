                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about banking and money creation. It says that the reserve ratio is 10 percent, and a new customer deposits $500. The question is, what's the maximum amount of money that can be created from this deposit? The options are $500, $4,500, $5,000, and $50.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what the reserve ratio is and how it affects money creation in a bank. The reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that a bank has to keep as reserves and can't lend out. So, if the reserve ratio is 10 percent, that means for every dollar deposited, the bank has to keep 10 cents and can lend out the remaining 90 cents.\n\nNow, when a new customer deposits $500, the bank keeps 10 percent of that as reserve, which is $50, and can lend out the remaining $450. But here's where it gets interesting because that $450 that's lent out can then be redeposited into another bank (or even the same bank), and the process repeats, creating more money in the economy.\n\nSo, this is the money multiplier effect. The money multiplier is essentially 1 divided by the reserve ratio. Since the reserve ratio is 10 percent, or 0.10, the money multiplier should be 1 / 0.10 = 10. Therefore, the total money created from the initial deposit of $500 should be $500 multiplied by 10, which is $5,000.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check this because I want to make sure I'm not missing anything. The formula for the money multiplier is indeed 1 / r, where r is the reserve ratio. And in this case, r is 0.10, so the multiplier should be 10. Applying this multiplier to the initial deposit of $500, we get $5,000, which seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about the process step by step. When the initial deposit of $500 is made, the bank keeps 10 percent as reserve ($50) and lends out the remaining $450. This $450 is then deposited into another bank, which keeps 10 percent as reserve ($45) and lends out $405. This continues, with each subsequent deposit being 90 percent of the previous one.\n\nSo, the total money created would be the sum of a geometric series: $500 + $450 + $405 + $364.50 + ... and so on, approaching infinity in theory, but in reality, it's limited by the money multiplier.\n\nCalculating the sum of this infinite geometric series, where the first term is $500 and the common ratio is 0.90 (since each step is 90 percent of the previous one), the total money created would be $500 / (1 - 0.90) = $500 / 0.10 = $5,000.\n\nThis matches the result I got earlier using the money multiplier formula. So, it seems that the correct answer is $5,000.\n\nLet me just quickly consider if there's any other factor that could affect this. For example, if there were any leakages or if the reserve ratio changes, but the problem states that the reserve ratio is 10 percent, and there's no mention of any other factors like cash withdrawals or changes in policy.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the initial deposit is indeed $500 and that there are no other deposits or withdrawals that would affect the total money supply.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the maximum amount of money that can be created from the initial deposit of $500 with a reserve ratio of 10 percent is $5,000.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $500\n\nB. $4,500\n\nC. $5,000\n\nD. $50\n\nIt seems that option C, $5,000, is the correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the money multiplier again. If the reserve ratio is 10 percent, then the money multiplier is 10. Multiplying the initial deposit of $500 by 10 gives $5,000. Alternatively, using the formula for the money multiplier, which is 1 / r, where r is the reserve ratio, again gives 1 / 0.10 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the total money created is $500 * 10 = $5,000.\n\nI think that's solid. So, my final answer is C. $5,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
