                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Who was the first First Lady to run for political office?\" And the options are A. Hillary Clinton, B. Rosalynn Carter, C. Bess Truman, and D. Eleanor Roosevelt. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these First Ladies was the first to run for political office.\n\nFirst off, I know that First Ladies are typically not elected positions; they're more like unofficial roles based on their marriage to the president. So, running for political office would mean, like, trying to get elected to a specific position, right? Maybe Congress or something.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Hillary Clinton. I know she was the First Lady when Bill Clinton was president. After his presidency, she ran for the Senate from New York and won, I think. So, did she run for political office after being First Lady? Yeah, that seems to be the case. But is she the first one to do so?\n\nNext, Rosalynn Carter. She was the First Lady during Jimmy Carter's presidency. After he left office, did she run for anything? I don't recall. Maybe she didn't run for political office herself. So, probably not the first one.\n\nThen there's Bess Truman. She was the First Lady when Harry Truman was president. I don't remember her running for political office. She seems to have stayed out of politics, at least in terms of running for office herself.\n\nLastly, Eleanor Roosevelt. She was the First Lady during Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency, which was a long time ago. I know she was very involved in politics and even after FDR passed away, she continued to be active in public service. Did she ever run for political office?\n\nHmm, I think she was appointed to positions but didn't run for elected office. Or did she? I might be mistaken.\n\nLet me see if I can recall any specific instances. I know that Eleanor Roosevelt was appointed as a delegate to the United Nations and was involved in writing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But was she ever a candidate for elected office?\n\nI think she was once considered for vice president or something, but I don't think she actually ran. Maybe I need to double-check that.\n\nAlright, so among these options, Hillary Clinton seems to be the one who ran for political office after being First Lady. But was she the first one to do so?\n\nI think that's the case. Before her, I don't recall any First Ladies running for elected office. Rosalynn Carter didn't, Bess Truman didn't, and Eleanor Roosevelt didn't, as far as I know.\n\nWait a minute, what about Jacqueline Kennedy? She was First Lady during John F. Kennedy's presidency. Did she ever run for office? No, I don't think so. She remained private after his presidency.\n\nWhat about Lady Bird Johnson? She was First Lady during Lyndon B. Johnson's presidency. Did she run for office? I don't think so. She focused on environmental causes and education.\n\nSo, going back to the options given, it seems that Hillary Clinton was indeed the first First Lady to run for political office. She ran for the Senate and won, and later she also ran for president, but again, that's after being First Lady.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer should be A. Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think if there's any possibility that one of the others did run for office and I'm just forgetting it.\n\nFor example, Rosalynn Carter\u2014did she ever run for office? I don't think so. She was involved in her husband's campaigns but didn't run herself.\n\nBess Truman\u2014no, I don't recall her running for office. She was more behind the scenes, supporting her husband.\n\nEleanor Roosevelt\u2014while she was very active in politics and had a huge impact, I don't think she ever ran for elected office herself. She held appointed positions but wasn't a candidate in an election.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Hillary Clinton.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Hillary Clinton}} \\]"
