                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: x and y are positive integers, and 3x + 7y is divisible by 11. I need to find which of the given expressions is also necessarily divisible by 11.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for 3x + 7y to be divisible by 11. That means that when you divide 3x + 7y by 11, there's no remainder. So, 3x + 7y is a multiple of 11.\n\nI need to see which of the options A, B, C, or D must also be divisible by 11, given this condition.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\n**Option A: 4x + 6y**\n\nI need to check if 4x + 6y must be divisible by 11 whenever 3x + 7y is divisible by 11.\n\nMaybe I can manipulate the equation 3x + 7y \u2261 0 mod 11 to see if it implies that 4x + 6y \u2261 0 mod 11.\n\nFirst, let's solve for x in terms of y from the first equation.\n\n3x + 7y \u2261 0 mod 11\n\nSo, 3x \u2261 -7y mod 11\n\nTo solve for x, I can multiply both sides by the inverse of 3 mod 11. The inverse of 3 mod 11 is 4, because 3*4 = 12 \u2261 1 mod 11.\n\nSo, x \u2261 -7 * 4 mod 11\n\nCalculate -7 * 4: -28 mod 11\n\n-28 mod 11 is the same as (-28 + 3*11) mod 11 = (-28 + 33) mod 11 = 5 mod 11\n\nSo, x \u2261 5y mod 11\n\nNow, plug this into 4x + 6y and see if it's divisible by 11.\n\n4x + 6y \u2261 4*(5y) + 6y mod 11 \u2261 20y + 6y mod 11 \u2261 26y mod 11 \u2261 26 \u2261 4 mod 11 (since 26 - 2*11 = 4)\n\nSo, 4x + 6y \u2261 4 mod 11, which is not necessarily 0. So, this doesn't have to be divisible by 11.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can pick specific x and y that satisfy 3x + 7y \u2261 0 mod 11 and see if 4x + 6y is divisible by 11.\n\nLet's try y = 1:\n\nFrom x \u2261 5y mod 11, x \u2261 5 mod 11. So, x could be 5.\n\nCheck: 3*5 + 7*1 = 15 + 7 = 22, which is divisible by 11 (22/11=2).\n\nNow, 4x + 6y = 4*5 + 6*1 = 20 + 6 = 26, which is not divisible by 11.\n\nSo, in this case, 4x + 6y is not divisible by 11, even though 3x + 7y is. Therefore, option A is not necessarily true.\n\n**Option B: x + y + 5**\n\nNext, I need to see if x + y + 5 must be divisible by 11 whenever 3x + 7y is divisible by 11.\n\nAgain, using x \u2261 5y mod 11 from earlier.\n\nSo, x + y + 5 \u2261 5y + y + 5 mod 11 \u2261 6y + 5 mod 11\n\nThis doesn't necessarily equal 0 mod 11. For example, if y=1, x=5, then x + y + 5 = 5 + 1 + 5 = 11, which is divisible by 11.\n\nBut let's try y=2: x \u2261 5*2 mod 11 \u2261 10 mod 11, so x=10.\n\nThen, x + y + 5 = 10 + 2 + 5 = 17, which is not divisible by 11.\n\nSo, in this case, x + y + 5 is not divisible by 11, even though 3x + 7y is.\n\nTherefore, option B is not necessarily true.\n\n**Option C: 9x + 4y**\n\nNow, check if 9x + 4y must be divisible by 11 whenever 3x + 7y is.\n\nAgain, using x \u2261 5y mod 11.\n\nSo, 9x + 4y \u2261 9*(5y) + 4y mod 11 \u2261 45y + 4y mod 11 \u2261 49y mod 11\n\n49 mod 11 is 49 - 4*11 = 49 - 44 = 5, so 49y \u2261 5y mod 11.\n\nSo, 9x + 4y \u2261 5y mod 11\n\nThis doesn't necessarily equal 0 mod 11.\n\nFor example, if y=1, then 5*1 = 5 \u2261 5 mod 11, not 0.\n\nAlternatively, if y=0, but y is a positive integer, so y\u22651.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find x and y such that both conditions are met.\n\nLet's try y=1, x=5: 9*5 + 4*1 = 45 + 4 = 49, which is 49/11 = 4.4545..., not an integer multiple.\n\nWait, but 49 divided by 11 is 4 with a remainder of 5, since 4*11=44 and 49-44=5.\n\nSo, 49 is not divisible by 11.\n\nAnother example: y=2, x=10: 9*10 + 4*2 = 90 + 8 = 98.\n\n98 divided by 11 is 8*11=88, remainder 10.\n\nStill not divisible by 11.\n\nSo, option C is not necessarily true.\n\n**Option D: 4x - 9y**\n\nFinally, check if 4x - 9y must be divisible by 11 whenever 3x + 7y is.\n\nAgain, using x \u2261 5y mod 11.\n\nSo, 4x - 9y \u2261 4*(5y) - 9y mod 11 \u2261 20y - 9y mod 11 \u2261 11y mod 11 \u2261 0 mod 11\n\nBecause 11y is clearly divisible by 11 for any integer y.\n\nWait, but y is a positive integer, so 11y is always divisible by 11.\n\nSo, in this case, 4x - 9y must be divisible by 11 whenever 3x + 7y is divisible by 11.\n\nLet me verify this with some specific values.\n\nEarlier, I had y=1, x=5: 4*5 - 9*1 = 20 - 9 = 11, which is divisible by 11.\n\nAnother example: y=2, x=10: 4*10 - 9*2 = 40 - 18 = 22, which is divisible by 11.\n\nAnother example: y=3, x=15: 4*15 - 9*3 = 60 - 27 = 33, which is divisible by 11.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if there's any case where this might not hold.\n\nSuppose y=4, x=20: 4*20 - 9*4 = 80 - 36 = 44, which is divisible by 11.\n\nAnother one: y=5, x=25: 4*25 - 9*5 = 100 - 45 = 55, which is divisible by 11.\n\nIt seems consistent across these examples.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 4x - 9y.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
