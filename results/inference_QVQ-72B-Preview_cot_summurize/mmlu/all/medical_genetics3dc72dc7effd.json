                    "text": "So I have this question about DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome, and it's asking what chromosome deletion causes it. The options are chromosome 4, 7, 15, or 22. Hmm, I need to recall what I know about this condition.\n\nFirst off, I remember that DiGeorge syndrome and Shprintzen syndrome are often used interchangeably now, and they're both related to a specific genetic deletion. I think the official name is velocardiofacial syndrome, but I might be mixing that up with something else. Anyway, I know it's a congenital disorder that can affect multiple systems in the body, including the heart, immune system, and facial features.\n\nNow, about the chromosome involved. I think it's chromosome 22. Let me see if that's correct. I recall that there's a microdeletion on chromosome 22 that's associated with this syndrome. I think it's specifically a deletion on the long arm of chromosome 22, maybe 22q11.2 or something like that. Yeah, that sounds familiar.\n\nLet me consider the other options to make sure. Chromosome 4 is involved in some other syndromes, like Williams syndrome, I think, but not DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome. Chromosome 7 is involved in conditions like Williams syndrome or maybe some types of leukemia, but again, not this one. Chromosome 15 is associated with Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome, which are due to deletions or abnormalities in that chromosome, but again, not DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome.\n\nSo, based on what I know, the correct answer should be chromosome 22. But just to be thorough, I'll double-check my memory.\n\nI remember that the deletion on chromosome 22q11.2 is the most common chromosomal abnormality associated with DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome. It's estimated that about 90% of patients with this syndrome have this specific deletion. So, that seems pretty conclusive.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll think about the key features of DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome. It's characterized by defects in the development of the thymus and parathyroid glands, which can lead to immunodeficiencies and low calcium levels, respectively. There are also cardiac defects, particularly involving the outflow tracts of the heart, and distinct facial features. All of these features are consistent with a disruption in the development of the pharyngeal arches during embryogenesis, which is thought to be due to the chromosome 22 deletion.\n\nI don't think any of these features are typically associated with deletions in chromosomes 4, 7, or 15. So, I'm fairly confident that chromosome 22 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I'll consider if there's any possibility that another chromosome could be involved. For example, some syndromes can have similar features but be caused by different genetic mutations. However, in the case of DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome, the vast majority of cases are due to the 22q11.2 deletion. There are rare cases where other genetic mutations might cause similar phenotypes, but the primary and most common cause is indeed the chromosome 22 deletion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question \"The DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome is caused by a deletion in which chromosome?\" is D. 22.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
