                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"For which of the following rings is it possible for the product of two nonzero elements to be zero?\" And the options are:\n\nA. The ring of complex numbers\n\nB. The ring of integers modulo 11\n\nC. The ring of continuous real-valued functions on [0, 1]\n\nD. The ring {a + b * sqrt(2) : a and b are rational numbers}\n\nAlright, so the question is essentially asking which of these rings have zero divisors. Because if two nonzero elements can multiply to give zero, that means there are zero divisors in the ring.\n\nFirst up, option A: the ring of complex numbers. Okay, so complex numbers are like a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit. This ring is an integral domain, right? I remember that integral domains are commutative rings with no zero divisors. And the complex numbers are definitely an integral domain because multiplication is commutative, and there are no zero divisors. So, in this ring, if ab = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0. Therefore, it's not possible for two nonzero complex numbers to multiply to give zero. So, option A is a no.\n\nNext, option B: the ring of integers modulo 11. Alright, so this is Z_11, which is the set of equivalence classes of integers modulo 11. It's a finite field, right? Wait, is Z_11 a field? Let me think. 11 is a prime number, and I recall that Z_p is a field when p is prime. Yeah, that's right. So Z_11 is a field, and fields have no zero divisors. So, in Z_11, if you have two nonzero elements and multiply them, you can't get zero. Because fields are integral domains. So, option B is also a no.\n\nOption C: the ring of continuous real-valued functions on [0, 1]. Hmm, this is interesting. So, this ring consists of all continuous functions from the interval [0, 1] to the real numbers, with pointwise addition and multiplication. Now, can two nonzero functions multiply to give the zero function? Let's see. Suppose I have two functions f and g, both nonzero, but their product f*g is zero. That would mean that for every x in [0, 1], f(x)*g(x) = 0. But since f and g are both nonzero, there must be some x where f(x) \u2260 0 and g(x) \u2260 0, but their product is zero. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If f(x) and g(x) are both nonzero, their product shouldn't be zero. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nActually, perhaps I can find two functions where each is zero wherever the other is nonzero. Like, f is zero where g is nonzero, and vice versa. That way, their product is always zero. But both functions are nonzero functions because they are nonzero somewhere. Let's try to construct such functions.\n\nLet's define f(x) = x - 1/2, and g(x) = 1 - x. Wait, no, that might not work. Let me think again. If I take f(x) to be zero on [0, 1/2) and nonzero on [1/2, 1], and g(x) to be zero on [1/2, 1] and nonzero on [0, 1/2), then their product would be zero everywhere. For example, f(x) could be defined piecewise: f(x) = 0 for x in [0, 1/2), and f(x) = x - 1/2 for x in [1/2, 1]. Similarly, g(x) = 0 for x in [1/2, 1], and g(x) = 1 - x for x in [0, 1/2). Both f and g are continuous, and their product is zero everywhere. So, in this ring, it is possible to have two nonzero elements whose product is zero. Therefore, option C is a yes.\n\nLastly, option D: the ring {a + b * sqrt(2) : a and b are rational numbers}. Okay, so this is the ring of numbers of the form a + b\u221a2, where a and b are rational numbers. This is essentially the ring Q[\u221a2], which is the set of all polynomials in \u221a2 with rational coefficients, but since \u221a2 has degree 2 over Q, it's isomorphic to Q[x]/(x^2 - 2), which is a domain. Wait, is Q[\u221a2] an integral domain? I think so, because Q is a field, and \u221a2 is algebraic over Q with minimal polynomial x^2 - 2, which is irreducible over Q. Therefore, Q[\u221a2] should be an integral domain, meaning it has no zero divisors. So, in this ring, if (a + b\u221a2)(c + d\u221a2) = 0, then either a + b\u221a2 = 0 or c + d\u221a2 = 0, assuming a, b, c, d are rational and not all zero. Therefore, option D is a no.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nA. Complex numbers: no zero divisors\n\nB. Integers modulo 11: no zero divisors (since 11 is prime)\n\nC. Continuous real-valued functions on [0,1]: yes, zero divisors exist\n\nD. Rational numbers extended by \u221a2: no zero divisors\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
