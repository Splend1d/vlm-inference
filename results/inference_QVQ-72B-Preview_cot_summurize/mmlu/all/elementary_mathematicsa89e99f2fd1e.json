                    "text": "So I have this problem here. Ms. Carter has 30 students in her classroom, and she arranges them into 5 equal groups. The question is asking which expression represents how to find the number of students in each group. The options are:\n\nA. 30 + 5\n\nB. 30 / 5\n\nC. 30 - 5\n\nD. 30 x 5\n\nAlright, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have 30 students divided into 5 equal groups, and we need to find out how many students are in each group. So, basically, we need to split 30 into 5 equal parts.\n\nLet me recall some basic arithmetic operations and what they represent.\n\nAddition (+): This is used to combine two numbers. So, 30 + 5 would mean adding 5 more students to the existing 30, which would make 35. But that doesn't help us divide the students into groups.\n\nSubtraction (-): This is used to find the difference between two numbers. So, 30 - 5 would mean removing 5 students from 30, which would leave 25. Again, not helpful for dividing into groups.\n\nMultiplication (x): This is used to scale or repeat addition. So, 30 x 5 would mean taking 30 five times, which is 150. That seems too many students, and it doesn't give me the number per group.\n\nDivision (/): This is used to split a number into equal parts. So, 30 / 5 would mean dividing 30 into 5 equal parts. Each part would be 6 students.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check.\n\nIf I have 30 students and I divide them into 5 groups, each group should have 30 \u00f7 5 = 6 students. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I can think of it another way. Maybe I can consider the total number of students and see how they are distributed among the groups.\n\nSo, if there are 5 groups and each group has the same number of students, then yes, division is the operation that fits here.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Is there a possibility that another operation could also represent the number of students per group?\n\nFor example, could subtraction somehow represent grouping? Well, subtraction is more about taking away, not about grouping equally. So, no, I don't think so.\n\nWhat about addition? Adding 5 to 30 would just increase the total number of students, not group them.\n\nMultiplication seems like it would make the groups larger or something, but not in the context of dividing the existing 30 students into 5 groups.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems pretty clear that division is the correct operation to use here.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's think about the units. The total number of students is 30, and the number of groups is 5. To find the number of students per group, we're essentially finding how many students per group, so it's 30 students divided by 5 groups, which gives 6 students per group.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nI think I might be overthinking this. The question is pretty straightforward: divide the total number of students by the number of groups to find the number of students per group.\n\nSo, the expression should be 30 / 5.\n\nWait, but let's see if there's any trick here. Maybe the question is trying to test understanding of division in the context of grouping.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's testing the concept of division as repeated subtraction. For example, if you subtract 6 from 30 five times, you get zero, which confirms that each group has 6 students.\n\nBut in terms of selecting the expression, 30 / 5 is the direct way to represent this.\n\nAnother way to look at it is using fractions. The number of students per group is 30 divided by 5, which is the same as 30/5, which equals 6.\n\nSo, again, that points to option B.\n\nIs there any other perspective I should consider? Perhaps checking if the groups are indeed equal.\n\nFor example, if I divide 30 by 5 and get 6, I can multiply back to check: 5 times 6 is 30. Yes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if I try to use another operation, say addition, to see if it makes sense, like adding up 6 five times, which is 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 30, which again confirms that 6 is the correct number per group.\n\nBut in terms of the expression to find the number of students per group, division is the primary operation that fits here.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and it's clear that 30 / 5 is the correct expression to find the number of students in each group.\n\nSo, the answer should be option B. 30 / 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 30/5} \\]"
