                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this economics problem about hiring the least-cost combination of labor and capital. There are four options, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the principle of least-cost combination in production. Basically, a firm wants to produce a certain level of output at the lowest possible cost by choosing the optimal mix of inputs, in this case, labor and capital.\n\nI remember that in production theory, the optimal input combination is determined by comparing the marginal products of inputs relative to their prices.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- MPL: Marginal product of labor\n\n- MPK: Marginal product of capital\n\n- PL: Price of labor\n\n- PK: Price of capital\n\nThe firm aims to maximize output for a given cost, or minimize cost for a given output level.\n\nThe condition for minimizing cost is that the marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS) between labor and capital should be equal to the ratio of their prices.\n\nMRTS = MPL / MPK\n\nAnd we set MRTS = PL / PK\n\nSo, MPL / MPK = PL / PK\n\nRearranging, MPL / PL = MPK / PK\n\nWait, that looks familiar. Option C says:\n\nFind the combination of labor and capital where the marginal product of labor divided by the price of labor is equal to the marginal product of capital divided by the price of capital.\n\nThat seems to match what I just derived. So, option C says:\n\nFind the combination of labor and capital where the marginal product of labor divided by the price of labor is equal to the marginal product of capital divided by the price of capital.\n\nYes, that's consistent with the condition for least-cost combination.\n\nLet me check the other options to make sure they are incorrect.\n\nOption A says:\n\nFind the combination of labor and capital where the marginal product of labor is equal to the marginal product of capital.\n\nSo, MPL = MPK\n\nThis doesn't take into account the prices of labor and capital. But in the condition I derived earlier, we have MPL / MPK = PL / PK, which only equals 1 if PL = PK, which isn't generally the case. So, this can't be right because it ignores the cost of inputs.\n\nOption B says:\n\nFind the combination of labor and capital where the ratio of the marginal product of labor to the marginal product of capital is equal to one.\n\nSo, MPL / MPK = 1\n\nAgain, this is similar to option A. It sets MPL equal to MPK, which, as before, doesn't consider the prices of inputs. This is also incorrect for the same reason as option A.\n\nOption D says:\n\nFind the combination of labor and capital where the price of labor is equal to the price of capital.\n\nSo, PL = PK\n\nThis is just comparing the prices of inputs without relating to their marginal products. This doesn't ensure efficient use of inputs. A firm could minimize costs by using more of the cheaper input, but only if it also considers the productivity of that input.\n\nWait, actually, if PL = PK, then the firm might choose to use more of the cheaper input if it has a higher marginal product per dollar, but this option only looks at the prices being equal, not relating to marginal products.\n\nMoreover, in the condition for cost minimization, MPL / PL = MPK / PK, it's possible for PL \u2260 PK, as long as the ratios are equal.\n\nTherefore, option D is also incorrect.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, option C seems to be the correct one.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the economic logic behind option C.\n\nIf MPL / PL = MPK / PK, it means that the firm is getting the same marginal product per dollar spent on each input. This ensures that the firm is not wasting resources by using more of one input relative to the other.\n\nIn other words, if MPL / PL > MPK / PK, it means that the firm can reduce costs by using more labor (since it's giving more output per dollar spent compared to capital), and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, the equality ensures that the firm is using the optimal mix of inputs for cost minimization.\n\nSo, yes, option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
