                    "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many push-ups Michelle did in January. The problem says there are 31 days in January, and she did 45 push-ups each day. So, to find the total number of push-ups, I should multiply the number of days by the number of push-ups per day. That makes sense.\n\nSo, the expression is 31 times 45. Hmm, I need to calculate that. Let me see, I can do this step by step to make sure I don't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I'll write down 31 and multiply it by 45. I remember that when multiplying larger numbers, it's helpful to break it down into smaller parts. Maybe I can multiply 31 by 50 and then subtract something, but that might not be the easiest way.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the standard multiplication algorithm that I learned in school. Let's try that.\n\nSo, writing 31 and multiplying it by 45:\n\n```\n\n    31\n\n  \u00d7 45\n\n  -----\n\n```\n\nFirst, I'll multiply 31 by 5, which is 155. Then, I'll multiply 31 by 40, which is 1,240. Now, I need to add those two results together: 155 plus 1,240.\n\nLet me add 155 and 1,240. 155 plus 1,200 is 1,355, and then adding the remaining 40 would bring it to 1,395.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check that addition. 155 plus 1,200 is indeed 1,355, and then adding 40 would make it 1,395. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can check by doing the full multiplication step by step.\n\nMultiplying 31 by 5:\n\n31 \u00d7 5 = 155\n\nWriting that down, I'll put the 55 and carry the 1.\n\nThen, multiplying 31 by 4, but remember, it's actually 31 \u00d7 40, because the 4 is in the tens place.\n\nSo, 31 \u00d7 40 is 1,240.\n\nNow, adding the two results: 155 plus 1,240.\n\nAgain, that comes to 1,395.\n\nAlright, that seems consistent.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to verify this, maybe using a different method.\n\nI could use the distributive property of multiplication over addition. So, 31 \u00d7 45 is the same as 31 \u00d7 (40 + 5), which is 31 \u00d7 40 plus 31 \u00d7 5, which is what I did before: 1,240 plus 155, totaling 1,395.\n\nOr, I could try to switch the order: 45 \u00d7 31.\n\nFirst, 45 \u00d7 30 is 1,350, and 45 \u00d7 1 is 45. Adding those together: 1,350 plus 45 is 1,395.\n\nAgain, I get the same answer, 1,395.\n\nI think that's solid. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nThe problem says \"31 days in January, 45 push-ups each day.\" So, it's straightforward multiplication. No need to worry about any other operations like addition or subtraction here.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 125 push-ups\n\nB. 279 push-ups\n\nC. 1,395 push-ups\n\nD. 1,406 push-ups\n\nClearly, 1,395 is one of the options, which matches my calculation.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can use a calculator to confirm.\n\nCalculating 31 times 45:\n\n31 \u00d7 45 = 1,395\n\nYes, that's what the calculator says too.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1395} \\]"
