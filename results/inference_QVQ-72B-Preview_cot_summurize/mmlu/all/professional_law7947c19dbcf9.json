                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out what the trial judge should do regarding an objection during a cross-examination. Let me try to understand the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a pedestrian who was injured by a defendant on a motorcycle. The pedestrian is suing the defendant for injuries to her leg. Now, during the trial, the pedestrian's physician is being cross-examined by the defendant's attorney. The attorney asks the doctor whether the pedestrian told him that her leg, which she claims was injured in this incident, had actually been permanently stiff due to a previous field hockey injury from high school.\n\nSo, the pedestrian's attorney objects to this question. I need to determine whether the trial judge should sustain the objection or overrule it, and based on which legal principle.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Sustain the objection, as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nB. Sustain the objection, as violative of the physician-patient privilege.\n\nC. Overrule the objection, as a statement made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment.\n\nD. Overrule the objection, as a statement against interest.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, is this question seeking hearsay? Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the attorney is asking the doctor about what the pedestrian told him regarding her leg's condition from a previous injury. So, the pedestrian's statement to the doctor about her leg being permanently stiff from a high school injury is hearsay because it's being offered to prove that her leg was indeed stiff before this incident.\n\nNow, is there any exception to the hearsay rule that applies here?\n\nOption C mentions that it's a statement made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment. I recall that statements made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment are exempt from the hearsay rule under the rules of evidence. This is because doctors need accurate information from patients to provide proper care, and patients generally have no reason to lie to their doctors about their medical history.\n\nSo, if the pedestrian made this statement to the doctor for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment, it should be admissible under this exception.\n\nBut wait, in this scenario, the pedestrian is suing for injuries she claims were caused by the defendant's motorcycle. The defendant's attorney is trying to show that the leg was already injured from a previous incident, thereby reducing the defendant's liability for the current injuries.\n\nSo, the pedestrian's statement to the doctor about her leg being stiff from a previous injury would be relevant to determining the extent of the current injuries and whether they were pre-existing.\n\nBut is this statement admissible under the hearsay exception for statements made for diagnosis or treatment?\n\nI think so. The pedestrian was likely providing her medical history to the doctor to help diagnose and treat her current condition after the accident. Therefore, her statement about the previous injury and stiffness would be relevant for that purpose.\n\nOption D mentions a statement against interest. A statement against interest is when someone makes a statement that goes against their own best interests. In this case, the pedestrian's statement about her leg being stiff from a previous injury could potentially reduce the compensation she might receive if it's proven that the leg was already injured before the accident. So, in a way, it's against her interest to admit that her leg was already stiff from a previous injury.\n\nHowever, for a statement against interest to be admissible, the declarant must be unavailable to testify, and the statement must be against the declarant's penal, civil, or financial interest at the time it was made.\n\nIn this scenario, the pedestrian is presumably available to testify, so the statement against interest exception may not apply.\n\nTherefore, option D is probably not the right choice.\n\nNow, option B suggests sustaining the objection due to physician-patient privilege. Physician-patient privilege generally protects communications between a patient and their doctor from being disclosed without the patient's consent.\n\nHowever, in litigation, especially in personal injury cases, when a plaintiff puts their physical or mental condition at issue by filing a lawsuit, they may waive the physician-patient privilege regarding those conditions.\n\nIn this case, the pedestrian is suing for leg injuries allegedly caused by the defendant's motorcycle. Therefore, her leg condition is at issue, and she may have waived the privilege regarding that condition.\n\nBut, even if there is a waiver, the doctor can still testify about what the patient told him regarding her leg's condition, provided that the statements are relevant and admissible under the rules of evidence.\n\nGiven that, I don't think the physician-patient privilege would be a valid reason to sustain the objection in this context.\n\nOption A suggests sustaining the objection because it's hearsay not within any recognized exception. But as I thought earlier, the statement seems to fall under the exception for statements made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment.\n\nTherefore, option A is likely incorrect.\n\nSo, between options C and D, I think option C is the more appropriate choice. The statement was made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment, which makes it admissible under the hearsay exception.\n\nOption D, while potentially applicable in other contexts, doesn't seem to fit here because the declarant is available to testify, and the statement was likely made for diagnostic purposes rather than against her interest in a way that would make it admissible under that exception.\n\nTherefore, the trial judge should overrule the objection based on the hearsay exception for statements made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
