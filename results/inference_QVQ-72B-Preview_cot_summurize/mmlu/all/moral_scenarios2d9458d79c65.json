                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: I keep boxes of candy in my van because I have low blood sugar.\n\nOkay, so the person has low blood sugar and keeps candy in their van for quick access when they need a sugar boost. Now, having candy in your car for personal health reasons doesn't seem morally wrong. It's more of a practical solution to manage their health condition. Unless there's something illegal about having candy in your car, which I don't think there is, this should be fine. But maybe there's more to it. Maybe the candy is being used in a way that affects others, but the scenario doesn't specify that. So, based on the information given, keeping candy in the van for health reasons seems morally acceptable.\n\nSecond scenario: When I saw the neighbor undressing through the window, I pulled down the shade.\n\nHmm, this one feels more sensitive. So, the person saw their neighbor undressing through the window. That sounds like they might have been spying or peeping, which is generally considered invasive and wrong. But then they pulled down the shade, which seems like they're trying to prevent further viewing and respect the neighbor's privacy. So, there are two actions here: seeing the neighbor undressing and then pulling down the shade.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. Seeing the neighbor undressing: If the person intentionally looked into the neighbor's window to see them undressing, that's a clear violation of privacy and morally wrong. If, however, they accidentally saw something and quickly looked away or took action to prevent further viewing, that might be different.\n\n2. Pulling down the shade: This action seems corrective, like they realized what was happening and tried to stop it. This could be seen as a morally right thing to do, respecting the neighbor's privacy.\n\nBut overall, the initial act of seeing the neighbor undressing could be morally wrong, depending on the intent and context.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to consider the context more carefully. Was the person intentionally looking, or did they accidentally see something? The scenario doesn't specify, so I have to make an assumption based on ordinary moral standards.\n\nIn general, looking into someone's window without their consent, especially when they're changing clothes, is a breach of privacy and morally wrong. Pulling down the shade could be seen as correcting that wrong, but the initial act is still wrong.\n\nSo, for scenario one, keeping candy in the van for health reasons seems morally acceptable. For scenario two, even if the person pulled down the shade, the initial act of seeing the neighbor undressing could be morally wrong.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there's any wrongdoing in both scenarios.\n\nIn scenario one, keeping candy in the van for health reasons doesn't seem morally wrong. It's a personal health management strategy.\n\nIn scenario two, intentionally watching the neighbor undress is morally wrong, but if it was accidental and they immediately pulled down the shade, it might be less wrong, but still, seeing someone undress without consent is generally considered wrong.\n\nHowever, pulling down the shade shows an attempt to rectify the situation and respect the neighbor's privacy, which is morally good.\n\nBut overall, the initial act of seeing the neighbor undress is morally wrong, regardless of whether they pulled down the shade afterward.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, scenario one is not wrong, and scenario two is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nOption A is both wrong.\n\nOption B is first wrong, second not wrong.\n\nOption C is first not wrong, second wrong.\n\nOption D is both not wrong.\n\nGiven that scenario one seems morally acceptable, and scenario two involves a morally wrong act, C seems to be the correct choice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's more to consider.\n\nPerhaps in scenario one, keeping boxes of candy in the van could be seen as irresponsible if the candy is accessible to others or if it's against some regulation, but that seems like stretching. Generally, it's for personal health, so it's fine.\n\nIn scenario two, even if the person didn't intend to spy, seeing the neighbor undress is still a violation of privacy, making it morally wrong.\n\nThus, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
