                    "text": "So I've got this scenario where a woman is injured in an elevator accident in a commercial building, and she's suing the building's owner for negligence. The question is whether the trial judge should dismiss the case without letting it go to the jury, based on the evidence presented so far. The options are:\n\nA. Yes, because the injured person always has the affirmative burden of proving negligence.\n\nB. Yes, because it cannot be presumed that the building owner was negligent.\n\nC. No, because the elevator was under the owner's exclusive control and accidents of this nature do not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence.\n\nD. Yes, because the woman assumed the risk when she decided to use an obviously dangerous instrumentality.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First off, in a negligence case, the plaintiff generally has to prove four elements: duty, breach of duty, causation, and damages. The burden is on the plaintiff to establish these elements by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nOption A says that the injured person always has the affirmative burden of proving negligence. That sounds right, but let's see if there are any exceptions or special rules that might apply here.\n\nOption B says that it cannot be presumed that the building owner was negligent. Well, generally, negligence isn't presumed; the plaintiff has to prove it. But maybe there's a doctrine that allows for some presumption in certain circumstances.\n\nOption C says no, the case shouldn't be dismissed because the elevator was under the owner's exclusive control and such accidents don't ordinarily occur without negligence. This sounds like it might be referring to the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, which is Latin for \"the thing speaks for itself.\" Under this doctrine, in certain circumstances, negligence can be inferred from the facts without direct evidence of what went wrong.\n\nOption D says yes, the case should be dismissed because the woman assumed the risk by using an obviously dangerous instrumentality. Assumption of risk is a defense in negligence cases where the plaintiff knowingly and voluntarily exposes themselves to a hazard.\n\nAlright, so let's consider res ipsa loquitur first. For this doctrine to apply, typically, three conditions need to be met:\n\n1. The injury must be of a type that doesn't ordinarily occur without negligence.\n\n2. The instrumentality causing the injury must have been in the exclusive control of the defendant.\n\n3. There must be no contribution to the injury on the part of the plaintiff.\n\nIn this case, the elevator was owned and presumably maintained by the building owner. So, the elevator was under the owner's control. The injury occurred when the elevator malfunctioned and crashed to the basement from the third floor. It seems plausible that such an event doesn't ordinarily happen without some negligence in maintenance or inspection.\n\nSo, if res ipsa loquitur applies, then the plaintiff doesn't need to prove the specific act of negligence; the inference of negligence arises from the circumstances.\n\nNow, considering this, if res ipsa loquitur applies, it would be inappropriate to dismiss the case as a matter of law because there's an inference of negligence that the defendant would need to rebut.\n\nOn the other hand, if res ipsa loquitur doesn't apply, then the plaintiff would need to present specific evidence of negligence, and if she doesn't have any, the case could be dismissed.\n\nSo, the key here is whether res ipsa loquitur applies in this situation.\n\nLet me think about the first condition: the injury must be of a type that doesn't ordinarily occur without negligence.\n\nAn elevator crashing from the third floor to the basement seems like a pretty significant failure. Elevators are complex mechanical systems with safety features designed to prevent such accidents. If one assumes that these safety features are generally reliable, then an elevator crashing in this manner might not happen without some negligence in maintenance or operation.\n\nHowever, it's possible that there are other causes for such an accident that aren't necessarily due to negligence, like a manufacturing defect in the elevator itself, or perhaps an act of God like an earthquake, although that seems unlikely in this context.\n\nBut assuming that there's no evidence of such non-negligent causes, the inference of negligence could be drawn.\n\nThe second condition is that the instrumentality causing the injury was in the exclusive control of the defendant.\n\nThe elevator is part of the building, owned and maintained by the building owner. Unless there's evidence that someone else had control over the elevator's maintenance or operation, this condition seems met.\n\nThe third condition is that there was no contribution to the injury on the part of the plaintiff.\n\nThe woman was simply using the elevator for a business meeting; there's no indication that she did anything to contribute to the accident, like tampering with the elevator or overloading it beyond reasonable use.\n\nTherefore, if res ipsa loquitur applies, the plaintiff doesn't need to prove specific acts of negligence; the inference arises from the control of the instrumentality and the nature of the accident.\n\nNow, considering this, the trial judge shouldn't dismiss the case as a matter of law because there's an inference of negligence that the defendant would need to rebut.\n\nSo, option C seems correct: no, the case shouldn't be dismissed because the elevator was under the owner's exclusive control and accidents of this nature don't ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence.\n\nOption A says yes, because the injured person always has the affirmative burden of proving negligence. While generally true, in cases where res ipsa loquitur applies, the burden shifts somewhat, as negligence can be inferred from the circumstances.\n\nOption B says yes, because it cannot be presumed that the building owner was negligent. But if res ipsa loquitur applies, then negligence can be presumed from the circumstances.\n\nOption D says yes, because the woman assumed the risk by using an obviously dangerous instrumentality. But elevators are generally considered safe modes of transportation, especially in commercial buildings. Unless there was something obviously wrong with the elevator, which isn't indicated in the scenario, it's unlikely that the woman assumed the risk.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C: no, because the elevator was under the owner's exclusive control and accidents of this nature do not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
