                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this equation: y + 2.9 = 11. And I need to find out which value of y makes this equation true. The options are A. 8.1, B. 8.9, C. 9.1, and D. 13.9.\n\nOkay, so to solve for y, I need to get y by itself on one side of the equation. That means I should subtract 2.9 from both sides, right? Let's try that.\n\nSo, y + 2.9 - 2.9 = 11 - 2.9.\n\nThat simplifies to y = 8.1.\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check that.\n\nIf y = 8.1, then plugging it back into the equation: 8.1 + 2.9 equals 11.\n\nYes, that's correct. 8.1 + 2.9 = 11.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check the other options just to be sure.\n\nOption B is 8.9. If y = 8.9, then 8.9 + 2.9 = 11.8, which is not equal to 11. So, that's not correct.\n\nOption C is 9.1. So, 9.1 + 2.9 = 12, which is not equal to 11. So, that's wrong too.\n\nOption D is 13.9. 13.9 + 2.9 = 16.8, which is definitely not equal to 11.\n\nSo, based on this, option A, 8.1, is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me think about another way to approach this. Maybe I can use mental math right from the start.\n\nI know that 2.9 plus something equals 11. So, if I think about 2.9 plus 8.1, that should be 11 because 2 + 8 is 10, and 0.9 + 0.1 is 1, so 10 + 1 equals 11.\n\nYeah, that matches up with what I got earlier.\n\nI don't think there's any other complicated way to do this. It seems pretty straightforward.\n\nMaybe I should consider if there's any trick to this question. Is there any possibility of multiple answers being correct or something like that?\n\nNo, the question is clear: \"What value of y makes y + 2.9 = 11 true?\" And the options are distinct, so I don't think there's any trickery here.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll plug in the correct value again: y = 8.1, so 8.1 + 2.9 = 11. Yes, that checks out.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 8.1} \\]"
