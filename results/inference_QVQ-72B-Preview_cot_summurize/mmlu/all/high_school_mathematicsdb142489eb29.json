                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: a number \\( x \\) equals \\( 2^{15} \\cdot 3^6 \\), and I need to find a number whose cube equals \\( x \\). The options are 288, 27, 125, and 121. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a number's cube to equal \\( x \\). That means I'm looking for a number, let's call it \\( y \\), such that \\( y^3 = x \\). So, essentially, \\( y = \\sqrt[3]{x} \\). Given that \\( x = 2^{15} \\cdot 3^6 \\), I can express \\( y \\) in terms of exponents as well.\n\nLet me recall that when you take the cube root of a number with an exponent, you divide the exponent by 3. So, \\( \\sqrt[3]{2^{15}} = 2^{15/3} = 2^5 \\), and \\( \\sqrt[3]{3^6} = 3^{6/3} = 3^2 \\). Therefore, \\( y = 2^5 \\cdot 3^2 \\).\n\nNow, calculating \\( 2^5 \\) is straightforward: \\( 2^5 = 32 \\). And \\( 3^2 \\) is 9. So, \\( y = 32 \\cdot 9 \\). Let me compute that: 32 times 9.\n\nWell, 30 times 9 is 270, and 2 times 9 is 18, so adding those together gives 270 + 18 = 288. Wait a minute, 288 is one of the options. So, is the answer 288?\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from \\( x = 2^{15} \\cdot 3^6 \\), and \\( y^3 = x \\), so \\( y = \\sqrt[3]{x} \\). Yes, and breaking it down, \\( \\sqrt[3]{2^{15}} = 2^{5} \\), and \\( \\sqrt[3]{3^6} = 3^{2} \\), so indeed, \\( y = 2^5 \\cdot 3^2 = 32 \\cdot 9 = 288 \\).\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's verify by cubing 288 and seeing if it equals \\( x \\). So, \\( 288^3 \\). Hmm, that might be a bit tedious to calculate directly, but since \\( y = 2^5 \\cdot 3^2 \\), and \\( x = 2^{15} \\cdot 3^6 \\), cubing \\( y \\) should give \\( (2^5)^3 \\cdot (3^2)^3 = 2^{15} \\cdot 3^6 \\), which matches \\( x \\). So, that checks out.\n\nWait, but let's see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can consider that the number whose cube is \\( x \\) could have its own prime factorization. Since \\( x = 2^{15} \\cdot 3^6 \\), and \\( y^3 = x \\), then the exponents of the prime factors in \\( y \\) should be one-third of those in \\( x \\), which is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the options and see which one, when cubed, gives \\( x \\). For example, take 288: \\( 288 = 2^5 \\cdot 3^2 \\), as I calculated before. Cubing it: \\( 288^3 = (2^5 \\cdot 3^2)^3 = 2^{15} \\cdot 3^6 \\), which matches \\( x \\). So, that seems consistent.\n\nWhat about the other options? Let's check 27. \\( 27 = 3^3 \\), and \\( 27^3 = 3^9 \\). But \\( x = 2^{15} \\cdot 3^6 \\), so \\( 27^3 \\) is only \\( 3^9 \\), which doesn't match \\( x \\).\n\nNext, 125. \\( 125 = 5^3 \\), and \\( 125^3 = 5^9 \\). \\( x \\) has no factor of 5, so this can't be it.\n\nLastly, 121. \\( 121 = 11^2 \\), and \\( 121^3 = 11^6 \\). Again, \\( x \\) doesn't have a factor of 11, so this doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the only option that fits is 288.\n\nWait a second, maybe I should consider if there are any other factors in \\( y \\). For example, could \\( y \\) have other prime factors besides 2 and 3? Well, since \\( x \\) only has prime factors of 2 and 3, \\( y \\) should also only have prime factors of 2 and 3, because any other prime factors would introduce new primes into \\( y^3 \\), which wouldn't match \\( x \\). So, no, \\( y \\) should only have 2 and 3 as its prime factors.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to factor \\( x \\) completely and then take the cube root of each prime's exponent. So, \\( x = 2^{15} \\cdot 3^6 \\), and \\( y = \\sqrt[3]{x} = 2^{15/3} \\cdot 3^{6/3} = 2^5 \\cdot 3^2 = 32 \\cdot 9 = 288 \\). This seems solid.\n\nLet me try another approach. Suppose \\( y = a \\cdot b \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are integers. Then, \\( y^3 = a^3 \\cdot b^3 \\). For this to equal \\( x = 2^{15} \\cdot 3^6 \\), \\( a^3 \\) should be \\( 2^{15} \\), and \\( b^3 \\) should be \\( 3^6 \\). So, \\( a = 2^{15/3} = 2^5 = 32 \\), and \\( b = 3^{6/3} = 3^2 = 9 \\). Therefore, \\( y = a \\cdot b = 32 \\cdot 9 = 288 \\). Again, this confirms the earlier result.\n\nI think I've covered a few different ways to arrive at the answer, and they all point to 288 being the correct choice. So, I'm confident that 288 is the number whose cube equals \\( x \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{288} \\]"
