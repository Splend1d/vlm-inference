Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the \u0153cumenical position, the \u0153cumenical traditions, of Rome&\u2026.\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\nEdward A.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about a passage from Edward A. Freeman's \"The Chief Periods of European History\" from 1885. It's talking about the unification of Italy and how Rome became the capital of Italy. The question is asking about the author's feelings towards the results of a major European political movement in the nineteenth century. The options are Romanticism, Socialism, Conservatism, and Nationalism.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the passage. It seems like Freeman is discussing the unification of Italy, which happened in the 19th century, and expressing some mixed feelings about it. He mentions that Italy was finally united, and everyone rejoiced in its union. But then he says that maybe the union was too quick and too thorough. He particularly mentions the treatment of Sicily, saying that its name is no longer even a geographical expression and that it's now just seven provinces of the mainland kingdom.\n\nHe also talks about how Rome, which used to be a significant independent entity, is now just part of Italy, and its status has changed. Freeman refers to the entry of the Italian army into liberated Rome and how this marked the end of a significant phase in European history. He seems to appreciate the idea of Rome being the capital of Italy but also feels that this formally ended Rome's imperial traditions and its broader, perhaps more universal, role in European history.\n\nSo, the passage is reflecting on the impacts of Italian unification, both positively and negatively. Now, the question is about the author's feelings towards the results of a major European political movement of the nineteenth century. Given that the passage is about Italian unification, which was a significant part of the broader movement of nationalism in Europe during that time, it seems relevant.\n\nLet me recall what nationalism entails. Nationalism is a political ideology that emphasizes the cultural unity of a people and seeks to preserve or create a state that represents that people. In the 19th century, nationalism played a crucial role in the unification of countries like Italy and Germany, which were previously divided into smaller states.\n\nIn the case of Italy, nationalism fueled the Risorgimento, the movement that led to the unification of the Italian peninsula into a single nation-state. This process involved various political and military actions, including the involvement of figures like Giuseppe Garibaldi and Camillo Benso di Cavour, and the support of other European powers at different times.\n\nFreeman's passage seems to acknowledge the positive aspect of Italian unification\u2014the creation of a unified nation\u2014but also expresses some regrets about the loss of certain historical identities and the end of Rome's unique position as a universal center.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Romanticism: Romanticism was an artistic and intellectual movement that emphasized emotion, individualism, and the beauty of nature. While it had political implications, it's not directly associated with the political movement of unification like nationalism is.\n\nB. Socialism: Socialism is an economic and political theory advocating for public ownership of the means of production and distribution of goods. While it gained prominence in the 19th century, it's not directly linked to the unification of Italy in the way nationalism is.\n\nC. Conservatism: Conservatism is a political ideology that emphasizes tradition, stability, and preservation of existing social institutions. While conservatives might have had mixed reactions to unification movements, the unification of Italy was more driven by nationalist sentiments than conservative ones.\n\nD. Nationalism: As discussed, nationalism was the driving force behind the unification of Italy.\n\nGiven this context, it seems that the correct answer should be D. Nationalism.\n\nBut the question is phrased slightly differently. It says, \"the author expresses bittersweet feelings about the results of what major European political movement of the nineteenth century?\" So, it's not just about identifying the movement but recognizing that Freeman has mixed feelings about its results.\n\nFrom the passage, Freeman does seem to have mixed emotions. On one hand, he rejoices in the unification of Italy and the establishment of Rome as its capital. On the other hand, he laments the loss of certain historical identities and the end of Rome's imperial traditions.\n\nSo, he appreciates the achievements of nationalism in unifying Italy but also regrets some of the consequences, such as the submergence of regional identities like Sicily's and the change in Rome's status.\n\nTherefore, his feelings are bittersweet regarding the results of nationalism.\n\nI don't think Romanticism, Socialism, or Conservatism directly align with the content of the passage or the emotions expressed by Freeman.\n\nTo make sure, let's consider each option again:\n\nA. Romanticism: While Romanticism could evoke emotional responses, it's not a political movement primarily concerned with national unification.\n\nB. Socialism: This movement focuses on economic equality and class struggles, which aren't the main themes in the passage.\n\nC. Conservatism: Conservatives might have had mixed feelings about unification, but again, the unification was driven by nationalist sentiments, not conservative ideology.\n\nD. Nationalism: This is the movement that directly relates to the unification of Italy and the establishment of Rome as the capital.\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer should be D. Nationalism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
