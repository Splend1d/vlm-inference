                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what Stevenson's main goal is in this paper. The options are:\n\nA. Provide an account of what makes right actions right.\n\nB. Establish which things are good in themselves.\n\nC. Develop a theory of good moral character.\n\nD. Make ethical questions clear.\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who Stevenson is. I think he's associated with ethical subjectivism or emotivism, right? Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, Stevenson was an ethical subjectivist. He believed that moral judgments express our emotions and attitudes rather than describing objective facts.\n\nGiven that background, his primary aim might be related to how we understand and express our moral judgments, perhaps focusing on the clarity of ethical questions.\n\nOption D says \"make ethical questions clear.\" That sounds plausible because if he's an ethical subjectivist, he might be interested in clarifying how moral language works and what moral statements really do.\n\nBut let's consider the other options as well.\n\nOption A: \"provide an account of what makes right actions right.\" This seems more aligned with moral realism or deontological ethics, where there's a focus on the criteria that make actions right or wrong. Stevenson, being a subjectivist, might not be primarily concerned with establishing objective standards for right actions.\n\nOption B: \"establish which things are good in themselves.\" This sounds like it's about intrinsic value, which is a central concern in teleological or virtue ethics. Again, Stevenson's subjectivism might not prioritize establishing intrinsic goodness independently of human emotions or attitudes.\n\nOption C: \"develop a theory of good moral character.\" This is more in line with virtue ethics, which focuses on character traits and virtues. Stevenson's approach, while it does touch on attitudes and emotions, isn't primarily about developing a theory of character.\n\nGiven this analysis, option D seems the most fitting. By making ethical questions clear, Stevenson would be aiming to clarify the nature of moral discourse and the function of moral statements, which aligns well with his subjectivist position.\n\nBut wait, let's think deeper. Could his aim be to provide a foundation for moral discourse by clarifying what moral statements mean? If so, that would indeed involve making ethical questions clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe his aim is to resolve confusion about moral language, ensuring that when people make moral judgments, they understand that they're expressing emotions rather than making factual claims.\n\nThat seems consistent with option D. By making ethical questions clear, he's helping to resolve misunderstandings about the nature of moral statements.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possibility that another option could be correct.\n\nFor instance, option A: providing an account of what makes right actions right. If Stevenson were to argue that right actions are those that align with our emotional approvals or are consistent with certain moral sentiments, that could be seen as providing an account of rightness. However, this seems secondary to his main project of understanding the nature of moral judgments themselves.\n\nSimilarly, option B: establishing which things are good in themselves. This seems more aligned with a realist or objectivist approach to ethics, which Stevenson would likely disagree with, as he thought that goodness is not an intrinsic property but a projection of our emotions.\n\nOption C: developing a theory of good moral character. While Stevenson's work might have implications for understanding moral character, his primary focus seems to be on the expression and persuasion in moral discourse rather than on defining virtues or character traits.\n\nTherefore, after considering all the options, I believe that Stevenson's primary aim in this paper is to make ethical questions clear, which corresponds to option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
