                    "text": "So I need to figure out West's AMT tax preference items. I'm a bit rusty on AMT rules, but I remember that AMT, or Alternative Minimum Tax, is a parallel tax system in the U.S. that ensures that taxpayers with certain income benefits pay a minimum amount of tax. AMT preferences are items that are treated differently under AMT rules compared to regular tax rules and can increase or decrease your taxable income for AMT purposes.\n\nFrom the information given, West has:\n\n- Long-term capital gain: $15,000\n\n- Percentage depletion in excess of property's adjusted basis: $9,000\n\n- Dividends from publicly-held companies: $10,000\n\nAnd he's single, has no dependents, and does not itemize deductions.\n\nFirst, I need to recall which of these items are AMT preferences.\n\nI know that long-term capital gains are generally treated the same for regular tax and AMT purposes, so they shouldn't be an AMT preference item.\n\nPercentage depletion in excess of the property's adjusted basis\u2014that sounds like it might be an AMT preference. I think that for AMT purposes, percentage depletion is allowed only to the extent of the adjusted basis of the property. So, if a taxpayer claims percentage depletion that exceeds the adjusted basis, that excess is an AMT preference item. Since West has $9,000 of percentage depletion in excess of the property's adjusted basis, that should be added back to his AMT income.\n\nNext, dividends from publicly-held companies. Normally, dividends are taxable both under regular tax and AMT. However, there might be some differences in how they're treated, but I don't recall any specific AMT preferences related to dividends.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's an exclusion or something for dividends under AMT. Let me think\u2014no, I don't think so. Dividends are generally taxable under both systems without any preference adjustments.\n\nSo, based on this, the only AMT preference item from the list provided is the percentage depletion in excess of the property's adjusted basis, which is $9,000.\n\nBut let's double-check. Is there any chance that long-term capital gains or dividends could be AMT preference items under certain circumstances?\n\nFor long-term capital gains, I'm pretty sure they're treated the same under both regular tax and AMT. So, no adjustment there.\n\nFor dividends, again, I don't think there's any difference in treatment between regular tax and AMT. So, no preference item there either.\n\nTherefore, the AMT preference item for West should be $9,000, which corresponds to option A.\n\nBut wait, let's see if there's any possibility of other preferences or exemptions that might apply.\n\nSince West is single with no dependents and does not itemize, his standard deduction would apply for regular tax purposes. For AMT, the standard deduction is higher than for regular tax, but since he doesn't itemize, that might not directly affect his AMT preferences.\n\nAlso, there are AMT exemptions based on income levels, but those would affect his AMT liability rather than his preference items.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the only AMT preference item is the $9,000 percentage depletion in excess of the property's adjusted basis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. $9,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
