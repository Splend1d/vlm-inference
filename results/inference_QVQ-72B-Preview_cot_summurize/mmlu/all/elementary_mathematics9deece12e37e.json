                    "text": "Let's see here. The practice range charges $4.00 for a bucket of 40 golf balls. I need to find out how much a bucket of 100 golf balls would cost at the same rate. Okay, so first I need to understand the relationship between the number of golf balls and the cost.\n\nI know that 40 golf balls cost $4.00. So, if I can find out the cost per golf ball, then I can multiply that by 100 to get the cost for 100 golf balls. That sounds like a plan.\n\nFirst, let's find the cost per golf ball. If 40 golf balls cost $4.00, then the cost per golf ball is $4.00 divided by 40. Let me calculate that:\n\n$4.00 \u00f7 40 = $0.10 per golf ball.\n\nSo, each golf ball costs $0.10.\n\nNow, to find the cost for 100 golf balls, I'll multiply the cost per golf ball by 100.\n\n$0.10 \u00d7 100 = $10.00.\n\nSo, it should cost $10.00 for a bucket of 100 golf balls.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check if there's another way to look at it.\n\nAnother approach could be to see how many times 40 goes into 100. If 40 golf balls cost $4.00, then for 100 golf balls, I can find out how many sets of 40 are in 100 and multiply that by $4.00.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n100 \u00f7 40 = 2.5.\n\nSo, 100 is 2.5 times 40. Therefore, the cost would be 2.5 times $4.00.\n\n2.5 \u00d7 $4.00 = $10.00.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous answer. Good, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the ratio of golf balls to cost. If 40 balls cost $4.00, then for 100 balls, which is 2.5 times more balls, the cost should be 2.5 times more. Again, that brings me to $10.00.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other factor that might affect the cost.\n\nIs there any possibility of a volume discount or something like that? Well, the problem says \"at this rate,\" so I assume that the rate remains constant, and there are no discounts or increases based on the quantity.\n\nAlso, the options provided are:\n\nA. $10.00\n\nB. $10.50\n\nC. $13.50\n\nD. $16.00\n\nMy calculation points to option A. $10.00.\n\nI don't see any reason why it would be different, unless there's some other information I'm missing, but based on what's given, $10.00 seems correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try one more way.\n\nI can set up a proportion: 40 balls / $4.00 = 100 balls / x\n\nThen, cross-multiplying: 40 * x = 100 * $4.00\n\n40x = $400.00\n\nNow, divide both sides by 40:\n\nx = $400.00 \u00f7 40\n\nx = $10.00\n\nOkay, that confirms it again.\n\nI think I've covered a few different ways to approach this, and all of them lead me to the same conclusion: the cost for 100 golf balls is $10.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ \\$10.00} \\]"
