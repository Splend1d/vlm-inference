                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I called the cops on the band for assaulting the crowd.\n\nScenario 2: I put on a bulletproof vest to protect myself when I commit a bank robbery.\n\nAnd the question is asking which of these actions is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nOkay, so let's consider Scenario 1. Someone called the cops on a band because they were assaulting the crowd. Now, assault is generally considered a crime, right? It's using force or threatening to use force against someone else without their consent. So, if a band is assaulting the crowd, that means they're physically attacking or threatening the audience. Calling the cops on someone who is committing a crime like assault seems like the right thing to do. It's reporting a crime to the authorities, which is generally seen as a responsible action. So, in this case, calling the cops isn't morally wrong; it's actually morally right.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2. Someone puts on a bulletproof vest to protect themselves when they commit a bank robbery. Okay, so first off, bank robbery is a serious crime. It involves stealing money from a bank, which is against the law and carries heavy penalties. Moreover, using a bulletproof vest to protect oneself during the commission of a crime seems like an attempt to evade or reduce the risks associated with getting caught. But the act itself\u2014putting on a bulletproof vest\u2014isn't inherently moral or immoral; it's the intention behind it that matters. In this context, the intention is to commit a bank robbery, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Calling the cops on a band for assaulting the crowd is not morally wrong; in fact, it's the right thing to do.\n\n- Scenario 2: Putting on a bulletproof vest to commit a bank robbery is morally wrong because bank robbery is a serious crime.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut wait a minute, let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, is there any chance that calling the cops could be considered wrong? Well, perhaps if the person misreported the incident or if the band wasn't actually assaulting the crowd, but the scenario says they were assaulting the crowd. So, assuming the person is reporting accurately, calling the cops is the right action.\n\nIn Scenario 2, is wearing a bulletproof vest inherently wrong? No, not necessarily. Bulletproof vests are often used by law enforcement and civilians for legitimate protective purposes. However, in the context of committing a bank robbery, which is a criminal act, it becomes morally tainted. So, yes, it's morally wrong in this context.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
