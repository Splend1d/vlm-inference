                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem here: \"The symbol \\(5!\\) means \\(5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1\\). What is the greatest odd integer that is a factor of \\(5!\\)?\"\n\nOkay, so first things first, \\(5!\\) is 5 factorial, which is \\(5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\\). The question is asking for the greatest odd integer that divides 120 without leaving a remainder.\n\nAlright, so to find the greatest odd factor of 120, I need to factorize 120 into its prime factors and then see what combinations of these factors give me odd numbers.\n\nLet me start by factorizing 120.\n\n120 divided by 2 is 60.\n\n60 divided by 2 is 30.\n\n30 divided by 2 is 15.\n\n15 is 3 times 5.\n\nSo, the prime factors of 120 are 2, 2, 2, 3, and 5.\n\nWait, but in exponential form, that's \\(2^3 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1\\).\n\nNow, for the number to be odd, it cannot have any factors of 2. So, I need to exclude all the 2's from the factorization when forming the odd factors.\n\nSo, the odd factors will be made up of the primes 3 and 5, with any combination of their powers.\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n1. \\(3^0 \\times 5^0 = 1\\)\n\n2. \\(3^1 \\times 5^0 = 3\\)\n\n3. \\(3^0 \\times 5^1 = 5\\)\n\n4. \\(3^1 \\times 5^1 = 15\\)\n\nSo, the odd factors of 120 are 1, 3, 5, and 15.\n\nAmong these, the greatest one is 15.\n\nWait a minute, but the options given are:\n\nA. 5\n\nB. 3\n\nC. 15\n\nD. 31\n\nSo, according to my calculation, the answer should be C. 15.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, I confirmed that 15 is indeed a factor of 120. Since \\(8 \\times 15 = 120\\), yes, 15 divides 120 evenly.\n\nNow, is there any larger odd number that divides 120?\n\nWell, 15 is the largest combination of the odd prime factors 3 and 5.\n\nIf I try to include higher powers of 3 or 5, like \\(3^2 = 9\\), but 9 doesn't divide 120 because \\(120 / 9 = 13.333\\), which is not an integer.\n\nSimilarly, \\(5^2 = 25\\), and 25 doesn't divide 120 because \\(120 / 25 = 4.8\\), not an integer.\n\nSo, combining 3 and 5 gives 15, which is the largest odd factor.\n\nWait, but option D is 31, which is larger than 15, but is 31 a factor of 120?\n\nLet's check: \\(120 / 31 = 3.87\\), which is not an integer, so 31 is not a factor of 120.\n\nTherefore, the greatest odd factor is indeed 15.\n\nMaybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could list all the factors of 120 and pick the largest odd one.\n\nFactors of 120:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.\n\nFrom this list, the odd factors are 1, 3, 5, and 15.\n\nSo, again, 15 is the largest odd factor.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 15.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
