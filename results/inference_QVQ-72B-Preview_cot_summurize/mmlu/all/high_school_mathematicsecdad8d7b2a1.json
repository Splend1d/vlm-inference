                    "text": "So I've got this problem about a figure skater spinning, and I need to figure out which direction she's facing after spinning 2250 degrees. She starts facing north and spins to her right. The options are north, east, south, or west. Hmm, I think I can work this out, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a full circle is 360 degrees. So, if she spins 360 degrees, she should be facing the same direction she started, which is north. But she spun 2250 degrees, which is way more than 360. Maybe I can see how many full circles she did and then see what's left over.\n\nLet me divide 2250 by 360 to see how many full circles are in that degree measure. 2250 divided by 360 is, let's see, 360 times 6 is 2160, and 2250 minus 2160 is 90 degrees. So, she did 6 full spins (which bring her back to north each time) and then an additional 90 degrees.\n\nWait, but she's spinning to her right. I need to make sure I understand which way she's spinning. If she's facing north and spins to her right, that should be clockwise. Yeah, I think so. So, spinning to her right means clockwise rotation.\n\nNow, if she spins 90 degrees clockwise from north, which way does she face? Let me visualize this. Starting facing north, spinning 90 degrees clockwise would bring her to east.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. North to east is indeed a 90-degree turn to the right. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo, after 6 full spins, which don't change her direction, and then an additional 90 degrees clockwise, she ends up facing east.\n\nI think that's the answer, but just to be sure, maybe there's another way to look at it. Maybe using modular arithmetic or something.\n\nOkay, so mathematically, I can think of the total rotation as 2250 degrees, and since full circles don't change the direction, I can find the equivalent angle between 0 and 360 degrees by taking 2250 modulo 360.\n\nSo, 2250 mod 360. Let's calculate that. 360 times 6 is 2160, and 2250 minus 2160 is 90, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, since each 90 degrees corresponds to a change in direction, and spinning to the right is clockwise, the sequence would be north to east, east to south, south to west, and west to north, repeating every 360 degrees.\n\nSo, starting at north and spinning 90 degrees clockwise should indeed point her to east.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about negative rotations or something, but in this case, since she's spinning to her right, which is clockwise, positive angles should be in the direction she's spinning.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here; it seems straightforward. So, I'm confident that the answer is east.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. east}} \\]"
