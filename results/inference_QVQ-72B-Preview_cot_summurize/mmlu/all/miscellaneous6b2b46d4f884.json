Meriwether and William\n\nC. Cabot and Joseph\n\nD. Meredith and George\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall who Lewis and Clark were and what they're famous for. I remember that they led an expedition from 1804 to 1806, exploring the western part of the United States, from St. Louis all the way to the Pacific Ocean. It was a big deal because they were mapping the territory and collecting information about the land, the people, and the wildlife.\n\nNow, their last names are Lewis and Clark, but the question is asking for their first names. I think one of them was named Meriwether, but I'm not sure which one. Let me see if I can match that with the options.\n\nOption B says Meriwether and William. If Meriwether was one of them, then William might be the other one. But I think I've heard of Meriwether Lewis, so maybe Meriwether is Lewis's first name, and then Clark's first name is William? That seems plausible.\n\nBut wait, I think Clark's first name is William, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me consider the other options.\n\nOption A is Morgan and Mason. That doesn't ring a bell. I don't recall either of them being named Morgan or Mason.\n\nOption C is Cabot and Joseph. Again, I don't remember those names associated with Lewis and Clark.\n\nOption D is Meredith and George. Hmm, that also doesn't seem right.\n\nSo, by process of elimination, option B seems the most likely. Meriwether and William. But I want to make sure I'm not missing something here.\n\nLet me double-check my memory. I think Meriwether was Lewis's first name. Yeah, Meriwether Lewis. And then Clark, I believe his first name is William. So, that would make sense.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'm going to think about any possible confusion. Was there another explorer with a similar name or someone who might have been part of their expedition?\n\nFor example, Sacagawea was a Shoshone woman who played a significant role in their journey, but she's not being referred to here. Or York, who was an African American explorer and a member of the expedition. But neither of them has the first names listed in the options.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty confident that the correct answer is B. Meriwether and William.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
