                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a nongovernmental, not-for-profit organization that has some investments in stocks. They have two different stocks: Stock A and Stock B. For each stock, they've provided the number of shares, the cost per share, the fair value at the beginning of the year, and the fair value at the end of the year. The question is asking what amount of stock investments should be reported in the year-end statement of financial position, and there are four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a statement of financial position is. I believe it's similar to a balance sheet for businesses, where it shows the assets, liabilities, and net assets of the organization at a specific point in time. So, the stock investments would be considered an asset on this statement.\n\nNow, for each stock, I need to figure out what value to use for the year-end statement. The options are cost, fair value at the beginning of the year, or fair value at the end of the year. Since it's a not-for-profit organization, I need to recall the accounting principles that apply to such organizations regarding investment valuations.\n\nI recall that for nongovernmental not-for-profit organizations, investments are typically carried at fair value on the balance sheet. So, the fair value at the end of the year should be used for reporting purposes.\n\nLet me confirm that. If an organization receives an investment, say, in the form of stock, they initially record it at fair value. Subsequently, they adjust the value to reflect market changes at each reporting period. Therefore, the fair value at the end of the year should be the amount reported.\n\nSo, for Stock A, they have 100 shares, and the fair value at the end of the year is $51 per share. Therefore, the total value for Stock A would be 100 shares times $51, which is $5,100.\n\nFor Stock B, they have 200 shares, and the fair value at the end of the year is $49 per share. So, the total value for Stock B would be 200 shares times $49, which is $9,800.\n\nTo find the total amount of stock investments to be reported, I need to add the total value of Stock A and Stock B. That would be $5,100 plus $9,800, which equals $14,900.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. $12,700\n\nB. $13,000\n\nC. $13,800\n\nD. $14,900\n\nIt seems that $14,900 is one of the options, which matches my calculation.\n\nHowever, I should double-check if there's any other consideration I might have missed. For example, if the organization intended to sell the investments within a certain period or if there are any restrictions on the investments.\n\nBut the problem doesn't provide any additional information about restrictions or the organization's intentions regarding the investments. So, based on the information given, using the fair value at the end of the year seems appropriate.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the organization uses the cost method or the fair value method for reporting investments. But as I recall, for financial assets, nongovernmental not-for-profit organizations are required to measure them at fair value under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nTherefore, unless there's a specific exception or restriction that isn't mentioned in the problem, the fair value at the end of the year should be used.\n\nLet me also consider if there's any possibility of using the cost basis. If the organization had elected the fair value option, which seems likely given the information provided, then fair value would be used. Alternatively, if the investments were considered permanently restricted, they might be reported at fair value as well.\n\nGiven that it's a not-for-profit organization, and the investments are likely considered permanently restricted net assets, but again, the problem specifies that it's a nongovernmental, not-for-profit organization, and provides specific investment details, so using fair value makes sense.\n\nMoreover, the problem is straightforward in providing the fair values at the beginning and end of the year, suggesting that fair value is the relevant metric here.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is $14,900, which corresponds to option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
