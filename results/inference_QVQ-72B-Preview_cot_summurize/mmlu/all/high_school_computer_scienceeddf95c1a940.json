It supports automatic garbage collection.\n\nB. It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.\n\nC. Both of the above.\n\nD. None of the above.\n\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each option is claiming about Python.\n\nStarting with option A: \"It supports automatic garbage collection.\"\n\nI remember that garbage collection is a process in programming languages where the memory management is handled automatically by the language's runtime environment. It identifies and reclaims memory that is no longer in use by the program. So, in languages that support garbage collection, you don't have to manually manage memory allocation and deallocation, which can help prevent memory leaks and other issues.\n\nNow, Python is a high-level programming language that is designed to be easy to read and write. One of its key features is its simplicity and readability, which makes it popular for a wide range of applications, from web development to data science.\n\nBut does Python support automatic garbage collection? From what I recall, Python does indeed have a garbage collector that runs automatically. It uses a combination of reference counting and a cycle detector to manage memory. Reference counting is a way to track how many references point to a particular object, and when the reference count drops to zero, the object is considered unreachable and is collected. Additionally, Python has a cycle collector that can handle situations where objects are referenced in cycles, which reference counting alone cannot handle.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems to be correct.\n\nMoving on to option B: \"It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.\"\n\nThis is quite a list. Python is known for its ability to integrate with other languages and technologies, which is one of its strengths. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, C and C++: Python has C APIs that allow you to write extensions in C or C++. This is commonly used to speed up parts of a Python program that are performance-critical or to reuse existing C/C++ code.\n\nNext, COM and ActiveX: These are technologies primarily associated with Microsoft Windows for component-based software. Python has libraries like PyWin32 that provide support for COM and ActiveX, allowing Python programs to use COM components and ActiveX controls.\n\nThen, CORBA: The Common Object Request Broker Architecture is a standard for building distributed applications. Python has libraries like OmnicORBpy that allow it to work with CORBA services.\n\nFinally, Java: Python can interact with Java code through tools like Jython, which is a version of Python that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), or through libraries like JPype, which allows Python to interact with Java objects.\n\nFrom what I know, Python does have ways to integrate with all these technologies, though the ease of integration might vary depending on the specific use case and the availability of well-maintained libraries or tools.\n\nSo, option B also seems to be correct.\n\nIf both options A and B are correct, then the answer should be C: Both of the above.\n\nBut just to make sure, I should double-check if there's any chance that one of these statements might not be entirely accurate.\n\nLet me start by confirming option A again. Yes, Python does have automatic garbage collection. It's built into the language, and as a Python programmer, you generally don't have to worry about manually managing memory allocation and deallocation.\n\nFor option B, while Python can integrate with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java, there might be some nuances or limitations depending on the specific integration method used. However, in general, it's safe to say that Python can be easily integrated with these technologies, given the availability of appropriate libraries and tools.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct answer is C: Both of the above.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
