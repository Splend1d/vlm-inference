                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to factor this expression: 36 - 9x\u00b2. Hmm, it looks like it's a difference of squares, right? I remember that a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 can be factored into (a - b)(a + b). Maybe I can apply that here.\n\nFirst, I should identify what a and b are in this expression. So, 36 is 6\u00b2, and 9x\u00b2 is (3x)\u00b2. So, a = 6 and b = 3x. Plugging into the formula, I get (6 - 3x)(6 + 3x). That seems straightforward, but let's check if there's any common factor I can factor out first.\n\nI notice that both terms in the expression have a common factor of 9. Maybe I should factor out 9 first. So, 36 - 9x\u00b2 = 9(4 - x\u00b2). Now, 4 - x\u00b2 is also a difference of squares, where a = 2 and b = x, so it can be factored into (2 - x)(2 + x). Therefore, the entire expression becomes 9(2 - x)(2 + x). That seems like a valid factorization.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. (6 - 3x)(6 + 3x)\n\nB. (-3x + 6)(3x + 6)\n\nC. 9(2 - x)(2 + x)\n\nD. 3(2 + x)\u00b2\n\nSo, option C matches my second factorization, but option A also seems related. I need to decide which one is more accurate.\n\nLet me expand both to see if they match the original expression.\n\nFirst, expand (6 - 3x)(6 + 3x):\n\n6*6 + 6*3x - 3x*6 - 3x*3x = 36 + 18x - 18x - 9x\u00b2 = 36 - 9x\u00b2. Okay, that matches.\n\nNow, expand 9(2 - x)(2 + x):\n\nFirst, (2 - x)(2 + x) = 4 + 2x - 2x - x\u00b2 = 4 - x\u00b2. Then, 9(4 - x\u00b2) = 36 - 9x\u00b2. That also matches.\n\nOption B: (-3x + 6)(3x + 6). Let's see: that's the same as (6 - 3x)(6 + 3x), just rearranged. So, that should also equal 36 - 9x\u00b2.\n\nOption D: 3(2 + x)\u00b2. Expanding (2 + x)\u00b2 gives 4 + 4x + x\u00b2. Multiplying by 3: 12 + 12x + 3x\u00b2. That doesn't match the original expression.\n\nSo, options A, B, and C seem to work, while D does not.\n\nBut between A, B, and C, which one is the best answer?\n\nOption A is (6 - 3x)(6 + 3x). That's a direct factorization, but it doesn't have any common factors factored out.\n\nOption B is (-3x + 6)(3x + 6), which is the same as option A, just rearranged.\n\nOption C is 9(2 - x)(2 + x), which factors out a 9 and keeps the difference of squares in terms of 2 and x.\n\nOption C seems more completely factored because it takes out the greatest common factor first. So, I think option C is the most appropriate factorization.\n\nLet me double-check. If I factor out 9 from 36 - 9x\u00b2, I get 9(4 - x\u00b2), and 4 - x\u00b2 is (2 - x)(2 + x), so yes, 9(2 - x)(2 + x) is correct.\n\nAlternatively, leaving it as (6 - 3x)(6 + 3x) is also correct, but it's not as simplified because it doesn't factor out the common 9.\n\nOption B is essentially the same as option A, just written differently.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is option C: 9(2 - x)(2 + x).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
