                    "text": "Alright, I've got this problem about sorting algorithms, specifically insertion sort and selection sort. I need to figure out which statement is true based on the given options. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how insertion sort and selection sort work.\n\n**Insertion Sort:**\n\n- It builds the final sorted array one item at a time.\n\n- It iterates through the array, and for each element, it finds the correct position in the already sorted part of the array and inserts it there.\n\n- This involves shifting elements to make room for the new element.\n\n**Selection Sort:**\n\n- It divides the input array into two parts: the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end.\n\n- It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the end of the sorted part.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\n**Option A: If the array is initially sorted in descending order, then insertion sort will be more efficient than selection sort.**\n\n- When the array is sorted in descending order, insertion sort will have to shift a lot of elements for each insertion because each new element needs to be moved to the beginning of the sorted part.\n\n- Selection sort, on the other hand, will still perform the same number of swaps regardless of the initial order since it always picks the smallest element from the unsorted part.\n\n- So, in terms of data movements, insertion sort might perform more shifts in this case, making selection sort potentially more efficient.\n\n- Wait, but the statement says \"more efficient.\" Efficiency can be measured in terms of time or space. If we consider time complexity, insertion sort in this case would have O(n^2) time complexity, and selection sort also has O(n^2) time complexity. But the number of comparisons and swaps might differ.\n\n- Actually, both have O(n^2) time complexity in the worst case, but insertion sort might perform fewer operations in practice for certain data distributions.\n\n- I need to think carefully. Maybe this isn't necessarily true.\n\n**Option B: The number of comparisons for selection sort is independent of the initial arrangement of elements.**\n\n- Selection sort always performs the same number of comparisons regardless of the initial order of the array.\n\n- It makes n-1 comparisons in the first iteration, n-2 in the second, and so on, down to 1 comparison in the last iteration.\n\n- So, total comparisons are (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 = n(n-1)/2, which is the same regardless of how the elements are arranged.\n\n- Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n**Option C: The number of comparisons for insertion sort is independent of the initial arrangement of elements.**\n\n- Insertion sort's number of comparisons depends heavily on the initial arrangement.\n\n- If the array is already sorted, insertion sort will make the fewest comparisons.\n\n- If the array is sorted in reverse order, it will make the most comparisons.\n\n- Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**Option D: The number of data movements in selection sort depends on the initial arrangement of elements.**\n\n- Selection sort always performs the same number of swaps, typically n-1 swaps, regardless of the initial order.\n\n- Each pass selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first unsorted element.\n\n- So, the number of data movements (swaps) is constant and does not depend on the initial arrangement.\n\n- Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nGiven this analysis, the only true statement is Option B: The number of comparisons for selection sort is independent of the initial arrangement of elements.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
