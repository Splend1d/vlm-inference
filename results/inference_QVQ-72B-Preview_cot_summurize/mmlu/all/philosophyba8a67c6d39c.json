                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand Plato's view on knowledge here. He thinks that real knowledge comes from seeing beyond the physical world to these abstract things called Forms or Essences. Like, when we see different triangles in the world, but the idea of triangularity itself is something perfect and unchanging, and that's what we should be focusing on to truly understand what a triangle is.\n\nSo, according to Plato, knowledge isn't just about recognizing shapes or objects in the world; it's about grasping these ideal forms that make those objects what they are. And he says that all knowledge is innate, meaning it's something we're born with, not something we learn from experience.\n\nNow, I need to choose which option best explains why Plato concludes that knowledge is innate. Let's look at each option:\n\nOption A says: From the moment we are born, we know what things are in the world in terms of ideas that we get through our senses.\n\nBut wait, Plato believed that our senses are unreliable and that the physical world is just a shadow of the real world of Forms. So, if knowledge comes from understanding these perfect Forms, it doesn't come from our senses. In fact, he thought that true knowledge is beyond sensory experience.\n\nOption B says: Since we are born with senses (that is, our senses are innate), we can know things about the sensible world with certainty as long as we rely on the senses alone.\n\nBut Plato argued that senses can deceive us. For example, sometimes things look bigger or smaller depending on the lighting or perspective. So, he wouldn't think that we can have certain knowledge just by relying on our senses.\n\nOption C says: Our knowledge of the world is not really of the sensible world itself but of the world grasped mathematically and ideally.\n\nThis sounds closer to Plato's idea. He did emphasize the importance of mathematics and abstract thinking. But the question is about innate knowledge, not about how we grasp the world mathematically.\n\nOption D says: Since our absolutely certain knowledge of things cannot be based on the changing things in sensible experience, it must merely be triggered by sensible experience.\n\nThis seems to align more closely with Plato's view. He thought that our knowledge of Forms is innate, and that experiencing particular instances in the sensible world triggers the recollection of these Forms.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. Plato's theory of knowledge is often associated with the idea of recollection. He believed that before we are born, our souls exist in the realm of Forms and have direct knowledge of them. Then, when we are born into the physical world, we forget this knowledge. But when we see particular instances of things, like beautiful objects or just shapes, these can act as reminders or triggers that help us recall the perfect Forms.\n\nSo, in this view, the knowledge of Forms is already within us, innate, and sensory experiences help us recall or remember it.\n\nLooking back at the options, Option D seems to capture this idea. It says that certain knowledge isn't based on the changing sensible world but is instead triggered by sensible experience.\n\nOption C talks about grasping the world mathematically and ideally, which is related to Plato's thought, but it doesn't directly address the innateness of knowledge or how sensible experience triggers the recollection of Forms.\n\nOption A suggests that we know things from birth based on sensory ideas, which contradicts Plato's view that sensory knowledge is imperfect and that true knowledge is beyond the senses.\n\nOption B claims that because senses are innate, we can have certain knowledge through them, which again goes against Plato's emphasis on the unreliability of senses for certain knowledge.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate choice is Option D: since our absolutely certain knowledge of things cannot be based on the changing things in sensible experience, it must merely be triggered by sensible experience.\n\nThis reflects Plato's belief that knowledge of Forms is innate and that sensible experiences prompt us to recall this innate knowledge.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
