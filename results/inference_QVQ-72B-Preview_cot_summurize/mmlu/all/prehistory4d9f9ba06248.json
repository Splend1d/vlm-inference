I don't know much about Aztec history, but I'll try to think through each option.\n\nOption A says that they were ruled by an iron fist by the king, who had armies stationed there. Hmm, the Aztecs were known for their powerful empire, so it's possible that the king had a lot of control over the villages. But I'm not sure if they had armies stationed in every village. That seems a bit extreme.\n\nOption B says that they were forced to send half of all maize they grew to the king as tribute and lived in absolute poverty. I know that the Aztecs had a tribute system, but I don't remember if it was as high as half of their crops. Also, absolute poverty sounds pretty harsh. Maybe some people were poor, but probably not everyone was living in absolute poverty.\n\nOption C says that they were mostly left alone and did fairly well for themselves. This seems more plausible. Maybe the Aztec empire allowed the villages some autonomy as long as they paid their tributes. If that's the case, then perhaps the commoners could manage their own affairs and live decently.\n\nOption D says that they had no protection from city-states that invaded from the north. Well, the Aztec empire was known for its military might, so it's unlikely that they wouldn't protect their own villages from invaders. Plus, the Aztecs controlled a large territory, so I doubt they would let other city-states invade their villages without resistance.\n\nBetween these options, C seems the most reasonable. It doesn't sound like the king was oppressive with armies in every village, and it's unlikely that the villagers were in constant fear of invasion without any protection. Also, while there might have been high tributes, I doubt it was half of all their maize, and that they were all living in absolute poverty.\n\nI think the answer is C: they were mostly left alone and did fairly well for themselves.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
