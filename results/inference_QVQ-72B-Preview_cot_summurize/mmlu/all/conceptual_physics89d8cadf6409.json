                    "text": "So I have this question about nuclear chemistry. It says that when a nucleus of uranium-238 emits an alpha particle, what's left behind? The options are thorium-242, thorium-238, thorium-234, or radium-214.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what happens when a nucleus emits an alpha particle. Alpha emission is a type of radioactive decay where an atomic nucleus releases an alpha particle. An alpha particle is basically a helium-4 nucleus, which means it has two protons and two neutrons.\n\nSo, when a uranium-238 nucleus emits an alpha particle, it's losing two protons and two neutrons. Uranium-238 has an atomic number of 92, which means it has 92 protons. After emitting an alpha particle (which carries away two protons), the new nucleus should have 92 - 2 = 90 protons.\n\nThe mass number of uranium-238 is 238, which includes both protons and neutrons. Since the alpha particle takes away two protons and two neutrons, the mass number decreases by 4. So, the new nucleus should have a mass number of 238 - 4 = 234.\n\nNow, I need to find out which element has an atomic number of 90. I remember that the periodic table is arranged in order of atomic numbers. Let's see:\n\n- Uranium is 92.\n\n- Below uranium, thorium is 90.\n\n- Then protactinium is 91.\n\nWait, no, protactinium is actually after uranium but before thorium. Let's recall the sequence:\n\n- Uranium (U) - 92\n\n- Thorium (Th) - 90\n\n- Protactinium (Pa) - 91\n\n- Neptunium (Np) - 93\n\n- Plutonium (Pu) - 94\n\nSo, thorium is 90, uranium is 92, and protactinium is 91.\n\nTherefore, after uranium-238 emits an alpha particle, the new nucleus should have an atomic number of 90, which is thorium, and a mass number of 234.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. thorium-242\n\nB. thorium-238\n\nC. thorium-234\n\nD. radium-214\n\nThe correct answer should be thorium-234, which is option C.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the process again:\n\n- Uranium-238 emits an alpha particle.\n\n- Alpha particle: 2 protons + 2 neutrons.\n\n- New nucleus: protons = 92 - 2 = 90 (thorium), mass number = 238 - 4 = 234.\n\nYes, that matches option C.\n\nI should also consider if there's any possibility of another answer being correct. For example, could the decay lead to radium-214 directly? No, that doesn't make sense because radium has an atomic number of 88, which would require losing four protons, but alpha emission only loses two protons at a time. So, radium-214 is not the immediate product of alpha emission from uranium-238.\n\nAdditionally, option A is thorium-242, which has a higher mass number than uranium-238, which doesn't make sense because emitting an alpha particle should decrease the mass number by 4.\n\nOption B is thorium-238, which has the correct atomic number but the wrong mass number. If uranium-238 emits an alpha particle, it should be thorium-234, not thorium-238.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is indeed option C, thorium-234.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can recall the general equation for alpha decay:\n\n\\[^A_ZX \\rightarrow ^{A-4}_{Z-2}Y + ^4_2\\alpha\\]\\[where\\ \\alpha\\ is\\ the\\ alpha\\ particle.\\]\n\nApplying this to uranium-238:\n\n\\[^{238}_{92}U \\rightarrow ^{234}_{90}Th + ^4_2\\alpha\\]\n\nThis confirms my earlier conclusion.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is thorium-234.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. thorium-234}} \\]"
