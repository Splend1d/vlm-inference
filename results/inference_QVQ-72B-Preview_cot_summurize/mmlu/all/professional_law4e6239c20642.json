                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out when the statutory period for adverse possession starts for the tenant. Let me try to understand all the details first.\n\nIn 1985, a widow leases her cottage to a tenant for seven years. So, the lease term is from 1985 to 1992, right? Rent is supposed to be paid monthly, on the first day of each month.\n\nThen, in 1986, the widow dies. She leaves her entire estate to the Boy Scouts of America in her will. But the will doesn't specifically mention the cottage. So, the cottage is part of her estate that goes to the Boy Scouts.\n\nOne month after she dies, in 1986, the tenant learns about her death and decides to stay on the property but stops paying rent. So, from that point on, the tenant is occupying the property without paying rent.\n\nThe Boy Scouts don't know about this gift until 2009, when their attorneys find out about it during an inventory of testamentary gifts. So, from 1986 to 2009, the Boy Scouts weren't aware that they owned the cottage.\n\nNow, the statutory period for adverse possession in this place is 20 years. I need to figure out when that 20-year period starts running for the tenant.\n\nLet me think about adverse possession. Adverse possession is when someone who doesn't have title to a property occupies it continuously and openly for a certain period, and at the end of that period, they can claim ownership of the property.\n\nThe general rules are that the possession must be:\n\n- Actual: the person is physically on the property.\n\n- Open and notorious: it's obvious to others that someone is occupying the property.\n\n- Exclusive: the person is treating the property as their own, without sharing it with others.\n\n- Hostile: the person is occupying the property without the permission of the true owner.\n\n- Continuous: the occupation is uninterrupted for the entire statutory period.\n\nIn this case, the tenant starts occupying the property with a lease, which is with permission from the owner, the widow. But after she dies in 1986, and the tenant stops paying rent, that's when things change.\n\nThe question is, when does the adverse possession period start?\n\nOption A says it starts when the widow died.\n\nOption B says it starts when the tenant discontinued paying rent.\n\nOption C says it starts when the tenant's lease with the widow expired.\n\nOption D says it starts when the tenant subjectively believed he no longer had permission to possess the cottage.\n\nLet me consider each option.\n\nOption A: when the widow died.\n\nWhen the widow died in 1986, her estate passed to the Boy Scouts via her will. So, the Boy Scouts became the new owners of the property, including the cottage.\n\nThe tenant, having learned of her death, decides to stay but stops paying rent. So, he's no longer recognizing the lease agreement.\n\nBut, did his adverse possession start immediately upon her death?\n\nWell, adverse possession typically requires that the possessor is acting in a way that is hostile to the owner's interests. By stopping rent payments, he's not fulfilling his obligations under the lease, which was his permission to occupy the property.\n\nSo, perhaps his adverse possession started when he stopped paying rent, which is option B.\n\nOption B: when the tenant discontinued paying rent.\n\nThis seems plausible. By stopping rent payments, he's no longer recognizing the lease agreement and is effectively occupying the property without permission from the new owner, the Boy Scouts.\n\nBut, wait. The Boy Scouts didn't know about the property until 2009. Does that matter?\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the adverse possession period starts when the true owner would have first had knowledge of the possession, or when the possessor's actions are such that the owner could have discovered them.\n\nBut generally, adverse possession periods run against the true owner, whether or not the owner knows about it.\n\nSo, even if the Boy Scouts didn't know about it, the period could still be running.\n\nOption C: when the tenant's lease with the widow expired.\n\nThe lease was for seven years, starting in 1985, so it would expire in 1992.\n\nIf the tenant stayed beyond 1992 without a new lease, then his possession would be adverse from that point onward.\n\nBut in this scenario, he stopped paying rent in 1986, after the widow's death, but before the lease expired in 1992.\n\nSo, from 1986 to 1992, he's occupying the property without paying rent, which could be considered adverse possession.\n\nAfter 1992, when the lease expires, his possession is clearly adverse because he has no lease or other permission to stay.\n\nSo, does the adverse possession period start in 1986 when he stopped paying rent, or in 1992 when the lease expired?\n\nI think it starts in 1986. Because he's already occupying without permission (not paying rent) before the lease expires.\n\nOption D: when the tenant subjectively believed he no longer had permission to possess the cottage.\n\nThis seems a bit tricky. Adverse possession requires that the possessor acts in a way that is hostile to the owner's interests, but the possessor's subjective belief isn't always relevant.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the possessor must have a subjective belief that they are owning the property, perhaps in good faith or bad faith, which can affect the adverse possession period.\n\nBut in this case, the tenant knows the widow died, and he decides to stay and stop paying rent. So, he probably believes he doesn't have to pay rent anymore, perhaps thinking that since there's no heir and no one knows about it, he can just stay.\n\nBut his subjective belief about whether he has permission might not matter for the start of the adverse possession period.\n\nI think the key point is when he stops paying rent and continues to occupy without permission, which is in 1986.\n\nSo, option B seems the most straightforward answer.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the lease was until 1992, and he stopped paying rent in 1986, is his occupation adverse from 1986 onward, or does he have some rights under the lease until it expires?\n\nWell, under the lease, he was supposed to pay rent monthly. By stopping rent payments, he's breaching the lease agreement.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, if a tenant stops paying rent, the landlord can consider the lease terminated and evict the tenant.\n\nSo, by stopping rent payments, the tenant is essentially repudiating the lease agreement, and the landlord (now the Boy Scouts) could treat the lease as terminated and seek to evict the tenant.\n\nTherefore, from the point when he stopped paying rent, his possession is without permission from the landlord, and thus adverse possession could start.\n\nSo, the statutory period would start in 1986 when he stopped paying rent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. the tenant discontinued paying rent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
