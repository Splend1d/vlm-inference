                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to add 4 over 7 and 2 over 7. Hmm, fractions can be tricky, but I think I remember how to do this.\n\nSo, the problem is to find 4/7 + 2/7. First off, I notice that both fractions have the same denominator, which is 7. I think that makes things easier because I don't have to find a common denominator.\n\nI recall that when the denominators are the same, I can just add the numerators and keep the denominator as it is. So, 4 + 2 is 6, and the denominator stays 7. That would make the answer 6/7.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should consider if there's any simplifying needed. But 6 and 7 don't have any common factors other than 1, so 6/7 is already in its simplest form.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should think about it another way. Perhaps converting the fractions to decimals or something, but that seems unnecessary for such simple fractions.\n\nLet me see what the options are. Oh, right, there are multiple choices provided:\n\nA. 6 over 14\n\nB. 8 over 49\n\nC. 14 over 28\n\nD. 6 over 7\n\nHmm, so among these, which one matches my answer?\n\nLooking at option D, it's 6 over 7, which is exactly what I got. But let me make sure the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A is 6 over 14. Well, that's equivalent to 3/7, which is not equal to 4/7 + 2/7.\n\nOption B is 8 over 49. That simplifies to 8/49, which is roughly 0.163, and 4/7 + 2/7 is 6/7, which is about 0.857, so definitely not the same.\n\nOption C is 14 over 28, which simplifies to 1/2. Again, not equal to 6/7.\n\nSo, clearly, option D is the correct one.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider if the question is trying to trick me in some way. Perhaps there's a different method to add fractions with the same denominator that I should be aware of.\n\nLet me think about the properties of fractions. When adding fractions with the same denominator, the sum is indeed the sum of the numerators over the common denominator. So, 4/7 + 2/7 = (4 + 2)/7 = 6/7.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the concept of equivalent fractions. But in this case, since the denominators are already the same, there's no need to find equivalent fractions.\n\nMaybe I should think about it in terms of units. If 1/7 is one unit, then 4/7 is four units and 2/7 is two units. Adding them gives six units, which is 6/7.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert them to decimals to verify. 4 divided by 7 is approximately 0.571, and 2 divided by 7 is approximately 0.286. Adding those gives about 0.857, which is the same as 6/7.\n\nBut honestly, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The straightforward way is just to add the numerators since the denominators are the same, and that gives me 6/7 directly.\n\nI should also consider if the question might have a typo or if there's a different interpretation needed, but assuming it's a standard addition of fractions, my conclusion stands.\n\nSo, my final answer is D. 6 over 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D}\\ ]"
