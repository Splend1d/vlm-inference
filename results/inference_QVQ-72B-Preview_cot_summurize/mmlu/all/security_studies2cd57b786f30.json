                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question about the implications of recent technological change and development from the perspective of peace studies. There are four options here, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nOption A says that technological developments don't affect most of the world's population, and that advancements in telecommunications and digital media aren't a concern for peace studies. Hmm, that seems a bit odd. With the way information spreads these days, I would think that these developments have a significant impact on people everywhere, not just a select few. Plus, peace studies typically look at how technology can influence conflicts and cooperation between countries. So, this option seems unlikely.\n\nMoving on to Option B: it suggests that digital information, media, and communications technology will inspire greater harmony in the international system as people learn more about the world and each other. This sounds like the optimistic view, where increased connectivity leads to better understanding and peace. There is some truth to this; for example, social media can connect people across borders and cultures, fostering empathy and mutual respect. However, I recall that peace studies also consider the potential downsides of technology, so maybe this is too simplistic.\n\nOption C presents a different perspective: it says that access to digital information will make disempowered populations aware of their own exclusion and global inequalities, potentially leading to frustration and revolution. This seems plausible. History shows that when people realize the disparities between their situation and that of others, it can fuel dissent and demands for change. This could be both positive, in terms of striving for equality, or negative, if it leads to violence and conflict. Peace studies would likely consider this a significant implication of technological change.\n\nLastly, Option D states that technological change and development will strengthen the power of already dominant international players and reinforce the status quo. This implies that new technologies benefit those who are already powerful, whether economically or politically, and may not necessarily lead to fundamental changes in the international order. This could be seen as maintaining existing power structures, which might prevent major shifts in relations that could cause instability or conflict.\n\nSo, now I need to decide which of these options best represents the implications of recent technological change according to peace studies. I think Option C is particularly relevant because it highlights a specific way that technology can exacerbate tensions by revealing inequalities, which could lead to social unrest and potentially affect international peace.\n\nBut let me double-check. Peace studies often examine how technology can be a double-edged sword\u2014bringing people closer but also highlighting differences and inequalities. So, while Option B suggests a harmonious outcome, Option C acknowledges the potential for conflict arising from increased awareness of disparities.\n\nOption D, on the other hand, suggests that technological advancement maintains the status quo, which might contribute to stability, but it doesn't directly address the implications for peace in terms of equity and justice.\n\nGiven this, I believe Option C is the most accurate answer because it directly addresses how technological change can lead to awareness of inequalities, which in turn can cause frustration and potentially revolution, issues that peace studies would closely examine.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
