                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about z-scores and normal distributions. It says that the observed times (in minutes) it takes a runner to complete a marathon are normally distributed, and this week his z-score is -2. I need to choose the correct interpretation of this z-score from the given options.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a z-score is. A z-score measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. The formula for z-score is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(x - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( z \\) is the z-score,\n\n- \\( x \\) is the data point (in this case, the runner's time this week),\n\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean of the distribution (the average time),\n\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation of the distribution.\n\nGiven that the z-score is -2, that means:\n\n\\[ -2 = \\frac{(x - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nWhich implies:\n\n\\[ x - \\mu = -2\\sigma \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ x = \\mu - 2\\sigma \\]\n\nThis tells me that this week's running time is two standard deviations below the mean.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. This week his time was two minutes lower than his time last week.\n\nThis doesn't make sense because it compares this week's time to last week's time, but we don't have information about last week's time. The z-score compares this week's time to the mean time, not to a specific past time.\n\nB. This week his time was two minutes lower than his best time ever.\n\nThis seems to suggest a comparison to his best time, but the z-score is about deviation from the mean, not from the best time. Also, without knowing what his best time is, we can't make this conclusion.\n\nC. This week his time was two minutes lower than his average time.\n\nHmm, this seems close but not exactly accurate. The z-score indicates that his time is two standard deviations below the mean, not necessarily two minutes below the mean. The standard deviation is in minutes, but its actual value isn't specified, so we can't assume it's two minutes.\n\nD. This week his time was two standard deviations lower than his average time.\n\nThis matches exactly with what the z-score represents. A z-score of -2 means the data point is two standard deviations below the mean.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option D seems to be the correct interpretation.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any possibility that the standard deviation could be one minute, making two standard deviations two minutes, which might relate to option C?\n\nWell, if the standard deviation is one minute, then two standard deviations would be two minutes, but without knowing the actual value of the standard deviation, we can't assume it's one minute. So, option C is not necessarily correct because it specifies two minutes, whereas the z-score refers to two standard deviations, which could be any value depending on the data.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate interpretation is option D: this week his time was two standard deviations lower than his average time.\n\nI think that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
