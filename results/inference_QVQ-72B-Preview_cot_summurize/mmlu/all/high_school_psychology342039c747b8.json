The question is: \"Get cookie\" best exemplifies...\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. babbling\n\nB. cooing\n\nC. holophrases\n\nD. telegraphic speech\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to understand what each of these terms means in the context of language development.\n\nStarting with babbling: I remember that babbling is one of the early stages of language development in infants. It's when they make repetitive sounds like \"da-da-da\" or \"ba-ba-ba.\" But in this case, \"get cookie\" seems more structured than babbling. It's a phrase with a clear intention, right? So, probably not babbling.\n\nNext, cooing. I think cooing is the pleasant, soft sounds that babies make, often in response to affection or when they're happy. It's more about vocal play and less about forming words or phrases. \"Get cookie\" seems more purposeful than cooing, so maybe not B.\n\nNow, holophrases. I'm not as familiar with this term, but I think it refers to single words that represent a whole idea or phrase. For example, a toddler might say \"cookie\" when they mean \"I want a cookie.\" So, \"get cookie\" is a bit different because it's actually two words, not just one. Maybe holophrases are single words, not phrases.\n\nLastly, telegraphic speech. I've heard of this; it's when children use short, simple sentences, omitting unnecessary words, kind of like telegrams. For example, \"want cookie\" instead of \"I want a cookie.\" \"Get cookie\" seems similar to that.\n\nWait a minute, \"get cookie\" is a two-word phrase, which could be considered a simple sentence. In telegraphic speech, children might say things like \"get ball\" or \"go outside,\" omitting words like \"I\" or \"let's.\" So, maybe D is the answer.\n\nBut, let me double-check. Holophrases are single words that stand for whole ideas, like \"cookie\" meaning \"I want a cookie.\" So, that's different from \"get cookie,\" which is two words.\n\nTelegraphic speech involves using short, simplified sentences that omit unnecessary words. \"Get cookie\" could be seen as a simplified version of \"I want to get a cookie\" or something similar. So, it fits with telegraphic speech.\n\nBabbling and cooing are earlier stages of language development, where children are experimenting with sounds but not yet forming words or phrases with meaning. Since \"get cookie\" is a meaningful phrase, it's beyond the babbling and cooing stages.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D. telegraphic speech.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if \"get cookie\" could possibly fit into any other category. Holophrases are single words, so definitely not that. Babbling is non-meaningful repetition of sounds, not a phrase. Cooing is more about the tone and expression of sounds, not about conveying specific meanings.\n\nSo, yeah, I think D. telegraphic speech is the correct answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
