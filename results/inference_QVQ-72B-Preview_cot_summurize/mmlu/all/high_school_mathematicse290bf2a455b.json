                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find the domain of the function \\(f(x) = \\frac{x + 6}{\\sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4}}\\). The domain of a function consists of all the input values (x-values) for which the function is defined and produces a real output value.\n\nFirst, I should look at the denominator because dividing by zero is undefined. So, the expression under the square root, \\(x^2 - 3x - 4\\), cannot be zero or negative because the square root of a negative number isn't a real number. Therefore, the denominator \\(\\sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4}\\) is only defined when \\(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\\).\n\nMy first task is to solve the inequality \\(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\\). To do this, I'll start by finding the roots of the equation \\(x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0\\). Using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\]\n\nHere, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -3\\), and \\(c = -4\\). Plugging these values in:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{-(-3) \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(1)(-4)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 16}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{25}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm 5}{2}\\]\n\nSo, the roots are:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{3 + 5}{2} = 4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{3 - 5}{2} = -1\\]\n\nNow, the quadratic expression \\(x^2 - 3x - 4\\) is a parabola that opens upwards because the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is positive. So, it will be greater than zero outside the interval between its roots.\n\nTherefore, \\(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\\) when \\(x < -1\\) or \\(x > 4\\).\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that the entire denominator isn't zero or negative. Since the square root function is only defined for non-negative numbers, and we've ensured that \\(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\\), which means the expression under the square root is positive, the denominator is indeed defined and non-zero for \\(x < -1\\) or \\(x > 4\\).\n\nLet me double-check if there are any other restrictions. The numerator is \\(x + 6\\), which is defined for all real numbers since it's just a linear function. So, there are no additional restrictions from the numerator.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. (-4,4)\n\nB. [0,4]\n\nC. (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)\n\nD. (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)\n\nOption C seems to match what I've determined: all x less than -1 or all x greater than 4.\n\nBut let's consider if there are any values within these intervals that might not be in the domain. For example, is there any value in \\(x < -1\\) or \\(x > 4\\) that would make the denominator zero?\n\nFrom the quadratic equation, the roots are at \\(x = -1\\) and \\(x = 4\\), which are the points where the expression under the square root is zero. So, as long as we exclude these points, the function is defined.\n\nTherefore, the domain of \\(f(x)\\) is indeed all real numbers less than -1 or greater than 4, which is expressed in interval notation as \\((-\\infty, -1) \\cup (4, \\infty)\\).\n\nWait a minute, option D seems to include some extra parts: \\((-\u221e, -1) \\cup (-1, 4) \\cup (4, \u221e)\\). But that doesn't make sense because between -1 and 4, the expression under the square root is negative, which would make the square root undefined. So, option D is incorrect.\n\nOption A suggests (-4,4), but this can't be right because for \\(x\\) between -1 and 4, the expression under the square root is negative, which isn't allowed. Also, it doesn't account for \\(x > 4\\).\n\nOption B is [0,4], which also doesn't cover \\(x > 4\\), and within [0,4], the expression under the square root is negative for \\(x\\) between -1 and 4, except at the roots.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C: (-inf, -1) U (4, inf).\n\nJust to be thorough, let's pick a few test points.\n\nFirst, let's take \\(x = -2\\), which is less than -1.\n\nCalculate \\(x^2 - 3x - 4 = (-2)^2 - 3(-2) - 4 = 4 + 6 - 4 = 6 > 0\\). So, the function is defined here.\n\nNext, \\(x = 5\\), which is greater than 4.\n\n\\(5^2 - 3(5) - 4 = 25 - 15 - 4 = 6 > 0\\). Again, defined.\n\nNow, let's take \\(x = 0\\), which is between -1 and 4.\n\n\\(0^2 - 3(0) - 4 = -4 < 0\\). The square root of a negative number is not real, so the function is undefined here.\n\nSimilarly, \\(x = -1\\) and \\(x = 4\\) are the roots where the denominator is zero, so they must be excluded.\n\nTherefore, the domain is correctly given by option C: (-inf, -1) U (4, inf).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
