                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about DNA. It's asking about the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded DNA molecule. The options are:\n\nA. Variable.\n\nB. Determined by the base sequence in RNA.\n\nC. Genetically determined.\n\nD. Always 1:1.\n\nHmm. First, I need to recall what purines and pyrimidines are in DNA. Purines are the larger nitrogenous bases: adenine (A) and guanine (G). Pyrimidines are the smaller ones: thymine (T) and cytosine (C).\n\nSo, in DNA, we have A, G, T, and C paired up in a specific way: A pairs with T, and G pairs with C. This is called complementary base pairing.\n\nNow, the question is about the ratio of purines to pyrimidines. Purines are A and G, and pyrimidines are T and C.\n\nIn a double-stranded DNA molecule, for every A that pairs with a T, there's one A and one T, which is one purine and one pyrimidine. Similarly, for every G that pairs with a C, there's one G and one C, which is again one purine and one pyrimidine.\n\nSo, no matter how many base pairs there are, for every purine on one strand, there's a pyrimidine on the other strand, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines should always be 1:1 in a double-stranded DNA molecule.\n\nLet me double-check this. If I have a DNA molecule with 100 base pairs, each pair consists of one purine and one pyrimidine. So, total purines would be 100, and total pyrimidines would be 100, making the ratio 1:1.\n\nWhat if the DNA has more G and C pairs than A and T pairs? Would that change anything?\n\nWell, in both cases, whether it's A-T or G-C, each pair consists of one purine and one pyrimidine. So, regardless of the base composition, the ratio remains 1:1.\n\nWait a minute. Is there any exception to this? I think not, because the double-stranded nature of DNA requires that purines always pair with pyrimidines, and vice versa.\n\nLet me consider the charge or size, but that probably doesn't affect the ratio directly.\n\nOption A says variable. That doesn't seem right because the ratio is always 1:1.\n\nOption B says determined by the base sequence in RNA. Hmm, but the question is about DNA, not RNA. And the base sequence in RNA wouldn't directly determine the purine:pyrimidine ratio in DNA.\n\nOption C says genetically determined. Well, genetically, the base composition can vary between species, but the ratio of purines to pyrimidines remains 1:1 in double-stranded DNA because of the pairing rules.\n\nOption D says always 1:1. That matches my understanding.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about single-stranded DNA or RNA. In single-stranded DNA, the ratio could be different because there's no complementary pairing to enforce a 1:1 ratio. However, the question specifies a double-stranded molecule of DNA.\n\nIn RNA, which is usually single-stranded, the base composition can vary, and the ratio of purines to pyrimidines isn't fixed, but again, the question is about DNA.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the correct answer is D. Always 1:1.\n\nI don't think it's A, variable, because the pairing rules enforce a 1:1 ratio.\n\nOption B seems irrelevant because the base sequence in RNA shouldn't directly determine the purine:pyrimidine ratio in DNA.\n\nOption C, genetically determined, might be true in the sense that different organisms have different GC or AT contents, but the ratio of purines to pyrimidines remains 1:1 in double-stranded DNA.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D. Always 1:1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
