                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about group dynamics. It asks for the term that describes a set of behaviors and tasks that a group member is expected to perform solely because they're part of that group. The options are group roles, virtual teamwork, synergy, and role making. Hmm, let's see which one fits best.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what each term means in the context of group work.\n\nStarting with \"group roles\": That sounds like different positions or functions that people take on within a group. Like, some people might be leaders, others might handle communications, or maybe someone is the note-taker. These roles help organize the group's work and ensure that everyone knows what they're responsible for. This seems pretty close to the definition in the question.\n\n\"Virtual teamwork\" makes me think of teams that work remotely, maybe using technology to collaborate over long distances. While this is relevant in today's world, it doesn't directly address the set of expected behaviors and tasks based on group membership. So, maybe not the right choice here.\n\n\"Synergy\" is another option. I remember learning about synergy in groups where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. That is, when people work together, they can achieve more than if they worked alone. While this is an important concept in group dynamics, it doesn't directly describe the expected behaviors or tasks assigned to group members based on their roles.\n\nLastly, \"role making\" sounds interesting. It seems like it might involve creating or defining one's own role within a group, perhaps through negotiation or natural emergence over time. While this is related to roles, it's more about the process of forming roles rather than the expectations themselves.\n\nGiven these considerations, \"group roles\" seems to be the most appropriate answer. It directly refers to the set of behaviors and tasks that group members are expected to perform based on their positions within the group.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about it differently. Maybe there's a better way to understand this.\n\nImagine you're in a project team at work. There's a project manager who oversees everything, a designer who creates the visual elements, a writer who produces the content, and a researcher who gathers data. Each person has specific responsibilities that are expected of them because of their role in the team. So, in this case, their \"group roles\" define what they're supposed to do.\n\nVirtual teamwork might involve how they collaborate remotely, synergy could be about how their combined efforts produce better results, and role making might be about how these roles were established or adjusted over time.\n\nBut again, the question is specifically about the set of behaviors and tasks expected of a group member due to their group membership. That points straight to group roles.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check a dictionary or textbook definition of group roles.\n\nOkay, found this: \"Group roles refer to the expected behavior associated with a particular position within a group. These roles help in defining the responsibilities and duties of each member, contributing to the group's overall functioning and goal achievement.\"\n\nThat matches perfectly with the description in the question. So, it's clear that \"group roles\" is the correct term here.\n\nI should also consider if there's any chance that \"role making\" could be interpreted as the same thing. But no, role making seems more about the process of defining or creating roles, whereas group roles are the actual positions and their associated expectations.\n\nSynergy is more about the beneficial outcome of group work, not about individual expectations.\n\nVirtual teamwork is about the mode of collaboration, not about role expectations.\n\nTherefore, without a doubt, the correct answer is A. Group roles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Group roles}} \\]"
