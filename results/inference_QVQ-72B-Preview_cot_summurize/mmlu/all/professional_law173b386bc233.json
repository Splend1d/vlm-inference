                    "text": "Co-defendants were dealers at a casino. They had been employed by the casino for four years. One day, they were unexpectedly fired by the casino's new manager. Apparently, the casino hired the new manager to get rid of some of the old-time employees and replace them with new personnel at a lower wage. Angered by their firing, the codefendants vowed to get back at the casino. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the casino and demand $1,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the casino should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, one of the co-defendants, who was an electronics expert, built the bomb himself. He alone then drove to the casino where he placed the bomb in a hallway closet. Shortly thereafter, the other co-defendant phoned the casino and made a demand for the money. He said a bomb was in the casino and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The casino treated their demand as a crank call and refused to make any payment. With their plans having gone awry, the codefendants agreed that one of them should return to the casino and defuse the bomb. As one of the co-defendants was driving back to the casino, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. A subsequent investigation revealed that a faulty wire caused the bomb to detonate prematurely. A state statute provides that detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb or explosive device in or near a building or dwelling is a felony. If the co-defendants are charged with violating the aforementioned statute, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. Both are guilty, because each participated in the planning of the crime.\nB. The co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, because he built and transported the bomb, but the other co-defendant is not guilty, because his phone call was not a substantial step in the furtherance of the crime.\nC. Neither is guilty, because the casino's gross negligence in failing to heed the telephone warning constituted an independent intervening cause of the explosion.\nD. Neither is guilty, because they did not intend for anyone to be killed, but the bomb exploded prematurely.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about two co-defendants who were fired from their jobs at a casino and decided to get revenge by planting a bomb and demanding a ransom. Let's see, they were dealers at the casino for four years and then fired by the new manager who wanted to replace them with lower-paid staff. They got angry and decided to plant a bomb and demand a million dollars. They planned to tell the casino where the bomb was and how to defuse it after getting the money so that no one would get hurt.\n\nOne of them, who was an electronics expert, built the bomb and placed it in a hallway closet at the casino. The other one called the casino to demand the money and warn them about the bomb, giving them 24 hours to pay up. But the casino didn't take the threat seriously and refused to pay. So, their plan went wrong, and they decided that one of them should go back and defuse the bomb. While he was on his way back, the bomb exploded prematurely due to a faulty wire, killing 30 people.\n\nNow, there's a state statute that says detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb or explosive device in or near a building or dwelling is a felony. The question is, if the co-defendants are charged with violating this statute, which statement is correct?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Both are guilty, because each participated in the planning of the crime.\n\nB. The co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, because he built and transported the bomb, but the other co-defendant is not guilty, because his phone call was not a substantial step in the furtherance of the crime.\n\nC. Neither is guilty, because the casino's gross negligence in failing to heed the telephone warning constituted an independent intervening cause of the explosion.\n\nD. Neither is guilty, because they did not intend for anyone to be killed, but the bomb exploded prematurely.\n\nHmm, I need to think through this carefully.\n\nFirst, let's consider the roles of each co-defendant.\n\nOne co-defendant built the bomb and placed it in the casino. That seems pretty straightforward\u2014he actively constructed and installed the device. The other co-defendant made the phone call demanding money and warning about the bomb. Even though he didn't physically handle the bomb, he was part of the plan and contributed to the commission of the crime.\n\nIn criminal law, when multiple people conspire or collaborate to commit a crime, they can both be held responsible for the entire crime, even if one did more than the other. This is called \"joint enterprise\" or \"common purpose.\" So, even if one person did most of the act, the other can still be guilty if they agreed to and participated in the plan.\n\nSo, option A suggests that both are guilty because they participated in the planning. That seems plausible.\n\nOption B says that only the one who built the bomb is guilty, and the other isn't because his phone call wasn't a substantial step in furthering the crime. But wait, the phone call was part of their plan to demand money and warn about the bomb. It was a crucial part of their scheme, so I don't think it's accurate to say it wasn't a substantial step. Without the phone call, the casino wouldn't have known about the bomb or the demand.\n\nOption C argues that neither is guilty because the casino's negligence in not heeding the warning was an independent intervening cause of the explosion. But, in criminal law, once you set in motion a chain of events that leads to a crime, you're responsible for the consequences, even if there are intervening factors. The casino's response might affect the sentencing or other aspects, but it probably doesn't exonerate the co-defendants completely.\n\nOption D says neither is guilty because they didn't intend for anyone to be killed, and the bomb exploded prematurely. But intent to kill isn't necessarily required for certain crimes, especially when dealing with explosives. The statute mentions detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb in or near a building, which is a felony. So, even if they didn't intend to kill, they intended to detonate a bomb in a building, which is against the law.\n\nMoreover, they planned to detonate the bomb after getting the money, so they did intend to detonate it eventually. The fact that it exploded prematurely due to a faulty wire is just an accident, but the act of placing the bomb with the intent to detonate it is already a crime.\n\nSo, based on this, I think option A is the correct answer: both are guilty because each participated in the planning of the crime.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn criminal law, there's the concept of \"accessory before the fact\" or \"aiding and abetting.\" If someone helps plan a crime or assists in its commission, they can be charged as an accessory, even if they don't physically commit the act themselves.\n\nIn this case, both co-defendants were involved in planning the crime: one built the bomb and placed it, and the other made the phone call to demand money and warn about the bomb. Both actions were necessary parts of their plan.\n\nAdditionally, there's the idea of \"conspiracy,\" where two or more people agree to commit a crime. If they take at least one overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, both can be charged with the crime, regardless of who did what.\n\nSo, even if one co-defendant only made the phone call, and the other built and placed the bomb, both are still guilty of the crime because they were working together towards the same objective.\n\nTherefore, I believe option A is the correct answer.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the phone call was indeed a substantial step in furthering the crime; it was part of their extortion plan.\n\nOption C is incorrect because, in most jurisdictions, the negligence of the victim or another party doesn't absolve the perpetrators of responsibility for the consequences of their actions.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the co-defendants intended to detonate the bomb; the premature explosion was an accident due to a faulty wire, but the intent to detonate was there.\n\nSo, final answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
