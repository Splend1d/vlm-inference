                    "text": "Let's see. There's this probability problem where two players take turns tossing a fair coin, and the first one to toss a head wins. I need to find the probability that the player who goes first wins the game. The options are 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, and 2/3.\n\nHmm, okay. First, I need to understand the setup. It's a fair coin, so the probability of getting a head (H) or a tail (T) is both 1/2. The players take turns tossing the coin, and the first one to get a head wins.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. Let's say Player A goes first, then Player B, and they keep taking turns until someone gets a head.\n\nSo, the possible scenarios are:\n\n1. Player A gets a head on their first toss. That's straightforward: probability of H is 1/2.\n\n2. Player A gets a tail on their first toss, then Player B gets a head on their first toss. The probability for this sequence is (1/2) for T from A and (1/2) for H from B, so together it's (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4.\n\n3. Both A and B get tails, then A gets a head on their second toss. That would be T, T, H for A's second turn. The probability is (1/2)^3 = 1/8.\n\n4. T, T, T, H for B's second turn. That's (1/2)^4 = 1/16.\n\nAnd this pattern continues indefinitely.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability that Player A wins. So, that includes all the scenarios where A gets a head on their first, second, third, etc., turns.\n\nLooking at the probabilities:\n\n- A wins on first turn: 1/2\n\n- A wins on second turn: 1/8\n\n- A wins on third turn: (1/2)^5 = 1/32\n\n- A wins on fourth turn: (1/2)^7 = 1/128\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the total probability that A wins is the sum of these probabilities:\n\nP(A) = 1/2 + 1/8 + 1/32 + 1/128 + ...\n\nThis looks like a geometric series where each term is (1/4)^n multiplied by some constant.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n1/2 = (1/2)^1\n\n1/8 = (1/2)^3\n\n1/32 = (1/2)^5\n\n1/128 = (1/2)^7\n\nSo, in general, the nth term where A wins on their nth turn is (1/2)^(2n - 1)\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nFor n=1: (1/2)^(2*1 - 1) = (1/2)^1 = 1/2 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (1/2)^3 = 1/8 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (1/2)^5 = 1/32 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the total probability is the sum from n=1 to \u221e of (1/2)^(2n - 1)\n\nLet's factor out (1/2):\n\nP(A) = (1/2) * sum from n=1 to \u221e of (1/2)^(2n - 2) = (1/2) * sum from n=1 to \u221e of (1/4)^(n - 1)\n\nWait, (1/2)^(2n - 1) = (1/2) * (1/4)^(n - 1)\n\nSo, P(A) = (1/2) * sum_{n=1}^\u221e (1/4)^(n - 1)\n\nNow, the sum of an infinite geometric series is S = a / (1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.\n\nHere, a = 1 (since (1/4)^0 = 1 when n=1), so sum from n=1 to \u221e of (1/4)^(n - 1) = sum from m=0 to \u221e of (1/4)^m = 1 / (1 - 1/4) = 4/3\n\nTherefore, P(A) = (1/2) * (4/3) = 2/3\n\nWait, but 2/3 is one of the options. Is that correct?\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way to think about it.\n\nLet\u2019s denote P(A) as the probability that Player A wins.\n\nSince the game must be won by either A or B, and the coin is fair, perhaps there's a symmetry here.\n\nBut wait, the players don't have equal chances because A goes first.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that at each turn, the probability of winning is the probability of getting a head, which is 1/2, assuming that the previous tosses were tails.\n\nBut that seems too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, think about the infinite series approach again.\n\nThe probability that A wins on their first turn is 1/2.\n\nThe probability that A wins on their second turn is (1/2)^3, because T, T, H.\n\nSimilarly, A wins on their third turn: (1/2)^5, and so on.\n\nSo, P(A) = 1/2 + (1/2)^3 + (1/2)^5 + ...\n\nThis is a geometric series with first term a = 1/2 and common ratio r = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nThe sum S of an infinite geometric series is S = a / (1 - r) = (1/2) / (1 - 1/4) = (1/2)/(3/4) = (1/2)*(4/3) = 2/3\n\nSo, P(A) = 2/3\n\nWait, but this seems high. Let's see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the probability that A wins is P(A) = probability A wins on their first turn OR their second turn OR their third turn, etc.\n\nWhich is P(A) = (1/2) + (1/2)^3 + (1/2)^5 + ...\n\nWhich, as calculated, sums to 2/3.\n\nAlternatively, think about the probability that B wins, which would be P(B) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3\n\nWhich makes sense, since B wins only if A misses on their first turn and then B hits, or A and B miss and then A misses again and B hits, and so on.\n\nWait, but in this case, P(B) = (1/2)*(1/2) + (1/2)^3*(1/2) + (1/2)^5*(1/2) + ... = (1/4) + (1/8)^2 + (1/16)^3 + ...\n\nWait, no. Wait, P(B) = (1/2)*(1/2) + (1/2)^3*(1/2) + (1/2)^5*(1/2) + ... = (1/4) + (1/8) + (1/16)^2 + ...\n\nWait, no, that's not correct.\n\nActually, P(B) = (1/2)*(1/2) + (1/2)^3*(1/2) + (1/2)^5*(1/2) + ... = (1/4) + (1/8) + (1/16)^2 + ...\n\nWait, no, that's not right.\n\nWait, actually, P(B) = (1/2)*(1/2) + (1/2)^3*(1/2) + (1/2)^5*(1/2) + ... = (1/4) + (1/8) + (1/16)^2 + ...\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate.\n\nWait, P(B) wins on their first turn: T, H which is (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4\n\nP(B) wins on their second turn: T, T, T, H which is (1/2)^4 = 1/16\n\nP(B) wins on their third turn: T, T, T, T, T, H which is (1/2)^6 = 1/64\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, P(B) = 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + ... = sum from n=1 to \u221e of (1/4)^n\n\nWhich is a geometric series with a = 1/4, r = 1/4, so S = (1/4)/(1 - 1/4) = (1/4)/(3/4) = 1/3\n\nWhich matches P(A) + P(B) = 2/3 + 1/3 = 1, which is good.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Player A wins is indeed 2/3.\n\nSo, the answer is D. 2/3\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{D}\\]"
