It's asking which of the following options is most characteristic of gesture drawing: an outline, action and movement, gradual shading, or carefully observed details. I need to choose one that best defines what gesture drawing is all about.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what gesture drawing is. From what I recall, gesture drawing is a technique used by artists to capture the essence of a subject's pose or movement quickly. It's usually done in a short amount of time, like a minute or two, to focus on the overall gesture without getting bogged down by details.\n\nSo, let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A: An outline. An outline seems more related to the external shape of an object or figure. While outlines can be part of gesture drawing, I don't think they're the primary focus. Gesture drawing is more about capturing the movement and feel of the subject rather than just its outline.\n\nOption B: Action and movement. This sounds very relevant to gesture drawing. The whole point is to capture the sense of motion or posture in a fleeting moment. Gesture drawing is often used to practice drawing figures in various poses, emphasizing movement over detailed accuracy.\n\nOption C: Gradual shading. Shading is a technique used to add depth and form to drawings, but in gesture drawing, which is typically fast-paced and focuses on the overall gesture, there might not be enough time for detailed shading. So, this seems less likely to be a characteristic of gesture drawing.\n\nOption D: Carefully observed details. This seems contrary to the nature of gesture drawing. Gesture drawing is about capturing the essence quickly, not dwelling on fine details. Careful observation and detailed rendering take more time, which isn't the goal here.\n\nPutting it all together, option B: action and movement seems to be the most characteristic of gesture drawing. It aligns perfectly with the purpose and method of this drawing technique.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check. Gesture drawing is all about capturing the gesture, which inherently involves the pose, movement, and sometimes the emotion of the subject. So, yes, action and movement are central to this practice.\n\nI don't think it's just about an outline because that's more about the shape, not necessarily the movement. Shading and details are important in other types of drawing but not specifically in gesture drawing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Action and movement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
