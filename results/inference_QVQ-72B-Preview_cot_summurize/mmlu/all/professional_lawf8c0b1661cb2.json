                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario about a screenwriter who sold a screenplay to a movie studio and then made a promise to give some of the proceeds to a friend. I need to figure out what kind of promise this is, based on the options given: equitable lien, conditional assignment, irrevocable assignment, or gratuitous assignment of future rights. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the initial agreement between the screenwriter and the movie studio. The studio bought the rights to the screenplay for $5,000 and also agreed to pay the screenwriter 10% of the gross receipts if the movie is made and distributed. So, the screenwriter is entitled to a percentage of the movie's earnings.\n\nNow, at a birthday party, the screenwriter realizes she forgot a gift and quickly writes a note promising her friend 5% of the proceeds she will receive from the distribution of the movie. She signs it and gives it to her friend. So, she's promising to give her friend a portion of the money she expects to get from the movie's distribution.\n\nI need to categorize this promise into one of the options provided. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: equitable lien. An equitable lien is a claim against property or assets to satisfy a debt or obligation. It's often used in situations where there's a legal dispute over property rights. In this case, the screenwriter is promising a share of future earnings, not necessarily a claim against specific property. So, this doesn't seem to fit perfectly.\n\nOption B: conditional assignment. A conditional assignment is when rights are assigned to someone else, but only under certain conditions. For example, if a certain event happens, the rights transfer. In this scenario, the screenwriter is promising to give her friend 5% of the proceeds she receives from the movie's distribution. Is this conditional? Well, the proceeds are dependent on the movie being made and distributed, which is a condition. But the promise is to give 5% of whatever she receives, not necessarily assigning the rights themselves.\n\nOption C: irrevocable assignment. An irrevocable assignment is when rights are transferred in such a way that they cannot be taken back or changed. It's a permanent transfer. In this case, the screenwriter is promising to give 5% of the proceeds, but is this an irrevocable assignment? It seems like she's just promising to give away a portion of what she receives, not necessarily assigning the rights irreversibly.\n\nOption D: gratuitous assignment of future rights. A gratuitous assignment is when someone assigns their rights or interests to another person without receiving anything in return. It's essentially a gift. In this scenario, the screenwriter is promising to give her friend 5% of the proceeds she will receive from the movie's distribution. This seems like a gift because she's not getting anything in return for this promise; she's just giving away part of her earnings out of goodwill.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. The screenwriter is not assigning her entire rights to the proceeds; she's just promising to give away a portion of what she receives. So, it's not a full assignment of rights, but rather a promise to share a part of the benefits she gets from those rights.\n\nLooking back at the options, a gratuitous assignment seems to fit best because she's giving away a portion of her future rights without receiving anything in return. It's a gift of a future interest.\n\nBut let's double-check. Is there any condition attached to this promise? The note says, \"I promise that my friend is entitled to 5% of the proceeds I will receive for the distribution of the movie to be made from my screenplay.\" There doesn't seem to be any explicit condition beyond that. The promise is straightforward: give 5% of the proceeds to the friend.\n\nHowever, the proceeds are contingent on the movie being made and distributed, which is an implicit condition. But in this promise, the screenwriter is assuming that if she receives proceeds, she will give 5% to her friend. So, it's conditional in the sense that if she gets money from the movie, she'll give a portion to her friend.\n\nBut is this a conditional assignment? An assignment typically involves transferring rights to another person, whereas here, she's just promising to give a share of what she receives. It's more of a promise to pay a portion of future earnings rather than assigning the rights themselves.\n\nAn assignment would involve transferring the right to receive the proceeds, whereas here, she's keeping the right to receive the proceeds and just promising to share a part of them. So, maybe it's not a true assignment.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's more accurate to consider this as a gratuitous assignment of future rights, meaning she's gifting a portion of her future rights to her friend without any consideration in return.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a contract for the sale of a future interest. But that doesn't seem to fit because there's no sale; it's a gift.\n\nLet me consider the nature of the promise. The screenwriter is promising to give her friend 5% of the proceeds she will receive from the movie's distribution. This sounds like a promise to transfer a portion of her future earnings to her friend.\n\nIn contract law, this could be seen as a contract for the assignment of future rights, where the assignor (the screenwriter) is promising to transfer a share of future benefits to the assignee (her friend).\n\nBut since there's no consideration from the friend, it's a gratuitous assignment. That is, she's giving away a part of her future rights without receiving anything in return.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the most appropriate choice: a gratuitous assignment of future rights.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way to interpret this. Could it be an equitable lien? Well, an equitable lien would involve the friend having a claim against the proceeds to satisfy a debt or obligation. But in this scenario, there's no debt or obligation; it's just a promise to give a share of future earnings. So, that doesn't seem right.\n\nConditional assignment: while there is a condition implied (that the movie is made and distributed, and she receives proceeds), the assignment itself is not conditional in the sense that the right to the 5% is immediate upon the promise, but the ability to enforce it may be contingent on the movie being made and distributed.\n\nIrrevocable assignment: this would imply that the rights have been permanently transferred and cannot be taken back. But in this case, the screenwriter is not transferring the rights themselves; she's just promising to give a portion of what she receives from those rights.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate interpretation is that it's a gratuitous assignment of future rights. The screenwriter is gifting a portion of her future rights to her friend without any consideration in return.\n\nTo summarize, the promise to pay 5% of the proceeds to the friend is best interpreted as a gratuitous assignment of future rights.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
