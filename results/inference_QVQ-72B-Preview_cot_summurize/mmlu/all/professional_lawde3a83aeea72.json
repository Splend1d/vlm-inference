                    "text": "Let's dive into this legal conundrum. So, we've got three people: a man, his nephew, and his son, each owning contiguous lots in the city. The land slopes downward from the man's property to the son's. The man and the nephew have their lots in a natural, unimproved state, while the son has been living in a house he built on his lot for ten years.\n\nIn 2009, the man decides to spruce up his land by planting trees and shrubbery along the boundary that he shares with his nephew. Then, in 2010, the nephew starts preparing his lot to build a house. He excavates an eight-foot-deep area for a basement. During this excavation, the side closest to the man's property collapses, causing some of the man's soil, trees, and shrubbery to fall into the hole. The nephew then hauls away the debris.\n\nNow, the man is suing the nephew to recover damages for the harm done to his land. The question is, who should win this lawsuit?\n\nLet's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the relationship between these properties and the actions taken by the man and the nephew.\n\nThe man planted trees and shrubbery on his land along the boundary with the nephew's lot. The nephew then excavated his land for a basement, and during this process, the boundary wall collapsed, causing damage to the man's property.\n\nSo, the issue here revolves around the support that one piece of land owes to another, especially when one party is excavating and potentially undermining the neighboring land.\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\nA. The nephew, if he was conducting the excavation work non-negligently.\n\nThis option suggests that if the nephew was careful and didn't act negligently during the excavation, he shouldn't be liable for the damage. But is that true?\n\nIn law, when it comes to excavation and supporting neighboring land, there are generally duties that the excavating party must adhere to. Even if the work is done non-negligently, if the excavation causes damage to the neighboring property, there might still be liability.\n\nHowever, there is a concept called \"reasonable care,\" where if the excavator takes all reasonable precautions and the damage still occurs, they might not be liable. But this can vary depending on jurisdiction.\n\nB. The nephew, because he was under no duty to support the man's land in its improved state.\n\nHere, it's suggested that since the man improved his land with trees and shrubbery, the nephew doesn't have to support those improvements.\n\nThis could be relevant because in some legal systems, the duty to support the natural land may exist, but there's no duty to support improvements made by the neighboring landowner.\n\nSo, if the man's improvements (trees and shrubbery) were damaged, perhaps the nephew isn't responsible for those damages.\n\nBut, the man's land itself was also damaged (soil fell into the hole), so there might still be liability for that natural land.\n\nC. The man, because a landowner is entitled to support of his land in its natural condition.\n\nThis option emphasizes that the man's natural land should be supported by the neighboring land.\n\nIf the nephew's excavation caused the man's natural land to collapse, then the man should be entitled to compensation.\n\nHowever, this might not consider the man's improvements (trees and shrubbery), which were added later.\n\nD. The man, because a landowner has an absolute right to have his land supported by the neighboring land.\n\nThis seems similar to option C but uses the term \"absolute right.\"\n\nIn some jurisdictions, there is an absolute right to have one's land supported by neighboring land, meaning that any excavation that causes damage could be liable, regardless of whether it was done negligently or not.\n\nBut, this is a strong statement, and not all legal systems recognize an absolute right to support.\n\nNow, considering these options, let's think about the general principles of law regarding support between neighboring lands.\n\nThere are generally two types of support: lateral support and subjacent support.\n\nLateral support refers to the support that one piece of land gives to the land immediately adjacent to it, while subjacent support refers to the support given to the land above by the land below.\n\nIn this scenario, it seems like we're dealing with lateral support, since the collapse occurred along the boundary between the man's and the nephew's properties.\n\nIn common law, there is a principle that each landowner has the right to the natural support of their land from neighboring lands. This means that a landowner cannot do anything that would deprive the neighboring land of the support it naturally had before any interference.\n\nHowever, when a landowner excavates their land, they have to take certain precautions to ensure that they don't cause the neighboring land to collapse.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, the excavating landowner has a duty to provide reasonable support to the neighboring land to prevent such collapses.\n\nIf they fail to do so, and damage occurs, they can be held liable for the damages caused.\n\nIn this case, the nephew excavated his land, and as a result, the man's land collapsed, causing damage.\n\nSo, unless the nephew can show that he took all reasonable precautions and that the collapse was unavoidable, he might be liable.\n\nNow, considering the options again:\n\nA. If the nephew was non-negligent, meaning he took all reasonable precautions, he might not be liable.\n\nBut, in some legal systems, there might still be strict liability for certain types of activities like excavation.\n\nB. The nephew has no duty to support improvements.\n\nIf the man's improvements (trees and shrubbery) were damaged, but the natural land was also damaged, then perhaps only the improvements are not entitled to support.\n\nBut, the natural land still needs to be supported.\n\nC. The man is entitled to support of his land in its natural condition.\n\nYes, generally, landowners have the right to the natural support of their land.\n\nD. Absolute right to have land supported.\n\nThis is a stronger statement and may not hold in all jurisdictions.\n\nGiven this, it seems that the man has a right to have his natural land supported by the neighboring land.\n\nIf the nephew's excavation caused the man's land to collapse, then the nephew should be liable for the damages.\n\nUnless, of course, the nephew can prove that the collapse was due to some other cause, or that he took all reasonable precautions.\n\nBut, based on the information provided, it seems that the collapse was directly caused by the excavation, and therefore, the nephew is responsible.\n\nHowever, regarding the improvements (trees and shrubbery), it's possible that the nephew doesn't have to compensate for those, as they are not part of the natural land.\n\nBut, again, the natural land itself was damaged, as soil fell into the hole.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that the man should prevail in this case, at least for the damages to his natural land.\n\nSo, the answer is C. The man, because a landowner is entitled to support of his land in its natural condition.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that the nephew could be excused.\n\nFor example, if the man had overburdened his land with excessive improvements, perhaps making it unstable, then the nephew might not be liable.\n\nBut, in this case, the man only planted trees and shrubbery along the boundary, which seems like a normal improvement and not an excessive burden.\n\nMoreover, the nephew's excavation directly caused the collapse, so it's hard to see how he wouldn't be responsible.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
