                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about the emission spectrum of a doubly ionized lithium atom, which is Li++, and it's comparing it to a hydrogen atom. The problem says that the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to that of a hydrogen atom, but all the wavelengths are changed by a certain factor. I need to figure out what that factor is from the given options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a doubly ionized lithium atom means. Lithium has an atomic number Z = 3, which means it has three protons in its nucleus. Normally, it has three electrons, but if it's doubly ionized, that means two electrons have been removed, so it has only one electron left. So, Li++ essentially has one electron, just like hydrogen, but its nucleus has three protons instead of one.\n\nHydrogen has Z = 1, and Li++ has Z = 3, but both have only one electron. So, their electronic transitions should follow the same principles, but maybe scaled differently because of the different nuclear charges.\n\nI recall that in hydrogen-like atoms, the wavelength of the emitted light during a transition between energy levels is given by the Rydberg formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda} = R_Z \\left( \\frac{1}{n_1^2} - \\frac{1}{n_2^2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of the emitted light,\n\n- \\(R_Z\\) is the Rydberg constant for that atom,\n\n- \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) are the principal quantum numbers of the initial and final energy levels, with \\(n_2 > n_1\\).\n\nThe Rydberg constant for hydrogen-like atoms is given by:\n\n\\[\nR_Z = R_{\\infty} Z^2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(R_{\\infty}\\) is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen (Z = 1), and Z is the atomic number.\n\nSo, for hydrogen, Z = 1, and for Li++, Z = 3.\n\nLet me plug in these values to see how the wavelengths compare.\n\nFirst, for hydrogen:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda_H} = R_{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{n_1^2} - \\frac{1}{n_2^2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nFor Li++, which has Z = 3:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{Li}} = R_{\\infty} (3)^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{n_1^2} - \\frac{1}{n_2^2} \\right) = 9 R_{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{n_1^2} - \\frac{1}{n_2^2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, comparing \\(\\lambda_H\\) and \\(\\lambda_{Li}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{Li}} = 9 \\times \\frac{1}{\\lambda_H}\n\\]\n\nWhich means:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{Li} = \\frac{\\lambda_H}{9}\n\\]\n\nSo, the wavelength for Li++ is \\(\\frac{1}{9}\\) times the wavelength of hydrogen for the same transition between the same energy levels.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. decreased by a factor of 9\n\nB. decreased by a factor of 49\n\nC. decreased by a factor of 81\n\nD. increased by a factor of 9\n\nSo, option A seems to match my calculation. But wait, let me double-check.\n\nIf \\(\\lambda_{Li} = \\frac{\\lambda_H}{9}\\), that means the wavelength is decreased by a factor of 9, which corresponds to option A.\n\nBut let me think again. Is there any other factor I should consider? For example, does the mass of the nucleus affect the Rydberg constant? In hydrogen, the Rydberg constant is adjusted for the reduced mass of the electron interacting with the proton. However, since both hydrogen and Li++ are being compared using \\(R_{\\infty}\\), which is the Rydberg constant for an infinitely massive nucleus, and assuming the nuclear masses are large enough that the reduced mass correction is negligible, then the above calculation should hold.\n\nAdditionally, the problem states that the emission spectrum is identical, meaning the transitions follow the same pattern, just scaled by Z^2.\n\nTherefore, the wavelengths for Li++ are indeed \\(\\frac{1}{9}\\) times those of hydrogen, meaning they are decreased by a factor of 9.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option A: decreased by a factor of 9.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect this.\n\nThe atomic number Z for Li++ is 3, and for hydrogen is 1, so Z^2 is 9, which is already accounted for.\n\nOption B suggests decreased by 49, which would correspond to Z^2 for Z=7, but that's not relevant here.\n\nOption C is decreased by 81, which would be Z^4 for Z=3, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption D says increased by a factor of 9, which would be incorrect based on the calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: decreased by a factor of 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
