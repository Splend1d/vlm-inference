                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Shapiro's view on drug use and drug laws. The question says that according to Shapiro, the standard view has to explain the preeminence of controlled use by arguing that... And then there are four options:\n\nA. Controlled use is preeminent.\n\nB. Drug laws have no effect on access to illegal drugs.\n\nC. Drug laws reduce access to illegal drugs.\n\nD. Drug laws increase access to illegal drugs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"preeminence of controlled use\" means. I think \"controlled use\" refers to the idea that drug use can be regulated or managed in some way, perhaps through legal controls or policies. \"Preeminence\" suggests that this approach is the most important or dominant one.\n\nSo, the standard view is that controlled use is preeminent, meaning it's the primary way to handle drug use. Now, the question is asking how this view explains its own preeminence. In other words, what's the argument that makes controlled use the dominant approach?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Controlled use is preeminent.\n\nThis seems tautological. It's just restating the preeminence without explaining it.\n\nB. Drug laws have no effect on access to illegal drugs.\n\nThis suggests that drug laws don't influence how easy or hard it is to get illegal drugs. If that's the case, then maybe the standard view is that controlled use is still possible despite ineffective laws.\n\nC. Drug laws reduce access to illegal drugs.\n\nThis implies that drug laws are effective in making it harder to get illegal drugs. So, if drug laws successfully reduce access, then controlled use might be easier to achieve.\n\nD. Drug laws increase access to illegal drugs.\n\nThis seems counterintuitive. If drug laws make it easier to get illegal drugs, that might make controlled use more difficult, not more preeminent.\n\nGiven these options, I need to think about which one best explains why controlled use is considered preeminent in the standard view.\n\nIf drug laws have no effect (option B), then the preeminence of controlled use might be based on the idea that even without effective laws, controlled use is still possible through other means, like education or treatment programs.\n\nIf drug laws reduce access (option C), that would directly support the idea that controlled use is preeminent because fewer people have access to drugs, making it easier to control their use.\n\nOption D suggests that drug laws increase access, which would seem to undermine the idea of controlled use being preeminent, because if drugs are more accessible, it might be harder to control their use.\n\nOption A is just repeating the preeminence without providing an explanation.\n\nSo, between B and C, which one makes more sense?\n\nIf drug laws reduce access (C), that would directly support the preeminence of controlled use, because it aligns with the idea that laws can effectively manage drug use by limiting access.\n\nIf drug laws have no effect (B), then the preeminence of controlled use would have to be based on other factors, like individual choice or social norms, rather than legal restrictions.\n\nGiven that the question is about the standard view, which likely assumes that drug laws are meant to control drug use, I think option C is the most straightforward explanation.\n\nTherefore, according to Shapiro, the standard view has to explain the preeminence of controlled use by arguing that drug laws reduce access to illegal drugs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
