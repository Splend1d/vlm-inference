                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario about a young woman who joined a social media service for networking with other business people and entities. She found out that the service was selling her personal profile information, along with thousands of other members', to third parties for tracking their internet activities and buying habits. She's filed a class-action lawsuit for breach of contract, claiming two main things: first, that she and the class members are embarrassed and humiliated by the disclosure, and second, that they should be compensated for the market value of the information that was seized.\n\nNow, the question is asking whether the court is likely to recognize these allegations as sufficient to state a claim for breach of contract. There are four options:\n\nA. Yes, because the service breached the duty of good faith inherent in every contract.\n\nB. Yes, because these are common types of damages that are authorized in breach of contract cases.\n\nC. No, because internet laws protect absolutely all communications and downloads of this nature as part of the service's guaranteed scope of free speech rights.\n\nD. No, because humiliation is not an item of damages in a breach of contract case, and the unauthorized collection of personal data does not establish an economic loss.\n\nOkay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the nature of a breach of contract claim. A breach of contract occurs when one party fails to fulfill their obligations under the agreement, causing harm or loss to the other party. In this case, the woman is alleging that the social media service breached the contract by selling her personal information.\n\nNow, regarding the damages she's seeking:\n\n1. Embarrassment and humiliation.\n\n2. The market value of the seized information.\n\nLet's consider each type of damage.\n\nStarting with embarrassment and humiliation: these sound more like non-economic damages, similar to those claimed in tort cases like invasion of privacy or emotional distress. In contract law, typically, damages are meant to compensate for financial losses resulting from the breach. So, is embarrassment and humiliation something that can be compensated for in a contract case?\n\nI recall that in many jurisdictions, contracts may include clauses that allow for non-economic damages, but generally, contract damages are focused on economic loss. However, there are cases where courts have allowed non-economic damages in contract actions, especially when the contract involves personal services or when the breach causes significant emotional distress.\n\nBut, in the context of a social media service, where the contract is likely a terms of service agreement, it's less clear. These agreements often limit the types of damages that can be claimed.\n\nMoving on to the second type of damage: the market value of the seized information. This seems more directly related to economic loss. If the service is profiting by selling the personal information, then the class members might argue that they are entitled to a share of that profit or at least the value of their information.\n\nHowever, determining the market value of personal information can be tricky. It's not like a tangible asset with a clear market price. It would require some evidence or expert testimony to establish what the value of that information is.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption A says yes, because the service breached the duty of good faith inherent in every contract. Well, every contract does indeed imply a duty of good faith and fair dealing. This means that neither party should do anything to deprive the other of the benefits of the contract. Selling personal information without consent could be seen as violating this duty, especially if the terms of service prohibit such actions or require consent.\n\nOption B says yes, because these are common types of damages in breach of contract cases. As I thought earlier, while economic damages are common in contract cases, non-economic damages like embarrassment and humiliation are less typical unless specifically provided for in the contract or permitted by statute.\n\nOption C says no, because internet laws protect absolutely all communications and downloads as part of the service's guaranteed scope of free speech rights. Hmm, this seems a bit of a stretch. While there are laws that protect free speech on the internet, like Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in the U.S., which shields online platforms from liability for user-generated content, I don't think that extends to selling personal information. Selling personal data is more about privacy laws and data protection regulations, not free speech.\n\nOption D says no, because humiliation is not an item of damages in a breach of contract case, and the unauthorized collection of personal data does not establish an economic loss. This seems to align with my earlier thoughts. Humiliation is generally not compensable in contract cases, and the unauthorized collection of data might not directly translate to an economic loss unless there's evidence of actual financial harm.\n\nBut, perhaps there's more to it. Maybe the market value of the information can be considered an economic loss, as it represents the benefit the class members would have received had their information not been misused.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose the contract between the social media service and its users includes provisions about data privacy and the use of personal information. If the service breaches those provisions by selling the information, then the users might have a claim for breach of contract.\n\nIn such a case, the damages would typically be the direct financial loss suffered by the users. So, if they can show that the value of their personal information was, say, X amount, and that value wasappropriated by the service without compensation, then they might be entitled to that amount.\n\nHowever, claiming embarrassment and humiliation on top of that might be seen as punitive or extra-compensatory, which isn't typically allowed in contract cases unless specified.\n\nAdditionally, there might be statutory damages available under data protection laws or privacy statutes, but that's another layer.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the best answer is Option A: yes, because the service breached the duty of good faith inherent in every contract.\n\nThis is because selling personal information without consent (assuming that's what happened) violates the trust and the implied terms of the contract. The duty of good faith requires parties to act honestly and fairly towards each other, and misusing personal data could be seen as a breach of that duty.\n\nOption B is partially correct in that economic damages are common in contract cases, but it doesn't address the specific nature of the damages claimed, especially the non-economic aspects.\n\nOption C is likely incorrect because free speech protections generally don't shield against claims related to privacy violations or data misuse.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while humiliation might not be compensable in a contract case, the market value of the seized information could be considered an economic loss resulting from the breach.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is Option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
