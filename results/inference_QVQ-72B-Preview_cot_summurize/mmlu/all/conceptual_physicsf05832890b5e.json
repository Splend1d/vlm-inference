                    "text": "Let's see what happens when a wave moves from shallow water to deep water. I know that waves can behave differently based on the depth of the water they're traveling through. So, shallow water has different properties compared to deep water, which affects how waves propagate.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic concepts about waves. Waves have characteristics like frequency, wavelength, and speed. Frequency is the number of waves passing a point in a given time, wavelength is the distance between successive crests, and speed is how fast the wave is moving.\n\nNow, the question is about what happens when a wave moves from shallow water to deep water. Specifically, it asks about changes in frequency, wavelength, and speed.\n\nLet me think about frequency first. Frequency is often a property that remains constant, regardless of the medium the wave is traveling through. So, I think frequency doesn't change when a wave moves from shallow to deep water. That means options A and C might be incorrect because they suggest frequency changes.\n\nNext, wavelength. In shallow water, waves are influenced by the bottom, which can affect their wavelength. In deeper water, the wave isn't affected by the bottom, so its behavior might change. I think wavelength increases when moving from shallow to deep water. That seems to align with some of the options.\n\nLastly, speed. I recall that wave speed in deep water is different from shallow water. In shallow water, wave speed is slower because the waves interact with the bottom. In deep water, where there's no interaction with the bottom, wave speed increases.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Frequency: remains the same\n\n- Wavelength: increases\n\n- Speed: increases\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. frequency decreases, wavelength increases, speed increases\n\nB. frequency does not change, wavelength increases, speed increases\n\nC. frequency does not change, wavelength decreases, speed decreases\n\nD. frequency does not change, wavelength increases, speed decreases\n\nOption B seems to match my understanding: frequency doesn't change, wavelength increases, and speed increases.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there's any chance that frequency could change. In most wave phenomena, frequency is determined by the source of the wave and doesn't change when the wave moves into a different medium. So, frequency should remain constant.\n\nWavelength and speed, however, can change based on the properties of the medium. In this case, moving from shallow to deep water, the medium's properties change, affecting wavelength and speed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B: frequency does not change, wavelength increases, and speed increases.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider the relationship between wavelength, frequency, and speed. The formula is:\n\nSpeed = wavelength \u00d7 frequency\n\nIf speed increases and frequency remains constant, then wavelength must increase to compensate for the increase in speed.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, option B is correct.\n\nWait a minute, option D also says frequency does not change, but it suggests that wavelength increases and speed decreases. That would imply that speed = wavelength \u00d7 frequency, and if wavelength increases while frequency stays the same, speed should increase, not decrease. So, option D is incorrect.\n\nOption C says frequency does not change, wavelength decreases, and speed decreases. Again, if frequency is constant and wavelength decreases, speed should decrease, but that contradicts what I know about waves moving from shallow to deep water, where speed should increase.\n\nTherefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption A says frequency decreases, which contradicts what I know about frequency remaining constant, so that's also incorrect.\n\nHence, the correct answer is B.\n\nTo wrap it up, when a wave moves from shallow water to deep water, the frequency remains constant, the wavelength increases, and the speed increases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
