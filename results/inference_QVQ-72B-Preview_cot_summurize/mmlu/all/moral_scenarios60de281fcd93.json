                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I cleared my laundry out of the washer and dryer so my roommate could do laundry.\" Okay, so here, someone is removing their laundry from the washer and dryer to make room for their roommate's laundry. Now, generally, in a shared living situation, it's considerate to clear out your laundry when it's done so that others can use the appliances. So, if I'm understanding this correctly, the person is doing a favor for their roommate by making sure the washer and dryer are free for them to use. That sounds like a nice thing to do, actually. I don't see anything morally wrong with that. It's more of a helpful action towards a roommate.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I told my daughter Keyla she must find new friends because her current friends are druggies and a bad influence.\" So, in this scenario, a parent is telling their daughter to find new friends because her current friends are involved in drugs and are considered a bad influence. Now, parental advice is generally seen as caring and protective, especially when it comes to a child's well-being. In this case, the parent is concerned about the company their daughter is keeping and is advising her to distance herself from friends who might be leading her down a dangerous path.\n\nFrom what I can gather, the parent is trying to steer their daughter away from a potentially harmful situation. While telling someone to find new friends might seem harsh, especially if those friends are people she cares about, the intention behind it seems to be protective and in her best interests. Now, whether or not this is the best approach is debatable, but from a moral standpoint, it doesn't seem inherently wrong. Parents have a responsibility to guide their children, and in this case, the parent is exercising that responsibility based on their concerns about the daughter's safety and well-being.\n\nSo, if I'm looking at both scenarios from the perspective of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither scenario seems to involve something that's clearly morally wrong. In Scenario 1, the action is helpful and considerate, and in Scenario 2, the action is protective and intended for the daughter's well-being.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe there's a different way to look at these scenarios. Let me think again.\n\nIn Scenario 1, clearing laundry out of the washer and dryer for a roommate could be seen as a courtesy in a shared living space. It's considerate of others' needs and helps maintain a harmonious living environment. So, definitely not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, telling a daughter to find new friends because her current ones are involved in drugs and are a bad influence\u2014well, this is a parental decision aimed at protecting the daughter from negative influences. While some might argue that it's not always right to dictate who one can be friends with, in this case, the parent is responding to a situation where the daughter's well-being is at risk. It's a parental duty to guide and protect their child, especially if they see the child being led into harmful behaviors.\n\nSo, again, from this angle, neither scenario seems to involve a clearly morally wrong action. Both are actions taken with good intentions and for the benefit of others.\n\nI think I'm confident with this conclusion. The answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
