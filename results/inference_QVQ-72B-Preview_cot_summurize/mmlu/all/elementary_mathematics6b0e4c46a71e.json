                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: A teacher puts 5 packages of craft paper into a cabinet. Each package has 80 sheets of paper. What is the total number of sheets of craft paper that the teacher puts into the cabinet?\n\nAlright, let's see. I need to find the total number of sheets, and there are 5 packages, each containing 80 sheets. So, it seems like I need to multiply the number of packages by the number of sheets per package.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal sheets = number of packages \u00d7 sheets per package\n\nTotal sheets = 5 \u00d7 80\n\nOkay, so 5 times 80. Let me think about how to do that multiplication.\n\nFirst, I know that 5 times 8 is 40. Since the sheets are in tens, maybe I can think of it as 5 times 8 tens.\n\nSo, 5 \u00d7 8 = 40, and since it's tens, that means 40 tens, which is 400.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 80 as 8 tens, and multiplying by 5 gives 40 tens, which is 400.\n\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\nLet me consider another way. Maybe breaking it down further.\n\n5 \u00d7 80 = 5 \u00d7 (8 \u00d7 10) = (5 \u00d7 8) \u00d7 10 = 40 \u00d7 10 = 400.\n\nOkay, so all these methods give me 400.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 40\n\nB. 85\n\nC. 400\n\nD. 450\n\nSo, option C is 400.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nThe teacher puts 5 packages into the cabinet, and each package has 80 sheets. So, it's straightforward multiplication: 5 \u00d7 80.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here, like considering only part of a package or anything like that.\n\nLet me see if maybe I should add something. If there are leftover sheets, but no, the problem says each package has 80 sheets, so I assume all packages are full, and there are no partial packages.\n\nSo, total sheets should be 5 times 80, which is 400.\n\nWait, but let's consider if the packages are being stacked or something, but no, that doesn't affect the count.\n\nNo, I think it's simply 5 \u00d7 80 = 400.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 400.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can count them manually for smaller numbers. Suppose there was 1 package with 80 sheets. Total sheets would be 80.\n\nIf there are 2 packages, total sheets would be 160.\n\n3 packages would be 240.\n\n4 packages would be 320.\n\n5 packages would be 400.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is C. 400.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
