                    "text": "So I've got this question here about ethical guidelines that all public institutions subscribe to, and it's asking which one of these options is NOT necessarily followed by them. The options are:\n\nA. Avoiding unnecessary deception to humans\n\nB. Avoiding unnecessary pain to humans and other animals\n\nC. Avoiding use of animals when computers are available\n\nD. Protecting confidentiality\n\nAlright, let's think through this step by step.\n\nFirst off, public institutions, especially those involved in research or education, typically adhere to strict ethical standards to ensure that their practices are morally and legally sound. So, it's important to understand what each of these options means in that context.\n\nStarting with option A: avoiding unnecessary deception to humans. This seems straightforward. Deception in research can sometimes be necessary, especially in social sciences or psychology experiments where the participant's behavior might be influenced if they know the true nature of the study. However, such deception is generally considered ethical only if it's essential to the study's objectives and doesn't involve any harm or significant risk to the participants. So, institutions would typically require that any deception is justified and minimized as much as possible. Therefore, avoiding unnecessary deception seems like a standard ethical guideline.\n\nMoving on to option B: avoiding unnecessary pain to humans and other animals. This is a fundamental principle in ethics, known as the principle of nonmaleficence, which obligates researchers to avoid causing harm or pain to study participants. In the context of human subjects, this involves ensuring that any potential risks are minimized and that participants are fully informed about possible discomforts. For animals, it's about ensuring that their welfare is protected and that any procedures involving them are justified and carried out humanely. So, again, this seems like a core ethical consideration for public institutions.\n\nOption C: avoiding use of animals when computers are available. This one is a bit more specific. It touches on the replacement principle in animal research, which encourages the use of alternative methods, like computer simulations, that can reduce or replace the use of animals in experiments. While this is an important goal, it's not necessarily a universal ethical guideline that all public institutions must strictly adhere to. Some institutions might have policies promoting the replacement of animal use where feasible, but it's not a universal standard across all public institutions. There might be cases where animal research is still necessary despite the availability of computer models, especially if those models are not yet sophisticated enough to provide reliable data for certain types of research.\n\nLastly, option D: protecting confidentiality. This is a crucial aspect of research ethics, particularly concerning human subjects. It involves safeguarding participants' personal information and ensuring that their responses or data are not disclosed in a way that could identify them. Confidentiality helps build trust between researchers and participants and is a legal requirement in many jurisdictions. Therefore, protecting confidentiality is a standard ethical practice in public institutions.\n\nGiven this analysis, option C\u2014avoiding use of animals when computers are available\u2014seems to be the one that public institutions do NOT all necessarily subscribe to as an absolute ethical guideline. While it's a desirable objective and many institutions strive towards it, it's not a universal requirement or standard across all public institutions, especially in cases where animal research is still deemed necessary for scientific advancement.\n\nSo, my answer would be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
