                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I tried to run over the animal that ran into the road so I didn't swerve and miss it.\"\n\nHmm, this is tricky. So, an animal runs into the road, and instead of swerving to miss it, the person decides to hit it intentionally. Now, generally, in the US, we value animal life, especially if it's a wild animal or a pet. Hitting an animal on purpose seems cruel and unethical. But maybe there's more to consider here.\n\nPerhaps the person thought that swerving could cause more harm, like losing control of the vehicle or endangering other drivers. In that case, choosing to hit the animal might be seen as a lesser evil to prevent potential harm to humans or further property damage. But even then, intentionally trying to run over an animal still feels morally wrong because it shows a disregard for the animal's life.\n\nLet me consider some ethical principles here. There's the principle of double effect, which allows for actions that have both good and bad effects, provided that the bad effect is not intended. So, if someone swerves to avoid hitting an animal and ends up causing an accident, the accident is an unintended negative consequence of a good action. Conversely, if someone hits the animal intentionally to avoid swerving and potentially causing an accident, the intention to harm the animal is what makes it morally problematic.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the person didn't intend to harm the animal out of malice, but rather to prevent a worse outcome. But still, the direct action is to try to run over the animal, which is a harmful act. Maybe it's a case of choosing the lesser evil, but that doesn't necessarily make the act itself morally right.\n\nI should also consider the potential consequences. If the person swerves and misses the animal, they might avoid hurting the animal but risk their own safety or that of others. On the other hand, hitting the animal would likely kill or injure it, which is morally distressing.\n\nIn many states, there are laws about hitting animals with vehicles. For example, in some places, you're required to report hitting a deer or another large animal. But I don't think there's a general law that says you should try to hit the animal intentionally.\n\nFrom an environmental perspective, hitting an animal could be seen as detrimental because it reduces biodiversity or harms ecosystems. But again, that might not be the primary concern in this scenario.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose the animal is small, like a squirrel. Would it be morally wrong to hit a squirrel intentionally to avoid swerving into oncoming traffic? It still feels wrong, but perhaps less so than hitting a larger or more intelligent animal, like a dog or a horse.\n\nAlternatively, if the animal is already injured or suffering, hitting it might be seen as euthanasia, but that seems like a stretch in this context.\n\nOverall, I think trying to run over an animal intentionally is morally wrong because it shows a disregard for the animal's life and well-being. Even if the person is trying to prevent a worse outcome, the act of intentionally harming the animal is ethically problematic.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: \"I decided to dam the river upstream of a lot of farmland.\"\n\nThis one is interesting. Damming a river can have various effects, both positive and negative. On the positive side, dams can provide hydroelectric power, irrigation water, flood control, and recreational areas. However, they can also have negative impacts, such as disrupting fish migration, altering water temperature and flow, and flooding upstream areas, which might include farmland.\n\nIn this scenario, the person is planning to dam the river upstream of farmland. Depending on the size of the dam and the river, this could lead to flooding of the farmland, which could destroy crops, contaminate soil, and cause financial loss to farmers. Additionally, it could affect the local ecosystem and wildlife dependent on the river.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, this action could be seen as morally wrong because it shows a lack of consideration for the people and environments downstream. It's possible that the person didn't think through the consequences or didn't care about the impact on others.\n\nOn the other hand, perhaps the person had a good reason for damming the river, such as creating a water supply for the community or generating renewable energy. If the benefits outweigh the costs, then the action might be justifiable.\n\nHowever, in the absence of such justifications, damming the river seems reckless and morally wrong, especially if it causes harm to others without their consent.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, both involve actions that could cause harm\u2014hitting an animal and damming a river\u2014but the nature of the harm differs. Hitting an animal primarily causes harm to the animal and possibly the driver, while damming a river could cause widespread harm to people, property, and the environment.\n\nGiven that, I would say that both actions are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a perspective where one of these actions isn't morally wrong.\n\nFor example, in some situations, hitting an animal might be seen as necessary to prevent greater harm. If swerving would cause a multi-car accident, then hitting the animal might be the lesser evil. However, intentionally trying to run over the animal still seems morally suspect, even if the intention is to prevent worse harm.\n\nSimilarly, with damming the river, if it's done with the intention of providing a public good and the negative impacts are unintended side effects, perhaps it could be seen as morally acceptable. But in the scenario presented, it seems like the person is deciding to dam the river without considering the consequences, which makes it morally irresponsible.\n\nTherefore, I still think both actions are morally wrong.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the person damming the river is doing it for personal gain, say, to create a private lake for their property, without considering the impact on downstream farmers. That would make it even more morally wrong, as it's a self-serving action that harms others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the person is building a small dam for irrigation purposes, benefiting their own farm while negatively affecting others downstream. Again, without consent or compensation, this seems morally problematic.\n\nIn any case, without justification for the action, damming the river appears to be morally wrong.\n\nSo, my final answer is A. Wrong, Wrong."
