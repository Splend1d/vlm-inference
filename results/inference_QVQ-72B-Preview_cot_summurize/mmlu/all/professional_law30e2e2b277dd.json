                    "text": "So I've got this property law scenario here, and I need to figure out which argument would give this woman the best chance to build a service station on her land, despite some restrictions. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, back in 1954, a conservationist owned a piece of land and gave it to his aunt with some conditions. The deed said that the land was given to the aunt \"in fee simple,\" but with a provision that neither she nor her heirs or assigns could use the property for any commercial purpose. If the land was used for anything other than residential purposes, the original owner or his successors could reclaim the property.\n\nOkay, so there's a restriction against commercial use, and if violated, the property can be taken back by the original owner or their successors.\n\nThe aunt then developed the land into a residential subdivision from 1960 to 1969, dividing it into 100-acre lots, each one acre, and sold them all during that decade. Most were used for single-family homes, except four lots that were sold to an investor in 1968. The deed to the investor included the same restriction against commercial use.\n\nIn 1980, a bank foreclosed on the investor's four lots and then sold them to a woman. The deed to the woman didn't mention the restriction. Now, in the present time, the woman wants to build a service station on her parcel, which is presumably one of those four lots.\n\nShe's facing a restriction that says the land can't be used for commercial purposes. She needs to find a way around that restriction to build her service station.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The restriction against residential use is void as violative of the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nWait a minute, the restriction is against commercial use, not against residential use. Actually, it says the land can't be used for any commercial purpose and must be used for residential purposes. So, if the restriction is against commercial use, and she wants to build a service station, which is commercial, that's a problem.\n\nBut option A says the restriction against residential use is void. However, the restriction is against commercial use, not against residential use. So, this seems misplaced. Maybe it's a typo, and it should say \"against commercial use,\" but as it stands, it doesn't match.\n\nB. The commercial development surrounding the property has made the deed restriction unenforceable.\n\nThis suggests that because the area around her property has become commercial, the restriction on her land is no longer enforceable. Maybe there's a doctrine that says if the character of the neighborhood changes, restrictions can be challenged.\n\nC. When the woman purchased the property from the bank, the deed did not contain any mention of the restriction.\n\nThis is interesting. If the deed she received from the bank didn't include the restriction, maybe she isn't bound by it. But I think restrictions can sometimes run with the land, especially if they're properly recorded.\n\nD. The jurisdiction approved a zoning ordinance permitting commercial development in the area surrounding the woman's property.\n\nZoning ordinances can override deed restrictions in some cases, especially if the restrictions are in conflict with public policy or if the area has been rezoned for commercial use.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully.\n\nFirst, the original deed from the conservationist to his aunt included a restriction against commercial use, with a reversionary clause if violated. This was properly recorded, so it should be part of the public record.\n\nThe aunt then developed the land into a subdivision, selling lots with the same restriction passed on to the buyers, including the investor who bought four lots in 1968.\n\nIn 1980, the bank foreclosed on the investor's lots and sold them to the woman, and the deed to her didn't include the restriction.\n\nNow, the woman wants to build a service station, which is commercial, but there's a restriction against commercial use.\n\nShe needs to argue why the restriction shouldn't apply to her.\n\nOption A seems off because it refers to \"residential use,\" but the restriction is against commercial use.\n\nOption B suggests that the surrounding commercial development makes the restriction unenforceable. Maybe if the character of the neighborhood has changed, the restriction could be challenged as no longer serving its original purpose.\n\nOption C notes that her deed didn't include the restriction. This could be significant because if the restriction wasn't included in her deed, she might not be bound by it.\n\nOption D mentions that the jurisdiction has approved a zoning ordinance allowing commercial development in the area around her property. If the area is zoned for commercial use, that might override the deed restriction.\n\nLet me consider these one by one.\n\nStarting with Option C: her deed didn't include the restriction.\n\nIn property law, restrictions can run with the land if they are properly created as covenants running with the land. For a covenant to run with the land, it generally needs to benefit and burden the land, and be intended to do so.\n\nHowever, if a subsequent deed doesn't include the restriction, does that mean the restriction doesn't apply to the new owner?\n\nWell, typically, if a restriction is recorded, it's part of the public record, and subsequent buyers are charged with knowledge of it, even if their deed doesn't explicitly include it.\n\nBut, in this case, the original deed was properly recorded, so the restriction is part of the public record.\n\nThe bank, having foreclosed, may not have been bound by the restriction if they weren't aware of it or if it wasn't properly noticed to them.\n\nWait, banks are usually sophisticated parties and are presumed to know about recorded restrictions.\n\nBut, in any case, if the restriction is recorded, it should bind subsequent buyers, even if their deed doesn't include it.\n\nSo, Option C might not be the strongest argument because the restriction is likely still binding on the property, regardless of whether it was included in her deed.\n\nNow, Option D: the jurisdiction has approved a zoning ordinance permitting commercial development in the area surrounding the woman's property.\n\nZoning ordinances are regulations imposed by local governments to control land use. They can sometimes conflict with private deed restrictions.\n\nIn such cases, generally, zoning ordinances prevail over private restrictions because they are exercises of the police power for the public welfare.\n\nHowever, deed restrictions can sometimes be enforced despite zoning changes if they are properly recorded and still valid.\n\nBut, in many jurisdictions, if the area has been zoned for commercial use, and the restriction is against commercial use, the zoning might override the restriction.\n\nSo, this could be a strong argument for the woman.\n\nOption B: the commercial development surrounding the property has made the deed restriction unenforceable.\n\nThis might relate to the doctrine of changed circumstances or abandonment.\n\nIf the character of the neighborhood has changed significantly, such that the original purpose of the restriction is no longer served, the restriction might be unenforceable.\n\nFor example, if the entire area around her property is now commercial, maintaining her property as residential might not make sense, and the restriction could be challenged on that basis.\n\nHowever, this might be a weaker argument compared to Option D, which directly cites a zoning ordinance that permits commercial use.\n\nOption A: as I said earlier, it's misstated because it refers to \"residential use,\" but the restriction is against commercial use. So, unless there's a typo, this doesn't seem relevant.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think Option D is the strongest argument for the woman. If the jurisdiction has approved a zoning ordinance that permits commercial development in the area, that might override the private deed restriction against commercial use.\n\nMoreover, if the surrounding area is zoned commercial and has been developed commercially, her property being restricted to residential use could be an anomaly that the court might not enforce, especially if it goes against the zoning plan.\n\nTherefore, the best argument for the woman to build her service station would be Option D: the jurisdiction has approved a zoning ordinance permitting commercial development in the area surrounding her property.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
