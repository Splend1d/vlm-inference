The bar review course agreed to pay the graduate a starting salary of $2,500 a month. Three months later, the graduate was approached by the regional director of the bar review course, who handed her a newly published 60-page booklet entitled \"Employment Manual. \" He instructed the graduate to read the manual and indicated that it contained important information concerning company policy considerations and employee benefits.

She never got around to reading the rest of the manual. Six months later, the graduate received a termination notice from the bar review course. The notice indicated that the graduate was being fired for insubordination because she had complained about the poor quality of the bar review course's materials and refused to work overtime grading papers.

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario about a law school graduate who was hired by a bar review course as an editorial consultant. They had an oral agreement, and she was supposed to do stuff like preparing course outlines, proofreading, and grading student assignments. Her starting salary was $2,500 a month. After three months, she was given an \"Employment Manual\" by the regional director and was told it contained important information about company policies and employee benefits. She started reading it but got tired after 30 pages and never finished it. Then, six months later, she got fired for insubordination because she complained about the quality of the course materials and refused to work overtime grading papers. She sued for breach of contract, and now I need to figure out which option provides the best defense for the bar review course.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a breach of contract is. It's when one party fails to fulfill their obligations as per the agreement. In this case, the graduate claims that the bar review course breached their contract by firing her. So, the defense needs to show that there was no breach, meaning that firing her was allowed under the terms of their agreement.\n\nOption A says that all other employees worked overtime whenever requested. Hmm, that might be relevant if the graduate's refusal to work overtime was a key reason for her termination. If it's common practice for employees to work overtime and she refused, that could be seen as insubordination. But, this option doesn't directly address the contract terms. It's more about the workplace culture.\n\nOption B says that when the graduate accepted employment, the company never made any promises about job security or duration of employment. This could be important because if there were no promises about how long the job would last or under what conditions she could be fired, it might support an at-will employment arrangement, where either party can terminate employment at any time for any reason. However, in some jurisdictions, continued employment can imply a contractual relationship, so this might not be sufficient on its own.\n\nOption C mentions that the bar review course materials were reviewed by the American Bar Association's Committee on Legal Education and received high acclaim. This seems irrelevant to the breach of contract claim. The quality of the course materials might be related to her complaints, but that doesn't directly bear on whether the company breached the employment contract by firing her.\n\nOption D refers to the second page of the employment manual, which states that all policies, guidelines, and employee benefits are \"purely gratuitous and not intended to create any ongoing contractual obligation.\" This seems significant. If the manual clearly states that its contents are not intended to create a contractual obligation, it could mean that the employee shouldn't have relied on the manual's provisions as part of the employment contract. This could be crucial because if the graduate didn't read the manual, she might not have been aware of this disclaimer.\n\nBut wait, she was given the manual three months into her employment and was instructed to read it, but she only read 30 pages and never finished it. So, she might not have seen this disclaimer if it was on page 2. If she didn't read that part, can the company still claim she was bound by it?\n\nWell, generally, in employment law, if an employee is provided with a manual and instructed to read it, they are presumed to know and be bound by its contents, even if they didn't actually read it. So, even if she didn't read the whole manual, the fact that she was instructed to do so might mean that she's still bound by its terms.\n\nTherefore, option D seems like the strongest defense because it directly addresses whether the employment manual created any contractual obligations. If the manual explicitly states that its contents are not intended to create contractual obligations, then any policies or benefits described in the manual wouldn't be part of the employment contract. This could help the company argue that firing her for insubordination didn't breach any contractual terms, especially if the manual didn't guarantee employment security or restrict the company's ability to terminate her employment.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way to look at this. The graduate was hired under an oral agreement, which likely specified her duties and salary, but maybe not the conditions under which she could be terminated. The employment manual might have included additional terms or policies that could affect her employment status.\n\nIf the manual included a statement that the company could terminate employment at will, except for certain specified reasons, and her insubordination falls within those specified reasons, then firing her wouldn't be a breach of contract.\n\nAlternatively, if the manual didn't contain any such restrictions and had the disclaimer mentioned in option D, then the company could argue that there were no contractual limitations on termination.\n\nOption A, about other employees working overtime, might support the company's position that working overtime is expected, and refusing to do so is insubordination, but it doesn't directly address the contract terms.\n\nOption B, about no promises regarding job security, is somewhat weak because it's based on the absence of promises at hiring. If there was nothing in writing, and the manual includes a disclaimer, option D is stronger.\n\nOption C is irrelevant to the contract dispute.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option D seems to be the best defense for the bar review course.\n\nWait a minute, but what if the graduate can argue that she didn't read the manual, so the disclaimer shouldn't apply to her? Well, as I thought earlier, generally, employees are expected to be aware of company policies once they're provided with them, whether they read them or not. So, even if she didn't read the manual, the company might still be able to rely on the disclaimer.\n\nI think that reinforces the idea that option D is the strongest defense.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
