                    "text": "So I've got this question here about multiplication and whether the products are even or odd. There are four statements, and I need to pick the true one. Let me go through each option carefully.\n\nStarting with option A: \"The product of 5 x 2 is even because both of the factors are even.\" Hmm, wait a minute. Is that right? Let me check. First, what's the product of 5 and 2? Well, 5 times 2 is 10, and 10 is even. So, the product is indeed even. But the statement says that both factors are even. Is that true? 5 is odd, and 2 is even. So, they're saying both factors are even, but in reality, one is odd and one is even. So, this statement is incorrect because it claims both factors are even when they're not.\n\nMoving on to option B: \"The product of 4 x 4 is odd because both of the factors are even.\" Okay, let's see. 4 times 4 is 16, and 16 is even. So, the product is even, but the statement says it's odd. That's a problem right there. Plus, it says both factors are even, which is true because 4 is even. But since the product is even and they say it's odd, this statement is false.\n\nNext is option C: \"The product of 2 x 7 is even because both of the factors are odd.\" Well, 2 times 7 is 14, which is even. So, the product is even, but the statement says both factors are odd. But 2 is even and 7 is odd. So, again, the reasoning is incorrect. Even though the product is even, the justification is wrong because they said both factors are odd when one is even.\n\nLastly, option D: \"The product of 5 x 3 is odd because both of the factors are odd.\" Let's check this. 5 times 3 is 15, and 15 is odd. So, the product is indeed odd. Now, both factors are odd\u20145 is odd, and 3 is odd. So, the statement matches the reality. Both factors are odd, and the product is odd.\n\nSo, comparing all options:\n\n- Option A: Product is even, but incorrectly states both factors are even.\n\n- Option B: Product is even, but states it's odd.\n\n- Option C: Product is even, but incorrectly states both factors are odd.\n\n- Option D: Product is odd, and both factors are odd, which matches reality.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is option D.\n\nWait a second, but let's double-check. Maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing. Let's verify each part.\n\nFirst, what's the product of 5 and 3? 5 times 3 is indeed 15, which is odd. So, that part is correct.\n\nSecond, are both factors odd? Yes, 5 is odd, and 3 is odd.\n\nThird, the statement says the product is odd because both factors are odd. Is that a valid reasoning? Well, in general, the product of two odd numbers is indeed odd. Let's confirm with an example: 3 times 5 is 15, which is odd; 5 times 7 is 35, which is odd; 1 times 1 is 1, which is odd. So, yes, the product of two odd numbers is always odd.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's look at the other possibilities:\n\n- Even times even: 2 times 4 is 8 (even).\n\n- Even times odd: 2 times 3 is 6 (even).\n\n- Odd times even: 3 times 4 is 12 (even).\n\n- Odd times odd: 3 times 5 is 15 (odd).\n\nSo, the only case where the product is odd is when both factors are odd. That aligns with option D.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: The product of 5 x 3 is odd because both of the factors are odd.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
