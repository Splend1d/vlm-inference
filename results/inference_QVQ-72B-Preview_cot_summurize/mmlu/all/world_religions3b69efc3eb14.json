                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which is the largest Muslim country in the world with more than 200 million adherents?\" And the options are A. Pakistan, B. Iraq, C. Indonesia, and D. Turkey. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these countries has the largest Muslim population, specifically more than 200 million.\n\nFirst off, I know that Islam is a major religion in many countries, especially in the Middle East and parts of Asia. But I'm not entirely sure which country has the most Muslims. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nStarting with Pakistan: I know Pakistan is a Muslim-majority country, and it's located in South Asia. It's a big country, but I'm not sure about its exact population or the number of Muslims there. Maybe I should look up some statistics to get a better idea.\n\nNext is Iraq. Iraq is also a Muslim-majority country, located in the Middle East. It's been through a lot of political and military conflicts, which might have affected its population. Again, I don't know the exact numbers, but it seems like a significant Muslim population, though probably not the largest.\n\nThen there's Indonesia. Indonesia is in Southeast Asia, and I recall that it's the world's most populous Muslim-majority country. In fact, I think Indonesia has more Muslims than any other country, including Middle Eastern nations. Let me confirm that. If that's the case, then maybe Indonesia is the answer.\n\nLastly, there's Turkey. Turkey is a transcontinental country, straddling Europe and Asia, and it's also a Muslim-majority country. It's quite populous, but again, I'm not sure about the exact number of Muslims there.\n\nMaybe I should consider the total population of each country and the percentage that is Muslim to estimate the number of Muslims in each.\n\nI remember that Pakistan has a population of around 220 million people, and the majority are Muslim. But I think Indonesia has a larger population overall. Let me see, according to some quick research I did before, Indonesia has a population of around 270 million people, and the majority are Muslim. So, that would suggest that Indonesia has more Muslims than Pakistan.\n\nIraq has a population of around 40 million, I believe, and the majority are Muslim. That would put it well below 200 million Muslims.\n\nTurkey has a population of around 80 million, and it's mostly Muslim. So, still less than 200 million.\n\nTherefore, based on these rough estimates, Indonesia seems to have the largest Muslim population among these options, with over 200 million Muslims.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other country not listed here that might have more Muslims than Indonesia? For example, India has a large Muslim minority. I think India has a significant number of Muslims, but India isn't one of the options here. So, I don't need to consider it for this question.\n\nSimilarly, Bangladesh is another Muslim-majority country in South Asia, but again, it's not among the options. Its population is around 160 million, so even if all of them were Muslim, which they're not, it still wouldn't reach 200 million.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, Indonesia appears to be the correct answer. It's the largest Muslim country in the world with more than 200 million adherents.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll look up some more recent data. According to the Pew Research Center, as of 2020, Indonesia had approximately 235 million Muslims, which is by far the largest Muslim population in any country. Pakistan comes next with around 220 million Muslims, followed by India with about 200 million, and then Bangladesh with around 160 million.\n\nSo, according to this data, Indonesia has the largest Muslim population, exceeding 200 million.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Indonesia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Indonesia}} \\]"
