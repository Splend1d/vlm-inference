He's the only psychologist in his town now, and the next closest mental health professional is over 100 miles away. That means people in his town really rely on him for help. Some of his new clients have problems that he doesn't have a lot of training or experience with. That must be tough for him, but it's also really important that he handles this responsibly.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. Refuse to see the clients.\n\nWell, that seems pretty extreme. If he refuses to see them, they might not have anywhere else to go for help, especially since the next professional is so far away. It might be difficult for them to travel that distance, especially if they're dealing with mental health issues. So, refusing seems like it could cause more harm than good.\n\nB. See these clients but use only interventions that he has experience using.\n\nHmm, this one makes some sense. He could stick to what he knows best and avoid techniques he's not familiar with. But what if the clients' issues require specific approaches that he doesn't have much experience with? Using general interventions might not be as effective for their particular problems. It's important to provide the best possible care, tailored to each client's needs.\n\nC. See the clients and obtain supervision or consultation by telephone.\n\nThis seems like a really good option. If he's not experienced with certain issues, getting guidance from more experienced professionals could help him provide better care. Telephone supervision or consultation is a practical solution, especially since there are no other psychologists nearby. He could consult with colleagues or supervisors who have expertise in the areas where he feels less confident.\n\nD. Agree to see these clients only if they are experiencing a crisis.\n\nThis seems limiting. Not everyone who needs a psychologist is in a crisis situation. If he only sees clients who are in crisis, that means a lot of people with ongoing issues might not get the help they need. Plus, it might not be fair to other clients who also need support but aren't in an emergency situation.\n\nLet me think about this again. The most important thing is to ensure that clients receive competent care. Dr. Smythe might not be an expert in every area, but with the right support and supervision, he can still provide valuable help to his clients.\n\nI think option C is the best choice. By seeking supervision or consultation, he can enhance his knowledge and skills while still being able to help his clients. It's a responsible way to bridge the gap in expertise and ensure that his clients get the best possible care.\n\nPlus, considering the geographical constraints, telephone supervision is a feasible option. It's a common practice in psychology and other professions where face-to-face contact isn't always possible.\n\nSo, my answer is C. See the clients and obtain supervision or consultation by telephone.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
