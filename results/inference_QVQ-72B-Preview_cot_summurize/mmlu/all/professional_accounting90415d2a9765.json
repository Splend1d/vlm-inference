                    "text": "So I've got this tax question here, and I need to figure out the child's basis for the securities when they sold them. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nThe parent gave securities to the child. The adjusted basis for the parent was $10,000, but the fair market value at the time of the gift was $9,000. Then, the child later sold those securities for $7,000. I need to find out what the child's basis was for the securities at the time of the sale.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how basis is determined when property is gifted. I think there are rules about taking the donor's basis or the fair market value, depending on certain conditions.\n\nLet me look this up. Oh, right. For gifted property, the recipient generally takes the donor's adjusted basis, but there are exceptions, especially if the fair market value at the time of the gift is different.\n\nWait, specifically, if the fair market value at the time of the gift is less than the donor's adjusted basis, which is the case here\u2014$9,000 FMV vs. $10,000 basis\u2014the recipient's basis is the fair market value at the time of the gift.\n\nIs that correct? Let me confirm. Yes, I think so. So, the child's basis would be the fair market value at the time of the gift, which is $9,000.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there any other factor that could affect the basis?\n\nWell, the child sold the securities for $7,000, which is less than both the parent's basis and the FMV at the time of the gift. Does that affect the basis? I don't think so. The sale price doesn't directly affect the basis; it's more about realizing a gain or loss.\n\nSo, if the child's basis is $9,000 and they sold it for $7,000, they have a $2,000 loss. That seems straightforward.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall something about the carryover basis rules for gifts. Let me double-check that.\n\nAccording to IRS Publication 525, Gift, Inheritance, and Inheritance Tax, the basis of property you get by gift is usually the same as it was in the hands of the person who gave it to you (the donor). However, if the fair market value of the property at the time of the gift was less than the donor's adjusted basis, then the basis for the recipient is the fair market value.\n\nSo, in this case, since $9,000 is less than the donor's basis of $10,000, the child's basis should indeed be $9,000.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there were any gift taxes paid that might affect the basis, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nAlso, has the child held the securities long enough for long-term capital gains treatment? But that might not matter for the basis calculation.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it. Maybe thinking about the holding period or any adjustments that might have occurred.\n\nNo, I don't think there are any adjustments mentioned in the scenario. It seems pretty straightforward.\n\nSo, the parent's adjusted basis is $10,000, fair market value at the time of the gift is $9,000, child sells for $7,000. Child's basis is $9,000, leading to a $2,000 loss on the sale.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. $9,000.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider why the other options might be wrong.\n\nOption A is $10,000, which is the parent's basis. But as we established, the child takes the fair market value as their basis when it's less than the donor's basis.\n\nOption C is $7,000, which is the sale price. But that's not the basis; that's the proceeds from the sale.\n\nOption D is $0, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. $9,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
