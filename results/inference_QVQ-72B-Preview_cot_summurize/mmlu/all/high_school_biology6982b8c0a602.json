                    "text": "So I've got this question about what happens to an animal cell when it's placed in freshwater, given that it's permeable to water but not to salts, and its internal NaCl concentration is 10%. The options are:\n\nA. plasmolyze\n\nB. swell and eventually lyse\n\nC. endocytose water into a large central vacuole\n\nD. shrivel\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic cell biology. Animal cells, unlike plant cells, don't have a cell wall. That's important because the cell wall provides structural support and prevents the cell from bursting when water flows in.\n\nNow, the cell is permeable to water but not to salts. That means water can cross the membrane through osmosis, but the salt particles (Na+ and Cl-) can't easily move out or in.\n\nThe internal NaCl concentration is 10%. In freshwater, the external NaCl concentration is effectively zero because freshwater doesn't have any significant salt content.\n\nSo, there's a concentration gradient here: high salt inside the cell and low salt outside.\n\nSince the cell is permeable to water but not to salts, the water will move toward the area of higher solute concentration, which is inside the cell.\n\nSo, water will flow into the cell via osmosis, trying to dilute the high salt concentration inside.\n\nBut, because the cell can't get rid of the salt easily, and it's in an environment with no salt, the water will keep flowing in to try to equalize the salt concentration.\n\nIn animal cells, this can lead to swelling as the cell takes on more water.\n\nIf too much water enters, the cell can burst, or lyse.\n\nSo, based on this, option B seems plausible: swell and eventually lyse.\n\nLet's check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: plasmolyze. This is a process where plant cells lose water and the cell membrane pulls away from the cell wall. Animal cells don't have a cell wall, so they can't plasmolyze. So, this is unlikely.\n\nOption C: endocytose water into a large central vacuole. Animal cells typically don't have large central vacuoles like plant cells do. While some animal cells can sequester fluids into vesicles, it's not the primary response to osmotic pressure in freshwater.\n\nOption D: shrivel. Shriveling would imply that the cell is losing water, which would happen if it were in a hypertonic solution (higher solute concentration outside), but in this case, it's in freshwater, which is hypotonic (lower solute concentration outside), so water should be flowing in, not out.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B: swell and eventually lyse.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if there's any mechanism in animal cells that could prevent this swelling and lysis in freshwater.\n\nSome animal cells, especially those found in freshwater environments, have adaptations to manage osmotic pressure, like pumps to expel excess water or to manage ion concentrations.\n\nHowever, the question seems to suggest that the cell can't regulate the salt movement effectively, as it's permeable to water but not salts.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion remains that the cell will swell and eventually lyse due to the osmotic influx of water.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
