                    "text": "So I have this problem here: I need to find the H+ concentration in a 1.0 M phenol solution. The Ka for phenol is 1 \u00d7 10^-10. The options are A. 1 \u00d7 10^-10 M, B. 1 \u00d7 10^-9 M, C. 1 \u00d7 10^-3 M, and D. 1 \u00d7 10^-5 M.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Ka represents. Ka is the acid dissociation constant, which measures the strength of an acid in solution. The smaller the Ka value, the weaker the acid. Phenol is a weak acid, as indicated by its Ka of 1 \u00d7 10^-10.\n\nThe dissociation of phenol in water can be represented by the equation:\n\nC6H5OH \u21cc C6H5O- + H+\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression for this dissociation is:\n\nKa = [C6H5O-][H+] / [C6H5OH]\n\nGiven that Ka is very small, I can assume that the dissociation is minimal, so the concentration of undissociated phenol remains approximately equal to the initial concentration, which is 1.0 M.\n\nLet x be the concentration of H+ ions produced at equilibrium. Then, the concentrations at equilibrium would be:\n\n[C6H5OH] = 1.0 - x \u2248 1.0 M\n\n[C6H5O-] = x M\n\n[H+] = x M\n\nPlugging these into the Ka expression:\n\n1 \u00d7 10^-10 = (x)(x) / (1.0)\n\nSo, x^2 = 1 \u00d7 10^-10\n\nTherefore, x = \u221a(1 \u00d7 10^-10) = 1 \u00d7 10^-5 M\n\nWait a minute, that would be option D. But I need to check if the approximation holds.\n\nTo verify the approximation, I should check if x is less than about 5% of the initial concentration of phenol.\n\nx / [C6H5OH]initial = 1 \u00d7 10^-5 / 1.0 = 1 \u00d7 10^-5, which is indeed much less than 0.05 (5%), so the approximation is valid.\n\nTherefore, the H+ concentration is approximately 1 \u00d7 10^-5 M, which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut wait, I recall that in weak acid dissociations, sometimes we need to consider the autoionization of water, which can contribute to the H+ concentration, especially in very dilute solutions or with very weak acids.\n\nIn this case, the Ka is 1 \u00d7 10^-10, which is quite small, indicating a very weak acid. At 1.0 M concentration, the acid is relatively concentrated, so perhaps the contribution from water autoionization is negligible compared to the acid dissociation.\n\nLet me calculate the H+ concentration from water autoionization.\n\nThe ion product of water (Kw) is 1 \u00d7 10^-14 at 25\u00b0C.\n\nIn pure water, [H+] = [OH-] = 1 \u00d7 10^-7 M.\n\nIn a phenol solution, the acid donates H+ ions, which will suppress the autoionization of water via Le Chatelier's principle.\n\nThe extent of suppression depends on the concentration of H+ from the acid dissociation.\n\nGiven that [H+] from phenol dissociation is 1 \u00d7 10^-5 M, which is 100 times higher than the [H+] from water autoionization (1 \u00d7 10^-7 M), the contribution from water autoionization is negligible in this case.\n\nTherefore, the total [H+] is approximately equal to the [H+] from phenol dissociation, which is 1 \u00d7 10^-5 M.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 1 \u00d7 10^-5 M.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nGiven:\n\nKa = 1 \u00d7 10^-10\n\nInitial concentration of phenol = 1.0 M\n\nLet x = [H+] = [C6H5O-]\n\nThen, Ka = x^2 / (1.0 - x) \u2248 x^2 / 1.0\n\nSo, x^2 = 1 \u00d7 10^-10\n\nThus, x = 1 \u00d7 10^-5 M\n\nCheck if x is less than 5% of 1.0 M:\n\n1 \u00d7 10^-5 < 0.05 \u2192 yes, so the approximation is valid.\n\nTherefore, [H+] = 1 \u00d7 10^-5 M\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 1 \u00d7 10^-5 M\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 1 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{M}} \\]"
