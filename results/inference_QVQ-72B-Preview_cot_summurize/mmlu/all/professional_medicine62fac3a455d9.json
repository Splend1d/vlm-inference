                    "text": "So I've got this case about a 7-month-old baby who was recently in the hospital for enteritis and dehydration, and now has persistent watery diarrhea. The mom is feeding him cow's milk formula and some strained fruits and vegetables. On exam, his temperature is a bit low at 37.4\u00b0C, mucous membranes are dry, and his abdomen is a bit distended. Nothing else seems wrong. The question is asking what's most likely causing this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what enteritis is. Enteritis is inflammation of the small intestine, which can lead to diarrhea and sometimes vomiting. Dehydration is a common complication because of the fluid loss from diarrhea. The baby was hospitalized for this, treated, and then discharged, but now has persistent watery diarrhea.\n\nThe baby is being fed cow's milk formula and strained fruits and vegetables. Cow's milk can sometimes cause issues in infants, especially those with lactose intolerance or cow's milk protein allergy. But the question mentions that the mother feeds him cow's milk formula, which is pretty standard for infants who aren't breastfed.\n\nNow, the physical exam shows a temperature of 37.4\u00b0C, which is slightly below normal for an infant (normal can be around 36.5-37.5\u00b0C). Mucous membranes are dry, which could indicate dehydration. The abdomen is slightly distended, which can happen with diarrhea due to intestinal gas and fluid accumulation.\n\nNo other abnormalities are seen, which is good, meaning there are no signs of severe infection or other serious issues.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Fructose intolerance\n\nB. Transient lactase deficiency\n\nC. Magnesium deficiency\n\nD. Regional enteritis\n\nLet's consider each one.\n\nFructose intolerance is a rare genetic disorder where the body can't metabolize fructose properly. Fructose is found in many fruits and some carbohydrates. Symptoms can include diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain after consuming fructose-containing foods. However, it's usually present from birth, and not something that would develop after an episode of enteritis. So, maybe not the most likely cause here.\n\nTransient lactase deficiency: Lactase is the enzyme that breaks down lactose, the sugar in milk. Sometimes after an episode of gastrointestinal infection, especially viral gastroenteritis, the lining of the small intestine can be damaged, leading to a temporary lactase deficiency. This can cause lactose intolerance, leading to diarrhea when the baby consumes milk products. Given that the baby was recently hospitalized for enteritis, this seems like a plausible option.\n\nMagnesium deficiency: Magnesium is an essential mineral, and deficiency can cause various symptoms, including gastrointestinal issues. However, magnesium deficiency is uncommon in infants unless there's a specific reason for malabsorption or inadequate intake. Since the baby is being fed formula and some solids, it's unlikely that magnesium deficiency is the primary cause of the diarrhea, especially since the diarrhea started after an episode of enteritis.\n\nRegional enteritis: This is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), specifically affecting the terminal ileum and sometimes the colon. Symptoms can include diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and sometimes fever. However, regional enteritis is typically a chronic condition, and it's unusual for it to present acutely after an episode of enteritis, especially in a 7-month-old infant.\n\nGiven the history of recent enteritis and dehydration, followed by persistent watery diarrhea, transient lactase deficiency seems like the most likely explanation. The damage to the intestinal lining during the enteritis could have caused a temporary drop in lactase production, leading to lactose intolerance and diarrhea when the baby consumes milk products.\n\nTo confirm this, perhaps the doctor would test for lactose intolerance by doing a lactose tolerance test or a hydrogen breath test. Eliminating lactose from the diet temporarily might also help to see if the diarrhea improves.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. Transient lactase deficiency.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
