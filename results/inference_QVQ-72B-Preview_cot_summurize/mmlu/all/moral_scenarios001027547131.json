                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about two different scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. In Scenario 1, the main character wants to enliven a zoo fundraiser. So, they let in the food servers and allow them to swarm the dining hall quickly. In Scenario 2, the main character offers to watch as their pregnant wife takes out the heavy trash. Okay, so both scenarios involve some action by the main character that might be evaluated morally.\n\nLet me think about Scenario 1 first. The person is trying to make the zoo fundraiser more lively by letting in food servers and having them swarm the dining hall quickly. I need to consider if this action is morally wrong. Well, intentions matter in morality, right? The intention here seems to be positive\u2014they want to make the event more lively and successful. But maybe there are some unintended consequences or rules being broken.\n\nWait a minute, is there any rule or regulation at the zoo fundraiser that says food servers shouldn't be let in quickly or shouldn't swarm the dining hall? Maybe there's a protocol for how food servers should enter the dining area to ensure safety or orderliness. If the main character is bypassing that protocol, perhaps that could be considered wrong.\n\nBut, on the other hand, if the goal is to make the event more lively and the action achieves that without causing harm, is it really wrong? I think it depends on the context. Maybe I need to think about whether this action could potentially harm anyone or break important rules.\n\nLet me consider possible harms. If the food servers are swarming the dining hall quickly, maybe there's a risk of tripping or dropping food, which could be messy or even dangerous if hot food is involved. But is that enough to consider the action morally wrong? Hmm.\n\nPerhaps it's more of a matter of poor planning or lack of organization rather than a moral wrong. Unless there's a specific rule being broken or someone is being put in danger intentionally, I'm not sure if it rises to the level of being morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2. Here, the main character is offering to watch as their pregnant wife takes out the heavy trash. So, the action is offering to\u76d1\u7763 or observe while she does this task. Now, pregnant women are advised to avoid heavy lifting because it can be risky for the pregnancy. So, asking a pregnant woman to take out heavy trash seems like a bad idea.\n\nBut wait, the person is offering to watch as she does it. Maybe they're planning to\u76d1\u7763to make sure she doesn't hurt herself. But even then, if heavy lifting is unsafe for her, just watching might not be enough to prevent potential harm.\n\nIn this case, it seems like the main character is putting their pregnant wife in a potentially harmful situation by having her take out heavy trash. Even if they're watching, it might not be sufficient to ensure her safety.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, in Scenario 1, the action might be somewhat reckless but isn't clearly morally wrong unless it causes significant harm, while in Scenario 2, involving a pregnant woman in heavy lifting is generally considered unsafe and thus morally questionable.\n\nBut I need to choose among the options: A. Wrong, Wrong; B. Wrong, Not wrong; C. Not wrong, Wrong; D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBased on my thinking, Scenario 1 might not be clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 seems more clearly wrong due to the potential harm to the pregnant wife.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, letting food servers into the dining hall quickly could be seen as disruptive or against rules, but is it morally wrong? Maybe it's just a poor decision in terms of event management, but not necessarily a moral failing.\n\nIn Scenario 2, having a pregnant woman take out heavy trash is likely to be seen as morally wrong because it puts her health at risk, which is something we have a moral obligation to avoid, especially given her vulnerable state.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
