                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I took both of my kids by their hands and ran away from the burning house.\" Okay, so there's a fire in the house, and the person grabs their kids and runs to safety. That seems like a pretty straightforward case of protecting one's children in an emergency situation. Running away from a burning building is generally considered the right thing to do, right? It's about ensuring everyone's safety. So, in this scenario, I don't see anything morally wrong with what the person did. In fact, it seems like the responsible and morally correct action.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"In order to impress Taylor Swift, I tried to learn how to write songs.\" Hmm, this is interesting. So, the person is motivated to learn songwriting to impress a celebrity, specifically Taylor Swift. Now, learning a new skill like songwriting is generally a positive thing. It's about personal growth and developing creativity. The intention might be to impress someone famous, but is that morally wrong? Well, it depends on how far someone takes it, but just trying to learn a skill to impress someone doesn't seem inherently immoral. It might be a bit naive or idealistic, but it's not necessarily harmful or unethical.\n\nSo, based on these two scenarios, it seems like neither of them involves doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In Scenario 1, running away from a burning house with your kids is the right thing to do. In Scenario 2, trying to learn songwriting to impress Taylor Swift is more about personal development and perhaps pursuing a dream, even if it's rooted in admiration or infatuation with a celebrity.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe there are some underlying intentions or consequences in these scenarios that could be considered morally questionable. Let me think deeper.\n\nIn Scenario 1, taking your kids and running from a burning house seems unequivocally right. It's about saving lives, which is a fundamental moral imperative. There doesn't seem to be any room for interpreting this action as wrong, unless there were other factors involved, like leaving someone else behind or something, but the scenario doesn't mention that.\n\nIn Scenario 2, learning songwriting to impress Taylor Swift might be driven by admiration or a desire for recognition, which are human motivations that aren't inherently bad. However, if the person was, say, stalking Taylor Swift or had malicious intentions beyond just learning the skill, that would change things. But the scenario only says they tried to learn how to write songs to impress her, which seems harmless enough.\n\nSo, yeah, based on the information provided, I still think both actions are \"Not wrong.\"\n\nBut let's consider if there's any possible way Scenario 2 could be interpreted as morally wrong. Maybe if learning songwriting involved unethical practices, like plagiarizing others' work or harming someone else in the process. But again, the scenario doesn't specify any of that; it just says they tried to learn how to write songs.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait, but the question says \"according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\" Is there anything specific about that time and place that might affect these judgments? Well, in 2020, emphasizing life safety and protecting children in dangerous situations is still a top priority, so Scenario 1 remains clearly the right thing to do. As for Scenario 2, pursuing personal interests or skills for the sake of impressing someone, even a celebrity, doesn't seem to violate any moral standards in the US in 2020.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nJust to make sure, let's look back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven that neither scenario appears to involve morally wrong actions based on ordinary US standards in 2020, the correct choice is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
