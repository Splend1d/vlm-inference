                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out these statements about group theory, specifically about elements of order 15 in a group. I need to determine whether these statements are true or false.\n\nFirst, let's recall some basic concepts. In group theory, the order of an element \\( g \\) in a group \\( G \\) is the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( g^n = e \\), where \\( e \\) is the identity element of the group. Also, an important theorem here is Lagrange's Theorem, which states that the order of any subgroup \\( H \\) of \\( G \\) divides the order of \\( G \\), i.e., \\( |H| \\) divides \\( |G| \\).\n\nNow, let's look at Statement 1: \"If a group has an element of order 15, it must have at least 8 elements of order 15.\"\n\nSo, if there's an element of order 15, that means there's a subgroup generated by this element, which is cyclic, and its order is 15. By Lagrange's Theorem, the possible orders of elements in this subgroup must divide 15. The divisors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15.\n\nSpecifically, in a cyclic group of order 15, there is:\n\n- Exactly one subgroup of order 1, which is just the identity element.\n\n- Exactly one subgroup of order 3.\n\n- Exactly one subgroup of order 5.\n\n- Exactly one subgroup of order 15.\n\nNow, the elements of order 15 are precisely those that generate the entire group, i.e., the cyclic group of order 15.\n\nHow many elements of order 15 are there in a cyclic group of order 15?\n\nIn a cyclic group of order \\( n \\), the number of generators is \\( \\phi(n) \\), where \\( \\phi \\) is Euler's totient function, which counts the number of integers from 1 to \\( n \\) that are coprime with \\( n \\).\n\nSo, for \\( n = 15 \\), \\( \\phi(15) = \\phi(3 \\times 5) = (3-1)(5-1) = 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\).\n\nTherefore, there are exactly 8 elements of order 15 in any cyclic group of order 15.\n\nBut the statement says, \"if a group has an element of order 15, it must have at least 8 elements of order 15.\"\n\nWait a minute, does this mean any group with an element of order 15 must have at least 8 elements of order 15? Not necessarily.\n\nBecause, in a cyclic group of order 15, there are exactly 8 elements of order 15. But what if the group is not cyclic?\n\nLet's consider a group that is not cyclic. Suppose \\( G \\) is a group that contains an element of order 15, but is not cyclic of order 15.\n\nFor example, consider the direct product of two cyclic groups, say \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\). The order of this group is \\( 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\), but it's not cyclic.\n\nDoes this group have any elements of order 15?\n\nIn \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), the order of an element \\( (a, b) \\) is the least common multiple of the orders of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Since 3 and 5 are coprime, the order of any element in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\) is the product of its orders in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) and \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\).\n\nTherefore, to have an element of order 15, we need an element where the first component has order 3 and the second has order 5, or vice versa.\n\nBut in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), the non-identity elements have order 3, and in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), the non-identity elements have order 5.\n\nSo, in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), elements of the form \\( (a, b) \\) where \\( a \\) has order 3 and \\( b \\) has order 5 will have order 15.\n\nHow many such elements are there?\n\nIn \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), there are 2 elements of order 3 (since it's cyclic of order 3).\n\nIn \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), there are 4 elements of order 5.\n\nSimilarly, there are elements where \\( a \\) has order 1 and \\( b \\) has order 5, but their order would be 5, not 15.\n\nSo, the number of elements of order 15 is \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\), same as in the cyclic group of order 15.\n\nWait, so in this case, it's also 8.\n\nBut is this always the case, or can there be fewer elements of order 15 in a group that has an element of order 15?\n\nLet me think about another example.\n\nSuppose we have a group of order 15 that is not cyclic. Is there such a group?\n\nActually, it turns out that any group of order \\( pq \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes with \\( p < q \\) and \\( p \\) does not divide \\( q - 1 \\), is cyclic.\n\nIn this case, \\( p = 3 \\), \\( q = 5 \\), and 3 does not divide \\( 4 \\), so any group of order 15 is cyclic.\n\nWait, but earlier I considered \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), which is indeed cyclic since 3 and 5 are coprime.\n\nSo, actually, any group of order 15 is cyclic, by the above criterion.\n\nTherefore, in any group of order 15 that has an element of order 15, there are exactly 8 elements of order 15.\n\nBut what if the group is larger than 15 elements?\n\nThe statement says, \"if a group has an element of order 15, it must have at least 8 elements of order 15.\"\n\nWell, if the group is of order 15, it's cyclic, and it has exactly 8 elements of order 15.\n\nIf the group is larger than 15, could it have fewer than 8 elements of order 15?\n\nLet's consider a group of order 30.\n\nIn \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{30} \\), which is cyclic of order 30, the number of elements of order 15 is \\( \\phi(15) = 8 \\), same as before.\n\nBut could there be a group of order 30 that is not cyclic and has fewer than 8 elements of order 15?\n\nLet's see.\n\nThe group \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{15} \\) has order 30.\n\nDoes this group have elements of order 15?\n\nIn \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{15} \\), the order of an element \\( (a, b) \\) is the lcm of the orders of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nSince 2 and 15 are coprime, the lcm is the product, so an element \\( (a, b) \\) has order 30 if \\( a \\) has order 2 and \\( b \\) has order 15.\n\nSimilarly, if \\( a \\) has order 1 and \\( b \\) has order 15, then the element has order 15.\n\nSo, how many elements of order 15 are there in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{15} \\)?\n\nIn \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\), there are 1 element of order 1 and 1 element of order 2.\n\nIn \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{15} \\), there are \\( \\phi(15) = 8 \\) elements of order 15.\n\nSo, the number of elements where the first component has order 1 and the second has order 15 is \\( 1 \\times 8 = 8 \\).\n\nSimilarly, if the first component has order 2 and the second has order 15, the element has order 30.\n\nSo, again, there are exactly 8 elements of order 15 in this group.\n\nWhat if we consider a different group of order 30, say the dihedral group \\( D_{15} \\), which has order 30.\n\nDoes \\( D_{15} \\) have elements of order 15?\n\nIn \\( D_{15} \\), the rotations form a cyclic subgroup of order 15, and the reflections have order 2.\n\nSo, in the rotation subgroup, there are \\( \\phi(15) = 8 \\) elements of order 15.\n\nAdditionally, the reflections combined with rotations can potentially have different orders, but in \\( D_{15} \\), the elements outside the rotation subgroup have orders that are divisors of the order of the group.\n\nBut specifically, in \\( D_{15} \\), the elements of order 15 are precisely the rotations of order 15.\n\nSo, again, there are 8 elements of order 15 in \\( D_{15} \\).\n\nWait, but is that accurate?\n\nLet me recall that in \\( D_{n} \\), the dihedral group of order \\( 2n \\), the elements of order \\( n \\) are the rotations of order \\( n \\), which form a cyclic subgroup of order \\( n \\).\n\nSo, in \\( D_{15} \\), the rotations form a cyclic subgroup of order 15, and within this subgroup, there are \\( \\phi(15) = 8 \\) elements of order 15.\n\nThe reflections have order 2 and, when combined with rotations, produce elements of order 2 or some other orders, but not order 15, because the product of a reflection and a rotation is not a rotation unless the rotation is the identity.\n\nWait, actually, in dihedral groups, the elements of order \\( n \\) are only the rotations of order \\( n \\).\n\nSo, in \\( D_{15} \\), there are exactly 8 elements of order 15, same as in the cyclic group of order 15.\n\nHmm, so in all these examples, whether the group is cyclic or dihedral, there are exactly 8 elements of order 15.\n\nBut is there a group where there are fewer than 8 elements of order 15?\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose we have a group \\( G \\) that contains an element of order 15.\n\nLet \\( H \\) be the subgroup generated by this element, so \\( H \\) is cyclic of order 15.\n\nIn \\( H \\), there are exactly 8 elements of order 15.\n\nNow, in \\( G \\), there could be other elements of order 15, but could there be fewer than 8?\n\nWell, if \\( G = H \\), then there are exactly 8 elements of order 15.\n\nIf \\( G \\) is larger than \\( H \\), could there be elements outside \\( H \\) that have order 15?\n\nLet's consider that.\n\nSuppose \\( g \\) is an element in \\( G \\) but not in \\( H \\), and suppose \\( g \\) has order 15.\n\nThen, the subgroup generated by \\( g \\), \\( \\langle g \\rangle \\), is a cyclic subgroup of order 15.\n\nBy Lagrange's Theorem, the order of \\( \\langle g \\rangle \\) must divide the order of \\( G \\).\n\nSo, if \\( G \\) has order divisible by 15, then this is possible.\n\nBut what about the number of elements of order 15 in \\( G \\)?\n\nWell, in \\( H \\), there are 8 elements of order 15.\n\nIf there are other subgroups isomorphic to \\( H \\) in \\( G \\), each such subgroup would also have 8 elements of order 15, but these elements might overlap with those in \\( H \\), or not.\n\nWait, but in a group, different cyclic subgroups of order 15 may share elements of order 15.\n\nFor example, in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{15} \\), the elements of order 15 are only those where the first component is the identity, so they don't overlap with any other subgroups of order 15.\n\nWait, no, in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{15} \\), the elements of order 15 are precisely those where the first component is the identity and the second component has order 15.\n\nSimilarly, in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{15} \\), there is only one subgroup of order 15, which is \\( \\{0\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{15} \\), and it has exactly 8 elements of order 15.\n\nSo, in this case, there are no other subgroups of order 15.\n\nSimilarly, in \\( D_{15} \\), there is only one cyclic subgroup of order 15, the rotation subgroup.\n\nSo, in these examples, there are exactly 8 elements of order 15.\n\nBut could there be a group where there are fewer than 8 elements of order 15?\n\nWait a second, perhaps in a non-abelian group, elements of order 15 could be fewer.\n\nLet me consider a semi-direct product or some other non-abelian group of order 15, but as we saw earlier, any group of order 15 is cyclic.\n\nWait, but for larger groups, could there be fewer than 8 elements of order 15?\n\nLet me consider \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\), which has order 30.\n\nIn this group, the elements of order 15 would be those where the first component has order 3, the second has order 5, and the third has order 1.\n\nSo, the number of such elements is \\( 2 \\times 4 \\times 1 = 8 \\), same as before.\n\nAlternatively, consider \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{15} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_1 \\), which is just \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{15} \\), and again, 8 elements of order 15.\n\nIt seems like in all these cases, there are exactly 8 elements of order 15.\n\nIs there a general reason for this?\n\nWell, in a cyclic group of order 15, there are exactly 8 elements of order 15.\n\nIn a direct product of cyclic groups, the number of elements of order 15 is determined by the components' orders, and it still comes out to be 8.\n\nIs there a group where this number is less than 8?\n\nWait, perhaps if the group is not a direct product.\n\nLet's consider a group where there is only one subgroup of order 15, and it has exactly 8 elements of order 15.\n\nIs it possible to have a group where there are fewer than 8 elements of order 15?\n\nI'm starting to think that it's not possible, at least not in groups of order divisible by 15.\n\nBecause any element of order 15 generates a cyclic subgroup of order 15, which has exactly 8 elements of order 15.\n\nAnd in a larger group containing this subgroup, there might be more elements of order 15, but not fewer.\n\nTherefore, it seems that any group containing an element of order 15 must have at least 8 elements of order 15.\n\nHence, Statement 1 is true.\n\nNow, let's look at Statement 2: \"If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15.\"\n\nSo, if a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, does it necessarily have at least 16 elements of order 15?\n\nIn other words, is the number of elements of order 15 in a group either exactly 8 or at least 16?\n\nFrom the examples I've considered so far, the number of elements of order 15 is exactly 8.\n\nBut could there be a group with more than 8 elements of order 15?\n\nLet's see.\n\nSuppose we have a group that contains multiple subgroups isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{15} \\), each contributing 8 elements of order 15.\n\nBut in a group, different cyclic subgroups of order 15 may share some elements of order 15.\n\nFor example, in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), there is only one subgroup of order 15, so only 8 elements of order 15.\n\nIn \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), which has order 30, the elements of order 15 would be those where the first component has order 1 (identity), the second has order 3, and the third has order 5.\n\nSo, number of such elements is \\( 1 \\times 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\), same as before.\n\nWhat if we consider a group of order 45, say \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\).\n\nIn this group, the elements of order 15 would be those where the first two components have orders that multiply to 3, and the third has order 5.\n\nWait, more precisely, for an element \\( (a, b, c) \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), its order is the lcm of the orders of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nSince 3, 3, and 5 are pairwise coprime except that 3 and 3 share a common factor, we need to consider the orders carefully.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), the elements of order 15 would"
