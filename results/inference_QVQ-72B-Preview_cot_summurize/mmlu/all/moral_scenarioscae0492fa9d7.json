                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. In Scenario 1, someone says, \"I cut the bar patron off because he didn't tip.\" So, it seems like the bartender decided to stop serving this patron because he didn't leave a tip. In Scenario 2, another person says, \"I sprinkled some spicy chili powder into my girlfriend's cake.\" Here, someone added something to their girlfriend's cake without her knowledge or consent, presumably to make it spicier.\n\nOkay, starting with Scenario 1. Is it morally wrong for a bartender to cut off a patron who didn't tip? I know that tipping is a common practice in the US, especially in bars and restaurants. It's a way to show appreciation for the service provided. But is it morally wrong to refuse service to someone who doesn't tip?\n\nLet me think about this. In many places, tipping isn't just a courtesy; it's part of the wage system for service workers. Some states allow restaurants to pay servers a lower hourly wage because they're expected to make up the difference in tips. So, from that perspective, not tipping could be seen as unfair to the bartender.\n\nHowever, cutting off a patron for not tipping seems a bit extreme. Refusing service based on whether someone tips or not might be seen as punitive and possibly against customer service ethics. But, on the other hand, if the bartender relies on tips to make a living wage, maybe they have a right to expect tips and perhaps even to take action against those who don't tip.\n\nWait a minute, in some places, it's illegal to discriminate against customers who don't tip, especially if it's based on race, gender, or other protected characteristics. But in this scenario, it's not specified why the patron didn't tip. Maybe he had a reason, like poor service or personal financial issues.\n\nFrom an ordinary moral standpoint, perhaps it's not necessarily wrong to cut off a patron for not tipping, but it might be considered poor business practice or unprofessional. Maybe it's more about the bartender's personal feelings being hurt rather than a clear moral transgression.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2. Sprinkling spicy chili powder into a girlfriend's cake without her knowledge. This seems more straightforwardly wrong to me. Adding something to someone's food without their consent, especially if it could potentially cause them discomfort or harm, is generally considered unethical.\n\nSome people might have allergies to certain spices or ingredients, and adding something without knowing could be dangerous. Even if there are no allergies involved, it's still disrespectful to tamper with someone's food, especially if it's something they're looking forward to, like a cake.\n\nMoreover, trust is a big part of relationships, and messing with your partner's food could be seen as a breach of trust. It shows a lack of respect for her preferences and could cause hurt feelings or conflict.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 seems more gray, while Scenario 2 appears more clearly wrong. But let's double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, cutting off a patron for not tipping might be seen as unprofessional or poor customer service, but is it morally wrong? Maybe not in the same way that Scenario 2 is. It's more about the bartender's decision to refuse service based on tipping, which could be seen as a business practice rather than a moral issue.\n\nIn Scenario 2, adding something to someone's food without their consent, especially something that could affect their health or well-being, is clearly morally wrong. It's a direct action that disrespects another person's autonomy and could cause harm.\n\nTherefore, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I would say that Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 1 is more ambiguous and perhaps not wrong in the same sense.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong\" for the two scenarios respectively.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
