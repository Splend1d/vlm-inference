                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out what's going to happen in this situation involving a car accident. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are two people in a car, the driver and the passenger. They're driving to work at 20 miles per hour, which is within the speed limit. So, they're not speeding or anything like that. As they're driving, the passenger points out an overturned car on the side of the highway and says, \"Look at that car upside down.\" The driver turns to look at the overturned vehicle. While he's looking sideways, he doesn't see that there's an abandoned car with a flat tire in the highway about 200 feet ahead. A few seconds later, the driver crashes into the back of this abandoned car and gets injured.\n\nNow, the jurisdiction has a comparative negligence statute in place. That means that when there's an accident, the court looks at how much each party was at fault and assigns percentages of blame accordingly. So, the damages that the plaintiff can recover are reduced by their own percentage of fault.\n\nThe question is, if the driver sues the owner of the abandoned car, what's the most likely result?\n\nOption A says the driver will recover all of his damages because the defendant created a dangerous condition.\n\nOption B says the driver will recover only a portion of damages because the abandoned auto was in plain view.\n\nOption C says the driver will recover nothing because he had the last clear chance to avoid the collision.\n\nOption D says the driver will recover nothing because the passenger's act was a supervening cause.\n\nAlright, let's analyze these one by one.\n\nFirst, Option A: recover all damages because the defendant created a dangerous condition.\n\nWell, the abandoned car with a flat tire is indeed a dangerous condition on the highway. But the driver was looking away from the road when the accident happened. So, even if the defendant created a dangerous condition, the driver might also be at fault for not paying attention to the road. Comparative negligence considers both parties' faults, so maybe the driver isn't entirely without blame.\n\nOption B: recover only a portion of damages because the abandoned auto was in plain view.\n\nSo, the abandoned car was visible, but the driver wasn't looking directly ahead at that moment. Does the fact that it was in plain view affect the driver's ability to recover damages? Maybe it suggests that the driver should have seen it if he was paying attention, but since he wasn't, does that mean he's partly at fault? That seems plausible.\n\nOption C: recover nothing because he had the last clear chance to avoid the collision.\n\nThe last clear chance doctrine is about whether one party had the opportunity to avoid the accident when the other party was already negligent. In this case, the driver was looking away, so maybe he didn't have the last clear chance. Alternatively, perhaps the owner of the abandoned car had the last clear chance to remove it or warn others. But I'm not sure about this one.\n\nOption D: recover nothing because the passenger's act was a supervening cause.\n\nA supervening cause is something that happens after the initial negligent act and breaks the chain of causation, meaning it's an independent event that causes the harm. Here, the passenger pointing out the overturned car caused the driver to look away, which led to the accident. Is this a supervening cause? It seems like it's part of the sequence of events leading up to the accident, but I'm not sure if it's independent enough to break the chain of causation.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider the duties and breaches of each party.\n\nFirst, the owner of the abandoned car had a duty to not leave their vehicle in a way that creates a hazard on the highway. By leaving it there with a flat tire, they likely breached that duty, creating a dangerous situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the driver had a duty to operate their vehicle safely and pay attention to the road. By turning to look at the overturned car and not seeing the abandoned car ahead, the driver may also have breached their duty of care.\n\nSo, both parties seem to have been negligent to some degree.\n\nUnder comparative negligence, their damages would be apportioned based on their respective degrees of fault.\n\nSo, if the court finds that the driver was, say, 40% at fault and the owner of the abandoned car was 60% at fault, the driver would recover 60% of their damages.\n\nBut the options are:\n\nA: all damages\n\nB: a portion\n\nC: nothing\n\nD: nothing\n\nSo, if comparative negligence applies, and both parties are at fault, the driver would likely recover a portion of his damages, not all of them, and certainly not nothing unless his fault outweighs the defendant's fault entirely.\n\nWait, but I don't know the specific percentages here. Maybe in this jurisdiction, if the plaintiff is more at fault than the defendant, they can't recover anything. But the question says \"comparative negligence statute in effect,\" which typically allows recovery even if the plaintiff is at some fault, as long as the defendant is also at fault.\n\nBut I need to check if this jurisdiction follows a modified comparative negligence rule, where if the plaintiff is 50% or more at fault, they can't recover, or if it's pure comparative negligence, where the plaintiff can recover as long as they're not 100% at fault.\n\nI don't have that information, but since the problem mentions a \"comparative negligence statute,\" I'll assume it's pure comparative negligence unless told otherwise.\n\nSo, in that case, the driver would recover a portion of his damages, depending on his degree of fault.\n\nBut looking back at the options, Option B says recover only a portion of damages because the abandoned auto was in plain view.\n\nIs that the reason why he would recover only a portion? Because the abandoned car was in plain view?\n\nWell, the plain view might suggest that the driver should have seen it if he was paying attention, which he wasn't. So, perhaps that's why his recovery would be reduced.\n\nBut is that the only reason? Maybe.\n\nOption A says he recovers all damages because the defendant created a dangerous condition. But as I thought earlier, even if the defendant created a dangerous condition, the driver's inattention might mean he's also at fault, so he shouldn't recover all of his damages.\n\nOption C says he recovers nothing because he had the last clear chance to avoid the collision. But I'm not sure about that. Did the driver have the last clear chance? He was looking away, so maybe not. Maybe the owner of the abandoned car had the last clear chance to remove it or warn others. But I don't know.\n\nOption D says he recovers nothing because the passenger's act was a supervening cause. But again, the passenger's act of pointing out the overturned car was part of the sequence of events, but was it an independent act that broke the chain of causation? Probably not, because it was a natural reaction and part of the flow of events leading to the accident.\n\nSo, maybe Option B is the correct answer: he recovers only a portion of his damages because the abandoned auto was in plain view, implying that he should have seen it if he was paying attention, and therefore his inattention contributes to his fault.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure. Maybe I need to think about it differently.\n\nLet me consider the concept of contributory negligence versus comparative negligence.\n\nContributory negligence is where if the plaintiff is at all negligent, they can't recover anything. But comparative negligence apportions the fault between the parties.\n\nIn this case, since the jurisdiction has a comparative negligence statute, it's not contributory negligence.\n\nSo, even if the driver was negligent, as long as the defendant was also negligent, the driver can recover, but his recovery is reduced by his own percentage of fault.\n\nSo, if the driver is, say, 40% at fault, and the defendant is 60% at fault, the driver would recover 60% of his damages.\n\nTherefore, he would recover a portion of his damages.\n\nSo, Option B seems to align with that.\n\nBut the reasoning in Option B is \"because the abandoned auto was in plain view.\"\n\nIs that the right reasoning?\n\nWell, the plain view might be relevant to determining the driver's fault. If the obstacle was in plain view, the driver should have seen it if he was paying attention, which he wasn't. So, his inattention contributes to his fault, which would reduce his recovery under comparative negligence.\n\nSo, perhaps the plain view is relevant to the driver's fault, not the defendant's fault.\n\nWait, but the defendant's car was abandoned and had a flat tire, which is a dangerous condition, and the defendant is likely at fault for leaving it there.\n\nSo, both parties are at fault: the defendant for leaving the car there, and the driver for not paying attention.\n\nUnder comparative negligence, their faults are compared, and the driver's recovery is reduced by his own percentage of fault.\n\nSo, he would likely recover only a portion of his damages.\n\nTherefore, Option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the driver is not entirely without fault.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the driver didn't have the last clear chance to avoid the collision; he was looking away.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the passenger's act was part of the sequence of events, not an independent supervening cause.\n\nSo, the most likely result is that the driver will recover only a portion of his damages, because both he and the defendant were at fault, and his inattention contributes to the accident, as the abandoned car was in plain view.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
