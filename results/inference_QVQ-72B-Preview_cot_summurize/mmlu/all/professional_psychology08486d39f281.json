                    "text": "So I have this scenario about Alice A., who has a master's degree in clinical psychology but isn't licensed. She's been hired by a community mental health clinic to administer several standard psychological tests to adult clients. And I need to figure out, according to ethical guidelines, which of these options is correct:\n\nA. It's acceptable as long as a professional clinical psychologist co-signs Alice's evaluations.\n\nB. It's acceptable as long as a professional clinical psychologist supervises Alice's activities.\n\nC. It's unacceptable because Alice is not a licensed psychologist.\n\nD. It's unacceptable because Alice doesn't have a doctoral degree.\n\nHmm, this is about professional boundaries and supervision. I know that in many fields, especially in healthcare and psychology, there are strict ethical guidelines about what professionals with different levels of training can do.\n\nFirst, I should consider what a master's degree in clinical psychology typically prepares someone to do. A master's degree in clinical psychology usually provides training in assessment and therapy, but often, to practice independently, a doctoral degree and licensure are required.\n\nSo, Alice has some training but isn't licensed. That means she probably can't practice independently, but she might be able to work under supervision.\n\nOption C says it's unacceptable because she's not licensed. That seems straightforward, but maybe there are circumstances where supervised practice is allowed.\n\nOption D says it's unacceptable because she doesn't have a doctoral degree. Again, that seems relevant because doctoral-level training is typically required for independent practice in clinical psychology.\n\nBut what about options A and B? Option A suggests that if a licensed psychologist co-signs her evaluations, it's acceptable. Option B says that if there's supervision by a licensed psychologist, it's acceptable.\n\nI think supervision is important here. Supervision would involve a licensed psychologist overseeing Alice's work, providing guidance, and taking responsibility for her actions. Co-signing might just mean that the supervisor approves the evaluations, but supervision seems more comprehensive, involving ongoing oversight and support.\n\nIn many professional settings, especially in training or when someone is not yet licensed, working under supervision is permitted. So, option B seems plausible.\n\nOption A, co-signing evaluations, might not be sufficient because it's just approving the final product, but supervision involves more than that\u2014it involves ensuring that the entire process is done correctly.\n\nOn the other hand, option C and D both say it's unacceptable, but for different reasons. Option C focuses on licensure, while option D focuses on the doctoral degree.\n\nI need to think about whether licensure is the key factor here or if it's the level of education.\n\nIn many states, individuals with a master's degree in clinical psychology can work in certain capacities under supervision, even without a doctoral degree. They might be called master's-level clinicians or something similar.\n\nSo, perhaps it's not necessarily that Alice can't do this work because she doesn't have a doctoral degree, but rather because she's not licensed.\n\nBut wait, licensure typically requires a doctoral degree in clinical psychology, so being unlicensed and having only a master's degree might be two sides of the same coin.\n\nI need to find out what the ethical guidelines say about this. Maybe I should look at the American Psychological Association's (APA) ethics code or guidelines for psychological assessment.\n\nAccording to the APA Ethics Code, psychologists should only provide services that are within their competence, which is defined by their education, training, supervised experience, consultation, study, and professional experience.\n\nSo, Alice has a master's degree, which is less than a doctoral degree, which is the standard for clinical psychologists.\n\nBut perhaps in some settings, master's-level professionals can administer psychological tests under supervision.\n\nI found that in some states, master's-level clinicians can administer psychological tests and even interpret them under the supervision of a licensed psychologist.\n\nSo, maybe option B is correct: it's acceptable as long as a professional clinical psychologist supervises Alice's activities.\n\nOption A, co-signing evaluations, might not be enough because supervision involves more than just signing off on the final report; it involves ongoing guidance and oversight.\n\nOption C says it's unacceptable because she's not licensed. While that's true, in some contexts, supervised practice is allowed for unlicensed professionals.\n\nOption D says it's unacceptable because she doesn't have a doctoral degree. Again, in some settings, master's-level professionals can perform certain tasks under supervision.\n\nSo, between options C and D, I think C is more accurate because licensure is often tied to the regulatory standards of the state, which consider both education and experience.\n\nBut supervision is a key component here. So, if supervision is in place, then it might be acceptable for Alice to administer these tests.\n\nI think the best answer is B: it's acceptable as long as a professional clinical psychologist supervises Alice's activities.\n\nTo make sure, I'll check another source. Let's see what the National Register of Health Service Psychologists says about this.\n\nThe National Register notes that while doctoral-level training is required for full licensure as a psychologist, master's-level professionals can provide many psychological services under supervision.\n\nThey can administer and score psychological tests, conduct interviews, and even provide therapy under the guidance of a licensed psychologist.\n\nSo, this aligns with option B.\n\nOption A, co-signing evaluations, might be a part of supervision, but supervision is a broader concept that includes training, observation, and feedback.\n\nTherefore, supervision is more comprehensive and ensures that Alice's work meets professional standards.\n\nSo, I think option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
