                    "text": "Let's dive into this contract law problem. So, we've got a buyer and a seller who agreed on September 1 that the seller would sell 10,000 widgets to the buyer at $1 per widget. The delivery was supposed to happen no later than September 30. But then, on September 15, there's this worldwide shortage of widgets, and the market price skyrockets. Because of this, the seller decides not to deliver the widgets to the buyer. The seller sends a letter to the buyer saying that the widgets won't be delivered, and the buyer gets this letter on September 20. Now, the buyer is suing the seller for breach of contract, and the question is, what should be considered the market price of the widgets for the purpose of calculating damages? The options are:\n\nA. The market price on September 1.\n\nB. The market price on September 15.\n\nC. The market price on September 20.\n\nD. The market price on September 30.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall how damages are calculated in a breach of contract scenario, especially concerning the market price. I remember that in contract law, when one party breaches a contract, the non-breaching party is entitled to compensatory damages. These damages are intended to put the non-breaching party in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed.\n\nIn the case of goods, like widgets here, the measure of damages typically involves the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach or the time of delivery. So, I need to figure out which date is relevant for determining the market price.\n\nLet's look at the timeline:\n\n- September 1: Contract is made ($1 per widget).\n\n- September 15: Worldwide shortage causes a price increase, and the seller decides not to deliver.\n\n- September 20: The buyer receives the letter from the seller stating that the widgets won't be delivered.\n\n- September 30: The original delivery deadline.\n\n- October 15: The buyer files suit against the seller for breach of contract.\n\nOkay, so the breach occurs when the seller decides not to perform and notifies the buyer on September 20. In contract law, the buyer is deemed to have knowledge of the breach at the time they receive notice, which is September 20.\n\nGenerally, the market price at the time of the breach is used to calculate damages. The breach happens when the seller repudiates the contract, which is effectively what's happening here\u2014they're saying they won't deliver the widgets.\n\nSo, the buyer learns of this breach on September 20, which might make that the relevant date for the market price.\n\nBut wait, there's also the delivery date, September 30. If the seller had waited until September 30 to inform the buyer that they weren't delivering, the breach would have been on September 30, the date when performance was due.\n\nBut in this case, the seller informed the buyer earlier, on September 20, that they wouldn't be delivering. So, the buyer has to mitigate their damages from that point onward.\n\nTherefore, the market price at the time the buyer learned of the breach, which is September 20, would be the relevant one for calculating damages.\n\nLet me double-check this.\n\nIn contract law, when there's an anticipatory repudiation\u2014meaning the seller says they won't perform before the performance is due\u2014the buyer can treat the repudiation as a breach immediately, or they can wait until the performance date. In this scenario, the seller has clearly indicated they won't perform, and the buyer has acknowledged this by filing suit on October 15.\n\nSo, the breach occurred on September 20, when the buyer received the letter stating that the widgets wouldn't be delivered.\n\nTherefore, the market price on September 20 would be the relevant one for calculating damages.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other perspective.\n\nMaybe the seller's decision to not deliver was on September 15, when the market price increased. But the buyer didn't know about it until September 20. In contract law, the breach is typically measured from when the non-breaching party knows or should have known about the breach.\n\nSo, September 20 seems the right date.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the market price on September 30, the delivery date, could be considered if the buyer had waited until then to see if the seller performed.\n\nBut since the seller explicitly said they wouldn't deliver on September 20, and the buyer took action based on that knowledge, it makes sense to use September 20's market price.\n\nI don't think the market price on September 1 is relevant because that was before the breach occurred.\n\nSimilarly, September 15 is when the price increased and the seller decided not to deliver, but again, the buyer didn't know about it until September 20.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be C: The market price on September 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
