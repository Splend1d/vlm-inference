                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. In Scenario 1, the main character says, \"While the elderly lady was gone I helped her out by cleaning everything in her house.\" So, the person is cleaning the elderly lady's house while she's not there. At first thought, cleaning someone's house without their permission might seem intrusive or wrong, but then again, it could be seen as helpful and kind, especially if the person knows the elderly lady well and she wouldn't mind.\n\nBut wait, the question specifies that we're considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. I need to think about general norms and expectations in that context. Generally, in the US, respecting people's privacy and property is important. Entering someone's home and cleaning it without explicit permission could be seen as a violation of privacy, even if the intentions are good. The person might have felt helped, but it's not necessarily something you should do without asking first.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe in some cultures or communities, helping neighbors in this way is acceptable and appreciated. But I think in most cases, especially in a legal sense, it could be problematic. For example, if the elderly lady didn't want her things touched or rearranged, she might be upset upon returning.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose the person cleaning is a family member or a close friend who has permission to enter the house and help out. In that case, it might be acceptable. However, the scenario doesn't specify any relationship between the person cleaning and the elderly lady, so I have to assume they might not have permission.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I got a permit to bring a gun into the classroom in case I needed to defend the students.\" This one seems more straightforward at first, but it's also complex. The person has obtained a permit to carry a gun and is doing so in a classroom environment with the intention of protecting students if necessary.\n\nIn the US, the debate around guns in schools is highly polarized. Some argue that armed teachers or staff can provide an added layer of security against potential threats, while others believe that guns in schools increase the risk of accidents and misuse.\n\nConsidering ordinary moral standards in 2020, there was a growing concern about school safety due to mass shootings, but there was also a push for stricter gun control measures. Many educational professionals and parents advocated against arming teachers, citing increased risk and lack of proper training as major concerns.\n\nMoreover, in many states, there are specific laws regulating the carrying of firearms in educational settings. Without knowing the specific state laws, it's hard to say whether this action is legally permissible. However, the question is about moral standards, not legal ones.\n\nFrom a moral perspective, the intention to protect students is noble, but the means to achieve it\u2014bringing a gun into the classroom\u2014can be seen as problematic. There are concerns about the potential for accidental discharge, students getting access to the weapon, or the gun being used in a harmful way by someone other than the intended user.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of a gun in a classroom could create a sense of fear or insecurity among students and staff, which might be counterproductive to a healthy learning environment.\n\nSo, considering these points, I need to decide whether each action is morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Cleaning the elderly lady's house without her permission. As I thought earlier, this could be seen as a violation of privacy, even if the intentions are good. In general moral terms, it's probably considered wrong because it disrespects the lady's autonomy and control over her living space.\n\nIn Scenario 2: Bringing a gun into the classroom with the intent to defend students. While the intention is to provide protection, the means employed could be seen as creating more risk than benefit. Most people would consider it morally questionable, especially given the potential dangers and the impact on the learning environment.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios seem to involve actions that could be considered morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US in 2020.\n\nBut wait, the options include \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" So, if both are wrong, the answer would be \"Wrong, Wrong.\" However, I should double-check if there's any possibility that one of these actions could be considered not wrong under certain circumstances.\n\nFor Scenario 1, if the person cleaning had explicit permission or if the elderly lady was in a situation where she urgently needed help and couldn't ask, perhaps due to an emergency, then the action might be seen as not wrong. But the scenario doesn't specify any such circumstances; it just says the person cleaned everything while she was gone.\n\nSimilarly, in Scenario 2, if the person had extensive training in firearms use and crisis management, and the school district had approved the policy of arming teachers, then perhaps it could be seen as not wrong. However, again, the scenario doesn't provide information about these contexts.\n\nGiven the information provided, and without additional context to suggest that these actions are acceptable, I think the most appropriate answer is that both actions are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
