Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's the original lease between the landlord and the tenant. The tenant rented the building for 20 years at $10,000 per month. The lease agreement says that the tenant can't assign the lease to anyone except a corporation with an \"A\" credit rating from a well-known credit rating company.\n\nThen, on February 1 of the following year, the tenant leases the premises to a corporation that doesn't have the required \"A\" credit rating. This lease is for five years at $15,000 per month, and the corporation agrees to abide by all the terms and conditions of the original lease between the landlord and the tenant.\n\nOne year later, the corporation leases the premises to a health club for the remaining term of the corporation-tenant lease. The health club takes possession on February 1 and pays $17,500 per month directly to the corporation. The health club has a \"B\" credit rating.\n\nFor one year, the health club pays $17,500 each month to the corporation, the corporation pays $15,000 to the tenant, and the tenant pays $10,000 to the landlord. The landlord knows about these subleases but doesn't take any action as long as he gets his $10,000 per month from the tenant.\n\nThen, the health club abandons the premises and stops paying rent to the corporation. As a result, the corporation stops paying rent to the tenant, and the tenant stops paying rent to the landlord.\n\nNow, the landlord wants to sue for past rent due. The question is, who can the landlord recover rent from?\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. The landlord may recover against the tenant for past rent due.\n\nWell, in the original lease, the tenant is directly liable to the landlord for rent payments. Even though the tenant subleased to the corporation and the corporation subleased to the health club, the original lease between the landlord and the tenant remains in effect unless it was assigned properly.\n\nHowever, the assignment was subject to the condition that the assignee must have an \"A\" credit rating, which the corporation did not have. So, the tenant may have breached the lease agreement by assigning it to the corporation without meeting the credit rating requirement.\n\nDespite that, the landlord knew about the sublease to the corporation and the health club but didn't take any immediate action, as long as he was getting his rent from the tenant. This might suggest that the landlord consented to the subleases by not objecting, especially since he continued to accept rent from the tenant.\n\nIn general, when a tenant subleases, the original tenant remains liable to the landlord for rent payments unless there's a specific release in the lease agreement. So, even if the subtenant stops paying, the original tenant is still responsible for the rent.\n\nTherefore, the landlord can likely sue the tenant for past rent due.\n\nB. The landlord may recover against the corporation for past rent due.\n\nThe corporation is a subtenant of the tenant, having leased directly from the tenant. However, the corporation doesn't have the required \"A\" credit rating, which might make the assignment invalid under the original lease terms.\n\nBut, since the landlord was aware of the sublease and didn't object, there might be an implication that he consented to it. In that case, the corporation might be considered a subtenant with some responsibilities.\n\nHowever, the corporation is not directly contracting with the landlord; its lease is with the tenant. So, unless there's some privity of contract or estoppel that brings the corporation into a direct relationship with the landlord, it's unclear whether the landlord can directly sue the corporation for rent.\n\nC. The landlord may recover against the health club for past rent due.\n\nThe health club is a sub-subtenant, having leased from the corporation. Again, the health club doesn't have a direct lease with the landlord. It's possible that through multiple subleases, the landlord could try to hold the health club responsible for rent, but generally, the landlord's recourse is against the immediate tenant, which is the original tenant.\n\nUnless there's some specific provision in the lease that allows the landlord to reach down to sub-subtenants, it's unlikely that the landlord can directly sue the health club for rent.\n\nD. The landlord may recover against the corporation and the health club, jointly and severally, for past rent due.\n\nThis seems like a combination of options B and C. Given the same reasoning as above, it's doubtful that the landlord can sue both the corporation and the health club directly for rent.\n\nSo, based on standard landlord-tenant law, the most straightforward answer is that the landlord can recover against the original tenant for past rent due. The tenant remains primarily liable for the rent payments, regardless of any subleases.\n\nHowever, there might be some exceptions or specific provisions in the lease that could affect this conclusion. For example, if the lease allows the landlord to sue subtenants or sub-subtenants under certain circumstances, that could change things.\n\nAlso, the fact that the landlord knew about the subleases and didn't object might imply that he consented to them, which could affect his rights against the subtenants.\n\nBut, absent any specific provisions to the contrary, the general rule is that the landlord can sue the original tenant for rent payments.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is A: The landlord may recover against the tenant for past rent due.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
