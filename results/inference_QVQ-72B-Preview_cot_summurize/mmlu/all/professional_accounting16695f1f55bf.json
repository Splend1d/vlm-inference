                    "text": "So I have this problem here about calculating the yield on a US Treasury bill using the Bond Equivalent Yield (BEY) method. The treasury bill is worth $1,000, has a maturity of 13 weeks, and I'm supposed to find the yield if it's purchased for $960. The options are A. 16.0 percent, B. 16.7 percent, C. 17.0 percent, and D. 17.8 percent.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Bond Equivalent Yield is. I know that BEY is a way to express the yield on short-term debt instruments, especially those that discount below their face value, like T-bills. It standardizes the yield to a 365-day basis, which helps in comparing different investments.\n\nThe formula for BEY that I remember is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{BEY} = \\left( \\frac{F - P}{P} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{365}{D} \\right)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(F\\) is the face value of the security.\n\n- \\(P\\) is the purchase price.\n\n- \\(D\\) is the number of days until maturity.\n\nGiven that, I have:\n\n- \\(F = \\$1,000\\)\n\n- \\(P = \\$960\\)\n\n- \\(D = 13\\) weeks. But I need to convert weeks into days. Since there are 7 days in a week, \\(D = 13 \\times 7 = 91\\) days.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{BEY} = \\left( \\frac{1000 - 960}{960} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{365}{91} \\right)\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate the first part:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1000 - 960}{960} = \\frac{40}{960} = 0.041666...\n\\]\n\nThat's approximately 4.1667%.\n\nNow, the second part:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{365}{91} \\approx 4.010989\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply the two parts together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{BEY} \\approx 0.041667 \\times 4.010989 \\approx 0.167 \\text{ or } 16.7\\%\n\\]\n\nLooking back at the options, that corresponds to option B. 16.7 percent.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the face value is $1,000, and the purchase price is $960, so the discount is $40.\n\nThe yield calculation is the discount divided by the purchase price, which is \\( \\frac{40}{960} \\approx 0.041667 \\), which is correct.\n\nThen, converting the maturity to a 365-day basis from 91 days: \\( \\frac{365}{91} \\approx 4.010989 \\), that also seems right.\n\nMultiplying them together: \\( 0.041667 \\times 4.010989 \\approx 0.167 \\) or 16.7%, which is option B.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother formula I've seen for BEY, especially for T-bills, is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{BEY} = \\left( \\frac{F - P}{F} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{365}{D} \\right)\n\\]\n\nIn this case, using \\( \\frac{F - P}{F} \\) instead of \\( \\frac{F - P}{P} \\).\n\nLet me try this formula as well to see if I get the same result.\n\nGiven the same values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{BEY} = \\left( \\frac{1000 - 960}{1000} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{365}{91} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{40}{1000} \\right) \\times 4.010989 = 0.04 \\times 4.010989 \\approx 0.1604 \\text{ or } 16.04\\%\n\\]\n\nThat gives me approximately 16.04%, which is close to option A. 16.0 percent.\n\nNow, I need to figure out which one is the correct formula to use. I recall that the first formula, with \\( \\frac{F - P}{P} \\), is more common for BEY calculations because it uses the purchase price as the base, which is the amount being invested.\n\nThe second formula, with \\( \\frac{F - P}{F} \\), might be used in some contexts, but I think it's less standard for BEY calculations.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with the first calculation, which leads to option B. 16.7 percent.\n\nJust to cross-verify, let's think about the holding period return.\n\nThe holding period return would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{HPR} = \\frac{F - P}{P} = \\frac{40}{960} \\approx 0.041667 \\text{ or } 4.1667\\%\n\\]\n\nTo annualize this over 365 days from a 91-day period:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Annualized yield} = 0.041667 \\times \\frac{365}{91} \\approx 0.041667 \\times 4.010989 \\approx 0.167 \\text{ or } 16.7\\%\n\\]\n\nThis reinforces the initial calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B. 16.7 percent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
