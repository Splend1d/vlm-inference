                    "text": "So I've got this question here with two statements about group theory, and I need to determine whether each statement is true or false. Let's tackle them one by one.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: \"Every group of order p\u00b2 where p is prime is Abelian.\"\n\nHmm, I remember that in group theory, a group is Abelian if its operation is commutative, meaning that for any two elements a and b in the group, a * b = b * a. So, the question is whether all groups of order p squared, where p is a prime number, have this property.\n\nLet me recall some facts about groups of order p\u00b2. I think there's a theorem that classifies groups of small orders, especially when the order is a square of a prime. Let's see... Oh, right! I think there's a result that says that any group of order p\u00b2 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p.\n\nSpecifically, if G is a group of order p\u00b2, then G is either cyclic, meaning there's an element that generates the whole group, or it's isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p, which is sometimes called the Klein four-group when p=2, but generally, it's like a two-dimensional vector space over the field with p elements.\n\nWait a minute, but is this relevant to whether the group is Abelian? Yes, because both cyclic groups and direct products of cyclic groups of prime order are Abelian.\n\nLet me confirm that. If G is cyclic, then it's generated by one element, and cyclic groups are always Abelian because powers of the generator commute with each other. Similarly, if G is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p, say C_p \u00d7 C_p, then it's also Abelian because the operation is component-wise, and both components commute.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that every group of order p\u00b2 is indeed Abelian. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nNow, moving on to Statement 2: \"For a fixed prime p, a Sylow p-subgroup of a group G is a normal subgroup of G if and only if it is the only Sylow p-subgroup of G.\"\n\nAlright, this one involves Sylow subgroups, which are important in group theory. Let's recall what a Sylow p-subgroup is. For a group G and a prime p, a Sylow p-subgroup is a subgroup of G whose order is the highest power of p dividing the order of G. Moreover, the number of Sylow p-subgroups in G, denoted by n_p, satisfies certain properties according to Sylow's Theorems.\n\nSpecifically, Sylow's Theorems state that:\n\n1. There exists at least one Sylow p-subgroup.\n\n2. All Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate to each other.\n\n3. The number of Sylow p-subgroups, n_p, divides the index of the p-subgroup in G, and n_p \u2261 1 mod p.\n\nNow, the statement claims that a Sylow p-subgroup is normal in G if and only if it is the only Sylow p-subgroup.\n\nFirst, what does it mean for a subgroup to be normal? A subgroup H of G is normal if for every g in G and h in H, the element g h g\u207b\u00b9 is also in H. In other words, conjugation by any element of G maps H to itself.\n\nGiven that, and considering Sylow's Second Theorem, which states that all Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate, meaning that for any two Sylow p-subgroups P and Q, there exists a g in G such that g P g\u207b\u00b9 = Q.\n\nSo, if there is only one Sylow p-subgroup, say P, then for any g in G, g P g\u207b\u00b9 must also be a Sylow p-subgroup, but since P is the only one, g P g\u207b\u00b9 = P. This means that P is invariant under conjugation by any element of G, which is the definition of being normal.\n\nTherefore, if there is only one Sylow p-subgroup, it must be normal.\n\nNow, for the converse: if a Sylow p-subgroup is normal, then it is the only Sylow p-subgroup.\n\nWell, if P is a normal Sylow p-subgroup, then for any g in G, g P g\u207b\u00b9 = P. But according to Sylow's Second Theorem, g P g\u207b\u00b9 is also a Sylow p-subgroup. So, any other Sylow p-subgroup Q would satisfy Q = g P g\u207b\u00b9 for some g in G, which implies Q = P. Therefore, P is the only Sylow p-subgroup.\n\nSo, both directions hold: a Sylow p-subgroup is normal if and only if it is the only Sylow p-subgroup.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nSo, both statements are true. That would make the answer A. True, True.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check again.\n\nFor Statement 1, groups of order p\u00b2 are indeed Abelian, as they are either cyclic or a direct product of two cyclic groups of order p, both of which are Abelian.\n\nFor Statement 2, a Sylow p-subgroup is normal in G if and only if it is the only Sylow p-subgroup, which aligns with Sylow's Theorems.\n\nYes, I'm confident that both statements are true.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ True, True}} \\]"
