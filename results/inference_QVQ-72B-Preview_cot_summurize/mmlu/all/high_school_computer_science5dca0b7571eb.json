                    "text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about student ID numbers being assigned in binary and they increase by 1 with each new student. The last student enrolled had the binary number 1001 0011, and I need to find out what binary number will be assigned to the next student. The options are A. 1001 0100, B. 1001 0111, C. 1101 0100, and D. 1101 0111.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. Each student gets a unique ID number, and these numbers are stored as binary numbers. The IDs are assigned sequentially, meaning each new student gets the previous student's ID plus one. So, if the last student had 1001 0011, the next student should have that number plus one.\n\nAlright, so the main operation I need to perform is to take the binary number 1001 0011 and add one to it, and then see which of the given options matches the result.\n\nBut before I do that, I should make sure I understand how binary addition works. Binary addition follows the same principles as decimal addition but with base 2. That means every time you have a carry-over, it's based on twos rather than tens.\n\nLet me recall the binary addition rules:\n\n- 0 + 0 = 0\n\n- 0 + 1 = 1\n\n- 1 + 0 = 1\n\n- 1 + 1 = 0, and carry over 1 to the next higher bit.\n\nSo, when adding one to a binary number, you start from the least significant bit (the rightmost bit) and add one. If that bit is 0, it becomes 1, and that's it. If it's 1, it becomes 0, and you carry over one to the next bit.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the last bit of 1001 0011. The last bit is 1, so when I add one, it should become 0, and I should carry over one to the next bit.\n\nSo, starting from the right:\n\n- The rightmost bit is 1, add 1: 1 + 1 = 0, carry 1.\n\n- The next bit is 1, add the carried 1: 1 + 1 = 0, carry 1.\n\n- The next bit is 0, add the carried 1: 0 + 1 = 1, no carry.\n\n- The next bit is 0, no carried bit to add: 0 + 0 = 0.\n\n- The next bit is 1, no carried bit to add: 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n- The next bit is 0, no carried bit to add: 0 + 0 = 0.\n\n- The next bit is 0, no carried bit to add: 0 + 0 = 0.\n\n- The leftmost bit is 1, no carried bit to add: 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nSo, writing that out, the new binary number should be 1001 0100.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1001 0100\n\nB. 1001 0111\n\nC. 1101 0100\n\nD. 1101 0111\n\nIt seems that option A is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to approach this or something I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the binary number to decimal, add one, and then convert back to binary to verify.\n\nFirst, convert 1001 0011 to decimal.\n\nBinary 1001 0011:\n\n- Starting from the right:\n\n- 1 (2^0) = 1\n\n- 1 (2^1) = 2\n\n- 0 (2^2) = 0\n\n- 0 (2^3) = 0\n\n- 1 (2^4) = 16\n\n- 0 (2^5) = 0\n\n- 0 (2^6) = 0\n\n- 1 (2^7) = 128\n\n- So, total decimal value: 1 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 16 + 0 + 0 + 128 = 147.\n\nNow, add one to 147, which makes 148.\n\nNow, convert 148 back to binary.\n\nLet's do that step by step.\n\nFind the highest power of 2 less than or equal to 148.\n\n2^7 = 128\n\n128 < 148, so we can use 2^7.\n\n148 - 128 = 20\n\nNext, 2^4 = 16, which is less than 20.\n\n20 - 16 = 4\n\nNext, 2^2 = 4, which equals 4.\n\n4 - 4 = 0\n\nSo, the binary representation is:\n\n2^7 (128) + 2^4 (16) + 2^2 (4) + 2^1 (2) + 2^0 (1)\n\nWait, hold on. I think I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again.\n\nActually, when I subtracted 128 from 148, I got 20.\n\nThen, 20 - 16 = 4\n\nThen, 4 - 4 = 0\n\nSo, the bits that are 1 are positions where the powers of two add up to 148.\n\nSo, 2^7 (128) + 2^4 (16) + 2^2 (4) = 148.\n\nBut in binary, that would be:\n\n1 at position 7 (128)\n\n1 at position 4 (16)\n\n1 at position 2 (4)\n\nAnd the rest are 0.\n\nSo, writing that out: 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, but the original number was 1001 0011, which is 8 bits, and I'm getting 1001 0100, which is also 8 bits.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it with the same number of bits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just add one directly to the binary number as I did initially.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the first method is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the student IDs might wrap around or something, but given the options, it seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is testing whether I understand binary addition properly.\n\nGiven that, and based on my initial calculation, 1001 0011 plus 1 should be 1001 0100.\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect this.\n\nIs there any possibility of overflow or something since it's a binary number?\n\nWell, if it's an 8-bit binary number, the highest value is 1111 1111, which is 255 in decimal. Adding one to that would wrap around to 0000 0000. But in this case, the number we're adding one to is 1001 0011, which is 147 in decimal, and adding one gives 148, which is within the range of an 8-bit number.\n\nSo, no issues with overflow here.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option A: 1001 0100.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 1001\\ 0100} \\]"
