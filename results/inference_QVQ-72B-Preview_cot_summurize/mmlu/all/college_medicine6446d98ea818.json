                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about DNA sequences and mutations. The original DNA segment is 5\u2019 \u2013 GGATCCTCATG \u2013 3\u2019. I need to figure out which of the given options represents both a point mutation and a deletion in this original sequence.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a point mutation and a deletion are. A point mutation is a change in a single nucleotide in the DNA sequence. That means one base is replaced by another. A deletion is when one or more nucleotides are removed from the sequence.\n\nSo, in this case, the original sequence undergoes both a point mutation and a deletion. That means one base changes to another, and one or more bases are removed.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 5\u2019 \u2013 GCATCCTCATG \u2013 3\u2019\n\nB. 5\u2019 \u2013 TGATCCCAG \u2013 3\u2019\n\nC. 5\u2019 \u2013 GGTCCTCATC \u2013 3\u2019\n\nD. 5\u2019 \u2013 GGATCCATG \u2013 3\u2019\n\nI need to compare each option to the original sequence to see which one shows both a point mutation and a deletion.\n\nLet's start with option A: 5\u2019 \u2013 GCATCCTCATG \u2013 3\u2019\n\nComparing it to the original:\n\nOriginal: 5\u2019 \u2013 GGATCCTCATG \u2013 3\u2019\n\nOption A: 5\u2019 \u2013 GCATCCTCATG \u2013 3\u2019\n\nLooking at the second base: original has GA, but option A has CA. That looks like a point mutation from G to C and a deletion of A. Wait, but if it's a point mutation and a deletion, it should show both changes.\n\nBut in option A, if there's a mutation from G to C and a deletion of A, then the sequence would be: starting with G, then C instead of G, and then ATCCTCATG, but it seems like the A is deleted, so it should be GC instead of GA, and then TCC... but that doesn't match option A directly. Maybe I'm miscounting the positions.\n\nLet me align the sequences:\n\nOriginal: 5\u2019 \u2013 G G A T C C T C A T G \u2013 3\u2019\n\nOption A: 5\u2019 \u2013 G C A T C C T C A T G \u2013 3\u2019\n\nComparing base by base:\n\nPos 1: G = G\n\nPos 2: G \u2260 C \u2192 point mutation\n\nPos 3: A \u2260 A \u2192 no change, but in option A, it's C, which suggests a deletion or another mutation, but that doesn't make sense because it's supposed to be only one point mutation and one deletion.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that mutations can occur anywhere in the sequence, not just at specific positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point mutation and the deletion are happening at the same position, like a substitution and a deletion, but that seems unlikely.\n\nLet me try option B: 5\u2019 \u2013 T G A T C C C A G \u2013 3\u2019\n\nOriginal: 5\u2019 \u2013 G G A T C C T C A T G \u2013 3\u2019\n\nOption B: 5\u2019 \u2013 T G A T C C C A G \u2013 3\u2019\n\nFirst, the lengths are different; the original is 12 bases, and option B is 9 bases. That suggests there are deletions, but also, there are changes in bases.\n\nLet me align them:\n\nOriginal: G G A T C C T C A T G\n\nOption B: T G A T C C C A G\n\nDifferences:\n\nPos 1: G \u2260 T \u2192 point mutation or deletion-insertion\n\nPos 2: G \u2260 G \u2192 no change, but in option B, it's G, which matches, but the next base is A, which is different from T in the original.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should look for areas where a single base is changed (mutation) and where one or more bases are deleted.\n\nLooking at option B, the sequence is quite different, with many changes, so it's probably not just a single point mutation and a single deletion.\n\nLet's try option C: 5\u2019 \u2013 G G T C C T C A T C \u2013 3\u2019\n\nOriginal: 5\u2019 \u2013 G G A T C C T C A T G \u2013 3\u2019\n\nOption C: 5\u2019 \u2013 G G T C C T C A T C \u2013 3\u2019\n\nComparing:\n\nPos 1: G = G\n\nPos 2: G = G\n\nPos 3: A \u2260 T \u2192 point mutation\n\nPos 4: T = C \u2192 wait, original has T, option C has C, which is different, but if A mutated to T, and T is now C, that's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe there are multiple mutations, but the problem states both a point mutation and a deletion, implying one of each.\n\nLooking at the lengths, original is 12, option C is 11, so one base is deleted.\n\nLooking at the sequences:\n\nOriginal: GGATCCTCATG\n\nOption C: GGTCCTCATC\n\nComparing:\n\nPos 1-2: GG = GG\n\nPos 3: original A, option C has T \u2192 point mutation A\u2192T\n\nPos 4-5: original TC, option C has CC \u2192 deletion of one C or insertion of an extra C.\n\nWait, but deletions remove bases, they don't add them. So, if option C has an extra C compared to the original, that would suggest an insertion, not a deletion.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a slip in counting positions. Let's re-examine:\n\nOriginal: 1-G 2-G 3-A 4-T 5-C 6-C 7-T 8-C 9-A 10-T 11-G\n\nOption C: 1-G 2-G 3-T 4-C 5-C 6-T 7-C 8-A 9-T 10-C\n\nComparing:\n\nPos 1-2: same\n\nPos 3: A\u2192T \u2192 point mutation\n\nPos 4: T\u2192C \u2192 but if there's a deletion, perhaps a base is missing.\n\nWait, maybe the point mutation is at position 3, A\u2192T, and there's a deletion of T at position 4.\n\nSo, original: GGA T CC T CAT G\n\nOption C: GGA T CC T CAT C\n\nWait, but in option C, the sequence is GGTCCTCATC, which would be G-G-T-C-C-T-C-A-T-C.\n\nComparing to original G-G-A-T-C-C-T-C-A-T-G, it seems like:\n\nPos 1-2: same\n\nPos 3: A\u2192T \u2192 point mutation\n\nThen, pos 4-5: original T-C, option C has C-C, so perhaps deletion of T.\n\nPos 6-11: C-T-C-A-T-G vs. C-T-C-A-T-C, difference at pos 11: G\u2192C.\n\nWait, but if pos 3 is mutated to T, and pos 4 is deleted, then the sequence shifts.\n\nLet me write it down:\n\nOriginal: G G A T C C T C A T G\n\nOption C: G G T C C T C A T C\n\nDifferences:\n\nPos 1-2: same\n\nPos 3: A\u2192T \u2192 point mutation\n\nPos 4: T deleted \u2192 so original has T, option C has nothing, but in the sequence, it's still GGTCCC, which suggests the T is deleted.\n\nWait, in option C, the sequence is GGTCCTCATC, which seems to have the T deleted after the second G.\n\nSo, original: GGA T CC T CAT G\n\nOption C: GG T CC T CAT C\n\nYes, point mutation A\u2192T at pos 3, and deletion of T at pos 4.\n\nSo, this fits the description of one point mutation and one deletion.\n\nBut let's check option D: 5\u2019 \u2013 G G A T C C A T G \u2013 3\u2019\n\nOriginal: 5\u2019 \u2013 G G A T C C T C A T G \u2013 3\u2019\n\nOption D: 5\u2019 \u2013 G G A T C C A T G \u2013 3\u2019\n\nComparing:\n\nPos 1-6: same (GGATCC)\n\nPos 7: original T, option D has A \u2192 point mutation T\u2192A\n\nPos 8-11: original C A T G, option D has T G, so deletion of C and A.\n\nSo, in option D, there's a point mutation (T\u2192A) and a deletion of two bases (C and A).\n\nBut the problem specifies both a point mutation and a deletion. A point mutation is one base change, and a deletion can be one or more bases.\n\nSo, option D has one point mutation and a deletion of two bases, which fits the description.\n\nBut option C has one point mutation and one deletion (of one base).\n\nSo, both options C and D seem to fit the criteria of having both a point mutation and a deletion.\n\nBut the problem likely expects only one correct answer, so I need to see which one exactly matches the requirements.\n\nLooking back, option C has one point mutation and one deletion, while option D has one point mutation and a deletion of two bases.\n\nPerhaps the problem considers \"a deletion\" to be a single base deletion, not multiple bases.\n\nIn DNA, a deletion can be of any number of bases, but often, single base deletions are considered point deletions, while larger deletions are just called deletions.\n\nBut in this context, since point mutations involve single base changes, perhaps the problem intends for only one base to be mutated and one base to be deleted.\n\nIn that case, option C has one base mutated (A\u2192T at position 3) and one base deleted (T at position 4), resulting in the sequence GGTCCTCATC.\n\nOption D has one base mutated (T\u2192A at position 7) and two bases deleted (C and A at positions 8 and 9), which doesn't match the \"both a point mutation and a deletion\" requirement, as it's a point mutation and a deletion of two bases.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer, as it shows both a point mutation and a single base deletion.\n\nBut to confirm, let's look back at options A and B.\n\nOption A: 5\u2019 \u2013 G C A T C C T C A T G \u2013 3\u2019\n\nComparing to original:\n\nPos 1: G = G\n\nPos 2: G\u2192C \u2192 point mutation\n\nPos 3: A = A \u2192 no change\n\nPos 4-12: same as original\n\nSo, option A has a point mutation at position 2 (G\u2192C), but no deletion. The sequence length is the same as the original, so no deletion occurred.\n\nTherefore, option A only has a point mutation, not a deletion, so it's incorrect.\n\nOption B: 5\u2019 \u2013 T G A T C C C A G \u2013 3\u2019\n\nComparing to original:\n\nPos 1: G\u2192T \u2192 point mutation\n\nPos 2: G = G\n\nPos 3: A = A\n\nPos 4: T\u2192T \u2192 same\n\nPos 5: C = C\n\nPos 6: C = C\n\nPos 7: T\u2192C \u2192 point mutation\n\nPos 8: C\u2192A \u2192 point mutation\n\nPos 9: A\u2192G \u2192 point mutation\n\nPos 10: T\u2192 nothing, deletion\n\nPos 11: G\u2192 nothing, deletion\n\nSo, option B has multiple point mutations and deletions, which is more than what the problem specifies. It should only have one point mutation and one deletion.\n\nTherefore, option B is incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct answer is option C, which has one point mutation and one deletion, as required.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
