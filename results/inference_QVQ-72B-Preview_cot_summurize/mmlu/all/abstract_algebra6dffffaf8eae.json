And the options are:\n\nA. semi group with identity\n\nB. commutative semigroups with identity\n\nC. group\n\nD. abelian group\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what the nth roots of unity are. I remember that the nth roots of unity are the complex numbers that satisfy the equation z^n = 1. So, for a given positive integer n, there are exactly n such roots.\n\nFor example, when n=2, the roots are z=1 and z=-1 because both 1^2=1 and (-1)^2=1. Similarly, for n=3, the cube roots of unity are 1, e^(2\u03c0i/3), and e^(4\u03c0i/3).\n\nNow, the problem is asking about these roots under multiplication of complex numbers. I know that complex numbers can be multiplied, and multiplication is a well-defined operation.\n\nI need to figure out what algebraic structure this set forms under multiplication. The options are increasingly specific: from a semigroup with identity, to a commutative semigroup with identity, to a group, and finally to an abelian group.\n\nLet me recall the definitions:\n\n1. **Semigroup**: A set with an associative binary operation.\n\n2. **Semigroup with identity**: A semigroup that also has an identity element for the operation.\n\n3. **Commutative semigroup**: A semigroup where the operation is commutative.\n\n4. **Group**: A set with an associative binary operation, an identity element, and inverses for each element.\n\n5. **Abelian group**: A group where the operation is commutative.\n\nSo, I need to check which of these properties hold for the set of nth roots of unity under multiplication.\n\nFirst, let's consider the set of nth roots of unity. It's a finite set with n elements.\n\n**Closure**: Is the product of two roots another root of the same order? Let's see.\n\nTake two nth roots of unity, say z and w, both satisfying z^n = 1 and w^n = 1.\n\nWhat is (zw)^n?\n\n(zw)^n = z^n * w^n = 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nSo, zw is also an nth root of unity. Therefore, the set is closed under multiplication.\n\n**Associativity**: Multiplication of complex numbers is associative. So, (zw)v = z(wv) for any roots z, w, v.\n\n**Identity**: Is there an element in the set that acts as the identity under multiplication?\n\nYes, the complex number 1 (which is one of the nth roots of unity when n=1) satisfies 1*z = z*1 = z for any z in the set.\n\nSo far, it's looking like a semigroup with identity.\n\nNow, **commutativity**: Is multiplication commutative for these roots?\n\nYes, multiplication of complex numbers is always commutative. z*w = w*z for any complex numbers z and w.\n\nSo, it's a commutative semigroup with identity.\n\nBut wait, the options include \"group\" and \"abelian group\". Let's check if there are inverses for each element.\n\nFor any nth root of unity z, is there another nth root of unity w such that z*w = 1?\n\nWell, since z^n = 1, the multiplicative inverse of z is z^{n-1}, because z * z^{n-1} = z^n = 1.\n\nBut is z^{n-1} also an nth root of unity?\n\nLet's check: (z^{n-1})^n = z^{n(n-1)} = (z^n)^{n-1} = 1^{n-1} = 1.\n\nYes, so every element has an inverse within the set.\n\nTherefore, the set is a group.\n\nMoreover, since multiplication is commutative, it's an abelian group.\n\nBut wait, option D is \"abelian group\", which seems to be the most specific fit.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that all the properties hold.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- Closure: yes\n\n- Associativity: yes\n\n- Identity: yes\n\n- Inverses: yes\n\n- Commutativity: yes\n\nTherefore, it's a group, and specifically, an abelian group.\n\nBut looking back at the options, A is \"semi group with identity\", B is \"commutative semigroups with identity\", C is \"group\", D is \"abelian group\".\n\nGiven that it's an abelian group, which is a group that is commutative, D seems to be the most precise answer.\n\nHowever, I should confirm if there's any difference between B and D.\n\nB says \"commutative semigroups with identity\", and D says \"abelian group\". An abelian group is indeed a commutative group, but it's also a semigroup with identity and inverses. So, D is more specific and accurate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. abelian group.\n\nWait, but in some contexts, people might refer to it as a commutative semigroup with identity, but since it also has inverses, it's better to call it a group, and specifically, an abelian group.\n\nSo, I think D is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
