                    "text": "So I have this question here about Clarence Darrow and his belief about the meaning of life. The options are:\n\nA. Life was not worthwhile.\n\nB. Life was hard but worthwhile.\n\nC. Life was uncertain but ultimately rewarding.\n\nD. Life was meaningful for most people.\n\nI need to figure out which one correctly represents Darrow's view.\n\nFirst, I should probably know who Clarence Darrow is. I recall that he was a famous American lawyer, known for his role in the Scopes \"Monkey\" Trial, where he defended teaching evolution in schools. He was also famous for his persuasive skills and his involvement in labor unions' cases. So, he was a prominent figure in the early 20th century, known for his progressive views and his defense of individual rights.\n\nNow, about his views on life's meaning. I remember that Darrow was an agnostic, meaning he had doubts about the existence of God and was critical of organized religion. This might influence his perspective on life's meaning.\n\nLet me think about option A: \"Life was not worthwhile.\" This seems pretty pessimistic. While Darrow did face a lot of challenges and fought against many injustices, I don't recall him saying that life wasn't worthwhile. In fact, his dedication to fighting for causes he believed in suggests that he found value in life.\n\nOption B: \"Life was hard but worthwhile.\" This seems more plausible. Darrow certainly recognized that life could be difficult, especially for the underprivileged whom he often represented. But his persistent efforts to bring about change indicate that he believed these struggles were worth it in the end.\n\nOption C: \"Life was uncertain but ultimately rewarding.\" This also has some merit. Darrow was known for his uncertainty about many things, including the afterlife, given his agnostic beliefs. However, his commitment to social justice suggests that he saw life as ultimately rewarding, especially through the positive changes he helped bring about.\n\nOption D: \"Life was meaningful for most people.\" This seems a bit too general. Darrow was aware of the suffering and inequality in society, so I doubt he thought life was meaningful for the majority of people. His work was aimed at improving the lives of those who were marginalized and oppressed.\n\nComparing options B and C, both seem plausible, but I think option B captures Darrow's view more accurately. His life's work was driven by the belief that despite hardships, life was worthwhile, and worth fighting for to make it better for others.\n\nLet me see if I can find any direct quotes or statements from Darrow that might support this choice. After a quick search, I recall that in his famous closing argument in the trial of Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb, he spoke about the influences on human behavior and the potential for rehabilitation, emphasizing the value of life and the importance of mercy.\n\nAdditionally, in his autobiography, Darrow wrote about the hardships he faced in his early life and how those experiences shaped his views on social justice. He recognized that life was tough, but he also believed in the potential for positive change and the importance of fighting for what is right.\n\nSo, based on this, I think option B, \"Life was hard but worthwhile,\" aligns best with Clarence Darrow's beliefs about life's meaning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
