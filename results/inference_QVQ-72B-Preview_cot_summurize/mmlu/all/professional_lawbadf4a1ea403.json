                    "text": "Okay, so I'm trying to understand this concept of discharge for impracticability in sales contracts. The seller is saying that something has happened that makes performing the contract really hard or maybe even impossible. And now, I have to figure out which of these options isn't correct about discharge for impracticability.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand what impracticability means in this context. In contract law, impracticability refers to a situation where performing the contract has become excessively burdensome or difficult due to some unforeseen event that wasn't the fault of the party claiming impracticability.\n\nSo, let's look at option A: \"The problem must not have been caused by the fault of the party seeking to invoke the defense.\" This seems to align with my understanding. If the seller caused the issue themselves, they can't use impracticability as an excuse not to perform the contract.\n\nOption C says: \"The failure to excuse performance would result in grave injustice.\" This also makes sense. If enforcing the contract under the new circumstances would be extremely unfair or lead to disproportionate hardship, then it might be reasonable to discharge the contract.\n\nOption D states: \"The impracticality must go to a basic assumption on which the contract was made.\" This seems similar to the idea of a fundamental change in circumstances. If a basic assumption underlying the contract has been frustrated by events beyond control, that could be a ground for discharge.\n\nNow, option B: \"A price increase is sufficient for discharge.\" Hmm, this one gives me pause. While a significant price increase might make the contract less profitable for the seller, is that alone enough to discharge the contract? I don't think so.\n\nIn standard contract law, once you've entered into a contract, you're generally obligated to perform it even if costs rise or you no longer find it profitable. There has to be something more than just a price increase to claim impracticability.\n\nI recall that courts typically require that the impracticability be due to an unforeseen event that fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations, not just a change in market prices.\n\nSo, if there's a general increase in the cost of materials or labor, that's usually considered a business risk that the contracting parties should have accounted for in the contract terms.\n\nUnless the contract specifically includes a clause that allows for adjustment or termination in case of price increases, the seller can't just walk away because it's become more expensive to perform.\n\nTherefore, I think option B is not correct because a price increase alone isn't sufficient to discharge a contract based on impracticability. There needs to be something more exceptional or extraordinary happening.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Option A: Correct, as the problem shouldn't be caused by the party's own fault.\n\n- Option C: Correct, as grave injustice is a valid consideration for discharge.\n\n- Option D: Correct, as the impracticality must relate to a basic assumption of the contract.\n\n- Option B: Incorrect, because a price increase isn't sufficient grounds on its own for discharge due to impracticability.\n\nI think that's the answer: option B is not correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
