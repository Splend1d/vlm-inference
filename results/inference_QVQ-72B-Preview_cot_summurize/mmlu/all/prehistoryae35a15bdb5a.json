                    "text": "So I've got this question about Mayan culture by 1900 B.P., which I believe means 1900 years before the present. I need to figure out which of these elements were not part of their culture at that time. The options are:\n\nA. Stratified societies ruled by kings.\n\nB. Ritual ball games and a reverence for precious jade.\n\nC. A sophisticated bronze-producing industry.\n\nD. A hieroglyphic written language and calendar.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Mayan civilization was like around 100 A.D., because if it's 1900 B.P., that would be roughly 100 A.D., give or take, depending on how you calculate the present.\n\nThe Maya were an ancient Mesoamerican civilization, known for their advanced achievements in astronomy, mathematics, and architecture. They had a complex social structure and were famous for their cities like Tikal and Chichen Itza.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Stratified societies ruled by kings.\n\nI remember that the Mayan society was indeed stratified. They had a hierarchical system with kings at the top, followed by nobles, priests, commoners, and slaves. So, this seems to be part of their culture by 1900 B.P.\n\nOption B: Ritual ball games and a reverence for precious jade.\n\nThe Mayans are famous for their ball games, which had significant ritual and religious importance. They also highly valued jade, using it for jewelry and ceremonial objects. So, this also seems to be part of their culture at that time.\n\nOption C: A sophisticated bronze-producing industry.\n\nWait a minute, I thought the Mayans were primarily known for using stone and jade, not metal like bronze. Let me double-check this. Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin, and while the Maya did use some metals like gold and copper for ornaments, I don't recall them having a sophisticated bronze-producing industry. Maybe they traded for metals with other cultures, but I don't think they were major producers of bronze.\n\nOption D: A hieroglyphic written language and calendar.\n\nThe Mayans developed a hieroglyphic writing system and were renowned for their calendars, including the famous Long Count calendar. So, this was definitely part of their culture by 1900 B.P.\n\nBased on my knowledge, it seems like option C, a sophisticated bronze-producing industry, was not part of Mayan culture by 1900 B.P. They did use some metals, but bronze production wasn't a significant part of their economy or culture.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll quickly recap:\n\n- A: Stratified societies ruled by kings \u2013 yes.\n\n- B: Ritual ball games and jade reverence \u2013 yes.\n\n- C: Sophisticated bronze-producing industry \u2013 unlikely.\n\n- D: Hieroglyphic writing and calendars \u2013 yes.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. A sophisticated bronze-producing industry.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
