                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Gamma Co., a medical products manufacturer. It says they have a 10% return on assets and an asset turnover of 4:1. I need to find the profit margin on sales. The options are 40.00%, 10.00%, 4.00%, and 0.025.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what these terms mean. Return on assets (ROA) is a measure of how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. The formula for ROA is:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nAsset turnover is a measure of how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales. The formula for asset turnover is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Asset Turnover} = \\frac{\\text{Sales}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nProfit margin is a measure of profitability, showing how much profit is made for each dollar of sales. The formula for profit margin is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Sales}} \\]\n\nSo, I have ROA and asset turnover, and I need to find profit margin.\n\nLooking at the formulas, I can see that:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\text{Profit Margin} \\times \\text{Asset Turnover} \\]\n\nThis is because:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Asset Turnover} = \\frac{\\text{Sales}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Sales}} \\]\n\nSo, substituting the second equation into the first:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Sales}} \\times \\frac{\\text{Sales}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\text{Profit Margin} \\times \\text{Asset Turnover} \\]\n\nGiven that ROA is 10% and asset turnover is 4:1 (which means 4), I can plug these values into the equation:\n\n\\[ 0.10 = \\text{Profit Margin} \\times 4 \\]\n\nNow, I can solve for profit margin:\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit Margin} = \\frac{0.10}{4} = 0.025 \\]\n\nSo, the profit margin is 0.025, which is 2.5%.\n\nLooking back at the options, 0.025 is one of the choices. But wait, the options are given as percentages or decimal numbers without units. Since profit margin is usually expressed as a percentage, 0.025 corresponds to 2.5%, which is not listed directly. However, among the options, 0.025 is present, which might be considered as 2.5%, but it's not explicitly listed in percentage form.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in my calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nGiven:\n\nROA = 10% = 0.10\n\nAsset Turnover = 4:1 = 4\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nROA = Profit Margin \u00d7 Asset Turnover\n\nSo,\n\n0.10 = Profit Margin \u00d7 4\n\nProfit Margin = 0.10 / 4 = 0.025\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider another approach. Maybe using the DuPont analysis, which breaks down ROA into profit margin and asset turnover.\n\nDuPont identity:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\text{Profit Margin} \\times \\text{Asset Turnover} \\]\n\nWhich is what I used above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to look at it, but I think the calculation is correct.\n\nSo, the profit margin is 0.025, or 2.5%. But looking at the options:\n\nA. 40.00%\n\nB. 10.00%\n\nC. 4.00%\n\nD. 0.025\n\nNone of these match 2.5%, unless 0.025 is considered the same as D. But 0.025 is 2.5%, not 0.025%.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the options are miswritten or misinterpreted. Maybe the decimal points are misplaced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that asset turnover is 4:1, meaning that for every dollar of assets, there are $4 in sales.\n\nGiven that, and ROA being 10%, let's assume total assets are $100 for simplicity.\n\nThen, sales would be 4 * $100 = $400.\n\nNet income would be ROA times total assets: 0.10 * $100 = $10.\n\nProfit margin is net income divided by sales: $10 / $400 = 0.025, or 2.5%.\n\nAgain, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different definition of profit margin or asset turnover that I'm not considering.\n\nWait, maybe the asset turnover is not sales to assets, but assets to sales. But no, asset turnover is typically sales to assets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the profit margin is defined differently, like operating profit margin or something else, but the question specifies net income.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The calculation seems straightforward: ROA = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover.\n\nGiven ROA = 10% = 0.10\n\nAsset Turnover = 4\n\nProfit Margin = 0.10 / 4 = 0.025\n\nSo, the answer should be 0.025, which corresponds to option D.\n\nEven though it's 2.5%, and the options are given without units, it's likely that 0.025 is the correct choice.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 0.025.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
