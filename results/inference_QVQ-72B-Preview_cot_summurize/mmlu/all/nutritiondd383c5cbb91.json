                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these statements about adolescence is correct. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst option: Brain growth is faster than at any other stage in life. Hmm, I thought that the brain grows really quickly in early childhood, like during infancy and toddlerhood. In fact, I think that by the age of three, the brain is already about 80% of its adult size. So, during adolescence, which starts around puberty, I don't think brain growth is faster than in early childhood. Maybe it continues to develop, but not necessarily grow in size as quickly. So, I'm a bit skeptical about this one.\n\nSecond option: Peak bone mass occurs before the growth spurt ends. I remember learning that during puberty, there's a rapid growth in height, which is the growth spurt. Bone density increases during this time, but I think that peak bone mass is usually reached in young adulthood, maybe around the age of 20 to 30. So, it's after the growth spurt has ended, not before. So, this statement seems incorrect.\n\nThird option: Girls physiologically increase their percentage body fat. Okay, so during puberty, boys and girls go through different changes due to hormones. In girls, estrogen leads to the development of secondary sexual characteristics, which include an increase in body fat percentage. This is normal and helps prepare their bodies for potential pregnancy and childbirth later on. So, this seems accurate.\n\nFourth option: Type 2 obesity-related diabetes remains a very rare problem. Well, type 2 diabetes used to be primarily seen in adults, but with the rise in obesity rates among children and adolescents, it's becoming more common in younger age groups. So, while it might not be as prevalent as in adults, it's certainly not a rare problem anymore. Therefore, this statement is probably incorrect.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option C seems to be the correct one. Girls physiologically increase their percentage body fat during adolescence due to hormonal changes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
