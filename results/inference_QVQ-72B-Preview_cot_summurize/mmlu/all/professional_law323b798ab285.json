I need to figure out whether this ordinance is constitutional or not, based on the options provided.\n\nFirst, let's understand the background. The bus company has a certificate from the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) that allows it to operate passenger buses to major cities on the east coast. This certificate is issued under a federal statute and is called a certificate of convenience and necessity. Importantly, this certificate doesn't specify particular highways, streets, or locations for the bus service. So, the company has some flexibility in where they operate, as long as they're serving the major cities.\n\nThe company prides itself on picking up and delivering passengers at the center of each city they serve, which is a key part of their marketing strategy against airlines and railroads, especially for short-haul trips that generate a lot of their revenue.\n\nNow, the city in question has passed an ordinance that:\n\n1. Prohibits all trucks and buses from operating in a five-square-mile central business area, called \"center city,\" between 10:00 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. on weekdays.\n\n2. Prohibits all on-street parking of passenger automobiles in the same area and during the same hours.\n\nThe company's bus station is located right in the heart of this center city area. According to their schedules, over 75 buses either enter or leave this station during those restricted hours each weekday.\n\nGiven this, the company is suing to challenge the constitutionality of this ordinance. I need to determine which of the provided options is the most likely outcome.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Constitutional, because it is within the city's police power to regulate transportation services in the center city business district.\n\nPolice power refers to the authority of a government to regulate the conduct of its citizens for the promotion of health, safety, morals, and general welfare. Cities often have police powers to regulate activities within their boundaries for these purposes.\n\nIn this case, the city is trying to relieve traffic congestion and air pollution, which are legitimate concerns for public welfare. So, on the surface, this seems like a valid exercise of police power.\n\nHowever, there might be limitations to this power when it comes to regulating interstate commerce, which is regulated by the federal government.\n\nB. Constitutional, because it is a valid exercise of municipal regulation in the area of intrastate commerce.\n\nIntrastate commerce refers to business activities that occur entirely within one state's boundaries. However, since the bus company operates between states (interstate commerce), this ordinance might affect interstate commerce, which is regulated by the federal government.\n\nThe ICC has issued a certificate for the company to operate interstate bus services, and this city ordinance could potentially interfere with those operations.\n\nSo, while municipalities can regulate intrastate commerce, they generally cannot unduly burden interstate commerce.\n\nC. Unconstitutional, because it violates the dormant commerce clause.\n\nThe dormant commerce clause is a doctrine derived from the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits states from passing legislation that improperly burdens or discriminates against interstate commerce.\n\nIn this case, the ordinance specifically targets trucks and buses, which are likely involved in interstate commerce, by restricting their operations during certain hours in the city center.\n\nMoreover, the bus company's operations are directly impacted since their bus station is in the restricted area, and many of their buses operate during the restricted hours.\n\nThis could be seen as an undue burden on interstate commerce, especially since the restrictions apply only to trucks and buses, potentially discriminating against them in favor of passenger automobiles.\n\nD. Unconstitutional, because the ordinance is discriminatory per se.\n\n\"Discriminatory per se\" generally refers to laws that are discriminatory on their face, without any legitimate governmental interest.\n\nIn this case, the ordinance discriminates between different types of vehicles: trucks and buses versus passenger automobiles.\n\nHowever, the ordinance applies equally to all trucks and buses, regardless of whether they are engaged in interstate or intrastate commerce.\n\nAdditionally, the ordinance is aimed at relieving traffic congestion and air pollution, which are legitimate public interests.\n\nTherefore, while it does discriminate between types of vehicles, it may not be discriminatory per se if there is a rational basis for the discrimination.\n\nNow, considering all this, I need to decide which option is the most likely outcome.\n\nOption A suggests that the ordinance is constitutional because it's within the city's police power. However, as I thought earlier, there might be conflicts with federal regulation of interstate commerce.\n\nOption B says it's constitutional as a valid exercise of municipal regulation in intrastate commerce. But again, since the bus company is involved in interstate commerce, this might not fully address the issue.\n\nOption C argues that it's unconstitutional because it violates the dormant commerce clause. This seems plausible because the ordinance could be seen as burdening interstate commerce by restricting the operations of buses that operate across state lines.\n\nOption D claims it's unconstitutional because it's discriminatory per se. While the ordinance does discriminate between types of vehicles, it's not necessarily discriminatory per se if there's a rational basis for the distinction.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think Option C is the most likely outcome. The ordinance appears to violate the dormant commerce clause by imposing restrictions on interstate commerce without a sufficient countervailing benefit to local interests.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether the city's interests in reducing traffic congestion and air pollution are sufficient to outweigh the burden on interstate commerce.\n\nIn general, local regulations that affect interstate commerce are permissible if they serve a legitimate local purpose that cannot be achieved through reasonable alternative means that would less burden interstate commerce.\n\nIn this case, the city has a legitimate interest in reducing traffic and pollution, but the restriction on buses and trucks during specific hours might overly burden interstate commerce, especially since the bus company's operations are significantly impacted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other measures the city could take that would achieve the same goals without burdening interstate commerce as much, such as implementing congestion pricing, designating specific lanes for buses, or adjusting the restricted hours to minimize impact on the bus company's operations.\n\nGiven that, it seems that the ordinance might be struck down as violating the dormant commerce clause.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the city can justify these restrictions because buses and trucks contribute disproportionately to traffic congestion and pollution compared to passenger automobiles.\n\nIf that's the case, then maybe the ordinance is not necessarily violating the dormant commerce clause, as it's targeting the source of the problem.\n\nHowever, I need to consider whether such a distinction is permissible under the dormant commerce clause.\n\nThere are cases where the Supreme Court has allowed regulations that incidentally affect interstate commerce if they serve a legitimate local purpose and the burden on interstate commerce is not excessive.\n\nFor example, in Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., the Court balanced the burden on interstate commerce against the local benefits and concluded that the regulation was unconstitutional because the burden outweighed the benefits.\n\nApplying that test here, we'd need to weigh the burden on the bus company's interstate operations against the city's interests in reducing traffic and pollution.\n\nGiven that the bus company's operations are significantly disrupted, and that there may be alternative ways to achieve the city's goals with less impact on interstate commerce, it's possible that the ordinance would be struck down.\n\nTherefore, Option C seems the most appropriate choice.\n\nBut let's consider Option D again. Is the ordinance discriminatory per se?\n\nDiscriminatory per se typically refers to classifications that are inherently unfair or irrational.\n\nIn this case, the ordinance discriminates between trucks and buses on one hand and passenger automobiles on the other.\n\nHowever, this discrimination might be based on rational grounds, such as the different impacts of these vehicle types on traffic and pollution.\n\nTherefore, it's not necessarily discriminatory per se, as there is a rational basis for the distinction.\n\nConsequently, Option D is less likely to be the correct choice.\n\nBetween Options A and B, which claim the ordinance is constitutional, and Options C and D, which claim it's unconstitutional, I believe Option C is the strongest argument based on the information provided.\n\nThus, the court will most likely declare the ordinance unconstitutional because it violates the dormant commerce clause.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nC"
