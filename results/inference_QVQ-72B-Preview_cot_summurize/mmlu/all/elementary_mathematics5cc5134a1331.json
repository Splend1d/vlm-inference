                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this number pattern starting with 28, and each next number is obtained by adding 14 to the previous one. So, the sequence goes like: 28, 42, 56, 70, and so on.\n\nThe question is asking which statement is true about all the numbers in this pattern. The options are:\n\nA. All the numbers can be divided equally by 10.\n\nB. All the numbers can be divided equally by 4.\n\nC. All the numbers can be divided equally by 8.\n\nD. All the numbers can be divided equally by 7.\n\nOkay, so I need to check which of these divisors applies to every number in the pattern.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand the pattern. It starts at 28 and increases by 14 each time. So, the general term of the pattern can be expressed as:\n\nTerm(n) = 28 + 14*(n-1)\n\nWhere n is the position in the pattern starting from 1.\n\nLet me verify this with the first few terms:\n\n- For n=1: 28 + 14*(1-1) = 28 + 0 = 28 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- For n=2: 28 + 14*(2-1) = 28 + 14 = 42 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- For n=3: 28 + 14*(3-1) = 28 + 28 = 56 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- For n=4: 28 + 14*(4-1) = 28 + 42 = 70 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSeems correct.\n\nNow, I need to check divisibility for each option.\n\nOption A: Divisible by 10\n\nLooking at the terms:\n\n28 \u00f7 10 = 2.8 \u2192 not divisible\n\n42 \u00f7 10 = 4.2 \u2192 not divisible\n\n56 \u00f7 10 = 5.6 \u2192 not divisible\n\n70 \u00f7 10 = 7 \u2192 divisible\n\nSo, not all terms are divisible by 10. Therefore, option A is false.\n\nOption B: Divisible by 4\n\n28 \u00f7 4 = 7 \u2192 divisible\n\n42 \u00f7 4 = 10.5 \u2192 not divisible\n\nSo, not all terms are divisible by 4. Option B is false.\n\nOption C: Divisible by 8\n\n28 \u00f7 8 = 3.5 \u2192 not divisible\n\n42 \u00f7 8 = 5.25 \u2192 not divisible\n\n56 \u00f7 8 = 7 \u2192 divisible\n\n70 \u00f7 8 = 8.75 \u2192 not divisible\n\nNot all terms are divisible by 8. Option C is false.\n\nOption D: Divisible by 7\n\n28 \u00f7 7 = 4 \u2192 divisible\n\n42 \u00f7 7 = 6 \u2192 divisible\n\n56 \u00f7 7 = 8 \u2192 divisible\n\n70 \u00f7 7 = 10 \u2192 divisible\n\nHmm, so far, all checked terms are divisible by 7. But to be sure, I should check more terms or find a general rule.\n\nLet's check the next term, n=5:\n\nTerm(5) = 28 + 14*(5-1) = 28 + 56 = 84\n\n84 \u00f7 7 = 12 \u2192 divisible\n\nNext, n=6:\n\nTerm(6) = 28 + 14*5 = 28 + 70 = 98\n\n98 \u00f7 7 = 14 \u2192 divisible\n\nSeems like all terms are divisible by 7.\n\nBut wait, is there a general reason why this should be true?\n\nLet's see the general term: 28 + 14*(n-1)\n\nI know that 14 is divisible by 7, since 14 = 7*2\n\nSimilarly, 28 is divisible by 7, since 28 = 7*4\n\nSo, Term(n) = 28 + 14*(n-1) = 7*4 + 7*2*(n-1) = 7*(4 + 2*(n-1))\n\nNo matter what n is, the term is a multiple of 7 because it's 7 multiplied by an integer (4 + 2*(n-1))\n\nTherefore, every term in the pattern is divisible by 7.\n\nI think that's the answer: D. All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 7.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other divisor that would fit all terms.\n\nIs there any other number that divides 28 and 14?\n\nWell, 28 and 14 are both divisible by 1, 2, 7, and 14.\n\nBut option D is 7, and from the general term, it seems 7 is the correct choice.\n\nAlternatively, 14 could be considered, but it's not listed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
