It's pretty involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, there's a riot in the city, and during this riot, many shops are looted and some are burned. The defendant is walking along the street and picks up a portable television set that's lying on the sidewalk outside an appliance store. A police officer sees this and arrests the defendant. He's charged with grand larceny, which is a felony that can carry up to seven months in prison and a $1,000 fine.\n\nAt his arraignment, the judge tells the defendant about his right to have an attorney appointed for him since he's indigent (meaning he can't afford one). But the defendant says he wants to represent himself and waive his right to a jury trial. The judge questions him extensively about this decision. The defendant admits he has no legal experience and says he doesn't trust lawyers, which is why he doesn't want one appointed.\n\nThe judge isn't convinced by the defendant's reasons for self-representation and appoints an attorney anyway. The attorney then tells the court that the defendant still wants a non-jury trial. However, the prosecution requests that a jury be impaneled, and the court agrees, so a jury is selected.\n\nThe defendant is eventually convicted by the jury and sentenced to six months in prison. Additionally, he's ordered to reimburse the state $450 to cover the cost of his attorney. This reimbursement is based on a statute that was in effect at the time of his arrest.\n\nNow, the defendant is appealing both his conviction and the reimbursement order. The question is, what should the appellate court do?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Affirm both the conviction and the reimbursement order.\n\nB. Affirm the conviction but not the reimbursement order.\n\nC. Reverse the conviction because he was denied the right to a non-jury trial, but not the reimbursement order.\n\nD. Reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was denied the right to represent himself.\n\nOkay, so there are a few key issues here: the right to self-representation, the right to a non-jury trial, and the reimbursement order.\n\nFirst, let's talk about the right to self-representation. In the United States, the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution guarantees the right to counsel in criminal prosecutions, but it also implies the right to self-representation. The Supreme Court recognized this in the case of Faretta v. California (1975), where it held that defendants have a constitutional right to represent themselves in criminal trials if they choose to do so, provided they make a knowing and voluntary waiver of their right to counsel.\n\nIn this case, the defendant expressed a clear desire to represent himself and waive his right to a jury trial. However, the judge appointed an attorney anyway because he didn't find the defendant's reasons persuasive, despite the defendant having no legal experience.\n\nSo, the question is, did the judge properly handle the defendant's request for self-representation?\n\nAccording to Faretta, a defendant has the right to self-representation if they knowingly and voluntarily waive their right to counsel. The judge must ensure that the defendant understands the disadvantages of self-representation and that the waiver is made with an appreciation of the likely consequences.\n\nIn this case, the judge questioned the defendant at length about his demands, and the defendant admitted to having no legal experience and not trusting lawyers. The judge didn't find these reasons persuasive and appointed an attorney.\n\nBut according to Faretta, the judge can't deny self-representation just because the defendant doesn't have legal experience or because the judge thinks it's a bad idea. The defendant must be allowed to make that choice if it's knowingly and voluntarily made.\n\nSo, it seems like the judge may have erred in denying the defendant's request for self-representation.\n\nNow, moving on to the right to a non-jury trial. In federal courts and many state courts, defendants have the right to waive their right to a jury trial and opt for a trial by judge instead. This is known as a bench trial.\n\nHowever, in some jurisdictions, the prosecution must consent to a waiver of the jury trial right. So, if the prosecution objects, the defendant can't have a bench trial.\n\nIn this case, the defendant wanted a non-jury trial, but the prosecution requested a jury trial, and the court impaneled a jury.\n\nSo, depending on the specific rules of the jurisdiction, the prosecution's consent might be required for waiving the jury trial.\n\nIf the jurisdiction requires prosecution consent, then the court's decision to have a jury trial despite the defendant's waiver would be proper.\n\nBut if the jurisdiction allows defendants to waive the jury trial without prosecution consent, then the court may have erred in impaneling a jury against the defendant's wishes.\n\nI need to know more about the specific rules of the jurisdiction to make a definitive judgment on this point.\n\nLastly, there's the reimbursement order. The defendant was ordered to reimburse the state $450 for the cost of his attorney. This was based on a statute in effect at the time of his arrest.\n\nThe question is whether this reimbursement is permissible under the law.\n\nGenerally, when an indigent defendant is provided with appointed counsel, there may be provisions for reimbursement if the defendant is convicted and has the ability to pay.\n\nHowever, such reimbursement orders must be made in accordance with the law and must consider the defendant's ability to pay.\n\nIf the statute allows for reimbursement and the defendant has the means to pay, then the order might be valid.\n\nBut if the defendant is truly indigent and lacks the financial means to pay, then ordering reimbursement could be seen as punitive or beyond the defendant's ability.\n\nMoreover, imposing financial penalties without considering the defendant's ability to pay could violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nAdditionally, there's precedent in cases like Williams v. Illinois (1970), where the Supreme Court held that a state cannot constitutionally imprison a person for his inability to pay a fine imposed as part of his sentence unless the state determines that the failure to pay is willful.\n\nSo, in this case, since the defendant is indigent, ordering him to pay $450 without considering his ability to pay might be problematic.\n\nPutting it all together, the appellate court needs to consider whether:\n\n1. The defendant's right to self-representation was violated.\n\n2. The defendant's right to waive a jury trial was improperly denied.\n\n3. The reimbursement order was appropriate given the defendant's indigent status.\n\nGiven that, let's look back at the options:\n\nA. Affirm both the conviction and the reimbursement order.\n\nB. Affirm the conviction but not the reimbursement order.\n\nC. Reverse the conviction because he was denied the right to a non-jury trial, but not the reimbursement order.\n\nD. Reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was denied the right to represent himself.\n\nFrom what I can gather, the primary issue seems to be the denial of the defendant's right to self-representation.\n\nIf the court improperly denied self-representation, that would be a violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights, which could be grounds for reversing the conviction.\n\nAdditionally, if the court improperly denied the defendant's right to a non-jury trial, that could also be a basis for reversal, depending on the jurisdiction's rules.\n\nLastly, the reimbursement order might be invalid if the defendant is truly indigent and lacks the ability to pay.\n\nGiven that, option D seems the most comprehensive, as it suggests reversing both the conviction and the reimbursement order based on the denial of the right to self-representation.\n\nHowever, I need to consider whether the denial of self-representation is sufficient to reverse the entire conviction or if there are other factors at play.\n\nIn Faretta v. California, the Supreme Court held that the right to self-representation is a fundamental right that must be honored when a defendant makes a knowing and voluntary waiver of the right to counsel.\n\nIf the judge denied this right without proper cause, it could be a reversible error.\n\nMoreover, if the defendant was forced to have an attorney against his will, that could affect the entire trial process and thus require reversal of the conviction.\n\nAs for the reimbursement order, if it's based on a statute that allows for recovery of attorney costs from indigent defendants upon conviction, and if the defendant has the means to pay, it might be valid.\n\nBut if the defendant is truly indigent and lacks the ability to pay, then ordering reimbursement could be seen as an unconstitutional financial penalty.\n\nGiven that, it's possible that the reimbursement order should also be reversed, especially if the defendant can't afford to pay.\n\nTherefore, option D seems the most appropriate choice: reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was denied the right to represent himself.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether the denial of the non-jury trial also warrants reversal.\n\nIf the jurisdiction requires prosecution consent to waive a jury trial, and the prosecution objected, then the court's decision to have a jury trial was proper.\n\nBut if the jurisdiction allows defendants to waive the jury without prosecution consent, then denying the waiver could be error.\n\nWithout knowing the specific rules of the jurisdiction, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nBut since the primary and clear violation appears to be the denial of self-representation, and that alone could be sufficient grounds for reversal, I'll lean towards option D.\n\nAdditionally, the reimbursement order seems problematic given the defendant's indigent status, so it should also be reversed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was denied the right to represent himself.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
