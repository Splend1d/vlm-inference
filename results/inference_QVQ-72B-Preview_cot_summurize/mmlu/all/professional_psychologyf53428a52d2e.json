                    "text": "So I've got this question here about a ten-year-old boy who took an intelligence test and scored 130. Then, two years later, he took an alternate form of the same test. The question is asking what his most likely score would be on the second testing. The options are:\n\nA. more than 130\n\nB. less than 130\n\nC. 130\n\nD. 130, but with a different pattern of subtest scores\n\nAlright, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an IQ score represents. IQ stands for Intelligence Quotient, and it's a measure of cognitive abilities compared to peers of the same age. A score of 100 is considered average, and deviations from that are measured in standard deviations. Typically, IQ scores follow a normal distribution, with about 68% of people scoring between 85 and 115, 95% between 70 and 130, and so on.\n\nNow, this boy scored 130 at age ten. Let's see what that means. If the average IQ is 100, and a standard deviation is usually around 15 points, then 130 would be about two standard deviations above the mean. That places him in the gifted range.\n\nBut wait, he's being retested two years later with an alternate form of the same test. I need to consider a few things here:\n\n1. **Test-retest reliability:** This refers to how consistent a test is when administered multiple times. If a test has high reliability, a person's score should be similar across administrations.\n\n2. **Alternate form reliability:** Since it's an alternate form, we need to ensure that the alternate form is equally reliable and measures the same constructs as the original test.\n\n3. **Changes over time:** Cognitive abilities can change over time, especially in children, as they develop and learn new things.\n\n4. **Practice effects:** Having taken the test before, the boy might perform better on the second test just because he's more familiar with the format, even if it's an alternate form.\n\n5. **Motivation and test-taking conditions:** These can affect scores. If the boy is more motivated or less anxious the second time around, he might score higher, or vice versa.\n\nGiven that it's an alternate form, the content might be different, but it's designed to measure the same overall construct, so in theory, his score should be comparable.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the most likely score on the second testing. Options A and D suggest he will score higher than 130, but with D specifying that it's still 130 but with a different pattern of subtest scores.\n\nWait a minute, option D says \"130, but with a different pattern of subtest scores.\" That implies that his overall IQ score remains the same, but his performance across different subtests has changed. This is possible because people can improve in some areas and not others over time.\n\nBut the question is asking for the obtained score, which is likely referring to the overall IQ score, not the pattern of subtest scores.\n\nSo, if the test has good reliability, and assuming no significant changes in his cognitive abilities over two years, his score should be around 130 again.\n\nBut, in reality, IQ scores can fluctuate somewhat from test to test, even with reliable tests, due to measurement error.\n\nStatistically, there's a phenomenon called \"regression to the mean,\" which suggests that if someone scores extremely high (or low) on one test, they are likely to score closer to the average on the next test.\n\nSo, in this case, since he scored 130, which is above average, there might be a tendency for his next score to be closer to 100, which would mean slightly lower than 130.\n\nHowever, with a reliable test and considering that he's only two years older, his score might not change that much.\n\nMoreover, considering that it's an alternate form, which is designed to measure the same construct with similar reliability, his score should be comparable.\n\nBut the question is phrased to ask for the \"most likely\" score, which suggests considering the probabilities.\n\nGiven that, and considering regression to the mean, option B (\"less than 130\") might seem plausible.\n\nHowever, I need to think carefully. Regression to the mean suggests that an extreme score is likely to be followed by a less extreme score, but this doesn't necessarily mean it will be lower; it could be higher if the original score was below average.\n\nIn this case, since the original score was above average, regression to the mean would suggest a score closer to 100, which would be lower than 130.\n\nBut, IQ tests are designed to be reliable, and if the test-retest reliability is high, we would expect the score to remain similar.\n\nAdditionally, in a ten-year-old, cognitive abilities are still developing, so it's possible that with age and education, his score could increase.\n\nHowever, without specific information on the reliability of the test or the typical stability of IQ scores over two years for this age group, it's hard to be certain.\n\nLet me consider some research knowledge. Longitudinal studies have shown that IQ scores in children can be fairly stable, especially after early childhood. The correlation between IQ scores at different ages tends to increase as the time between measurements decreases.\n\nGiven that only two years have passed between tests, the correlation should be quite high, meaning that the boy is likely to score similarly on both tests.\n\nMoreover, practice effects could lead to a higher score on the second test, as he might be more familiar with the test format and less anxious.\n\nOn the other hand, using an alternate form might minimize practice effects, as the content is different, although the format is similar.\n\nConsidering all this, I think that the most likely outcome is that his score remains around 130.\n\nTherefore, option C (\"130\") seems the most plausible answer.\n\nBut let's look at option D: \"130, but with a different pattern of subtest scores.\"\n\nThis is possible because even if his overall IQ score remains the same, his performance on different subtests might change over time.\n\nFor example, his verbal comprehension might have improved more than his perceptual reasoning, or vice versa.\n\nHowever, the question is specifically about the obtained score, which is likely the full-scale IQ score, not the subtest scores.\n\nSo, even if his subtest patterns change, his overall IQ score might still be 130.\n\nTherefore, option C is still the best answer.\n\nI think the correct answer is C. 130.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
