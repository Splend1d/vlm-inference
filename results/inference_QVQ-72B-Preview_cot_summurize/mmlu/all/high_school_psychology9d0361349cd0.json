                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about schizophrenia. It says that all of the following are positive symptoms of schizophrenia EXCEPT, and then it lists four options: A. auditory hallucinations, B. visual hallucinations, C. paranoid delusions, and D. flat affect. I need to pick the one that's not a positive symptom.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia are. I think positive symptoms are like additions or excesses of normal behavior, like hearing voices or having strange beliefs, while negative symptoms are deficits or reductions in normal behavior, like showing less emotion or having trouble speaking.\n\nSo, positive symptoms include things like hallucinations and delusions, right? Let's see, auditory hallucinations are when someone hears voices or sounds that aren't really there. That sounds like a positive symptom because it's an extra perception that shouldn't be there.\n\nVisual hallucinations would be seeing things that aren't really there, which is also an excess perception, so that should be a positive symptom too.\n\nParanoid delusions are false beliefs that someone is being persecuted or plotted against. That's a type of thought disorder, which is another positive symptom.\n\nNow, flat affect seems different. It's when a person shows little or no emotion, either on their face or in their voice. That sounds like a reduction in normal emotional expression, which would make it a negative symptom rather than a positive one.\n\nSo, based on that, options A, B, and C are positive symptoms, while D is a negative symptom. Therefore, the answer should be D. flat affect.\n\nWait, just to make sure, I'll double-check. Positive symptoms are things that are added or increased abnormally, like hallucinations and delusions, whereas negative symptoms are things that are decreased or absent, like flat affect or social withdrawal.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. So, flat affect is indeed a negative symptom, and thus the exception here.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
