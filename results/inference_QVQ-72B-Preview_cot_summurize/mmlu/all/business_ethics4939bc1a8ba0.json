                    "text": "So I've got this question here about corporations, and I need to figure out which option correctly describes them. The question is saying that a corporation is ________ from its managers, employees, investors, and customers. And then it says it has _______ succession and also _________. And the options are combinations of words like indistinguishable or independent, perpetual or limited, and whether it owns its own assets or not.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a corporation to be \"indistinguishable\" or \"independent\" from its managers, employees, investors, and customers. Let me think about what a corporation is. A corporation is a legal entity that's separate from the people who own it, run it, or do business with it. So, it's its own distinct legal person, right? That suggests that it's independent from its managers, employees, investors, and customers because those are all separate entities.\n\nIndistinguishable seems like the opposite\u2014it would mean that you can't tell the corporation apart from these other entities. But that doesn't make much sense because the whole point of a corporation is that it's separate. So, I think \"independent\" is the right choice here.\n\nNext, it says the corporation has _______ succession. The options are \"perpetual\" or \"limited.\" Succession refers to the passing on of ownership or management. A corporation is known for having perpetual succession, meaning that it can continue to exist indefinitely, regardless of changes in its ownership or management. So, even if the owners or managers change, the corporation itself goes on. That's one of its key features. So, \"perpetual\" seems correct here.\n\nLastly, it says the corporation _________. The options are \"does not own its own assets\" or \"owns its own assets.\" Again, because a corporation is a separate legal entity, it can own property and assets in its own name. So, it does own its own assets. That makes sense because if it's its own entity, it should be able to buy, sell, and own things independently.\n\nPutting it all together, the correct option should be C: Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets.\n\nLet me just double-check. Option A says \"Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Does not own its own assets.\" That doesn't seem right because a corporation is supposed to be distinguishable and does own its assets. Option B says \"Independent, Limited, Owns its own assets.\" But limited succession would imply that the corporation has a set lifespan, which isn't the case; corporations have perpetual succession. Option D is \"Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Owns its own assets,\" which again, indistinguishable doesn't seem right.\n\nSo, yeah, I think C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
