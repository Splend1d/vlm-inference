                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these options is the best example of a negative externality and how to eliminate it. First, I need to understand what a negative externality is. From what I remember, an externality is when the production or consumption of a good or service affects someone who isn't directly involved in the transaction. If it's negative, it means that it's imposing a cost on others.\n\nSo, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Air pollution from a factory blows downwind and harms children in a small community. The plan is to tax the citizens of the community.\n\nHmm, air pollution is definitely a negative externality because the factory is producing something that's harming people who aren't directly involved in the production process. But taxing the citizens seems off. The citizens are the ones being harmed, so why should they be taxed? Maybe this isn't the right approach.\n\nOption B: Your neighbor plants a fragrant blooming cherry tree in her front yard. The plan is to give a tree subsidy to your neighbor.\n\nWait, a fragrant blooming cherry tree sounds nice. It probably provides a positive externality, like pleasant smells and maybe even increases property values. So, in this case, a subsidy might encourage more of such beneficial activities. But the question is about negative externalities, so this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nOption C: The waste from a hog farm pollutes a neighbor's drinking water. The plan is to give a subsidy to the hog farmer.\n\nPolluting a neighbor's drinking water is clearly a negative externality. The hog farmer is imposing costs on others by polluting their water. But giving a subsidy to the hog farmer seems counterintuitive. A subsidy might encourage more production, which could lead to more pollution. That doesn't seem like a good way to eliminate the negative externality.\n\nOption D: Air pollution from a power plant is blowing downwind and harming the trees in your community. The plan is to tax the production of electricity.\n\nAgain, air pollution is a negative externality because it's affecting the community's trees, which are not directly involved in the production of electricity. Taxing electricity production could be a way to internalize the externality, meaning making the producer pay for the environmental damage caused. This could encourage the power plant to reduce pollution or find cleaner ways to produce electricity.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, D seems to be the most appropriate example of a negative externality and a plan to eliminate it. In A, taxing the citizens who are already harmed doesn't make much sense. In B, it's a positive externality. In C, subsidizing the polluter might make the problem worse. Therefore, D is the best choice here.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about what an optimal solution would look like for each scenario.\n\nIn A, if a factory is causing air pollution that harms children, the appropriate plan would be to tax the factory based on the pollution it produces, not the citizens. This way, the factory has an incentive to reduce pollution.\n\nIn B, since the neighbor's tree provides a positive externality, maybe a subsidy to encourage more such trees could be appropriate, but since the question is about negative externalities, this isn't the right fit.\n\nIn C, if a hog farm is polluting a neighbor's water, a subsidy to the farmer might not help; instead, perhaps a tax on the pollution or regulations to prevent such pollution would be more appropriate.\n\nIn D, taxing electricity production based on the pollution emitted could be an effective way to reduce the negative externality.\n\nSo, yeah, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
