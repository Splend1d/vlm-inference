                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: find the other solution to the equation \\((x - p)(x - q) = (r - p)(r - q)\\), given that one solution is \\(x = r\\). The options are A. pqr, B. pq - r, C. p - q - r, D. p + q - r.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I know that if \\(x = r\\) is a solution to the equation, then plugging \\(x = r\\) into the equation should make it true. So let's try that to see what's going on.\n\nPlugging \\(x = r\\) into the left side: \\((r - p)(r - q)\\), and the right side is already \\((r - p)(r - q)\\). So it checks out that \\(x = r\\) is indeed a solution.\n\nNow, I need to find the other solution. Since it's a quadratic equation in terms of \\(x\\), it should have two solutions in total. Given that one is \\(x = r\\), the other should be something else.\n\nMaybe I can expand both sides and see if I can solve for \\(x\\).\n\nLet's expand the left side:\n\n\\((x - p)(x - q) = x^2 - (p + q)x + pq\\)\n\nAnd the right side:\n\n\\((r - p)(r - q) = r^2 - (p + q)r + pq\\)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\(x^2 - (p + q)x + pq = r^2 - (p + q)r + pq\\)\n\nNow, subtract \\(r^2 - (p + q)r + pq\\) from both sides to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\(x^2 - (p + q)x + pq - r^2 + (p + q)r - pq = 0\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(x^2 - (p + q)x - r^2 + (p + q)r = 0\\)\n\nHmm, the pq terms cancel out, which is interesting.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n\\(x^2 - (p + q)x - r^2 + (p + q)r = 0\\)\n\nMaybe I can factor this quadratic equation or use the quadratic formula to find the solutions.\n\nFirst, let's write it in standard form:\n\n\\(x^2 - (p + q)x + [(p + q)r - r^2] = 0\\)\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\n\\(x^2 - (p + q)x - r(r - (p + q)) = 0\\)\n\nNot sure if that helps. Maybe using the quadratic formula would be more straightforward.\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\(x = \\frac{(p + q) \\pm \\sqrt{(p + q)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot [ (p + q)r - r^2 ]}}{2}\\)\n\nLet's compute the discriminant:\n\n\\(\\delta = (p + q)^2 - 4 \\cdot [ (p + q)r - r^2 ]\\)\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n\\(\\delta = (p + q)^2 - 4(p + q)r + 4r^2\\)\n\nWait, that looks familiar. It's similar to the expansion of \\((a - b)^2\\), where \\(a = p + q\\) and \\(b = 2r\\):\n\n\\((p + q)^2 - 4(p + q)r + 4r^2 = (p + q - 2r)^2\\)\n\nSo, \\(\\delta = (p + q - 2r)^2\\)\n\nThat's great because the square root of \\(\\delta\\) is just \\(p + q - 2r\\).\n\nTherefore, the solutions are:\n\n\\(x = \\frac{(p + q) \\pm (p + q - 2r)}{2}\\)\n\nNow, let's compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst solution:\n\n\\(x = \\frac{(p + q) + (p + q - 2r)}{2} = \\frac{2p + 2q - 2r}{2} = p + q - r\\)\n\nSecond solution:\n\n\\(x = \\frac{(p + q) - (p + q - 2r)}{2} = \\frac{2r}{2} = r\\)\n\nSo, the solutions are \\(x = r\\) and \\(x = p + q - r\\).\n\nGiven that \\(x = r\\) is already known, the other solution is \\(x = p + q - r\\), which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut wait, let me check if both solutions satisfy the original equation.\n\nFirst, plug in \\(x = r\\):\n\n\\((r - p)(r - q) = (r - p)(r - q)\\), which holds true.\n\nNow, plug in \\(x = p + q - r\\):\n\n\\(( (p + q - r) - p )( (p + q - r) - q ) = (r - p)(r - q)\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\((q - r)(p - r) = (r - p)(r - q)\\)\n\nNote that \\((q - r) = -(r - q)\\) and \\((p - r) = -(r - p)\\), so:\n\n\\(-(r - q)(r - p) = (r - p)(r - q)\\), which also holds true.\n\nTherefore, both solutions are valid.\n\nSo, the other solution is \\(x = p + q - r\\), which is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{p+q-r} \\]"
