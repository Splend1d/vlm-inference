I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I know that fractions represent parts of a whole. So, 3/4 means three out of four equal parts. But how do I convert this to a decimal?\n\nOne way I've learned is to divide the numerator by the denominator. So, 3 divided by 4. Let's try that.\n\nLet me set up the division: 4 goes into 3 how many times? Well, 4 is bigger than 3, so it goes 0 times. So, I'll add a decimal point and a zero to make it 30. Now, 4 goes into 30 how many times? 4 times 7 is 28, and 30 minus 28 is 2. So, remainder is 2.\n\nNow, I add another zero to make it 20. 4 goes into 20 five times exactly, because 4 times 5 is 20. So, no remainder this time.\n\nSo, the decimal is 0.75. That seems straightforward. So, option C. 0.75 should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but is there another way to think about it? Maybe using equivalents fractions or something.\n\nWell, I know that 3/4 is the same as 75/100 because if I multiply both numerator and denominator by 25, 3*25=75 and 4*25=100. So, 3/4 is equal to 75/100, which is the same as 0.75 in decimal form. That matches what I got from division.\n\nLet me just double-check if any of the other options could possibly be right. Option A is 0.25, which is 1/4, so that's not right. Option B is 0.5, which is 1/2, not 3/4. Option D is 0.9, which is higher than 3/4, but 3/4 is less than 1, and 0.9 is also less than 1, but 3/4 is 0.75, which is less than 0.9.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty confident that 0.75 is the correct decimal equivalent of 3/4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
