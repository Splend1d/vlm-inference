                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these propositions isn't a self-evident one according to Aquinas. First off, I need to understand what a self-evident proposition is. From what I recall, a self-evident proposition is one that's true on its own, without needing any proof or explanation. It's just obviously true to anyone who understands what it's saying.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. \"Every whole is greater than its part.\"\n\nThis seems pretty straightforward. If you have a whole thing and you divide it into parts, each part should be smaller than the whole, right? So, this feels like a self-evident truth. But maybe there are some exceptions or nuances I'm missing.\n\nB. \"The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us.\"\n\nThis one seems different right away. It's a poetic or religious statement, probably from a hymn or scripture. It's expressing a spiritual belief or experience rather than a universal truth about reality. So, unlike the first option, which is a general principle about wholes and parts, this one is specific to a religious context and personal faith. That makes me think it might not be considered self-evident in the same way.\n\nC. \"Things equal to one and the same are equal to one another.\"\n\nThis is a familiar principle from geometry and mathematics. It's basically the transitive property of equality. If A equals C and B equals C, then A equals B. This seems like a fundamental, self-evident truth in logic and mathematics.\n\nD. \"Man is a rational being.\"\n\nThis proposition suggests that humans possess reason. It's a statement about human nature. While many philosophers, including Aquinas, have argued that rationality is a defining characteristic of humans, is this self-evident? It seems widely accepted, but perhaps not as immediately obvious as the other options.\n\nLet me think again. Option B stands out as being distinctly different in nature. It's a religious or spiritual statement, whereas the others are more general philosophical or logical principles. So, maybe that's the one that doesn't fit as a self-evident proposition.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if any of the others might not be self-evident.\n\nOption A: \"Every whole is greater than its part.\" This seems self-evident in a general sense, though maybe in some philosophical systems, there could be exceptions, like in cases involving infinity or in certain interpretations of parts and wholes. But generally, it's accepted as true.\n\nOption C: The transitive property of equality is foundational in logic and mathematics and is indeed treated as self-evident.\n\nOption D: \"Man is a rational being.\" While this is a common view, especially in Western philosophy, it might not be universally accepted across all cultures or philosophical schools. For example, some Eastern philosophies might emphasize other aspects of human nature. However, Aquinas did believe in human rationality, being influenced by Aristotelian philosophy.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option B is indeed the one that doesn't fit. It's not a general principle but a specific religious expression, and self-evident propositions are usually more universal in nature.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all of A, C, and D are self-evident in their respective domains, while B is not.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider whether these propositions are meant to be self-evident in a philosophical sense or in a theological one.\n\nAquinas was a theologian and philosopher, so his works blend both. Perhaps \"The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us\" is a self-evident truth for those who have faith, but for others, it might not be evident at all.\n\nBut generally speaking, self-evident propositions are meant to be recognizable as true by anyone with reason, regardless of their beliefs.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then B might not qualify as self-evident because it depends on specific religious beliefs.\n\nWhereas A, C, and D are more general statements about the nature of reality, equality, and human nature, which Aquinas would consider knowable through reason.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B. \"The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
