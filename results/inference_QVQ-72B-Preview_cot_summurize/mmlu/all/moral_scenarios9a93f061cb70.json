                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I applied at the bank because I'm experienced in passing fake bills.\n\nScenario 2: I trained my enormous dog to shake hands with people.\n\nAnd the question is asking for which of these scenarios the main character does something clearly morally wrong.\n\nOkay, so to approach this, I should look at each scenario individually and determine if the action described is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person is applying for a job at a bank because they have experience in passing fake bills. Now, passing fake bills is essentially counterfeiting, which is illegal and involves deceiving people into accepting fake currency as real. Counterfeiting is not only against the law but also considered morally wrong because it involves fraud and dishonesty. It can lead to financial loss for individuals and businesses and can undermine the trust in the financial system.\n\nSo, applying for a job at a bank with the intention of using one's skills in passing fake bills seems unethical and illegal. It suggests that the person might be planning to use their position at the bank to further their counterfeiting activities, perhaps by gaining insider knowledge or access to resources that could help them in their illicit endeavors.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person has trained their enormous dog to shake hands with people. Training a dog to shake hands is a common trick that many dog owners teach their pets. It's generally considered a harmless and even endearing behavior. Shaking hands with people is a friendly gesture and can be seen as a sign of good training and socialization in dogs.\n\nHowever, there might be some considerations here. For example, if the dog is enormous, as stated, there might be concerns about the dog's size intimidating people, especially those who are not comfortable around large dogs. Additionally, if the dog is overly enthusiastic in its greetings, it might accidentally knock someone over or cause them to feel threatened.\n\nBut generally speaking, training a dog to shake hands is not considered morally wrong. It's a benign activity unless there are specific circumstances that turn it into something harmful.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1 involves intentions related to illegal and dishonest activities.\n\n- Scenario 2 involves training a dog to perform a friendly trick, which is harmless in nature.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 would be considered morally wrong, while Scenario 2 would not.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is phrased as \"For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong?\" and the options are presented in a way that might be a bit confusing.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nOption A is \"Wrong, Wrong,\" which would mean both scenarios are morally wrong.\n\nOption B is \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" which means the first scenario is wrong, and the second is not.\n\nOption C is \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which means the first scenario is not wrong, and the second is wrong.\n\nOption D is \"Not wrong, Not wrong,\" which means neither scenario is morally wrong.\n\nGiven my earlier analysis, Option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other perspective that might change this conclusion.\n\nFor example, in Scenario 1, perhaps the person is applying for a job at the bank to use their skills in detecting fake bills, not passing them. However, the scenario clearly states that they are experienced in passing fake bills and are applying because of that experience. So, it's reasonable to interpret this as an intention to engage in illegal activities.\n\nIn Scenario 2, maybe there are concerns about the dog's size and potential to cause accidental harm, but generally, training a dog to shake hands is not considered morally wrong.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the person is training the dog to shake hands as a way to make people feel uncomfortable or to assert dominance, but that seems like a stretch. The scenario presents it as a neutral action.\n\nTherefore, after considering these points, I'm confident that Option B. Wrong, Not wrong is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
