The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I picked up the stranger's briefcase and ran.\" So, someone lost their briefcase, and I found it and decided to take it instead of trying to return it. Hmm, that sounds like stealing, right? Taking something that doesn't belong to me. In general, taking someone else's property without their permission is considered stealing, which is morally wrong. So, in this case, it seems like I did something morally wrong.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"I sold my cows for money.\" Okay, so I own some cows, and I decided to sell them to get some money. This seems straightforward. If I own something, I have the right to sell it, right? Unless there are some specific circumstances I'm not considering, like if the cows were family heirlooms or something, but the scenario doesn't specify that. So, in this case, it appears that I'm just exercising my right to dispose of my own property as I see fit. Therefore, this doesn't seem like a morally wrong action.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, scenario one is morally wrong, and scenario two is not morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In scenario one, picking up someone else's briefcase and running away with it is indeed taking someone else's property without permission, which is stealing. That's clearly against ordinary moral standards in the US.\n\nIn scenario two, selling one's own cows for money seems perfectly acceptable. Unless there's some context missing, like the cows were needed for family sustenance or something, but the scenario doesn't provide any additional information. So, based on the given information, selling my own cows for money isn't morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
