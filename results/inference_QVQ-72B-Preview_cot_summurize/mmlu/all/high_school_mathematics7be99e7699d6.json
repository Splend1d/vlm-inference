                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have this equation:\n\n\\[\\binom{23}{4} + \\binom{23}{5} = \\binom{24}{k}\\]\n\nAnd we need to find the sum of all integers \\(k\\) that make this equation true. The answer choices are 24, 5, 3, and 21, so I need to find which of these is correct.\n\nFirst, I recall that the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) represents the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) items from \\(n\\) items, without regard to order. There's a property of binomial coefficients that might be useful here. I think it's Pascal's identity, which says:\n\n\\[\\binom{n}{k} + \\binom{n}{k+1} = \\binom{n+1}{k+1}\\]\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Actually, I think it's:\n\n\\[\\binom{n}{k} + \\binom{n}{k-1} = \\binom{n+1}{k}\\]\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me look it up in my notes.\n\nOkay, according to my notes, Pascal's identity is:\n\n\\[\\binom{n}{k} + \\binom{n}{k+1} = \\binom{n+1}{k+1}\\]\n\nSo, in this problem, we have \\(\\binom{23}{4} + \\binom{23}{5} = \\binom{24}{5}\\), because according to Pascal's identity, \\(\\binom{23}{4} + \\binom{23}{5} = \\binom{24}{5}\\).\n\nBut the equation given is \\(\\binom{23}{4} + \\binom{23}{5} = \\binom{24}{k}\\), and according to what I just figured out, \\(k = 5\\) is one solution.\n\nBut is there another value of \\(k\\) that satisfies this equation? The problem asks for the sum of all integers \\(k\\) that make the equation true, so maybe there's more than one value of \\(k\\).\n\nI recall that binomial coefficients are symmetric, meaning \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}\\). So, \\(\\binom{24}{5} = \\binom{24}{24-5} = \\binom{24}{19}\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(k = 5\\) and \\(k = 19\\) are both solutions to the equation.\n\nSo, the sum of these \\(k\\) values is \\(5 + 19 = 24\\), which matches one of the answer choices.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure there aren't any other values of \\(k\\) that could satisfy the equation. Is there any other \\(k\\) such that \\(\\binom{24}{k} = \\binom{23}{4} + \\binom{23}{5}\\)?\n\nWell, we've already used the identity and the symmetry, so it seems like \\(k = 5\\) and \\(k = 19\\) are the only solutions.\n\nLet me consider if there could be a \\(k = 12\\), for example. Let's compute \\(\\binom{24}{12}\\) and see if it equals \\(\\binom{23}{4} + \\binom{23}{5}\\).\n\nFirst, compute \\(\\binom{23}{4}\\) and \\(\\binom{23}{5}\\):\n\n\\[\\binom{23}{4} = \\frac{23 \\times 22 \\times 21 \\times 20}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{23 \\times 11 \\times 7 \\times 20}{24} = \\frac{23 \\times 11 \\times 7 \\times 20}{24}\\]\n\nWait, that seems messy. Maybe I should use a calculator for this, but since this is a manual solution, let's see if there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n-1}{k} + \\binom{n-1}{k-1}\\), which is just Pascal's identity again.\n\nBut I think I've already used that.\n\nLet me consider the graph of \\(\\binom{24}{k}\\) as a function of \\(k\\). It's symmetric and has a single peak around \\(k = 12\\). Since \\(\\binom{24}{5} = \\binom{24}{19}\\), and these are less than \\(\\binom{24}{12}\\), it makes sense that no other \\(k\\) would satisfy the equation because the binomial coefficients increase up to \\(k = 12\\) and then decrease.\n\nTherefore, the only solutions are \\(k = 5\\) and \\(k = 19\\), and their sum is \\(5 + 19 = 24\\).\n\nSo, the answer should be 24.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 24\n\nB. 5\n\nC. 3\n\nD. 21\n\nThe correct choice is A. 24.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
