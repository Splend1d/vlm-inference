                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out how the federal court is likely to proceed. Let me try to understand all the parts involved.\n\nFirst, there's a woman who sued her former employer in state court for age and sex discrimination under both state and federal law. That means she has claims based on state laws and federal laws. Normally, these kinds of cases can be brought in state court, but since there are federal claims, there's the possibility of removing the case to federal court.\n\nBut in this situation, her attorney didn't remove the case because of the federal claims; instead, he removed it because he was embarrassed by the judge in state court and wants to avoid further difficulties. So, the removal seems to be motivated more by the attorney's personal experience with the judge rather than the nature of the claims themselves.\n\nNow, the employer's attorney has timely moved to remand, which means send the case back to state court. So, the question is, what is the federal court likely to do in response to this motion?\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. Remand the entire case.\n\nB. Remand the state claims but keep the federal claims.\n\nC. Retain the case to avoid the risk of bias and impropriety in having it proceed before a judge who has shown clear hostility toward the woman's attorney.\n\nD. Retain the case, because it was timely removed and the woman alleges federal claims.\n\nOkay, let's analyze each option.\n\nStarting with option A: remanding the entire case. This would mean sending everything back to state court. But since there are federal claims involved, and generally, federal courts have jurisdiction over cases involving federal questions, I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nOption B: remanding the state claims but keeping the federal claims. This seems like an exercise of supplemental jurisdiction, where the federal court keeps the federal claims and sends the state claims back. But in this case, the original claims were brought in state court, and removal was based on federal-question jurisdiction. So, maybe the federal court could keep the federal claims and send the state claims back, but I need to think about whether that's appropriate here.\n\nOption C: retaining the case to avoid bias and impropriety due to the judge's hostility towards the woman's attorney. This seems a bit tricky. While it's true that the woman's attorney had a bad experience with the judge, I'm not sure if that's enough to keep the case in federal court. Judges are supposed to be impartial, and just because one attorney had a difficult time doesn't necessarily mean there's institutional bias in the state court system.\n\nOption D: retaining the case because it was timely removed and federal claims are alleged. This seems straightforward. The case was properly removed based on federal-question jurisdiction, and as long as that jurisdiction exists, the federal court can keep the case.\n\nBut wait, the removal was based on federal-question jurisdiction, which is generally allowed when there are federal claims involved. However, there might be some considerations here regarding the propriety of the removal.\n\nI recall that removal to federal court is governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441, which allows removal based on federal question jurisdiction if the complaint states a claim arising under the laws of the United States. In this case, the woman has asserted claims under both state and federal law, so removal is permissible based on the federal claims.\n\nHowever, there might be some exceptions or considerations that could lead the federal court to remand the case back to state court.\n\nOne thing that comes to mind is the concept of forum non conveniens, where the federal court might decide that the state court is a more appropriate forum for the case, especially if the state law claims are more significant than the federal claims.\n\nAnother consideration could be whether the removal was done in bad faith. Here, the woman's attorney removed the case not because of the federal claims but because he had a bad experience with the state court judge. That might be seen as an improper motive for removal, which could be a factor in deciding whether to remand.\n\nI need to think about whether bad faith in removal can be a ground for remand. I did a quick search, and I found that in some cases, courts have considered the motives behind removal, especially if there's an attempt to forum shop or delay proceedings.\n\nIn this scenario, the woman's attorney is trying to avoid a particular judge in state court, which might be seen as forum shopping or an improper attempt to change the judge assigned to the case.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the federal court might view the removal as improper and remand the case back to state court.\n\nBut on the other hand, the case was properly removable based on federal-question jurisdiction, and the timeliness of the removal is not in question. So, purely from a jurisdictional standpoint, the federal court has the authority to hear the case.\n\nHowever, federal courts have discretion in certain circumstances, and they might choose to remand a case if they feel that the removal was done in bad faith or for improper purposes.\n\nLet me see if I can find any case law or statutory provisions that address this specific issue.\n\nI found that under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c), a case may be remanded to state court if it appears that the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction. But in this case, there is jurisdiction based on the federal claims.\n\nAdditionally, some courts have held that even if jurisdiction exists, they may remand a case if the removal was fraudulent or in bad faith.\n\nIn this scenario, the removal was based on the attorney's desire to avoid a particular judge, which might be considered an improper motive.\n\nSo, perhaps the federal court would consider this and remand the case back to state court.\n\nAlternatively, the federal court might decide to keep the case, arguing that once jurisdiction is established, the court has the power to hear the case, regardless of the motives behind the removal.\n\nThis is a bit of a grey area, and I think it depends on the specific facts and the discretion of the federal judge.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose the federal court decides to keep the case. What are the potential consequences?\n\nFirst, the case would proceed in federal court under federal procedural rules, which might differ from those in state court.\n\nSecond, if the state law claims are significant, there might be concerns about the federal court's ability to interpret state law correctly.\n\nOn the other hand, if the federal court remands the case, what are the implications?\n\nThe case would go back to state court, where it was originally filed, and proceed under state procedural rules.\n\nMoreover, the woman's attorney would have to deal with the judge who previously embarrassed him, which might be a source of concern.\n\nBut, again, judges are expected to be impartial, and a single embarrassing incident shouldn't necessarily prejudice the entire case.\n\nPerhaps the federal court would consider the attorney's experience with the judge and decide whether it constitutes a basis for recusal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455, which allows judges to disqualify themselves in certain circumstances.\n\nHowever, that's a separate issue from the remand decision.\n\nI need to focus on what the federal court is likely to do in response to the motion to remand.\n\nGiven that the removal was timely and based on federal-question jurisdiction, the federal court has the power to hear the case.\n\nBut, considering the attorney's motive for removal was to avoid a particular judge rather than because of the federal claims themselves, the federal court might view the removal as improper and remand the case back to state court.\n\nAlternatively, the federal court might decide that since jurisdiction exists, it should retain the case, especially if the federal claims are substantial.\n\nIn this case, the discrimination claims are based on both state and federal law, so it's a mixed bag.\n\nMaybe the federal court would choose to retain the federal claims and remand the state claims, exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims if it chooses to retain them.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me look at some case law to see how courts have handled similar situations.\n\nI found a case called Carnegie-Mellon University v. Cohill, 484 U.S. 343 (1988), which dealt with the retention of pendent state claims in federal court. The Supreme Court held that even when a federal court has jurisdiction over state law claims, it may decline to exercise that jurisdiction and remand the state claims if considerations of judicial economy, convenience, and fairness to the litigants favor remand.\n\nAnother case is Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Shimizu Corp., 516 F.2d 21 (6th Cir. 1975), where the court discussed the propriety of removal and the role of bad faith in removal.\n\nIn Thermtron, the court held that removal based on diversity jurisdiction was improper when the defendant was a citizen of the state where the action was brought, even if the plaintiff consented to removal. However, that's a different situation from the one here.\n\nWait, in this scenario, it's not a diversity jurisdiction case; it's a federal-question jurisdiction case based on the federal discrimination claims.\n\nSo, perhaps Thermtron isn't directly applicable.\n\nLet me see if there are any cases where removal was based on federal-question jurisdiction, and the court considered the motives behind the removal.\n\nI found a case called Badger v. Plaquemines Parish School Board, 635 F.2d 343 (5th Cir. 1981), where the court discussed the propriety of removal and the role of bad faith.\n\nIn Badger, the court held that removal based on federal-question jurisdiction was proper, and the court declined to remand the case despite the plaintiff's argument that the removal was improper.\n\nHowever, that was a different situation, and I'm not sure if it directly applies here.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose the federal court decides to remand the case back to state court. What standard would they use to make that decision?\n\nUnder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c), a case may be remanded if it appears that the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction. But in this case, there is jurisdiction based on the federal claims.\n\nAdditionally, some circuits have held that bad faith in removal can be a ground for remand, even if jurisdiction exists.\n\nFor example, in Carnegie v. Nashua Corp., 977 F.2d 671 (1st Cir. 1992), the court held that removal based on diversity jurisdiction was improper when the removing party had fraudulent motives.\n\nSimilarly, in Badger, the court mentioned that removal must be done in good faith.\n\nSo, perhaps the federal court in this scenario would consider the woman's attorney's motive for removal\u2014avoiding a particular judge\u2014to be bad faith, and therefore remand the case back to state court.\n\nOn the other hand, the attorney removed the case based on federal-question jurisdiction, which is permitted, and the removal was timely. So, maybe the federal court would decide that as long as jurisdiction exists and the removal was timely, they should retain the case.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to think about it differently.\n\nSuppose the federal court decides to keep the case. What are the potential downsides?\n\nFirst, the case was originally filed in state court, and the plaintiff might prefer to have it there, especially since state law claims are involved.\n\nSecond, if the removal was done to avoid a particular judge, and that judge is known for being tough on plaintiffs in discrimination cases, perhaps there's a concern about forum shopping.\n\nBut, again, federal courts have the power to hear cases based on federal-question jurisdiction, and they can manage state law claims through supplemental jurisdiction.\n\nAlternatively, the federal court might decide that since the federal claims are substantial and related to important civil rights issues, it's appropriate to retain the case.\n\nMoreover, having the case in federal court might offer certain advantages, such as a more uniform application of federal discrimination laws.\n\nBut, balancing that, if the state court is equally competent to handle federal claims, perhaps remanding the case back would be the better course of action.\n\nI need to consider the principle of comity, which respects the jurisdiction and procedures of state courts.\n\nFederal courts are generally reluctant to interfere with state court proceedings unless necessary, especially when state courts are competent to handle the federal claims.\n\nIn this case, since the state court was the original forum and the federal claims can be heard there, perhaps remanding the case back to state court would be the appropriate action.\n\nAdditionally, considering that the removal was motivated by the attorney's personal experience with the judge, rather than a substantive reason related to the claims themselves, the federal court might view this as an improper attempt to change forums.\n\nTherefore, the federal court might decide to remand the entire case back to state court.\n\nAlternatively, the federal court could retain the federal claims and remand the state claims, exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims if it chooses to do so.\n\nBut in this scenario, since the state claims are substantial and related to the federal claims, perhaps it's better to have all claims heard in one court.\n\nMoreover, if the federal court retains the case, it can manage both the federal and state claims efficiently.\n\nHowever, given the attorney's motive for removal, the federal court might decide that the case should remain in state court, where it was originally filed.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the most likely outcome is that the federal court will remand the entire case back to state court.\n\nSo, the answer is A. Remand the entire case.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
