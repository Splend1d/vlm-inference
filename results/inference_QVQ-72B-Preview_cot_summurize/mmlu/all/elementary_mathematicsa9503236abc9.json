                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: 48 over 88 equals ? over 11. It's asking me to find the number that makes this statement true. The options are 6, 11, 8, or 5. Hmm, I need to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the equation is saying. It's a proportion, right? So, 48/88 = ?/11. I think the symbol is like a fraction bar, meaning that the ratio of 48 to 88 is equal to the ratio of some number to 11.\n\nTo solve for the unknown number, I can cross-multiply. That's a standard way to handle proportions. So, 48 times 11 should be equal to 88 times the unknown number.\n\nLet me calculate 48 times 11. 48 times 10 is 480, and 48 times 1 is 48. So, 48 times 11 is 528.\n\nNow, I need to set that equal to 88 times the unknown number. So, 528 = 88 * ?\n\nTo find the unknown number, I can divide both sides by 88. 528 divided by 88.\n\nLet me do that division. 88 times 6 is 528. Yes, because 80 times 6 is 480, and 8 times 6 is 48, so total 528.\n\nSo, the unknown number is 6.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the beginning:\n\nWe have 48/88 = ?/11.\n\nCross-multiplying: 48 * 11 = 88 * ?\n\n48 * 11 = 528.\n\nSo, 88 * ? = 528.\n\nNow, dividing both sides by 88: ? = 528 / 88.\n\n528 divided by 88 is 6.\n\nAlternatively, I can simplify the original fraction 48/88.\n\nLet's see, both 48 and 88 can be divided by 16.\n\n48 \u00f7 16 = 3, and 88 \u00f7 16 = 5.5. Wait, that doesn't make sense because proportions are usually with whole numbers.\n\nMaybe I should try dividing both numerator and denominator by 8.\n\n48 \u00f7 8 = 6, and 88 \u00f7 8 = 11.\n\nSo, 48/88 simplifies to 6/11.\n\nTherefore, the unknown number is 6.\n\nAlright, that matches my earlier answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me check if 6/11 equals 48/88.\n\nTo check, I can cross-multiply: 6 * 88 = 528, and 48 * 11 = 528.\n\nYes, both sides are equal, so the answer is consistent.\n\nI don't think there's any other way this question could be interpreted. It's straightforward proportion solving.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 6} \\]"
