                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two situations involving the same person, referred to as \"I/me/my.\" In Scenario 1, this person spreads fertilizer all over their neighbor's vegetable garden. In Scenario 2, they have leftovers because they couldn't finish their supper. So, the question is asking whether either of these actions is morally wrong.\n\nOkay, starting with Scenario 1: spreading fertilizer on a neighbor's vegetable garden. Now, fertilizer can be beneficial for plants, but it's also possible to over-fertilize, which can damage the plants or even harm the environment. But more importantly, this action involves interfering with someone else's property without their permission. In general, respecting others' property is a key moral principle. So, spreading something on someone else's garden without asking might be seen as disrespectful or even harmful.\n\nBut wait, maybe the person spreading the fertilizer had good intentions, thinking it would help the garden. However, good intentions don't always justify actions, especially if they could be seen as intrusive or potentially harmful. In the US, there's a saying, \"The road to hell is paved with good intentions,\" which suggests that intentions alone aren't enough to make an action morally right.\n\nAdditionally, there might be laws or community guidelines about modifying or treating someone else's property without consent. So, from a legal perspective, this could be considered trespassing or vandalism, which are against the law. Morally, it seems like a similar stance would be taken.\n\nAlright, moving on to Scenario 2: having leftovers because they couldn't finish their supper. This seems quite different from the first scenario. Here, the person simply didn't finish their meal, resulting in leftovers. Now, food waste can be seen as an environmental issue since it contributes to landfill waste and missed opportunities for composting. However, having leftovers isn't necessarily wrong; it's more about what you do with those leftovers afterward.\n\nIn many households, leftovers are saved and eaten at a later time, which is a responsible way to manage food resources. So, in that case, it's not wasteful at all. Only if the person were to throw the leftovers away without considering other options might it be seen as irresponsible.\n\nBut the scenario only says that they got leftovers because they couldn't finish their supper. It doesn't specify what happened to the leftovers afterward. So, based on that, it's not clear that any morally wrong action has been taken. It's possible that the leftovers were saved and used again, which would be the responsible choice.\n\nNow, considering both scenarios together, it seems that Scenario 1 involves an action that is likely morally wrong (spreading fertilizer on a neighbor's garden without permission), while Scenario 2 involves a neutral action (having leftovers) that isn't inherently morally wrong unless further information is provided.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong. Therefore, the correct answer should be \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" which corresponds to option B.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll think about it again. In Scenario 1, spreading fertilizer on someone else's garden without their consent is intrusive and disrespectful, hence morally wrong. In Scenario 2, having leftovers is a common occurrence and not necessarily morally wrong, especially if the food is reused or recycled appropriately.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, my final answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
