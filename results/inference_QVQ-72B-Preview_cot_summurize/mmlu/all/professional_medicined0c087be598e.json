                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this case about a 45-year-old man who's experiencing right shoulder pain. It started after he was chopping wood two days ago. When the doctor examined his right upper extremity, there were no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness. But interestingly, the pain comes back when he externally rotates his shoulder against resistance, and there's no weakness noted. The question is asking which tendon is most likely inflamed in this scenario, besides the teres minor.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context here. The patient has shoulder pain that was induced by a physically demanding activity\u2014chopping wood\u2014which involves a lot of forceful movements of the shoulder, especially in external rotation and abduction. The fact that the pain is reproduced with external rotation against resistance suggests that specific muscles involved in that motion might be affected.\n\nLet's recall the muscles and tendons involved in shoulder external rotation. The main muscles that externally rotate the shoulder are the infraspinatus and the teres minor. The supraspinatus is more involved in abduction, the subscapularis in internal rotation, and the pectoralis major is a\u80f8\u524d muscle that adducts and internally rotates the arm.\n\nGiven that, the teres minor and infraspinatus are both external rotators of the shoulder. So, if the patient is experiencing pain during external rotation against resistance, it's likely that one or both of these muscles or their tendons are irritated or inflamed.\n\nThe question mentions that, in addition to the teres minor, which other tendon is most likely inflamed. So, assuming that the teres minor is already considered to be involved, the next likely candidate should be another external rotator.\n\nLet's eliminate the options that are less likely:\n\nB. Pectoralis: This is primarily an internal rotator and adductor of the arm, so it's not directly involved in external rotation.\n\nC. Subscapularis: This is an internal rotator of the shoulder, so again, not directly involved in external rotation.\n\nD. Supraspinatus: This muscle is primarily responsible for abducting the arm, not external rotation.\n\nThat leaves option A. Infraspinatus.\n\nGiven that both teres minor and infraspinatus are external rotators, and the patient is experiencing pain during external rotation against resistance, it makes sense that the infraspinatus could be inflamed as well.\n\nAdditionally, considering the mechanism of injury\u2014chopping wood, which involves repeated overhead movements and external rotation\u2014both teres minor and infraspinatus could be overstrained, leading to tendonitis or inflammation.\n\nSo, based on the symptoms and the anatomical functions of the involved muscles, the most likely additional tendon to be inflamed in this patient, besides the teres minor, is the infraspinatus.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA. Infraspinatus"
