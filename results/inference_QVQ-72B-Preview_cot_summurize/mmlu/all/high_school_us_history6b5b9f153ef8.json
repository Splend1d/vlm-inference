The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.\"\n\u2014John C.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about John C. Calhoun's \"South Carolina Exposition and Protest\" from 1828. The question is asking which political position's language of \"protest\" is similar to Calhoun's in this document. The options are:\n\nA. The response of supporters of Andrew Jackson to the \"corrupt bargain\" of 1824.\n\nB. The response of New England Federalists to the War of 1812.\n\nC. The response of the Jefferson administration to the actions of the \"Barbary pirates.\"\n\nD. The response of Daniel Shays to fiscal policies of the Massachusetts legislature in the 1780s.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Calhoun was protesting in this document. I know that Calhoun was a prominent figure in American politics, especially known for his strong views on states' rights and nullification. The \"South Carolina Exposition and Protest\" was written in response to the Tariff of 1828, which was highly protective of Northern manufacturing but harmful to the Southern economy, particularly South Carolina's.\n\nIn this document, Calhoun argues that the federal government has overstepped its bounds and that states have the right to nullify federal laws that they believe are unconstitutional. He emphasizes the sovereignty of states and the idea that they should have the final say in interpreting the Constitution regarding their own powers.\n\nSo, the language of \"protest\" here involves states standing up against federal overreach, asserting their rights, and possibly nullifying federal laws that infringe on those rights.\n\nNow, I need to look at each option and see which one aligns with this kind of protest.\n\nOption A: The response of supporters of Andrew Jackson to the \"corrupt bargain\" of 1824.\n\nIn the 1824 presidential election, no candidate won a majority of electoral votes, so the decision was thrown into the House of Representatives. Henry Clay, who was Speaker of the House, threw his support behind John Quincy Adams, who then became President. Jackson's supporters believed that this was a \"corrupt bargain\" because Clay was later appointed as Adams' Secretary of State.\n\nThis was indeed a protest against perceived corruption in the political process, but it was more about personal politics and the presidency rather than states asserting their rights against federal overreach. So, it doesn't seem to directly align with Calhoun's argument about states' rights and nullification.\n\nOption B: The response of New England Federalists to the War of 1812.\n\nDuring the War of 1812, New England, which was predominantly Federalist, was opposed to the war. They believed that it benefited the South and the West more than New England. In response to the war, New England Federalists organized the Hartford Convention in 1814 to discuss their grievances and propose amendments to the Constitution that would limit the federal government's power, particularly in declaring war.\n\nThis protest involved states coming together to oppose federal policies that they believed were harmful to their region and seeking to limit federal power. This seems similar to Calhoun's argument for states to resist federal overreach and assert their own rights.\n\nOption C: The response of the Jefferson administration to the actions of the \"Barbary pirates.\"\n\nThe Barbary pirates were North African pirates who attacked American ships in the Mediterranean Sea in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. President Jefferson responded with the Barbary Wars, particularly the First Barbary War from 1801 to 1805, to combat piracy and protect American commerce.\n\nThis was more about foreign policy and military action by the federal government, not a protest by states against federal overreach. So, it doesn't seem relevant to Calhoun's arguments.\n\nOption D: The response of Daniel Shays to fiscal policies of the Massachusetts legislature in the 1780s.\n\nShays' Rebellion was an armed uprising in Massachusetts in 1786 and 1787, led by Daniel Shays, a veteran of the American Revolution. It was a protest against high taxes and heavy debts that were crippling many farmers in the state. The rebellion was ultimately put down, but it highlighted the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation and contributed to the push for a stronger federal government under the Constitution.\n\nThis was a protest against state policies, not federal overreach. Although it involved states' actions, it doesn't directly relate to Calhoun's arguments about states resisting federal laws.\n\nComparing all the options, Option B seems to be the most similar to Calhoun's \"South Carolina Exposition and Protest.\" Both involve states protesting against federal actions that they believe are detrimental to their interests and seeking to limit federal power to protect their own sovereignty.\n\nSo, my answer would be B. The response of New England Federalists to the War of 1812.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
