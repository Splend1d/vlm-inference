                    "text": "So I have this problem here: there's a segment that's 10 units long, and I need to pick two points A and B randomly on this segment to divide it into three smaller segments. Then, I have to find the probability that these three smaller segments can form a triangle. The options are 0, 10%, 25%, and 50%.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for three lengths to form a triangle. I remember something called the triangle inequality theorem, which says that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. So, if I have three lengths a, b, and c, then a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a.\n\nSo, if I divide the 10-unit segment into three parts, say lengths x, y, and z, with x + y + z = 10, I need to ensure that x + y > z, x + z > y, and y + z > x.\n\nBut since x + y + z = 10, I can rewrite the inequalities:\n\nx + y > z \u2192 x + y > 10 - x - y \u2192 2(x + y) > 10 \u2192 x + y > 5.\n\nSimilarly, x + z > y \u2192 x + z > 10 - x - z \u2192 2(x + z) > 10 \u2192 x + z > 5.\n\nAnd y + z > x \u2192 y + z > 10 - x - z \u2192 2(y + z) > 10 \u2192 y + z > 5.\n\nSo, for the three parts to form a triangle, each pair of lengths must sum to more than the third length, which simplifies to x + y > 5, x + z > 5, and y + z > 5.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability that this happens when I choose points A and B randomly on the segment.\n\nFirst, I should think about the total number of possible positions for points A and B. Since they're chosen randomly on the 10-unit segment, and they're distinct points, I need to consider all possible pairs of distinct points on the segment.\n\nWait, the problem says \"points A and B are chosen randomly such that A and B divide the segment into three smaller segments.\" It doesn't specify that A and B are distinct, but I think they can be anywhere on the segment, possibly coinciding.\n\nBut if A and B coincide, then one of the smaller segments has zero length, which wouldn't satisfy the triangle inequality because one side would be zero. So, perhaps I need to consider that A and B can be the same point, but in calculating the probability, I can ignore that case since it's measure zero.\n\nSo, let's assume A and B are distinct points chosen uniformly at random on the 10-unit segment.\n\nNow, to model this, I can think of the segment as a line from 0 to 10. I need to place two points A and B somewhere on this line, dividing it into three parts.\n\nLet's denote the positions of A and B as a and b, where a < b, for simplicity.\n\nThen, the three segments would have lengths:\n\n- From 0 to a: length a\n\n- From a to b: length (b - a)\n\n- From b to 10: length (10 - b)\n\nSo, x = a, y = b - a, z = 10 - b.\n\nNow, applying the triangle inequalities:\n\nx + y > z \u2192 a + (b - a) > 10 - b \u2192 b > 10 - b \u2192 2b > 10 \u2192 b > 5.\n\nx + z > y \u2192 a + (10 - b) > b - a \u2192 a + 10 - b > b - a \u2192 2a + 10 > 2b \u2192 a + 5 > b.\n\ny + z > x \u2192 (b - a) + (10 - b) > a \u2192 10 - a > a \u2192 10 > 2a \u2192 a < 5.\n\nSo, combining these inequalities:\n\n1. b > 5\n\n2. b < a + 5\n\n3. a < 5\n\nSince a and b are points on the segment from 0 to 10, with a < b, the sample space is the area in the coordinate plane where 0 < a < b < 10.\n\nI need to find the region within this sample space where all three inequalities hold.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, plot the sample space:\n\n- a goes from 0 to 10\n\n- b goes from a to 10\n\nSo, it's a right triangle with base 10 and height 10, but with the condition a < b, so it's a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (10,10), and (0,10).\n\nBut since a < b, it's actually a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (10,10), and (0,10), but excluding the area where b < a.\n\nWait, no. If a < b, then it's the area above the line a = b from a = 0 to a = 10.\n\nActually, it's a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (10,10), and (0,10), but since a < b, it's the area above the line a = b.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think of b going from a to 10, with a from 0 to 10.\n\nNow, the conditions are:\n\n- b > 5\n\n- b < a + 5\n\n- a < 5\n\nSo, I need to find the area where these inequalities hold within the sample space.\n\nLet me sketch this.\n\nFirst, draw the line b = a. The sample space is above this line, from a = 0 to a = 10, and b from a to 10.\n\nNow, add the condition b > 5. That's the area where b is above the horizontal line b = 5.\n\nAlso, b < a + 5.\n\nAnd a < 5.\n\nSo, a goes from 0 to 5.\n\nFor each a in (0,5), b goes from a to a + 5, and also b > 5.\n\nSo, b is between a and a + 5, but also b > 5.\n\nSo, for a < 5, b needs to be between a and a + 5, but also greater than 5.\n\nWait, but a < 5, and b > 5.\n\nSo, for a < 5, and b > 5, and b < a + 5.\n\nBut since a < 5 and b > 5, and b < a + 5, we need to ensure that a + 5 > 5, which it is since a < 5.\n\nWait, a < 5, so a + 5 > 5, so b is between 5 and a + 5, with a < 5.\n\nSo, for a in (0,5), b is in (5, a + 5).\n\nBut since a < 5, a + 5 < 10, so b < a + 5 is automatically satisfied as long as b > 5 and a < 5.\n\nWait, no. If a < 5, then a + 5 < 10, so b can be up to a + 5, but also b > 5.\n\nSo, for a in (0,5), b is from max(5, a) to a + 5.\n\nBut since a < 5, max(5, a) = 5.\n\nSo, b is from 5 to a + 5, with a < 5.\n\nBut a < 5 and b < 10, since b <= 10 always.\n\nWait, but b can be up to a + 5, and a < 5, so b < a + 5 < 10.\n\nSo, b is from 5 to a + 5, with a < 5.\n\nNow, to find the area where this holds within the sample space.\n\nThe sample space is a from 0 to 10, b from a to 10.\n\nBut we have additional constraints: a < 5, b > 5, and b < a + 5.\n\nSo, the favorable region is a in (0,5), b in (5, a + 5).\n\nNow, to find the area of this region and divide it by the total area of the sample space.\n\nFirst, find the total area of the sample space.\n\na goes from 0 to 10, b from a to 10.\n\nThis is a triangle with base 10 and height 10, so area = (1/2)*base*height = (1/2)*10*10 = 50.\n\nNow, find the area of the favorable region.\n\na in (0,5), b in (5, a + 5).\n\nFor each a in (0,5), b goes from 5 to a + 5.\n\nSo, for each a, the height is (a + 5) - 5 = a.\n\nWait, no. (a + 5) - 5 = a.\n\nWait, no. (a + 5) - 5 = a.\n\nWait, no. a + 5 - 5 = a.\n\nWait, no. If b goes from 5 to a + 5, then the height is (a + 5) - 5 = a.\n\nSo, for each a in (0,5), the area is a * da.\n\nWait, no. It's a strip of width da and height a, so area a da.\n\nBut actually, for each a, b goes from 5 to a + 5, which is a height of a, so for each a, the area is a.\n\nThen, integrating over a from 0 to 5, the total favorable area is integral from 0 to 5 of a da.\n\nIntegral of a from 0 to 5 is (1/2)*a^2 evaluated from 0 to 5, which is (1/2)*(25 - 0) = 12.5.\n\nSo, the favorable area is 12.5.\n\nThe total sample space area is 50.\n\nTherefore, the probability is favorable area / total area = 12.5 / 50 = 0.25, which is 25%.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, 25% is one of them.\n\nBut I feel like I might be missing something.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nIs the sample space really a triangle with area 50?\n\na goes from 0 to 10, b from a to 10.\n\nYes, that's a triangle with base 10 and height 10, area 50.\n\nFavorable region: a in (0,5), b in (5, a + 5).\n\nFor each a in (0,5), b goes from 5 to a + 5, which is a height of a.\n\nSo, area is integral from 0 to 5 of a da = (1/2)*a^2 from 0 to 5 = 12.5.\n\nProbability is 12.5 / 50 = 0.25 or 25%.\n\nWait, but is there any overlap or any part of the favorable region that's outside the sample space?\n\nFor a in (0,5), b in (5, a + 5), and since a < 5, a + 5 < 10, so b < 10 is satisfied.\n\nSo, no, the favorable region is entirely within the sample space.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be 25%.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the three segments as x, y, z, with x + y + z = 10, and x + y > z, x + z > y, y + z > x.\n\nFrom earlier, this simplifies to x + y > 5, x + z > 5, and y + z > 5.\n\nAlternatively, since x + y + z = 10, each of x, y, z must be less than 5, because if any one is 5 or more, then the sum of the other two would be 10 - 5 = 5, which wouldn't satisfy the triangle inequality.\n\nWait, actually, if any one side is greater than or equal to 5, then the sum of the other two would be less than or equal to 5, which wouldn't satisfy the triangle inequality.\n\nSo, for the triangle inequality to hold, all three sides must be less than 5.\n\nBecause if any one side is 5 or more, then the sum of the other two is 10 minus that side, which would be 5 or less, which wouldn't satisfy the triangle inequality.\n\nTherefore, for the three segments to form a triangle, each must be less than 5.\n\nSo, x < 5, y < 5, z < 5, and x + y + z = 10.\n\nNow, in terms of points A and B on the segment, with a < b, we have x = a, y = b - a, z = 10 - b.\n\nSo, x < 5 \u21d2 a < 5.\n\ny < 5 \u21d2 b - a < 5 \u21d2 b < a + 5.\n\nz < 5 \u21d2 10 - b < 5 \u21d2 b > 5.\n\nSo, again, we have a < 5, b > 5, and b < a + 5.\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo, the favorable region is a < 5, b > 5, b < a + 5.\n\nAnd the sample space is a from 0 to 10, b from a to 10.\n\nSo, the favorable area is a from 0 to 5, b from 5 to a + 5.\n\nAs calculated earlier, this area is 12.5, and the total area is 50, so probability is 25%.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 25%.\n\nBut let me check if there's any mistake in this reasoning.\n\nWait, in the sample space, a goes from 0 to 10, b from a to 10.\n\nBut in the favorable region, a < 5 and b > 5.\n\nSo, for a in (0,5), b in (5, a + 5).\n\nBut a + 5 < 10, since a < 5.\n\nSo, b goes from 5 to a + 5, with a + 5 < 10.\n\nWait, but when a = 5, a + 5 = 10, which is the upper limit of b.\n\nSo, for a in (0,5), b in (5,10).\n\nBecause a + 5 can be up to 10.\n\nWait, if a = 5, then b goes from 5 to 10.\n\nIf a < 5, b goes from 5 to a + 5, but a + 5 < 10.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, if a = 5, b goes from 5 to 10.\n\nIf a < 5, b goes from 5 to a + 5, but a + 5 < 10.\n\nWait, but a + 5 can be up to 10.\n\nSo, for a in (0,5), b in (5, a + 5), with a + 5 <= 10.\n\nBut since a < 5, a + 5 < 10.\n\nWait, no. If a = 5, a + 5 = 10.\n\nSo, for a in [0,5], b in [5, a + 5].\n\nBut in terms of area, it's still a in (0,5), b in (5, a + 5).\n\nSo, for each a in (0,5), b goes from 5 to a + 5, which is a height of a.\n\nSo, area is integral from 0 to 5 of a da = 12.5.\n\nTotal area is 50.\n\nProbability is 12.5 / 50 = 0.25 or 25%.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of uniform distribution.\n\nLet me normalize the segment to unit length for simplicity.\n\nSuppose the segment is of length 1, and I need to scale it up by a factor of 10 later.\n\nSo, points A and B are chosen randomly on the unit segment, dividing it into three parts.\n\nThen, the conditions would be similar, but scaled down by 10.\n\nBut perhaps that complicates things more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of choosing two points uniformly at random on the segment and ensuring that no one piece is longer than half the segment.\n\nBut I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 25%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25\\%} \\]"
