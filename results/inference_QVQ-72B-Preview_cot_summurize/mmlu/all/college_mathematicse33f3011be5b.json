                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that f is a continuously differentiable real-valued function defined on the open interval (-1, 4). That means it's smooth and has a derivative everywhere in that interval. It also says that f(3) = 5 and that the derivative f'(x) is greater than or equal to -1 for all x in that interval. The question is, what's the greatest possible value of f(0), and there are options: 3, 4, 5, or 8.\n\nAlright, so I need to find the maximum possible value of f(0) given these constraints. Let's think about what the derivative being at least -1 means. The derivative represents the slope of the function at any point, so the slope is never less than -1. That means the function isn't decreasing too quickly.\n\nI recall that for a differentiable function, the derivative gives the instantaneous rate of change. So if f'(x) \u2265 -1, that means at any point, the function is either staying the same, increasing, or decreasing, but not decreasing too steeply.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. I have the interval (-1, 4), and I know f(3) = 5. I need to find f(0). I need to figure out the highest possible value f can take at x=0 given that f(3)=5 and the derivative is at least -1 everywhere in the interval.\n\nMaybe I can use the mean value theorem here. The mean value theorem says that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists some c in (a, b) such that f'(c) = [f(b) - f(a)] / (b - a).\n\nBut in this case, the interval is open, (-1, 4), but since it's continuously differentiable on (-1, 4), maybe I can still apply a similar idea.\n\nLet me consider the interval from 0 to 3, since I know f(0) and f(3). If I apply the mean value theorem on [0, 3], assuming it holds, then there exists a point c in (0, 3) such that f'(c) = [f(3) - f(0)] / (3 - 0) = [5 - f(0)] / 3.\n\nBut wait, the interval is open, and the function is defined on (-1, 4), but maybe I can consider [0, 3] as a subinterval.\n\nGiven that f'(x) \u2265 -1 for all x in (-1, 4), then in particular for x in (0, 3), f'(x) \u2265 -1.\n\nSo, [5 - f(0)] / 3 \u2265 -1.\n\nLet me solve that inequality:\n\n[5 - f(0)] / 3 \u2265 -1\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n5 - f(0) \u2265 -3\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n\n- f(0) \u2265 -8\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (remember to flip the inequality):\n\nf(0) \u2264 8\n\nSo, f(0) is less than or equal to 8.\n\nThat suggests that the greatest possible value of f(0) is 8.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if this is the best possible bound. Maybe I can find a function that satisfies f(3)=5, f'(x)\u2265-1 for all x in (-1,4), and f(0)=8.\n\nLet me try to construct such a function.\n\nSuppose f(x) is a straight line with constant slope. Let's set f'(x) = -1. Then f(x) = -x + c. Since f(3) = 5, plugging in x=3: -3 + c = 5 \u21d2 c=8. So f(x) = -x + 8.\n\nThen f(0) = -0 + 8 = 8.\n\nBut wait, if f'(x) = -1, that's equal to the lower bound of the derivative, and it achieves f(0)=8.\n\nIs there a function where f'(x) > -1 somewhere that could make f(0) larger than 8?\n\nWell, if f'(x) is greater than -1 somewhere, that would mean the function isn't decreasing as steeply as -x + 8, so f(0) would be less than or equal to 8.\n\nWait, no. If f'(x) > -1 somewhere, that means the function is decreasing less steeply than -x + 8, which would mean that f(0) could be higher than 8.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again.\n\nIf f'(x) > -1 somewhere, it means the function is decreasing less steeply than -x + 8. So, from x=0 to x=3, if the function decreases less steeply, then at x=3, f(3) would be higher than if it were decreasing at the rate of -1.\n\nBut we know f(3)=5, which matches the straight line f(x)=-x+8 where f(3)=5.\n\nIf f'(x) > -1 somewhere, say from x=0 to x=a, f'(x) > -1, and from x=a to x=3, f'(x) = -1, then the function would be higher than -x+8 at x=0.\n\nWait, let's consider that.\n\nSuppose from x=0 to x=a, f'(x) = -k, where -k > -1, so k < 1.\n\nThen f(x) in [0,a] would be f(x) = -kx + c.\n\nAt x=0, f(0) = c.\n\nAt x=a, f(a) = -k*a + c.\n\nThen from x=a to x=3, f'(x) = -1, so f(x) = -x + d.\n\nAt x=a, f(a) = -a + d.\n\nSo, -k*a + c = -a + d.\n\nAnd we know f(3) = -3 + d = 5 \u21d2 d = 8.\n\nAlso, f(0) = c.\n\nSo, from f(x) = -kx + c on [0,a], and f(x) = -x + 8 on [a,3].\n\nAt x=0, f(0) = c.\n\nAt x=a, -k*a + c = -a + 8.\n\nSo, c = -a + 8 + k*a.\n\nTherefore, f(0) = -a + 8 + k*a.\n\nSince k > -1 and less than 1 (because f'(x) \u2265 -1), let's see.\n\nWait, actually, k < 1 because -k > -1 \u21d2 k < 1.\n\nSo, f(0) = -a + 8 + k*a < -a + 8 + a = 8.\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, since k < 1, but k could be positive or negative.\n\nWait, k is the slope in [0,a], and it's -k, with -k > -1 \u21d2 k < 1.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that f'(x) \u2265 -1 for all x in (-1,4).\n\nI need to maximize f(0), given that f(3)=5.\n\nMaybe I can use the fact that the derivative is bounded below by -1.\n\nConsider the function f(x) = -x + 8, which has f'(x) = -1, and f(3)=5, f(0)=8.\n\nIs there a function with f'(x) > -1 somewhere that can have f(0) > 8?\n\nSuppose there is a function where f'(x) > -1 in some interval, say [0,a), and f'(x) = -1 on [a,3].\n\nThen, the function would be higher than -x + 8 at x=0.\n\nWait, no.\n\nIf f'(x) > -1 on [0,a), then the function is decreasing less steeply than -x + 8, so at x=a, f(a) > -a + 8.\n\nThen, from x=a to x=3, f'(x) = -1, so f(x) = -x + d, and f(3) = -3 + d = 5 \u21d2 d=8.\n\nSo, f(x) = -x + 8 on [a,3].\n\nAt x=a, f(a) = -a + 8.\n\nBut earlier, we had f(a) > -a + 8 from the first part.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, if f'(x) > -1 on [0,a), then f(a) > -a + 8.\n\nBut then, from x=a to x=3, f(x) = -x + 8, so f(a) = -a + 8.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nMaybe I should use the fundamental theorem of calculus.\n\nf(3) - f(0) = \u222b from 0 to 3 of f'(x) dx.\n\nGiven that f'(x) \u2265 -1, then \u222b from 0 to 3 of f'(x) dx \u2265 \u222b from 0 to 3 of -1 dx \u21d2 5 - f(0) \u2265 -3 \u21d2 5 - f(0) \u2265 -3 \u21d2 -f(0) \u2265 -8 \u21d2 f(0) \u2264 8.\n\nSo, again, f(0) \u2264 8.\n\nNow, can f(0) actually be 8?\n\nConsider the function f(x) = -x + 8.\n\nThen f(0) = 8, f(3) = -3 + 8 = 5, and f'(x) = -1, which satisfies f'(x) \u2265 -1.\n\nSo, f(0) can be 8.\n\nNow, is it possible for f(0) to be greater than 8?\n\nSuppose f(0) = 9.\n\nThen, f(3) - f(0) = 5 - 9 = -4.\n\nSo, \u222b from 0 to 3 of f'(x) dx = -4.\n\nBut f'(x) \u2265 -1, so \u222b from 0 to 3 of f'(x) dx \u2265 \u222b from 0 to 3 of -1 dx = -3.\n\nBut -4 < -3, which violates the inequality.\n\nTherefore, f(0) cannot be greater than 8.\n\nHence, the greatest possible value of f(0) is 8.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 3\n\nB. 4\n\nC. 5\n\nD. 8\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
