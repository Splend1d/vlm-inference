                    "text": " Okay, so I'm trying to understand this question about Lukianoff and Haidt's argument regarding the disinvitation of certain speakers on college campuses. The options are:\n\nA. It's an example of mental filtering.\n\nB. It will only serve to promote intellectual homogeneity on college and universities.\n\nC. It will encourage students to disregard positive aspects of a person's history.\n\nD. All of the above.\n\nI need to figure out which of these points Lukianoff and Haidt would agree with. I remember reading their work, especially \"The Coddling of the American Mind,\" where they discuss issues related to free speech and safety culture on college campuses.\n\nFirst, let's break down each option:\n\nA. Mental filtering: I think this refers to cognitive biases where people filter out information that doesn't align with their pre-existing beliefs. So, if disinviting speakers means that students are only exposed to ideas they already agree with, that sounds like mental filtering.\n\nB. Promote intellectual homogeneity: This seems related to the idea that if you only have speakers who hold similar views, the range of ideas on campus becomes narrower. Diversity of thought is reduced, leading to a more homogeneous intellectual environment.\n\nC. Encourage students to disregard positive aspects of a person's history: This might refer to situations where a speaker has made some controversial statements, but overall has a positive impact in their field. If they're disinvited based on those few statements, students might overlook their broader contributions.\n\nNow, thinking back to Lukianoff and Haidt's arguments, they emphasize the importance of free speech and the value of being exposed to a variety of ideas, even those that might be uncomfortable or offensive. They warn against overprotection, which can hinder intellectual growth and debate.\n\nGiven that, I would say that they would agree with all three points:\n\nA. Disinviting speakers is a form of mental filtering because it shields students from differing perspectives, reinforcing their existing beliefs.\n\nB. It promotes intellectual homogeneity by limiting the spectrum of ideas presented on campus, which they would likely view as negative.\n\nC. It encourages disregarding the positive aspects of a speaker's history, which aligns with their criticism of \"cancel culture\" where individuals are judged solely based on their worst actions or statements.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. All of the above.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. Is there any chance that they might disagree with one of these points?\n\nFor example, might they think that disinviting speakers serves a purpose beyond just filtering or promoting homogeneity? Perhaps in cases where a speaker is known for hate speech or inciting violence, disinvitation might be seen as necessary. However, Lukianoff and Haidt generally argue that even in such cases, it's better to confront and debate the ideas rather than suppress them.\n\nAdditionally, they might argue that disinviting speakers based on a single controversial statement could lead students to overlook the speaker's otherwise positive contributions, which aligns with option C.\n\nSo, overall, I think D is the correct answer. They would likely agree that disinviting speakers contributes to mental filtering, promotes intellectual homogeneity, and encourages disregarding positive aspects of a person's history.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
