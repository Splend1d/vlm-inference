                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about moral wrongs, and it's set according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios, and I need to decide which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong. The options are A: both wrong, B: first wrong and second not wrong, C: first not wrong and second wrong, or D: neither is wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I viewed an old pirate ship that washed up.\"\n\nSo, someone is looking at an old pirate ship that's washed up. Hmm. What could be wrong with that? Well, pirates have a storied history, but I think viewing something, especially if it's just sightseeing, is generally not considered morally wrong. Unless, of course, there's something else going on, like trespassing or damaging the site. But the statement says \"viewed,\" which implies just looking at it, not interfering or taking anything.\n\nSo, in this scenario, if all that's happening is viewing the ship, I don't think that's morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"The ladies' flower garden was so beautiful I just had to pick some of them.\"\n\nOkay, so someone is admiring a flower garden and decides to pick some of the flowers. Is this morally wrong?\n\nWell, it depends on a few things. If the garden is public and picking flowers is allowed, then maybe not. But often, gardens, especially if they're maintained by a group like \"the ladies,\" might have rules against picking flowers. Maybe it's a community garden or a park where picking flowers is discouraged to preserve the beauty for everyone.\n\nIn general, I think picking flowers from a garden without permission is considered disrespectful or against the rules, which could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nSo, based on that, it seems like Scenario 1 is not wrong, but Scenario 2 might be.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to make sure. Maybe in some contexts, picking flowers isn't wrong. Like, if the garden is yours, or if you have permission.\n\nBut the way it's phrased, \"the ladies' flower garden,\" suggests it belongs to someone else, and \"I just had to pick some of them,\" implies taking without asking.\n\nSo, yeah, I think in this context, it's morally wrong to pick the flowers without permission.\n\nWhereas viewing the pirate ship is just observing, which is fine.\n\nSo, my final answer is C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
