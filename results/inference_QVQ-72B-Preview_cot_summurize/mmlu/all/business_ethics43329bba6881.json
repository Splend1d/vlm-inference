                    "text": "So I've got this question here about ethical decision making. It says that factors affecting it can be broadly broken down into two types: one related to the unique characteristics of a person, and the other related to features of the person's environment or the particular issue. And the options are A. Tailored, Individual; B. Situational, Individual; C. Situational, Tailored; D. Individual, Situational.\n\nHmm, first off, I need to understand what each term means in this context. Let's start with \"individual\" factors. I think individual factors are about the person's own traits, like their personality, values, beliefs, or maybe their moral reasoning capacity. So, things that are specific to who they are as a person.\n\nNow, \"situational\" factors probably refer to the environment or the specific context in which the decision is being made. That could include things like social pressure, the urgency of the situation, the potential consequences of the decision, or the norms and expectations of the society or organization they're in.\n\n\"Tailored\" seems a bit different. When I hear \"tailored,\" I think of something that's customized or fitted specifically to an individual or a situation. So, maybe it's about personalized approaches or considerations.\n\nGiven that, I need to match these terms with the two types of factors mentioned: one related to the person's unique characteristics and the other related to the environment or the issue.\n\nLet me see. The first type is related to unique characteristics of the person. That sounds a lot like individual factors, because individual factors are specific to the person, like their personality or values.\n\nThen, the second type is related to features of the person's environment or the particular issue. That seems more aligned with situational factors, since it's about the situation or context surrounding the decision.\n\nSo, putting them together, it would be Individual and Situational factors.\n\nWait a minute, but option D says D. Individual, Situational, which matches what I just thought. But let's double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is Tailored, Individual. That doesn't seem right because Tailored seems more related to customization, which might be a part of individual factors, but it's not a direct match for the categories mentioned in the question.\n\nOption B is Situational, Individual. This is the reverse of what I thought. But the question specifies that the first type is related to unique characteristics of the person, which is more individual, and the second to environment or issue, which is more situational.\n\nOption C is Situational, Tailored. Again, Situational fits the environment or issue, but Tailored seems out of place here unless it's specifically referring to customized responses based on the situation, which might overlap with situational factors but isn't directly matching the categories provided.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option D. Individual, Situational seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that \"tailored\" could fit into one of these categories.\n\nTailored factors might involve customizing decisions based on individual characteristics or specific situational demands. However, in the context of ethical decision making, it's more about how individual and situational factors influence decisions, rather than the customization aspect.\n\nTherefore, I think the most straightforward and accurate answer is D. Individual, Situational.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
