                    "text": "So I have this question: \"What is the supplement of a 40\u00b0 angle?\" and the options are A. 50\u00b0, B. 130\u00b0, C. 140\u00b0, D. 220\u00b0. Hmm, I need to figure this out. I remember that supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees, but I should make sure I understand what \"supplement\" means in this context.\n\nFirst, let's recall what supplementary angles are. If two angles add up to 180 degrees, they are called supplementary angles. So, if one angle is 40 degrees, its supplement should be 180 degrees minus 40 degrees. Let me calculate that: 180 - 40 = 140 degrees. So, the supplement of a 40-degree angle should be 140 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, C. 140\u00b0 matches my calculation. But just to be thorough, I'll check the other options to make sure there isn't any trick here.\n\nOption A is 50\u00b0. Does 40\u00b0 + 50\u00b0 equal 180\u00b0? Let's see: 40 + 50 = 90, which is not 180. So, that can't be right.\n\nOption B is 130\u00b0. So, 40\u00b0 + 130\u00b0 equals 170\u00b0, which is also not 180\u00b0. So, that's not correct either.\n\nOption D is 220\u00b0. Adding 40\u00b0 and 220\u00b0 gives 260\u00b0, which is more than 180\u00b0. So, that doesn't fit the definition of supplementary angles.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 140\u00b0.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any other way to interpret the question. Is there a possibility of multiple supplements for an angle? No, because the supplement is unique for each angle measure between 0 and 180 degrees.\n\nAlso, I should remember that supplementary angles are angles that add up to 180 degrees, and they can be adjacent or not. But in this case, the question is just asking for the supplement of a single angle, so I don't think adjacency matters here.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the angle is acute, right, or obtuse. A 40\u00b0 angle is acute, and its supplement, 140\u00b0, is obtuse. That makes sense because supplements are complementary in a way that one is acute and the other is obtuse.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll see if there's any other concept that might relate to the supplement of an angle. For example, in geometry, the supplement of an angle can be found by subtracting the angle from 180 degrees, which is exactly what I did.\n\nLet me think about real-world examples. Imagine a straight line; it's 180 degrees. If one angle is 40 degrees, the other angle that makes the straight line would be 140 degrees. That visual helps confirm my answer.\n\nI should also consider if the question is trying to trick me by mentioning something about the supplement in a different context, like with parallel lines or something, but no, it's straightforward.\n\nSo, after all this thinking, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. 140\u00b0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ 140^\\circ} \\]"
