P, B. 3P, C. P/3, D. None of the above.\"\n\nAlright, I need to understand the relationship between a star-connected and a delta-connected system in terms of power. I remember that in electrical engineering, star and delta connections refer to how the windings of transformers or the phases of an AC system are connected.\n\nLet me recall the basics. In a star (or Y) connection, the neutral points of the windings are connected together, and in a delta connection, the windings are connected in a loop, forming a triangle.\n\nNow, there are standard transformation formulas to convert between star and delta connections. Specifically, there are relationships between the resistances or impedances in these connections.\n\nI think the question is referring to the power in a balanced three-phase system. In a balanced system, the line voltages and currents are equal in magnitude and 120 degrees apart in phase.\n\nLet me consider the power in a three-phase system. For a balanced three-phase system, the total power P is given by:\n\nP = \u221a3 * V_line * I_line * cos(\u03c6)\n\nWhere:\n\n- \u221a3 is a constant for three-phase systems.\n\n- V_line is the line voltage.\n\n- I_line is the line current.\n\n- cos(\u03c6) is the power factor.\n\nNow, in a star-connected system, the relationship between line voltage and phase voltage is:\n\nV_line = \u221a3 * V_phase\n\nAnd the line current is equal to the phase current:\n\nI_line = I_phase\n\nSo, the power in a star-connected system would be:\n\nP_star = \u221a3 * (\u221a3 * V_phase) * I_phase * cos(\u03c6) = 3 * V_phase * I_phase * cos(\u03c6)\n\nIn a delta-connected system, the relationship between line voltage and phase voltage is:\n\nV_line = V_phase\n\nAnd the line current is:\n\nI_line = \u221a3 * I_phase\n\nSo, the power in a delta-connected system would be:\n\nP_delta = \u221a3 * V_line * (\u221a3 * I_phase) * cos(\u03c6) = 3 * V_line * I_phase * cos(\u03c6)\n\nWait a minute, that seems off. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, in a delta connection, the phase voltage is equal to the line voltage, V_phase = V_line, and the phase current is equal to the line current divided by \u221a3, I_phase = I_line / \u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the power in a delta-connected system should be:\n\nP_delta = 3 * V_phase * I_phase * cos(\u03c6) = 3 * V_line * (I_line / \u221a3) * cos(\u03c6) = \u221a3 * V_line * I_line * cos(\u03c6)\n\nComparing this to the star-connected system:\n\nP_star = 3 * V_phase * I_phase * cos(\u03c6) = 3 * (V_line / \u221a3) * (I_line / 1) * cos(\u03c6) = \u221a3 * V_line * I_line * cos(\u03c6)\n\nWait, so both P_star and P_delta seem to be equal to \u221a3 * V_line * I_line * cos(\u03c6). Does that mean that the power in the delta-connected system is the same as in the star-connected system?\n\nBut the question is saying that if P is the power of the star-connected system, what is the power of the equivalent delta-connected system. According to my calculations, it should be the same, which is option A. P.\n\nBut I've heard somewhere that there might be a factor of 3 difference between star and delta connections in terms of power. Let me think again.\n\nMaybe I'm confusing something here. Let's consider the impedance in the star and delta connections.\n\nIn a star-delta transformation, the relationship between star and delta impedances is:\n\nZ_delta = 3 * Z_star\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me recall the exact transformation formulas.\n\nFor resistive circuits, the transformation formulas are:\n\nIn converting from star to delta:\n\nR_delta = R_star * (R_a + R_b + R_c) / R_opposite\n\nActually, for a balanced system with identical impedances in star, the equivalent delta impedances are:\n\nZ_delta = 3 * Z_star\n\nYes, that seems familiar.\n\nSo, if Z_delta = 3 * Z_star, then in terms of power, if we have the same voltage, the power in the delta connection would be lower because of the higher impedance.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that P_delta = \u221a3 * V_line * I_line * cos(\u03c6), which is the same as P_star.\n\nBut if Z_delta = 3 * Z_star, then for the same phase voltage and current, the power in delta would be higher by a factor of 3, but that contradicts what I initially thought.\n\nI must be missing something here.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Suppose I have a star-connected system with phase impedance Z_star, and a delta-connected system with phase impedance Z_delta.\n\nGiven that Z_delta = 3 * Z_star, as per the star-delta transformation.\n\nNow, in the star-connected system, the phase current is I_phase_star = V_phase / Z_star\n\nThe line current is I_line_star = I_phase_star\n\nThe power in the star-connected system is:\n\nP_star = 3 * V_phase * I_phase_star * cos(\u03c6) = 3 * V_phase * (V_phase / Z_star) * cos(\u03c6) = 3 * (V_phase)^2 / Z_star * cos(\u03c6)\n\nIn the delta-connected system, the phase voltage is V_phase_delta = V_line\n\nThe phase current is I_phase_delta = V_phase_delta / Z_delta = V_line / (3 * Z_star)\n\nBut in delta connection, the line current is I_line_delta = \u221a3 * I_phase_delta = \u221a3 * (V_line / (3 * Z_star)) = V_line / (\u221a3 * Z_star)\n\nWait, no. In delta connection, I_phase_delta = V_line / Z_delta = V_line / (3 * Z_star)\n\nAnd I_line_delta = \u221a3 * I_phase_delta = \u221a3 * (V_line / (3 * Z_star)) = V_line / (\u221a3 * Z_star)\n\nBut actually, in delta connection, the line current is \u221a3 times the phase current.\n\nSo, I_line_delta = \u221a3 * (V_line / (3 * Z_star)) = \u221a3 * V_line / (3 * Z_star) = V_line / (\u221a3 * Z_star)\n\nNow, the power in the delta-connected system is:\n\nP_delta = \u221a3 * V_line * I_line_delta * cos(\u03c6) = \u221a3 * V_line * (V_line / (\u221a3 * Z_star)) * cos(\u03c6) = \u221a3 * V_line * V_line / (\u221a3 * Z_star) * cos(\u03c6) = V_line^2 / Z_star * cos(\u03c6)\n\nBut in the star-connected system, V_phase = V_line / \u221a3\n\nSo, P_star = 3 * (V_line / \u221a3) * (V_line / \u221a3) / Z_star * cos(\u03c6) = 3 * (V_line^2 / 3) / Z_star * cos(\u03c6) = V_line^2 / Z_star * cos(\u03c6)\n\nTherefore, P_delta = P_star\n\nSo, the power in the delta-connected system is equal to the power in the star-connected system.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. P.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that maybe there's a factor of 3 difference, but according to this calculation, they are equal.\n\nPerhaps in some contexts, there might be a difference, but based on standard three-phase power calculations, the power should be the same in both connections when properly transformed.\n\nLet me check another way. Suppose I have a star-connected system with phase impedance Z, and I want to find the equivalent delta-connected system.\n\nIn the star connection, the phase voltage is V_phase = V_line / \u221a3\n\nThe phase current is I_phase = V_phase / Z = (V_line / \u221a3) / Z\n\nThe power per phase is P_phase = V_phase * I_phase * cos(\u03c6) = (V_line / \u221a3) * (V_line / (\u221a3 * Z)) * cos(\u03c6) = (V_line^2 / 3Z) * cos(\u03c6)\n\nTotal power is 3 times per phase, so P_star = 3 * (V_line^2 / 3Z) * cos(\u03c6) = V_line^2 / Z * cos(\u03c6)\n\nIn the delta connection, the phase impedance is Z_delta = 3Z\n\nThe phase voltage is V_phase_delta = V_line\n\nThe phase current is I_phase_delta = V_line / (3Z)\n\nThe power per phase is P_phase_delta = V_line * (V_line / (3Z)) * cos(\u03c6) = V_line^2 / (3Z) * cos(\u03c6)\n\nTotal power is 3 times per phase, so P_delta = 3 * (V_line^2 / (3Z)) * cos(\u03c6) = V_line^2 / Z * cos(\u03c6)\n\nAgain, P_delta = P_star\n\nTherefore, the power in the delta-connected system is equal to the power in the star-connected system.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. P.\n\nBut to make sure, maybe I should consider an example with actual values.\n\nSuppose V_line = 400V, Z_star = 4 ohms, and power factor cos(\u03c6) = 1 for simplicity.\n\nThen, P_star = \u221a3 * 400 * (400 / \u221a3) / 4 * 1 = \u221a3 * 400 * (400 / \u221a3) / 4 = \u221a3 * \u221a3 * 400 * 400 / 4 = 3 * 160000 / 4 = 3 * 40000 = 120000 W\n\nNow, for delta connection, Z_delta = 3 * Z_star = 12 ohms\n\nP_delta = \u221a3 * 400 * (400 / 12) * 1 = \u221a3 * 400 * (100 / 3) = \u221a3 * 400 * 100 / 3 = (400 * 100 * \u221a3) / 3\n\nBut \u221a3 * 400 = 400 * 1.732 \u2248 692.8, then 692.8 * 100 / 3 \u2248 23093.33 W\n\nWait, that doesn't match the star power of 120000 W. Hmm, seems like I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use line current for delta.\n\nLet me recalculate.\n\nIn star connection:\n\nV_phase = 400 / \u221a3 \u2248 230.94 V\n\nI_phase = 230.94 / 4 = 57.74 A\n\nP_star = 3 * 230.94 * 57.74 * 1 \u2248 3 * 13200 \u2248 39600 W\n\nWait, that's different from what I calculated earlier. Maybe I confused line and phase values.\n\nActually, in star connection, total power is P_star = \u221a3 * V_line * I_line * cos(\u03c6) = \u221a3 * 400 * (230.94 / 4) * 1 = \u221a3 * 400 * 57.74 \u2248 1.732 * 400 * 57.74 \u2248 1.732 * 23096 \u2248 40000 W\n\nWait, still not matching. Maybe I need to be more careful.\n\nActually, P_star = \u221a3 * V_line * I_line * cos(\u03c6) = \u221a3 * 400 * (400 / \u221a3) / 4 * 1 = \u221a3 * 400 * (400 / \u221a3) / 4 = \u221a3 * \u221a3 * 400 * 400 / 4 = 3 * 160000 / 4 = 3 * 40000 = 120000 W\n\nIn delta connection:\n\nZ_delta = 3 * Z_star = 12 ohms\n\nV_phase_delta = V_line = 400 V\n\nI_phase_delta = V_phase_delta / Z_delta = 400 / 12 \u2248 33.33 A\n\nI_line_delta = \u221a3 * I_phase_delta \u2248 1.732 * 33.33 \u2248 57.74 A\n\nP_delta = \u221a3 * V_line * I_line_delta * cos(\u03c6) = \u221a3 * 400 * 57.74 * 1 \u2248 1.732 * 400 * 57.74 \u2248 1.732 * 23096 \u2248 40000 W\n\nWait, that's not matching the star power of 120000 W. There must be a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that in delta connection, the line current is indeed \u221a3 times the phase current, but the phase voltage is equal to the line voltage.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nIn star connection:\n\nP_star = 3 * (V_phase)^2 / Z_star * cos(\u03c6) = 3 * (400 / \u221a3)^2 / 4 * 1 = 3 * (230.94)^2 / 4 = 3 * 53291.8 / 4 \u2248 3 * 13322.95 = 39968.85 W\n\nWait, still not matching the earlier calculation. Maybe I need to stick with the formula P = \u221a3 * V_line * I_line * cos(\u03c6).\n\nIn star connection:\n\nI_line_star = V_line / (Z_star * \u221a3) = 400 / (4 * \u221a3) \u2248 400 / 6.928 \u2248 57.74 A\n\nP_star = \u221a3 * V_line * I_line_star * cos(\u03c6) = 1.732 * 400 * 57.74 * 1 \u2248 1.732 * 23096 \u2248 40000 W\n\nWait, but earlier I thought P_star was 120000 W, but now it's 40000 W. Which one is correct?\n\nI think I'm getting confused. Let me look up the correct formula for three-phase power.\n\nThe formula for three-phase power is indeed P = \u221a3 * V_line * I_line * cos(\u03c6)\n\nIn star connection, I_line = I_phase, and V_phase = V_line / \u221a3\n\nSo, P_star = 3 * V_phase * I_phase * cos(\u03c6) = 3 * (V_line / \u221a3) * (V_line / (\u221a3 * Z_star)) * cos(\u03c6) = 3 * (V_line^2 / (3 * Z_star)) * cos(\u03c6) = V_line^2 / Z_star * cos(\u03c6)\n\nIn delta connection, V_phase = V_line, and I_phase = V_line / (3 * Z_star), since Z_delta = 3 * Z_star\n\nSo, P_delta = 3 * V_phase * I_phase * cos(\u03c6) = 3 * V_line * (V_line / (3 * Z_star)) * cos(\u03c6) = V_line^2 / Z_star * cos(\u03c6)\n\nTherefore, P_delta = P_star\n\nSo, the power in the delta-connected system is equal to the power in the star-connected system.\n\nHence, the answer should be A. P.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another perspective. Suppose we have a star-connected load with phase impedances Z_star, and a delta-connected load with phase impedances Z_delta = 3 * Z_star.\n\nIf we apply the same line voltage V_line to both systems, the total power consumed should be the same in both configurations.\n\nThis is because the star and delta connections are equivalent in terms of power consumption when the impedances are transformed by a factor of 3.\n\nTherefore, the power in the delta-connected system should be equal to the power in the star-connected system.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. P.\n\nI think the confusion arose from misapplying the formulas, but upon careful calculation, it's clear that the power remains the same when transforming between star and delta connections properly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ P} \\]"
