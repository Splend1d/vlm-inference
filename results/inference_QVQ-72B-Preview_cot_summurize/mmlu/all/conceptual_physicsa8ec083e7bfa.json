                    "text": "So I have this question about radioactive decay. It says that when an element ejects a beta particle, what happens to its atomic number? The options are:\n\nA. reduces by 1\n\nB. increases by 1\n\nC. reduces by 2\n\nD. increases by 2\n\nI need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a beta particle is. I think a beta particle is an electron or a positron emitted during radioactive decay. But most commonly, when people talk about beta particles, they're referring to beta minus decay, where an electron is emitted.\n\nIn beta minus decay, a neutron in the nucleus turns into a proton, an electron (the beta particle), and an antineutrino. So, if a neutron turns into a proton, that means the atomic number, which is the number of protons, increases by one.\n\nWait, let's double-check that. The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus. In beta minus decay, one neutron turns into one proton, so the total number of protons increases by one, and the total number of neutrons decreases by one. So, the atomic number goes up by one.\n\nDoes that mean the atomic number increases by 1? That would be option B.\n\nBut what about beta plus decay? In beta plus decay, a proton turns into a neutron, an electron, and a neutrino. So, in this case, a proton turns into a neutron, meaning the number of protons decreases by one, and the atomic number decreases by one.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"when an element ejects a beta particle,\" and it doesn't specify whether it's beta minus or beta plus decay. Hmm.\n\nBeta minus decay: neutron turns into proton + electron + antineutrino. Atomic number increases by one.\n\nBeta plus decay: proton turns into neutron + positron + neutrino. Atomic number decreases by one.\n\nSo, depending on the type of beta decay, the atomic number can either increase or decrease by one. But since the question doesn't specify the type of beta decay, I need to consider both possibilities.\n\nHowever, in most cases, when people talk about beta decay without specifying, they usually mean beta minus decay, where the atomic number increases by one.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider both scenarios.\n\nLet me see if I can find a general answer that covers both cases.\n\nIn beta minus decay, the atomic number increases by one.\n\nIn beta plus decay, the atomic number decreases by one.\n\nSo, in both cases, the atomic number changes by one, but the direction depends on the type of beta decay.\n\nBut the question seems to suggest that there's a single correct answer, not depending on the type of beta decay.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the question is referring to beta minus decay, which is more common, and in that case, the atomic number increases by one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a trick question to see if I remember that beta plus decay exists and that it decreases the atomic number.\n\nBut I don't think it's a trick question; maybe it's just testing the basic concept.\n\nLet me try to recall the nuclear equations for beta decay.\n\nFor beta minus decay:\n\nn \u2192 p + e\u207b + \u1fcbe\n\nWhere n is a neutron, p is a proton, e\u207b is an electron, and \u1fcbe is an antineutrino.\n\nSo, the atomic number increases by one because a neutron turns into a proton.\n\nFor beta plus decay:\n\np \u2192 n + e\u207a + \u03bde\n\nWhere p is a proton, n is a neutron, e\u207a is a positron, and \u03bde is a neutrino.\n\nHere, the atomic number decreases by one because a proton turns into a neutron.\n\nSo, again, the atomic number changes by one in either direction.\n\nBut the question specifies that an element ejects a beta particle. In both beta minus and beta plus decay, a beta particle is ejected, and the atomic number changes by one.\n\nHowever, the direction (increase or decrease) depends on the type of beta decay.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the question is incomplete because it doesn't specify the type of beta decay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to say that in both cases, the atomic number changes by one, but without specifying the direction, options A and B are both partially correct.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense in the context of multiple-choice questions, where usually only one option is correct.\n\nI think I might be overcomplicating this.\n\nLet's consider that in beta minus decay, which is more common, the atomic number increases by one.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. increases by 1.\n\nI'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
