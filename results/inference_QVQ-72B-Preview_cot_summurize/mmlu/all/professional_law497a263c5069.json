                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about depositions in a civil suit, and I need to figure out which of these statements are true. I'm not a lawyer, but I've heard of depositions before. They're like sworn statements from witnesses or parties in a lawsuit, usually taken before the trial. So, let's break down each statement one by one.\n\nStarting with statement I: \"A deposition of a person against whom another person contemplates filing an action may be compelled by the party contemplating the action, without leave of court, before the action is filed.\"\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. So, if someone is thinking about suing another person, can they force that person to give a deposition before the lawsuit is even filed? And they can do this without asking the court's permission? I'm not sure about this. I thought that depositions are typically part of the discovery process during a lawsuit, not before it's filed. Maybe there are exceptions or specific rules that allow for pre-litigation depositions under certain circumstances. I should look into that.\n\nMoving on to statement II: \"A deposition of the defendant in an action may be taken by the plaintiff without service of a subpoena on the defendant.\"\n\nOkay, so in a ongoing lawsuit, the plaintiff wants to take the defendant's deposition. Normally, when you subpoena someone, you're ordering them to appear and give testimony or produce documents. But here, it says the plaintiff can take the defendant's deposition without serving a subpoena on the defendant. That seems a bit odd. I thought that in a lawsuit, the parties have certain rights and obligations, including responding to discovery requests. Maybe the rules are different for parties versus non-parties. I need to check that.\n\nLastly, statement III: \"A deposition may be taken even though all the testimony secured by it will be inadmissible at the trial.\"\n\nThis one is interesting. So, sometimes depositions are taken to gather information that might not be admissible in court, perhaps for settlement negotiations or to understand the other side's position better. But if the testimony is going to be inadmissible at trial, is there a point to taking the deposition? Maybe for impeachment purposes or to lock someone into a story. I recall that depositions can be used to preserve testimony, even if it's not admissible at trial, but I'm not sure about the specifics here.\n\nAlright, now I need to figure out which of these statements are true. Let me think about each one again.\n\nFor statement I: Can someone compel a deposition before a lawsuit is filed without court permission? I did some quick research, and it seems that in some jurisdictions, there are rules allowing for examinations before action under certain conditions. For example, in federal courts, Rule 27 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows for taking depositions before a lawsuit is filed, but only upon motion and notice, and the court must protect against abuse. So, it's not entirely without court involvement. Maybe the statement is not entirely accurate as phrased.\n\nFor statement II: Can the plaintiff take the defendant's deposition without serving a subpoena? Well, in a lawsuit, once the defendant has been served with the complaint, they are already a party to the action and are obligated to participate in discovery. So, perhaps a subpoena isn't necessary for a party to a lawsuit. Maybe a notice of deposition is sufficient. I need to check the rules on that.\n\nFor statement III: Can a deposition be taken even if the testimony will be inadmissible at trial? I think depositions are primarily for discovery purposes, to find out what witnesses know or have heard about the case. Some of that information might not be admissible at trial, but it can still be useful for preparing the case or negotiating a settlement. So, maybe this statement is true.\n\nLet me see if I can summarize:\n\n- Statement I: Probably not entirely accurate, as there are usually court procedures to follow before compelling a deposition before a lawsuit is filed.\n\n- Statement II: Possibly true, since defendants are already parties to the lawsuit and must comply with discovery requests without needing a subpoena.\n\n- Statement III: Likely true, as depositions serve broader discovery purposes beyond just gathering admissible evidence for trial.\n\nBased on this, it seems that statements II and III are true, while statement I may not be entirely accurate as phrased. Therefore, the correct answer should be C. II and III only.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me double-check.\n\nIn federal civil procedure, Rule 27 allows for taking depositions before an action is filed, but only upon motion and notice, and the court has discretion to grant or deny the motion. So, it's not entirely without leave of court, as statement I suggests. Hence, statement I is not entirely correct.\n\nStatement II: According to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30, depositions of parties can be taken upon notice, and a party does not need to be subpoenaed since they are already obligated to participate in discovery. So, this seems accurate.\n\nStatement III: Depositions can be used for various purposes, including impeachment, even if the testimony isn't admissible at trial. So, it's possible to take a deposition even if the testimony won't be admissible at trial, as it can still be useful for other purposes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. II and III only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
