                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about gender-role identity development. It says that parents who play more roughly with male children and are more protective of female children are most consistent with which theory? The options are Psychodynamic, Social learning, Cognitive development, and Gender schema.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each theory focuses on regarding gender-role identity development.\n\nStarting with the Psychodynamic theory, I recall that this approach emphasizes unconscious motives and conflicts, often rooted in early childhood experiences. It might suggest that parents' interactions with children could influence their gender identity, but I'm not sure if it specifically addresses the way parents play with boys versus girls.\n\nNext, Social learning theory, which is also known as Social cognitive theory, suggests that people learn through observing others and imitating their behaviors. This includes learning gender roles from parents, peers, and the media. Parents serving as models for gender-appropriate behavior could fit into this theory.\n\nCognitive development theory, particularly Piaget's theory, focuses on how children develop intellectually. While it does touch on how children understand the world, including social roles, it might not directly address parental playing styles and protectiveness based on gender.\n\nGender schema theory proposes that once children learn the cultural norms about gender, they start to categorize people and behaviors into male or female categories. This can lead them to adopt behaviors that align with their perceived gender role.\n\nGiven the scenario where parents play more roughly with male children and are more protective of female children, it seems like they are treating boys and girls differently based on gender norms. This differential treatment could be seen as providing different learning opportunities or models for boys and girls.\n\nIn Social learning theory, children learn behaviors by observing and imitating others, especially parents. If parents are rougher with boys and more protective with girls, children might learn that these are acceptable or expected behaviors for their gender.\n\nIn Gender schema theory, children might internalize these behaviors as part of their understanding of what it means to be male or female.\n\nHowever, the direct influence seems to be from the parents' behavior towards the children, which aligns more with Social learning theory, where parents are actively shaping their children's behavior through their own actions and reinforcements.\n\nPsychodynamic theory might explain this through unconscious processes or early attachments, but it doesn't seem as directly applicable to the described behavior.\n\nCognitive development theory would likely focus more on how children come to understand gender roles through their growing cognitive abilities rather than through parental behavior per se.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B. Social learning theory.\n\nBut to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nIn Social learning theory, parental modeling is a key component. Parents are primary role models, and children learn gender-appropriate behaviors by observing and imitating them. So, if parents are rougher with boys and more protective with girls, they are providing models of masculine and feminine behavior, which children can then imitate.\n\nIn contrast, Gender schema theory suggests that children develop a schema of what is male and female and then conform their behavior to fit these schemas. While parental behavior can influence these schemas, the theory places more emphasis on the child's active role in categorizing and conforming to gender roles.\n\nSo, while both theories involve the influence of parental behavior on gender-role identity, Social learning theory more directly addresses the role of parental modeling and reinforcement in shaping children's behavior based on gender.\n\nTherefore, the most consistent theory with the described parental behavior is Social learning theory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
