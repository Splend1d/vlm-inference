The options are:\n\nA. 7x20\n\nB. 8x80\n\nC. 9x80\n\nD. 9x90\n\nAlright, I need to figure out which one of these equals 720. The question is pretty straightforward, but I should make sure I don't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate each option one by one and see which one matches 720.\n\nStarting with option A: 7x20.\n\nHmm, 7 times 20. Well, 7 times 20 is 140. So, 7 times 20 equals 140. That's not 720. So, option A is out.\n\nNext, option B: 8x80.\n\nLet's see, 8 times 80. 8 times 80 is 640. That's still not 720. So, option B is also incorrect.\n\nMoving on to option C: 9x80.\n\nHmm, 9 times 80. Let me calculate that. 9 times 8 is 72, and since it's 80, it's like 9 times 8 tens, which is 72 tens, so 720. Wait, that equals 720. So, this seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be sure, I'll check option D as well.\n\nOption D: 9x90.\n\n9 times 90. Well, 9 times 9 is 81, and since it's 90, it's 9 times 9 tens, which is 81 tens, so 810. That's more than 720, so it's not correct.\n\nSo, after calculating all the options, it seems that option C: 9x80 equals 720.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps by considering if any of these could be interpreted differently, but no, the question is clear: which expression is equal to 720.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the units. For example, 9x80 is indeed 720, because 9 times 8 is 72, and since it's 80, it's 720.\n\nWhereas 9x90 would be 810, which is more than 720.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that option C is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's list out all the calculations again:\n\nA. 7x20 = 140\n\nB. 8x80 = 640\n\nC. 9x80 = 720\n\nD. 9x90 = 810\n\nClearly, option C equals 720.\n\nI think that's it. No need to overthink this one. The answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
