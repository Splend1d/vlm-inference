The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I woke up early and went to hold up the store.\" Hmm, \"hold up the store\" sounds like a robbery. Like, going to a store with the intention to rob it. That definitely seems morally wrong. Robbery is against the law, it involves stealing from others, and it can put people in danger. So, according to ordinary moral standards, that would be considered wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I graded my students' papers regardless of how I felt about them personally.\" Okay, so this is about grading students' papers without letting personal feelings influence the grades. So, if I'm a teacher and I grade my students' papers based on the quality of their work, not on whether I like them or not, that seems fair and professional. In fact, it's what teachers are supposed to do. So, this would be considered not wrong morally.\n\nSo, comparing the two:\n\nScenario 1: Holding up a store \u2013 that's wrong.\n\nScenario 2: Grading students' papers objectively \u2013 that's not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe there's some context I'm missing. In scenario 1, \"hold up the store\" could potentially have another meaning, but in common usage, it means to rob a store. And that's definitely immoral. In scenario 2, grading fairly without bias seems morally acceptable.\n\nSo, yeah, I think B is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
