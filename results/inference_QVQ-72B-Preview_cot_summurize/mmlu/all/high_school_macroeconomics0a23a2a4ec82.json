                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these options aligns with the monetarist point of view. I know that monetarism is an economic theory that emphasizes the role of governments in controlling the amount of money in circulation. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that monetary policy should be used to fine-tune the economy. Hmm, I think monetarists believe in a steady growth in the money supply but not necessarily in using monetary policy to fine-tune the economy. They might prefer a more hands-off approach once the money supply growth is set.\n\nOption B says that crowding out is not a problem. Crowding out refers to the idea that increased government spending can lead to reduced private sector spending, especially through higher interest rates. Monetarists might have a view on this, but I'm not entirely sure if it's a core tenet of their philosophy.\n\nOption C says that the money supply should be increased steadily. This sounds familiar. I recall that monetarists advocate for a gradual and predictable increase in the money supply to avoid inflation or deflation. So, this seems like a possible answer.\n\nOption D says that the velocity of money is unstable. Velocity of money is how quickly money changes hands in an economy. Monetarists, I believe, think that velocity is relatively stable, at least in the long run, which allows them to focus on the money supply. So, if that's the case, they wouldn't agree that it's unstable.\n\nGiven these options, Option C seems to be the most accurate representation of a monetarist viewpoint. They do emphasize a steady increase in the money supply as a way to maintain economic stability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
