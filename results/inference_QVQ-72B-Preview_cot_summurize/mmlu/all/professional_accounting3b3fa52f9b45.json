                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these situations shows inelastic demand. I remember that demand is considered inelastic when the percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in price. In other words, if the price goes up by a certain percentage and the quantity demanded decreases by a smaller percentage, then demand is inelastic.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: A 5% price increase results in a 3% decrease in the quantity demanded. So, here, the price went up by 5%, and the quantity demanded went down by 3%. Since 3% is less than 5%, this suggests that demand is not very responsive to price changes. I think this is an example of inelastic demand.\n\nOption B: A 4% price increase results in a 6% decrease in the quantity demanded. Here, the price went up by 4%, and the quantity demanded decreased by 6%. So, the percentage change in quantity is larger than the percentage change in price. I believe this is elastic demand because the quantity responds more to the price change.\n\nOption C: A 4% price increase results in a 4% decrease in the quantity demanded. Here, both the price and quantity changed by the same percentage. I recall that when the percentage change in quantity is equal to the percentage change in price, the demand is unit elastic. So, this is neither perfectly inelastic nor perfectly elastic; it's somewhere in between.\n\nOption D: A 3% price decrease results in a 5% increase in the quantity demanded. Here, the price went down by 3%, and the quantity demanded went up by 5%. Again, the percentage change in quantity is larger than the percentage change in price, which suggests elastic demand.\n\nSo, based on this, Option A seems to be the best example of inelastic demand because the percentage change in quantity (3%) is less than the percentage change in price (5%).\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"would there be inelastic demand?\" It doesn't specify \"which of the following is an example of inelastic demand?\" It's phrased like a question where maybe one of them is inelastic, but perhaps there could be more than one.\n\nBut looking at the options, Option A is the only one where the percentage change in quantity is less than the percentage change in price. In Option B, the quantity change is greater than the price change, which is elastic. Option C is unit elastic, and Option D is also elastic.\n\nSo, only Option A shows inelastic demand.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think about the formula for price elasticity of demand. It's (percentage change in quantity demanded) divided by (percentage change in price). If this value is less than 1, demand is inelastic. If it's equal to 1, it's unit elastic, and if it's greater than 1, it's elastic.\n\nSo, for Option A: 3% decrease in quantity / 5% increase in price = 0.6, which is less than 1, so inelastic.\n\nOption B: 6% decrease in quantity / 4% increase in price = 1.5, which is greater than 1, so elastic.\n\nOption C: 4% decrease in quantity / 4% increase in price = 1, which is unit elastic.\n\nOption D: 5% increase in quantity / 3% decrease in price = 1.666..., which is greater than 1, so elastic.\n\nTherefore, only Option A has inelastic demand.\n\nI think the answer is Option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
