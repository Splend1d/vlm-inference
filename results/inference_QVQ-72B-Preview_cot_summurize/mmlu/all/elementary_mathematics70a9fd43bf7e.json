                    "text": "So I've got this equation here: -47 equals g plus 24. I need to solve for g, and there are four options to choose from. Let me see... the equation is written as:\n\n\u221247 = g + 24\n\nHmm, I need to isolate g. To do that, I should probably get rid of the 24 that's being added to it. I think I should subtract 24 from both sides of the equation. That should keep the equation balanced.\n\nSo, doing that:\n\n-47 - 24 = g + 24 - 24\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\n-71 = g\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as g plus 24 equals -47. So, g plus 24 equals negative 47. To find g, I need to subtract 24 from negative 47.\n\nLet me do that step by step. Negative 47 minus 24. Negative 47 minus 24 is negative 71.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got before. So, g equals -71.\n\nBut let me see if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Maybe I should consider if the equation is supposed to be read differently, but it looks pretty clear: negative 47 equals g plus 24.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that g is some number added to 24 gives me -47. So, what number do I add to 24 to get to -47?\n\nWell, subtracting 24 from -47 would give me that number.\n\n-47 - 24 is -71, again.\n\nSo, it consistently points to g being -71.\n\nLet me consider if there's any trick here. Maybe the negative sign is placed differently or if there are any parentheses that might affect the operation. But from how it's written, it seems like g is being added to 24, and that equals -47.\n\nUnless there's a mistake in the problem, but assuming it's correctly stated, g should be -71.\n\nWait, maybe I should check by plugging the value back into the equation.\n\nIf g is -71, then:\n\n-71 + 24 equals -47.\n\nLet me calculate that: -71 plus 24.\n\nStarting from -71, adding 24 would move me 24 units to the right on the number line.\n\n-71 to -47 is indeed 24 units apart.\n\nBecause -71 to -47 is the same as going from -71 to -47, which is 24 units (since -71 + 24 = -47).\n\nSo, that checks out.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. \u221271\n\nB. \u221223\n\nC. 23\n\nD. 71\n\nGiven that g equals -71, the correct choice should be A. \u221271.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see what happens if I choose the other options and plug them in.\n\nOption B: \u221223\n\nIf g = -23, then:\n\n-23 + 24 = 1, which does not equal -47.\n\nOption C: 23\n\n23 + 24 = 47, which does not equal -47.\n\nOption D: 71\n\n71 + 24 = 95, which does not equal -47.\n\nSo, none of these other options satisfy the equation, confirming that A. \u221271 is the correct answer.\n\nI think that's solid. No further confusion here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ -71} \\]"
