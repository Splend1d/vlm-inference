                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about the population of the New World at the time of Columbus's arrival. It says that the New World was \"discovered\" by Christopher Columbus and asks how many people were living there at that time. The options are 100,000, 500,000, 1,000,000, or tens of millions.\n\nFirst off, I need to make sure I understand what the New World refers to in this context. Historically, the New World is used to denote the Americas, which include North and South America, as well as Central America and the Caribbean islands. So, essentially, it's the entire Western Hemisphere before the arrival of Europeans.\n\nNow, the question is about the population of this vast region at the time of Columbus's arrival, which is generally accepted to be around 1492. I need to think about the indigenous populations that were living there before European contact.\n\nI recall that there were numerous indigenous civilizations and tribes across the Americas. In North America, there were groups like the Aztecs in Mexico and the Incas in South America, both of which had highly developed societies and large populations. Additionally, there were many other smaller tribes and communities throughout the continents.\n\nI also remember learning about the Cahokia Mounds in present-day Illinois, which suggest that there were significant population centers in North America even before Columbus's arrival.\n\nSo, considering the extent of these civilizations and the vastness of the New World, I would imagine that the population was quite substantial.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 100,000\n\nB. 500,000\n\nC. 1,000,000\n\nD. tens of millions\n\nI have to choose among these estimates.\n\nLet me consider some rough calculations to get a sense of what might be plausible.\n\nFirst, if I think about the population densities of indigenous peoples before European contact, I know that in some areas, like the Aztec and Inca empires, there were dense populations due to advanced agricultural techniques and urban planning.\n\nFor example, the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, is estimated to have had a population of around 200,000 to 300,000 people at its peak, which was before Columbus arrived.\n\nSimilarly, the Inca Empire covered a large portion of South America and is estimated to have had a population ranging from 9 to 16 million people.\n\nNow, besides these two prominent empires, there were many other indigenous groups across both North and South America.\n\nIn North America, there were numerous Native American tribes, including the Cherokee, Navajo, Apache, Sioux, and many others. Each of these tribes had their own territories and populations, which varied in size.\n\nIn Central America, there were the Maya civilizations, which had once thrived and built complex cities and had a rich culture.\n\nConsidering all of this, it seems unlikely that the total population of the New World would be as low as 100,000, 500,000, or even 1,000,000.\n\nLet me try to do some back-of-the-envelope calculations.\n\nIf the Inca Empire alone had, say, 12 million people, and the Aztec Empire had around 25 million (considering the population of Tenochtitlan and the surrounding regions), that already adds up to around 37 million.\n\nThen, adding the populations of other significant groups like the Maya, who at their peak had several million people, and various tribes in North America, which could collectively number in the millions as well.\n\nFor instance, the Cherokee Nation is thought to have had around 20,000 members before the Trail of Tears in the 19th century, but before European contact, their population might have been larger.\n\nSimilarly, the Iroquois Confederacy, consisting of five (later six) tribes, had a combined population that could have been in the hundreds of thousands.\n\nConsidering all of this, it's clear that the total population of the New World was significantly higher than the lower options provided.\n\nMoreover, recent scholarly estimates suggest that the pre-Columbian population of the Americas was quite substantial. Some estimates place the total population at around 50 to 100 million people before Columbus's arrival.\n\nFor example, the Demographic Transition Model suggests that the population of the Americas in 1492 was around 56 million, while other estimates go as high as 100 million or more.\n\nThese figures take into account not only the large empires but also the smaller tribes and communities across the vast expanse of the continents.\n\nGiven this information, it's evident that the correct answer is \"tens of millions.\"\n\nTo further solidify this, I can think about the impact of European colonization and the introduction of diseases like smallpox, measles, and influenza, which decimated indigenous populations. Historians believe that these diseases caused a sharp decline in the native populations, with some estimates suggesting that up to 90% of the indigenous people died due to these illnesses.\n\nThis catastrophic population decline further underscores the fact that the pre-Columbian population was much larger than the lower estimates provided.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence and logical reasoning, the answer should be D. tens of millions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
