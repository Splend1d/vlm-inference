Later in the period, half of the remaining students go to the computer lab. If there are 8 students remaining in the class, how many students were originally in the class?\n\nOkay, let's try to break this down. So, we have some number of students originally in the class, and we'll call that number S. At the beginning, half of them go to the library. So, that means S/2 students go to the library, and the remaining S/2 students stay in the class.\n\nNow, later in the period, half of the remaining students go to the computer lab. So, the remaining students are S/2, and half of that is (S/2)/2, which is S/4. So, S/4 students go to the computer lab.\n\nAfter that, we're left with 8 students in the class. So, the students who stayed initially (S/2) minus those who went to the computer lab (S/4) should equal 8.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nS/2 - S/4 = 8\n\nHmm, now I need to solve for S. To do that, I should combine like terms. S/2 - S/4 is the same as (2S - S)/4, right? Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nLet me think again. S/2 is the same as 2S/4, and S/4 is S/4. So, 2S/4 - S/4 = S/4. So, S/4 = 8.\n\nAlright, so S/4 = 8. To find S, I can multiply both sides by 4: S = 32.\n\nWait a minute, let's check if that makes sense. If there are 32 students originally, half go to the library, so 16 go to the library, and 16 remain. Then, half of the remaining 16 go to the computer lab, so 8 go to the computer lab, leaving 8 students in the class. That matches the problem statement.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to look at it. Maybe I can work backwards. If there are 8 students remaining, and that's half of the students after the library trip, then before the computer lab, there were 8 * 2 = 16 students. And before the library trip, there were 16 * 2 = 32 students.\n\nThat also gives me 32 students originally. Seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let's think about it step by step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOriginal number of students: S.\n\nAfter half go to the library: S/2 remain.\n\nThen, half of the remaining go to the computer lab: (S/2)/2 = S/4 go to the computer lab.\n\nSo, the remaining students are S/2 - S/4 = S/4, and that equals 8.\n\nSo, S/4 = 8, thus S = 32.\n\nYeah, that checks out.\n\nLet me see what the options are:\n\nA. 12 students\n\nB. 16 students\n\nC. 24 students\n\nD. 32 students\n\nSo, D. 32 students seems to be the correct answer.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any flaws in this reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]"
