I remember that formal operational stage is one of Piaget's stages of cognitive development, right? It's the last stage, I think, and it's when people start thinking more like adults, using logic and reasoning in a more abstract way.\n\nOption A says \"simple motor responses to sensory stimuli.\" That sounds more like reflexes or basic sensory-motor coordination, which I think is part of the sensorimotor stage, not formal operational. So, probably not A.\n\nOption B mentions \"failure to understand reversibility.\" Hmm, reversibility is the idea that you can undo actions or processes. In Piaget's theory, children in the preoperational stage have trouble with this concept. So, if they can't understand reversibility, that would be more characteristic of the preoperational stage, not formal operational. So, maybe not B.\n\nOption C says \"capacity to deal well with concrete objects, but not with hypothetical situations.\" This sounds familiar; I think this is actually descriptive of the concrete operational stage. In that stage, kids can handle concrete, real-world situations well, but they struggle with abstract or hypothetical concepts. Formal operational thinking is supposed to be beyond that, where individuals can think about abstract ideas and hypothetical scenarios. So, again, probably not C.\n\nThat leaves option D: \"logical reasoning and systematic planning.\" This seems to align with what I recall about formal operational thinking. In this stage, people can think logically about abstract concepts and can engage in systematic planning. They can consider multiple possibilities and hypotheses, which is a big part of formal operational thought.\n\nJust to make sure, I should think about some examples. For instance, a teenager might be able to consider the consequences of different choices in a complex situation, like deciding on a career path based on various factors like interests, skills, and job market trends. That involves logical reasoning and systematic planning, which fits with option D.\n\nAnother example could be scientific thinking, where someone forms hypotheses, tests them, and draws conclusions based on evidence. That's also a key aspect of formal operational thinking.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option D is the correct choice. Let me just double-check if there's any other aspect I might be missing.\n\nI remember that formal operational thinking also involves the ability to think about abstract concepts, like justice, freedom, or equality, in a more nuanced way. This again points towards logical reasoning and systematic planning being central to this stage.\n\nAdditionally, in formal operational stage, people can handle deductive reasoning, where they start with general principles and apply them to specific instances. For example, if all men are mortal, and Socrates is a man, then Socrates is mortal. This kind of logical reasoning is a hallmark of formal operational thinking.\n\nThey can also think about what could be, not just what is, which involves hypothetical scenarios\u2014another indication of abstract thinking.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I'm confident that option D, logical reasoning and systematic planning, is the characteristic of formal operational thinking.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
