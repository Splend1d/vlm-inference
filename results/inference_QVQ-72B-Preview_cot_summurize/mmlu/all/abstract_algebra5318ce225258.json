                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out these statements about free abelian groups and their bases. I have to decide whether each statement is true or false, and then pick the correct option from the choices given. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a free abelian group is. From my algebra class, I remember that a free abelian group is a group that has a basis, meaning a set of elements such that every element of the group can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of these basis elements with integer coefficients. The rank of the group is the cardinality of this basis.\n\nStatement 1 says: Every nonzero free abelian group has an infinite number of bases.\n\nHmm, okay. So, a nonzero free abelian group means it's not the trivial group consisting of just the identity element. It has some elements in it.\n\nI need to think about whether such a group can have only a finite number of bases or if it always has infinitely many.\n\nLet me consider a simple example. Take the integers under addition, \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). This is a free abelian group of rank 1, and its standard basis is \\(\\{1\\}\\). But could there be other bases?\n\nWell, any nonzero integer can be a basis for \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). For example, \\(\\{2\\}\\), \\(\\{3\\}\\), \\(\\{-1\\}\\), etc. Each of these generates all of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) through integer multiples. So, there are infinitely many bases for \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\): every single nonzero integer forms a basis by itself.\n\nWait, but \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) is infinite, so maybe that's why it has infinitely many bases. But what if the group is finite?\n\nOh, no, free abelian groups are always infinite, right? Wait, no, the trivial group is also considered an abelian group, but it's not free because it doesn't have a basis. So, all free abelian groups are infinite.\n\nBut Statement 1 specifies \"nonzero,\" so it's excluding the trivial group.\n\nSo, in the case of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), which is a free abelian group of rank 1, it has infinitely many bases, as every nonzero integer can serve as a basis.\n\nWhat about free abelian groups of higher rank?\n\nLet's take \\(\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}\\), which is a free abelian group of rank 2. Its standard basis is \\(\\{(1,0), (0,1)\\}\\). But there are other possible bases.\n\nFor example, \\(\\{(1,0), (1,1)\\}\\) is also a basis because any element in \\(\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}\\) can be written as a linear combination of these with integer coefficients.\n\nSimilarly, \\(\\{(2,0), (0,2)\\}\\) is another basis.\n\nIn fact, any pair of linearly independent elements can form a basis. Since there are infinitely many such pairs, it seems like there are infinitely many bases for \\(\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nWait, but maybe there could be a group where the number of bases is finite.\n\nBut considering that even in rank 1, \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) has infinitely many bases, and in higher ranks, it seems even more likely to have infinitely many, I'm starting to think that Statement 1 is true.\n\nLet me try to think of a general argument.\n\nSuppose \\(G\\) is a free abelian group with a basis \\(B = \\{b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n\\}\\), where \\(n\\) is the rank.\n\nIf \\(n = 1\\), then as in the case of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), any nonzero multiple of \\(b_1\\) is a basis. Since there are infinitely many such multiples, there are infinitely many bases.\n\nIf \\(n > 1\\), then the situation is similar. Any set of \\(n\\) linearly independent elements can be a basis. The number of such sets is infinite because, for example, you can scale the elements in the basis in infinitely many ways.\n\nTherefore, it seems that every nonzero free abelian group has an infinite number of bases.\n\nSo, Statement 1 is true.\n\nNow, Statement 2: Every free abelian group of rank at least 2 has an infinite number of bases.\n\nFrom my earlier reasoning, it seems that even groups of rank 1 have infinitely many bases, so certainly, groups of rank at least 2 would also have infinitely many bases.\n\nBut let's be careful. Maybe there's something special about rank 2 and higher that could allow for only finitely many bases.\n\nWait, no. In rank 1, we already have infinitely many bases, and in higher ranks, the possibilities only increase.\n\nMoreover, in higher ranks, you can have more variations in choosing linearly independent sets.\n\nFor example, in \\(\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}\\), any two elements that are not multiples of each other can form a basis.\n\nThere are infinitely many such pairs, so there are infinitely many bases.\n\nSimilarly, for higher ranks, the number of possible bases grows rapidly.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 also seems to be true.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a trick here. Perhaps in some contexts, a free abelian group of rank at least 2 could have only finitely many bases under certain conditions.\n\nHowever, based on my understanding, I don't see a way for a free abelian group to have only finitely many bases.\n\nLet me consider the structure of free abelian groups.\n\nA free abelian group of rank \\(n\\) is isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}^n\\), the direct product of \\(n\\) copies of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nAny basis of \\(\\mathbb{Z}^n\\) corresponds to a unimodular matrix, which is a matrix with integer entries and determinant \\(\\pm 1\\).\n\nThe group of unimodular \\(n \\times n\\) matrices is infinite for \\(n \\geq 1\\), since you can always scale the basis vectors in infinitely many ways while keeping them linearly independent.\n\nTherefore, the number of bases is at least as large as the number of unimodular matrices, which is infinite.\n\nThis reinforces my earlier conclusion that both statements are true.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider a specific example for rank 2.\n\nTake \\(\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}\\), as I did before.\n\nWe can list some bases:\n\n- \\(\\{(1,0), (0,1)\\}\\)\n\n- \\(\\{(1,0), (1,1)\\}\\)\n\n- \\(\\{(2,1), (1,1)\\}\\)\n\n- \\(\\{(1,1), (0,1)\\}\\)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThere are clearly infinitely many such bases.\n\nMoreover, any two linearly independent elements can be a basis, and there are infinitely many choices for such pairs.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nSo, according to my reasoning, both statements are true.\n\nBut let's look back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nSince I concluded that both statements are true, the correct choice should be A. True, True.\n\nHowever, I have a nagging doubt. Maybe there's something I'm missing about the definition of a basis or about the possible number of bases in a free abelian group.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nSuppose we have a free abelian group \\(G\\) of rank \\(n\\).\n\nThe number of bases of \\(G\\) is equivalent to the number of ways to choose \\(n\\) linearly independent elements that generate \\(G\\).\n\nIn \\(\\mathbb{Z}^n\\), the number of bases is infinite because you can always scale the basis vectors by different integers, and as long as the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors is \\(\\pm 1\\), they form a new basis.\n\nThis scaling can be done in infinitely many ways, ensuring an infinite number of bases.\n\nTherefore, it seems impossible for a free abelian group to have only finitely many bases.\n\nHence, both statements are indeed true.\n\nI think I can confidently choose option A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{A}\\]"
