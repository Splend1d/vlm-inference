                    "text": "So I'm dealing with this situation where an audit client has a valid reason for not wanting to confirm a certain account receivable that I've selected for confirmation. I need to figure out what the appropriate course of action is for the auditor in this scenario. The options are:\n\nA. Verify the account balance by inspecting the client's bank statements and cash receipt records.\n\nB. Select at random a different account for confirmation that is approximately the same size.\n\nC. Request the client's management to document the matter in the management representation letter.\n\nD. Explain to the client that the request will most likely cause the auditor to disclaim an opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand why the client might have a valid reason for not confirming a specific account receivable. There could be several reasons, such as the customer being a related party, the account being subject to litigation or dispute, or perhaps there are confidentiality concerns.\n\nGiven that the reason is valid, I need to find an alternative way to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence for that account. Confirmation of accounts receivable is a standard audit procedure because it provides evidence about the existence and accuracy of the receivable balances. However, if confirmation is not feasible or appropriate in a particular case, auditors need to perform alternative procedures.\n\nOption A suggests verifying the account balance by inspecting the client's bank statements and cash receipt records. This could be a viable alternative procedure to confirm the receivable balance indirectly. By examining incoming payments from the customer, the auditor can obtain evidence about the existence and accuracy of the receivable. However, this might not fully address all aspects of the account, such as the aging of the receivable or potential allowances for doubtful debts.\n\nOption B proposes selecting another account at random for confirmation that is roughly the same size. This approach might help maintain the audit's coverage of similar balances, but it doesn't directly address the specific account that couldn't be confirmed. It might be necessary to perform additional procedures for the original account beyond just substituting it with another one.\n\nOption C advises requesting that management documents the matter in the management representation letter. While obtaining representations from management is an important part of the audit, it shouldn't be the primary source of audit evidence, especially for something as significant as accounts receivable. Representations alone are not sufficient to provide reasonable assurance about the account balance.\n\nOption D suggests explaining to the client that the request will likely lead to a disclaimer of opinion. A disclaimer is a severe action, indicating that the auditor hasn't been able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to form an opinion on the financial statements. Given that there are alternative procedures available to address the confirmation issue, jumping straight to a disclaimer seems premature.\n\nConsidering these options, it seems that Option A is the most appropriate first step. Verifying the account balance through inspection of bank statements and cash receipt records could provide the necessary evidence to support the receivable balance. This approach aligns with generally accepted auditing standards, which allow for alternative procedures when confirmations cannot be obtained.\n\nHowever, I should also consider whether this alternative procedure is sufficient to address the specific risks associated with the account. For example, if the reason for not confirming the account is due to a dispute with the customer, simply looking at cash receipts might not fully address the collectability of the receivable. In such a case, the auditor might need to perform additional procedures, such as reviewing correspondence with the customer, assessing the client's allowance for doubtful accounts, or discussing the matter with legal counsel.\n\nMoreover, if the account is material to the financial statements, the auditor needs to ensure that the alternative procedures are comprehensive enough to mitigate the risk of material misstatement. If, after performing these alternative procedures, the auditor still has concerns about the account, then it might be necessary to consider the implications for the audit opinion.\n\nIn summary, the initial step should be to perform alternative audit procedures, such as inspecting bank statements and cash receipt records (Option A), to obtain evidence about the account balance. This should be supplemented with other procedures as necessary to address specific risks related to the account. Only if these procedures are insufficient should the auditor consider the potential impact on the audit opinion, which could range from qualifying the opinion to disclaiming it, depending on the circumstances.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
