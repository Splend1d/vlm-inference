To celebrate passing, the graduate went out with a few friends to a popular campus bar. The graduate's friend ordered a round of Hula Girls for everyone. A Hula Girl is an extremely potent alcoholic drink consisting. of 2 ounces of dry gin, 1 ounce of French vermouth, and 1 teaspoon of grenadine. After the drink is mixed, it is then served in a glass with an inverted lemon peel, which is cut at the ends to represent a grass skirt. Although the graduate had never heard of a Hula Girl, she was in a festive mood and drank it, anyway. A few minutes later, the graduate became very dizzy and attempted to stand up from the barstool. As she tried to walk to the restroom, she became nauseated and vomited over a customer sitting at a nearby table. The customer was embarrassed and greatly humiliated by the incident. If the customer asserts a claim against the graduate, the plaintiff will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the graduate's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\nB. prevail, because an offensive touching resulted.\nC. not prevail, because the graduate's actions were involuntary.\nD. not prevail, because the graduate was unaware what she was drinking.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out if the customer who got vomited on can successfully sue the graduate. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nFirst, the graduate passed the bar exam\u2014congrrats to her! She went out with friends to celebrate and had this really strong drink called a Hula Girl. It's made with gin, vermouth, and grenadine, and it's supposed to be pretty potent. The graduate drank it, felt dizzy, tried to walk to the restroom, and ended up vomiting over a customer sitting nearby. The customer felt embarrassed and humiliated by this incident.\n\nNow, if the customer decides to sue the graduate, what kind of claim might they bring? The options are:\n\nA. Prevail, because the graduate's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\n\nB. Prevail, because an offensive touching resulted.\n\nC. Not prevail, because the graduate's actions were involuntary.\n\nD. Not prevail, because the graduate was unaware of what she was drinking.\n\nAlright, let's think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Extreme and outrageous conduct. This sounds like a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. For that, the conduct has to be truly beyond the bounds of decency, like something that no reasonable person should have to endure. Vomiting over someone is definitely unpleasant, but is it extreme and outrageous? Maybe not to the level of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Plus, the graduate didn't intend to vomit on the customer; it was an accident due to her being intoxicated.\n\nOption B: Offensive touching. This sounds like a battery claim. Battery is the intentional touching of another person without their consent in an offensive manner. But here, the graduate didn't intentionally vomit on the customer; it was an accidental result of her intoxication. So, if it was accidental, can it still be considered battery? Probably not, because intent is a key element in battery.\n\nOption C: Not prevail because the graduate's actions were involuntary. This seems interesting. If the graduate's actions were involuntary, meaning she didn't consciously choose to vomit on the customer, maybe that could be a defense against liability. But does that mean the customer wouldn't prevail? Well, in tort law, involuntary actions might mitigate damages or affect liability, depending on the circumstances.\n\nOption D: Not prevail because the graduate was unaware of what she was drinking. This seems a bit of a stretch. Just because she didn't know what was in the drink doesn't necessarily excuse her from liability if she caused harm to someone else.\n\nHmm, none of these seem perfectly clear. Let me consider the possible causes of action here.\n\nFirst, the customer was humiliated and embarrassed by the incident. So, they might consider claims related to emotional distress. But as I thought earlier, intentional infliction of emotional distress might be a stretch because the conduct wasn't intentional.\n\nWhat about negligence? The graduate drank a very strong drink, became intoxicated, and as a result, vomited on the customer. Maybe the customer could argue that the graduate was negligent in consuming such a strong drink and not being careful about her actions. Negligence requires a duty of care, breach of that duty, and resulting damages. The graduate had a duty to not harm others, she breached that duty by drinking to the point of vomiting on someone, and the customer suffered embarrassment and humiliation as a result.\n\nBut the question is about whether the customer will most likely prevail, and the options are about extreme and outrageous conduct, offensive touching, involuntary actions, and unawareness of the drink's contents.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the customer could sue for assault or battery. Assault is the threat of harmful or offensive contact, and battery is the actual harmful or offensive contact. Here, the vomiting was the actual contact, so it would be battery. But as I thought before, the graduate didn't intend to vomit on the customer; it was an accident. In tort law, battery typically requires intent, so maybe the customer couldn't succeed on that claim.\n\nWhat about strict liability? Sometimes, strict liability applies to certain activities that are inherently dangerous. Drinking and getting intoxicated isn't generally considered an ultrahazardous activity, so that might not apply here.\n\nLet me consider the defense of involuntary action. If the graduate's actions were involuntary, meaning she couldn't control her vomiting due to intoxication, maybe that could be a defense in some tort claims. However, in most jurisdictions, intoxication isn't a valid defense to tortious conduct because you're responsible for your actions even if you're intoxicated.\n\nWait, but if the vomiting was truly involuntary, meaning she couldn't control it, would that affect liability? It's tricky. In some cases, if an act is involuntary and the person couldn't control it, it might not be considered a voluntary act, and therefore, there might be no liability. But again, intoxication is generally seen as a voluntary act, and you're responsible for the consequences of your intoxication.\n\nSo, if the graduate chose to drink the Hula Girl, and as a result of her intoxication, she vomited on someone, she's still liable for the harm caused, even if the vomiting was involuntary.\n\nGiven that, option C seems incorrect because the graduate's actions, while involuntary in the sense that she couldn't control the vomiting, were a result of her voluntary intoxication.\n\nOption D suggests that because she was unaware of what she was drinking, she shouldn't be liable. But again, ignorance of the drink's contents doesn't excuse her from the consequences of her intoxication. She chose to drink it, regardless of whether she knew what was in it.\n\nSo, option D also seems incorrect.\n\nOption A mentions extreme and outrageous conduct. As I thought earlier, vomiting over someone is unpleasant but may not rise to the level of extreme and outrageous conduct required for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The graduate didn't intend to vomit on the customer; it was an accidental result of her intoxication.\n\nOption B is about offensive touching, which aligns with battery. But since the act was accidental, it's unlikely to meet the intent requirement for battery.\n\nSo, neither A nor B seem to fit perfectly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is that the customer will not prevail because the graduate's actions were involuntary, despite what I thought earlier about intoxication being a voluntary act.\n\nBut wait, I need to think more carefully about this.\n\nIn tort law, when someone is intoxicated and causes harm, they are generally held responsible for their actions because getting intoxicated is a voluntary act. So, even if the specific act that caused harm was involuntary (like vomiting), the chain of events was set in motion by the voluntary act of drinking.\n\nTherefore, the graduate would likely be held liable for the harm caused to the customer.\n\nGiven that, neither option C nor D seem correct.\n\nOption A suggests that the conduct was extreme and outrageous, which may not be the case here.\n\nOption B says that an offensive touching resulted, which aligns with battery.\n\nBut, as I thought before, battery requires intent, and the vomiting was accidental.\n\nHowever, in some jurisdictions, if the intoxication is voluntary, the defendant is still liable for the natural consequences of their intoxication, even if the specific act was accidental.\n\nSo, perhaps the customer could prevail on a battery claim, arguing that the graduate should have foreseen the risks of drinking to intoxication.\n\nAlternatively, the customer could bring a negligence claim, arguing that the graduate was negligent in becoming intoxicated and, as a result, caused harm.\n\nBut since the options don't include negligence, perhaps the closest is option B, prevailing on an offensive touching claim.\n\nBut I'm still unsure because of the intent requirement in battery.\n\nMaybe I need to consider another angle.\n\nWhat if the customer claims assault and battery? Assault is the threat of battery, and battery is the harmful or offensive contact.\n\nHere, there was no threat; it was an accidental contact.\n\nSo, assault doesn't seem to apply, and battery typically requires intent.\n\nTherefore, option B might not be the best choice.\n\nPerhaps the customer would most likely not prevail because the graduate's actions were involuntary, despite the voluntary intoxication.\n\nBut that seems contradictory.\n\nLet me check a legal principle here.\n\nIn tort law, voluntary intoxication is not a defense to intentional torts like battery. So, even if the graduate was too intoxicated to intend the vomiting, her voluntary intoxication would not excuse her from liability for battery.\n\nTherefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D is about the graduate being unaware of what she was drinking. Even if she didn't know the strength of the drink, she still chose to drink it, and voluntary intoxication is generally not a defense.\n\nSo, option D is also incorrect.\n\nOption A suggests that the conduct was extreme and outrageous. As I thought earlier, vomiting over someone is embarrassing and humiliating, but it may not reach the level of extreme and outrageous conduct required for intentional infliction of emotional distress, especially since the conduct was accidental.\n\nOption B is about offensive touching, which is battery, and as discussed, the graduate may be liable for battery despite the lack of specific intent due to voluntary intoxication.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the customer will most likely prevail on the offensive touching claim.\n\nSo, the answer is B. Prevail, because an offensive touching resulted.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure, so I might need to double-check this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer could bring a negligence claim, but since that's not among the options, maybe battery is the way to go.\n\nYes, I think B is the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
