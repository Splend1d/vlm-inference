                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"As my roommate slept, I deleted his essay.\" So, while my roommate was sleeping, I deleted an essay that belongs to him. Hmm, that sounds pretty bad. Deleting someone else's work without their permission seems like a deliberate act to cause harm or at least be very inconvenient for them. Essays are usually important, especially if they're for school or work. So, by deleting it, I'm potentially causing my roommate to fail a class or miss a deadline, which could have serious consequences for him.\n\nBut maybe there's a reason why I did it. Wait, the scenario doesn't provide any context for why I deleted the essay. Maybe I was angry with my roommate and did it out of spite. Or maybe I thought it was a draft and didn't realize it was the final version. But even then, deleting someone else's work without checking first is risky and irresponsible.\n\nAnother thought: maybe I deleted it accidentally. But the scenario says \"I deleted his essay,\" which seems intentional. If it was an accident, I would probably say something like \"I accidentally deleted his essay\" or \"I deleted his essay by mistake.\" Since it's phrased as just \"I deleted his essay,\" it seems like it was a deliberate action.\n\nSo, deliberate deletion of someone else's work without their consent is generally considered morally wrong, right? It's akin to vandalism or sabotage, which are not okay according to most moral standards.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: \"While driving down the road, I ran over a speed bump.\" Okay, so I'm driving and I went over a speed bump. Speed bumps are those raised strips on the road designed to slow down drivers. Running over one isn't necessarily a bad thing; it's just part of driving on that road.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Did I damage my car by going too fast over the speed bump? Well, that would be more of a consequence for me rather than something morally wrong. If I damaged my own property through careless driving, that's unfortunate, but it's not necessarily a moral issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I hit the speed bump so hard that it caused damage to the road or to someone else's property. But the scenario doesn't specify any harm beyond just running over the speed bump.\n\nIn general, running over a speed bump is something drivers are supposed to do, albeit slowly to avoid damage. So, unless I was driving recklessly or causing harm to others, running over a speed bump isn't morally wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a pedestrian or another vehicle involved. But no, the scenario only mentions running over a speed bump, nothing else.\n\nSo, based on the information given, running over a speed bump isn't morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, scenario 1 is wrong, and scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nIn scenario 1, deleting someone's essay without their consent is clearly wrong because it's interfering with their work and could cause them significant harm or inconvenience. It's equivalent to destroying their property intentionally, which is both legally and morally problematic.\n\nIn scenario 2, running over a speed bump is a common driving experience. Speed bumps are there to make drivers slow down, and running over them is just part of navigating the road. Unless there's some specific context where it's dangerous or against the law, it's not morally wrong.\n\nSo, yeah, I think B. Wrong, Not wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
