                    "text": "So I have this question here about Turner's syndrome and hemophilia. It says that females with Turner's syndrome have a high incidence of hemophilia, which is a recessive, X-linked trait. And I need to figure out what that implies about their chromosomes. The options are:\n\nA. They have an extra X chromosome\n\nB. They have an extra Y chromosome\n\nC. They lack an X chromosome\n\nD. They have red blood cells that clump\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall what Turner's syndrome is. I think it's a chromosomal condition that affects females, right? Let me see... Oh, yeah, I remember now. Turner's syndrome is typically caused by a partial or complete missing of one X chromosome in females. So, normally, females have two X chromosomes (XX), but in Turner's syndrome, one of those X chromosomes is missing or partially deleted.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then option A, having an extra X chromosome, would mean they have three X chromosomes, which I think is actually Triple X syndrome, not Turner's. So, that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B says they have an extra Y chromosome. Turner's syndrome is associated with having only one X chromosome, not with having an extra Y. In fact, having an extra Y chromosome is another condition called Klinefelter syndrome, which affects males. So, that can't be it.\n\nOption C says they lack an X chromosome. That sounds more like Turner's syndrome. But wait, is it lacking one X chromosome entirely, or is it just partially missing? I need to be precise here.\n\nLet me double-check. Turner's syndrome is characterized by a female having a single X chromosome, often written as X0, meaning they have one X chromosome and no second X. Sometimes, there might be mosaicism, where some cells have one X and others have two X chromosomes, but the classic case is the X0 complement.\n\nSo, in that case, they do lack one X chromosome. That would make sense with option C.\n\nBut let's consider option D: they have red blood cells that clump. Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder, not typically associated with red blood cell clumping. Red blood cell clumping sounds more like something seen in conditions like sickle cell anemia or thalassemia, where the shape of the red blood cells is abnormal, causing them to clump together and block blood flow. But hemophilia is about blood clotting factors, specifically factor VIII or IX, which are missing or defective.\n\nSo, option D doesn't seem relevant to hemophilia or Turner's syndrome.\n\nNow, the question mentions that hemophilia is a recessive, X-linked trait. Normally, in females who have two X chromosomes, hemophilia would only be expressed if both X chromosomes carry the mutated gene, making them carriers. But in Turner's syndrome, where there's only one X chromosome, if that single X chromosome carries the hemophilia gene, there's no second X to provide a normal copy of the gene. Therefore, the individual would express the hemophilia trait.\n\nSo, this makes sense because in Turner's syndrome, with only one X chromosome, any X-linked recessive disorder present on that single X chromosome would be expressed, as there's no corresponding normal allele on a second X chromosome to mask it.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, it can be inferred that females with Turner's syndrome lack an X chromosome, which aligns with option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that other options could be correct.\n\nOption A: extra X chromosome \u2013 that's not Turner's syndrome; it's more like Triple X syndrome, which is different.\n\nOption B: extra Y chromosome \u2013 that's Klinefelter syndrome in males, not Turner's syndrome in females.\n\nOption D: red blood cells clumping \u2013 not related to hemophilia or Turner's syndrome.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: they lack an X chromosome.\n\nJust to cross-verify, I'll think about the genetic makeup:\n\n- Normal female: XX\n\n- Turner's syndrome: X0 (i.e., only one X chromosome)\n\n- Hemophilia is X-linked recessive, so with only one X chromosome, if it carries the hemophilia gene, the individual will express the trait.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
