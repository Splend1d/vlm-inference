                    "text": "So I have this question about contract law, and it's asking which of these circumstances generally causes a discharge of contractual duties by operation of law. The options are novation, accord and satisfaction, anticipatory repudiation, and impossibility of performance. I need to figure out which one of these typically leads to the discharge of contractual duties without any action from the parties involved.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"discharge of contractual duties by operation of law\" means. I think it means that the obligations under the contract are ended or excused due to some event or circumstance, and this happens automatically according to the law, without the parties having to do anything specific to terminate the contract.\n\nSo, let's go through each option one by one.\n\n**A. Novation.**\n\nI recall that novation is when one contract is replaced by another contract, usually involving a new party. In a novation, the original contract is discharged by agreement of the parties and the creation of a new contract. However, this seems like it's done by agreement of the parties rather than by operation of law. So, maybe it's not the best answer.\n\n**B. Accord and satisfaction.**\n\nAccord and satisfaction involves agreeing to accept a different performance than what was originally contracted for, especially when there's a dispute about the original obligations. For example, if someone owes you $100, but you agree to settle for $80 to avoid the hassle of going to court. Here, it's more about the parties agreeing to modify their obligations rather than the law automatically discharging them.\n\n**C. Anticipatory repudiation.**\n\nThis is when one party declares in advance that they will not perform their contractual duties when the time comes. It allows the other party to treat the contract as breached before the performance was due. However, this doesn't necessarily discharge the contractual duties immediately; it just gives the non-breaching party the option to sue for breach of contract or seek other remedies. It doesn't automatically discharge the duties by operation of law.\n\n**D. Impossibility of performance.**\n\nThis refers to situations where, due to some unforeseen event, it becomes objectively impossible to perform the contractual duties. For example, if a contract is to deliver a specific item, and that item is destroyed in a fire, it becomes impossible to deliver it. In such cases, the law may discharge the parties from their obligations because the purpose of the contract can no longer be fulfilled.\n\nConsidering all this, impossibility of performance seems to be the circumstance that generally causes a discharge of contractual duties by operation of law. It's not dependent on the parties' agreements or actions but is recognized by the law as a reason to excuse performance.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check. Is impossibility always discharged by operation of law? What if the impossibility is temporary or partial? Maybe there are exceptions.\n\nLet me think about it more carefully. In contract law, when performance becomes objectively impossible, meaning no one could perform the contracted duty under the circumstances, the law generally discharges the obligations automatically. This can happen due to the destruction of the subject matter, the death or incapacity of a person essential to the performance, or due to new laws that make the performance illegal.\n\nOn the other hand, if the impossibility is only subjective, meaning only one party cannot perform but others could, that doesn't generally discharge the obligations.\n\nAlso, there's a related concept called \"frustration of purpose,\" where the underlying reason for the contract is destroyed, but performance is still possible. This can also lead to discharge of obligations, but it's not exactly the same as impossibility of performance.\n\nGiven the options, impossibility of performance seems to be the most straightforward answer for discharge by operation of law. Novation, accord and satisfaction, and anticipatory repudiation all involve some level of agreement or action by the parties, whereas impossibility of performance is something that happens regardless of the parties' intentions, imposed by the law due to changed circumstances.\n\nSo, my best answer is D. Impossibility of performance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
