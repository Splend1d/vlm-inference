It says, \"According to Kant, nothing can be called 'good' without qualification except ____.\" And the options are right action, good consequences, happiness, or a good will. Hmm, I need to recall what Kant said about goodness and moral worth.\n\nI remember that Kant was a big deal in ethics, especially with his categorical imperative and all that. He believed in duty and acting out of principle rather than for personal gain or happiness. So, let's think about each option one by one.\n\nFirst, right action. Kant did emphasize acting according to duty and moral law, but does he consider that as inherently good without any qualifications? Maybe, but I think he had more to say about the motives behind actions rather than just the actions themselves.\n\nNext, good consequences. This sounds a lot like utilitarianism, where the morality of an action is determined by its outcomes. But Kant was critical of this approach. He thought that the intentions behind actions are more important than their consequences. So, probably not good without qualification.\n\nHappiness\u2014that's a tricky one. Kant did mention that humans naturally seek happiness, but he also thought that pursuing happiness shouldn't be the primary guide for moral action. In fact, he suggested that acting solely based on desire for happiness might lead to immoral behavior. So, again, probably not the answer.\n\nLastly, a good will. Now, this rings a bell. I think Kant placed a lot of importance on the goodness of the will behind actions. He might have said that a good will is the only thing that's unconditionally good.\n\nLet me double-check that. I recall a passage where Kant says, \"There is only one good, namely, the good will.\" Yeah, that sounds familiar. He believed that even if someone's intentions are good, but their actions lead to bad consequences, the goodness of the will still holds value.\n\nSo, based on that, it seems like the correct answer is D. a good will.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other options could possibly fit. Right action\u2014well, Kant did value actions done out of duty, but he also distinguished between actions done from duty and those done with duty, meaning actions done for the right reasons versus the right actions done for self-interested reasons. So, the action itself isn't inherently good without considering the motive.\n\nGood consequences\u2014Kant was against evaluating the morality of an action based solely on its outcomes. He argued that this could justify means that are inherently wrong. So, no, good consequences aren't good without qualification according to Kant.\n\nHappiness\u2014while it's something people desire, Kant didn't consider it the ultimate good. He thought that happiness could be pursued, but it shouldn't be the sole guiding principle of moral action.\n\nTherefore, the only option that fits Kant's philosophy is a good will. It's the only thing that's good in itself, without needing any further qualification or context.\n\nI think I'm confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
