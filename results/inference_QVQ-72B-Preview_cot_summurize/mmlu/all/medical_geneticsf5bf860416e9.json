                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about female pseudohermaphroditism, and I need to pick which one of these options causes it. The options are androgen insensitivity, campomelic dysplasia, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and Klinefelter syndrome. Okay, first things first, I need to understand what female pseudohermaphroditism is. From what I recall, pseudohermaphroditism is when an individual's gonadal sex doesn't match their phenotypic sex. Specifically, in female pseudohermaphroditism, the person has female gonads (ovaries) but may have ambiguous genitalia that resemble male characteristics.\n\nSo, let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Androgen insensitivity. I think this is a condition where the body can't respond to male hormones called androgens. Usually, this is seen in people who are genetically male (XY) but have female-like genitalia. Wait, but the question is about female pseudohermaphroditism, which is about females with ambiguous genitalia. Hmm, maybe not the right choice.\n\nOption B: Campomelic dysplasia. I'm not very familiar with this, but I think it's a rare genetic disorder that affects bone development, particularly the limbs and skull. It can also be associated with abnormalities in sex development. I need to look into whether it causes female pseudohermaphroditism specifically.\n\nOption C: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). I have heard of this before. It's a group of disorders where the adrenal glands produce too much male hormones, which can cause masculinization in females. I think this can lead to ambiguous genitalia in female babies, making their genitals appear more male-like. This sounds like it could be a cause of female pseudohermaphroditism.\n\nOption D: Klinefelter syndrome. I believe this is a condition where males have an extra X chromosome, typically XXY instead of XY. It's associated with underdeveloped testicles and sometimes feminized features, but I think it's more about male pseudohermaphroditism rather than female.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is the most likely cause of female pseudohermaphroditism among these options. Let me just double-check.\n\nIn androgen insensitivity, the individual is typically genetically male but has female characteristics, which would be male pseudohermaphroditism. Campomelic dysplasia does involve skeletal abnormalities and can affect sex development, but I don't recall it specifically causing female pseudohermaphroditism. Klinefelter syndrome is clearly related to males having an extra X chromosome, which isn't directly related to female pseudohermaphroditism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C: congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
