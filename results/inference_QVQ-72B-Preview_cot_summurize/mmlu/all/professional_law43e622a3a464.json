However, on May 12, the retailer read an article on the internet, published by a reputable site that reports coin collecting news, concerning the collector's sale of her coin collection to the novice collector. After reading the article, the retailer immediately sent an e-mail to the collector accepting her offer to buy the coin collection. This e-mail was read by the collector that same afternoon, May 12.

On May 1, they send a letter to a retailer who's been eyeing the collection, offering to sell it for $50,000 and giving them until May 15 to decide. The retailer gets this letter on May 3.\n\nNow, on May 10, before the retailer has made up their mind, the collector goes ahead and sells the collection to a novice collector for $60,000. Ouch! That's a bit of a sneaky move, but hey, business is business.\n\nThe next day, May 11, the collector sends another letter to the retailer, apologizing for selling the collection. This letter reaches the retailer on May 13. But here's the twist: on May 12, the retailer stumbles upon an article on a reputable coin collecting news website that reports the sale of the collection to the novice collector.\n\nFeeling betrayed, perhaps, the retailer immediately sends an email on May 12, accepting the original offer to buy the collection for $50,000. The collector reads this email that same afternoon, May 12.\n\nNow, the question is whether this email from the retailer to the collector on May 12 is effective as an acceptance of the offer to buy the collection.\n\nLet's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have an offer from the collector to the retailer, made on May 1, to sell the collection for $50,000, with an acceptance period until May 15. This offer is received by the retailer on May 3.\n\nAn offer can be revoked any time before acceptance, unless there's a consideration provided for keeping the offer open. In this case, the collector gave the retailer until May 15 to decide, but didn't specify any consideration for keeping the offer open. So, generally, the offer can be revoked until accepted.\n\nHowever, the collector sold the collection to someone else on May 10, which might be considered a revocation of the offer to the retailer.\n\nBut wait, the collector sent a letter on May 11 informing the retailer of this sale, which was received on May 13. So, the retailer didn't know about the sale until May 12, when they read the news article.\n\nSo, when the retailer sent their acceptance email on May 12, did they know that the offer had been revoked? Because if they did, their acceptance might not be valid.\n\nBut hold on, they read the article on May 12, which reported the sale to the novice collector. So, they knew about the sale before they sent their acceptance.\n\nWait a minute, if they knew the offer had been revoked because the collection was sold, does that mean their acceptance is invalid?\n\nWell, generally, if an offeree learns that the offer has been revoked, their acceptance is\u65e0\u6548 because they're accepting an offer that no longer exists.\n\nBut in this case, the retailer learned about the sale on May 12, and sent their acceptance the same day. So, they knew the offer had been revoked when they accepted.\n\nWait, but the collector's letter informing the retailer of the sale was sent on May 11 and received on May 13, but the retailer already knew about the sale on May 12 from the news article.\n\nSo, does the retailer's knowledge from the news article terminate their power to accept the offer?\n\nI think so. Once the offeree learns that the offer has been revoked, their power to accept is terminated.\n\nTherefore, when the retailer sent their acceptance on May 12, they already knew the offer had been revoked, so their acceptance is not effective.\n\nBut let's look at the options provided:\n\nA. Yes, because the collector's May 11 letter did not effectuate a revocation, since it was not received by the retailer until May 13.\n\nWell, but the retailer learned about the sale on May 12 from the news article, which is an external source. So, even though the collector's letter wasn't received until May 13, the retailer already knew about the sale on May 12. So, their power to accept was terminated upon learning about the revocation.\n\nB. Yes, because consideration is not necessary under the UCC for the creation of a sale of goods contract.\n\nHmm, but this seems unrelated to the issue at hand. The UCC generally deals with sales of goods, and while coins could be considered goods, this seems like a contract for the sale of a collection, which might be governed by general contract law rather than the UCC specifically. Moreover, the question is about acceptance of an offer, not about the necessity of consideration.\n\nC. No, because the collector's sale of the coin collection on May 10 terminated the retailer's power of acceptance.\n\nThis seems plausible. When the collector sold the collection to the novice collector on May 10, that action revoked the previous offer to the retailer. However, the retailer didn't know about this sale until May 12. So, their power to accept was terminated upon learning about the sale.\n\nD. No, because the retailer's reading the article on the internet on May 12 terminated the retailer's power of acceptance.\n\nThis also seems correct. The retailer's knowledge of the sale terminates their power to accept the offer.\n\nBut between C and D, which one is more accurate?\n\nOption C suggests that the sale itself terminated the power of acceptance, implying that the offer was revoked by the act of selling the collection to another party.\n\nOption D suggests that it's the retailer's knowledge of the sale that terminates their power to accept.\n\nI think both are relevant, but in contract law, it's generally the offeree's knowledge or constructive knowledge that terminates their power to accept.\n\nSo, in this case, the retailer learned about the sale on May 12, which is when their power to accept was terminated.\n\nTherefore, when they sent their acceptance on May 12, after having learned about the sale, their acceptance is not effective.\n\nSo, the correct answer is likely D: No, because the retailer's reading the article on the internet on May 12 terminated the retailer's power of acceptance.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIs there any possibility that the acceptance is effective despite the retailer's knowledge of the revocation?\n\nNo, because once the offeree knows that the offer has been revoked, accepting the offer is meaningless because the offer no longer exists.\n\nMoreover, the collector's sale to the novice collector on May 10 effectively revoked the previous offer to the retailer, even if the retailer didn't know about it until later.\n\nBut in this scenario, the retailer did learn about the sale before sending their acceptance, so their acceptance is definitely ineffective.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
