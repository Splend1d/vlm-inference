George III. Hmm, I need to figure out which one was the king during the American Revolution.\n\nFirst off, I know that the American Revolution was in the late 18th century. I think it started around 1775 and ended in 1783, but I might be a bit off. Anyway, it was in the 1700s.\n\nNow, I need to recall which British monarch was reigning during that period. Let me think about the sequence of British kings.\n\nI know that the Stuart kings were James I, Charles I, Charles II, and James II. Then there was William and Mary, and after that, the Hanoverians: George I, George II, and George III.\n\nWait, I think the Hanoverians were the ones who were also kings of Great Britain, right? And the American Revolution happened under one of them.\n\nLet me see: James I was a Stuart king, Charles I was also Stuart, and he was beheaded. Then came Charles II, James II, William and Mary, and then the Hanoverians.\n\nSo, the Hanoverians started with George I, then George II, and then George III. Now, when was George III's reign?\n\nI think George III became king in the mid-18th century. Let me see if I can remember the exact years.\n\nGeorge I was from 1714 to 1727, George II from 1727 to 1760, and then George III from 1760 onwards. Yes, that sounds right.\n\nSo, George III became king in 1760, and the American Revolution started in 1775, which is during his reign. So, that would make George III the king at that time.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me think if there was any change in monarchs during the American Revolution. No, I don't think so. George III was king throughout the entire period of the American Revolution.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. George III.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Sometimes, there can be multiple kings with the same name, but in this case, they are all different people.\n\nLet me also consider if the American Revolution had any impact on the monarchy. I know that after the revolution, the British monarchy didn't change much in terms of the line of succession. So, George III remained king.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also think about some significant events during the American Revolution and see if they align with George III's reign.\n\nFor example, the Boston Tea Party happened in 1773, which is before the revolution started, and George III was already on the throne by then.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence was in 1776, still during his reign.\n\nAnd the war ended in 1783, with the Treaty of Paris, and George III was still king.\n\nSo, yeah, it seems pretty clear that George III was the English king during the American Revolution.\n\nI don't think it was Charles I, because he was executed in the 17th century, I believe.\n\nJames I was in the early 17th century, and Edward III was way back in the 14th century, I think.\n\nSo, no, those other options don't fit the time period at all.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. George III.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\text{ George III}} \\]"
