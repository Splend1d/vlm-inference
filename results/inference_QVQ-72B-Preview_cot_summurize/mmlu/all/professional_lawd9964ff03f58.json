He admitted to killing her, but asserted that he lacked the intent to murder, due to his suffering from a personality disorder complicated by two days of drinking alcohol heavily. The trial judge instructed the jury that \"the law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts.\" The judge did not tell them that they had a choice or could infer another conclusion; they were told only that the law presumed it. The accused was convicted of depraved heart murder and sentenced to 100 years in prison. On appeal, the appellant argued that the court took the fact-finding task of determining criminal intent out of the jury's hands by in effect ordering them to find intent. The jury could have felt that they were being told that they had no other choice. The state supreme court affirmed the conviction, but the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari. Will the Court likely reverse the conviction?\n\nA. Yes, because the wording of the instruction could have been viewed by jurors as a mandatory direction to find that there was intent to murder.\nB. Yes, because the wording in effect caused the defendant to be a witness against himself by having him intend everything that he did.\nC. No, because the defendant could raise an argument to rebut the permissible inference created by the jury instruction.\nD. No, because the instruction was only a presumption that the jury did not have to consider in its deliberations.\n"

                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this case. The defendant was charged with intentionally murdering his former girlfriend. He admitted to killing her but said he didn't have the intent to murder because he has a personality disorder and had been drinking heavily for two days. The trial judge told the jury that \"the law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts.\" But the judge didn't tell them that they could choose or infer something else; they were only told that the law presumes it. So, the defendant was convicted of depraved heart murder and sentenced to 100 years in prison. On appeal, the defendant argued that the court took the job of deciding whether there was criminal intent away from the jury by basically telling them to find intent. The state supreme court agreed with the conviction, but the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the case. Now, I need to figure out whether the U.S. Supreme Court is likely to reverse the conviction based on the options given.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the issue is here. The problem seems to be with the jury instruction regarding intent. The judge said that the law presumes a person intends the ordinary consequences of their voluntary acts. But the defendant claims that he didn't have the intent to murder because of his personality disorder and heavy drinking. So, the key seems to be whether the jury was properly instructed on how to determine the defendant's intent.\n\nOption A says that the Court will likely reverse the conviction because the wording of the instruction could have been viewed by jurors as a mandatory direction to find that there was intent to murder. So, if the instruction was phrased in a way that it seemed like the jury had to find intent based on the presumption, and couldn't consider other evidence or arguments about the defendant's state of mind, that could be a problem. The defendant's appeal suggests that the jury might have felt they had no choice but to find intent, which could violate the defendant's right to have the jury determine intent based on all the evidence presented.\n\nOption B says that the Court will likely reverse because the wording in effect caused the defendant to be a witness against himself by having him intend everything that he did. This seems to be touching on the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. If the jury instruction effectively made the defendant admit to having the intent to murder, that might be seen as forcing him to testify against himself, which is unconstitutional. However, I'm not sure if that's the primary issue here. The defendant did admit to killing her, but the question is about his intent\u2014whether he intended to murder her or not. So, I'm not sure if this option accurately captures the issue.\n\nOption C says that the Court won't reverse because the defendant could raise an argument to rebut the permissible inference created by the jury instruction. This suggests that the instruction created a permissible inference that the defendant intended the consequences of his acts, but he could offer evidence to counter that inference. In other words, the presumption is rebuttable. If that's the case, and the defendant was able to present evidence to show that he didn't have the intent to murder due to his personality disorder and drinking, then perhaps the conviction should stand. However, the issue seems to be that the jury was instructed that the law \"presumes\" intent, but weren't told that they could consider evidence to rebut that presumption. If the jury thought they had to find intent based on the presumption and couldn't consider the defendant's arguments otherwise, that could be a problem.\n\nOption D says that the Court won't reverse because the instruction was only a presumption that the jury did not have to consider in their deliberations. This seems confusing. If it's a presumption, then it's something that the jury is supposed to consider unless there's evidence to the contrary. So, if the jury was instructed to presume intent based on the defendant's actions, but they were not told that they could consider evidence to rebut that presumption, that might be an issue. Saying that the jury didn't have to consider the presumption doesn't make much sense because presumptions are meant to be considered unless rebutted.\n\nGiven these options, I think Option A is the most accurate. The problem seems to be that the jury instruction was phrased in a way that it appeared mandatory\u2014that they had to find intent based on the presumption\u2014and didn't allow them to consider other evidence or arguments about the defendant's state of mind. This could have effectively taken the fact-finding role away from the jury, which is a fundamental right in criminal trials.\n\nOption B seems a bit of a stretch because the issue isn't directly about the defendant testifying against himself, but rather about how the jury was instructed to find intent.\n\nOption C suggests that the Court won't reverse because the defendant could rebut the presumption, but if the jury wasn't properly instructed that they could do so, that's still a problem.\n\nOption D doesn't make much sense because presumptions are meant to be considered by the jury, not ignored.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is A: Yes, because the wording of the instruction could have been viewed by jurors as a mandatory direction to find that there was intent to murder.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should think about some related legal principles. In criminal law, the prosecution must prove intent beyond a reasonable doubt. Any instruction that shifts that burden to the defendant or that doesn't allow the jury to properly consider all evidence related to intent could be problematic.\n\nThere's a famous case called Sandstrom v. Montana (1979), where the Supreme Court held that a jury instruction presuming intent violated the defendant's due process rights because it suggested that the jury didn't need to find intent beyond a reasonable doubt. The instruction in that case said, \"the law presumes that a person intends the natural and probable consequences of his voluntary acts.\" The Court found that this instruction relieved the prosecution of its burden to prove intent and could have led the jury to convict without finding intent beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nSimilarly, in another case, Francis v. Franklin (1985), the Court addressed an instruction that allowed the jury to infer malice aforethought from the use of a deadly weapon in a way that was \"manifestly dangerous to human life.\" The Court held that this instruction permitted the jury to find malice based solely on the use of a deadly weapon, without considering the defendant's state of mind, which violated the defendant's due process rights.\n\nGiven these precedents, it seems likely that the Supreme Court would find the instruction in this case problematic if it had the effect of telling the jury that they must find intent based on the presumption, without allowing them to consider evidence to the contrary.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, I think Option A is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
