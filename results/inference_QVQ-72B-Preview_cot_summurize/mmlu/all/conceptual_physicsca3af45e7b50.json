                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Radioactivity has been around on Earth since the...\" and there are four options:\n\nA. Middle of the 1900s\n\nB. Industrial Revolution\n\nC. Advent of medical technology\n\nD. Earth formed\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that radioactivity is a natural phenomenon where certain elements emit particles and energy as their atoms spontaneously decay. So, it's not something that humans created; it's been a part of the natural world.\n\nOption A says the middle of the 1900s. That was around the 1950s and 1960s. But I don't think radioactivity started that recently. Nuclear technology and atomic bombs were developed around that time, but radioactivity itself was already present long before that.\n\nOption B is the Industrial Revolution. That was from the late 18th to the mid-19th century. Again, the Industrial Revolution saw the development of many technologies, but radioactivity was already present in the Earth's crust and in the universe at large before humans started industrializing.\n\nOption C is the advent of medical technology. While medical technology has certainly harnessed radioactivity for things like X-rays and radioactive tracers in diagnostics and treatment, radioactivity was around long before humans started using it for medical purposes.\n\nOption D says the Earth formed. That seems plausible. I recall that radioactive elements like uranium and thorium are found in the Earth's crust, and these elements have been here since the planet formed billions of years ago. In fact, the process of radioactive decay is used to date ancient rocks and determine the age of the Earth.\n\nLet me double-check this. If radioactivity started when the Earth formed, then it has been a part of the planet from the very beginning. The other options suggest more recent origins, which I don't think is accurate because radioactivity is a fundamental property of certain elements, and those elements have been present since the formation of the planet.\n\nI should also consider if there's any possibility that radioactivity could have started after the Earth formed, perhaps due to some external factors. But no, I don't think that's the case. Radioactive elements are created through stellar nucleosynthesis in stars and are present in the material from which planets form.\n\nMoreover, some radioactive isotopes are produced continuously in the Earth's atmosphere through cosmic ray interactions, like carbon-14, which is used in radiocarbon dating. But even that process has been ongoing since the Earth developed an atmosphere.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems that radioactivity has been around on Earth since the planet formed. Therefore, the correct answer should be option D: Earth formed.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll think about whether there's any chance that radioactivity could have been introduced to Earth after its formation. For example, through meteorites or other celestial bodies impacting the Earth. While it's true that meteorites can contain radioactive materials, that wouldn't change the fact that radioactivity was already present on Earth from the start.\n\nAdditionally, human activities like nuclear testing and nuclear power plants have increased the levels of certain radioactive isotopes in the environment, but again, that doesn't change the fundamental presence of radioactivity since the Earth's formation.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
