                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Spark Co. selling cordless phones. Let's see what it's asking. They buy each phone for $125 and sell them for $200. There's a sales commission of $25 per phone sold, and fixed monthly costs are $3000. They want a profit of 10% of sales. I need to find out how many units they have to sell to achieve that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the costs and revenues here. The revenue per phone is $200. The cost per phone is $125, and there's a commission of $25 per phone sold. So, the variable cost per unit is $125 (cost) + $25 (commission) = $150.\n\nThen, the profit per unit is revenue minus variable costs: $200 - $150 = $50 per phone.\n\nNow, there are fixed costs of $3000. So, total profit needed is $3000 plus the desired profit, but wait, they want a profit of 10% of sales. I need to find out what 10% of total sales is and then add the fixed costs to find the total profit needed.\n\nLet me denote the number of units sold as 'x'. Total sales would be $200 * x.\n\n10% of total sales is 0.10 * (200x) = 20x.\n\nSo, they want a profit of $20x.\n\nBut total profit is (profit per unit * x) - fixed costs = ($50x) - $3000.\n\nThis total profit should equal the desired profit of $20x.\n\nSo, set up the equation:\n\n$50x - $3000 = $20x\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n$50x - $20x = $3000\n\n$30x = $3000\n\nx = $3000 / $30\n\nx = 100\n\nSo, they need to sell 100 units to achieve a profit of 10% of sales.\n\nWait, but let's double-check this. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, total revenue is $200x.\n\nTotal costs are variable costs plus fixed costs: ($150x) + $3000.\n\nProfit is total revenue minus total costs: $200x - ($150x + $3000) = $50x - $3000.\n\nThey want profit to be 10% of sales, which is 0.10 * $200x = $20x.\n\nSo, set up the equation:\n\n$50x - $3000 = $20x\n\n$50x - $20x = $3000\n\n$30x = $3000\n\nx = 100\n\nSame answer.\n\nBut looking back at the options, 100 is one of them, but are there other considerations I might have missed?\n\nLet me think about it differently. Maybe calculate the contribution margin and break-even point.\n\nContribution margin per unit is $50, as calculated earlier.\n\nFixed costs are $3000.\n\nIf they want profit to be 10% of sales, that's $20x.\n\nSo, total contribution needed is fixed costs plus desired profit: $3000 + $20x.\n\nThen, contribution per unit times units equals total contribution needed:\n\n$50x = $3000 + $20x\n\n$50x - $20x = $3000\n\n$30x = $3000\n\nx = 100\n\nSame equation again. Seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, think about it in terms of profit-volume ratio or something, but that might be overcomplicating.\n\nWait, another way: express profit as a percentage of sales.\n\nDesired profit is 10% of sales, which is $20x.\n\nTotal profit is $50x - $3000.\n\nSet them equal:\n\n$50x - $3000 = $20x\n\n$30x = $3000\n\nx = 100\n\nSame as before.\n\nI think I've confirmed it multiple ways and getting the same answer each time, so I'm fairly confident with this.\n\nSo, the answer should be 100 units.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 600\n\nB. 400\n\nC. 200\n\nD. 100\n\nSo, D. 100 is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
