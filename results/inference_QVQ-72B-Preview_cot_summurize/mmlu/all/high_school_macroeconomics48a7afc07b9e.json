                    "text": "So I have this question about GDP. The equation is GDP equals C plus I plus G plus X, and it's asking what X stands for. The options are exports, expenditures, exports minus imports, or imports minus exports. Hmm, I need to recall how GDP is calculated.\n\nI remember that GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced within a country in a certain period. The formula breaks down into components: consumption (C), investment (I), government spending (G), and then X, which is related to exports and imports.\n\nLet me think about this. Exports are when we sell goods and services to other countries, and imports are when we buy goods and services from other countries. So, in the context of GDP, exports add to the total production because they're goods and services produced domestically but sold abroad. On the other hand, imports are subtracted because they represent domestic demand for foreign products, which doesn't count towards domestic production.\n\nWait, but the options include both exports and imports. Option A is just exports, which seems too simplistic because I think X should account for both exports and imports.\n\nOption B is expenditures. That doesn't seem right because expenditures would be more related to consumption, which is already included in C. Plus, expenditures could refer to various things, not specifically related to trade.\n\nOption C is exports minus imports. That sounds familiar. I think this is called net exports. So, exports minus imports equal net exports, which is the value that X represents in the GDP formula.\n\nOption D is imports minus exports. That would be the opposite, which is net imports. But I don't think GDP calculation uses net imports; it's usually net exports.\n\nLet me double-check. The standard formula for GDP is indeed GDP = C + I + G + (X - M), where X is exports and M is imports. So, X represents exports minus imports, which is net exports.\n\nSo, according to this, X is exports minus imports, which is option C.\n\nWait a minute, but one of the options is \"exports,\" which is just X, but without considering imports. That can be confusing. But in the standard GDP formula, X is net exports, not just exports.\n\nI think the answer should be C: exports minus imports.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider what each component represents:\n\n- C: Consumption by households and non-profit organizations.\n\n- I: Investment by businesses in capital goods, inventory, and residential housing.\n\n- G: Government spending on goods and services.\n\n- X: Net exports, which is exports minus imports.\n\nSo, adding net exports to the total makes sense because exports contribute to domestic production, while imports subtract from it since they are produced abroad.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C: exports minus imports.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
