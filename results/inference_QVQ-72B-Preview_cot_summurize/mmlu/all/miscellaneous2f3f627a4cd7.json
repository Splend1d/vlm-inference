                    "text": "So I have this question: \"How many $100 bills does it take to equal one million dollars?\" And there are options A. one thousand, B. five thousand, C. ten thousand, and D. one hundred thousand. Hmm, I need to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on simple math problems like this, but let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that one million dollars is $1,000,000. Right? And each $100 bill is, well, $100. So, if I divide the total amount by the value of each bill, I should get the number of bills needed. That is, $1,000,000 divided by $100.\n\nLet me do that division: 1,000,000 \u00f7 100. Hmm, 1,000,000 divided by 100. Well, 100 times 10,000 is 1,000,000. Wait, no, 100 times 10,000 is actually 1,000,000. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo, 1,000,000 \u00f7 100 = 10,000.\n\nThat means ten thousand $100 bills would make one million dollars.\n\nLet me double-check that. If I have ten thousand $100 bills, that's 10,000 multiplied by $100. So, 10,000 \u00d7 $100 = $1,000,000. Yes, that adds up.\n\nI think the answer is C. ten thousand.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any other way to look at this. Maybe thinking in terms of thousands. One million is 1,000 thousands, right? And each $100 bill is one hundred dollars, which is one thousand divided by ten. But that might be complicating things too much.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about how many hundreds are in a million. Like, how many hundreds make a thousand, and then multiply by a thousand. Let's see:\n\nFirst, how many hundreds make a thousand? Well, $1,000 divided by $100 is 10. So, ten $100 bills make $1,000.\n\nNow, since one million is a thousand thousands, maybe I can multiply 10 by a thousand. So, 10 \u00d7 1,000 = 10,000. Again, I get ten thousand $100 bills to make $1,000,000.\n\nThis seems consistent. Both methods point to the same answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's a different approach, maybe using exponents. $100 is 10^2, and $1,000,000 is 10^6. So, if I set up the equation: 100 \u00d7 n = 1,000,000, where n is the number of $100 bills.\n\nSolving for n: n = 1,000,000 \u00f7 100 = 10,000.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. It's reassuring that different methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption A is one thousand. If one thousand $100 bills were equal to $100,000 (since 1,000 \u00d7 $100 = $100,000), which is less than $1,000,000.\n\nOption B is five thousand. Five thousand $100 bills would be $500,000 (5,000 \u00d7 $100 = $500,000), which is still less than $1,000,000.\n\nOption D is one hundred thousand. One hundred thousand $100 bills would be $10,000,000 (100,000 \u00d7 $100 = $10,000,000), which is more than $1,000,000.\n\nSo, among the given options, only C. ten thousand correctly equals $1,000,000 when multiplied by $100.\n\nI should also consider if there's any trick to this question. Is there any way that the question might be trying to mislead me?\n\nFor example, maybe thinking in terms of weight or size instead of value. But no, the question is straightforward: it's about the number of $100 bills needed to make up one million dollars in value.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the bills are consecutive or not, but that doesn't affect the total value.\n\nAlso, perhaps thinking about whether the bills are new or old, but that doesn't matter for the value either.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The question is simple, and the answer is straightforward.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. ten thousand.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
