                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"As of 2013, share of people in India who think political parties are corrupt is...\" and then there are four options: A. 26%, B. 46%, C. 66%, D. 86%. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I remember that corruption can be a big issue in many countries, including India. Political parties sometimes face allegations of corruption, which can affect people's perceptions. But I don't have any specific data from 2013 off the top of my head. Maybe I should think about general trends or look for some surveys from that time.\n\nI recall that Transparency International often does surveys on corruption perceptions, and maybe they have some data from 2013 for India. Alternatively, perhaps there are polls by other organizations that asked Indians about their views on political party corruption around that time.\n\nLet me try to recall if there were any significant events in India in 2013 related to corruption in political parties. I think there were several high-profile corruption scandals in India in the early 2010s, which might have influenced people's perceptions. Maybe that could give me a clue about the percentage.\n\nBut guessing based on events isn't the best approach. I should try to find actual survey data from 2013. Perhaps I can search for reports or statistics from that year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at more recent data and see if there's been any change, but the question specifies 2013, so I need to find information from around that time.\n\nWait a minute, I think I've heard of a global corruption barometer that Transparency International publishes. Maybe I can check that for 2013 data on India.\n\nLet me assume that such a report exists and see what it says. Suppose that in 2013, Transparency International surveyed people in India about their perceptions of corruption in political parties.\n\nIf I recall correctly, their surveys usually ask questions like, \"Do you think political parties are influenced by corruption?\" and offer options like \"very corrupt,\" \"somewhat corrupt,\" or \"not corrupt.\"\n\nBut the question here is more specific; it's about the share of people who think political parties are corrupt, without specifying the degree. So, it might be a yes-or-no type of question, or perhaps combining several categories.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's referring to the percentage of people who consider political parties to be corrupt at all, regardless of the extent.\n\nGiven that, I need to find the percentage of people in India who thought political parties were corrupt in 2013.\n\nLet me consider that maybe 50% of people thought political parties were corrupt, but that's just a random guess. To be more precise, perhaps I should consider that in countries where corruption is perceived to be high, the percentage might be higher.\n\nBut again, that's not helping me pin down the exact number. Maybe I should look at the options again: 26%, 46%, 66%, 86%. Which one seems plausible?\n\nIf I think about it, 26% seems quite low for a perception of corruption in political parties, especially given the scandals that may have occurred around that time. 86% seems really high, almost everyone thinking political parties are corrupt, which might also be an overestimation.\n\n46% and 66% seem more middle-of-the-road. Maybe around half of the people thought political parties were corrupt. But I need a more accurate figure.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that in 2013, there was a wave of anti-corruption sentiment in India, with movements led by figures like Anna Hazare. That might suggest that public perception of corruption was quite high at that time.\n\nConsidering that, maybe the percentage was towards the higher side, say around 66% or 86%. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at more recent data and see if there's been any trend. For example, if more recent surveys show a certain percentage, perhaps I can infer that in 2013, it was similar or different based on events since then.\n\nBut the question is specifically about 2013, so relying on more recent data might not be accurate.\n\nAnother approach could be to look at global comparisons. Maybe in 2013, India was part of a survey that included multiple countries, and I can find the percentage there.\n\nAssuming that's the case, perhaps I can recall that in 2013, a certain percentage of Indians thought political parties were corrupt.\n\nWait, I think I've heard of a survey where around two-thirds of Indians thought political parties were corrupt in 2013. That would point towards option C, 66%.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should consider that in 2013, due to various scandals, the perception was even higher, like 86%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the figure was lower, around 46%, indicating that just under half of the population thought political parties were corrupt.\n\n26% seems too low, so I'll probably eliminate that option.\n\nTo make an educated guess, I'll consider that in 2013, around 66% of Indians thought political parties were corrupt.\n\nSo, my answer would be C. 66%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
