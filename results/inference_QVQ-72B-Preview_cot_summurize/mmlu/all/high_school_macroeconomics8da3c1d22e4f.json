                    "text": "So I have this question about real income. It says that the consumer price index (CPI) increases by 2 percent and my nominal income increases by 8 percent. I need to find out by how much my real income has changed, approximately.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what nominal income and real income are. Nominal income is my income in current dollars, like the amount I see on my paycheck before adjusting for inflation. Real income, on the other hand, is my income adjusted for inflation, which reflects what I can actually buy with that money.\n\nThe consumer price index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. So, when the CPI increases by 2 percent, it means that the overall price level of goods and services has increased by 2 percent.\n\nNow, to find the percentage change in real income, I need to consider both the change in nominal income and the change in the CPI.\n\nI recall that the formula to calculate the percentage change in real income is approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage change in real income} \\approx \\text{percentage change in nominal income} - \\text{percentage change in CPI}\n\\]\n\nSo, plugging in the given numbers:\n\n\\[\n8\\% - 2\\% = 6\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, my real income has increased by approximately 6 percent.\n\nWait a minute, is it that straightforward? Let's double-check.\n\nI remember that real income can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{real income} = \\frac{\\text{nominal income}}{\\text{CPI}}\n\\]\n\nBut since CPI is an index, it's usually expressed as a percentage of a base year. For simplicity, often CPI is expressed in terms of percentage changes.\n\nGiven that, the percentage change in real income can be approximated by the difference between the percentage change in nominal income and the percentage change in CPI.\n\nSo, if nominal income increases by 8% and CPI increases by 2%, the real income increases by 8% - 2% = 6%.\n\nThat seems correct, but maybe I should consider the exact formula to confirm.\n\nLet's assume an initial CPI value of 100 and an initial nominal income of $100 for simplicity.\n\nAfter the changes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{new CPI} = 100 + (2\\% \\times 100) = 102\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{new nominal income} = 100 + (8\\% \\times 100) = 108\n\\]\n\nNow, initial real income:\n\n\\[\n\\text{initial real income} = \\frac{100}{100} = $1.00\n\\]\n\nNew real income:\n\n\\[\n\\text{new real income} = \\frac{108}{102} \\approx $1.0588\n\\]\n\nSo, the percentage change in real income is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1.0588 - 1.00}{1.00} \\times 100\\% \\approx 5.88\\%\n\\]\n\nHmm, earlier I used the approximation and got 6%, and now with exact calculations, I get approximately 5.88%. So, the approximation is close but not exactly 6%.\n\nMaybe the options are not precise, and they're looking for the closest answer. In that case, option C says increased by 6 percent, which is the closest to 5.88%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider more decimal places in my calculations.\n\nLet's try recalculating with more precision.\n\nInitial real income:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{100}{100} = 1.000\n\\]\n\nNew real income:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{108}{102} \\approx 1.058823529\n\\]\n\nPercentage change:\n\n\\[\n(1.058823529 - 1.000000000) / 1.000000000 \\times 100\\% \\approx 5.8823529\\%\n\\]\n\nStill approximately 5.88%, which rounds to 6%.\n\nSo, the closest answer is C. increased by 6 percent.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"approximately,\" so even if it's a bit less than 6%, C is still the best choice.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. increased by 6 percent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
