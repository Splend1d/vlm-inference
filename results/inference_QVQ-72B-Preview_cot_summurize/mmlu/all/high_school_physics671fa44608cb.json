                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this problem about a double-slit interference experiment. The question is asking which change would increase the widths of the fringes in the interference pattern that shows up on the screen. The options are:\n\nA. Use light of a shorter wavelength.\n\nB. Move the screen closer to the slits.\n\nC. Move the slits closer together.\n\nD. Use light with a lower wave speed.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall how fringe width is determined in a double-slit experiment. I remember that in interference patterns, the fringe width (the distance between adjacent bright or dark fringes) is related to the wavelength of the light, the distance between the slits, and the distance from the slits to the screen.\n\nLet me try to recall the formula for fringe width. I think it's something like \u03b4 = (\u03bb * D) / d, where:\n\n- \u03b4 is the fringe width,\n\n- \u03bb is the wavelength of the light,\n\n- D is the distance from the slits to the screen,\n\n- d is the distance between the slits.\n\nYes, that sounds familiar. So, if I want to increase the fringe width, I need to see how each of these variables affects \u03b4.\n\nOption A suggests using light of a shorter wavelength. If \u03bb decreases, and \u03b4 is proportional to \u03bb, then decreasing \u03bb should decrease \u03b4, right? So, that would make the fringes narrower, not wider. So, option A is probably not the correct choice.\n\nOption B says to move the screen closer to the slits. That means decreasing D. Since \u03b4 is proportional to D, decreasing D would decrease \u03b4, making the fringes narrower again. So, this doesn't help in increasing the fringe width.\n\nOption C proposes moving the slits closer together, which means decreasing d. If \u03b4 is inversely proportional to d, then decreasing d should increase \u03b4, making the fringes wider. This seems like a possible answer.\n\nOption D mentions using light with a lower wave speed. Hmm, I know that wave speed in a medium is related to the medium's properties, like density and elasticity. But in vacuum, the speed of light is constant. Anyway, I need to think about how wave speed affects wavelength. There's a relationship between frequency, wavelength, and speed: v = f * \u03bb. If the speed decreases and the frequency stays the same, then \u03bb decreases. But in this context, I'm not sure if changing the wave speed directly affects the fringe width in the same way as changing the wavelength.\n\nWait a minute, in the standard double-slit experiment, we usually assume that the light is in vacuum or air, where the speed is effectively the speed of light in vacuum. If I use a medium with a different refractive index, the speed of light changes. But does that affect the fringe width?\n\nLet me think about Young's double-slit experiment. If I place a medium between the slits and the screen, the wavelength of light in that medium changes because \u03bbmedium = \u03bbvacuum / n, where n is the refractive index of the medium. So, if n increases, \u03bb decreases. But in option D, it just says to use light with a lower wave speed, which could imply using a medium with a higher refractive index.\n\nBut wait, the speed of light in a medium is v = c / n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum and n is the refractive index. So, if I use a medium with a higher refractive index, the speed decreases, but the wavelength also decreases proportionally. So, going back to the fringe width formula \u03b4 = (\u03bb * D) / d, if \u03bb decreases, \u03b4 decreases, which is the opposite of what I want.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Perhaps the distance D changes if I put a medium in between. No, the distance D is just the distance from the slits to the screen, which shouldn't change just by introducing a medium.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fringe width formula adjusts for the refractive index. I think the standard formula assumes that D is measured in the medium if the screen is in the medium. But this is getting complicated, and I'm not sure if that's the right direction.\n\nMaybe I should consider option D as implying a change in wavelength indirectly through the wave speed. If the wave speed decreases, and assuming frequency remains constant, then wavelength decreases, which would decrease \u03b4, making the fringes narrower. So, similar to option A.\n\nWait, but in the context of the experiment, if I use light in a medium with a higher refractive index, does that affect the frequency? No, frequency is usually considered constant; only the wavelength changes.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\n- A: shorter wavelength \u2192 smaller \u03b4\n\n- B: closer screen \u2192 smaller \u03b4\n\n- C: closer slits \u2192 larger \u03b4\n\n- D: lower wave speed \u2192 shorter wavelength \u2192 smaller \u03b4\n\nTherefore, the only option that increases the fringe width is C: moving the slits closer together.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
