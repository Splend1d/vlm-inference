                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"What is the largest animal ever to live on Earth?\" and the options are A. blue whale, B. giant squid, C. woolly mammoth, and D. Tyrannosaurus. Hmm, okay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I need to determine which of these animals is the largest ever to have lived on Earth. That sounds pretty straightforward, but I should consider a few things like their size, weight, and overall mass. Maybe even look into some specific measurements if I can recall any.\n\nStarting with option A, the blue whale. I remember that whales are massive creatures, and the blue whale is particularly famous for its size. In fact, I think it's commonly cited as the largest animal to have ever lived. But just to be sure, maybe I should recall some specific numbers. I believe blue whales can grow up to about 100 feet in length and weigh around 200 tons or more. That's pretty huge, but let's see how that compares to the other options.\n\nNext, option B, the giant squid. Squids are certainly large, and the giant squid is known for being particularly big, especially in terms of length due to their long tentacles. I think they can grow up to about 40 to 50 feet in length. However, in terms of overall mass and weight, I don't think they come close to the blue whale. Maybe their length is impressive, but weight-wise, it's probably not comparable.\n\nMoving on to option C, the woolly mammoth. These are prehistoric relatives of elephants, known for their size and the furry coats that helped them adapt to cold climates. Elephants are already large animals, and mammoths were similarly sized, if not slightly larger in some species. I think they could reach heights of about 13 feet at the shoulder and weigh up to about 12 tons. That's considerably smaller than the blue whale in terms of weight and overall size.\n\nLastly, option D, Tyrannosaurus. This is a dinosaur, specifically a theropod known for its large size and predatory habits. Dinosaurs can be pretty big, and Tyrannosaurus is one of the larger ones. I recall that they could grow up to about 40 feet in length and weigh up to about 7 tons. Again, compared to the blue whale, this seems much smaller.\n\nSo, based on the measurements I can recall, the blue whale seems to be the largest among these options by a significant margin, whether considering length or weight. The giant squid might be long, but its weight isn't comparable, and the woolly mammoth and Tyrannosaurus, while large, don't reach the same sizes as the blue whale.\n\nJust to make sure I'm not missing anything, maybe I should think about whether there are any other animals, either extinct or extant, that could potentially be larger than the blue whale. For example, I know that there are other types of whales, like the sperm whale or the fin whale, but I believe the blue whale is still the largest among them. As for dinosaurs, while some species like the Argentinosaurus or Sauroposeidon were massive, I think they might have been larger in length but not necessarily in weight compared to the blue whale. However, since those aren't options here, I think it's safe to stick with the blue whale as the largest animal ever to live on Earth from the given choices.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the blue whale's size is not just about length or height but about its overall volume and weight, which makes it the largest animal in terms of mass. So, all things considered, I'm confident that the correct answer is A. blue whale.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ blue whale}} \\]"
