Due to allegations of illegal activities in other massage parlors not affiliated with this owner, the city canceled the owner's personal license and revoked the business permits. The only information provided was a general notice from the city declaring a new policy on massage parlors that had to be rapidly instituted for the welfare of the community. She sued the city in federal court, claiming that her business had been taken without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment takings clause. She claimed a lack of procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court granted a motion to dismiss based on her not having a property interest that was affected, including in the license and permits. She appealed the decision. Will the federal Court of Appeals affirm the lower court dismissal of her case?\n\nA. Yes, because there is no right to earning a living under the substantive due process clause.\nB. Yes, because the state interest in protecting the public from illegal activities required the state action that was taken.\nC. No, because once the parlor had opened with all the proper permits, it could not be deprived of its licenses for any reason until they were up for renewal.\nD.

                    "text": "So I've got this case here, and I need to figure out whether the federal Court of Appeals will affirm the lower court's decision to dismiss the lawsuit. The owner of a massage parlor is suing the state because her license and business permits were canceled, and she's claiming that this amounts to a taking without just compensation under the Fifth Amendment and a violation of procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the background. The state canceled the owner's license and permits due to allegations of illegal activities in other massage parlors that weren't even affiliated with her. Then, the city provided a general notice about a new policy on massage parlors for the welfare of the community. The owner sued, saying her business was taken without just compensation and that she didn't receive due process.\n\nThe lower court dismissed her case, saying she didn't have a property interest that was affected, including her license and permits. Now, she's appealing that decision.\n\nI need to look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because there is no right to earning a living under the substantive due process clause.\n\nB. Yes, because the state interest in protecting the public from illegal activities required the state action that was taken.\n\nC. No, because once the parlor had opened with all the proper permits, it could not be deprived of its licenses for any reason until they were up for renewal.\n\nD. No, because she had a property right in her license and permits, which were taken without any procedural due process.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, regarding the Fifth Amendment takings clause. Generally, the takings clause prohibits the government from taking private property for public use without just compensation. In this case, the owner is arguing that her business was taken without compensation.\n\nBut is the cancellation of a license considered a taking? Licenses are typically regulatory in nature, and courts often view them as subject to revocation if the holder violates the terms or if there's a change in regulation.\n\nMaybe the takings clause isn't the best argument here, especially since the action was taken in response to allegations of illegal activities in similar businesses, which could be seen as a legitimate public interest.\n\nBut perhaps the key issue is whether the owner had a property interest in her license and permits that was protected by due process.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause protects against the deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. To have a property interest, there needs to be a legitimate claim of entitlement to the benefit, like a license, that cannot be denied arbitrarily.\n\nIn this case, the owner had a license and permits to operate her massage parlor. Generally, licenses can be seen as property interests if they're granted based on certain criteria and can't be revoked without cause.\n\nThe state canceled her license and permits based on allegations of illegal activities in other, unaffiliated massage parlors and a new policy for the welfare of the community.\n\nDoes this mean her property interest was taken without due process? It seems like the state didn't give her a chance to be heard before revoking her license, assuming that's what happened.\n\nOption D suggests that she had a property right in her license and permits and that taking them without procedural due process is a violation.\n\nOption C says that once the parlor opened with proper permits, it couldn't be deprived of its licenses for any reason until renewal.\n\nOption B says that the state's interest in protecting the public from illegal activities justifies the action.\n\nOption A says there's no right to earn a living under substantive due process.\n\nFirst, let's consider option A. Substantive due process generally protects fundamental rights not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. The right to earn a living might be seen as a liberty interest, but it's not absolute and can be regulated by the state.\n\nSo, maybe option A is partially correct, but it doesn't directly address the property interest in the license and permits.\n\nOption B argues that the state's interest in protecting the public is sufficient to justify the action. While that's a valid consideration, it doesn't necessarily mean that the state can revoke a license without following due process procedures.\n\nOption C suggests that once a business has opened with proper permits, it can't be deprived of its licenses without cause until renewal. This seems plausible because permits are usually granted for a set period and can't be arbitrarily revoked before that period ends.\n\nOption D states that she had a property right in her license and permits and that taking them without procedural due process is a violation.\n\nGiven that, it seems like options C and D are related but approach the issue differently.\n\nOption C focuses on the permits and suggests that once issued, they can't be revoked without cause before renewal.\n\nOption D frames it as a property right in the license and permits that was taken without due process.\n\nI think option D is more comprehensive because it encompasses both the license and the permits as property interests protected by due process.\n\nOption C seems to focus more narrowly on permits and might not cover the license aspect.\n\nMoreover, the lower court dismissed the case saying she didn't have a property interest affected, including in the license and permits. If the appeals court finds that she did have such a property interest, then the dismissal was incorrect.\n\nTherefore, option D seems like the correct answer: no, the appeals court will not affirm the dismissal because she had a property right in her license and permits that were taken without any procedural due process.\n\nSo, the answer is D."
