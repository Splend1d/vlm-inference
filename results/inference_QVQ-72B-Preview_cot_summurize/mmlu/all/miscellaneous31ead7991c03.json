Hmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that in bowling, a strike is when you knock down all ten pins with one ball. If you get three of those in a row, there must be a special term for it. I think I've heard the term \"turkey\" used in bowling, but I'm not entirely sure what it refers to.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A is yahtzee. I know yahtzee is a dice game where players roll five dice and try to get various combinations. A yahtzee specifically refers to rolling all five dice the same number. So, that's definitely not related to bowling. Maybe someone is trying to confuse me here.\n\nOption B is mulligan. In golf, a mulligan is an extra stroke that's sometimes allowed without penalty, like a do-over. I don't recall mulligans being a thing in bowling. Maybe in some casual games, but not in official terms. So, probably not the right answer.\n\nOption C is turkey. I've heard this term before in bowling, but I need to remember what it means. Let me see, in bowling, a turkey is when a player gets three strikes in a row. Wait, that sounds familiar. Is that the definition? It seems like it might be the case.\n\nOption D is ace. In various sports, like tennis or cricket, an ace refers to a serve that the opponent can't return or a six-hit, respectively. I don't see a direct connection to bowling strikes. Maybe in some contexts, but not generally.\n\nSo, based on this elimination process, it looks like \"turkey\" is the term for three consecutive strikes in bowling. Let me just double-check this to be absolutely sure.\n\nI recall that in bowling, there are terms for sequences of strikes. For example, a perfect game is 12 strikes in a row, which scores 300 points. But that's beside the point here. For three strikes in a row, I think the common term is indeed a turkey.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll try to recall if there's any other term that might refer to three strikes in a row. Hmm, no, nothing comes to mind besides turkey.\n\nAlright, I'm fairly confident now. Three consecutive strikes in bowling are called a turkey.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. turkey}} \\]"
