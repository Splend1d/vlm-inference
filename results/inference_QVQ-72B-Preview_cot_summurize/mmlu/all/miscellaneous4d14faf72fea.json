I remember that phonics is about teaching how letters and sounds correspond in words, right? So, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that students study lists of high-frequency words to increase reading speed and comprehension. Hmm, that sounds more like whole language approach or sight word instruction, like the Dolch words. In traditional phonics, it's more about teaching the relationship between letters and sounds, not just memorizing words.\n\nOption B says that students are taught individual letter sounds first, then letter combination sounds, and then how to put these combinations together to make words. This seems logical. It's like building blocks\u2014start with single sounds, then blend them into syllables or whole words. This seems consistent with phonics instruction.\n\nOption C mentions that students are immersed in written language and encouraged to decode entire words using context clues. This sounds a bit like the whole language approach, where reading is taught through immersion and using context to figure out words, rather than explicitly teaching letter-sound correspondences.\n\nOption D talks about analyzing patterns of organization and syntax to learn common structures. This seems more related to understanding text structure or grammar, not directly to phonics, which is more about the sound-symbol correspondence in words.\n\nSo, based on this, option B seems to be the best description of traditional phonics instruction. It starts with letter sounds and builds up to combining sounds to make words, which is the core of phonics teaching.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure. Let me think about it again. In traditional phonics, sometimes called synthetic phonics, instructors teach the sounds of letters and then how to blend those sounds to make words. So, yes, that matches option B.\n\nOption A is more about sight words, which is a different approach. Option C is similar to whole language, which emphasizes reading real texts and using context to understand words, rather than breaking words down into sounds.\n\nOption D seems to be more about comprehension and text analysis, which is important in reading but not specifically phonics instruction.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. Students are taught individual letter sounds first, followed by letter combination sounds and the rules of putting these combinations together to make words.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
