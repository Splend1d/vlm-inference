                    "text": "Let's see. So, there are these dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico near where the Mississippi River meets the ocean. They happen every year, and they're caused by algae growing really fast\u2014algal blooms\u2014and then decaying, which uses up oxygen in the water, creating dead zones where nothing can live. I need to figure out what's causing these algal blooms in the first place.\n\nOption A says that a decrease in light levels as days get shorter after the summer solstice triggers the algal blooms. Hmm, but I thought algae need light to grow through photosynthesis. So if light decreases, wouldn't that slow down algae growth rather than speed it up? Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nOption B mentions increased predation by marine larvae and other zooplankton during the summer months. If predators are eating more algae, wouldn't that reduce the algal population instead of causing a bloom? It seems counterintuitive that increased predation would lead to more algae. Maybe there's a different explanation.\n\nOption C talks about a summer influx of nutrients, specifically nitrogen and phosphorus from chemical fertilizers. I've heard that fertilizers can run off into rivers and eventually into the ocean, bringing a lot of nutrients that algae love. So, if there's a surge of these nutrients in the summer, that could fuel a massive algae growth spurt. That sounds plausible.\n\nOption D suggests decreased competition from other marine phytoplankton during the summer months. If competition decreases, maybe algae can thrive more easily. But I'm not sure why competition would decrease in the summer specifically. Maybe certain species die off in hotter temperatures, but I don't know enough about that.\n\nLet me think this through. Algal blooms are typically driven by an abundance of nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus. These nutrients can come from various sources, including agricultural runoff, which often contains fertilizers. The Mississippi River drains a large area of farmland in the Midwest, so during the growing season, when farmers are using fertilizers, there's probably more runoff into the river and then into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nSo, during the summer, when rainfall might be higher and the land is being irrigated, there could be a lot of nutrient-rich water flowing into the Gulf. That would provide the perfect conditions for algae to proliferate.\n\nNow, going back to option A, if light decreases after the summer solstice, that might actually slow down algae growth, not accelerate it. So, that seems contradictory. Maybe the question is a bit tricky in its wording.\n\nOption B, increased predation by zooplankton: if zooplankton are eating more algae, that should reduce the algae population, right? Unless the zooplankton are also contributing to the nutrient cycle in some way that promotes algae growth, but I don't think that's the case.\n\nOption D, decreased competition from other phytoplankton: this could be a factor, but I think it's secondary to the availability of nutrients. Even if competition decreases, without a sufficient nutrient supply, algae might not bloom.\n\nGiven this reasoning, option C seems the most straightforward answer. The influx of nutrients from fertilizers during the summer leads to algal blooms, which then decay and create dead zones.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any evidence or research that supports this connection.\n\nI recall that the Gulf of Mexico dead zone is well-documented, and it's been linked to nutrient pollution from the Mississippi River basin. Farmers in the Midwest use a lot of fertilizers, which can run off into streams and rivers, especially during heavy rains or when the soil is saturated.\n\nThis runoff carries high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, which are essential for plant growth. When these nutrients reach the Gulf, they stimulate the growth of phytoplankton, leading to algal blooms.\n\nAs the algae die, they sink and are decomposed by bacteria, which consume oxygen in the process. This oxygen depletion creates areas where oxygen levels are too low to support most marine life, hence the term \"dead zones.\"\n\nSo, based on this background information, it seems clear that the primary trigger for these algal blooms is the summer influx of nutrients from fertilizer runoff.\n\nLet me see if there's any other factor that could be at play here. For example, water temperature could affect algae growth. Warmer water can sometimes promote algae growth, but in the case of the Gulf of Mexico, the primary driver is thought to be nutrient loading.\n\nAlso, changes in salinity or other chemical factors could influence algae populations, but again, the main issue here is the excess nutrients leading to eutrophication and algal blooms.\n\nAnother point to consider is the role of natural events, like upwelling, which can bring nutrient-rich waters to the surface, promoting algae growth. However, in the Gulf of Mexico, the primary source of nutrients is the Mississippi River runoff.\n\nFurthermore, human activities, such as agricultural practices and wastewater treatment, can contribute to nutrient loads in the river. Efforts to reduce these loads have been part of strategies to mitigate the size and impact of the dead zone.\n\nIn summary, among the given options, C is the most likely factor triggering the algal blooms and associated dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico. The summer influx of nutrients from fertilizers provides the necessary conditions for algae to flourish, leading to oxygen depletion and the formation of dead zones.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
