We then discoursed of the circulation of the blood, the valves in the veins, the venae lactae, the lymphatic vessels, the Copernican hypothesis, the nature of comets and new stars, the satellites of Jupiter, the oval shape (as it then appeared) of Saturn, the spots in the sun, and its turning on its own axis, the inequalities and selenography of the moon, the several phases of Venus and Mercury, the improvement of telescopes, and grinding of glasses for that purpose, the weight of air, the possibility, or impossibility of vacuities, and nature's abhorrence thereof, the Torricellian experiment in quicksilver, the descent of heavy bodies, and the degrees of acceleration therein; and divers other things of like nature. Some of which were then but new discoveries, and others not so generally known and embraced, as now they are. \u2026\nWe barred all discourses of divinity, of state affairs, and of news, other than what concerned our business of Philosophy. These meetings we removed soon after to the Bull Head in Cheapside, and in term-time to Gresham College, where we met weekly at Mr. Foster's lecture (then Astronomy Professor there), and, after the lecture ended, repaired, sometimes to Mr. Foster's lodgings, sometimes to some other place not far distant, where we continued such enquiries, and our numbers increased.\nDr. John Wallis, Account of Some Passages of his Life, 1700\nFrom the passage, one may infer that the main interest of Wallis's group was\n\nA. undermining of the traditional worldview\nB. creating of a secular science to challenge the Church\nC. ascertaining the state of the New Philosophy in England and abroad\nD. the regulation of new knowledge so as not to undermine traditional values\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this passage to read and understand. It's from Dr. John Wallis's \"Account of Some Passages of his Life\" from 1700. He's talking about a group he was part of around 1645 in London, where they met weekly to discuss various topics related to natural philosophy and experimental philosophy. There are a bunch of terms here that I need to unpack to really get what's going on.\n\nFirst off, natural philosophy sounds a lot like what we'd call natural science today. It was about observing and understanding the natural world. Experimental philosophy, from the context, seems to be about conducting experiments to test ideas and theories, which aligns with the scientific method.\n\nWallis mentions that they met weekly in London on a certain day to discuss these topics. They had agreements in place to focus on these subjects and exclude others, like theology and state affairs. That suggests they wanted to keep their discussions purely on scientific and philosophical topics without getting into religious or political debates.\n\nHe lists a variety of subjects they discussed: physics, anatomy, geometry, astronomy, navigation, statics, magnetics, chemics, mechanics, and natural experiments. These cover a broad range of scientific disciplines, indicating that the group was interested in many different aspects of the natural world.\n\nWallis also mentions specific topics within these fields, like the circulation of the blood, the valves in veins, the venae lactae (which I believe are the lacteal vessels in the intestines), the lymphatic vessels, the Copernican hypothesis (that the Earth revolves around the Sun), the nature of comets and new stars, the satellites of Jupiter, the oval shape of Saturn, the spots on the Sun and its rotation on its axis, the inequalities and selenography of the Moon (which probably refers to the mapping of the Moon's surface), the several phases of Venus and Mercury, the improvement of telescopes and glass grinding for that purpose, the weight of air, the possibility or impossibility of vacuities (vacuums), nature's abhorrence of a vacuum (an old idea), the Torricellian experiment with mercury (likely referring to Torricelli's barometer experiment), the descent of heavy bodies and the degrees of acceleration (relating to gravity and motion), and other similar topics.\n\nThese specific topics suggest that the group was at the cutting edge of scientific thought at the time, discussing recent discoveries and theories that were shaping the scientific revolution.\n\nNow, the question is asking what one can infer about the main interest of Wallis's group. The options are:\n\nA. Undermining of the traditional worldview\n\nB. Creating of a secular science to challenge the Church\n\nC. Ascertaining the state of the New Philosophy in England and abroad\n\nD. The regulation of new knowledge so as not to undermine traditional values\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Undermining of the traditional worldview: While the topics they discussed, like the Copernican hypothesis and the nature of comets, were indeed challenging traditional views, the passage doesn't explicitly suggest that their goal was to undermine the traditional worldview. They were more about discussing new ideas and discoveries.\n\nB. Creating of a secular science to challenge the Church: Again, their discussions included many topics that were revolutionary at the time and might have challenged Church doctrines, but the passage says they excluded discussions of theology and state affairs. This might indicate they weren't directly aiming to challenge the Church but were focusing on scientific enquiry.\n\nC. Ascertaining the state of the New Philosophy in England and abroad: This seems very plausible. They were discussing the latest findings and theories in natural and experimental philosophy, both from England and elsewhere. Their aim appears to be understanding and advancing knowledge in these fields.\n\nD. The regulation of new knowledge so as not to undermine traditional values: This seems contrary to the spirit of their discussions. They were exploring new ideas, some of which were indeed revolutionary and potentially at odds with traditional values. There's no indication that they were trying to regulate knowledge to preserve traditional values; in fact, their exclusion of theology and state affairs suggests they were trying to keep their discussions focused on science and philosophy without religious or political constraints.\n\nGiven this analysis, option C seems to be the most accurate inference based on the information provided in the passage. They were interested in understanding the current state of new philosophical and scientific ideas, both domestically and internationally.\n\nBut let me double-check. The passage mentions that they discussed \"the state of these studies, as then cultivated at home and abroad.\" That directly supports option C. Additionally, their focus on new discoveries and experimental philosophy suggests they were trying to stay current with the latest developments in the field.\n\nOptions A and B imply a more confrontational or subversive agenda, which isn't clearly supported by the passage. While their discussions may have indirectly challenged traditional views, their primary purpose seems to be the pursuit of knowledge through scientific and philosophical enquiry.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C: ascertaining the state of the New Philosophy in England and abroad.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
