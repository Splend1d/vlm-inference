                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. There are 10 scores in a group, and the largest score is increased by 40 points. I need to figure out what happens to the mean of these scores. The options are:\n\nA. It will remain the same.\n\nB. It will increase by 4 points.\n\nC. It will increase by 10 points.\n\nD. It will increase by 40 points.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what a mean is. The mean is just the average of all the scores, right? So, you add up all the scores and then divide by the number of scores.\n\nLet me denote the original scores as S1, S2, S3, up to S10. The mean of these scores is (S1 + S2 + S3 + ... + S10) / 10.\n\nNow, it says the largest score is increased by 40 points. Let's assume that S10 is the largest score. So, S10 is increased by 40, making it S10 + 40.\n\nThe new set of scores is S1, S2, S3, ..., S9, S10 + 40.\n\nThe new mean will be (S1 + S2 + S3 + ... + S9 + S10 + 40) / 10.\n\nI need to find out how this new mean compares to the original mean.\n\nLet me calculate the difference between the new mean and the original mean.\n\nNew mean = (sum of all original scores + 40) / 10\n\nOriginal mean = sum of all original scores / 10\n\nSo, the difference is:\n\n(New mean) - (Original mean) = (sum + 40)/10 - sum/10 = (sum/10 + 40/10) - sum/10 = 40/10 = 4.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, the mean increases by 4 points.\n\nBut let me double-check this reasoning.\n\nSuppose the original sum of all scores is 'S'. Then, the original mean is S/10.\n\nAfter increasing the largest score by 40, the new sum is S + 40.\n\nThus, the new mean is (S + 40)/10.\n\nThe difference between the new mean and the original mean is:\n\n(S + 40)/10 - S/10 = 40/10 = 4.\n\nSo, the mean increases by 4 points.\n\nWait a minute, but one of the options is that the mean increases by 10 points. Why wouldn't that be the case?\n\nLet me think about it again.\n\nIf only one score is increased by 40, and there are 10 scores in total, the mean increases by 40 divided by 10, which is 4.\n\nSo, the correct choice should be B. It will increase by 4 points.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider an example.\n\nSuppose the original scores are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.\n\nThe mean is (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)/10 = 55/10 = 5.5.\n\nNow, if the largest score, which is 10, is increased by 40, the new score is 50.\n\nThe new set of scores is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 50.\n\nThe new mean is (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+50)/10 = (55 + 40)/10 = 95/10 = 9.5.\n\nThe original mean was 5.5, and the new mean is 9.5.\n\nThe increase is 9.5 - 5.5 = 4, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nLet me try another example to confirm.\n\nSuppose the original scores are all the same, say 10 each.\n\nSo, scores: 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10.\n\nMean is (10*10)/10 = 10.\n\nIf the largest score (which is 10) is increased by 40, new score is 50.\n\nNew set: 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 50.\n\nNew mean is (10*9 + 50)/10 = (90 + 50)/10 = 140/10 = 14.\n\nOriginal mean was 10, new mean is 14.\n\nIncrease is 4.\n\nAgain, consistent with the earlier result.\n\nSeems like the mean increases by 4 points when the largest score is increased by 40 points, given there are 10 scores.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. It will increase by 4 points.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
