                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this problem about reaction rates and how they relate to the concentrations of reactants. The question is asking for the order of the reaction with respect to reactant A. From what I remember, the rate law for a reaction is usually expressed as rate = k[A]^m[B]^n[...], where m and n are the orders with respect to each reactant.\n\nIn this problem, they're keeping the concentrations of all other reactants constant and only changing the concentration of A. When they triple the concentration of A, the reaction rate also triples. They're asking for the exponent of A in the rate law, which would be m in the general rate law equation I mentioned.\n\nSo, if the rate law is rate = k[A]^m, and we triple the concentration of A, the new rate becomes k(3[A])^m = k3^m[A]^m. According to the problem, the rate triples when A triples, so k3^m[A]^m = 3 * k[A]^m.\n\nTo find m, I can set up the equation: 3^m = 3.\n\nNow, I need to solve for m. If 3^m = 3, then m must be 1 because 3^1 = 3.\n\nLet me double-check that. If m were 2, then 3^2 = 9, which doesn't equal 3. If m were 3, then 3^3 = 27, which is also not equal to 3. So, m = 1 seems to be the only integer solution that makes sense here.\n\nWait a minute, but the options given are A. 1, B. 2, C. 3, D. 4. So, according to my calculation, m should be 1. But let's think about this more carefully to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nThe general relationship is rate = k[A]^m. If we triple [A], the new rate is k(3[A])^m = k3^m[A]^m. According to the problem, this new rate is three times the original rate, so:\n\nk3^m[A]^m = 3k[A]^m\n\nWe can divide both sides by k[A]^m (assuming k is nonzero and [A]^m is nonzero), which gives:\n\n3^m = 3\n\nNow, taking the logarithm of both sides:\n\nm * ln(3) = ln(3)\n\nSo, m = ln(3) / ln(3) = 1\n\nThat confirms my earlier conclusion that m = 1.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any other factors at play. The problem states that all other reactants are held constant, so their concentrations shouldn't affect the exponent of A. Also, the reaction rate triples when [A] triples, which directly suggests a first-order dependence on A.\n\nI should also recall that in chemical kinetics, the order of a reaction with respect to a reactant is determined by how the rate changes in response to changes in that reactant's concentration, while keeping others constant. A first-order reaction with respect to A would have a rate that is directly proportional to [A], which matches the scenario here.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider what would happen if m were different from 1.\n\nIf m = 2, then tripling [A] would make the rate 9 times larger, not 3 times larger. That doesn't match the observed result.\n\nIf m = 3, the rate would become 27 times larger, which also doesn't match.\n\nIf m = 4, the rate would be 81 times larger, which is even further from the observed tripling.\n\nTherefore, the only integer value of m that satisfies the condition is m = 1.\n\nI think I've covered all the possible angles here, and everything points to the order being 1 with respect to A. So, the answer should be A. 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
