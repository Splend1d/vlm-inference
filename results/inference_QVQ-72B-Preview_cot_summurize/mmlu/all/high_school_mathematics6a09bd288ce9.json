                    "text": "I have this problem here: \"The circle \\(2x^2 = -2y^2 + 12x - 4y + 20\\) is inscribed inside a square which has a pair of sides parallel to the x-axis. What is the area of the square?\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a circle to be inscribed inside a square. If the circle is inscribed in the square, that means the square is entirely surrounding the circle, and each side of the square touches the circle. Since one pair of sides is parallel to the x-axis, the other pair must be parallel to the y-axis, making it a standard square orientation.\n\nBut wait, actually, if one pair of sides is parallel to the x-axis, the other pair should indeed be parallel to the y-axis. So, the square is aligned with the coordinate axes.\n\nNow, I need to find the area of this square. To do that, I probably need to find the side length of the square first. Since the circle is inscribed in the square, the diameter of the circle should be equal to the side length of the square.\n\nWait, no. Actually, for a circle inscribed in a square, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square. So, if I can find the diameter of the circle, I can find the side length of the square, and then square that to get the area.\n\nBut let's make sure about the relationship. Inscribe means the circle is inside the square, touching the square at exactly four points, one on each side. So, yes, the diameter of the circle should be equal to the side length of the square.\n\nWait a minute, no. If the circle is inscribed in the square, the square is circumscribed about the circle. So, the circle touches the square at exactly four points, one on each side, and the diameter of the circle should be equal to the side length of the square.\n\nBut actually, in such a case, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square. Therefore, the side length of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.\n\nTherefore, to find the area of the square, I need to find the side length, which is equal to the diameter of the circle, and then square it.\n\nSo, first step: find the diameter of the circle.\n\nBut to do that, I need to find the radius of the circle first, and then the diameter is twice the radius.\n\nSo, I need to find the radius of the circle given by the equation \\(2x^2 = -2y^2 + 12x - 4y + 20\\).\n\nHmm, that equation seems a bit messy. It's given in an implicit form, and it doesn't look like the standard form of a circle equation.\n\nThe standard form of a circle's equation is \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center of the circle, and \\(r\\) is the radius.\n\nSo, I need to rearrange the given equation into this standard form to find the radius.\n\nLet's start by writing the equation again: \\(2x^2 = -2y^2 + 12x - 4y + 20\\).\n\nFirst, I can multiply both sides by -1 to make it look more standard: \\(-2x^2 = 2y^2 - 12x + 4y - 20\\).\n\nWait, that doesn't seem helpful. Maybe it's better to get all terms on one side.\n\nSo, let's move all terms to the left side: \\(2x^2 + 2y^2 - 12x + 4y - 20 = 0\\).\n\nHmm, that looks better. Now, I can factor out the coefficients of \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^2\\).\n\nWait, actually, both coefficients are 2, which is convenient.\n\nSo, \\(2(x^2 + y^2 - 6x + 2y - 10) = 0\\).\n\nWait, no. Actually, I can factor out the 2 from the first two terms:\n\n\\(2(x^2 - 6x) + 2(y^2 + 2y) - 20 = 0\\).\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nNow, I can factor out the 2 from the first two groups:\n\n\\(2(x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y) - 20 = 0\\).\n\nWait, no. Actually, when factoring with multiple variables, it's better to keep them separate.\n\nAlternatively, I can complete the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms separately.\n\nSo, starting over:\n\nGiven \\(2x^2 + 2y^2 - 12x + 4y - 20 = 0\\).\n\nFirst, factor out the coefficients of \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^2\\):\n\n\\(2(x^2 - 6x) + 2(y^2 + 2y) - 20 = 0\\).\n\nNow, complete the square for the \\(x\\) terms:\n\n\\(x^2 - 6x\\) can be written as \\((x - 3)^2 - 9\\).\n\nSimilarly, for the \\(y\\) terms:\n\n\\(y^2 + 2y\\) can be written as \\((y + 1)^2 - 1\\).\n\nSo, substituting these back into the equation:\n\n\\(2[(x - 3)^2 - 9] + 2[(y + 1)^2 - 1] - 20 = 0\\).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(2(x - 3)^2 - 18 + 2(y + 1)^2 - 2 - 20 = 0\\).\n\nCombine constants:\n\n\\(2(x - 3)^2 + 2(y + 1)^2 - 40 = 0\\).\n\nNow, move the -40 to the other side:\n\n\\(2(x - 3)^2 + 2(y + 1)^2 = 40\\).\n\nDivide both sides by 2 to simplify:\n\n\\((x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 20\\).\n\nAh, now that's the standard form of a circle equation: \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r^2 = 20\\).\n\nSo, the center of the circle is at \\((3, -1)\\), and the radius squared is 20, so \\(r = \\sqrt{20}\\).\n\nTherefore, the diameter is \\(2r = 2\\sqrt{20}\\).\n\nNow, recall that the side length of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle, since the circle is inscribed in the square.\n\nTherefore, the side length of the square is \\(2\\sqrt{20}\\).\n\nTo find the area of the square, square the side length:\n\nArea = \\((2\\sqrt{20})^2 = 4 \\times 20 = 80\\).\n\nWait, but looking back at the options:\n\nA. 80\n\nB. \\(\\sqrt{20}\\)\n\nC. \\(2\\sqrt{20}\\)\n\nD. 20\n\nSo, option A is 80, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the equation:\n\n\\(2x^2 = -2y^2 + 12x - 4y + 20\\).\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\(2x^2 + 2y^2 - 12x + 4y - 20 = 0\\).\n\nFactor out the 2:\n\n\\(2(x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y) - 20 = 0\\).\n\nComplete the square:\n\n\\(x^2 - 6x\\) becomes \\((x - 3)^2 - 9\\).\n\n\\(y^2 + 2y\\) becomes \\((y + 1)^2 - 1\\).\n\nSubstitute back:\n\n\\(2[(x - 3)^2 - 9] + 2[(y + 1)^2 - 1] - 20 = 0\\).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(2(x - 3)^2 - 18 + 2(y + 1)^2 - 2 - 20 = 0\\).\n\nCombine constants:\n\n\\(2(x - 3)^2 + 2(y + 1)^2 - 40 = 0\\).\n\nMove -40 to the other side:\n\n\\(2(x - 3)^2 + 2(y + 1)^2 = 40\\).\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n\\((x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 20\\).\n\nSo, radius squared \\(r^2 = 20\\), thus \\(r = \\sqrt{20}\\).\n\nDiameter \\(d = 2r = 2\\sqrt{20}\\).\n\nSide length of square \\(s = d = 2\\sqrt{20}\\).\n\nArea of square \\(a = s^2 = (2\\sqrt{20})^2 = 4 \\times 20 = 80\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the square is circumscribed about the circle, so the diameter equals the side length.\n\nWait, but in some contexts, \"inscribed\" can mean different things, but in this case, since the square is outside the circle and the circle is inside the square, touching the sides, it's correctly interpreted as the diameter equaling the side length.\n\nTherefore, the area should be 80.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the coordinates and see if there's any miscalculation.\n\nGiven the center is at (3, -1), and the radius is \\(\\sqrt{20}\\), then the points where the circle touches the square would be at distances equal to the radius from the center along the axes.\n\nSo, along the x-axis, the points would be at \\(x = 3 + \\sqrt{20}\\) and \\(x = 3 - \\sqrt{20}\\).\n\nSimilarly, along the y-axis, \\(y = -1 + \\sqrt{20}\\) and \\(y = -1 - \\sqrt{20}\\).\n\nThe side length of the square would then be the distance between these points, which is \\(2\\sqrt{20}\\), and thus the area is \\( (2\\sqrt{20})^2 = 80 \\).\n\nYes, that confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 80.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
