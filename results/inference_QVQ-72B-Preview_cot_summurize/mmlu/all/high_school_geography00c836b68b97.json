An industrial society with abundant natural resources and large imports of food\n\nB. A society with a highly mechanized agricultural sector\n\nC. A non-ecumene\n\nD. A slash-and-burn agricultural society\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First off, I need to understand what \"population pressure\" means. From what I recall, population pressure refers to the strain on resources caused by a high population density relative to the available resources. So, essentially, when there are too many people for the environment to support adequately.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate each option and see which one is most likely to experience this kind of pressure.\n\nOption A: An industrial society with abundant natural resources and large imports of food.\n\nHmm, industrial societies are typically advanced economically and technologically. They usually have efficient systems for producing and distributing resources. If they have abundant natural resources and can import large amounts of food, that suggests they have the means to support a large population. Maybe they have the financial and technological capabilities to manage their resources effectively, reducing population pressure. So, perhaps this isn't the best candidate for high population pressure.\n\nOption B: A society with a highly mechanized agricultural sector.\n\nMechanized agriculture usually means that farming is done using machines rather than manual labor. This can lead to increased efficiency and higher food production per unit of land. If a society can produce more food with less effort, that should help support a larger population without as much strain on resources. So, again, this might not be the one with the highest population pressure.\n\nOption C: A non-ecumene.\n\nOkay, I need to look up what a non-ecumene is. From my geography classes, I remember that \"ecumene\" refers to the inhabited parts of the Earth. So, a non-ecumene would be an area that's not suitable for permanent human habitation. Places like deserts, dense forests, mountainous regions, or polar areas where conditions are too harsh for people to live year-round.\n\nIf that's the case, then a non-ecumene would have very few people, if any, living there permanently. So, even if the population is growing somewhere else, this area wouldn't be directly experiencing population pressure because it's not where people live. Maybe indirectly, if people try to expand into these areas, but generally, non-ecumenes are sparsely populated or uninhabited.\n\nOption D: A slash-and-burn agricultural society.\n\nThis one seems interesting. Slash-and-burn agriculture is a traditional farming method where forests are cleared by cutting and burning trees and undergrowth to create fields for crops. After a few years, when the soil becomes less fertile, the field is abandoned, and the process is repeated elsewhere.\n\nNow, this type of agriculture is typically practiced in areas with dense forests, often in tropical regions. It's a subsistence farming method, meaning farmers grow just enough food for their own families, not for surplus or trade.\n\nThe problem is that slash-and-burn agriculture can be sustainable only if the population is low and land is abundant. As populations grow, the pressure to produce more food increases, leading to more frequent clearing of land and less time for the land to recover. This can lead to soil depletion, erosion, and ultimately, decreased productivity.\n\nMoreover, as the population density increases, the fallow period between cultivations shortens, which can further degrade the land. This creates a cycle where the land can no longer support the growing population, leading to increased population pressure.\n\nAlso, slash-and-burn agriculture is often associated with small-scale, traditional societies that may not have access to modern agricultural techniques or external resources to mitigate population pressure.\n\nComparing this to the other options:\n\n- Industrial societies with abundant resources and imports can better manage population growth.\n\n- Societies with mechanized agriculture can produce more food efficiently.\n\n- Non-ecumenes are areas where few or no people live permanently.\n\nTherefore, a slash-and-burn agricultural society seems the most likely to experience population pressure due to the combination of limited resources, traditional farming methods, and growing population needs.\n\nI think the answer is D. A slash-and-burn agricultural society.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
