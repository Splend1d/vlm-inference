                    "text": "Alright, so Alice and Bob are worried that if someone compromises their computers today, they might be able to read their old text messages from last month. These messages were sent through an encrypted messaging system, so the encryption should protect them, right? But they're still worried. So, I need to figure out which security property can address this concern.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each option means:\n\nA. Authentication: This is about verifying that the person you're talking to is who they claim to be. Like, making sure that Bob is really Bob and not some impostor. But in this scenario, it seems like Alice and Bob are already communicating, and the concern is about old messages being decrypted, not about impersonation. So, maybe this isn't directly related to their current worry.\n\nB. Deniability: This sounds like the ability to deny that you sent a message, meaning that no one can prove you sent it. It's about non-attribution of the message source. But Alice and Bob are concerned about the content of the messages being revealed if their computers are compromised. Deniability might help prevent someone from proving they sent the messages, but it doesn't directly protect the confidentiality of the message contents. So, maybe not the best fit here.\n\nC. Forward Secrecy: I've heard this term before, especially in the context of secure communications. Forward secrecy is when even if someone compromises the system now, they still can't decrypt past communications. So, it's about protecting past sessions' secrecy even if the current session is compromised. That sounds a lot like what Alice and Bob are worried about. If their computers are compromised today, they don't want last month's messages to be decryptable.\n\nD. Backward Secrecy: This one sounds similar but might be the opposite. If forward secrecy is about protecting past communications from future compromises, maybe backward secrecy is about protecting future communications from past compromises. But that doesn't make much sense. Perhaps it's about ensuring that compromising past keys doesn't reveal future communications. But in this scenario, the compromise is happening today, and the communications were last month, so backward secrecy might not address their concern.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I have it backwards. Let me think again. Forward secrecy is typically about ensuring that if long-term keys are compromised, session keys from past sessions remain secure because they were derived independently for each session. So, if Alice and Bob used a protocol with forward secrecy, even if their computers are compromised today, the session keys from last month shouldn't be affected, and thus their messages from last month should remain confidential.\n\nOn the other hand, backward secrecy would imply that compromising past keys doesn't reveal future communications. But that's not directly relevant here because the compromise is happening after the communications took place.\n\nSo, between these options, forward secrecy seems to be the property that directly addresses their concern. It ensures that even if their computers are compromised today, the encryption protecting their last month's messages remains intact.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way to interpret this. Maybe authentication could indirectly help, but it's not directly about protecting the confidentiality of past messages. Deniability might help in preventing someone from proving who sent the messages, but again, it doesn't directly protect the content of the messages.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer should be C. Forward secrecy.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider an example. Suppose Alice and Bob use a messaging system that uses public-key cryptography for key exchange and session keys for encrypting messages. If they use a protocol like Diffie-Hellman with forward secrecy, then even if their private keys are compromised today, the session keys from last month would still be secure because they were derived based on the ephemeral keys used during that session.\n\nIn contrast, if they didn't have forward secrecy, compromising their private keys today could allow an attacker to decrypt their past communications.\n\nSo, yeah, forward secrecy is the property that addresses their concern about past messages being decrypted if their computers are compromised today.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Forward secrecy}} \\]"
