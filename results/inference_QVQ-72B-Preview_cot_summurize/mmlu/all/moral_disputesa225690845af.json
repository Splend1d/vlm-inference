The question is: \"Advocates of care ethics argue that...\" and then there are four options. I need to pick the one that best represents the view of care ethics advocates.\n\nFirst, option A says that care ethics is an important development of virtue ethics. Hmm, I know that virtue ethics focuses on character and virtues, and care ethics seems to emphasize the virtue of care, especially in relationships and responsibilities. So, it does seem related to virtue ethics. But is it just an important development, or is it something more distinct?\n\nLet me think about that. Care ethics does build upon some ideas from virtue ethics, like the importance of character and particular situations. But it also critiques traditional ethical theories, including virtue ethics, for being too abstract and not paying enough attention to the context and emotions involved in moral decision-making. So, maybe it's both a development and a critique. But perhaps advocates see it more as a development.\n\nMoving on to option B: that traditional moral theories have difficulty explaining the rightness or wrongness of attitudes. This seems plausible. Care ethics emerged in part as a response to the perceived shortcomings of traditional moral theories like utilitarianism and deontology, which are often criticized for being too abstract and not accounting for the particularities of specific situations, especially those involving care and relationships.\n\nMoreover, traditional theories might not adequately address the moral significance of emotions and empathy in ethical decision-making. Care ethics emphasizes the importance of these elements, suggesting that attitudes like care and compassion are central to morality.\n\nSo, this option seems like a strong candidate. But let's look at the others to be sure.\n\nOption C states that the only important moral concepts are care and compassion. That seems a bit extreme. While care ethics does prioritize care and compassion, I don't think it would claim that these are the only moral concepts that matter. There are likely other values and principles that care ethicists would consider important, even if care is central to their approach.\n\nTherefore, this option might be too narrow.\n\nOption D says that we should think about welfare and happiness in terms of sympathy. Sympathy is an emotion that care ethics values, but again, it's not the only aspect. Care ethics is more about the relationships and responsibilities that arise from caring for others, not just sympathy in the abstract.\n\nSo, while sympathy is relevant, it's not the whole picture.\n\nComparing all the options, option B seems to be the most accurate representation of what care ethics advocates would argue. They do emphasize that traditional moral theories struggle to adequately account for the moral significance of attitudes like care and compassion, which are crucial in many ethical scenarios.\n\nI think the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
