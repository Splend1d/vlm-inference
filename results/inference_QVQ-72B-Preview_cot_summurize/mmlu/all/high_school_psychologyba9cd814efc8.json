                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these options is an example of operant conditioning. Operant conditioning is when behavior is influenced by its consequences, right? Like, if a behavior is followed by a reward, it's more likely to happen again, and if it's followed by punishment, it's less likely to happen. There are also things like positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, positive punishment, and negative punishment. I need to see which of these scenarios fits into that framework.\n\nLet's look at option A: Milo starts at the sound of a buzzer because it sounds very similar to the alarm clock that wakes him every morning. Hmm, this seems more like classical conditioning. In classical conditioning, you have a stimulus that naturally elicits a response, and then you pair it with another stimulus so that the second stimulus also elicits the same response. Here, the buzzer is similar to the alarm clock, which wakes him up, so when he hears the buzzer, he reacts because it's similar to the alarm clock. But this isn't really about the consequences of his behavior; it's about the stimulus triggering a response. So, probably not operant conditioning.\n\nOption B: Paula is promoted to vice president of her company and vows to not lose touch with her employees. Okay, so Paula gets promoted, which is a positive outcome, and as a result, she makes a resolution to stay connected with her employees. Is this operant conditioning? Well, the promotion is a reward, and her vow to stay connected could be seen as a behavior she's reinforcing because it led to the promotion. But it's a bit unclear. Is her vow a behavior that she's continuing because it was reinforced by the promotion? Maybe, but it seems more like a decision she makes after receiving the promotion.\n\nOption C: Rebecca cancels her credit card to avoid paying the annual fee but plans to reinstate it in the new year. So, Rebecca is canceling her credit card to avoid the annual fee, which is a cost. Then she plans to reinstate it later. This seems like she's avoiding a negative consequence (paying the fee) by canceling the card temporarily. In operant conditioning, avoiding a negative stimulus is called negative reinforcement. Wait, no, that's actually escape conditioning. Negative reinforcement is when removing an unpleasant stimulus increases the likelihood of a behavior. But in this case, she's canceling the card to avoid paying the fee, which is more about escaping the negative consequence rather than having her behavior reinforced by the removal of the negative stimulus. This is getting a bit confusing.\n\nOption D: Ashmed speaks louder than usual when he talks to his mother on the phone because she is hard of hearing. So, Ashmed adjusts his speaking volume because his mother has hearing difficulties. This seems like he's modifying his behavior based on the situation, but is this operant conditioning? Well, if he spoke louder and his mother could hear him better, which is a positive outcome, then maybe he's more likely to speak louder in the future. But it's not entirely clear if this is a learned behavior based on past consequences or just a conscious adjustment he makes.\n\nHmm, none of these seem like straightforward examples of operant conditioning. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me recall the definition again: operant conditioning is when behavior is modified based on its consequences. So, if a behavior is followed by a reward, it's more likely to occur again; if followed by punishment, it's less likely.\n\nLooking back at option A, Milo starting at the buzzer because it sounds like his alarm clock, that's more about a reflexive response to a similar stimulus, which is classical conditioning.\n\nOption B, Paula's promotion and her vow to stay connected with employees, the promotion is a positive outcome, but her vow seems more like a personal commitment rather than a behavior being reinforced by the promotion. Maybe if she continues to stay connected with employees because it led to her promotion, that could be operant conditioning, but it's not entirely clear.\n\nOption C, Rebecca canceling her credit card to avoid the annual fee, this seems like she's avoiding a negative consequence. In operant conditioning, avoiding a negative stimulus before it occurs is called negative reinforcement. Wait, no, avoidance learning is when an organism learns to perform an action to prevent an aversive stimulus from occurring. So, in this case, canceling the card prevents her from having to pay the annual fee, which is aversive. So, perhaps this is an example of operant conditioning, specifically avoidance learning.\n\nOption D, Ashmed speaking louder to his mother because she's hard of hearing, this could be seen as a behavior that leads to a positive outcome (better communication), so maybe it's positively reinforced. But it feels more like a logical adjustment rather than a learned behavior through consequences.\n\nComparing all options, option C seems to be the closest to operant conditioning, particularly avoidance learning, where Rebecca learns to cancel her credit card to avoid paying the annual fee.\n\nWait a minute, is avoidance learning considered operant conditioning? Yes, because it involves modifying behavior based on the consequences\u2014specifically, avoiding a negative consequence. So, in this case, Rebecca's behavior of canceling the card is reinforced by the avoidance of paying the annual fee.\n\nIn contrast, option A is classical conditioning, option B is more about personal resolution after a positive event, and option D is a practical adjustment rather than a learned behavior through consequences.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
