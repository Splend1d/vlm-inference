                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out what the legal relationship is between the boss and the employee after this whole situation. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the employee finds his boss passed out and not breathing, performs CPR, and saves his life. Then, the boss comes back to work two weeks later and tells the employee he'll have a job with him for life as a way of saying thanks for saving his life. Now, I need to see what kind of legal relationship this creates between them.\n\nOption A says that according to the boss's oral promise, the employee has an enforceable lifetime employment contract. Hmm, but I remember that employment contracts, especially ones that involve long-term commitments like lifetime employment, might need to be in writing to be enforceable under the statute of frauds. I think in many jurisdictions, contracts that can't be fully performed within a year need to be in writing. So, if this promise was just oral, maybe it's not enforceable. But maybe there are exceptions for life-saving acts or something.\n\nOption B says the boss has a duty to pay the employee reasonable compensation for saving his life based on a contract implied-in-fact. Okay, so an implied-in-fact contract is when there's an understanding or agreement between parties even if it's not explicitly stated. But in this case, the employee performed CPR without any prior agreement for compensation. I think generally, there's a duty to rescue someone in peril if you can do so without risking your own life, but I'm not sure about the compensation part. Maybe in some situations, if someone specifically hires someone to save them, there could be an implied contract, but this seems different. Maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nOption C says the employee's act of saving the boss's life is sufficient past consideration to make the boss's subsequent promise enforceable. Okay, so consideration is what each party gives up or promises in exchange for something else. Past consideration is generally not considered valid consideration for a new contract. Like, if I mowed your lawn last week and now you promise to pay me, that promise might not be enforceable because the act was in the past. But maybe there are exceptions, especially in cases where one party confers a significant benefit on another and the other party accepts that benefit and promises something in return. Maybe in this life-saving situation, it could be different.\n\nOption D says that since the employee gratuitously rendered assistance to the boss, there's insufficient consideration to support the boss's subsequent promise to provide lifetime employment. This seems similar to the idea that past consideration isn't valid. If the employee helped the boss without any expectation of reward, then the boss's later promise might not be enforceable because there was no bargain or exchange at that time.\n\nSo, weighing these options, I need to think about whether the boss's promise of lifetime employment is enforceable based on the employee's life-saving actions.\n\nFirst, regarding the statute of frauds, if lifetime employment is considered an employment contract that would span more than a year, it probably needs to be in writing to be enforceable. Since it was only an oral promise, that might make it unenforceable.\n\nBut maybe there are exceptions for heroic acts or life-saving interventions. Maybe the law recognizes that in such exceptional circumstances, an oral promise might be enforceable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an implied contract here, where the employee's act of saving the boss's life implies that the boss owes some sort of compensation. But I'm not sure if that would necessarily be lifetime employment.\n\nThe concept of past consideration is tricky. Generally, if you do something and then later someone promises you something in return, that promise might not be enforceable because the consideration was in the past. However, there might be exceptions if the act was particularly extraordinary, like saving someone's life.\n\nMaybe the court would consider the employee's act as sufficient consideration for the boss's promise, given the exceptional nature of the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, perhaps the employee acted out of a moral duty to help someone in danger and didn't expect anything in return, so the boss's later promise isn't supported by new consideration.\n\nI think the key here is whether the employee's act of saving the boss's life can be considered consideration for the boss's promise of lifetime employment.\n\nIf the employee had saved the boss's life with the understanding or agreement that they would receive lifetime employment in return, that might be different. But in this scenario, the promise comes after the act.\n\nSo, in contract law, generally, past acts don't constitute valid consideration for new promises. The consideration must be contemporaneous or at least promised in exchange for the act.\n\nTherefore, if the employee performed CPR without any prior agreement for lifetime employment, and the boss only makes that promise afterward, it's likely that the promise lacks consideration and thus isn't enforceable.\n\nBut maybe there's an exception for life-saving acts, or perhaps the employee's act could be seen as inducing the boss's promise, making it enforceable.\n\nI think option D is the most straightforward interpretation: since the employee helped without any expectation of reward, there's insufficient consideration for the boss's subsequent promise.\n\nHowever, options A, B, and C suggest different possibilities, so I need to consider those as well.\n\nOption A suggests that the oral promise is enforceable, but as I thought earlier, the statute of frauds might require such long-term employment contracts to be in writing.\n\nOption B talks about a contract implied-in-fact, but I'm not sure if that applies here since there was no prior agreement for compensation.\n\nOption C suggests that the employee's past act is sufficient consideration, but generally, past consideration isn't valid.\n\nSo, balancing these, it seems that option D is the most accurate: without consideration supporting the promise, it's not enforceable.\n\nBut let me think about it differently. Suppose the employee had saved the boss's life, and the boss, in gratitude, promised lifetime employment. Could the employee enforce that promise if the boss later decided to renege on it?\n\nIn some jurisdictions, there might be a moral or ethical obligation to fulfill such a promise, but legally, without proper consideration, it's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a theory of promissory estoppel that could apply here. If the employee relied on the boss's promise to their detriment, perhaps by turning down other job offers or making long-term plans based on the promise, then the promise might be enforceable to prevent unfairness.\n\nBut that's a bit different from a contract; it's more about preventing the boss from going back on a promise that the employee has reasonably relied upon.\n\nGiven that the question is about the legal relationship characterized by a contract, promissory estoppel might not be the primary consideration here.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the best answer is D: since the employee gratuitously rendered assistance to the boss, there was insufficient consideration to support the boss's subsequent promise to provide the employee with lifetime employment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
