                    "text": "Let's see what this question is about. So, there's a scientist experimenting with hearing aids on genetically modified mice that have hearing loss. They fit these mice with the latest hearing aid technology and test them to press a lever when they hear a bell. The bell's power is set to different levels: 80%, 70%, and 60%. At each power level, a certain number of mice press the lever:\n\n- At 80% power, 20 mice pressed the lever.\n\n- At 70% power, 15 mice pressed the lever.\n\n- At 60% power, 10 mice pressed the lever.\n\nAnd there are 30 mice in total. The question is asking which of these power levels corresponds to the absolute threshold for hearing the decibels produced by the bell. The options are A. 80%, B. 70%, C. 60%, or D. Not enough information given.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what an absolute threshold is. From what I remember in psychology, the absolute threshold is the minimum intensity of a stimulus that a person (or in this case, a mouse) can detect 50% of the time. So, it's like the lowest level at which the stimulus can be perceived half the time.\n\nIn this experiment, the stimulus is the bell with different power levels, and we're looking at how many mice press the lever when they hear it at each level.\n\nSo, at 80% power, 20 out of 30 mice pressed the lever. That's about 66.67% of them.\n\nAt 70% power, 15 out of 30 pressed the lever, which is 50%.\n\nAt 60% power, 10 out of 30 pressed the lever, which is about 33.33%.\n\nSo, at 70% power, exactly half of the mice pressed the lever.\n\nDoes that mean that 70% power is the absolute threshold?\n\nWait a minute, absolute threshold is defined as the minimum intensity that can be detected 50% of the time. Here, at 70% power, exactly 50% of the mice detected it. So, it seems like 70% power corresponds to the absolute threshold.\n\nBut let's think carefully. Is there any other information or possible interpretations?\n\nFirst, is the absolute threshold being defined per mouse or for the group? In psychophysics, absolute threshold is typically defined for an individual, but in this case, since we're dealing with a group of mice, perhaps we're looking at the group's response.\n\nAlso, the absolute threshold is the minimum intensity that is detected 50% of the time. So, if at 70% power, exactly 50% of the mice detected it, that might suggest that 70% power is the absolute threshold for the group.\n\nBut wait, at 60% power, only 33.33% detected it, and at 80% power, 66.67% detected it. So, it seems like as the power increases, more mice detect the sound.\n\nBut, the absolute threshold is the minimum intensity where 50% detect it. So, at 70% power, exactly 50% detect it, which fits the definition.\n\nHowever, let's consider if there's any other information we might need or if there's a different way to interpret this.\n\nThe question mentions \"the absolute threshold for hearing the decibels produced by the bell.\" Decibels are units of sound intensity, and power percentage might relate to decibel levels. But without knowing the actual decibel values corresponding to these power percentages, can we determine the absolute threshold?\n\nWait, maybe the percentages are relative to some maximum decibel level. But the question doesn't provide that information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the power percentages are directly correlated with decibel levels, such that 80% power corresponds to a higher decibel level, 70% to medium, and 60% to lower.\n\nBut again, without knowing the exact decibel values, it's hard to say.\n\nHowever, since the question is asking which power level corresponds to the absolute threshold, and based on the data provided, at 70% power, exactly 50% of the mice detected the sound, which aligns with the definition of absolute threshold.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B. 70%.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nSuppose that the absolute threshold varies between mice due to individual differences. In such a case, some mice might detect the sound at lower intensities, while others need higher intensities.\n\nIf we have a distribution of thresholds, the group's absolute threshold would be the intensity at which 50% of the group detects the sound.\n\nGiven that at 70% power, exactly 15 out of 30 mice detected it, which is 50%, this seems to fit the definition.\n\nAt 80% power, more mice detected it (66.67%), which would be above the threshold, and at 60% power, fewer mice detected it (33.33%), which would be below the threshold.\n\nTherefore, the absolute threshold for the group is at 70% power.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 70%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
