                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this sleep study question. It says that the participant's eyes are beginning to dart as if he were watching a sporting event, and the researcher notes that the participant has entered a specific type of sleep. The options are stage 3 sleep, beta sleep, REM sleep, and NREM sleep. I need to pick the correct one from these choices.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what each of these sleep stages involves, especially regarding eye movements.\n\nStarting with stage 3 sleep: I think this is part of the deeper non-REM sleep stages. In stage 3, also known as slow-wave sleep, the brain produces delta waves, which are slow brainwaves. During this stage, eye movements are usually slow or non-existent. So, if the participant's eyes are dartsing around, that doesn't sound like stage 3 sleep. Maybe I should look into beta sleep next.\n\nBeta sleep sounds a bit unfamiliar. I know that during wakefulness, our brainwaves are mostly in the beta frequency, which are faster waves associated with alertness and active thinking. But in sleep, we typically talk about NREM (non-rapid eye movement) and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. Maybe \"beta sleep\" isn't a standard term in sleep stages. Perhaps it's a misinterpretation or a typo.\n\nMoving on to REM sleep: This is the stage where we dream, and it's characterized by rapid eye movements. The eyes move quickly in a back-and-forth motion, which can make them appear as if they're darting around, like watching a sporting event. This seems plausible.\n\nNREM sleep is the other main type of sleep, divided into stages 1, 2, and 3. Stage 1 is light sleep, stage 2 is moderate sleep, and stage 3 is deep sleep. In NREM sleep, eye movements are generally slow or absent, especially in the deeper stages.\n\nGiven this information, REM sleep seems to match the description of the participant's eyes darting around. REM sleep is known for its rapid eye movements, which align with the idea of eyes moving quickly, as if following an exciting event like a sporting match.\n\nLet me double-check. In REM sleep, the brain is active, and dreams are most vivid, often accompanied by these rapid eye movements. The eyes move rapidly, even though the body is mostly paralyzed to prevent acting out dreams.\n\nSo, if the researcher observed the participant's eyes darting as if watching a sporting event, that suggests rapid, perhaps erratic movements, which is characteristic of REM sleep.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. REM sleep.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility it could be another stage.\n\nStage 3 sleep is deep NREM sleep, where eye movements are minimal or non-existent. So, unlikely.\n\nBeta sleep isn't a recognized sleep stage, so that probably isn't correct.\n\nNREM sleep generally doesn't involve rapid eye movements; that's more specific to REM sleep.\n\nThus, the best answer is C. REM sleep.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
