                    "text": "So I've got this expression to simplify: \\(\\frac{k-3}{2} + 3k + 1 + \\frac{3k+1}{2}\\). I need to make it as simple as possible, and then match it to one of the options provided. Let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are fractions here, both involving the denominator 2. Maybe I can combine the fractions to make things easier. But before that, I should look at the terms that don't have fractions as well. There's a \\(3k\\) and another \\(3k\\) in the fractions, and some constants too.\n\nLet me try to combine like terms. Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power. So, all the \\(k\\) terms and all the constant terms should be combined separately.\n\nStarting with the \\(k\\) terms:\n\nThere's \\(\\frac{k-3}{2}\\), which can be split into \\(\\frac{k}{2}\\) and \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\nThen there's \\(3k\\), which is just \\(3k\\).\n\nAnd \\(\\frac{3k+1}{2}\\), which can be split into \\(\\frac{3k}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nSo, putting all the \\(k\\) terms together:\n\n\\(\\frac{k}{2} + 3k + \\frac{3k}{2}\\)\n\nLet me add \\(\\frac{k}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{3k}{2}\\) first. Since they have the same denominator, I can combine them:\n\n\\(\\frac{k}{2} + \\frac{3k}{2} = \\frac{4k}{2}\\)\n\nAnd \\(\\frac{4k}{2}\\) simplifies to \\(2k\\).\n\nThen, adding the remaining \\(3k\\):\n\n\\(2k + 3k = 5k\\)\n\nNow, for the constant terms:\n\nFrom earlier, we have \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), and also \\(1\\).\n\nLet's combine \\(-\\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\):\n\n\\(-\\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{2}{2} = -1\\)\n\nThen add the remaining constant \\(1\\):\n\n\\(-1 + 1 = 0\\)\n\nSo, putting it all together, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\(5k + 0\\), which is just \\(5k\\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \\(3k + 1\\)\n\nB. \\(5k\\)\n\nC. \\(3k\\)\n\nD. \\(1\\)\n\nSo, the simplified form of the expression is \\(5k\\), which corresponds to option B.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with \\(\\frac{k-3}{2} + 3k + 1 + \\frac{3k+1}{2}\\):\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n\\(\\frac{k}{2} - \\frac{3}{2} + 3k + 1 + \\frac{3k}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nNow, combining like terms:\n\nFor \\(k\\):\n\n\\(\\frac{k}{2} + 3k + \\frac{3k}{2} = \\frac{1k + 6k + 3k}{2} = \\frac{10k}{2} = 5k\\)\n\nWait, hold on. I think I might have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, \\(\\frac{k}{2} + 3k + \\frac{3k}{2}\\):\n\nLet's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, \\(\\frac{k}{2} + \\frac{3k}{2} = \\frac{4k}{2} = 2k\\)\n\nThen, \\(2k + 3k = 5k\\)\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the constants:\n\n\\(-\\frac{3}{2} + 1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nCombining \\(-\\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = -1\\), and then \\(-1 + 1 = 0\\)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to \\(5k + 0 = 5k\\)\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(5k\\), which is option B.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this.\n\nMaybe I can factor or find common denominators differently, but I think the way I did it is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could try plugging in a value for \\(k\\) to check my work.\n\nLet's say \\(k = 2\\):\n\nOriginal expression: \\(\\frac{2-3}{2} + 3(2) + 1 + \\frac{3(2)+1}{2} = \\frac{-1}{2} + 6 + 1 + \\frac{7}{2} = -0.5 + 6 + 1 + 3.5\\)\n\nCalculating that: \\(-0.5 + 6 = 5.5\\), plus 1 is 6.5, plus 3.5 is 10.\n\nNow, plugging \\(k = 2\\) into the simplified expression \\(5k = 5(2) = 10\\), which matches.\n\nLet me try another value, say \\(k = 0\\):\n\nOriginal expression: \\(\\frac{0-3}{2} + 3(0) + 1 + \\frac{3(0)+1}{2} = \\frac{-3}{2} + 0 + 1 + \\frac{1}{2} = -1.5 + 0 + 1 + 0.5 = 0\\)\n\nSimplified expression: \\(5(0) = 0\\), which also matches.\n\nOne more check, \\(k = 1\\):\n\nOriginal expression: \\(\\frac{1-3}{2} + 3(1) + 1 + \\frac{3(1)+1}{2} = \\frac{-2}{2} + 3 + 1 + \\frac{4}{2} = -1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 5\\)\n\nSimplified expression: \\(5(1) = 5\\), matching again.\n\nSo, based on these checks, it seems my simplification is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\(5k\\), which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5k} \\]"
