                    "text": "So I have this question about intravenous drug administration, and I need to pick the true statement from the options provided. Let's go through each one carefully.\n\nOption A says that IV administration of a drug will delay its action. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. I thought that IV administration was the fastest way to get a drug into the bloodstream, which should mean it acts quicker, not slower. Maybe I'm confusing it with oral administration, where the drug has to be absorbed through the digestive system, which can take time. So, if I give a drug intravenously, it should start working almost immediately, right? So, option A seems false.\n\nOption B says that IV administration carries a low risk of bacteraemia. Bacteraemia is when bacteria enter the bloodstream, which can be dangerous. IV lines can be a route for bacteria to get into the blood, especially if the insertion site isn't kept clean or if the IV equipment is contaminated. So, actually, there is a risk of bacteraemia with IV administration, although modern aseptic techniques try to minimize this. So, saying it carries a low risk might not be entirely accurate, because there is still a potential risk, however small. Maybe this option is false too.\n\nOption C says that IV administration allows titration of a drug with its desired effect. Titration means adjusting the dose of a medication to achieve a specific therapeutic effect without causing side effects. With IV administration, especially infusions, you can control the rate at which the drug is given, allowing for precise adjustments based on the patient's response. For example, with pain medication, you can start at a low dose and increase it gradually until the patient reports adequate pain relief. Similarly, with hypertension, you can adjust the infusion rate to control blood pressure effectively. So, this seems correct. IV administration does allow for titration of a drug to achieve the desired effect.\n\nOption D says that an intravenous cannula should never be used for both drug and fluid administration. Well, that seems extreme. IV cannulas are commonly used for both administering medications and infusing fluids, like saline or dextrose solutions. In many clinical settings, it's standard practice to use the same IV line for both purposes. Of course, there are guidelines about compatible medications and fluids to prevent precipitation or incompatibilities, but generally, IV cannulas are used for multiple purposes. So, saying \"never\" seems incorrect.\n\nAlright, let's summarize:\n\n- Option A: IV administration will delay a drug's action \u2013 seems false, as IV is typically fast-acting.\n\n- Option B: IV administration carries a low risk of bacteraemia \u2013 while modern practices aim to minimize this risk, there is still a potential for infection, so it's not entirely accurate to say \"low risk.\"\n\n- Option C: IV administration allows titration of a drug with its desired effect \u2013 this seems correct and is a key advantage of IV administration.\n\n- Option D: An IV cannula should never be used for both drug and fluid administration \u2013 this contradicts common practice, where IV lines are often used for both purposes.\n\nTherefore, the true statement is Option C: IV administration allows titration of a drug with its desired effect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
