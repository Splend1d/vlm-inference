I need to figure out which one of these is an investment account.\n\nFirst off, I know that an investment account is typically something where you put money in, and it grows over time, often for retirement or specific financial goals. So, I should look for an option that fits that description.\n\nLet's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: CNN. I know CNN is a news network. They report news and current events. I don't think they offer investment accounts. Maybe they have some financial news, but that doesn't make them an investment account. So, probably not the right choice.\n\nOption B: EMC. Hmm, EMC. I think EMC is a company that deals with data storage and management. They might be involved in technology and infrastructure, but again, I don't recall them offering investment accounts. Maybe they have employee retirement plans, but that's internal to their company. So, probably not a commonly-known investment account.\n\nOption C: IRA. IRA stands for Individual Retirement Account. I've heard of this before. It sounds familiar in the context of retirement savings. I think people often contribute to IRAs to save for retirement, and there might be tax advantages or something like that. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption D: IRS. IRS is the Internal Revenue Service. That's the government agency responsible for collecting taxes and enforcing tax laws. They don't offer investment accounts; they're more about tax collection and regulation. So, definitely not an investment account.\n\nAlright, after considering all these options, it seems like IRA is the most fitting choice. It's specifically designed as an investment account for retirement savings, whereas the other options are either companies or government agencies that don't provide such services.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should double-check. Let me think about it differently. If someone wants to open an investment account, where would they go? Typically, they might go to a bank, a brokerage firm, or some financial institution that offers investment products.\n\nCNN is a media outlet, EMC is a technology company, and IRS is a government tax agency. None of these seem like places where you'd open an investment account. IRA, on the other hand, is a type of account that allows individuals to invest money for their retirement, often with tax benefits.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty confident that IRA is the correct answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. IRA}} \\]"
