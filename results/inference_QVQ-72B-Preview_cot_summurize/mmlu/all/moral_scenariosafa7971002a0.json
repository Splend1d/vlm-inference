                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. There are two situations presented:\n\n**Scenario 1:** \"When I saw that granny's prescription was the wrong medicine, I gave it to her.\"\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I had my glasses to help me pass the vision test for my license.\"\n\nSo, the question is asking whether each of these actions is morally wrong or not, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet me consider Scenario 1 first.\n\nIn Scenario 1, someone realizes that a granny's prescription is wrong but decides to give it to her anyway. Now, giving someone the wrong medicine can be dangerous, especially for elderly people who might have specific health conditions that require precise medication. If someone knows that the medicine is incorrect and still gives it to the person, that could potentially harm the granny. In medical ethics, there's a principle called \"do no harm,\" which suggests that one should avoid causing harm to patients. By giving the wrong medicine knowingly, this principle is being violated.\n\nMoreover, trust is a fundamental aspect of patient-caregiver relationships. If a caregiver deliberately gives the wrong medicine, it breaches that trust and can have severe consequences for the patient's health.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems pretty clear that giving someone the wrong medicine when you know it's incorrect is morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2.\n\nIn Scenario 2, someone uses their glasses to help pass a vision test for their driver's license. The question is whether this action is morally wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the purpose of a vision test for a driver's license is. Vision tests are typically used to ensure that drivers have the necessary visual acuity and field of vision to operate a vehicle safely. The idea is to prevent accidents caused by poor vision.\n\nNow, if someone uses glasses to pass this test, is that cheating or is it acceptable?\n\nWell, generally, driver's license vision tests allow for the use of corrective lenses, including glasses or contact lenses. In fact, in many places, the test is performed both with and without corrective lenses to determine the driver's visual capabilities in both scenarios.\n\nAssuming that the test permits the use of glasses, then using glasses to pass the vision test is perfectly acceptable and not morally wrong. It's akin to wearing shoes to pass a walking test \u2013 it's using a tool to meet the required standards.\n\nHowever, if the test specifically prohibits the use of corrective lenses, then using glasses to pass the test could be considered cheating, which would be morally wrong.\n\nBut, from my understanding, in most states in the US, vision tests for driver's licenses do allow for corrective lenses. So, in this case, using glasses to pass the test is not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, Scenario 1 involves doing something morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does not.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the way the question is phrased, it seems like it's presenting two scenarios and asking for judgments on both. So, if Scenario 1 is wrong and Scenario 2 is not wrong, then option B seems to fit.\n\nHowever, I should double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nLet me think about Scenario 1 again. Is there any way that giving the wrong medicine could be considered not morally wrong?\n\nWell, perhaps if the person giving the medicine didn't know it was the wrong one, then it might not be morally wrong. But in this scenario, it says, \"when I saw that granny's prescription was the wrong medicine, I gave it to her.\" So, the person knew it was the wrong medicine but gave it anyway. That seems intentional and reckless, hence morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, using glasses to pass the vision test, assuming it's allowed, is not wrong. But what if the person was supposed to take the test without glasses? Would that change things?\n\nAfter checking, I found that in many states, vision tests for driver's licenses are performed with corrective lenses if the person normally wears them. So, using glasses is acceptable and helps ensure that the person can drive safely while wearing them.\n\nTherefore, in this context, using glasses to pass the vision test is not morally wrong.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
