Hmm, I need to figure out which one is the correct common term for this condition.\n\nFirst off, I know that when someone has trouble seeing things far away, it means they can see close objects clearly but distant ones are blurry. So, the condition is related to how the eye focuses light.\n\nLet me think about the terms:\n\nA. Farsighted: Doesn't that mean someone who can see far away clearly? Wait, but maybe it's the opposite. Maybe farsighted means they can see far better than near, which would make sense for someone who has trouble seeing close objects. But in this case, the question is about seeing objects in the distance, which is far away, right?\n\nB. Nearsighted: This sounds like someone who can see near things well but has trouble with far things. So, if the person has difficulty seeing objects in the distance, that would make sense with being nearsighted.\n\nC. Hindsighted: Hmm, I'm not sure about this one. It sounds a bit like hindsight, which is looking back in time, but that doesn't seem relevant here. Maybe it's not a standard term for vision problems.\n\nD. Hypermetropic: This sounds scientific, probably from optics or optometry. I think hypermetropia is a term used for farsightedness, where the eye is unable to focus on close objects clearly.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like B. nearsighted is the common term for someone who has difficulty seeing objects in the distance. But let me double-check.\n\nI recall that nearsightedness is also called myopia. People with myopia can see nearby objects clearly but have trouble with distant vision. So, that matches the description in the question.\n\nFarsightedness, or hypermetropia, is when people can see distant objects clearly but have difficulty with close vision. So, that's the opposite of what the question is asking.\n\nHindsighted doesn't seem to be a recognized term in optics. Maybe it's a mistranslation or a typo.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. nearsighted.\n\nWait a minute, let me consider if there's any chance that hindsighted could be a valid term. Maybe in some contexts, but I don't think it's a standard term for vision impairment related to distance.\n\nAlso, hypermetropic is indeed the technical term for farsightedness, which again, is the opposite of what the question is describing.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I'm confident that B. nearsighted is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. nearsighted}} \\]"
