I'm not entirely sure about the legal definitions, but I think burglary involves entering a building unlawfully with the intent to commit a crime inside. So, I should look at each scenario and see if that's the case.\n\nStarting with option A: A defendant broke into a house to seek shelter from a severe snowstorm. The next morning, he noticed a transistor radio and put it in his pocket before leaving. So, he entered the house without permission, but his initial intent was to find shelter, not to steal anything. The stealing happened after he was already inside. Does that still count as burglary? Maybe not, because the intent to commit a crime wasn't present at the time of entry. But I'm not sure; maybe the fact that he took something while inside changes things.\n\nMoving on to option B: A defendant saw the homeowner sitting in a chair near the window and, being angry, picked up a brick and threw it through the window, intending to kill the homeowner. This seems more like an attempted murder or assault rather than burglary. He didn't enter the house; he just threw a brick through the window. So, probably not burglary.\n\nOption C: Two defendants saw an open window at a doctor's office late one afternoon and crawled through it. They broke open the medicine cabinet and stole various drugs. This seems a lot like burglary to me. They entered the building unlawfully through an open window and committed a crime inside by stealing drugs. So, this should be considered burglary.\n\nOption D: Late one evening, a defendant noticed a guest at a hotel who owed him money from a bet. After the guest retired to his room, the defendant broke into the room and threatened him regarding the money he was owed. This seems tricky. He broke into the room to confront the guest about the debt, which might be considered a civil dispute, but breaking into the room is a criminal act. I think this could be considered burglary because he entered the room unlawfully with the intent to confront or threaten the guest.\n\nSo, from these scenarios, options C and D seem like clear cases of burglary. Option A is a bit grey because the initial intent was to seek shelter, not to steal, but taking the radio might complicate things. Option B doesn't involve entering the building, so it's probably not burglary.\n\nBut I should double-check. Maybe look up the legal definition of burglary to be sure. I recall that burglary is typically defined as the unlawful entry of a building with intent to commit a felony or theft therein. So, in option A, the entry was unlawful, but the initial intent was to seek shelter, not to steal. The stealing happened after entry. Does that still constitute burglary? Maybe it's considered burglary because once you're inside, any crime committed could be seen as part of the burglary.\n\nWait, but I think there's a distinction between burglary and robbery. Robbery involves taking property by force or intimidation, whereas burglary is about unlawful entry with intent to commit a crime. In option A, the entry was unlawful, but the intent to steal wasn't present at the time of entry. So, perhaps it's not burglary.\n\nIn option B, the defendant didn't enter the building; he just threw a brick through the window. That sounds like attempted murder or assault, but not burglary since there was no entry.\n\nOption C seems straightforward: unlawful entry with the intent to steal drugs. That fits the definition of burglary.\n\nOption D: Unlawful entry with the intent to confront and threaten someone. That could be considered burglary because it's an unlawful entry with intent to commit a crime, even if the crime is threatening behavior.\n\nSo, my final answer would be options C and D constitute burglary.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C, \\ D} \\]"
