                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that one cardboard strip is 5 over 6 feet wide, and another is 2 over 3 feet wide. I need to estimate the combined width of both strips. The options are 2 feet, 1 and a half feet, 1 foot, or 3 feet.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I have two pieces of cardboard, each with a certain width, and I need to find out how wide they are together. So, I need to add their widths.\n\nThe widths are given as fractions: 5/6 feet and 2/3 feet. To add these fractions, I need a common denominator. I know that 6 and 3 have a common multiple of 6, so I can use 6 as the common denominator.\n\nTo convert 2/3 to sixths, I multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2, so 2/3 becomes 4/6.\n\nNow, I can add 5/6 and 4/6. Adding the numerators: 5 plus 4 is 9, and the denominator remains 6. So, the exact sum is 9/6 feet.\n\nBut the problem asks for an estimate. So, I need to approximate this fraction to get a sense of how much 9/6 is in whole numbers or simpler fractions.\n\nFirst, I can simplify 9/6. Both 9 and 6 are divisible by 3. So, 9 divided by 3 is 3, and 6 divided by 3 is 2, so 9/6 simplifies to 3/2, which is 1 and a half feet.\n\nLooking back at the options, that corresponds to option B, 1 and 1 over 2 feet.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's another way to estimate this or if maybe the exact calculation is sufficient for estimation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the sizes. 5/6 is almost 1, and 2/3 is also almost 1. But 5/6 is roughly 0.833, and 2/3 is about 0.666. Adding them up gives approximately 1.5, which again points to 1 and a half feet.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that 5/6 plus 2/3 is the same as 5/6 plus 4/6, which equals 9/6. As I already calculated, that's 1.5 feet.\n\nSo, based on both the exact calculation and the decimal approximation, the combined width is about 1.5 feet.\n\nWait a minute, the options include fractions and whole numbers. Let's see:\n\nA. 2 ft\n\nB. 1 and 1 over 2 ft (which is 1.5 ft)\n\nC. 1 ft\n\nD. 3 ft\n\nSo, 1.5 ft is option B.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret \"combined width.\" Maybe it's not just adding the widths directly, but considering how they fit together or something like that. However, the problem seems straightforward: it's just asking for the sum of the two widths.\n\nAlso, perhaps there's a unit conversion involved, but I don't think so, as both measurements are in feet.\n\nLet me check the wording again: \"estimate the combined width of the cardboard strips.\"\n\nCombined width should just be the sum of their individual widths, right? So, adding 5/6 and 2/3 feet should give the total width.\n\nI think I'm overthinking it. The answer should be straightforward: 5/6 + 2/3 = 9/6 = 3/2 feet, which is 1.5 feet.\n\nSo, the correct estimate is 1 and a half feet, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
