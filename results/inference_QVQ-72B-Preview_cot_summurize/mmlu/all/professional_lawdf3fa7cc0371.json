                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a homeowner and a landscaper, and I need to figure out what kind of legal effect the landscaper's promise has on March 25th. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a contract between the homeowner and the landscaper to landscape the front yard. This contract started on March 1st, and by March 25th, the work is almost done. At that point, the homeowner suggests that the landscaper also do the backyard, on the same terms and conditions as the existing contract, and promises to pay $10,000 upon completion by May 1st. The landscaper agrees, they shake hands, and that's the agreement.\n\nNow, I need to determine the legal effect of the landscaper's promise to do the backyard work. The options are:\n\nA. Unilateral contract\n\nB. Bilateral contract\n\nC. Voidable contract because it's not in writing\n\nD. Illusory contract, therefore unenforceable\n\nAlright, let's recall what each of these means.\n\nA unilateral contract is one where one party makes a promise in exchange for the other party's performance. So, it's essentially a \"do this, and I'll do that\" kind of agreement.\n\nA bilateral contract, on the other hand, involves an exchange of promises between both parties. It's more of \"I promise to do this, and you promise to do that.\"\n\nA voidable contract is one that can be avoided or annulled by one of the parties, usually due to some defect like lack of capacity or fraud.\n\nAn illusory contract is one that isn't really a contract at all because one of the parties hasn't actually made a real promise. It's often used when a party reserves the right to cancel or not perform, making the agreement too vague or uncertain to be enforceable.\n\nGiven that, let's look back at the scenario.\n\nThe homeowner offers to pay $10,000 if the landscaper completes the backyard work by May 1st, on the same terms and conditions as the existing contract. The landscaper agrees and they shake hands.\n\nSo, the homeowner is making a promise to pay $10,000 upon completion by a certain date, and the landscaper is promising to do the work by that date.\n\nThis sounds like an exchange of promises: homeowner promises to pay if the landscaper promises to perform the work by a specific date.\n\nThat makes it sound like a bilateral contract, where both sides are making promises.\n\nBut wait, option A says it's a unilateral contract. Would that fit here? In a unilateral contract, typically, one party makes a promise in exchange for the other's act, not promise. So, if the homeowner had said, \"I'll pay you $10,000 when you finish the backyard,\" without specifying a date or agreeing to pay regardless of when it's finished, that might be more of a unilateral contract because payment is in exchange for completion, not necessarily a promise to complete by a certain date.\n\nBut in this case, the homeowner specifies that payment is contingent on completion by May 1st, and the landscaper agrees to that timeline. So, it's more of an exchange of promises: promise to pay by a certain date for the promise to complete by a certain date.\n\nSo, that seems more like a bilateral contract.\n\nOption C says it's voidable because it's not in writing. Well, generally, contracts don't have to be in writing to be enforceable, unless they fall under the Statute of Frauds, which requires certain contracts to be in writing. These include contracts that can't be performed within one year, contracts for the sale of land, and some others.\n\nIn this case, the contract is for landscaping services, which is typically a service contract. If the contract can be performed within one year, it doesn't need to be in writing. And since the work is to be completed by May 1st, which is within the same year, and presumably the payment is due upon completion, it's likely not required to be in writing under the Statute of Frauds.\n\nMoreover, even if it were required to be in writing, the fact that they shook hands and agreed verbally might still make it enforceable if there's partial performance or other exceptions apply. But generally, I don't think the lack of writing makes the contract voidable in this scenario.\n\nOption D says it's illusory and unenforceable. An illusory contract is one where one party hasn't really made a promise because their obligation is too vague or they reserve the right to not perform.\n\nIn this case, both parties have made clear promises: the homeowner to pay $10,000 upon completion by May 1st, and the landscaper to complete the work by May 1st. There doesn't seem to be any reservation of the right not to perform by either party. So, I don't think it's illusory.\n\nUnless there's something in the existing contract terms that makes it illusory, but the problem says \"on the same terms and conditions as the existing contract.\" Without knowing what those terms are, it's hard to say, but assuming it's a standard service contract, it's probably not illusory.\n\nSo, considering all this, the most likely answer is that the landscaper's promise created an enforceable bilateral contract.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is there any possibility that this could be considered a unilateral contract?\n\nLet me think about it differently. Maybe the homeowner is making an offer that can only be accepted by the landscaper's performance, not by a promise. But in the scenario, the landscaper explicitly says \"agreed\" and shakes hands, which sounds like acceptance and a promise to perform.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the homeowner is making a promise to pay upon completion, which could be seen as a unilateral contract where the landscaper's performance is the consideration.\n\nBut the fact that they agreed on a specific completion date suggests that both parties are making promises: the homeowner to pay by May 1st if the work is completed by then, and the landscaper to complete the work by May 1st.\n\nThis reciprocal exchange of promises points more towards a bilateral contract.\n\nMoreover, in many jurisdictions, service contracts like landscaping are typically bilateral, with both parties making promises regarding performance and payment.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B. The landscaper's promise created an enforceable bilateral contract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
