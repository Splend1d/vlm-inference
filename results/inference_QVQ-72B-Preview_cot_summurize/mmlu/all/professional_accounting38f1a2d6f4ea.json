                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. It's a bit complex with all these terms like revolving credit, compensating balance, and commitment fee. But I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, what's a revolving credit agreement? I think it's like a line of credit where the company can borrow up to a certain amount, in this case, $500,000, and pay interest only on the amount they actually borrow. Here, the company is borrowing $200,000 for one year.\n\nThe interest rate is 10% on the funds used. So, on $200,000, the interest would be $20,000 for the year.\n\nNext, there's a 15% compensating balance. I recall that a compensating balance is an amount that the borrower has to keep in their account at the bank, usually as a percentage of the loan amount. So, if the compensating balance is 15% of the $200,000 borrowed, that would be $30,000. But the problem says \"the compensating balance would not otherwise be maintained,\" which probably means that without this agreement, the company wouldn't have that money sitting in their account. So, this $30,000 is effectively tied up and can't be used for other purposes.\n\nAdditionally, there's a commitment fee of 1% on the unused amount of the credit line. The total credit line is $500,000, and they're borrowing $200,000, so the unused amount is $300,000. A 1% commitment fee on that would be $3,000.\n\nNow, to find the effective annual interest cost, I need to consider all the costs associated with the loan and divide by the actual funds available to the company.\n\nFirst, calculate the total cost:\n\n1. Interest on the loan: $200,000 * 10% = $20,000\n\n2. Compensating balance: $200,000 * 15% = $30,000 (but this is not a direct cost; it's money tied up.)\n\n3. Commitment fee: $300,000 * 1% = $3,000\n\nSo, the total direct costs are $20,000 + $3,000 = $23,000.\n\nBut, since $30,000 is tied up in the compensating balance, that affects the actual funds available to the company. The company borrows $200,000 but has to keep $30,000 in the account, so the net funds available are $200,000 - $30,000 = $170,000.\n\nWait, but the compensating balance is $30,000, which is 15% of $200,000. But actually, the compensating balance is typically a percentage of the total credit line or the amount borrowed. I need to make sure I understand how it's calculated.\n\nLet me double-check. The agreement calls for a 15% compensating balance, and it's probably based on the total credit line of $500,000, not just the amount borrowed. So, 15% of $500,000 is $75,000. But the problem says, \"assuming that the compensating balance would not otherwise be maintained,\" which suggests that the company has to keep $75,000 in their account, regardless of how much they borrow, as long as they have borrowed something under the $500,000 line.\n\nSo, the compensating balance is $75,000, which is 15% of the total credit line of $500,000.\n\nNow, this $75,000 is money that the company has to keep in their account and can't use for other purposes. So, when they borrow $200,000, they actually receive $200,000 but have to maintain $75,000 as compensating balance. Assuming they didn't have that $75,000 already in their account, they effectively receive only $200,000 - $75,000 = $125,000.\n\nWait a minute, that seems off. If they borrow $200,000 and have to keep $75,000 as compensating balance, but they might already have some money in their account. The problem says, \"assuming that the compensating balance would not otherwise be maintained,\" which probably means that without the loan, the company wouldn't have that $75,000 in the account. So, they need to deposit $75,000 into their account to meet the compensating balance requirement.\n\nTherefore, the net funds available to the company are the amount borrowed minus the compensating balance they need to deposit: $200,000 - $75,000 = $125,000.\n\nBut, they also have to pay interest of $20,000 on the $200,000 borrowed at 10%, and a commitment fee of $3,000 on the unused $300,000 at 1%.\n\nSo, total cost is $20,000 (interest) + $3,000 (commitment fee) = $23,000.\n\nNet funds available: $125,000.\n\nEffective interest rate would be total cost divided by net funds available, which is $23,000 / $125,000 = 0.184 or 18.4%.\n\nBut none of the options are close to that. The closest is 13.53%, but that's not matching. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me think again. Perhaps the compensating balance is calculated differently. If the compensating balance is 15% of the total credit line, which is $500,000, then yes, it's $75,000. But maybe it's 15% of the amount borrowed, which is $200,000 * 0.15 = $30,000.\n\nWait, the problem says \"a 15% compensating balance,\" but it doesn't specify whether it's based on the credit line or the amount borrowed. In many cases, it's based on the amount borrowed. So, perhaps it's $30,000.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nIf the compensating balance is $30,000, then the net funds available are $200,000 - $30,000 = $170,000.\n\nTotal cost is still $20,000 (interest) + $3,000 (commitment fee) = $23,000.\n\nEffective interest rate is $23,000 / $170,000 = approximately 13.53%.\n\nThat matches option D, 13.53%.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because the problem mentions a $500,000 revolving credit agreement, and sometimes compensating balances are based on the total credit line.\n\nLet me check a finance formula for effective interest rate in cases with compensating balances.\n\nThe formula for effective interest rate when there's a compensating balance is:\n\nEffective Interest Rate = (Interest Paid + Commitment Fee) / (Amount Borrowed - Compensating Balance)\n\nIn this case, assuming the compensating balance is based on the amount borrowed:\n\nCompensating Balance = 15% of $200,000 = $30,000\n\nAmount available = $200,000 - $30,000 = $170,000\n\nInterest = $200,000 * 10% = $20,000\n\nCommitment Fee = $300,000 * 1% = $3,000\n\nTotal Cost = $20,000 + $3,000 = $23,000\n\nEffective Interest Rate = $23,000 / $170,000 \u2248 13.53%\n\nThat seems to match option D.\n\nBut let's consider if the compensating balance is based on the total credit line.\n\nIf compensating balance is 15% of $500,000 = $75,000\n\nThen, amount available = $200,000 - $75,000 = $125,000\n\nTotal Cost = $20,000 (interest) + $3,000 (commitment fee) = $23,000\n\nEffective Interest Rate = $23,000 / $125,000 = 0.184 or 18.4%, which doesn't match any option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the compensating balance is based on the amount borrowed, which seems more common.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compensating balance is calculated differently.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the compensating balance is a requirement regardless of whether the company has that money already.\n\nThe problem says, \"assuming that the compensating balance would not otherwise be maintained,\" which means that without the loan, the company wouldn't have that $75,000 in their account. So, they need to deposit $75,000 into their account to meet the requirement.\n\nTherefore, the net funds available are $200,000 (borrowed) - $75,000 (compensating balance) = $125,000.\n\nBut this gives an effective interest rate of 18.4%, which isn't matching any option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the compensating balance is based on the amount borrowed, not the total credit line.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nIf compensating balance is 15% of $200,000 = $30,000\n\nThen, net funds available = $200,000 - $30,000 = $170,000\n\nTotal cost = $20,000 (interest) + $3,000 (commitment fee) = $23,000\n\nEffective interest rate = $23,000 / $170,000 \u2248 13.53%, which matches option D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the compensating balance as reducing the principal on which interest is paid.\n\nBut no, the interest is already calculated on the amount borrowed, $200,000 at 10%, which is $20,000.\n\nSo, I think the first approach is correct, with the compensating balance based on the amount borrowed.\n\nTherefore, the effective annual interest cost is approximately 13.53%, which corresponds to option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
