Tom Thumb.\" Hmm, okay, I need to think about this. It's been a while since I've read these stories.\n\nFirst off, I remember Chicken Little from somewhere. Wasn't she a little chicken who thought the sky was falling because an acorn fell on her head or something like that? Let me see, yeah, I think that's the one. So, option A seems plausible.\n\nNow, Curious George\u2014I know he's the monkey who's always getting into trouble because he's so curious. He's always exploring and stuff. I don't recall him thinking the sky is falling. Maybe he climbs trees or something, but not really about the sky falling. So, probably not him.\n\nJack Sprat\u2014that name rings a bell. There's a nursery rhyme about Jack Sprat could eat no fat, and his wife could eat no lean. Something like that. That doesn't sound like a story where the sky is falling. Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't think so.\n\nTom Thumb\u2014that's another nursery rhyme character, right? He's like a tiny person, isn't he? I think he gets into all sorts of adventures because of his size. Again, nothing comes to mind about the sky falling.\n\nSo, based on what I recall, Chicken Little is the one who thinks the sky is falling. The other characters seem to have different themes in their stories.\n\nWait a minute, just to make sure, maybe I should double-check. Maybe there's a connection between the other characters and the idea of the sky falling that I'm not remembering.\n\nLet me think about Curious George again. In his stories, he often learns about the world around him through his adventures. Maybe there's a part where he thinks something is happening to the sky, but I really don't remember that specific theme in his stories.\n\nJack Sprat and Tom Thumb\u2014are more about their eating habits and size respectively. I can't recall any plot points where they worry about the sky falling.\n\nChicken Little, on the other hand, is specifically about a character who misinterprets a small event, like an acorn falling, as a sign that the sky is falling. It's a story about not panicking and checking facts before jumping to conclusions.\n\nYeah, I think the answer is A. Chicken Little.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Chicken Little}} \\]"
