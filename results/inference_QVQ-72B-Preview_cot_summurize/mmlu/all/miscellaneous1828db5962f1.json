                    "text": "So I've got this question about different types of opera: ballad opera, opera buffa, and op\u00e9ra comique. The question is asking which feature they all share from a list of options. The options are:\n\nA. They contained da capo arias\n\nB. They began with a French overture.\n\nC. They focused on everyday problems.\n\nD. They contained obbligato recitative.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to look at each type of opera and see which of these features they all have in common.\n\nFirst up, ballad opera. I remember that ballad opera is a genre that originated in Britain in the early 18th century. It's known for using popular tunes and folk songs, often with spoken dialogue instead of recitative. So, it's a bit like operetta, I guess. But does it have da capo arias? Da capo arias are those A-B-A form arias where the singer has a big aria that starts, goes to a contrast, and then repeats the first part. I think ballad operas tended to use simpler song forms, maybe more strophic forms where each verse uses the same melody. So, probably not da capo arias. That might eliminate option A.\n\nNext, opera buffa. This is Italian comic opera, right? It started in the early 18th century as well, around the same time as ballad opera. Opera buffa is known for its light-hearted plots, often involving servants outwitting their masters, and it uses everyday language and situations. As for the music, I recall that it often includes ensemble numbers and fast-paced dialogue. But does it have da capo arias? Well, in the early days of opera buffa, da capo arias were common in opera seria, the more serious form of opera, but opera buffa tended to use simpler, more direct musical forms. So, again, probably not da capo arias. Maybe option A is out.\n\nNow, op\u00e9ra comique. This is the French version of comic opera, developing in the 18th century. It's similar to opera buffa in that it's lighter in tone and deals with everyday life. It usually has spoken dialogue interspersed with musical numbers, which can be arias, ensembles, or choruses. Interesting. So, does op\u00e9ra comique have da capo arias? Again, I think not typically. French opera seemed to favor different structures, maybe more through-composed arias or simpler forms. So, maybe option A isn't a shared feature among these three opera types.\n\nOption B: they began with a French overture. A French overture is a specific type of overture that was popular in Baroque opera, characterized by a slow introduction with dotted rhythms followed by a faster section. It was commonly used in French opera, particularly in the works of Lully and Rameau. But, was this overture style used in ballad opera and opera buffa? Ballad opera, being British, probably didn't use the French overture style. Opera buffa is Italian and might have had its own overture styles, like the Italian sinfonia. So, probably not a shared feature among these three.\n\nOption C: they focused on everyday problems. This seems plausible. Ballad opera was known for its use of everyday language and situations. Opera buffa dealt with comic, often domestic, plots involving common people. Op\u00e9ra comique also focused on everyday life and comic situations. So, all three seem to emphasize everyday problems and comedic elements. This could be the answer.\n\nOption D: they contained obbligato recitative. Recitative is a singing style that advances the plot, often used in operas to deliver dialogue quickly. Obbligato recitative is when the recitative is accompanied by instruments playing independent lines, adding to the musical texture. Did all three of these opera types use obbligato recitative? Ballad opera, as I recall, used spoken dialogue rather than recitative. Opera buffa used secco recitative, which is just voice with basso continuo, not obbligato. Op\u00e9ra comique had spoken dialogue, so probably not much recitative at all. Therefore, obbligato recitative doesn't seem to be a shared feature.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option C seems to be the correct answer. All three opera types\u2014ballad opera, opera buffa, and op\u00e9ra comique\u2014focused on everyday problems.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
