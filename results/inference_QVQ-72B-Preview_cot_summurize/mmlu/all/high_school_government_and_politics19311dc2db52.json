                    "text": "So I have this question about federal judges, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that they serve four-year terms that coincide with the presidential term. Hmm, I thought federal judges served for life, not just four years. I remember something about them having lifetime appointments to ensure their independence from political pressure. So, this probably isn't correct.\n\nOption B says they are appointed for life and can only be removed by impeachment. That sounds familiar. I think federal judges do have lifetime tenure, and they can be removed through impeachment if they engage in misconduct. But is that the only way they can be removed?\n\nOption C states that they are elected by Congress and serve ten-year terms. Wait, I thought federal judges were appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, not elected directly by Congress. Also, ten-year terms seem short for federal judges; I thought their positions were lifetime appointments to maintain judicial independence.\n\nOption D says they are appointed for life and cannot be removed from office. This seems similar to Option B but goes a step further by saying they cannot be removed at all. But I recall that while federal judges have lifetime tenure, they can be impeached and removed for misconduct. So, this seems incomplete.\n\nLet me summarize what I know:\n\n- Federal judges are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.\n\n- They serve for life, which is meant to protect them from external pressures and ensure they can make decisions based on law without fear of losing their jobs.\n\n- However, they can be impeached and removed from office for misconduct.\n\nGiven this, Option B seems to be the most accurate because it says they are appointed for life and can only be removed by impeachment. Option D is incorrect because it says they cannot be removed at all, but in reality, impeachment is a possible way to remove them from office.\n\nWait a minute, is impeachment the only way to remove a federal judge? I think there might be other processes, like disability retirement or voluntary resignation, but in terms of involuntary removal, impeachment is the primary process.\n\nLet me double-check this. I believe that according to the U.S. Constitution, federal judges can be removed through impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate. Additionally, they can be disciplined by the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act, but that doesn't result in removal from office; it's more about addressing misconduct or disability issues short of impeachment.\n\nSo, in practice, impeachment is indeed the primary mechanism for removing a federal judge from office against their will.\n\nTherefore, Option B is correct: they are appointed for life and can only be removed by impeachment.\n\nJust to make sure, let's look back at the other options:\n\n- Option A: Federal judges do not serve four-year terms; they have lifetime appointments.\n\n- Option C: They are not elected by Congress; they are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.\n\n- Option D: They can be removed through impeachment.\n\nSo, yeah, Option B is the correct statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
