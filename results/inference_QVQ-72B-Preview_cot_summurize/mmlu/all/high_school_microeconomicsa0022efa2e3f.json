                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about production and returns to scale. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nWe have capital fixed at one unit, and we're adding labor in units of 1, 2, and 3, with corresponding outputs of 300, 350, and 375. So, it's a situation where only labor is being increased while capital remains constant.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the concepts of returns to scale and marginal productivity, especially in the context of the short run and long run.\n\nReturns to scale usually refer to what happens when all inputs are increased proportionally. In the long run, we can adjust all inputs, whereas in the short run, some inputs are fixed.\n\nHere, since capital is fixed, this seems like a short-run scenario because we're not changing all inputs proportionally.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. This is long run increasing returns to scale.\n\nB. This is long run decreasing returns to scale.\n\nC. This is long run constant returns to scale.\n\nD. This is short run diminishing marginal productivity.\n\nOkay, so options A, B, and C are about long-run returns to scale, which involves changing all inputs proportionally. But in this case, capital is fixed, so it's not a long-run scenario; it's more of a short-run situation where only labor is being varied.\n\nSo, options A, B, and C might not be directly applicable here because they pertain to long-run scenarios where all inputs are variable.\n\nOption D mentions short-run diminishing marginal productivity. That sounds more relevant because we have a fixed input (capital) and a variable input (labor).\n\nLet me think about marginal productivity. Marginal product is the additional output obtained by adding one more unit of labor, holding capital constant.\n\nSo, with 1 unit of labor, output is 300.\n\nWith 2 units of labor, output is 350. So, the marginal product of the second unit is 350 - 300 = 50.\n\nWith 3 units of labor, output is 375. So, the marginal product of the third unit is 375 - 350 = 25.\n\nSo, as labor increases from 1 to 2 to 3 units, the marginal product decreases from 50 to 25.\n\nThis suggests that each additional unit of labor is adding less to the total output than the previous unit.\n\nThis is a classic example of diminishing marginal productivity, which is a short-run phenomenon where one input is increased while others are held constant.\n\nSo, based on this, option D seems to be the correct interpretation.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there could be any other interpretations.\n\nCould this be considered a long-run scenario? Well, in the long run, we can vary all inputs, but here capital is fixed, so it's not a long-run situation.\n\nOptions A, B, and C all refer to long-run returns to scale, which aren't applicable here because we're not changing all inputs proportionally.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D: short run diminishing marginal productivity.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
