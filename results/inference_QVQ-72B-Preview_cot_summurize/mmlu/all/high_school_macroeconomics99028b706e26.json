                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of the following is equal to one? A. The elasticity of the long-run aggregate supply curve, B. The spending (or expenditure) multiplier, C. The money (or banking) multiplier, D. The balanced budget multiplier.\" Hmm, I need to recall what each of these terms means and see which one equals one.\n\nStarting with option A, the elasticity of the long-run aggregate supply curve. I remember that in macroeconomics, the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve is vertical at the potential output level. That means it's perfectly inelastic, right? So, its elasticity is zero, not one. So, probably not the answer.\n\nNext, option B: the spending or expenditure multiplier. I think this is related to the multiplier effect in Keynesian economics. It's about how an initial increase in spending leads to a larger increase in national income. The formula for the spending multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC), where MPC is the marginal propensity to consume. Unless MPC is zero, the multiplier is greater than one. But in reality, MPC is usually between zero and one, so the multiplier is typically greater than one. So, it's unlikely to be equal to one.\n\nOption C: the money (or banking) multiplier. This is from monetary economics. It's the factor by which the money supply increases when the central bank injects new reserves into the banking system. The formula is 1/reserve requirement ratio. If the reserve requirement is, say, 10%, the multiplier is 10. So, unless the reserve requirement is 100%, the multiplier isn't one. Maybe in some specific cases, but generally, it's different from one.\n\nLastly, option D: the balanced budget multiplier. This one I'm not as familiar with, but I think it has to do with changes in government spending and taxes. Let me think... If the government increases both spending and taxes by the same amount, what's the effect on national income? In the Keynesian cross model, an increase in government spending increases income, but an increase in taxes decreases disposable income and thus consumption. If they're equal, do they offset each other?\n\nWait, but the balanced budget multiplier suggests that even if spending and taxes are increased by the same amount, national income still increases by the amount of the increase in government spending. So, if the government spends an extra $1 and taxes an extra $1, income rises by $1. That sounds like a multiplier of one because the change in income equals the change in government spending, regardless of the tax increase.\n\nLet me double-check that. Suppose the marginal propensity to consume is MPC. The typical multiplier formula is 1/(1 - MPC). If we have a balanced budget change, where government spending and taxes both increase by \u0394G, the change in income (\u0394Y) is \u0394G multiplied by the balanced budget multiplier.\n\nI recall that in the Keynesian model, the balanced budget multiplier is equal to one. That is, \u0394Y = \u0394G, regardless of the value of MPC. So, in that case, the multiplier is indeed one.\n\nTo make sure, let's consider an example. Suppose MPC is 0.8. The regular spending multiplier would be 1/(1 - 0.8) = 5. So, if government spending increases by $1, income increases by $5. But if we have a balanced budget increase of $1 (spending up by $1 and taxes up by $1), the increase in income is just $1. So, the multiplier is one.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Therefore, the balanced budget multiplier is equal to one.\n\nGoing back to the other options: LRAS elasticity is zero, spending multiplier is greater than one, money multiplier can vary depending on reserve requirements, but the balanced budget multiplier is specifically one.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. The balanced budget multiplier.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
