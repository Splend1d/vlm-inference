                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to find 1 over 6 plus 1 over 8. Hmm, fractions addition. I remember that to add fractions, I need a common denominator. So, first things first, I need to find a common denominator for 6 and 8.\n\nLet me think about the denominators. Denominator of 6 and denominator of 8. What's the least common multiple (LCM) of these two numbers? That would be the smallest number that both 6 and 8 divide into without leaving a remainder.\n\nLet's list the multiples of each:\n\nMultiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36,...\n\nMultiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40,...\n\nLooking at these lists, the smallest common multiple is 24. So, 24 will be my common denominator.\n\nNow, I need to convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 24.\n\nStarting with 1 over 6:\n\nI need to find what number, when multiplied by 6, gives me 24. Oh, 6 times 4 is 24. So, I multiply the numerator by 4 as well. 1 times 4 is 4. So, 1 over 6 is equal to 4 over 24.\n\nNext, 1 over 8:\n\nWhat times 8 equals 24? 8 times 3 is 24. So, I multiply the numerator by 3. 1 times 3 is 3. So, 1 over 8 is equal to 3 over 24.\n\nNow, I can add these two fractions together since they have the same denominator:\n\n4 over 24 plus 3 over 24 equals 7 over 24.\n\nSo, 1 over 6 plus 1 over 8 equals 7 over 24.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 7 over 24\n\nB. 2 over 14\n\nC. 1 over 7\n\nD. 1 over 4\n\nIt seems like option A is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for adding two fractions: a/b + c/d = (a*d + b*c) / (b*d).\n\nSo, applying that:\n\n1/6 + 1/8 = (1*8 + 1*6) / (6*8) = (8 + 6) / 48 = 14 / 48.\n\nCan I simplify 14 over 48? Let's see, both 14 and 48 are divisible by 2.\n\n14 divided by 2 is 7, and 48 divided by 2 is 24, so 7 over 24 again.\n\nYes, that matches option A.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way this could be interpreted? Maybe using decimals or something, but no, it's straightforward fraction addition.\n\nI think I'm confident with the answer.\n\nSo, the correct choice is A. 7 over 24.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\dfrac{7}{24}} \\]"
