                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this case about a 14-year-old girl who's been exhibiting some concerning behavior recently. Her mother brought her to the doctor because she found out that the girl has been having sex with multiple partners and isn't using any protection like condoms or other forms of contraception. The mother is really worried about her daughter's behavior.\n\nBackground-wise, the parents got separated three months ago. Before that, the girl was doing really well in school\u2014she was an honor student, involved in sports, and held leadership positions. But since the separation, there's been a noticeable change in her behavior. She's become moody, defiant, and rebellious. She's started smoking, ignoring her curfew, and skipping school.\n\nSo, the question is asking about the defense mechanism she's most likely using. Defense mechanisms are ways the mind protects itself from anxiety or uncomfortable thoughts and feelings. There are several options here: acting out, displacement, projection, and reaction formation.\n\nLet me try to understand each one:\n\nA. Acting out: This seems like behaving in a way that expresses feelings or impulses instead of dealing with them mentally. It's kind of like turning internal conflicts into external actions.\n\nB. Displacement: This is when someone takes feelings meant for one person or situation and redirects them to a different, safer target. Like, if you're angry at your boss, but you come home and yell at your dog.\n\nC. Projection: This is where you attribute your own unacceptable thoughts or feelings to someone else. For example, if you're feeling insecure about your own behavior, you might accuse someone else of doing the same thing.\n\nD. Reaction formation: This is when you express the opposite of what you're really feeling to deal with anxiety about those feelings. So, if you're attracted to someone, you might act extra hostile towards them to cover it up.\n\nNow, looking back at the girl's situation, let's see which one fits best.\n\nShe's been through a significant life change with her parents' separation. That's a big deal, especially at 14. It's likely causing her a lot of emotional distress, even if she's not expressing it directly.\n\nBefore the separation, she was doing well in school, involved in positive activities. After the separation, she starts acting out in various ways: having unprotected sex with multiple partners, smoking, disobeying rules, and being truant.\n\nLet's consider acting out. It seems like her behaviors\u2014sexuality, rule-breaking, etc.\u2014could be ways she's expressing her internal turmoil externally. Maybe she's feeling lost, angry, or hurt about the separation, and instead of talking about it, she's acting in ways that are self-destructive.\n\nDisplacement might involve her directing her feelings about the separation towards other people or situations that are safer or less threatening. For example, maybe she's angry at her parents but expresses that anger by being mean to friends or teachers.\n\nProjection could be if she's feeling guilty or insecure about her own behavior and starts accusing others of doing the same things. Like, maybe she's having multiple sexual partners and feels bad about it, so she might accuse her friends of being promiscuous.\n\nReaction formation would be if she's feeling one way but acts the opposite to deal with her anxiety. For example, if she's feeling vulnerable and needs support, she might act extra rebellious and independent to mask those feelings.\n\nHmm, let's think about this more carefully.\n\nShe's engaging in risky behaviors that could be harmful to her, like unprotected sex and smoking. These actions seem more aligned with acting out\u2014expressing her internal conflicts through behavior rather than dealing with them mentally.\n\nDisplacement might involve her\u8f6c\u79fbing her emotions to safer targets, but in this case, her actions seem directly related to her own sense of control or rebellion, perhaps against her parents or the situation.\n\nProjection might be if she's denying her own behavior and blaming others for it, but there's no clear indication that she's doing that yet.\n\nReaction formation would involve her expressing the opposite of her true feelings, which might be possible, but it's not as clearly evident as acting out.\n\nConsidering all this, I think acting out is the most fitting defense mechanism here. Her behaviors seem to be a direct expression of her internal distress and a way to cope with the changes in her life.\n\nI should also consider that multiple defense mechanisms could be at play, but for the purpose of this question, probably one is more prominent.\n\nSo, my answer is A. Acting out.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
