                    "text": "Let's dive into this real estate contract problem. So, there's a seller who agreed to sell a piece of land to a buyer for $300,000. The contract says the closing is 60 days after signing and that the seller will give the buyer a \"marketable title\" via a quitclaim deed at closing. But that's all it says about the title. Now, a title search turned up two things: an unsatisfied $50,000 mortgage and a right-of-way easement on part of the land. The buyer is saying the title isn't marketable and refuses to close. The question is, is the buyer correct?\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a \"marketable title\" means. From what I recall, a marketable title is one that's free from any defects or disputes that would make it unsafe for the buyer to proceed with the purchase. It should assure the buyer that they're getting clear ownership of the property without any legal hangups.\n\nNow, the contract says the seller will convey a marketable title by a quitclaim deed. A quitclaim deed is interesting because it transfers whatever interest the grantor has in the property but doesn't guarantee that the grantor actually owns the property or that there are no liens or encumbrances on it. So, typically, quitclaim deeds aren't associated with marketable titles, which require clearer assurance of ownership.\n\nBut in this case, the contract specifically mentions a marketable title via a quitclaim deed. Maybe the parties agreed to this arrangement, but the buyer is now balking at the encumbrances found in the title search.\n\nLet's look at the encumbrances: an unsatisfied $50,000 mortgage and a right-of-way easement.\n\nStarting with the mortgage: If there's an outstanding mortgage on the property, that means someone else has a claim to the property as security for a debt. Unless this mortgage is satisfied or assumed by the buyer, it could be a problem because the buyer wouldn't have clear title. The lender could foreclose on the property if the debt isn't paid, which puts the buyer at risk.\n\nAs for the right-of-way easement, this is a right for someone else to use a part of the property for a specific purpose, like access to a public road or utilities. Easements can affect the use and value of the property, so they're something a buyer would need to be aware of and accept.\n\nNow, the buyer is claiming the title is unmarketable due to these issues and is refusing to close. The question is whether the buyer is correct in asserting that the title is unmarketable.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. No, because nothing under these facts renders title unmarketable.\n\nB. No, because the buyer agreed to accept a quitclaim deed.\n\nC. Yes, because the right-of-way easement makes the title unmarketable.\n\nD. Yes, because the unsatisfied mortgage makes the title unmarketable.\n\nI need to determine which of these statements is accurate.\n\nFirst, option A says nothing here makes the title unmarketable. But that seems too broad. Both a mortgage and an easement are encumbrances on the title, which could affect its marketability.\n\nOption B says no because the buyer agreed to accept a quitclaim deed. But quitclaim deeds typically don't guarantee a clear title; they just transfer whatever interest the grantor has. However, the contract here specifies a \"marketable title\" via a quitclaim deed. So, even though it's a quitclaim deed, the seller is still obligated to provide a marketable title. So, this option might not be correct.\n\nOption C says yes because the right-of-way easement makes the title unmarketable. Easements can indeed affect the marketability of a title, especially if they significantly impact the use or value of the property. However, not all easements necessarily render a title unmarketable, depending on local law and the specific circumstances.\n\nOption D says yes because the unsatisfied mortgage makes the title unmarketable. An unsatisfied mortgage is a serious encumbrance because it represents a claim against the property that could lead to foreclosure if not paid. This seems like a significant defect in the title that would make it unmarketable.\n\nBut wait, maybe both the mortgage and the easement could affect marketability. However, the question seems to suggest that one of them is the primary issue.\n\nLet me think about this differently. In many jurisdictions, a marketable title must be free from any lien or encumbrance that would affect the buyer's use or ownership of the property. An unsatisfied mortgage is certainly a lien that could affect the property, as it gives a third party (the lender) the right to foreclose if the debt isn't satisfied.\n\nOn the other hand, a right-of-way easement might not necessarily make the title unmarketable, depending on its nature and the impact on the property's use. Some easements are common and accepted, like utility easements or easements for access roads.\n\nTherefore, the unsatisfied mortgage seems to be the more significant issue here, potentially rendering the title unmarketable.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any possibility that the quitclaim deed could address these issues. Quitclaim deeds don't provide any warranty of title, so the seller isn't promising that there are no liens or encumbrances. However, the contract specifically mentions a \"marketable title,\" which suggests that the seller is obligated to provide a title that's free from defects.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the buyer thought that a quitclaim deed means they're accepting the title \"as is,\" but the contract still requires a marketable title.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the seller intended to satisfy the mortgage before closing, but for some reason, that hasn't happened yet.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether the contract has any provisions for adjusting the purchase price based on title defects or for the buyer to assume certain liens. But the problem states that the contract only includes the closing date and the type of deed.\n\nGiven that, and considering that an unsatisfied mortgage is a significant lien on the property, it seems reasonable to conclude that the title is unmarketable due to this defect.\n\nTherefore, the buyer is correct in refusing to close, at least until the mortgage is satisfied or otherwise addressed.\n\nSo, the answer should be D: Yes, because the unsatisfied mortgage makes the title unmarketable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
