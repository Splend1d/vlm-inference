                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: A stone is thrown horizontally with an initial speed of 10 m/s from a bridge, and I need to find out how long it will take the stone to strike the water, which is 80 meters below the bridge. The problem says to assume that air resistance is negligible, so I can ignore that.\n\nAlright, first things first, since the stone is thrown horizontally, its initial velocity in the vertical direction is zero. So, in the vertical direction, it's basically in free fall, right? The only acceleration acting on it is due to gravity, which is downward.\n\nI remember that the equation for free fall is:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( h \\) is the height, which is 80 meters,\n\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity, which is approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2 downward,\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time in seconds.\n\nSo, I can plug in the values I have into this equation and solve for \\( t \\).\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n\\[ 80 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\times t^2 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 = 4.9 \\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 80 = 4.9 \\times t^2 \\]\n\nNow, to solve for \\( t^2 \\), I'll divide both sides by 4.9:\n\n\\[ t^2 = \\frac{80}{4.9} \\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{80}{4.9} \\approx 16.3265 \\]\n\nSo, \\( t^2 \\approx 16.3265 \\)\n\nNow, to find \\( t \\), I need to take the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[ t = \\sqrt{16.3265} \\]\n\nCalculating the square root:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{16.3265} \\approx 4.04 \\] seconds\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1 s\n\nB. 2 s\n\nC. 4 s\n\nD. 8 s\n\nSo, 4 s seems pretty close to my calculation.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the equation:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\]\n\nPlugging in \\( h = 80 \\) m and \\( g = 9.8 \\) m/s\u00b2:\n\n\\[ 80 = 4.9 t^2 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ t^2 = \\frac{80}{4.9} \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{80}{4.9} = 16.3265... \\]\n\nTaking square roots:\n\n\\[ t = \\sqrt{16.3265...} \\approx 4.04 \\] seconds\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use more decimal places for accuracy. Let's try using \\( g = 9.80665 \\) m/s\u00b2, which is a more precise value for gravity.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.80665 \\times t^2 \\]\n\n\\[ 80 = 4.903325 \\times t^2 \\]\n\n\\[ t^2 = \\frac{80}{4.903325} \\approx 16.316 \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\sqrt{16.316} \\approx 4.039 \\] seconds\n\nStill approximately 4 seconds. So, option C. 4 s seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the horizontal velocity. But since the horizontal motion and vertical motion are independent, and the question is only about the time to hit the water, which is determined by the vertical displacement and acceleration due to gravity, the horizontal velocity shouldn't affect the time of fall.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of the stone's vertical position as a function of time.\n\nStarting from rest in the vertical direction, the vertical position \\( y \\) as a function of time is:\n\n\\[ y = y_0 + v_{0y} t + \\frac{1}{2} a_y t^2 \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( y_0 = 0 \\) (assuming the water level is y=0)\n\n- \\( v_{0y} = 0 \\) (initial vertical velocity is zero)\n\n- \\( a_y = -g \\) (acceleration due to gravity downward)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 0 = 0 + 0 \\times t + \\frac{1}{2} \\times (-9.8) \\times t^2 \\]\n\n\\[ 0 = -4.9 t^2 \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the stone is starting at a height of 80 meters. Maybe I need to set the initial position correctly.\n\nLet me redefine:\n\nLet\u2019s set the initial position (bridge) at y = 0, and the water is at y = -80 m.\n\nThen, the vertical position equation should be:\n\n\\[ y = y_0 + v_{0y} t + \\frac{1}{2} a_y t^2 \\]\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\[ -80 = 0 + 0 \\times t + \\frac{1}{2} \\times (-9.8) \\times t^2 \\]\n\n\\[ -80 = -4.9 t^2 \\]\n\nNow, solving for \\( t^2 \\):\n\n\\[ t^2 = \\frac{80}{4.9} \\approx 16.3265 \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\sqrt{16.3265} \\approx 4.04 \\] seconds\n\nOkay, this matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider significant figures, the initial speed is given as 10 m/s, which seems to have one significant figure, but it's likely that the '10' implies two significant figures (10 m/s). The height is 80 m, which again seems to have one significant figure, but probably two (80 m). So, perhaps I should round my answer to two significant figures, which would be 4.0 s, matching option C.\n\nMoreover, considering the options provided:\n\nA. 1 s\n\nB. 2 s\n\nC. 4 s\n\nD. 8 s\n\n4 s seems the most reasonable answer based on the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the problem differently. Suppose the stone is in free fall from rest; how long would it take to fall 80 meters?\n\nUsing the free fall equation again:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\]\n\n\\[ 80 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\times t^2 \\]\n\n\\[ t^2 = \\frac{160}{9.8} \\approx 16.3265 \\]\n\n\\[ t \\approx 4.04 \\] s\n\nSame result again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for time of flight in projectile motion. In projectile motion, the time of flight is given by:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{2 v_{0y}}{g} \\]\n\nBut in this case, the initial vertical velocity \\( v_{0y} \\) is zero, so this formula would give t = 0, which doesn't make sense because the stone is only moving horizontally initially and falling vertically due to gravity.\n\nWait, no, in projectile motion, when the initial vertical velocity is zero, the time of flight is determined solely by the vertical displacement and gravity, which is what I've been calculating.\n\nSo, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use energy conservation. The potential energy at the bridge turns into kinetic energy when the stone hits the water.\n\nInitial potential energy:\n\n\\[ PE = m g h = m \\times 9.8 \\times 80 \\]\n\nFinal kinetic energy:\n\n\\[ KE = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\]\n\nBy conservation of energy:\n\n\\[ m g h = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\]\n\n\\[ v^2 = 2 g h \\]\n\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{2 g h} \\]\n\nBut I don't know the final velocity yet; I need the time. Maybe this isn't the most direct way.\n\nAlternatively, relating velocity and time:\n\n\\[ v = u + a t \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( v \\) is the final velocity,\n\n- \\( u \\) is the initial velocity (0 m/s vertically),\n\n- \\( a \\) is the acceleration due to gravity (-9.8 m/s\u00b2),\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ v = 0 + (-9.8) t \\]\n\n\\[ v = -9.8 t \\]\n\nAlso, displacement:\n\n\\[ s = u t + \\frac{1}{2} a t^2 \\]\n\n\\[ -80 = 0 \\times t + \\frac{1}{2} \\times (-9.8) \\times t^2 \\]\n\n\\[ -80 = -4.9 t^2 \\]\n\n\\[ t^2 = \\frac{80}{4.9} \\approx 16.3265 \\]\n\n\\[ t \\approx 4.04 \\] s\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula that relates displacement, initial velocity, and acceleration:\n\n\\[ s = s_0 + v_0 t + \\frac{1}{2} a t^2 \\]\n\nWhich is what I've been using.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula:\n\n\\[ v^2 = u^2 + 2 a s \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( v \\) is the final velocity,\n\n- \\( u \\) is the initial velocity (0 m/s),\n\n- \\( a \\) is the acceleration (-9.8 m/s\u00b2),\n\n- \\( s \\) is the displacement (-80 m).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ v^2 = 0 + 2 \\times (-9.8) \\times (-80) \\]\n\n\\[ v^2 = 2 \\times 9.8 \\times 80 \\]\n\n\\[ v^2 = 1568 \\]\n\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{1568} \\approx 39.6 \\] m/s\n\nBut again, this is the final vertical velocity, not the time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can relate this to the time using:\n\n\\[ v = u + a t \\]\n\n\\[ 39.6 = 0 + (-9.8) t \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{39.6}{9.8} \\approx 4.04 \\] s\n\nPerfect, this matches my previous calculations.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I always end up with approximately 4 seconds for the time of fall.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 4 s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
