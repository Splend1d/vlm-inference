                    "text": "So I have this question about hypothyroidism. Let's see what it's asking. The question is: \"Which of the following is true of hypothyroidism?\" And the options are:\n\nA. Weight loss\n\nB. Pre-tibial myxoedema\n\nC. A raised TSH level\n\nD. An aversion to warm places\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall what hypothyroidism is. Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormones, right? Thyroid hormones are important for regulating metabolism and many other bodily functions. So, if there's not enough of these hormones, it can cause a range of symptoms.\n\nLet's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Weight loss. Hmm, I thought that in hypothyroidism, metabolism slows down because there's not enough thyroid hormone. So, wouldn't that lead to weight gain rather than weight loss? Let me double-check that. Yes, I think weight gain is a common symptom of hypothyroidism because the metabolism is slowed down, making it easier to gain weight even if diet and exercise habits haven't changed. So, weight loss doesn't seem to align with that.\n\nOption B: Pre-tibial myxoedema. I'm not entirely sure about this one. Let me try to remember what pre-tibial myxoedema is. I think it's a skin condition associated with thyroid disorders, particularly Graves' disease, which is a type of hyperthyroidism. So, if hypothyroidism is the opposite of hyperthyroidism, meaning the thyroid is underactive rather than overactive, then pre-tibial myxoedema might not be directly associated with hypothyroidism. But I should make sure about that.\n\nOption C: A raised TSH level. TSH stands for thyroid-stimulating hormone, which is produced by the pituitary gland. It stimulates the thyroid to produce thyroid hormones. Now, in hypothyroidism, since there's not enough thyroid hormones, the pituitary gland is stimulated to produce more TSH in an attempt to compensate. So, TSH levels would be higher than normal in primary hypothyroidism. That makes sense. So, this seems like a correct option.\n\nOption D: An aversion to warm places. Okay, so hypothyroidism is known for causing a decrease in metabolic rate, which can lead to feeling cold more easily. People with hypothyroidism often report being colder than usual, even in warm environments. So, if they have an aversion to warm places, that might contradict what we know about hypothyroidism. It seems more likely that they would prefer warmer places to feel comfortable.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option C seems to be the correct answer. A raised TSH level is indeed a characteristic of hypothyroidism, as the body tries to stimulate the thyroid to produce more hormones.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me summarize why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Weight loss: Actually, weight gain is more common in hypothyroidism due to decreased metabolism.\n\nB. Pre-tibial myxoedema: This is more associated with hyperthyroidism, especially Graves' disease, not hypothyroidism.\n\nD. An aversion to warm places: People with hypothyroidism often feel cold and may prefer warmer environments.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. A raised TSH level.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
