                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about the pH of two lakes. Lake A has a pH of 8.0, and Lake B has a pH of 6.0. I need to figure out which statement is correct based on these measurements. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nFirst, option A says that Lake B is alkaline. I remember that pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a solution is. The scale goes from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Anything above 7 is alkaline, and anything below 7 is acidic. So, Lake B has a pH of 6.0, which is below 7, meaning it's acidic, not alkaline. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nNext, option B says that Lake B is 100 times more alkaline than Lake A. Well, since Lake B is actually acidic and Lake A is alkaline, this doesn't make sense. Lake A has a pH of 8.0, which is above 7, so it's alkaline, while Lake B has a pH of 6.0, which is acidic. So, Lake B isn't more alkaline than Lake A; in fact, it's acidic. This means option B is also incorrect.\n\nMoving on to option C: it states that the hydrogen ion concentration of Lake B is 104 M. Hmm, let's see how to calculate hydrogen ion concentration from pH. The formula is [H+] = 10^{-pH}. So for Lake B, [H+] = 10^{-6.0} M. Let me calculate that. 10 to the power of -6 is 1 x 10^{-6} M, which is 0.000001 M. But option C says 104 M, which doesn't match. Maybe it's a typo or something, but based on the information given, option C is incorrect.\n\nFinally, option D says that the pH of both lakes will decrease in response to acid rain. Acid rain is caused by pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere, which react with water vapor to form acidic precipitation. So, if acid rain falls into a lake, it will add more acid to the lake, which should make the lake more acidic, meaning the pH would decrease. Both Lake A and Lake B would be affected similarly, so their pH would decrease. Therefore, option D seems correct.\n\nLet me double-check. Lake A has a pH of 8.0 (alkaline), and Lake B has a pH of 6.0 (acidic). Acid rain would add more acid to both lakes. For Lake A, adding acid would neutralize some of its alkalinity, so its pH would decrease. For Lake B, adding acid would make it even more acidic, so its pH would also decrease. So, yes, both lakes' pH would decrease due to acid rain.\n\nI think option D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
