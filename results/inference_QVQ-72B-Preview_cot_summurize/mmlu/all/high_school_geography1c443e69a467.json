An attack by another country\n\nD. A charismatic national leader\n\nAnd the question is asking which of these is a centrifugal force.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a centrifugal force is in the context of a country. Centrifugal forces are factors that tend to pull a country apart, causing divisions or conflicts among its people. On the other hand, centripetal forces are those that bind a country together, fostering unity and cohesion.\n\nSo, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Religious differences.\n\nI know that in many countries, religious differences can lead to tensions and conflicts. For example, if there are multiple religious groups with different beliefs and practices, there might be disagreements over policies, social issues, or even cultural expressions. In extreme cases, these differences can lead to sectarian violence or demands for separate political entities. So, religious differences seem like they could be a centrifugal force.\n\nOption B: A national holiday.\n\nA national holiday is usually a day celebrated by the entire country, often to commemorate a significant event or person in the nation's history. These holidays are typically meant to bring people together, fostering a sense of national pride and unity. For instance, Independence Day in the United States is a national holiday that celebrates the country's freedom and founding principles, uniting citizens in celebration. So, a national holiday seems more like a centripetal force, something that brings people together rather than dividing them.\n\nOption C: An attack by another country.\n\nWhen a country is attacked by an external enemy, it often leads to a rally-around-the-flag effect, where citizens unite in response to the common threat. This kind of external pressure usually strengthens national unity as people put aside their differences to defend their nation. Therefore, an attack by another country is likely to be a centripetal force, not a centrifugal one.\n\nOption D: A charismatic national leader.\n\nA charismatic national leader can have a significant impact on a country. Such a leader often has the ability to inspire and unite people around a common vision or set of goals. They can use their influence to promote national unity and cohesion. For example, Nelson Mandela in South Africa worked tirelessly to heal the wounds of apartheid and bring different racial and cultural groups together. So, generally, a charismatic national leader is seen as a centripetal force.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Religious differences: Can lead to divisions and conflicts, making it a centrifugal force.\n\n- A national holiday: Brings people together, celebrating common history and values, making it a centripetal force.\n\n- An attack by another country: Unites the nation against a common enemy, acting as a centripetal force.\n\n- A charismatic national leader: Inspires unity and cohesion, serving as a centripetal force.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option A: Religious differences.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
