                    "text": "Let's see here. Mr. Maji has a class of 25 students, and most of them, like 22 students, scored between 82 and 94 on a test. Then there are three other students who scored much lower: 47, 55, and 62. The question is asking what these three lower scores are considered in terms of statistical terms, and the options are modes, skewers, outliers, or variances.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each term means in statistics.\n\nStarting with the mode: that's the value that appears most frequently in a set of data. So, in this class, the majority of students scored between 82 and 94. If those scores are clustered in that range, then those scores might be the mode, but the three lower scores are way below that range. So, they're not appearing frequently; in fact, they're unique in their low values. So, I don't think they're modes.\n\nNext, skewers. I'm not entirely sure what \"skewers\" refers to in this context. Maybe it's a typo or something, because in statistics, we usually talk about skewness, not skewers. Skewness refers to the asymmetry of a distribution. If data is skewed, it means it's not symmetrical, and one tail is longer than the other. So, in this case, since most scores are high and a few are low, the distribution is likely skewed to the left. But since \"skewers\" isn't a standard statistical term, I doubt that's the answer.\n\nOutliers: now, this sounds plausible. Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data. They lie outside the overall pattern of the data. In this scenario, the majority of students scored between 82 and 94, and then there are three students who scored much lower: 47, 55, and 62. These lower scores are substantially different from the rest, so they could be considered outliers.\n\nVariance: this is a measure of how spread out the data is from the mean. It's not a term used to describe individual data points, but rather a characteristic of the entire dataset. So, while the variance would tell us about the spread of all the scores, it doesn't specifically label certain points as being exceptional or outside the norm.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think the correct answer is outliers. The three lower scores are significantly different from the majority of the data, making them stand out as potential outliers.\n\nJust to double-check, let's think about the definition again. Outliers are extreme values that differ significantly from other observations. Yes, that fits the situation here. The three students who scored 47, 55, and 62 are significantly below the rest of the class's scores, which are between 82 and 94.\n\nI should also consider if there's any possibility that these scores could be considered something else. For example, could they be part of the main distribution? Well, if the majority of students are scoring in the 80s and 90s, then scores in the 40s, 50s, and 60s are definitely not part of the main cluster.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether these scores are affecting the mean or median of the dataset. Outliers can affect the mean, pulling it in their direction, but they don't necessarily change the median as much, especially in larger datasets. But since the question is specifically asking about these three scores, and not about the impact on the dataset, I think focusing on their classification is appropriate.\n\nSo, after reviewing the options and understanding the context, I'm confident that outliers is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. outliers}} \\]"
