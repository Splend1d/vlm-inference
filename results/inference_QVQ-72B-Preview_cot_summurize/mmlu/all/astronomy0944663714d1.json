                    "text": "So I need to figure out how long it takes Pluto to orbit the Sun once. The options are 150 years, 200 years, 250 years, or 300 years. Hmm, I think I remember that Pluto has a pretty long orbital period because it's so far away from the Sun.\n\nLet me see... I know that Pluto is classified as a dwarf planet now, and it's way out there in the solar system, beyond Neptune. Its orbit is also elliptical, which might affect its orbital period, but maybe for the sake of this question, I can consider it as having a roughly constant period.\n\nI recall that Earth takes about 1 year to orbit the Sun, and Neptune, which is much farther out, takes about 165 Earth years to complete one orbit. Since Pluto is even farther out than Neptune, its orbital period should be longer than Neptune's.\n\nLet me try to recall if I know the exact period for Pluto. I think it's around 248 years, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I can eliminate some options based on what I know.\n\nOption A is 150 years, which seems too short compared to Neptune's 165 years. So, I'll probably eliminate that one.\n\nOption B is 200 years. That's longer than Neptune's period, but I think Pluto's orbit is longer than that.\n\nOption C is 250 years, and D is 300 years. Both seem plausible, but I think 250 years is closer to the actual period.\n\nWait a minute, I think Pluto's orbital period is exactly 248 years. Is that right? Let me try to confirm that.\n\nI remember that Pluto was discovered in 1930, and it completed one full orbit around the Sun in 248 years, which would make its orbital period approximately 248 years. So, that would put it closest to option C, which is 250 years.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I can think about it in terms of Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period of a planet to its average distance from the Sun.\n\nKepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of the orbit. Mathematically, T\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3.\n\nGiven that Earth's orbital period is 1 year and its semi-major axis is approximately 1 astronomical unit (AU), we can use this as a reference.\n\nI know that Neptune is about 30 AU from the Sun, and its orbital period is about 165 years. Pluto is generally beyond Neptune, sometimes crossing inside Neptune's orbit due to its elliptical path, but on average, it's farther out.\n\nIf Neptune is at 30 AU with a 165-year orbit, and Pluto is on average farther, its period should be longer than 165 years.\n\nWait, but according to my previous thought, Pluto's orbital period is 248 years, which is indeed longer than Neptune's 165 years.\n\nSo, between options C (250 years) and D (300 years), 250 years is closer to 248 years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of the square-cube relationship from Kepler's third law.\n\nIf I take the cube root of the orbital period squared, I can estimate the semi-major axis.\n\nBut that might be too complicated for this situation. Maybe it's easier to just recall that Pluto's orbital period is about 248 years, which is closest to 250 years among the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the time it takes for Pluto to go around the Sun based on its average distance.\n\nBut I think I'm overcomplicating this. The straightforward answer is that Pluto's orbital period is approximately 248 years, which is closest to option C, 250 years.\n\nSo, I'll go with option C: 250 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
