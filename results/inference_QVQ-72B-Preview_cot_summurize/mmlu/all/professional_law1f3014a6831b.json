                    "text": "So I've got this trust law problem here, and I need to figure out if Harriet is likely to prevail in her action to have the income from Walter's trust paid to Grace. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, some background: Walter died in 1997 and left $1,000,000 to Trend Trust Company. The trust is set up to pay the income to his son, Stan, for life. After Stan's death, the income is to be paid to any widow of Stan. After her death, the income is to be paid to the living children of Walter's sister, Harriet, in equal shares.\n\nHarriet is trying to get the income paid to Grace, who is Harriet's only surviving child, born in 2001. Both Stan and his wife Morgana died in a plane crash in 2009. There's no mention of any other widows or children, so I assume Morgana was Stan's only widow.\n\nNow, the question is whether Harriet can successfully argue that Grace should receive the income from the trust. The options are:\n\nA. No, because Grace was not a life-in-being at the time of Walter's death.\n\nB. No, because the provisions under which Grace was intended to take violate the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nC. Yes, because that was Walter's intent.\n\nD. Yes, because all other persons who would have had any claim to the income from the trust corpus are deceased.\n\nAlright, let's analyze these options one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: No, because Grace was not a life-in-being at the time of Walter's death.\n\nI need to recall what \"life-in-being\" means. In trust law, especially concerning the Rule against Perpetuities, a \"life-in-being\" refers to any person alive at the time the interest is created who could potentially affect the duration of the trust.\n\nWalter died in 1997, and Grace was born in 2001. So, Grace was not alive when Walter died. Does that matter for her entitlement to the income from the trust?\n\nWell, the trust provides that after Stan's death and his widow's death, the income should go to the living children of Harriet in equal shares. Harriet was alive when Walter died, and she had children, including Grace, who was born later.\n\nI think the key here is whether Grace qualifies as one of Harriet's living children at the time the trust was created or at some other point.\n\nIn trust law, generally, children born after the creation of the trust can still be beneficiaries if they are within a class of beneficiaries defined in the trust deed. In this case, the trust says \"living children of my sister, Harriet,\" which is a class that includes any children Harriet has, regardless of when they were born.\n\nSo, even though Grace wasn't born when Walter died, she is still a living child of Harriet and should be included in the class of beneficiaries.\n\nTherefore, option A seems incorrect because Grace doesn't have to be a life-in-being at Walter's death to be a beneficiary of the trust.\n\nMoving on to option B: No, because the provisions under which Grace was intended to take violate the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nThe Rule against Perpetuities is a complex doctrine in property law that generally prevents interests in property from being tied up indefinitely. It requires that any future interest must vest, if at all, within a certain period, usually the lifetime of some person alive at the time the interest was created plus 21 years.\n\nIn this case, the trust provides for income to be paid first to Stan for life, then to any widow of Stan for her life, and then to Harriet's living children.\n\nStan died in 2009, and his widow Morgana also died in 2009. So, both are deceased.\n\nNow, the income is supposed to go to Harriet's living children. Harriet is still alive, and she has children, including Grace.\n\nBut wait, the problem says Harriet is bringing the action on behalf of Grace. So, Harriet is alive.\n\nBut the trust says the income is to be paid to the living children of Harriet in equal shares.\n\nIf Harriet is alive, and Grace is one of her living children, then Grace should be entitled to a share of the income.\n\nBut perhaps there's an issue with the perpetuities rule here.\n\nLet me think about the vesting period.\n\nThe interest in the income is contingent upon being a living child of Harriet at the time the trust takes effect after Stan's widow's death.\n\nHarriet was alive when Walter died, so she's a life-in-being.\n\nHer children are a class that can expand if she has more children, but since she's already had Grace and presumably others, and Grace is the only surviving one, that might not be an issue.\n\nBut the Rule against Perpetuities generally allows interests to vest within a life or lives in being plus 21 years.\n\nGiven that Harriet was alive in 1997 when Walter died, and she's still alive in 2009 when Stan and Morgana died, the interest in the income for Harriet's living children should vest within Harriet's lifetime plus 21 years.\n\nSince Harriet is still alive, and Grace is her living child, the interest should vest during Harriet's lifetime.\n\nTherefore, the perpetuities rule shouldn't be an issue here because the interest is vesting within the lifetime of Harriet, who was alive when the trust was created.\n\nSo, option B seems incorrect because the perpetuities rule doesn't appear to be violated in this scenario.\n\nNow, option C: Yes, because that was Walter's intent.\n\nWell, Walter's will clearly states that after Stan's death and his widow's death, the income should go to Harriet's living children in equal shares.\n\nGrace is one of Harriet's living children, so according to the will, she should receive a share of the income.\n\nTherefore, it seems that Walter intended for Grace to receive a share of the income, provided she is a living child of Harriet at the time the trust takes effect.\n\nSo, this option seems plausible.\n\nFinally, option D: Yes, because all other persons who would have had any claim to the income from the trust corpus are deceased.\n\nThis seems a bit confusing.\n\nThe trust provides for income to be paid first to Stan for life, then to any widow of Stan for her life, and then to Harriet's living children.\n\nStan and his widow Morgana are both deceased, so the next in line are Harriet's living children.\n\nSince Grace is the only surviving child of Harriet, she should be the sole beneficiary of the income.\n\nBut the problem mentions that Harriet is bringing the action on behalf of Grace, implying that Harriet is still alive.\n\nSo, if Harriet has other living children, they might also be entitled to shares of the income.\n\nBut the problem specifies that Grace is Harriet's only surviving child.\n\nTherefore, Grace should be the sole beneficiary of the income.\n\nHowever, the statement in option D that \"all other persons who would have had any claim to the income from the trust corpus are deceased\" might not be entirely accurate because Harriet herself might have some interest, or there could be other factors at play.\n\nBut given the information provided, it seems that Stan and Morgana are deceased, and Harriet has only one surviving child, Grace.\n\nTherefore, Grace should be the one to receive the income.\n\nSo, perhaps option D is also plausible, but it's a bit unclear.\n\nBetween options C and D, option C seems more directly related to Walter's intent, which is clearly stated in his will.\n\nOption D seems to be more about the fact that other potential beneficiaries are deceased, but in this case, it's only Grace who is alive among Harriet's children.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is option C: Yes, because that was Walter's intent.\n\nThe fact that Grace was not alive when Walter died doesn't disqualify her from being a beneficiary, as she is a living child of Harriet.\n\nMoreover, the perpetuities rule doesn't seem to be an issue here, as the interest vests within the lifetime of Harriet, who was alive when the trust was created.\n\nTherefore, Harriet is likely to prevail in her action to have the income from the trust paid to Grace.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
