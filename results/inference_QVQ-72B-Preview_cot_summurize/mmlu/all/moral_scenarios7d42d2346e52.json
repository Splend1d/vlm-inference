                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"When my toddler peed on the hotel mattress, I turned the mattress over before we left.\"\n\nSo, here's what happened. The person's toddler peed on the hotel mattress. That's something that can happen, especially with young kids. But instead of informing the hotel or trying to clean it properly, the person just turned the mattress over before leaving. Hmm, that seems a bit shady. They're basically trying to hide the fact that the mattress was soiled.\n\nNow, morally, what's the right thing to do in this situation? I think the right thing would be to inform the hotel staff about the incident so they can properly clean or replace the mattress. Hotels rely on maintaining cleanliness for their guests, and hiding something like this could cause problems for the next guests or for the hotel's housekeeping staff.\n\nBut did the person actually do something morally wrong by turning the mattress over? Well, it's not directly harming anyone, but it's definitely dishonest. It's like trying to cover up something that should be addressed. In terms of moral standards, honesty and responsibility are important values. By not owning up to what happened, the person is shirking their responsibility.\n\nLet me consider if there are any laws or regulations related to this. I don't know specifics about hotel policies in 2020, but generally, if damage is caused to property, it's expected that the responsible party reports it. Maybe there's a damage deposit or something, but even if there isn't, it's still the ethical thing to do.\n\nSo, in this scenario, I would say that turning the mattress over without informing the hotel is morally wrong because it's dishonest and irresponsible.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: \"I broke the glass ceiling on my neighbor's house.\"\n\nThis one sounds a bit different. It seems like the person broke a glass ceiling on their neighbor's house. A glass ceiling is typically associated with barriers preventing certain groups from advancing in society, like in workplaces, but here it's literal glass in a house.\n\nSo, breaking a glass ceiling on a neighbor's house would mean damaging their property. Damaging someone else's property without permission is generally considered wrong, both legally and morally.\n\nIn terms of moral standards, respecting other people's property is a fundamental principle. Breaking someone's property intentionally or negligently is wrong because it disrespects their rights and can cause them financial burden to repair or replace the damaged item.\n\nMoreover, if this act was done maliciously, it's even more clearly wrong. If it was an accident, then the person should take responsibility for the damage and offer to repair or compensate the neighbor.\n\nGiven that the statement says \"I broke the glass ceiling on my neighbor's house,\" it doesn't specify the circumstances, but regardless, it's generally wrong to cause damage to someone else's property without their consent or without good reason.\n\nSo, in this scenario, breaking the glass ceiling is morally wrong.\n\nNow, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Turning the mattress over without informing the hotel after a toddler peed on it is morally wrong due to dishonesty and lack of responsibility.\n\n- Scenario 2: Breaking the glass ceiling on a neighbor's house is morally wrong because it's damaging someone else's property without permission.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios are morally wrong.\n\nThe answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there are any exceptions or different perspectives that might categorize one of these actions as not wrong.\n\nFor scenario 1, some might argue that it's just a minor incident and that hotels expect some level of wear and tear. However, it's still about honesty and transparency. If the person had informed the hotel, they might have been understanding, but hiding it is still unethical.\n\nFor scenario 2, if the glass ceiling was already broken or if there was a good reason for breaking it, like an emergency, then it might not be wrong. But the statement doesn't provide any context, so we have to assume it's just breaking it without a valid reason.\n\nGiven that, I think both actions are morally wrong.\n\nSo, the correct choice is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
