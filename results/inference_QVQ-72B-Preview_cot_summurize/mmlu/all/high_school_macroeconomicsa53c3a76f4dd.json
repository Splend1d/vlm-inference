                    "text": "Let's see here. The question is about the economy being at full employment, and it's asking which policy will create the most inflation in the short run. There are four options:\n\nA. An increase in government spending matched by an equal increase in taxes\n\nB. An increase in government spending with no change in taxes\n\nC. A decrease in government spending and a matching increase in taxes\n\nD. A decrease in taxes with no change in government spending\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what happens when the economy is at full employment. Full employment means that everyone who wants a job has one, right? So, the labor force is fully utilized. In this scenario, if demand increases, it might lead to inflation because companies can't produce more goods without increasing prices.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: An increase in government spending matched by an equal increase in taxes.\n\nSo, if the government spends more but also increases taxes by the same amount, what's the net effect? I think the net effect on aggregate demand is zero because the increase in spending is offset by the increase in taxes, which reduces consumer spending. So, no change in total demand, meaning no inflationary pressure from this policy.\n\nOption B: An increase in government spending with no change in taxes.\n\nHere, the government is spending more without raising taxes. This should increase total demand in the economy because more money is being pumped in through spending, and taxes aren't being increased to take any of it back. So, this should lead to an increase in aggregate demand, which could cause inflation if the economy is already at full employment.\n\nOption C: A decrease in government spending and a matching increase in taxes.\n\nSo, the government is spending less and taxing more. This should decrease aggregate demand because there's less government spending and consumers have less disposable income due to higher taxes. If the economy is at full employment, reducing demand might actually help prevent inflation, not cause it.\n\nOption D: A decrease in taxes with no change in government spending.\n\nIn this case, taxes are being cut while government spending remains the same. This should increase aggregate demand because consumers have more disposable income and will likely spend more. This increased demand could lead to inflation if the economy is already at full employment.\n\nSo, comparing B and D: both should increase aggregate demand and potentially cause inflation. But which one would create more inflation?\n\nIn option B, the government is spending more directly, which increases demand through direct purchases. In option D, taxes are being cut, which increases disposable income and thus consumer spending, but it's indirect.\n\nI think direct government spending might have a larger immediate impact on aggregate demand compared to a tax cut, which relies on the marginal propensity to consume of households. So, perhaps option B would lead to more inflation in the short run.\n\nBut, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the tax cut in option D could lead to a larger increase in aggregate demand if the multiplier effect is considered, especially if the tax cut goes to lower-income individuals who are more likely to spend it.\n\nWait, but in the short run, maybe the direct government spending would have a quicker impact on demand and prices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of fiscal policy multipliers. The multiplier for government spending is larger than that for a tax cut, I believe, because government spending is directly injected into the economy, while a tax cut first has to be spent by consumers.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then option B would have a larger impact on aggregate demand and thus potentially lead to more inflation in the short run compared to option D.\n\nOption A, as I thought earlier, should have a neutral effect since the increase in spending is offset by the increase in taxes.\n\nOption C should be contractionary, reducing aggregate demand and possibly helping to control inflation, not increase it.\n\nTherefore, between options B and D, option B seems to have the potential to create more inflation in the short run due to the larger multiplier effect of government spending compared to tax cuts.\n\nI think the answer is B. An increase in government spending with no change in taxes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
