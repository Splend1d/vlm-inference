                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem here about cans of soup in Rolando's cupboard. It says that half of the cans are tomato and two-fifths are chicken noodle. I need to find out what fraction of the cans are either tomato or chicken noodle. The options are A. 7-Mar, B. 5-Mar, C. 10-Jul, D. 10-Sep. Hmm, those don't look like typical fractions, so maybe they're just labels or something. I need to focus on the problem.\n\nOkay, so if half the cans are tomato, that's 1/2. And two-fifths are chicken noodle, which is 2/5. I need to find the total fraction that is either tomato or chicken noodle. To do that, I should add these two fractions together.\n\nSo, 1/2 plus 2/5. But fractions need a common denominator to be added directly. The denominators are 2 and 5, and the least common multiple of 2 and 5 is 10. So, I'll convert both fractions to have a denominator of 10.\n\nFor 1/2, to get a denominator of 10, I multiply both numerator and denominator by 5: 1*5 / 2*5 = 5/10.\n\nFor 2/5, to get a denominator of 10, I multiply both numerator and denominator by 2: 2*2 / 5*2 = 4/10.\n\nNow, I can add these together: 5/10 + 4/10 = 9/10.\n\nWait a minute, but none of the options seem to be 9/10. Let me check again. Maybe I missed something.\n\nThe problem says: \"1/2 are tomato and 2/5 are chicken noodle.\" So, adding them up: 1/2 + 2/5.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe finding a common denominator isn't necessary, or maybe there's a different way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about converting both fractions to decimals or to percentages, but that seems unnecessary for adding fractions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can cross-multiply to add the fractions.\n\nSo, 1/2 + 2/5 = (1*5 + 2*2) / (2*5) = (5 + 4) / 10 = 9/10. Yep, that's consistent with what I got earlier.\n\nMaybe the options are miswritten or perhaps there's a trick here that I'm missing. Let me read the problem again carefully.\n\n\"Of the cans of soup in Rolando\u2019s cupboard, 1/2 are tomato and 2/5 are chicken noodle. What fraction of the cans of soup in Rolando\u2019s cupboard are either tomato or chicken noodle?\"\n\nOkay, so it's asking for the combined fraction of tomato and chicken noodle cans. So, 1/2 plus 2/5 should be 9/10, as I calculated.\n\nBut looking back at the options:\n\nA. 7-Mar\n\nB. 5-Mar\n\nC. 10-Jul\n\nD. 10-Sep\n\nNone of these seem to correspond to 9/10. Maybe there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the fractions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fractions are not meant to be added directly. Maybe there's an overlap between tomato and chicken noodle cans that I need to account for.\n\nWait a second, maybe some cans could be both tomato and chicken noodle, but that doesn't make much sense. Typically, a can is either tomato or chicken noodle, not both. So, probably, these are distinct categories, and I can just add the fractions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about probability or something else, but no, it seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are labeled incorrectly, or maybe the letters refer to something else. But assuming it's a math problem, and the letters are just placeholders, then 9/10 should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, maybe I need to simplify 9/10 further, but 9/10 is already in its simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in a different form, like decimals or percentages, but that seems unlikely given the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fractions are meant to represent something else, but that seems far-fetched.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the options, and one of them should be 9/10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that some cans might not be either tomato or chicken noodle, but the problem is specifically asking for the fraction that are either, so I think adding 1/2 and 2/5 is the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to interpret \"fraction of the cans.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is testing whether I know how to add fractions with different denominators, and I've already done that correctly.\n\nGiven all that, I think the answer should be 9/10, but since that's not among the options, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are supposed to represent different fractions, but it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in a reduced form, but 9/10 is already reduced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup, but assuming it's correctly stated, adding 1/2 and 2/5 gives 9/10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are mislabeled or there's an error in the question.\n\nGiven all that, I think the answer is 9/10, even though it's not explicitly listed in the options provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{10}} \\]"
