                    "text": "Let's see here. The theater sold 500 tickets and each ticket costs $6. So, to find out how much money they collected, I need to multiply 6 by 500. That should give me the total revenue, right?\n\nSo, 6 times 500. Let me calculate that. 6 times 500 is the same as 6 times 5 with three zeros, which is 3,000. So, the theater collected $3,000 in total.\n\nNow, the question is asking which expression can also be used to find this same amount. So, I need to look at the options and see which one equals $3,000.\n\nOption A is 30 times 10 to the power of 1. Let's compute that. 10 to the power of 1 is 10, so 30 times 10 is 300. That's not $3,000.\n\nOption B is 30 times 10 to the power of 3. 10 to the power of 3 is 1,000, so 30 times 1,000 is 30,000. That's more than $3,000.\n\nOption C is (6 times 5) times 10 to the power of 2. First, 6 times 5 is 30, and 10 to the power of 2 is 100, so 30 times 100 is 3,000. That matches our total revenue.\n\nOption D is (6 times 5) times 10 to the power of 3. Again, 6 times 5 is 30, and 10 to the power of 3 is 1,000, so 30 times 1,000 is 30,000, which is more than $3,000.\n\nSo, among these options, only option C gives me $3,000, which matches the total revenue from selling 500 tickets at $6 each.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe by factoring or rearranging the numbers. Let's try to think differently.\n\nI know that 6 times 500 is 3,000. Can I break down 500 in another way to match one of the other expressions?\n\nFor example, 500 is 5 times 100, right? So, 6 times 500 is the same as 6 times 5 times 100. That's option C: (6 \u00d7 5) \u00d7 10^2, which is indeed 30 times 100, which is 3,000.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of 500 as 5 times 10^2, since 10^2 is 100. So, 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 10^2. But that's the same as option C.\n\nOption A is 30 \u00d7 10^1, which is 30 \u00d7 10 = 300, which is not 3,000.\n\nOption B is 30 \u00d7 10^3, which is 30 \u00d7 1,000 = 30,000, which is too much.\n\nOption D is also 30 \u00d7 10^3, which is the same as option B, so that's also 30,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is option C: (6 \u00d7 5) \u00d7 10^2, which equals $3,000, matching the total revenue calculated from 6 \u00d7 500.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be sure, maybe I should check if there's any other way to interpret the question or the expressions.\n\nWait, the question says \"which expression can also be used to find how much money the theater collected for the tickets?\" So, it's asking for an equivalent expression to 6 \u00d7 500, which is $3,000.\n\nAmong the options, only option C evaluates to $3,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
