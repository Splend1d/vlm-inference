                    "text": "So I have this problem here: cat food costs $0.47 per pound, and I need to find out how much a 6-pound bag costs. Let's see, I need to multiply the cost per pound by the number of pounds, right? So, that's $0.47 times 6.\n\nHmm, multiplying decimals can be tricky for me sometimes, but I think I can handle this. Let's write it down:\n\n0.47 \u00d7 6 =\n\nFirst, I'll ignore the decimal and multiply 47 by 6.\n\n47 \u00d7 6 = 282.\n\nNow, I need to place the decimal back in. The original price is $0.47, which has two decimal places, and 6 is a whole number, so the result should have two decimal places.\n\nSo, $0.47 \u00d7 6 = $2.82.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. Let me just double-check that.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the units. Since it's dollars per pound times pounds, the pounds cancel out, leaving just dollars.\n\nWait, no, actually, it's dollars per pound times pounds, which should indeed give dollars. So, $0.47/lb \u00d7 6 lb = $2.82.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $2.82\n\nB. $2.97\n\nC. $6.47\n\nD. $12.77\n\nSo, according to my calculation, option A seems correct.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's a different approach or something I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the decimal to cents to make it easier.\n\n$0.47 is 47 cents.\n\nSo, 47 cents per pound times 6 pounds would be 282 cents.\n\nNow, 282 cents is $2.82.\n\nThat matches my previous result.\n\nAnother way: I could break down 0.47 \u00d7 6.\n\n0.47 \u00d7 6 = (0.4 \u00d7 6) + (0.07 \u00d7 6)\n\n= 2.4 + 0.42\n\n= 2.82\n\nAgain, that gives me $2.82.\n\nWait a minute, let's consider if there's any tax or other costs, but the problem doesn't mention that, so I assume it's just the cost per pound times the number of pounds.\n\nAlso, checking the other options:\n\nB. $2.97 \u2013 that's close but not matching.\n\nC. $6.47 \u2013 that seems too high compared to $0.47 per pound for 6 pounds.\n\nD. $12.77 \u2013 that's definitely too high.\n\nI think I'm confident with my answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the units again.\n\nThe cost is $0.47 per pound.\n\nFor 6 pounds, the cost should be $0.47 \u00d7 6.\n\nWhich is $2.82.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI don't think there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. $2.82.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ \\$2.82} \\]"
