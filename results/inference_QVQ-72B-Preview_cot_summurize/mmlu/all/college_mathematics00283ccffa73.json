Hmm, I need to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a p-norm is. I know that the p-norm of a vector x in n-dimensional space is defined as ||x||_p = (|x_1|^p + |x_2|^p + ... + |x_n|^p)^(1/p) for p >= 1. And for p = infinity, it's defined as the maximum of the absolute values of the components.\n\nNow, an inner product on a vector space gives rise to a norm via the formula ||x|| = sqrt(<x, x>), where <x, x> is the inner product of x with itself.\n\nSo, the question is asking for which values of p the norm ||x||_p can be expressed in the form sqrt(<x, x>) for some inner product <.,.>.\n\nI remember there's a theorem that relates norms coming from inner products to norms that satisfy the parallelogram law. But maybe there's a simpler way to think about this.\n\nLet me consider the case when n=1. Then the p-norm is just ||x||_p = |x|, which is the absolute value. The norm induced by the inner product would be sqrt(<x, x>) = |x|, since <x, x> would be x^2. So in this case, any p would work, but that's not helpful because the question is about norms in higher dimensions.\n\nMaybe I should look at the Euclidean norm, which is p=2. That's the most common inner product norm. In that case, ||x||_2 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ... + x_n^2)^(1/2), which is indeed derived from the standard inner product <x, y> = x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2 + ... + x_n y_n.\n\nSo, for p=2, it's definitely expressible as an inner product. That makes sense.\n\nNow, what about p=1? Let's see. For p=1, ||x||_1 = |x_1| + |x_2| + ... + |x_n|. Can this be expressed as sqrt(<x, x>) for some inner product?\n\nSuppose there exists an inner product <.,.> such that ||x||_1 = sqrt(<x, x>). Then, squaring both sides, ||x||_1^2 = <x, x>. But ||x||_1^2 = (|x_1| + |x_2| + ... + |x_n|)^2, which expands to x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ... + x_n^2 + 2 times the sum of the absolute values of the products of different components.\n\nOn the other hand, if <x, x> = a_{11}x_1^2 + a_{22}x_2^2 + ... + a_{nn}x_n^2 + 2(a_{12}x_1x_2 + a_{13}x_1x_3 + ...), then for ||x||_1^2 to equal <x, x>, we'd need a_{ii} = 1 for all i, and a_{ij} = 0 for all i \u2260 j, which would make <x, x> = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ... + x_n^2.\n\nBut ||x||_1^2 is not equal to that; it includes cross terms. So, it seems impossible for ||x||_1 to be equal to sqrt(<x, x>) for any inner product.\n\nTherefore, p=1 is not a valid option.\n\nWhat about p=\u221e? The infinity norm is ||x||_\u221e = max{|x_1|, |x_2|, ..., |x_n|}. Can this be expressed as sqrt(<x, x>) for some inner product?\n\nAgain, if such an inner product exists, then ||x||_\u221e^2 = <x, x>. But ||x||_\u221e^2 is the square of the maximum absolute value component. This doesn't seem to match the form of any inner product I can think of, especially since inner products are bilinear and symmetric, and their associated norms satisfy the parallelogram law.\n\nI recall that the only norms that come from inner products are those that satisfy the parallelogram law: ||x + y||^2 + ||x - y||^2 = 2(||x||^2 + ||y||^2). I should check if the p-norm satisfies this for p=2 and not for other p.\n\nAlternatively, there's a theorem that says a norm comes from an inner product if and only if it satisfies the parallelogram law. It's known that the Euclidean norm does, but other p-norms for p \u2260 2 do not.\n\nSo, based on that, it seems that only p=2 is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. Suppose p \u2260 2. Then, the p-norm doesn't satisfy the parallelogram law, and hence cannot be induced by an inner product.\n\nTherefore, the only value of p for which ||x||_p is expressible as an inner product is p=2.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
