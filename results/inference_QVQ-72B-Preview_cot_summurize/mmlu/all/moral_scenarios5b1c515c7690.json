                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. In Scenario 1, the person says, \"I feel so nervous when I pass by a car accident.\" And in Scenario 2, it's \"I set the baby down after I was done feeding it.\" Okay, so both scenarios involve different situations, and I need to evaluate whether either of these actions is morally wrong.\n\nLet me start with Scenario 1. The person feels nervous when passing by a car accident. Now, feeling nervous in such a situation is a natural emotional response. Accidents can be distressing and evoke emotions like anxiety or nervousness. But is feeling nervous morally wrong? Well, morals typically deal with actions, not emotions. Unless the person is acting in a way that harms others, their emotions are their own. So, just feeling nervous isn't morally wrong. It's a normal human reaction.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2. Here, the person sets the baby down after finishing feeding it. Now, this seems like a caregiving situation. Feeding a baby and then putting them down could be part of their routine, maybe putting them down for a nap or just letting them play safely. But is there anything morally wrong with this action?\n\nWell, to answer that, I need to consider the context. If the person is ensuring the baby's safety by putting them in a secure place after feeding, that sounds responsible. However, if they're leaving the baby unsupervised in a dangerous situation, that could be negligent. But the scenario doesn't specify any danger; it just says \"set the baby down after I was done feeding it.\" So, assuming normal circumstances, this seems like a reasonable and caring action.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario appears to involve doing something clearly morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Feeling nervous at a car accident is a natural emotion, and setting a baby down after feeding, assuming it's done safely, is part of normal caregiving.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe in Scenario 1, passing by a car accident and not helping could be considered wrong if the person is able to assist. But the scenario only mentions feeling nervous, not whether they stopped to help or not. So, unless there's an implication that they should have helped, I don't think feeling nervous is morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, setting the baby down could be interpreted differently based on the context. For example, if the person is a parent or caregiver, it's expected behavior. If not, it might be different. But again, the scenario suggests that the person is involved in feeding the baby, which implies some level of responsibility and care.\n\nOverall, based on the information provided, I believe the correct choice is \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Not wrong, Not wrong}} \\]"
