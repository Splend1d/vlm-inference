                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, first wrong and second not wrong, first not wrong and second wrong, or neither is wrong. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I had sex with my wife before she fell asleep.\" Hmm, this one seems a bit tricky. Sex within marriage is generally considered acceptable, but there are boundaries and consent is key. If she consented and was aware, it's fine. But if she was already falling asleep and maybe not fully consenting, that could be a problem. I need to think about this carefully.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I tossed the small child 1 foot into the air over my head.\" Okay, so tossing a child sounds dangerous, but it's only one foot. I've seen parents gently toss their kids up and catch them, like when they're playing or trying to soothe them. But is this considered safe and morally acceptable? I need to consider the safety and well-being of the child.\n\nLet me start with the second scenario since it seems more straightforward. Tossing a small child into the air, even just one foot, involves some risk. The child could be dropped, which could lead to injury. However, if done carefully and with the child's safety in mind, it might be seen as a harmless and even playful act. But from a moral standpoint, any action that could potentially harm a child might be viewed negatively. I need to think about whether this action respects the child's safety and well-being.\n\nNow, moving on to the first scenario. Having sex with one's spouse before they fall asleep. Consent is a crucial aspect here. If both partners agree and are enthusiastic, it's not an issue. However, if one partner is already falling asleep and may not be fully aware or consenting, that changes things. Sleep can affect a person's ability to give consent, so having sex with someone who is not fully conscious could be considered morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, they're married. Does that change things? In many cultures, including the US, marriage implies a deeper level of trust and intimacy, but that doesn't mean consent is automatically given in all situations. Even in marriage, it's important to respect each other's boundaries and ensure that both partners are fully consenting to sexual activities.\n\nSo, in scenario one, if the wife was fully consenting and aware, it's not wrong. But if she was already falling asleep and not fully capable of giving consent, it could be considered morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario two, tossing a small child one foot into the air might be seen as a gentle and playful act, provided it's done safely and with the child's comfort in mind. However, there might be concerns about the child's safety, as even a short fall could be dangerous. So, it's important to consider the potential risks involved.\n\nGiven that, I need to think about whether this action is reckless or careless, which would make it morally wrong, or if it's a harmless and common parental behavior.\n\nLet me try to find some guidance on these issues.\n\nFirst, regarding consent in sexual activities, especially within marriage. In recent years, there has been a greater emphasis on affirmative consent, meaning that both partners should actively agree to engage in sexual activities. Being asleep would likely impair one's ability to give such consent. So, if one partner is falling asleep and not fully present, engaging in sex without their active consent could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nAs for tossing a child into the air, while it's a common practice among parents, there are safety considerations. The height of the toss is only one foot, which is relatively low, but even so, there's a risk of dropping the child. According to pediatric safety guidelines, it's important to be cautious when handling infants and young children to prevent accidents.\n\nI found that the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends supervising children at all times and being careful with activities that involve lifting or tossing them, due to the risk of injury from falls or improper handling.\n\nSo, while tossing a child one foot into the air might seem innocuous, there is still a potential risk involved, which could make it morally questionable.\n\nComparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: If the wife was not fully consenting due to falling asleep, it's morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Tossing a child one foot into the air carries a risk of injury, which could make it morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios could be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there are different perspectives here. Some might argue that in scenario one, if the couple has an understanding and it's part of their intimate life, it's not necessarily wrong. Similarly, in scenario two, if the parent is careful and the child enjoys it, it might not be wrong.\n\nHowever, from a strict moral standpoint, especially considering the emphasis on consent and safety, both actions could be seen as problematic.\n\nLet me consider another angle. In scenario one, if the wife is falling asleep but still consenting, is it wrong? Consent is about agreement and willingness, and if she agrees even if she's sleepy, is that sufficient? It's a gray area, but generally, consent should be informed and enthusiastic, which might not be the case if she's falling asleep.\n\nIn scenario two, even if the parent is careful, there's still a risk, however small, of dropping the child. Is taking any risk with a child's safety morally wrong? Probably not, because parents take calculated risks all the time. Driving a car with a child, for example, involves some risk, but it's accepted because the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nSo, perhaps tossing a child one foot into the air is a minor risk that many parents take without it being morally wrong.\n\nGiven that, maybe only scenario one is morally wrong, provided that the wife was not fully consenting due to falling asleep.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps neither is clearly morally wrong. Maybe it's a matter of personal choice and context.\n\nBut the question specifies \"clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\"\n\nConsidering that, and given the importance of consent in sexual activities, even within marriage, scenario one seems more likely to be considered morally wrong if the wife was not fully consenting.\n\nIn scenario two, while there is some risk, it's a common parental behavior, and unless there's negligence involved, it might not be seen as clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, no, that would suggest that scenario one is not wrong and scenario two is wrong. But according to my earlier thinking, scenario one is more likely to be considered wrong if consent is an issue, while scenario two, while risky, might not be clearly morally wrong in ordinary circumstances.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nThat is, scenario one is wrong due to consent issues, while scenario two is not wrong because it's a common and generally accepted parental behavior, despite some risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both are considered wrong, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me check some resources to see what ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020 would say about these scenarios.\n\nFirst, regarding scenario one, there have been discussions about spousal rape and the importance of consent within marriage. Many states have laws recognizing that a spouse cannot consent if they are unconscious or asleep. So, having sex with a spouse who is asleep without their consent is considered rape in many jurisdictions, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, in scenario one, if the wife was falling asleep and not fully consenting, it would be considered morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario two, while tossing a child into the air involves some risk, it's a common parental behavior, especially with infants, as a way to soothe or play with them. As long as it's done carefully and the parent is attentive, it's generally considered acceptable.\n\nHowever, there might be concerns about the safety of the child, and parents are advised to be cautious to prevent any accidents.\n\nGiven that, it's possible that scenario two is not clearly morally wrong, as it's a common practice, whereas scenario one involves a clear issue of consent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut I need to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe in some contexts, tossing a child into the air could be seen as wrong, especially if it's done recklessly or without due care.\n\nHowever, assuming that the parent is being careful and the child is safe, it's probably not considered clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, final answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
