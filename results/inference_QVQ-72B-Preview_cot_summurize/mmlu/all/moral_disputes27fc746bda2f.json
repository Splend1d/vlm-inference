                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about Sinnott-Armstrong's main interests in examining moral obligations. The options are individuals, societies, governments, or families. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall who Sinnott-Armstrong is. I think he's a philosopher, maybe specializes in ethics or something like that. But I'm not entirely sure about his specific focus areas. Maybe I should start by looking him up to get some background information.\n\nOkay, after a quick search, I find out that Walter Sinnott-Armstrong is an American philosopher who teaches at Duke University. He works primarily in ethics, moral psychology, and the philosophy of law. That gives me a general idea, but I still need to pinpoint his specific interests regarding moral obligations.\n\nLooking further, I see that he's written several books and articles on various ethical topics. One that stands out is \"Moral Dilemmas and Moral Theory,\" which might touch on the obligations of different entities. Another is \"Thinking About Luck,\" which could relate to moral luck and individual responsibilities.\n\nWait, but the question is specifically about moral obligations. So, obligations of individuals, societies, governments, or families. I need to find out which of these is his primary focus.\n\nLet me check some of his publications to see where his interests lie. In \"Moral Dilemmas and Moral Theory,\" he might discuss the obligations individuals face in difficult moral situations. Similarly, in \"Thinking About Luck,\" he might explore how luck affects individual moral obligations.\n\nBut does he focus solely on individuals, or does he also consider larger entities like societies or governments? Maybe both.\n\nLooking at another source, I find that he's involved in the field of neuroethics, which studies the neural processes underlying moral decision-making. This seems more focused on individual decision-making processes, suggesting that he might be more interested in individual moral obligations.\n\nHowever, I also come across a book he co-edited called \"Moral Psychology,\" which could cover a wider range of topics, including the moral obligations of different groups.\n\nPerhaps I should consider his academic background and see if that gives any clues. He has a PhD in philosophy from Harvard, which is known for its strong ethics programs, so that aligns with his expertise in ethics.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I can look for interviews or talks he's given to get a sense of what he's most passionate about.\n\nAfter searching for videos and interviews, I find one where he discusses the concept of moral luck and how it affects our judgments of moral responsibility. This seems to again point towards individual moral obligations.\n\nAnother interview mentions his work on the trolley problem, a classic thought experiment in ethics that deals with individual moral choices in extreme scenarios.\n\nBut still, I'm not sure if this is enough to conclude that he's most interested in individual obligations. Maybe he also discusses the roles of society and government in shaping moral norms.\n\nWait, I found a paper he co-authored called \"Neuroscience and Philosophy: Identity, Free Will, and Moral Responsibility.\" This seems to delve into the relationship between brain activity and moral decision-making, again focusing on the individual level.\n\nAnother publication is \"Is There a Role for Neuroscience in Moral Education?\" which suggests that he might be considering how understanding the brain can inform how we teach morals to individuals.\n\nHmm, all of this points towards a focus on individuals, but I want to make sure I'm not missing something about his views on societies, governments, or families.\n\nLet me check his website or personal page to see if he has any statements about his research interests.\n\nOn his faculty page at Duke, I see a list of his research areas: ethics, moral psychology, philosophy of law, and neuroethics. Again, these areas seem to center around individual moral agency.\n\nUnder his publications, there are several books and articles on moral dilemmas, moral luck, and neuroethics, reinforcing the individual focus.\n\nBut perhaps he also writes about the moral obligations of societies or governments. Let's see if any of his papers touch on those topics.\n\nI found a paper titled \"When Biology Isn't Destiny: The Challenge of Neuroenhancement,\" which discusses the ethical implications of enhancing human capabilities through neurological interventions. This could have implications for both individuals and society as a whole.\n\nAnother paper is \"Can Neuroscience Contribute to Legal Theory?\" which explores how neurological findings might influence legal concepts such as free will and responsibility. Again, this seems more focused on individuals within the context of law.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider his work on the philosophy of law. Laws are typically enacted by governments to regulate society, so perhaps there's some overlap there.\n\nLooking back, I see that he has written about the moral and legal responsibilities of governments in certain contexts, like in times of war or in implementing public policies.\n\nFor example, one of his papers discusses the moral justifications for preemptive war, which involves government decisions at the international level.\n\nAnother paper looks at the moral obligations of governments in addressing climate change, considering intergenerational justice.\n\nHmm, so it seems that while much of his work focuses on individual moral obligations, he also engages with the moral obligations of governments.\n\nBut the question is asking about what he is \"most interested in examining,\" so I need to determine where his primary focus lies.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the bulk of his publications and research activities. From what I can gather, the majority of his work seems to center on individual moral psychology, moral decision-making in the brain, and the philosophy of law, which often deals with individual rights and responsibilities.\n\nHis work on government obligations appears to be more specific to certain issues like war and climate change, whereas his individual-focused research is more comprehensive and covers a wider range of topics.\n\nTherefore, it might be reasonable to conclude that Sinnott-Armstrong is most interested in examining the moral obligations of individuals.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check if there's any evidence to suggest that he prioritizes individual obligations over those of societies, governments, or families.\n\nLooking back at his publications, I don't see a direct emphasis on families as a separate entity, so option D seems less likely.\n\nAs for societies and governments, while he does touch on these topics, especially in his work on law and policy, his primary area of expertise appears to be in individual moral psychology and decision-making.\n\nMoreover, in his work on neuroethics, he explores how neurological research can inform our understanding of moral behavior, which again points back to individual-level analysis.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it seems that Sinnott-Armstrong's main interest lies in examining the moral obligations of individuals.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. individuals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ individuals}} \\]"
