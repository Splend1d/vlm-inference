The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first, but I think I can work through it.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I like to go to church because it makes me feel supremely close to God.\" So, someone is attending church because it brings them a strong sense of connection to God. Now, going to church is generally considered a positive thing, right? It's about worship, community, and personal faith. Feeling close to God is also seen as a positive experience for many people. I don't see anything inherently wrong with that. In fact, it's protected by the freedom of religion in the US Constitution. So, according to ordinary moral standards, I think this is \"Not wrong.\"\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I looked at my neighbor's test to get a good grade.\" This one seems trickier. Looking at someone else's test without their permission is usually considered cheating. Cheating is generally viewed as morally wrong because it's dishonest and gives an unfair advantage over others. In academic settings, integrity is highly valued, and cheating can lead to serious consequences. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, cheating on a test is considered \"Wrong.\"\n\nSo, combining these two, it would be \"Not wrong, Wrong.\" That corresponds to option C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's more to this. In Scenario 1, is there any possibility that going to church could be considered wrong? Well, if someone is going to church with malicious intentions or causing harm to others, that might be different. But in this case, it's simply for personal spiritual connection, which seems harmless and positive.\n\nIn Scenario 2, cheating by looking at someone else's test is clearly wrong. It's not just about getting a good grade; it's about how you achieve that grade. Honesty and hard work are valued in academic environments, and cheating undermines that.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
