                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about the temperature on Mars. It says that during the day, the temperature reaches 27\u00b0C, and at night, it drops to \u2212125\u00b0C. I need to find the average temperature. Okay, so average usually means I have to add up the temperatures and then divide by the number of values I have.\n\nFirst, I should add 27\u00b0C and \u2212125\u00b0C. Hmm, positive 27 and negative 125. I need to be careful with the signs here. When I add a positive number and a negative number, it's like subtracting the smaller number from the larger one, but I have to pay attention to the sign of the larger number.\n\nSo, 125 is larger than 27. Subtracting 27 from 125 gives me 98, and since 125 is negative and it's the larger number, the result should be negative. So, 27 + (\u2212125) = \u221298\u00b0C.\n\nNow, to find the average, I need to divide this sum by the number of temperatures I have. There are two temperatures given: one for day and one for night. So, I have two values.\n\nSo, the average temperature is \u221298\u00b0C divided by 2. Let's do that calculation: \u221298 \u00f7 2 = \u221249\u00b0C.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 76\u00b0C\n\nB. \u221249\u00b0C\n\nC. 49\u00b0C\n\nD. \u221276\u00b0C\n\nMy calculation gives me \u221249\u00b0C, which matches option B.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I'm handling the signs correctly. The day temperature is 27\u00b0C, and the night temperature is \u2212125\u00b0C. To find the average of these two, I add them together and then divide by 2.\n\nSo, 27 + (\u2212125) = \u221298\u00b0C, and then \u221298 \u00f7 2 = \u221249\u00b0C. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Is there any other factor that could affect the average temperature? For example, is the day longer than the night, or do I need to consider the time each temperature is maintained?\n\nThe problem doesn't provide any information about the duration of day and night, so I think it's safe to assume that we're just supposed to find the simple average of the two given temperatures. If there were more information about the durations, it might be different, but as it stands, adding and dividing by two is the way to go.\n\nAlso, considering the options, 76\u00b0C and 49\u00b0C are positive, but given that one of the temperatures is \u2212125\u00b0C, having a positive average seems unlikely because the night temperature is so much colder than the day temperature. So, a negative average makes sense.\n\nJust to make sure, let's think about it in terms of absolute values. The night temperature is much colder than the day temperature is warm, so the average should lean towards the colder side, which is negative.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. \u221249\u00b0C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ \u221249^\\circ C} \\]"
