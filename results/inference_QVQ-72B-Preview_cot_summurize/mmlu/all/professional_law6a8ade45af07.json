After taking possession of the tract, the daughter executed and delivered a warranty deed to a buyer, purporting to convey all 100 acres of the tract. The agreed purchase price was $100,000.

                    "text": "So I've got this property law scenario here, and I need to figure out who owns this five-acre tract. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a father who left a will giving a 100-acre tract to his daughter. But at the time of his death, he thought he owned the whole 100 acres, but actually, he only owned 95 acres. The other five acres were owned by a farmer. So, when the daughter inherited the property, she only inherited 95 acres, right? Because the father didn't own the other five acres.\n\nThen, the daughter sold the entire 100 acres to a buyer, even though she only owned 95 acres. The buyer paid a down payment of $25,000 and took out a mortgage for the remaining $75,000, with the property described as 100 acres.\n\nAfter the sale, the farmer came forward and said she owned five acres of the tract. So, the daughter, realizing there was a problem, negotiated with the farmer and paid her $5,000 for the five-acre tract. The farmer gave a quitclaim deed to the buyer, transferring whatever interest she had in the five acres.\n\nBut then, the buyer defaulted on the mortgage, and the daughter foreclosed on the property. She bought it back at the foreclosure sale, and the deed described it as all 100 acres.\n\nNow, the buyer is suing to claim the five-acre tract. The question is, in an action to determine the title to those five acres, will the buyer win or lose?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Lose, because the daughter didn't have good and marketable title at the time she conveyed the 100 acres to the buyer.\n\nWell, that seems plausible. The daughter only owned 95 acres when she sold 100 acres, so she couldn't convey clear title to the entire 100 acres.\n\nB. Lose, because the doctrine of after-acquired title controls.\n\nHmm, the doctrine of after-acquired title generally means that if a grantee acquires additional title to the property after the original conveyance, that title passes to the original grantee. But in this case, the daughter acquired the five acres after selling the property to the buyer. Wait, but she acquired it and then passed it to the buyer via the quitclaim deed. Maybe that's relevant.\n\nC. Win, because the deed from the farmer to the buyer was a quitclaim deed.\n\nQuitclaim deeds transfer whatever interest the grantor has, but they don't guarantee clear title. So, the buyer gets whatever interest the farmer had, but it doesn't protect against future claims.\n\nD. Win, because the quitclaim deed from the farmer to the buyer was subsequent to the deed from the daughter to the buyer and to the mortgage.\n\nThis suggests that since the quitclaim deed was after the original sale and the mortgage, it might affect the title in some way.\n\nLet me think about this. The daughter sold the property to the buyer, including the five acres she didn't own. Then, she acquired the five acres from the farmer and passed them to the buyer via a quitclaim deed. Later, the buyer defaulted on the mortgage, and the daughter foreclosed and bought back the property, still described as 100 acres.\n\nNow, who has the title to the five acres? The buyer is claiming it, but the daughter foreclosed and bought back the property, which included the five acres.\n\nI think the key here is the after-acquired title doctrine. If the daughter conveyed all her interest in the 100 acres to the buyer, including any interest she might acquire in the future, then when she bought the five acres from the farmer, that interest passed to the buyer automatically.\n\nBut, in this case, she acquired the five acres after selling the property to the buyer and then specifically conveyed that five acres to the buyer via a quitclaim deed. So, it seems like she intentionally conveyed it after realizing the mistake.\n\nHowever, since she conveyed it via a quitclaim deed, which only transfers whatever interest she had, and doesn't provide any warranty against defects in title, the buyer might still be vulnerable to claims from others.\n\nBut, in this scenario, the daughter foreclosed on the mortgage and bought back the property, which included the five acres that were quitclaimed to the buyer. So, does that affect the buyer's claim to the five acres?\n\nI think the answer is that the buyer will lose because the daughter did not have good and marketable title at the time she conveyed the 100 acres to the buyer. The daughter only owned 95 acres when she sold 100 acres, so the buyer didn't get clear title to the entire 100 acres.\n\nMoreover, even though the daughter later acquired the five acres and conveyed them to the buyer via a quitclaim deed, that doesn't necessarily mean the buyer has a better claim than the daughter did originally. The quitclaim deed only transfers whatever interest the farmer had, which was presumably good title to the five acres, but it doesn't cure any defects in the original conveyance from the daughter to the buyer.\n\nAdditionally, when the buyer defaulted on the mortgage, and the daughter foreclosed and bought back the property, that likely wiped out any separate interest the buyer had in the five acres.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is A: lose, because the daughter did not have good and marketable title at the time she purported to convey the 100-acre tract to the buyer.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe the doctrine of after-acquired title applies here, which would mean that when the daughter acquired the five acres from the farmer, that interest passed to the buyer automatically because of the earlier conveyance. However, in this scenario, the daughter acquired the five acres after selling the property to the buyer and then specifically conveyed them via a quitclaim deed. So, perhaps the after-acquired title doctrine doesn't apply directly.\n\nAlso, the fact that the daughter foreclosed on the mortgage and bought back the property might have merged any separate interests, meaning that the five acres and the 95 acres are now reunited under the daughter's ownership.\n\nTherefore, in an action to determine the title to the five-acre tract, the buyer will likely lose because the daughter did not have good and marketable title to the entire 100 acres at the time of the conveyance to the buyer.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
