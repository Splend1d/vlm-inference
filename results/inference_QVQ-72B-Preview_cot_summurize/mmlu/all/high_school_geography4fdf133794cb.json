                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about Burgess's concentric zone model. The question is asking in which zone I would find better houses, single-family homes, and higher-rent apartments. The options are Zone A, B, C, or D. But I think the zones are usually numbered from one to four, so maybe A is Zone One, B is Zone Two, and so on.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Burgess's concentric zone model is all about. I remember that it's a model of urban structure that was proposed by Ernest Burgess in the 1920s. It suggests that cities grow in a series of circles, or zones, outward from the central business district (CBD). Each zone has its own characteristics and land uses.\n\nLet me list out the zones as I remember them:\n\n1. Central Business District (CBD): This is the innermost zone, where most of the commercial activities are concentrated. It's the heart of the city with offices, retailers, and often has higher land values.\n\n2. Transition Zone: This zone surrounds the CBD and is typically characterized by mixed-use areas, possibly including warehouses, light industry, and higher-density housing like apartments. It might also have some older residential buildings that have been converted for other uses.\n\n3. Zone of Working-Family Homes: This is usually the next ring out. It's where the majority of the city's residents live in single-family homes. These areas are often more stable and may have better-quality housing compared to the inner zones.\n\n4. Commuters' Zone: The outermost zone consists of residential areas where people who work in the city but prefer more space and possibly lower housing costs choose to live. They commute into the city for work.\n\nGiven this, the question is asking in which zone I would find better houses, single-family homes, and higher-rent apartments. Let's consider each option:\n\nA. First Zone: This is the CBD. While it might have some high-end apartments or luxury condos, the primary focus is on commercial activities. It's not typically a zone dominated by single-family homes or higher-rent apartments in the way described.\n\nB. Second Zone: The Transition Zone. This area is more mixed, with possibly some higher-density housing, but it's not known for having better houses or single-family homes. It might have some higher-rent apartments, but again, not in the context of better houses.\n\nC. Third Zone: The Zone of Working-Family Homes. This sounds promising. It's where working families live in single-family homes, which suggests that the housing quality is better, and it's a more desirable area to live in compared to the inner zones.\n\nD. Fourth Zone: The Commuters' Zone. This is the outermost zone, with residential areas for people who commute into the city. While there might be single-family homes here, the question specifies \"better houses, single-family homes, and higher-rent apartments.\" It's possible that this zone has higher-rent apartments due to their proximity to green spaces or other amenities, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nI need to think about which zone would have a combination of better houses, single-family homes, and higher-rent apartments. The Third Zone, the Zone of Working-Family Homes, seems to fit the description of having better houses and single-family homes. As for higher-rent apartments, perhaps some of these zones might have apartment buildings that cater to higher-income residents.\n\nHowever, the Fourth Zone, the Commuters' Zone, might also have higher-rent apartments, especially if they offer more luxurious amenities or are located near convenient transportation links for commuting into the city.\n\nBut the key part of the question is \"better houses, single-family homes, and higher-rent apartments.\" Since the Third Zone is specifically described as the Zone of Working-Family Homes, which implies single-family homes of higher quality, and possibly some higher-rent apartments, it seems like the most fitting answer.\n\nThe First and Second Zones are more oriented towards commercial activities and mixed-use development, whereas the Fourth Zone is more about residential living for commuters, possibly with larger homes and more space, but not necessarily characterized by higher-rent apartments.\n\nTherefore, I would say that the Third Zone is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
