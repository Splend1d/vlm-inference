                    "text": "Let's dive into this legal conundrum. So, we have an ex-con who's just been released from prison. He approaches two guys and pitches a bank robbery. Both agree, and the ex-con starts planning. Part of his plan involves stealing a van to use as the getaway car. He's supposed to pick up the two guys in this van on Friday morning and drive them to the bank. His role is to wait in the van while the other two go inside, armed with shotguns.\n\nBut here's the twist: the day before the robbery, the ex-con gets arrested for carrying a concealed weapon, which is a parole violation. He's taken into custody, so he can't be part of the robbery on Friday. Despite that, the two guys decide to go through with the robbery using the van the ex-con stole. On Friday morning, they drive to the bank, but an undercover cop is waiting for them inside and arrests them on the spot, thanks to an anonymous tip.\n\nNow, the question is: what crimes should the ex-con be found guilty of? The options are:\n\nA. Automobile theft and solicitation.\n\nB. Automobile theft and conspiracy.\n\nC. Automobile theft and attempted robbery.\n\nD. Automobile theft, conspiracy, and attempted robbery.\n\nFirst things first, let's break down the ex-con's actions and see which crimes he actually committed.\n\n1. **Automobile Theft:** It's clear that the ex-con stole a van to use as the getaway vehicle. So, he's guilty of automobile theft. That's pretty straightforward.\n\n2. **Solicitation:** Solicitation involves encouraging or requesting someone to commit a crime. The ex-con approached two men and asked them to participate in the bank robbery. That sounds like solicitation.\n\n3. **Conspiracy:** Conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime, along with some overt act in furtherance of that agreement. The ex-con planned the robbery, involved two others, and took steps like stealing a van. Even though he didn't carry out the robbery himself, his involvement in planning and preparing for it could be considered conspiracy.\n\n4. **Attempted Robbery:** Attempted robbery involves taking substantial steps towards committing a robbery but failing to complete it. The ex-con planned the robbery and stole a van for it, but he didn't actually participate in the robbery itself because he was arrested. However, his actions were directed towards committing the robbery.\n\nNow, considering these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Automobile theft and solicitation: He did steal the van and solicit others to commit the robbery, but is that all?\n\nB. Automobile theft and conspiracy: He did steal the van and conspired with others to rob a bank. But did he attempt the robbery?\n\nC. Automobile theft and attempted robbery: He stole the van and took steps towards the robbery, but he didn't personally attempt the robbery since he was arrested.\n\nD. All of the above: Automobile theft, conspiracy, and attempted robbery.\n\nHere's where it gets tricky. The ex-con planned the robbery, stole the van, and involved others. He intended to be the getaway driver but was arrested before the day of the robbery. The two men went ahead with the robbery using the van he stole, but he wasn't directly involved in the execution.\n\nIn legal terms, conspiracy is about agreeing to commit a crime and taking steps towards it, regardless of whether the crime is actually completed. So, even though the ex-con wasn't present during the robbery, his role in planning and preparing could make him guilty of conspiracy.\n\nAs for attempted robbery, since he took substantial steps towards the commission of the crime but didn't complete it (because of his arrest), he might be guilty of attempted robbery.\n\nHowever, some might argue that because he was arrested and couldn't participate, his involvement in the attempted robbery is less direct. But in many jurisdictions, if you've taken steps that go beyond just preparing and are closely related to the execution of the crime, you can be charged with attempt.\n\nOn the other hand, solicitation is different because it's just about encouraging someone to commit a crime, without necessarily agreeing to participate or taking steps to carry it out.\n\nGiven that, I think the ex-con is guilty of automobile theft, conspiracy, and attempted robbery.\n\nWait a minute, but option D includes all three: automobile theft, conspiracy, and attempted robbery. That seems comprehensive.\n\nHowever, option B only includes automobile theft and conspiracy, which might also be valid if you consider that his involvement in the attempted robbery is through conspiracy.\n\nBut I think attempted robbery is a separate charge because he personally took steps towards committing the robbery, even if he didn't carry it out.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If the ex-con had been arrested before any substantial steps were taken towards the robbery, would he still be guilty of attempted robbery? Probably not. But in this case, he stole the van and planned the robbery, which are substantial steps.\n\nMoreover, even though he was arrested, the robbery went ahead using the resources he provided. So, his actions were integral to the attempted robbery.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D: automobile theft, conspiracy, and attempted robbery.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
