Let's go through them one by one.\n\nOption A says that learning is the result of a variety of experiences that temporarily shape behavior. Hmm, but I thought learning was about long-term changes, not just temporary ones. If something only temporarily shapes behavior, maybe it's more of a short-term effect rather than learning. So, maybe this isn't the best definition.\n\nOption B defines learning as an enduring change in an organism's behavior based on experience. This sounds more like what I remember about learning. It's about making lasting changes in how we behave because of what we've experienced. So, this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOption C says that learning is the sole result of classical and operant conditioning. Well, classical and operant conditioning are definitely important parts of learning, but I don't think they're the only ways we learn. There are other types of learning, like observational learning or learning through problem-solving, that don't fit neatly into these two categories. So, this seems too narrow.\n\nOption D talks about the association of experiences due to their occurrence in close proximity. This sounds a bit like classical conditioning, where if two things happen close together, we might learn to associate them. But again, this seems limited to one type of learning and doesn't capture the full scope of what learning is.\n\nComparing all these options, B seems to be the most comprehensive and accurate definition. It doesn't limit learning to specific types or mechanisms, but rather emphasizes that learning is an enduring change in behavior based on experience. That makes sense because learning can happen in many different ways, not just through conditioning, and it should lead to lasting changes in how we act.\n\nI think the answer is B. An enduring change in an organism's behavior based on experience.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
