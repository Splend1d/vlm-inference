                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Decker sold his principal residence for $500,000 after all selling expenses. He bought it 15 years ago for $200,000 and lived in it until he sold it. Within six months, he bought a new house for $600,000. We need to figure out how much gain he should recognize from the sale of his old house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"gain\" means in this context. Gain is basically the profit he made from selling the house, which is the selling price minus the original purchase price. So, gain would be $500,000 minus $200,000, which is $300,000. But wait, there's probably more to it than that.\n\nI recall that there are tax rules regarding the sale of a principal residence. For example, in the United States, under certain conditions, a single taxpayer can exclude up to $250,000 of capital gains from the sale of a principal residence. If Decker meets the eligibility requirements, he might not have to pay tax on the full $300,000 gain.\n\nLet me check the eligibility criteria. Generally, to qualify for the exclusion, the taxpayer must have owned and lived in the home for at least two out of the five years before the sale. Since Decker bought the house 15 years ago and lived in it until he sold it, he should easily meet this requirement.\n\nSo, as a single taxpayer, he can exclude up to $250,000 of capital gains. That means he doesn't have to recognize $250,000 of the gain. But his total gain is $300,000, so $300,000 minus $250,000 would be $50,000 that he would have to recognize.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says \"What amount of gain should Decker recognize from the sale of the residence?\" So, according to this calculation, it should be $50,000. But let's make sure there aren't other factors at play.\n\nThe problem mentions that within six months, Decker purchased a new house for $600,000. Does this have any impact on the gain recognition? I know that in the past, if you bought a new principal residence within a certain period, you could defer the capital gains, but I think that rule has changed.\n\nLet me double-check. In the current tax laws, the exclusion of $250,000 for single taxpayers is based on meeting the ownership and use tests, and it's a one-time exclusion every two years. Buying a new house doesn't directly affect the gain exclusion unless there are specific circumstances I'm not aware of.\n\nSo, perhaps the purchase of the new house isn't relevant to the gain recognition on the old house, at least in terms of the exclusion.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this. Maybe I should consider the net proceeds from the sale. The house sold for $500,000 after expenses, and the basis is $200,000, so the gain is indeed $300,000. Then, the exclusion reduces the recognizable gain by $250,000, leaving $50,000 to be recognized.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any possibility of a larger exclusion or another deduction. Since Decker is single, the $250,000 exclusion seems to be the standard. Unless there are special circumstances, I don't think he qualifies for a higher exclusion.\n\nAlso, the fact that he purchased a new house for $600,000 might be relevant if we're considering whether he can exclude the full gain, but as far as I know, that's not the case. The exclusion is limited to $250,000 for single taxpayers.\n\nLet me think about the timing. He sold the house and bought a new one within six months. Maybe there's a rule that allows for a rollover of gains if the new house is more expensive, but again, I don't think that's how the current tax laws work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to trick me into thinking that because he bought a more expensive house, he doesn't have to recognize any gain. But that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe if the new house is more expensive, there's some kind of adjustment, but I really don't think that's the case. The exclusion is based on the sale of the old house and the taxpayer's filing status, not on the purchase of the new house.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nA. $0\n\nB. $50,000\n\nC. $175,000\n\nD. $300,000\n\nOption B seems to align with my initial calculation: $300,000 gain minus $250,000 exclusion equals $50,000 recognizable gain.\n\nBut let's make sure there isn't something I'm missing. Maybe there's a different way to calculate the exclusion or perhaps there are other deductions that could apply.\n\nFor instance, if Decker had made significant improvements to the house that increased its basis, that could affect the gain. But the problem states that the cost basis is $200,000, so I assume that any improvements are already accounted for in that figure.\n\nAlso, if he had any unrecovered depreciation or something like that, but again, the problem gives the cost basis as $200,000, so I think we can take that at face value.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the fact that he purchased a new house within six months allows him to defer the gain entirely, making the recognizable gain $0. But that seems contrary to the current tax laws, which, as I understand, don't have a deferral provision based on purchasing a new residence.\n\nI think the correct answer is B. $50,000.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of a different interpretation.\n\nSuppose that because he bought a new house within six months, there's some kind of exclusion or deferral that allows him to exclude more than $250,000. But I can't find any current tax regulations that support that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is testing whether I remember that the exclusion is per taxpayer, and since he's single, $250,000 is the limit.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different exclusion amount if certain conditions are met, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps if he used the proceeds from the sale to buy a new house, there's no gain to recognize. But again, that's not in line with current tax laws.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The straightforward calculation is:\n\nGain = Selling price ($500,000) - Adjusted basis ($200,000) = $300,000\n\nExclusion = $250,000 (for single taxpayers)\n\nRecognizable gain = $300,000 - $250,000 = $50,000\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. $50,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
