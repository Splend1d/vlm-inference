                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this logic problem. It says, \"Another name for the fallacy of complex question is...\" and then there are four options: A. Fallacy of interrogation, B. Compound proposition, C. Appeal to ignorance, D. Extension. Hmm, I need to recall what a complex question fallacy is and then match it with the correct term from these options.\n\nFirst, I remember that a complex question is a type of logical fallacy where a question is asked in such a way that it assumes something that hasn't been proven or accepted yet. It's like embedding an assumption within the question that might not be true or agreed upon by everyone involved. For example, if someone asks, \"When did you stop beating your wife?\" this question assumes that you have beaten your wife at some point, which might not be the case. So, the question itself is problematic because it contains a hidden assumption.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Fallacy of interrogation: This sounds related to questions, but I'm not sure if it's specifically about complex questions. Maybe it's a general term for fallacies involving questions.\n\nB. Compound proposition: This seems to refer to something in logic where propositions are combined using logical connectives like \"and\" or \"or.\" But I don't think this directly relates to the complex question fallacy.\n\nC. Appeal to ignorance: I think this is a different fallacy where someone claims that something is true because it hasn't been proven false, or vice versa. For example, saying \"There must be ghosts because no one has proven they don't exist.\" That's not related to complex questions.\n\nD. Extension: This term is a bit vague. In logic, extension usually refers to the set of things to which a term applies, like the extension of the term \"dog\" would be the set of all dogs. I don't see how this directly relates to complex questions.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe I should look up the formal name for the complex question fallacy. I recall that it's also known as \"begging the question\" in a broader sense, but that's not one of the options. Wait, \"begging the question\" is actually a different fallacy, where an argument's premise assumes the conclusion, so that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, I think the complex question fallacy is sometimes called \"loaded question fallacy\" or \"complex question.\" But none of these are listed in the options. Maybe the term \"fallacy of interrogation\" fits, as it seems to relate to questions and potentially to fallacies involving questions.\n\nLet me consider the definition of each option:\n\nA. Fallacy of interrogation: This seems to refer to fallacies that occur in the form of questions. The complex question fallacy is specifically about questions that contain unwarranted assumptions, so this could be a category that includes complex questions.\n\nB. Compound proposition: This is more about combining simple propositions into more complex ones using logical operators. Not directly related to questions or fallacies involving assumptions in questions.\n\nC. Appeal to ignorance: This is about assuming something is true because it hasn't been proven false, or vice versa. Again, not related to complex questions.\n\nD. Extension: This term refers to the range or scope of something, like the extension of a concept, which doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nGiven this, option A, fallacy of interrogation, seems the most relevant because it relates to fallacies in the form of questions, which would include complex questions.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider that the complex question fallacy is also known as \"many questions fallacy\" or \"complex question.\" But again, none of these are in the options. Perhaps the term \"fallacy of interrogation\" is used to describe fallacies that involve questions, including complex questions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D. Extension, but that seems unlikely because extension refers to the scope of a concept, not to fallacies in questioning.\n\nI think the best answer is A. Fallacy of interrogation, as it seems to capture the nature of fallacies involving questions, including complex questions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
