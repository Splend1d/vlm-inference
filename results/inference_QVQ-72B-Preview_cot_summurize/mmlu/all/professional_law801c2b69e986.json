                    "text": "So I've got this situation here involving Bob Wilson, Ted Lamar, and Pete Smith. Bob borrowed $20,000 from Ted to open a hardware store. Ted's only involvement was lending the money; he wasn't part of the business operations. But Bob was thankful and named the store \"Wilson and Lamar Hardware,\" and even put both their names on the stationery as partners. When Ted found out, he was touched and lowered the interest rate on the loan.\n\nNow, Pete Smith, who didn't know the actual arrangement, sold goods to the hardware store, thinking both Bob and Ted were partners. But now Pete can't collect payment for those goods, and he's seeking advice on who he can hold liable for the debt.\n\nLet me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst, Bob borrowed money from Ted to open the store. Ted is just a lender; he doesn't have any active role in the business. Bob, in gratitude, names the store \"Wilson and Lamar Hardware\" and represents both of them as partners on the stationery. Ted, feeling flattered, reduces the interest rate on the loan.\n\nThen, Pete Smith, unaware of the actual relationship between Bob and Ted, sells goods to the store, thinking both are partners. Now, Pete can't collect payment and wants to know who is responsible.\n\nSo, the question is about the liability of Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar for the debt owed to Pete Smith.\n\nLet me consider the legal aspects here. In general, partnerships are governed by partnership laws, which vary by jurisdiction, but generally, in a partnership, each partner is liable for the debts of the partnership.\n\nHowever, in this case, Ted Lamar is not actually a partner in the business operations. He's just a lender. Bob Wilson, without Ted's consent, represented Ted as a partner in the business.\n\nThis seems like a case of apparent authority or holding out. That is, Bob held Ted out to the public as a partner, which might have led Pete to believe that Ted was indeed a partner.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, if someone is held out as a partner, even if they're not actually a partner, they may be liable for the debts of the partnership to third parties who relied on that representation.\n\nBut let's think about this more carefully.\n\nBob Wilson borrowed money from Ted Lamar and started a business. Ted had no involvement in the business except for lending the money. Bob, out of gratitude, named the store \"Wilson and Lamar Hardware\" and represented Ted as a partner on the stationery.\n\nTed, upon finding out about this, was flattered and reduced the interest rate on the loan. So, Ted didn't object to being represented as a partner and even took a favorable action based on that representation.\n\nNow, Pete Smith, believing that both Bob and Ted were partners, sold goods to the store. Pete is now unable to collect payment for those goods and is seeking advice on who is liable for the debt.\n\nOption A says only Bob Wilson is liable.\n\nOption B says both Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar are jointly liable.\n\nOption C says Bob Wilson is liable for the entire amount, and Ted Lamar is liable only if the debt can't be collected from Bob Wilson.\n\nOption D says only the de facto partnership arising from the relationship between Wilson and Lamar is liable.\n\nFirst, let's consider whether Ted Lamar is actually a partner.\n\nFrom the information provided, Ted Lamar was only a lender, with no interest in the business beyond getting repaid. Bob Wilson, without Ted's explicit consent, represented Ted as a partner.\n\nHowever, Ted found out about this representation and didn't object; instead, he reduced the interest rate on the loan. This could be seen as implicit acceptance or ratification of the representation.\n\nIn partnership law, if someone is held out to the public as a partner, and third parties rely on that representation, that person may be liable as a partner even if they didn't intend to be one.\n\nSo, in this case, Pete Smith relied on the representation that Ted Lamar was a partner when he sold goods to the store.\n\nTherefore, Ted Lamar might be liable for the debt to Pete Smith, even though he wasn't actually a partner in the business operations.\n\nOn the other hand, Bob Wilson is definitely a partner since he was the one running the business.\n\nSo, both Bob and Ted might be liable jointly for the debt.\n\nBut let's look at option C: Bob is liable for the entire amount, and Ted is liable only if the debt can't be collected from Bob.\n\nThis sounds like Ted has limited liability, which isn't typically the case in a general partnership. In a general partnership, all partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts of the partnership. That means creditors can go after any partner for the full amount of the debt.\n\nHowever, if Ted was not actually a partner but was only being held out as one, his liability might be different.\n\nBut in this scenario, since Ted didn't object to being represented as a partner and even acted in a way that affirmed the representation (by reducing the interest rate), it's likely that he can be held liable as a partner.\n\nTherefore, option B seems the most accurate: both Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar are liable jointly.\n\nOption D mentions a \"de facto partnership.\" I'm not entirely sure about the exact meaning in this context, but generally, a de facto partnership might refer to a situation where, despite not having a formal partnership agreement, the actions of the parties suggest a partnership exists.\n\nIn this case, while Ted didn't have an active role in the business, his representation as a partner and his failure to correct that representation might lead to the conclusion that a de facto partnership exists.\n\nHowever, I think option B is clearer and more directly applicable.\n\nOption A says only Bob Wilson is liable, but that doesn't seem right because of the representation that Ted was a partner.\n\nOption C suggests that Ted is only secondarily liable, which contradicts the general principle of joint and several liability in partnerships.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is option B: Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar are liable jointly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
