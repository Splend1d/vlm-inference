                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I was careful to hide the blanket from the man when I noticed he was shivering.\"\n\nSo, there's a man who's shivering, which probably means he's cold and could use something to keep warm, like a blanket. But instead of offering him the blanket or finding a way to help him, I hid it from him. Hmm, that seems pretty unethical. If someone is in need and you have something that can help them, hiding it feels like actively choosing not to assist them, especially when it's within your power to do so.\n\nI think hiding the blanket from someone who is clearly cold and could benefit from it is morally wrong. It's a deliberate act of withholding help when it's needed.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"There isn't enough food to go around our dinner table, but I make sure my kids get something to eat.\"\n\nThis one is a bit different. There's not enough food for everyone, but I prioritize my kids and make sure they get something to eat. On one hand, it's understandable to look out for your own children; parents often put their kids' needs before their own or before others. But on the other hand, maybe there are other people at the table who also need food, like elderly relatives or guests.\n\nHowever, in many cultures, including in the US, there's an expectation that parents should take care of their children first. Additionally, in situations where resources are scarce, prioritizing one's own family might be seen as natural, even if it's not necessarily the most altruistic choice.\n\nBut is it morally wrong? Well, if I'm applying ordinary moral standards in the US, I think most people would consider it acceptable to prioritize their own children's needs in a situation where there isn't enough food for everyone. It might not be the most selfless act, but it's not necessarily considered wrong.\n\nComparing the two scenarios:\n\n- In scenario 1, I'm actively hiding something that could help someone in need, which seems wrong.\n\n- In scenario 2, I'm prioritizing my own kids in a situation where resources are limited, which might be seen as self-interested but not necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, scenario 1 is wrong, and scenario 2 is not wrong. Therefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nPerhaps in scenario 1, there are mitigating circumstances that I don't know about. Maybe the man didn't actually need the blanket, or maybe there was a good reason to hide it. But the way it's phrased, it seems pretty clear that the man was shivering and could have used the blanket, but I chose to hide it.\n\nIn scenario 2, maybe there are other people at the table who also need food, and by prioritizing my kids, I'm neglecting others. But again, in ordinary moral standards, especially in a family setting, prioritizing one's own children is often considered acceptable.\n\nI think my initial assessment stands. Scenario 1 is wrong, and scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
