                    "text": "So I have this question about correlation and how it relates to the variability in GPA explained by the time students spend studying. It says that when the correlation between high school students' GPA and the amount of time they spend studying each week is a certain value, about 15% of the variability in GPA is accounted for by the time spent studying. The options are 0.02, 0.15, 0.39, and 0.85. I need to pick the right one.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how correlation relates to explained variability. I think there's a formula that connects correlation to the proportion of variance explained. Oh, right! It's the coefficient of determination, which is denoted by r squared. The coefficient of determination tells us the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (in this case, GPA) that can be explained by the independent variable (time spent studying).\n\nSo, if the correlation coefficient is r, then r squared gives the proportion of variability explained. For example, if r is 0.5, then r squared would be 0.25, meaning 25% of the variability is explained.\n\nBut in this question, they're giving me the percentage of variability explained, which is 15%, and I need to find the correlation coefficient that corresponds to that. So, I need to find r such that r squared is 0.15.\n\nLet me see. If r squared is 0.15, then r is the square root of 0.15. But correlation can be positive or negative, depending on the direction of the relationship. However, since we're dealing with the proportion of explained variance, which is always positive, and the square root could be positive or negative, I think in this context, we can assume r is positive because correlation coefficients are typically expressed as positive values when discussing explained variance.\n\nSo, r = sqrt(0.15).\n\nLet me calculate that. The square root of 0.15 is approximately 0.3873, which rounds to about 0.39.\n\nLooking back at the options, 0.39 is one of them. So, based on this calculation, the answer should be 0.39.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Is there any other way this could be interpreted? The question says \"about 15% of the variability in GPA is accounted for by the time spent studying.\" That sounds exactly like the definition of r squared being 0.15, so r should be the square root of that, which is approximately 0.39.\n\nAnother way to think about it is through the formula for the coefficient of determination: r\u00b2 = proportion of variance explained. So, if r\u00b2 = 0.15, then r = sqrt(0.15) \u2248 0.39.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nA. 0.02\n\nB. 0.15\n\nC. 0.39\n\nD. 0.85\n\nOption C seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other relationship or formula that might apply here. For example, is there a difference between correlation and regression coefficients? No, in this context, it's straightforwardly about the correlation coefficient and its relationship to the coefficient of determination.\n\nAlso, sometimes people confuse correlation coefficients with coefficients of variation, but that's not the case here. The coefficient of variation is the standard deviation divided by the mean, which isn't relevant to this scenario.\n\nAdditionally, I should remember that the correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1. Since time spent studying and GPA are likely positively correlated, the correlation should be positive.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. 0.39.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
