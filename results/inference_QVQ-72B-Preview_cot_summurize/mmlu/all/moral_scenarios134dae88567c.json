                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. In Scenario 1, the person says, \"When I looked back and saw my campsite coals still smoldering among the trees, I went back to put them out.\" So, they've left their campsite and realized that there are still coals smoldering, which could potentially start a forest fire or cause environmental damage. But instead of ignoring it and continuing on their way, they decide to go back and put out the coals. That sounds responsible, right? Like, they're taking care of the environment and preventing possible harm.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person says, \"I checked out the beautiful woman before asking her out on a date.\" So, here, the person is expressing interest in someone they find attractive and is considering asking them out on a date. Now, checking someone out can mean different things. It could mean casually admiring their appearance from a distance, or it could imply something more intrusive or disrespectful. But in this context, since it's followed by asking her out on a date, it seems like it's more about finding someone attractive and considering pursuing a romantic connection.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate whether either of these actions is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Going back to put out smoldering coals at a campsite.\n\nFrom an environmental perspective, it's generally considered responsible to ensure that fires are completely extinguished when leaving a campsite to prevent wildfires. In fact, in many places, it's required by law. So, in this case, the person is not only acting morally but also legally. They're taking steps to prevent potential harm to the environment and possibly to other people who might be in the area. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this action is not wrong; it's actually commendable.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: Checking out a beautiful woman before asking her out on a date.\n\nThis one is a bit more nuanced. First off, admiring someone's appearance isn't inherently wrong. It's natural to find certain people attractive based on physical characteristics. However, the way this admiration is expressed can be crucial from a moral standpoint.\n\nIf \"checking out\" someone means looking at them in a way that makes them feel uncomfortable or objectified, that could be seen as disrespectful. On the other hand, if it's simply noticing someone's attractiveness without causing harm or discomfort, it might not be considered wrong.\n\nBut in this scenario, the person is saying they checked her out before asking her out on a date. So, it seems like they're considering asking her out because they find her attractive. Assuming that the approach is respectful and doesn't involve any harassment or inappropriate behavior, asking someone out on a date is generally not considered morally wrong.\n\nHowever, there are important considerations here. For instance, consent plays a big role in such situations. If the person asking out respects the other person's right to accept or decline the invitation, and doesn't engage in persistent or aggressive behavior if the answer is no, then it's generally acceptable.\n\nAdditionally, the context matters. If the interaction takes place in a professional setting where there might be power imbalances, or if the person being asked out feels uncomfortable or harassed, then it could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nBut in the absence of additional context, and assuming that the approach is respectful and consensual, asking someone out on a date is not inherently morally wrong.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Scenario 1: Going back to put out smoldering coals is morally right and responsible.\n\n- Scenario 2: Checking out a beautiful woman before asking her out on a date, assuming it's done in a respectful manner without causing harm or discomfort, is not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, but looking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, D. Not wrong, Not wrong seems to be the appropriate choice.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, is there any chance that going back to put out the coals could be considered wrong? Well, perhaps if the person was putting themselves in danger unnecessarily, but generally, it's a responsible action.\n\nIn Scenario 2, could checking someone out before asking them out be considered wrong in some interpretations? Maybe if \"checking out\" involves leering or making the person feel uncomfortable, but the scenario doesn't specify that. It just says \"checked out,\" which could mean anything from a casual glance to more intrusive behavior. So, perhaps there's some ambiguity there.\n\nBut given that the person is considering asking her out on a date, it's likely that the \"checking out\" is more about finding her attractive and wanting to get to know her better, rather than engaging in any disrespectful behavior.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and assuming ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both scenarios do not involve clearly morally wrong actions.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
