                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out how metal detectors at airports work, and which law they're operating under. The options are Ohm's law, Faraday's law, Coulomb's law, and Newton's laws. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that metal detectors are used to find metal inclusions hidden beneath the surface or inside other objects. At airports, they're used to detect any metallic items that might pose a security risk. But how do they actually detect metal?\n\nI recall that metal detectors use electromagnetic fields. When you walk through one, there's a transmitter coil that sends out an electromagnetic field. If there's a piece of metal in that field, it creates eddy currents in the metal, which in turn produce their own magnetic fields. These fields interfere with the original field, and the detector senses this change, alerting that there's metal present.\n\nSo, this sounds like it's related to electromagnetism, specifically induction. Let me recall Faraday's law. Faraday's law of induction states that any change in the magnetic flux through a conductor will induce an electromotive force (EMF) in the conductor. If the conductor is not a closed loop, then an electric current will not flow, but if it is, then a current will flow, and it will set up its own magnetic field opposing the change that induced it. This isLenz's law.\n\nIn the context of a metal detector, the changing magnetic field from the transmitter coil induces eddy currents in any nearby metal objects, which then create their own magnetic fields that affect the detector's receiver coil. So, this seems directly related to Faraday's law.\n\nNow, let's consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOhm's law relates voltage, current, and resistance in a DC circuit. It states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, and inversely proportional to the resistance between them. While Ohm's law is fundamental in electronics, it doesn't directly explain how metal detectors work, which involve changing magnetic fields and induction.\n\nCoulomb's law describes the force between two point charges. It's a fundamental law in electrostatics. Since metal detectors involve moving charges (electric currents) and magnetic fields, Coulomb's law isn't directly applicable here.\n\nNewton's laws govern classical mechanics, dealing with forces, masses, and accelerations. They don't relate to electromagnetic phenomena.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, Faraday's law seems to be the most relevant here. It explains the induction of eddy currents in metal objects and how those currents produce magnetic fields that can be detected.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check if there's any other law or principle that might also be at play here. For example, could there be any magnetic properties of metals that might be detected through other means?\n\nWell, some metals are ferromagnetic, like iron, and have strong magnetic properties. But the metal detector should work with non-ferromagnetic metals as well, like copper or aluminum, by inducing eddy currents in them. So, while ferromagnetic materials might be detected differently, the basic principle still revolves around electromagnetic induction.\n\nAlso, I remember that metal detectors can be of different types, like low-frequency induction (LFI), very-low-frequency (VLF), and pulse induction (PI). But in all these types, the fundamental principle is still electromagnetic induction, which again points back to Faraday's law.\n\nLet me think about the process again: the transmitter coil generates an alternating magnetic field. If there's metal in this field, eddy currents are induced in the metal, which then generate their own magnetic fields that interfere with the original field. This change is detected by the receiver coil, which is connected to a circuit that can interpret these changes and trigger an alarm or indication.\n\nThis process is clearly based on mutual induction between the transmitter and receiver coils, mediated by the presence of metal, which is a direct application of Faraday's law.\n\nI don't think Ohm's law, Coulomb's law, or Newton's laws directly account for this phenomenon, although Ohm's law might be involved in the circuit design of the detector itself, but that's secondary to the detection mechanism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Faraday\u2019s law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
