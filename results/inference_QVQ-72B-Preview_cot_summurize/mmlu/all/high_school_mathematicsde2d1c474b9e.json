                    "text": "So I have this problem here: I need to find the probability that a randomly selected integer from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 100} is divisible by 2 but not divisible by 3. And I have to express the answer as a common fraction. There are four options to choose from, but I want to make sure I understand how to get the correct answer.\n\nFirst, I know that probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the total number of possible outcomes is 100, since we're choosing from the first 100 positive integers.\n\nNow, the favorable outcomes are the integers that are divisible by 2 but not divisible by 3. So, I need to find how many numbers between 1 and 100 satisfy these conditions.\n\nLet me start by finding out how many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by 2. Since every even number is divisible by 2, there are exactly half of them, which is 50 numbers.\n\nNext, I need to exclude from these 50 numbers those that are also divisible by 3. So, I need to find how many numbers are divisible by both 2 and 3. The least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 3 is 6, so numbers divisible by both are exactly the multiples of 6.\n\nHow many multiples of 6 are there between 1 and 100? Well, 6 times 16 is 96, which is less than 100, and 6 times 17 is 102, which is greater than 100. So, there are 16 multiples of 6 between 1 and 100.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers that are divisible by 2 but not by 3 is the total divisible by 2 minus those divisible by both 2 and 3. That is, 50 - 16 = 34.\n\nSo, there are 34 numbers that satisfy the condition of being divisible by 2 but not by 3.\n\nNow, the total number of possible outcomes is 100, and the number of favorable outcomes is 34. Therefore, the probability should be 34/100, which simplifies to 17/50.\n\nLet me double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, numbers divisible by 2: 50 numbers.\n\nNumbers divisible by both 2 and 3 (i.e., divisible by 6): 16 numbers.\n\nSo, numbers divisible by 2 but not by 3: 50 - 16 = 34.\n\nTotal numbers: 100.\n\nProbability: 34/100 = 17/50.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 31/66\n\nB. 17/66\n\nC. 17/31\n\nD. 17/50\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion or something else to confirm.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nFirst, find the number of numbers divisible by 2, which is 50, as before.\n\nThen, find the number of numbers divisible by 3 in the entire set of 100 numbers.\n\nDividing 100 by 3 gives 33 with a remainder, so there are 33 multiples of 3 between 1 and 100.\n\nNow, among these 33 multiples of 3, how many are also multiples of 2? As before, multiples of both 2 and 3 are multiples of 6, and there are 16 of them.\n\nSo, the number of multiples of 3 that are not multiples of 2 would be the total multiples of 3 minus the multiples of 6: 33 - 16 = 17.\n\nBut, in this approach, I'm not sure if I need this number right now.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think differently.\n\nI want numbers that are divisible by 2 but not by 3.\n\nSo, the total divisible by 2 is 50.\n\nSubtract those divisible by both 2 and 3, which is 16, to get 34, as before.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of numbers divisible by 2 and not by 3 as the number of numbers divisible by 2 minus the number of numbers divisible by both 2 and 3, which again is 50 - 16 = 34.\n\nSo, again, I arrive at the same number.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the number of favorable outcomes is 34, and the total number of possible outcomes is 100, leading to a probability of 34/100, which simplifies to 17/50.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 17/50 is the correct answer.\n\nI don't see any flaws in this reasoning, so I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ \\dfrac{17}{50}} \\]"
