                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a normally distributed waiting time for a roller coaster ride, with a mean of 35 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes. There are 150,000 riders in the first summer, and we need to find the shortest time interval that corresponds to 100,000 riders. The options are given, and I need to pick the one that covers exactly 100,000 riders.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for the waiting times to be normally distributed. In a normal distribution, the data is symmetrically distributed with the mean at the center. Here, the mean is 35 minutes, so the peak of the distribution is at 35 minutes. The standard deviation is 10 minutes, which tells me how spread out the waiting times are.\n\nSo, with 150,000 riders in total, and we're looking for the interval that covers 100,000 riders, that means we're looking for an interval where 100,000 out of 150,000 riders fall, which is approximately 66.67% of the total riders.\n\nWait, but 100,000 out of 150,000 is indeed 100,000 / 150,000 = 2/3, which is approximately 66.67%. So, we're looking for an interval that covers about 66.67% of the distribution.\n\nIn a normal distribution, certain percentages correspond to specific standard deviations from the mean. For example:\n\n- About 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean.\n\n- About 95% falls within two standard deviations.\n\n- About 99.7% falls within three standard deviations.\n\nSo, if 68% of the data is within one standard deviation, that's from mean -1\u03c3 to mean +1\u03c3, which in this case would be from 25 minutes to 45 minutes (since mean is 35 and \u03c3 is 10).\n\nBut our target is approximately 66.67%, which is slightly less than 68%. So, maybe the interval is a bit narrower than one standard deviation on either side.\n\nBut let's be more precise. To find the exact interval that covers exactly 66.67% of the distribution, we can use the standard normal distribution table or Z-scores.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score that corresponds to 66.67% of the area under the standard normal curve. Since the normal distribution is symmetric, 66.67% would be from the lower 16.67% to the upper 83.33%, or vice versa.\n\nWait, let's think carefully. The total area under the normal curve is 100%, and it's symmetric around the mean. If we want the central 66.67% of the data, that leaves 33.33% in the tails. So, the area in each tail would be 33.33%/2 = 16.665%.\n\nNow, we need to find the Z-score that corresponds to 16.665% in the upper tail, which means the cumulative probability up to that point is 83.335% (100% - 16.665% = 83.335%).\n\nLooking up the Z-score for a cumulative probability of 0.83335 in a standard normal table, I find that it's approximately 1.00.\n\nWait, according to standard normal tables, a Z-score of 1.00 corresponds to about 84.13% cumulative probability, which is slightly higher than 83.335%. Maybe I need a more precise Z-score.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the inverse normal function in a calculator or software to find the exact Z-score for 0.83335.\n\nBut since I don't have access to that right now, I'll approximate that the Z-score is roughly 0.99 or 1.00.\n\nGiven that, the interval would be approximately mean \u00b1 Z*\u03c3, which is 35 \u00b1 1.00*10, so from 25 minutes to 45 minutes.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option C is 25.3 to 44.7 minutes, which is very close to 25 to 45 minutes.\n\nOption A is 0 to 31.7 minutes, which seems too narrow since the mean is 35 minutes.\n\nOption B is 31.7 to 39.3 minutes, which is narrower than the one standard deviation interval.\n\nOption D is 25.3 to 35 minutes, which only covers up to the mean.\n\nSo, option C seems the closest to the one standard deviation interval, but let's double-check.\n\nIf the Z-score is approximately 1.00, then the interval would be from mean - Z*\u03c3 to mean + Z*\u03c3, which is from 35 - 10 to 35 + 10, i.e., 25 to 45 minutes.\n\nBut option C is 25.3 to 44.7 minutes, which is almost the same as 25 to 45 minutes.\n\nOption A is 0 to 31.7 minutes, which would cover from 0 to approximately mean - 0.33\u03c3 (since 35 - 31.7 = 3.3 minutes, and \u03c3 is 10, so 3.3/10 = 0.33\u03c3 below the mean).\n\nOption B is 31.7 to 39.3 minutes, which is from mean - 0.33\u03c3 to mean + 0.43\u03c3 (since 39.3 - 35 = 4.3 minutes).\n\nOption D is 25.3 to 35 minutes, which is from mean - 0.97\u03c3 to mean.\n\nWait, 25.3 is 35 - 9.7 minutes, since 35 - 25.3 = 9.7 minutes, and \u03c3 is 10, so Z = -0.97.\n\nSo, option D covers from mean - 0.97\u03c3 to mean.\n\nOption C covers from mean - 0.97\u03c3 (25.3 minutes) to mean + 0.97\u03c3 (44.7 minutes).\n\nWait, 44.7 minutes is 35 + 9.7 minutes, which is 35 + 0.97\u03c3.\n\nSimilarly, 25.3 is 35 - 9.7 minutes, which is 35 - 0.97\u03c3.\n\nSo, option C covers from mean - 0.97\u03c3 to mean + 0.97\u03c3.\n\nGiven that, and considering that Z=1.00 corresponds to approximately 84.13%, and we need 66.67%, which corresponds to roughly Z=0.99 or 1.00, this seems consistent.\n\nBut let's check the proportion of riders in this interval.\n\nIf the total number of riders is 150,000, and we're looking for the interval that includes 100,000 riders, we need to find the interval where the probability is 100,000 / 150,000 = 2/3 \u2248 0.6667.\n\nSo, we need the interval where the cumulative probability is from, say, 0.16665 to 0.83335.\n\nUsing Z-scores, for a cumulative probability of 0.83335, the Z-score is approximately 0.99.\n\nSimilarly, for 0.16665, the Z-score is approximately -0.99.\n\nTherefore, the interval should be from mean - 0.99\u03c3 to mean + 0.99\u03c3, which is from 35 - 9.9 minutes to 35 + 9.9 minutes, i.e., 25.1 to 44.9 minutes.\n\nOption C is 25.3 to 44.7 minutes, which is very close to this calculation.\n\nOption A, 0 to 31.7 minutes, would cover from 0 to approximately mean - 0.33\u03c3, which is only a portion of the distribution.\n\nOption B, 31.7 to 39.3 minutes, covers from mean - 0.33\u03c3 to mean + 0.43\u03c3, which would be a smaller portion than what we need.\n\nOption D, 25.3 to 35 minutes, covers from mean - 0.97\u03c3 to mean, which is only half of the required interval.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the closest match to the interval that would include exactly 100,000 riders out of 150,000.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders.\" So, among the given options, which one covers exactly 100,000 riders and is the shortest?\n\nOption C is 25.3 to 44.7 minutes, which is a range of 19.4 minutes.\n\nOption A is 0 to 31.7 minutes, which is 31.7 minutes, longer than C.\n\nOption B is 31.7 to 39.3 minutes, which is 7.6 minutes, much shorter than C.\n\nOption D is 25.3 to 35 minutes, which is 9.7 minutes, also shorter than C.\n\nBut based on our earlier calculation, the interval from 25.1 to 44.9 minutes should cover approximately 66.67% of the distribution, which is 100,000 riders out of 150,000.\n\nOption C is very close to that, covering from 25.3 to 44.7 minutes, which is almost the same as 25.1 to 44.9 minutes.\n\nThe other options cover either a smaller or larger portion of the distribution, but none of them would cover exactly 100,000 riders except option C.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option C: 25.3 to 44.7 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
