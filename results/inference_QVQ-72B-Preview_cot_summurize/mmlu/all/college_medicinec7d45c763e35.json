                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem about sound waves moving from one medium to another, and I need to figure out which of these properties\u2014velocity, intensity, frequency, or wavelength\u2014doesn't change when the sound exits the first medium and enters a denser one. The options are A. velocity, B. intensity, C. frequency, D. wavelength, and I need to pick the one that does NOT change.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic principles about sound waves and how they behave when they move from one medium to another, especially if the second medium is denser.\n\nI know that sound waves are mechanical waves that require a medium to travel through. Their speed depends on the properties of the medium, like its density and elasticity. Generally, in denser media, the speed of sound can change because density affects how easily particles can vibrate and transmit the sound.\n\nLet me think about velocity first. If the medium gets denser, does the velocity increase or decrease? I think in gases and liquids, increasing density might increase the speed of sound, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's different for different types of media.\n\nIntensity is another option. Intensity is related to the energy carried by the wave per unit area per unit time. When a wave moves from one medium to another, some of the energy might be reflected, and some transmitted. So, if part of the energy is reflected, the intensity in the new medium might be less. But I'm not sure if that's always the case, especially if the media are very different in density.\n\nFrequency seems like a tricky one. I remember that frequency is related to the source and doesn't usually change when a wave moves from one medium to another. Wait, is that right? Let me think. If I have a sound source emitting at a certain frequency, say, 500 Hz, does that frequency change when the sound enters a different medium? I don't think so. Frequency should stay the same, but I need to confirm that.\n\nWavelength is the last option. Wavelength is the distance between successive crests of the wave. If the velocity changes when the wave enters a new medium, and frequency stays the same, then wavelength should change because wavelength equals velocity divided by frequency. So, if velocity changes and frequency doesn't, wavelength must change accordingly.\n\nLet me summarize what I'm thinking:\n\n- Velocity: depends on the medium's properties, so it might change.\n\n- Intensity: could change due to reflection and absorption at the boundary.\n\n- Frequency: should remain constant, as it's determined by the source.\n\n- Wavelength: changes if velocity changes, assuming frequency is constant.\n\nSo, based on this, the one that doesn't change is frequency. Therefore, the answer should be C. frequency.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is frequency really constant when a wave moves from one medium to another?\n\nI recall that for electromagnetic waves, frequency is constant, but what about sound waves? Are there any differences?\n\nLet me consider the case of light for comparison. When light passes from air into water, its speed decreases because water is denser, and its wavelength decreases, but its frequency remains the same. Similarly, for sound waves, I think the same principle applies. Frequency is set by the source and doesn't change when the medium changes.\n\nSo, in this case, frequency should remain constant, meaning it doesn't change when the sound enters a denser medium.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. frequency.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
