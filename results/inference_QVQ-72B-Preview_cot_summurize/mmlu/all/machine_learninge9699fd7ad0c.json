                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out how many parameters this fully connected neural network has. It's got two hidden layers, with 1000 and 10 activations respectively, and the input is 100-dimensional, with the output being a single scalar for the house price.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure. A fully connected network means that each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer. There are no batch normalization layers or learnable parameters in the activation functions, so I only need to account for the weights and biases in each layer.\n\nSo, starting from the input layer:\n\n- It has 100 features as input.\n\n- The first hidden layer has 1000 neurons.\n\nBetween the input and the first hidden layer, there are 100 * 1000 weights, plus 1000 biases for the neurons in the first hidden layer.\n\nSo that's 100 * 1000 + 1000 = 100,000 + 1,000 = 101,000 parameters for the first hidden layer.\n\nNext, the second hidden layer has 10 neurons.\n\nBetween the first hidden layer (1000 neurons) and the second hidden layer (10 neurons), there are 1000 * 10 weights, plus 10 biases for the neurons in the second hidden layer.\n\nThat's 1000 * 10 + 10 = 10,000 + 10 = 10,010 parameters for the second hidden layer.\n\nFinally, the output layer has a single neuron (the house price), and it's connected to the second hidden layer, which has 10 neurons.\n\nSo, between the second hidden layer and the output layer, there are 10 * 1 weights, plus 1 bias for the output neuron.\n\nThat's 10 * 1 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 parameters for the output layer.\n\nNow, to find the total number of parameters, I need to sum up the parameters from all these connections:\n\nFirst hidden layer: 101,000\n\nSecond hidden layer: 10,010\n\nOutput layer: 11\n\nTotal parameters = 101,000 + 10,010 + 11\n\nLet me add those up:\n\n101,000 + 10,010 = 111,010\n\n111,010 + 11 = 111,021\n\nSo, the total number of parameters is 111,021.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 111021\n\nB. 110010\n\nC. 111110\n\nD. 110011\n\nOption A matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet's go through it again.\n\nFirst hidden layer: 100 inputs * 1000 neurons + 1000 biases = 100,000 + 1,000 = 101,000\n\nSecond hidden layer: 1000 inputs * 10 neurons + 10 biases = 10,000 + 10 = 10,010\n\nOutput layer: 10 inputs * 1 neuron + 1 bias = 10 + 1 = 11\n\nTotal: 101,000 + 10,010 + 11 = 111,021\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think the answer is A. 111021.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
