                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"Write the ratio of 2 cups to 3 quarts as a fraction in simplest form.\" And there are some multiple-choice options: A. 3 over 2, B. 2 over 3, C. 2 over 12, D. 1 over 6.\n\nHmm, I need to find the ratio of 2 cups to 3 quarts. But first, I should probably make sure that both units are the same, right? Because cups and quarts are different units of measurement, and to find the ratio, I need to express them in the same unit.\n\nI know that 1 quart is equal to 4 cups. So, if I have 3 quarts, that means 3 times 4, which is 12 cups. So, 3 quarts is the same as 12 cups.\n\nNow, the ratio of 2 cups to 12 cups is 2 to 12. But that can be simplified.\n\nTo simplify the fraction 2/12, I can divide both the numerator and the denominator by the greatest common divisor of 2 and 12, which is 2.\n\nSo, 2 divided by 2 is 1, and 12 divided by 2 is 6. Therefore, 2/12 simplifies to 1/6.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D is 1 over 6.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nStarting with 2 cups to 3 quarts, I converted quarts to cups because cups are smaller units and more common in cooking contexts.\n\n1 quart is 4 cups, so 3 quarts is 12 cups. So, the ratio is indeed 2 cups to 12 cups.\n\nNow, 2 to 12 can be written as 2/12. To simplify that fraction, I divided both numerator and denominator by 2, which is the greatest common divisor of 2 and 12, and got 1/6.\n\nThat seems correct. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider converting cups to quarts. Since 1 cup is 0.25 quarts (because 1 quart is 4 cups), then 2 cups would be 0.5 quarts.\n\nSo, the ratio would be 0.5 quarts to 3 quarts, which is 0.5 to 3.\n\nAs a fraction, that would be 0.5/3. To express this as a fraction in simplest form, I can multiply numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate the decimal, getting 1/6.\n\nAgain, this confirms that the ratio is 1 to 6, or 1/6 in fractional form.\n\nWait, but one of the options is 2/3, which seems too large compared to 1/6. So, I'm confident that 1/6 is the correct answer.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nIs there a different conversion factor between cups and quarts that I might have missed? No, I'm pretty sure that 1 quart equals 4 cups.\n\nLet me check online or in a measurement conversion table. Okay, a quick search confirms that 1 quart is indeed equal to 4 cups.\n\nSo, my initial conversion is correct.\n\nNow, perhaps someone might think of converting quarts to cups differently, but I don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they could consider liquid quarts versus dry quarts, but in standard kitchen measurements, we usually mean liquid quarts, and the conversion is 4 cups per quart.\n\nUnless specified otherwise, I think it's safe to assume that's the case here.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is indeed 1/6.\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. 1 over 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D}\\ ]"
