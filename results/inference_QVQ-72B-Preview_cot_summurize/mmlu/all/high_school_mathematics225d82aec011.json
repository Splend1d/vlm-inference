                    "text": "So I've got this equation to solve: 3x - 4(x - 2) + 6x - 8 = 0. I need to find the value of x from the given options: A. -4, B. 0, C. 2, D. 4. Alright, let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to simplify the equation. There are terms with x and constant terms, and some are inside parentheses. Let's start by distributing the -4 into the parentheses.\n\nSo, -4(x - 2) is the same as -4 multiplied by x and -4 multiplied by -2. Remember, distributing a negative sign means I'll change the sign of each term inside the parentheses.\n\n-4 * x = -4x\n\n-4 * (-2) = +8\n\nSo, -4(x - 2) becomes -4x + 8.\n\nNow, the equation looks like this:\n\n3x - 4x + 8 + 6x - 8 = 0\n\nNext, I should combine like terms. Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power.\n\nLooking at the x terms: 3x, -4x, and 6x.\n\nAdding those together: 3x - 4x + 6x = (3 - 4 + 6)x = 5x\n\nAnd the constant terms: +8 and -8.\n\nAdding those: 8 + (-8) = 0\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to:\n\n5x + 0 = 0\n\nWhich means 5x = 0\n\nNow, to find x, I need to solve for x.\n\n5x = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\nx = 0\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. -4\n\nB. 0\n\nC. 2\n\nD. 4\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. 0.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStep 1: Distribute -4 into (x - 2):\n\n-4x + 8\n\nThat's correct.\n\nStep 2: Combine like terms:\n\n3x - 4x + 6x = 5x\n\nAnd 8 + (-8) = 0\n\nSo, 5x + 0 = 0\n\nStep 3: Solve for x:\n\n5x = 0\n\nx = 0\n\nSeems straightforward. But just to be thorough, maybe I should plug in the value back into the original equation to verify.\n\nOriginal equation: 3x - 4(x - 2) + 6x - 8 = 0\n\nPlug x = 0:\n\n3*(0) - 4*(0 - 2) + 6*(0) - 8 = 0\n\nWhich is:\n\n0 - 4*(-2) + 0 - 8 = 0\n\n0 + 8 + 0 - 8 = 0\n\n8 - 8 = 0\n\n0 = 0\n\nYes, that checks out. So, x = 0 is indeed the correct solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if there are any other ways to interpret the equation or if there's another approach to solving it.\n\nFor example, maybe I could group terms differently or consider factoring, but given the simplicity of the equation after simplification, I think the approach I took is sufficient and accurate.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is B. 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B}\\]"
