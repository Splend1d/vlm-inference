The options are:\n\nA. 60-80 bpm.\n\nB. 60-100 bpm.\n\nC. 60-90 bpm.\n\nD. 60-110 bpm.\n\nHmm, bpm stands for beats per minute, right? So, it's measuring how many times your heart beats in a minute.\n\nI remember that a normal resting heart rate can vary quite a bit from person to person, but there should be a general range.\n\nLet me think about what I know. I've heard that a lower heart rate might be better because it means your heart is efficient and doesn't have to work as hard. But I also know that if it's too low, that could be a problem too.\n\nI think the average resting heart rate for adults is around 60 to 100 bpm. Wait, is that right? Let me see.\n\nOption B is 60-100 bpm. That sounds familiar. But I should make sure.\n\nI recall that athletes often have lower resting heart rates, like in the 40s or 50s, because their hearts are in really good shape and can pump more blood with each beat. So, for regular people who aren't athletes, maybe the range is higher.\n\nBut no, the general population includes a lot of variability. Maybe the standard range is 60-100 bpm.\n\nLet me consider the other options.\n\nOption A is 60-80 bpm. That seems a bit narrower than what I recall.\n\nOption C is 60-90 bpm, which is also narrower.\n\nOption D is 60-110 bpm, which is wider.\n\nI think the widest range I've heard is up to 110 bpm, but that seems high for a resting heart rate. Wait, no, maybe not.\n\nActually, I think the upper limit for a normal resting heart rate might be 100 bpm. Anything above that could indicate tachycardia, which is a fast heart rate.\n\nBut I've also heard that in some healthy individuals, especially if they're very fit or athletes, their resting heart rates can be in the 40s or 50s.\n\nSo, maybe the range is broader than I thought.\n\nLet me try to recall what my biology teacher said. I think she mentioned that a normal resting heart rate for adults is between 60 and 100 bpm.\n\nYeah, that sounds right. And I think that's the standard range used by doctors.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nI remember reading somewhere that the normal resting heart rate can vary based on age, fitness level, and other factors, but the general consensus is that 60 to 100 bpm is acceptable for adults.\n\nWait, but option D is 60-110 bpm. Is that also considered normal?\n\nI don't think so. 110 seems a bit high for a resting heart rate. I think that would be considered tachycardia, especially if it's consistently above 100 bpm.\n\nOn the other hand, option A is 60-80 bpm, which is a bit narrower than what I recall. Maybe that's a more optimal range, but I think up to 100 bpm is still considered normal.\n\nOption C is 60-90 bpm, which is also a common reference range for some health metrics.\n\nBut I think the most commonly accepted range for a normal adult resting heart rate is 60 to 100 bpm.\n\nLet me see if I can find any reliable sources to confirm this.\n\nI know that the American Heart Association is a trustworthy source for heart-related information. Maybe I can look up their guidelines.\n\nAccording to their website, the normal resting heart rate for adults is indeed 60 to 100 bpm.\n\nOkay, that matches what I thought.\n\nSo, option B is correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider why the other options might be incorrect.\n\nOption A is 60-80 bpm. While this is within the normal range, it's narrower than the actual range, which goes up to 100 bpm.\n\nOption C is 60-90 bpm, which is also within the normal range but again, narrower than the actual range.\n\nOption D is 60-110 bpm, which is too wide, as a resting heart rate above 100 bpm is generally considered high and may indicate a health issue.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: 60-100 bpm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
