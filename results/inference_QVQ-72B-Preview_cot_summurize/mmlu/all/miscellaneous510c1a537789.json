A United States car dealer importing Japanese cars\n\nB. A Japanese tourist vacationing in the United States\n\nC. A worker in the United States beer industry\n\nD. A Japanese baker buying U.S. wheat\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what it means when the U.S. dollar increases relative to the Japanese yen. This means that the dollar is stronger, and the yen is weaker in comparison. So, for the same amount of dollars, you can buy more yen than before.\n\nNow, let's think about how this affects each option.\n\nStarting with option A: a U.S. car dealer importing Japanese cars.\n\nIf the dollar is stronger, it means that the dealer can buy more yen with their dollars. Since Japanese cars are priced in yen, the dealer can get more cars or pay less for the same number of cars. This sounds like it would benefit the dealer because their import costs go down. So, this seems like a possible answer.\n\nNext, option B: a Japanese tourist vacationing in the United States.\n\nIf the dollar is stronger relative to the yen, that means that each yen is worth less in dollars. So, for the tourist, every yen they exchange will buy fewer dollars than before. This means things in the U.S. will be more expensive for them since their yen don't go as far. So, this doesn't seem like it would benefit the tourist.\n\nOption C: a worker in the U.S. beer industry.\n\nHmm, this one is a bit trickier. If the dollar is stronger, it might make U.S. goods more expensive for people in other countries whose currencies are weaker. So, for beer exports to Japan, it might make U.S. beer more expensive in Japan, which could hurt exports. On the other hand, if the stronger dollar makes imports from Japan cheaper, it might benefit U.S. companies in terms of their costs for any imported ingredients or equipment. But, for the worker specifically, it's not entirely clear. Maybe not the most straightforward choice here.\n\nOption D: a Japanese baker buying U.S. wheat.\n\nSimilar to option A, but from the Japanese perspective. If the dollar is stronger, then the yen is weaker, meaning that the baker would need more yen to buy the same amount of wheat priced in dollars. So, this would make wheat more expensive for the baker, which doesn't sound beneficial.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, option A seems to be the most directly benefited by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the yen. The U.S. car dealer can import Japanese cars at a lower cost, which is advantageous.\n\nI think the answer is A. A United States car dealer importing Japanese cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
