                    "text": "So I have this question here about my friend who says, \"Every time I plan a vacation, there's always a crisis at home or work so that I can't go.\" And the question is asking which psychological concept this best illustrates, assuming that it's not really true. The options are psychological reactance, base rate fallacy, illusory correlation, and fundamental attribution bias.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with psychological reactance: I think this is when people feel like their freedom is being threatened, so they do the opposite of what's being suggested or required. Like, if someone tells me I can't do something, I might want to do it even more just to assert my independence. But in this case, my friend is talking about planning vacations and facing crises, which doesn't seem directly related to reactance.\n\nNext is base rate fallacy. I recall that this is a mistake where people ignore the overall probability or base rate of something happening in the general population when making judgments about specific instances. For example, if someone gets a positive test result for a rare disease, they might think they definitely have it, ignoring the base rate of how common the disease is. In my friend's situation, they might be ignoring the base rate of how often crises occur in general, attributing them specifically to when they plan vacations. So, maybe crises happen pretty often regardless of vacation planning, but my friend is seeing a connection where there isn't one.\n\nIllusory correlation is another option. This sounds like when people perceive a relationship between two things that don't actually have a connection. For instance, if someone believes that eating carrots improves vision, even though studies show no significant link. In my friend's case, they might be seeing a link between planning a vacation and having a crisis, when in reality, crises happen independently of vacation plans.\n\nLastly, fundamental attribution bias. I think this is when people tend to attribute others' behavior to their inherent characteristics rather than considering situational factors. For example, if someone cuts you off in traffic, you might think they're rude, rather than considering that they might be in a hurry for an emergency. In this scenario, my friend is attributing the occurrence of crises to their vacation planning rather than other possible factors.\n\nSo, let's summarize:\n\n- Psychological reactance: About resisting constraints on freedom \u2013 doesn't seem to fit.\n\n- Base rate fallacy: Ignoring general probabilities when making judgments \u2013 possibly relevant.\n\n- Illusory correlation: Perceiving a connection where none exists \u2013 also seems relevant.\n\n- Fundamental attribution bias: Overattributing behavior to personal characteristics rather than situational factors \u2013 could be applicable.\n\nGiven that the statement is not true, meaning that crises aren't necessarily tied to vacation planning, my friend might be seeing a pattern where there isn't one. That sounds a lot like illusory correlation.\n\nBut let's think deeper. Could it also be fundamental attribution bias? Maybe my friend is attributing the crises to their own actions (planning vacations) rather than other factors like external circumstances or general stress levels that could lead to crises.\n\nHowever, fundamental attribution bias is typically about attributing others' behavior to their traits rather than situations. In this case, it's my friend's own behavior they're observing, so maybe it's not the best fit.\n\nBase rate fallacy seems relevant too. Maybe crises happen at a certain rate in my friend's life, and planning a vacation doesn't affect that. But my friend is seeing a connection, perhaps ignoring the fact that crises occur regardless of vacation plans.\n\nStill, illusory correlation seems the closest. My friend is perceiving a link between two unrelated events: planning a vacation and having a crisis.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose my friend plans a vacation once a year, and each time, there's a crisis. But in reality, crises also happen at other times when they're not planning a vacation, but my friend doesn't notice those instances. So, they only remember the times when both events coincide, reinforcing the belief in a connection.\n\nThat sounds exactly like illusory correlation \u2013 noticing and remembering the times when two events coincide, even if they're not causally related, and ignoring the times when they don't coincide.\n\nIn contrast, base rate fallacy would involve ignoring the general frequency of crises in favor of seeing a specific connection.\n\nGiven that, I think illusory correlation is the most appropriate answer here.\n\nJust to make sure, let's look back at the definitions:\n\n- Psychological reactance: Resistance to threats against personal freedom \u2013 not relevant.\n\n- Base rate fallacy: Ignoring general probabilities in favor of specific, but possibly misleading, information \u2013 somewhat relevant but not the primary issue here.\n\n- Illusory correlation: Perceiving a relationship between two variables when no such relationship exists \u2013 fits perfectly with my friend's situation.\n\n- Fundamental attribution bias: Overemphasizing personal traits and underemphasizing situational factors in explaining others' behavior \u2013 not directly applicable here.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. illusory correlation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
