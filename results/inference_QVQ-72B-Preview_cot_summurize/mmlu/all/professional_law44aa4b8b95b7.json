                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario here about a delivery person for a drugstore who gets into an accident while on duty. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nSo, this employee is a delivery person for a drugstore. His job is to deliver prescriptions and other items like toiletries, cosmetics, vitamins, and gift products to customers. One afternoon, while he's on duty, he remembers it's his girlfriend's birthday. So, he buys a bottle of perfume from the pharmacy's cosmetics department for $79.95, gets it gift-wrapped, and then drives to his girlfriend's house in the company van to deliver it personally. This happens during his regular working hours, and he was on his way to make another delivery from his van.\n\nBut, he's in a hurry and drives through a red light, colliding with another vehicle driven by someone else. The other driver is injured, and both vehicles are extensively damaged. Now, if the injured driver sues the drugstore to recover damages from the accident, the question is, who will probably prevail?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Prevail, because the employee paid for the perfume.\n\nB. Prevail, because the employee was under the control and direction of the drugstore at the time of the accident.\n\nC. Not prevail, because the employee was acting outside the scope of the employment relationship at the time of the accident.\n\nD. Not prevail, because the drugstore was not negligent in hiring the employee.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand the relationship here. The employee is working for the drugstore, delivering items to customers. But in this case, he's delivering a personal item to his girlfriend, not a company's customer's item.\n\nBut, he's using the company van and doing this during his working hours while en route to make another delivery.\n\nSo, was he acting within the scope of his employment when the accident happened?\n\nI think that's the key question here.\n\nGenerally, in law, employers are liable for the actions of their employees if those actions are within the scope of their employment. This is called vicarious liability.\n\nSo, if the employee was acting within the scope of his employment when the accident occurred, then the drugstore would be liable for the damages.\n\nBut, if he was acting outside the scope of his employment, then the drugstore wouldn't be liable.\n\nIn this case, he was supposed to be making deliveries for the drugstore, but he diverted to deliver a personal gift to his girlfriend.\n\nSo, was this personal errand within the scope of his employment?\n\nI think not, because it was a personal action, not related to his job duties.\n\nBut, he was using the company van and was en route to make another delivery.\n\nSo, maybe there's some connection to his employment.\n\nI need to think about whether this detour was so outside the scope of his employment that the drugstore shouldn't be held liable.\n\nI recall that in some cases, if an employee is on a \"frolic of his own,\" meaning acting entirely outside the scope of employment, the employer may not be liable.\n\nBut, in other cases, if the employee is still performing some work-related tasks, even if there's a personal errand involved, the employer might still be liable.\n\nIn this scenario, the employee was on his way to make another delivery from his van, so he was still performing work duties.\n\nHe just took a detour to deliver a personal gift.\n\nSo, maybe the drugstore would still be liable because he was using the company van and was still on duty.\n\nBut, on the other hand, the act of delivering the perfume was purely personal.\n\nHe paid for it himself, had it gift-wrapped, and was delivering it to his girlfriend.\n\nSo, it seems like a personal errand.\n\nBut, using the company van might complicate things.\n\nI need to consider if the use of the company van makes it more likely that the drugstore is liable.\n\nMaybe, because the van is company property, and he was authorized to use it for deliveries.\n\nBut, was he authorized to use it for personal deliveries?\n\nProbably not, unless the company allows personal use of vehicles during work hours.\n\nI don't have information about that.\n\nAssuming standard rules, probably not.\n\nSo, perhaps the drugstore wouldn't be liable because he was acting outside the scope of his employment.\n\nBut, what about the fact that he was en route to make another delivery?\n\nDoes that change things?\n\nMaybe, because he was still on duty and performing work-related tasks.\n\nBut, the act of delivering the perfume was a separate, personal act.\n\nSo, it's a bit of a gray area.\n\nI need to think about the principle of \"detour\" in agency law.\n\nI think there's a concept that if an employee takes a slight detour for personal reasons but is still generally engaged in work activities, the employer may still be liable.\n\nBut, if it's a substantial deviation, it might be considered outside the scope of employment.\n\nIn this case, delivering a personal gift to his girlfriend seems like a substantial deviation from his work duties.\n\nSo, perhaps the drugstore wouldn't be liable.\n\nBut, I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nSuppose the employee was solely on a personal mission, completely separate from his work.\n\nThen, the drugstore wouldn't be liable.\n\nBut, here, he was on his way to make another delivery, so it's not entirely separate.\n\nHe was still performing work duties, just with a personal errand in between.\n\nSo, maybe the drugstore is still liable.\n\nBut, I think in most jurisdictions, if the employee is engaged in a personal errand that is separate from their work duties, the employer isn't liable for accidents that occur during that errand.\n\nEspecially since he was using the company van, which might impose some level of control or connection to the employer.\n\nBut, again, if it's a personal errand, the employer might not be responsible.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nMaybe I should look up some case law or general principles about this.\n\nI recall a case where an employee was running a personal errand during work hours and got into an accident.\n\nThe court had to decide whether it was within the scope of employment.\n\nI think the key factors are:\n\n- How closely related the errand was to the employee's duties.\n\n- Whether the employee was still performing work-related tasks.\n\n- The extent to which the errand was personal versus work-related.\n\nIn this scenario, the errand was purely personal (delivering a gift to his girlfriend), but he was still on duty and performing work-related tasks.\n\nSo, it's a mix.\n\nI think the drugstore might not be liable because the act of delivering the perfume was entirely personal.\n\nEven though he was using the company van and was en route to another delivery, the act of delivering the perfume wasn't part of his work duties.\n\nTherefore, the accident occurred while he was engaged in a personal activity, not in furtherance of the employer's business.\n\nSo, the driver probably wouldn't prevail in a suit against the drugstore.\n\nOption C seems to align with this reasoning.\n\nBut, let's look at the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A says the driver will prevail because the employee paid for the perfume.\n\nHmm, I don't see the connection there.\n\nThe fact that the employee paid for the perfume doesn't directly relate to whether the drugstore is liable for the accident.\n\nPaying for the perfume indicates it's a personal purchase, which supports the idea that the delivery was personal, not work-related.\n\nSo, this option doesn't make much sense.\n\nOption B says the driver will prevail because the employee was under the control and direction of the drugstore at the time of the accident.\n\nWell, being under the control and direction of the employer is generally a factor in determining whether an employee is acting within the scope of employment.\n\nBut, in this case, even if the employee was under the employer's control, if he was engaged in a personal errand, it might not be enough to hold the employer liable.\n\nSo, I don't think this is the correct answer.\n\nOption D says the driver will not prevail because the drugstore was not negligent in hiring the employee.\n\nNegligent hiring is a different theory of liability, where the employer is liable if they knew or should have known that the employee posed a risk.\n\nBut, in this scenario, the accident was caused by the employee running a red light while in a hurry to deliver a personal gift, not by any inherent dangerous propensity or prior bad acts that the employer should have known about.\n\nSo, unless there's information suggesting that the employee had a history of reckless driving that the drugstore knew about, this doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nTherefore, option D is probably not correct.\n\nSo, between options C and D, option C seems more appropriate.\n\nThe employee was acting outside the scope of his employment when the accident occurred, so the drugstore shouldn't be liable.\n\nTherefore, the driver would not prevail.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C}
