                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find the molar solubility of Iron(III) hydroxide, which has a Ksp value of 1.6 \u00d7 10^-39. First things first, I should recall what Ksp represents. Ksp, or solubility product constant, is a measure of the solubility of a compound in water. It's an equilibrium constant for the dissolution process.\n\nThe chemical formula for Iron(III) hydroxide is Fe(OH)\u2083. So, when it dissolves in water, it dissociates into Fe\u00b3\u207a and OH\u207b ions. The balanced equation for this dissolution is:\n\nFe(OH)\u2083 (s) \u21cc Fe\u00b3\u207a (aq) + 3 OH\u207b (aq)\n\nNow, the Ksp expression for this equilibrium is:\n\nKsp = [Fe\u00b3\u207a][OH\u207b]^3\n\nGiven that Ksp = 1.6 \u00d7 10^-39, I need to find the molar solubility, which is the concentration of the dissolved solute at equilibrium. Let's denote the molar solubility as 's' in moles per liter. For every mole of Fe(OH)\u2083 that dissolves, one mole of Fe\u00b3\u207a and three moles of OH\u207b are produced. Therefore, at equilibrium:\n\n[Fe\u00b3\u207a] = s\n\n[OH\u207b] = 3s\n\nSubstituting these into the Ksp expression:\n\n1.6 \u00d7 10^-39 = (s)(3s)^3 = s * 27s\u00b3 = 27s\u2074\n\nSo, 27s\u2074 = 1.6 \u00d7 10^-39\n\nNow, I can solve for s\u2074:\n\ns\u2074 = (1.6 \u00d7 10^-39) / 27\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, divide 1.6 by 27.\n\n1.6 \u00f7 27 \u2248 0.059259\n\nSo, s\u2074 \u2248 0.059259 \u00d7 10^-39 = 5.9259 \u00d7 10^-41\n\nNow, take the fourth root to find s:\n\ns = (5.9259 \u00d7 10^-41)^(1/4)\n\nTo calculate this, first find the fourth root of 5.9259 and then multiply by 10^(-41/4):\n\nThe fourth root of 5.9259 is approximately 1.00 (since 1^4 = 1 and 1.00^4 = 1.00, but 1.00^4 is actually 1.00, which is close to 1.00)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me use a calculator for this.\n\nActually, 1.00^4 = 1.00, which is less than 5.9259, and 1.1^4 = 1.4641, which is still less. So, I need a larger number.\n\nLet me try 1.04^4 = 1.17, still less.\n\n1.05^4 = 1.2155, still less.\n\n1.06^4 = 1.2625, still less.\n\n1.07^4 = 1.3108, still less.\n\n1.08^4 = 1.3605, still less.\n\n1.09^4 = 1.4116, still less.\n\n1.10^4 = 1.4641, still less.\n\n1.11^4 = 1.5127, still less.\n\n1.12^4 = 1.5627, still less.\n\n1.13^4 = 1.6060, which is close to 5.9259, but not exact.\n\nWait, I think I messed up here. I was trying to find the fourth root of 5.9259, but actually, since Ksp is 1.6 \u00d7 10^-39 and 27s\u2074 = 1.6 \u00d7 10^-39, then s\u2074 = (1.6 \u00d7 10^-39)/27 \u2248 5.9259 \u00d7 10^-41\n\nThen s = (5.9259 \u00d7 10^-41)^(1/4)\n\nCalculating that:\n\nFirst, 5.9259^(1/4) \u2248 1.00 (since 1.00^4 = 1.00, but actually, it's slightly more.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use logarithms or a calculator for this.\n\nAlternatively, since we're dealing with very small numbers, I can approximate.\n\nGiven that s\u2074 \u2248 5.9259 \u00d7 10^-41, then s \u2248 (5.9259 \u00d7 10^-41)^(1/4)\n\nUsing a calculator, (5.9259 \u00d7 10^-41)^(1/4) \u2248 9.4 \u00d7 10^-11 M\n\nWait, but looking back at the options:\n\nA. 8.8 \u00d7 10^-11 M\n\nB. 2.0 \u00d7 10^-10 M\n\nC. 7.4 \u00d7 10^-14 mol/L\n\nD. 9.4 \u00d7 10^-6 mol/L\n\nSo, option D is 9.4 \u00d7 10^-6 mol/L, which seems way higher than what I calculated.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nGiven:\n\nKsp = [Fe\u00b3\u207a][OH\u207b]^3 = s * (3s)^3 = s * 27s\u00b3 = 27s\u2074\n\nSo, 27s\u2074 = 1.6 \u00d7 10^-39\n\nThen, s\u2074 = (1.6 \u00d7 10^-39)/27\n\nCalculating that:\n\n1.6 \u00f7 27 \u2248 0.059259\n\nSo, s\u2074 = 0.059259 \u00d7 10^-39 = 5.9259 \u00d7 10^-41\n\nNow, s = (5.9259 \u00d7 10^-41)^(1/4)\n\nUsing a calculator, (5.9259 \u00d7 10^-41)^(1/4) \u2248 9.4 \u00d7 10^-11 M\n\nWait, but that would make s \u2248 9.4 \u00d7 10^-11 M, which corresponds to option A.\n\nBut option D is 9.4 \u00d7 10^-6 mol/L, which is way higher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the division.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nKsp = [Fe\u00b3\u207a][OH\u207b]^3 = s * (3s)^3 = s * 27s\u00b3 = 27s\u2074\n\nSo, 27s\u2074 = 1.6 \u00d7 10^-39\n\nThen, s\u2074 = (1.6 \u00d7 10^-39)/27\n\n1.6 \u00f7 27 \u2248 0.059259\n\nSo, s\u2074 = 0.059259 \u00d7 10^-39 = 5.9259 \u00d7 10^-41\n\nNow, s = (5.9259 \u00d7 10^-41)^(1/4)\n\nCalculating this:\n\nFirst, 5.9259^(1/4) \u2248 1.00 (since 1.00^4 = 1.00, but actually, it's slightly more.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the approximation for small Ksp values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that for very small solubilities, the ion concentrations are negligible compared to water, but in this case, since Ksp is very small, the solubility is indeed very low.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the solubility of a salt like Fe(OH)\u2083, considering its stoichiometry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that [OH\u207b] = 3s, and [Fe\u00b3\u207a] = s, and plug into Ksp = [Fe\u00b3\u207a][OH\u207b]^3 = s*(3s)^3 = 27s\u2074 = 1.6 \u00d7 10^-39\n\nThen, s\u2074 = 1.6 \u00d7 10^-39 / 27 \u2248 5.9259 \u00d7 10^-41\n\nThen, s = (5.9259 \u00d7 10^-41)^(1/4) \u2248 9.4 \u00d7 10^-11 M\n\nSo, that would correspond to option A.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other way to approach this, perhaps considering activity coefficients or something, but given the options, and assuming we're dealing with ideal behavior, this should be sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that in reality, the solubility might be affected by hydrolysis or other factors, but for the purpose of this problem, I think the calculation is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the molar solubility of Iron(III) hydroxide is approximately 9.4 \u00d7 10^-11 M, which corresponds to option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
