                    "text": "So I have this question about the total spin quantum number for neutral nitrogen in its ground state. The options are 1/2, 1, 3/2, and 5/2. I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me start by recalling some basic atomic structure and quantum mechanics.\n\nFirst, neutral nitrogen has an atomic number Z = 7, which means it has 7 electrons. Its electron configuration in the ground state should be 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u00b3. So, the outermost shell is n=2, and it has three electrons in the 2p orbital.\n\nNow, spin quantum number relates to the intrinsic angular momentum of electrons. Each electron has a spin quantum number, s, which can be either +1/2 or -1/2. The total spin quantum number, S, for the atom is determined by how these individual spins couple together.\n\nThere are two main ways that electron spins can couple: parallel or antiparallel. If they are parallel, their spins add up, and if they are antiparallel, they cancel each other out, at least partially.\n\nIn the case of nitrogen, with its three 2p electrons, I need to consider how these spins interact. I recall that for multiple electrons in the same subshell, the total spin can range from the maximum possible down to zero, depending on how the spins are aligned.\n\nThe maximum total spin is achieved when all spins are parallel. For three electrons, that would be S = 3/2. The possible total spin values would then be S = 3/2, 1/2, and 0.\n\nBut nitrogen is unique because its electron configuration is 2p\u00b3, which is exactly half-filled. I think half-filled shells tend to have all spins aligned, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up the Aufbau principle or Hund's rules to guide me here.\n\nHund's first rule states that electrons in the same subshell fill with parallel spins as much as possible, and this configuration is the lowest in energy. So, for the 2p orbitals, which have three degenerate orbitals (px, py, pz), the three electrons will occupy different orbitals with parallel spins.\n\nTherefore, the total spin S should be the sum of the individual spins. Since each electron has s = 1/2, and they are all aligned parallel, S = 3 * (1/2) = 3/2.\n\nWait a minute, but I see option D is 5/2, which would be S = 3/2 + 1/2 + 1/2, but that doesn't make sense because if they are all parallel, it should be just 3/2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps using the concept of term symbols in atomic spectroscopy.\n\nFor nitrogen, with three electrons in 2p orbitals, the term symbol would be ^4S, where the superscript 4 indicates that the total spin angular momentum is S = 3/2 (since 2S + 1 = 4 \u21d2 S = 3/2).\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the total spin quantum number should be 3/2.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nI recall that for atoms with more than one electron, the total spin can be affected by spin-orbit coupling, which can split the energy levels. However, in the ground state of nitrogen, the spin-orbit coupling is typically negligible, so the total spin should still be 3/2.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the number of unpaired electrons. In the 2p\u00b3 configuration with parallel spins, there are three unpaired electrons, each contributing 1/2 to the total spin, again leading to S = 3/2.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider the possible multiplicity for three electrons. The multiplicity is given by 2S + 1. So, for S = 3/2, multiplicity is 4, which matches the ^4S term symbol.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 3/2.\n\nBut just to be extra sure, let's consider if there's any possibility of a different total spin.\n\nSuppose that one of the electrons has its spin aligned opposite to the other two. In that case, the total spin would be S = 1/2 (since 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2 = 1/2). But this would violate Hund's first rule, which says that the state with the maximum total spin is the lowest in energy.\n\nTherefore, the ground state should have the highest total spin, which is S = 3/2.\n\nAdditionally, experimental evidence supports this, as nitrogen atoms in their ground state have a total spin of 3/2.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. 3/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{2}} \\]"
