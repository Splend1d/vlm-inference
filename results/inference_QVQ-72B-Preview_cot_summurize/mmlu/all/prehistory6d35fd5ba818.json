                    "text": "So I've got this question here about anatomy, specifically about a feature of the skull. It's asking what a continuous, projecting ridge of bone above and across the eye orbits is called. The options are:\n\nA. sagittal crest.\n\nB. supraorbital torus.\n\nC. maxilla.\n\nD. occipital bone.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what's being described. There's a ridge of bone that runs continuously above and across the eye orbits. So, it's like a bump or a raised area that spans across the front of the skull, just above where the eyes are.\n\nLet me recall what each of these terms refers to.\n\nStarting with the sagittal crest. I think the sagittal crest is a feature on the skull, but I'm a bit fuzzy on its exact location. Let me remember: the sagittal crest is a raised ridge that runs along the top of the skull, following the line where the two parietal bones meet. So, that's the midline of the skull, running from front to back. Hmm, that doesn't sound like it's above and across the eye orbits. The eye orbits are more towards the front of the skull, and the sagittal crest is more towards the top. So, maybe not A.\n\nNext, the supraorbital torus. The word \"supraorbital\" suggests that it's above the orbits, which fits the description of being above the eye sockets. \"Torus\" means a rounded ridge. So, this sounds like it could be a continuous, projecting ridge of bone above the eye orbits. This seems promising.\n\nNow, the maxilla. I know that the maxilla is the upper jawbone, which holds the upper teeth. It's located below the eye orbits, not above them. So, this doesn't match the description of being above the eye orbits. So, probably not C.\n\nLastly, the occipital bone. This is the bone at the back of the skull, covering the base of the skull and the back of the head. It doesn't relate to the area above the eye orbits, which is more towards the front of the skull. So, D seems unlikely.\n\nLet me double-check. The question is about a ridge above and across the eye orbits. The supraorbital torus is specifically named for being above the orbits, and \"torus\" means a rounded ridge, which matches the description of a projecting ridge.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should make sure that the sagittal crest isn't somehow related to this area. But no, the sagittal crest is on the top of the skull, while the eye orbits are towards the front. So, it's unlikely that the sagittal crest would be considered as being above and across the eye orbits.\n\nMaybe I should consider if there's any connection between these structures. For example, does the supraorbital torus connect to the sagittal crest or anything like that? I don't think so. They seem to be separate features.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the supraorbital torus is sometimes referred to as the supraorbital ridge. So, it's a common anatomical feature that can vary in prominence among different individuals and species.\n\nGiven all this, I think the correct answer is B. supraorbital torus.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's see if there's any possibility that another option could be correct. The maxilla is definitely not above the orbits; it's below them. The occipital bone is at the back of the skull, not the front. And the sagittal crest is on the top of the skull, not above the orbits in the frontal view.\n\nSo, I'm confident that B. supraorbital torus is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
