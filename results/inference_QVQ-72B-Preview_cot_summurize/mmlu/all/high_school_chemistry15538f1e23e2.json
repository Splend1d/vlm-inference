                    "text": "So I have this problem about Joseph Priestley discovering oxygen gas by decomposing mercury(II) oxide. It says that when solid mercury(II) oxide decomposes, it turns into oxygen gas and liquid mercury metal. The question is asking how many moles of oxygen gas will form when 4.32 grams of solid mercury(II) oxide decomposes, and it gives me that the formula mass of mercury(II) oxide is 216 grams per mole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the chemical equation for this decomposition. The reaction is:\n\n2 HgO \u2192 2 Hg + O\u2082\n\nSo, two moles of mercury(II) oxide decompose to give two moles of mercury and one mole of oxygen gas.\n\nNow, I have 4.32 grams of HgO, and I need to find out how many moles of O\u2082 are produced.\n\nStep 1: Convert grams of HgO to moles of HgO.\n\nI know that the molar mass of HgO is 216 g/mol.\n\nSo, moles of HgO = mass / molar mass = 4.32 g / 216 g/mol = 0.02 mol HgO.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 4.32 divided by 216 is indeed 0.02. So, 0.02 moles of HgO.\n\nStep 2: Use the stoichiometry of the reaction to find moles of O\u2082.\n\nFrom the balanced equation, 2 moles of HgO produce 1 mole of O\u2082.\n\nSo, moles of O\u2082 = moles of HgO \u00d7 (1 mol O\u2082 / 2 mol HgO) = 0.02 mol HgO \u00d7 0.5 = 0.01 mol O\u2082.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, 0.01 moles of oxygen gas should be produced from 0.02 moles of HgO.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option B is 0.0100 mol, which seems to match.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any other way to approach this, maybe to ensure I'm not missing something.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nStep 1: Confirm the balanced equation.\n\n2 HgO \u2192 2 Hg + O\u2082\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nStep 2: Calculate moles of HgO as I did before: 4.32 g / 216 g/mol = 0.02 mol HgO.\n\nStep 3: Use the stoichiometric ratio: since 2 moles of HgO produce 1 mole of O\u2082, then 0.02 moles of HgO will produce (0.02 / 2) = 0.01 moles of O\u2082.\n\nSame result as before.\n\nMaybe I should also consider significant figures. The mass given is 4.32 grams, which has three significant figures, and the molar mass is given as 216 g/mol, which also has three significant figures. So, my answer should have three significant figures.\n\nLooking at option B, it's 0.0100 mol, which has three significant figures. Option A is 0.100 mol, which has three significant figures, but that doesn't match our calculation. Option C is 0.0200 mol, which would be double our calculated value, and option D is 0.0150 mol, which is higher than our calculation.\n\nSo, based on my calculations, 0.0100 mol seems to be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nThe balanced equation is:\n\n2 HgO \u2192 2 Hg + O\u2082\n\nSo, for every two moles of HgO, one mole of O\u2082 is produced.\n\nTherefore, moles of O\u2082 = (1/2) \u00d7 moles of HgO = (1/2) \u00d7 0.02 mol = 0.01 mol.\n\nYes, that confirms it again.\n\nI think the answer is 0.0100 mol, which corresponds to option B.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider the molar mass more precisely.\n\nThe molar mass of HgO is given as 216 g/mol. If I wanted to be more precise, the molar mass of mercury is approximately 200.59 g/mol, and oxygen is 16.00 g/mol, so HgO should be approximately 216.59 g/mol. But since the problem provides 216 g/mol, I should use that value.\n\nSo, moles of HgO = 4.32 g / 216 g/mol = 0.0200 mol.\n\nThen, moles of O\u2082 = 0.0200 mol \u00d7 (1/2) = 0.0100 mol.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 0.0100 mol, option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
