                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an object resting on an inclined plane with an angle of incline \\(\\theta\\), acceleration due to gravity \\(g\\), and a coefficient of friction \\(\\mu\\) between the object and the plane. We need to find the acceleration of the object, and there are several options given. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I should probably draw a free-body diagram to understand the forces acting on the object. There's the weight of the object, which is \\(mg\\), where \\(m\\) is the mass of the object. This weight can be broken down into components that are parallel and perpendicular to the inclined plane.\n\nThe component of the weight parallel to the plane is \\(mg \\sin \\theta\\), and it's acting down the plane, trying to make the object slide downward. The component perpendicular to the plane is \\(mg \\cos \\theta\\), which is pressing the object against the plane.\n\nNow, since there's friction between the object and the plane, there will be a frictional force \\(f\\) acting up the plane, opposing the motion. The maximum static friction force is \\(\\mu_s n\\), where \\(n\\) is the normal force. In this case, the normal force \\(n\\) is equal to the perpendicular component of the weight, which is \\(mg \\cos \\theta\\). So, the maximum static friction force is \\(\\mu_s mg \\cos \\theta\\).\n\nBut since the object is already moving, we should use the kinetic friction coefficient, which is usually denoted by \\(\\mu_k\\). However, the problem states \\(\\mu\\) as the coefficient of friction, so I'll assume it's \\(\\mu_k\\) for kinetic friction.\n\nTherefore, the frictional force \\(f\\) is \\(\\mu_k mg \\cos \\theta\\).\n\nNow, the net force acting down the plane is the parallel component of the weight minus the frictional force:\n\n\\[f_{\\text{net}} = mg \\sin \\theta - \\mu_k mg \\cos \\theta\\]\n\nThis net force causes the acceleration of the object. According to Newton's second law, \\(f_{\\text{net}} = ma\\), where \\(m\\) is the mass of the object and \\(a\\) is the acceleration.\n\nSo, we can solve for \\(a\\):\n\n\\[a = \\frac{f_{\\text{net}}}{m} = \\frac{mg \\sin \\theta - \\mu_k mg \\cos \\theta}{m} = g (\\sin \\theta - \\mu_k \\cos \\theta)\\]\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. \\(a = g \\sin \\theta\\)\n\nB. \\(a = g (\\sin \\theta - \\cos \\theta)\\)\n\nC. \\(a = g (\\cos \\theta - \\mu \\sin \\theta)\\)\n\nD. \\(a = g (\\sin \\theta - \\mu \\cos \\theta)\\)\n\nOur derived expression matches option D: \\(a = g (\\sin \\theta - \\mu \\cos \\theta)\\).\n\nWait a minute, but in the problem, it's given as \\(\\mu\\), not \\(\\mu_k\\). However, since the object is moving, it should be the kinetic friction coefficient. Assuming that \\(\\mu\\) refers to \\(\\mu_k\\), then yes, option D is correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the object were not moving yet, and we were trying to find the acceleration starting from rest. In that case, we'd need to consider static friction, but since the object is already moving, kinetic friction applies.\n\nAlso, I should consider if the frictional force is sufficient to prevent motion. But since the object is already moving, as stated in the problem, we can assume that the frictional force is less than the component of the weight down the plane, hence there is net acceleration.\n\nAnother thing to consider is if the frictional force is enough to balance the downslope component, but again, since the object is moving, it implies that the downslope component is greater than the frictional force.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the forces in terms of components again to double-check.\n\nLet's resolve the forces parallel to the plane:\n\n- Down the plane: \\(mg \\sin \\theta\\)\n\n- Up the plane: \\(f = \\mu mg \\cos \\theta\\) (assuming \\(\\mu\\) is \\(\\mu_k\\))\n\nNet force down the plane: \\(mg \\sin \\theta - \\mu mg \\cos \\theta\\)\n\nThus, acceleration \\(a = g (\\sin \\theta - \\mu \\cos \\theta)\\), which matches option D.\n\nWait, but what if \\(\\mu\\) is \\(\\mu_s\\), the static friction coefficient? If that's the case, then the friction force would be \\(\\mu_s mg \\cos \\theta\\), but since the object is already moving, it should be \\(\\mu_k\\), not \\(\\mu_s\\). Typically, \\(\\mu\\) without specification is often assumed to be the kinetic friction coefficient.\n\nTherefore, option D seems correct.\n\nHowever, to ensure there are no mistakes, let's consider the units of each term.\n\n- \\(g\\) has units of m/s\u00b2\n\n- \\(\\sin \\theta\\) and \\(\\cos \\theta\\) are dimensionless\n\n- \\(\\mu\\) is also dimensionless (it's a ratio of forces)\n\nThus, \\(g (\\sin \\theta - \\mu \\cos \\theta)\\) has units of m/s\u00b2, which is consistent with acceleration.\n\nOption A: \\(g \\sin \\theta\\) has units of m/s\u00b2, but doesn't account for friction.\n\nOption B: \\(g (\\sin \\theta - \\cos \\theta)\\) doesn't make physical sense because \\(\\sin \\theta\\) and \\(\\cos \\theta\\) are related to different components of the weight, and subtracting them wouldn't give the correct net acceleration.\n\nOption C: \\(g (\\cos \\theta - \\mu \\sin \\theta)\\) seems incorrect because the friction force should be opposing the motion down the plane, which is the \\(\\sin \\theta\\) component, not the \\(\\cos \\theta\\) component.\n\nTherefore, option D appears to be the correct choice.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's think about extreme cases.\n\n1. If \\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\), the plane is horizontal. The acceleration should be zero because the only horizontal force is friction, but in this case, with no downslope component, the object shouldn't accelerate. Plugging \\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\) into option D:\n\n\\(a = g (\\sin 0^\\circ - \\mu \\cos 0^\\circ) = g (0 - \\mu \\times 1) = -\\mu g\\)\n\nWait, that suggests a negative acceleration, meaning deceleration, which might make sense if the object was moving horizontally, but in this scenario, if the plane is horizontal and there's friction, the object should decelerate. However, the problem states that the object is resting on the plane, so perhaps it's starting from rest.\n\nBut in the problem, it says \"the object rests on a plane,\" which might imply it's at rest, but the question is about its acceleration, perhaps considering it starts to move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the object is already sliding, and we're to find its acceleration due to the component of gravity and friction.\n\nGiven that, perhaps for \\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\), \\(a = g (\\sin 0^\\circ - \\mu \\cos 0^\\circ) = -\\mu g\\), which would indicate deceleration, making sense if the object was moving horizontally and friction was slowing it down.\n\nBut in the context of an inclined plane, if \\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\), the object shouldn't be accelerating at all, so maybe this is a point to consider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes the object is already sliding down the plane, so even at \\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\), it's moving, and friction is slowing it down.\n\nIn any case, option D seems to align with the standard calculation for acceleration down an inclined plane with friction.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
