                    "text": "Alright, so I've come across this question about \"motor voter\" laws. I have to admit, I'm not entirely sure what a \"motor voter\" law is, but it sounds like it has something to do with driving and voting. Let's see, the options are:\n\nA. To increase turnout on election days\n\nB. To make it easier for citizens to register to vote\n\nC. To require that all voters know how to drive\n\nD. To establish voter identification laws\n\nHmm, option C seems a bit odd. I can't imagine that knowing how to drive would be a requirement for voting. That just doesn't make sense. So, I'll probably eliminate that one right off the bat.\n\nNow, between A, B, and D, I need to figure out which one is the primary purpose of \"motor voter\" laws. Let me think about what \"motor voter\" might refer to. \"Motor\" makes me think of cars or driving, and \"voter\" obviously relates to voting. So, perhaps it's about connecting vehicle registration or driver's licenses with voter registration.\n\nI recall that in some places, when you get a driver's license or register your vehicle, there's an option to register to vote at the same time. Maybe that's what \"motor voter\" laws are about\u2014making it convenient for people to register to vote when they interact with motor vehicle departments.\n\nIf that's the case, then it would be about making voter registration easier, which aligns with option B: To make it easier for citizens to register to vote.\n\nBut wait, option A says \"to increase turnout on election days.\" If \"motor voter\" laws make it easier to register, then wouldn't that potentially lead to higher turnout because more people are registered? So, maybe A is a consequence of B. But is increasing turnout the primary purpose, or is it just a beneficial outcome?\n\nLet me consider option D: To establish voter identification laws. I know that some voter ID laws can be controversial, as they might make it harder for certain people to vote. But \"motor voter\" laws seem to be about making registration easier, not necessarily about identifying voters at the polls. So, maybe D isn't directly related.\n\nGiven that, I think the primary purpose of \"motor voter\" laws is B: To make it easier for citizens to register to vote. The idea is probably to streamline the registration process by combining it with interactions related to motor vehicles, like getting a driver's license or updating your address.\n\nTo double-check, I might recall that the National Motor Voter Act, also known as the \"motor voter\" law, was passed in the United States in 1993. It requires states to offer voter registration opportunities at driver's license agencies and other public offices. So, yes, it's primarily about facilitating voter registration.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. To make it easier for citizens to register to vote.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
