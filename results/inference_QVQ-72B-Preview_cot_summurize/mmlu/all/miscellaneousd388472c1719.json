Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my drama terms, but I think I can work this out.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a \"Shavian\" play is. The term sounds familiar, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait a minute, I think it refers to the works of a specific playwright. Let me see... The prefix \"Shaw\" makes me think of George Bernard Shaw. He was a famous playwright, wasn't he? Yeah, that seems plausible.\n\nLet me double-check. George Bernard Shaw was an Irish playwright who lived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He wrote plays like \"Pygmalion\" and \"Man and Superman.\" I recall that his plays often had social critiques and were known for their wit and intelligence. But is \"Shavian\" specifically referring to his work?\n\nI should consider the context. The question is asking, \"If you are watching a Shavian play, who is the author?\" The options are Shakespeare, Aeschylus, George Bernard Shaw, and Anton Chekhov. So, among these, who does the term \"Shavian\" refer to?\n\nLet me think about the characteristics of a Shavian play. I remember that Shaw was known for his use of dialogue, his exploration of serious social issues with a touch of humor, and his tendency to provoke thought and discussion. His plays often had strong, well-developed characters and complex plots.\n\nNow, comparing that to the other authors:\n\n- Shakespeare: While Shakespeare is renowned for his masterful use of language and deep character development, his plays are from a different era and have a different style compared to Shaw's work.\n\n- Aeschylus: He was an ancient Greek tragedian, known for plays like \"Oresteia.\" His works are quite different in style and substance from Shaw's plays.\n\n- Anton Chekhov: A Russian playwright known for his realistic plays that explore the complexities of human relationships, such as \"The Cherry Orchard\" and \"Uncle Vanya.\" While there are some similarities in terms of character depth, the style differs from Shaw's.\n\nGiven this, it seems most logical that \"Shavian\" refers to George Bernard Shaw. But just to be thorough, I should consider if \"Shavian\" could possibly refer to Shakespeare.\n\nWait a second, sometimes terms like \"Shakespearean\" are used to describe plays in the style of Shakespeare. Maybe \"Shavian\" is similar, referring to Shaw's style. But the question specifies \"a Shavian play,\" which implies a specific play by Shaw, not necessarily a play in his style.\n\nMoreover, the term \"Shavian\" is commonly associated with George Bernard Shaw, particularly in the context of his plays and his distinctive writing style. So, it's highly likely that \"Shavian play\" refers to a play written by George Bernard Shaw.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll consider an example. If someone says they are watching a Shakespearean play, they might be watching \"Hamlet\" or \"Macbeth.\" Similarly, a Shavian play would likely be one of Shaw's plays, such as \"Pygmalion\" or \"Saint Joan.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. George Bernard Shaw.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
