The propositions are:\n\n1. \\((G \\lor \\sim H) \\supset G\\)\n\n2. \\(\\sim G \\equiv (\\sim H \\cdot G)\\)\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these symbols mean:\n\n- \\(G\\) and \\(H\\) are propositional variables.\n\n- \\(\\lor\\) means \"or\" (inclusive).\n\n- \\(\\sim\\) means \"not.\"\n\n- \\(\\supset\\) means \"implies.\"\n\n- \\(\\equiv\\) means \"if and only if\" or \"equivalent.\"\n\n- \\(\\cdot\\) means \"and.\"\n\nMy task is to build truth tables for both propositions and then see how they relate to each other. Specifically, I need to check if they are logically equivalent, contradictory, consistent, or inconsistent.\n\nLet's start by listing all possible truth values for \\(G\\) and \\(H\\). Since both are propositions, each can be either true (T) or false (F). So, there are four possible combinations:\n\n1. \\(G = T\\), \\(H = T\\)\n\n2. \\(G = T\\), \\(H = F\\)\n\n3. \\(G = F\\), \\(H = T\\)\n\n4. \\(G = F\\), \\(H = F\\)\n\nNow, I'll construct the truth table for the first proposition: \\((G \\lor \\sim H) \\supset G\\)\n\nFirst, compute \\(\\sim H\\) for each combination:\n\n- If \\(H = T\\), then \\(\\sim H = F\\)\n\n- If \\(H = F\\), then \\(\\sim H = T\\)\n\nNext, compute \\(G \\lor \\sim H\\):\n\n- When \\(G = T\\), \\(\\sim H = F\\), so \\(T \\lor F = T\\)\n\n- When \\(G = T\\), \\(\\sim H = T\\), so \\(T \\lor T = T\\)\n\n- When \\(G = F\\), \\(\\sim H = F\\), so \\(F \\lor F = F\\)\n\n- When \\(G = F\\), \\(\\sim H = T\\), so \\(F \\lor T = T\\)\n\nThen, compute \\((G \\lor \\sim H) \\supset G\\):\n\n- Recall that \\(A \\supset B\\) is equivalent to \\(\\sim A \\lor B\\)\n\n- So, for each case:\n\n- \\(T \\supset T = T\\)\n\n- \\(T \\supset T = T\\)\n\n- \\(F \\supset F = T\\)\n\n- \\(T \\supset F = F\\)\n\nSo, the truth table for \\((G \\lor \\sim H) \\supset G\\) is:\n\n| G | H | \\sim H | G \\lor \\sim H | (G \\lor \\sim H) \\supset G |\n|---|---|-------|--------------|------------------------|\n| T | T |   F   |      T       |          T             |\n| T | F |   T   |      T       |          T             |\n| F | T |   F   |      F       |          T             |\n| F | F |   T   |      T       |          F             |\n\nNow, let's construct the truth table for the second proposition: \\(\\sim G \\equiv (\\sim H \\cdot G)\\)\n\nFirst, compute \\(\\sim G\\) and \\(\\sim H\\) for each combination, as before.\n\nThen, compute \\(\\sim H \\cdot G\\):\n\n- This is \\(\\sim H\\) AND \\(G\\)\n\n- So:\n\n- When \\(G = T\\), \\(\\sim H = F\\), so \\(F \\cdot T = F\\)\n\n- When \\(G = T\\), \\(\\sim H = T\\), so \\(T \\cdot T = T\\)\n\n- When \\(G = F\\), \\(\\sim H = F\\), so \\(F \\cdot F = F\\)\n\n- When \\(G = F\\), \\(\\sim H = T\\), so \\(T \\cdot F = F\\)\n\nThen, compute \\(\\sim G \\equiv (\\sim H \\cdot G)\\):\n\n- Recall that \\(A \\equiv B\\) is true when A and B have the same truth value.\n\n- So:\n\n- \\(\\sim G = F\\), \\((\\sim H \\cdot G) = F\\), so \\(F \\equiv F = T\\)\n\n- \\(\\sim G = F\\), \\((\\sim H \\cdot G) = T\\), so \\(F \\equiv T = F\\)\n\n- \\(\\sim G = T\\), \\((\\sim H \\cdot G) = F\\), so \\(T \\equiv F = F\\)\n\n- \\(\\sim G = T\\), \\((\\sim H \\cdot G) = F\\), so \\(T \\equiv F = F\\)\n\nSo, the truth table for \\(\\sim G \\equiv (\\sim H \\cdot G)\\) is:\n\n| G | H | \\sim G | \\sim H | \\sim H \u00b7 G | \\sim G \u2261 (\\sim H \u00b7 G) |\n|---|---|-------|-------|-----------|----------------------|\n| T | T |   F   |   F   |     F     |          T           |\n| T | F |   F   |   T   |     T     |          F           |\n| F | T |   T   |   F   |     F     |          F           |\n| F | F |   T   |   T   |     F     |          F           |\n\nNow, to determine the logical relationship between the two propositions, I need to compare their truth tables.\n\nLooking at the truth tables:\n\n- The first proposition: \\((G \\lor \\sim H) \\supset G\\) has the truth values: T, T, T, F\n\n- The second proposition: \\(\\sim G \\equiv (\\sim H \\cdot G)\\) has the truth values: T, F, F, F\n\nAre these propositions logically equivalent? No, because their truth values don't match in all rows.\n\nAre they contradictory? For two propositions to be contradictory, one must be true whenever the other is false, and vice versa. In other words, their truth values must be opposite in every row.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Row 1: T vs T (same)\n\n- Row 2: T vs F (different)\n\n- Row 3: T vs F (different)\n\n- Row 4: F vs F (same)\n\nSince they are not opposite in every row, they are not contradictory.\n\nNext, are they consistent? Two propositions are consistent if there is at least one row where both are true.\n\nLooking at row 1: both are T, so they are consistent.\n\nAre they inconsistent? Two propositions are inconsistent if there is no row where both are true. Since row 1 shows both true, they are not inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent.\n\nWait a minute, the options are:\n\nA. Logically equivalent\n\nB. Contradictory\n\nC. Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent\n\nD. Inconsistent\n\nBased on my analysis, it should be C.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I constructed the truth tables correctly based on the propositions.\n\nFor \\((G \\lor \\sim H) \\supset G\\):\n\n- \\(G \\lor \\sim H\\): OR of G and not H\n\n- Then, that result implies G\n\nFor \\(\\sim G \\equiv (\\sim H \\cdot G)\\):\n\n- Not G, and not H AND G, then check if they are equivalent.\n\nThe truth tables seem accurate.\n\nComparing the truth values:\n\n- They are not the same, so not equivalent.\n\n- They are not opposites, so not contradictory.\n\n- They are consistent because there is at least one row where both are true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
