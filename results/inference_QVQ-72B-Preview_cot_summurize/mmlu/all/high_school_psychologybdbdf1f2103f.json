                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Who would most likely have said, 'People are basically good'?\" And the options are:\n\nA. Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud\n\nB. Behaviorist B. F. Skinner\n\nC. Cognitivist Albert Ellis\n\nD. Humanist Carl Rogers\n\nHmm, I need to think about this. I'm not super familiar with all these psychologists, but I do remember some general ideas about their theories.\n\nFirst, let's recall a bit about each one:\n\nA. Sigmund Freud: He's the famous psychoanalyst who founded psychoanalysis. He thought that human behavior is influenced by unconscious motives and conflicts. I think he had a somewhat pessimistic view of human nature, didn't he? Something about the id, ego, and superego. The id is like our basic instincts, which can be selfish and impulsive. So, I don't think he had a very positive view of human nature. Maybe option A is not the best choice.\n\nB. B. F. Skinner: He's known for his work in behaviorism. Behaviorists focus on observable behaviors and how they are shaped by the environment and reinforcement. They believe that human behavior is primarily determined by external factors, not inherent goodness or badness. So, I don't think he would say people are basically good. Maybe not the right choice here.\n\nC. Albert Ellis: He's associated with cognitive therapy. He developed Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), which suggests that it's our thoughts and beliefs that influence our emotions and behaviors. I think he emphasized the importance of rational thinking to overcome emotional disturbances. But I don't recall him specifically stating that people are basically good. Maybe not the direct answer.\n\nD. Carl Rogers: He's a humanist psychologist, known for his client-centered therapy. Humanists believe in the inherent goodness of people and their potential for personal growth. They emphasize free will and the importance of individual experience. So, this sounds promising. Rogers believed that people are naturally inclined towards self-actualization, which is realizing their full potential. That seems to align with the idea that people are basically good.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any specific quote from Carl Rogers that says, \"People are basically good\"? I think he did say something along those lines. Let me see if I can recall or look it up in my notes.\n\nOkay, I found something. Carl Rogers once said, \"The basic core of the person is good, and that persons are basically trustworthy.\" That sounds very much like the phrase in the question, \"people are basically good.\" So, this seems to be a direct match.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other psychologists might have expressed similar views.\n\nFreud, as I thought earlier, had a more complex view of human nature, often highlighting the conflicts between our instinctual desires and societal norms. He didn't view people as inherently good; in fact, he thought that civilization was necessary to control our destructive impulses.\n\nB. F. Skinner was more about behavior modification based on environmental factors. He didn't focus much on intrinsic qualities like goodness or evil.\n\nAlbert Ellis, while positive about human potential, might not have explicitly stated that people are basically good. His approach was more about changing irrational beliefs to improve mental health.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, Carl Rogers is the most likely psychologist to have said, \"People are basically good.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
