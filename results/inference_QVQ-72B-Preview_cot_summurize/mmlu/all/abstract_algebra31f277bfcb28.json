                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out these two statements about group homomorphisms. I'm a bit rusty on group theory, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nFirst statement: \"The image of a group of 6 elements under a homomorphism may have 12 elements.\"\n\nHmm, that seems a bit off. I remember that in group theory, when you have a homomorphism from one group to another, the image of that homomorphism is a subgroup of the target group. So, if I have a group with 6 elements and a homomorphism, the image should be a subgroup of some group.\n\nWait a minute, is there a theorem about the size of the image compared to the original group? Oh, right! There's the First Isomorphism Theorem. It says that the image of a homomorphism is isomorphic to the quotient group of the domain by the kernel of the homomorphism. So, in formula terms, |im \u03c6| = |G| / |ker \u03c6|, where \u03c6 is the homomorphism, G is the domain, im \u03c6 is the image, and ker \u03c6 is the kernel.\n\nGiven that, if G has 6 elements, then |im \u03c6| = 6 / |ker \u03c6|. So, the possible sizes of the image are divisors of 6, which are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\nWait, but the statement suggests that the image could have 12 elements. According to this formula, that's not possible because 12 isn't a divisor of 6. Unless... is there some exception or special case where this could happen? Maybe if the homomorphism isn't onto, or something like that.\n\nLet me think again. The First Isomorphism Theorem applies to any homomorphism. It relates the image to the quotient group, and the sizes must satisfy |im \u03c6| = |G| / |ker \u03c6|. So, with |G| = 6, |im \u03c6| can only be 1, 2, 3, or 6, depending on the kernel's size.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible for the image to have 12 elements because 12 isn't a divisor of 6. Maybe unless the group is infinite or something, but no, G has 6 elements.\n\nSo, statement 1 is false.\n\nNow, statement 2: \"There is a homomorphism of some group of 6 elements into some group of 12 elements.\"\n\nOkay, this seems more straightforward. A homomorphism from a group of order 6 to a group of order 12. Is this possible?\n\nWell, yes, it's always possible to have a homomorphism between two groups. For any two groups, there exists at least the trivial homomorphism that maps everything to the identity element of the codomain.\n\nBut maybe the statement is asking if there's a non-trivial homomorphism. Even then, as long as the image is a subgroup of the codomain, and according to the First Isomorphism Theorem, the image must be isomorphic to a quotient group of the domain.\n\nGiven that, and knowing that the possible sizes of the image are 1, 2, 3, or 6, which all divide 12, there shouldn't be any issue constructing such homomorphisms.\n\nWait, but is there a group of order 6 that can be mapped into a group of order 12 in a homomorphic way?\n\nLet's consider the simplest case: the cyclic group of order 6, say Z6, and some group of order 12, like Z12.\n\nWe can define a homomorphism from Z6 to Z12. For example, mapping the generator of Z6 to an element of Z12 that generates a subgroup of order dividing 6.\n\nSince 6 divides 12, Z12 has a unique subgroup of order 6, which is generated by 2 (since 12/6=2). So, we can define a homomorphism \u03c6: Z6 \u2192 Z12 by \u03c6(1) = 2, where 1 is the generator of Z6.\n\nThis should be a valid homomorphism because it maps the generator to an element of the same order.\n\nAlternatively, we could map Z6 to Z12 in other ways, like mapping it to the trivial subgroup, but that's the trivial homomorphism.\n\nSo, in any case, it's possible to have a homomorphism from a group of order 6 to a group of order 12.\n\nTherefore, statement 2 is true.\n\nSo, combining both statements, statement 1 is false, and statement 2 is true.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct answer should be D. False, True.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIs there any possibility that the image of a group of 6 elements under a homomorphism could have 12 elements? According to the First Isomorphism Theorem, no, because 12 doesn't divide 6. Unless there's some non-injective homomorphism that somehow expands the image, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAnd for statement 2, I've given an example of a homomorphism from Z6 to Z12, which should suffice to confirm that such homomorphisms exist.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
