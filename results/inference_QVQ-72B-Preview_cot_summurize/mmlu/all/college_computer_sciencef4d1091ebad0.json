                    "text": "So I have this question about interrupts, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let's see, interrupts are like signals that tell the CPU something important has happened or needs attention. I remember learning about them in my computer architecture class, but it's been a while. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that interrupts are generated when memory cycles are \"stolen.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit odd. I'm not sure what it means by \"stolen\" memory cycles. Maybe it's referring to direct memory access (DMA), where devices can access memory directly without going through the CPU. In DMA, the device essentially takes control of the memory bus to transfer data, which could be seen as \"stealing\" memory cycles from the CPU. But is this related to interrupts? I think DMA can generate interrupts to signal the CPU that a transfer has been completed, but it's not the same as interrupts being generated when memory cycles are stolen. Maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nOption B says that interrupts are used in place of data channels. I'm not entirely sure what this means. Data channels could refer to communication paths between devices and the CPU, like buses or serial ports. Interrupts are used to signal events, not to replace data channels themselves. They can be used alongside data channels to indicate when data is ready to be read or written, but they aren't a substitute for the channels themselves. So, probably not the right answer.\n\nOption C says that interrupts can indicate the completion of an I/O operation. This sounds familiar. When a device finishes reading or writing data, it often signals the CPU via an interrupt to let it know that the operation is done. For example, if you're reading from a disk drive, the disk controller might raise an interrupt to say that the data is ready to be processed. That makes sense, so this could be a correct option.\n\nOption D says that interrupts cannot be generated by arithmetic operations. Well, arithmetic operations can certainly cause interrupts or exceptions, especially if there's an error during the operation. For instance, in many systems, attempting to divide by zero will trigger an interrupt or an exception to handle the error. So, arithmetic operations can generate interrupts under certain circumstances. Therefore, this statement seems incorrect.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C seems to be the most accurate statement about interrupts. They can indeed indicate the completion of an I/O operation, which is a common and important use of interrupts in computer systems.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
