                    "text": "So I have this question about snails and different types of selection. The snails are either cream-colored or solid brown, and intermediate individuals are rare. I need to figure out which type of selection this best describes. The options are artificial selection, directional selection, stabilizing selection, and disruptive selection.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each type of selection means.\n\nArtificial selection is when humans breed organisms with specific traits to produce desired characteristics. Like breeding dogs for certain traits or growing plants that are resistant to diseases. In this case, it's about snails in nature, not influenced by humans, so I don't think artificial selection applies here. Maybe eliminate option A.\n\nDirectional selection seems like selection where one extreme trait is favored over another, leading to a shift in the population over time. For example, if brown snails are better camouflaged and survive better, then over time, more snails would be brown. But in this scenario, both cream and brown are common, with intermediates being rare. So, maybe not directional selection. Eliminate option B.\n\nStabilizing selection is when the intermediate traits are favored, and the extremes are selected against. For example, in humans, babies with average birth weights survive better than those with very low or very high birth weights. But in this snail case, intermediates are rare, meaning that the extremes are being favored, not the middle. So, probably not stabilizing selection. Eliminate option C.\n\nDisruptive selection is when both extreme traits are favored, and the intermediates are selected against. This leads to a bimodal distribution, meaning two peaks in the trait frequency, which matches the description of the snails being mostly cream or solid brown, with few intermediates.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like disruptive selection is the best answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nPerhaps the cream and brown colors are adaptations to different environments. For example, in certain habitats, cream color provides better camouflage, while in others, brown does. So, there might be frequency-dependent selection, where the rarer color has an advantage because predators might not be as used to it.\n\nBut that seems more like frequency-dependent selection, which isn't one of the options. So, maybe that's not the right track.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a genetic basis where the genes for cream and brown are dominant or recessive in different ways, leading to the rarity of intermediates.\n\nBut the question is about selection, not genetics per se.\n\nLet me think about the graph of this distribution. If I plot the frequency of snail colors, I'd see two peaks, one for cream and one for brown, with a low frequency in between, where the intermediates are.\n\nThat's characteristic of disruptive selection, where selection favors individuals at both extremes and selects against those in the middle.\n\nIn disruptive selection, this can lead to the evolution of multiple forms within a population, potentially even leading to speciation if the forms become reproductively isolated.\n\nGiven that, I think disruptive selection is the most appropriate choice here.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there could be any other factors at play.\n\nMaybe environmental factors cause the snails to be cream or brown. For example, diet or habitat could influence their color. But even if that's the case, the selection is still acting on the phenotypes that are present.\n\nUnless there's some external pressure that's favoring the extremes, which sounds like disruptive selection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a balance between predation and visibility. Maybe in some environments, cream blends in better, and in others, brown does, leading to a split in the population.\n\nAgain, that points towards disruptive selection, where different environments favor different traits.\n\nI don't think it's directional selection because in that case, we'd expect one color to become more common over time, not two coexisting.\n\nStabilizing selection would predict that intermediates are more common, which isn't the case here.\n\nArtificial selection doesn't apply because we're talking about a natural population without human intervention.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D. disruptive selection.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
