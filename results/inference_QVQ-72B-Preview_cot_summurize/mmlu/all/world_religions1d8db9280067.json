                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of the following movements was founded by Mordechai Kaplan? A. Liberal Judaism, B. Reform Judaism, C. Conservative Judaism, D. Reconstructionist Judaism.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these Jewish movements Mordechai Kaplan founded. I'm not super familiar with all the different branches of Judaism, but I think I can work this out.\n\nFirst off, I know that Judaism has several main branches or movements. There's Orthodox Judaism, which is pretty traditional, and then there are more progressive movements like Reform and Conservative Judaism. I've also heard of Reconstructionist Judaism, but I'm not as familiar with that one. Maybe that's the one Mordechai Kaplan founded?\n\nLet me think about this step by step. I should probably start by eliminating the options that I know weren't founded by Mordechai Kaplan.\n\nOption A is Liberal Judaism. I'm not sure about this one. Liberal Judaism sounds similar to Reform Judaism, which I know is one of the major movements. Maybe they're the same thing, or maybe Liberal Judaism is a subgroup. I need to clarify that.\n\nOption B is Reform Judaism. I know that Reform Judaism is one of the largest and most liberal branches of Judaism. It was founded in Germany in the 19th century, I think. Mordechai Kaplan was an American rabbi in the 20th century, so maybe he was involved in Reform Judaism, but I don't think he founded it.\n\nOption C is Conservative Judaism. This is another major branch, more traditional than Reform but less so than Orthodox. It was also founded in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Mordechai Kaplan was involved in Conservative Judaism at some point, but I think he eventually broke away from it.\n\nOption D is Reconstructionist Judaism. This one sounds the most promising. I've heard that Mordechai Kaplan is often associated with Reconstructionist Judaism, and I think he might have founded it. But I should make sure.\n\nOkay, let me do a quick search in my mind. I recall that Mordechai Kaplan was a prominent Jewish thinker and rabbi who emphasized Jewish culture and ethics over just religious observance. He had ideas about Judaism being a civilization rather than just a religion. That sounds a bit different from the traditional views in Orthodox Judaism.\n\nI also remember that he was critical of some aspects of Conservative Judaism, which was the movement he was initially part of. He felt that Conservative Judaism didn't go far enough in adapting Jewish practice to modern life. So, maybe that's why he went on to found Reconstructionist Judaism.\n\nLet me consider the timeline. Mordechai Kaplan was born in 1881 and died in 1983. Reconstructionist Judaism was founded in the 1930s, I think, which would make sense given his lifespan.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should check if Liberal Judaism is a separate movement or if it's another name for Reform Judaism. I think Liberal Judaism is actually a movement in the United Kingdom, separate from Reform Judaism in the United States. So, that might be a distractor in this question.\n\nReform Judaism was founded much earlier, in the 19th century in Germany, so that's definitely not founded by Kaplan.\n\nConservative Judaism was founded in the United States in the late 19th century, again before Kaplan's time.\n\nReconstructionist Judaism, on the other hand, was indeed founded by Mordechai Kaplan in the 1930s. He developed the idea that Judaism is not just a religion but a civilization that includes religious, cultural, and ethical dimensions.\n\nSo, based on this information, it seems clear that Mordechai Kaplan founded Reconstructionist Judaism.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that. Maybe I'm confusing him with someone else. Let me see if I can recall any details about the founding of Reconstructionist Judaism.\n\nYes, I think Mordechai Kaplan is correctly credited with founding Reconstructionist Judaism. He was a professor at the Jewish Theological Seminary, which is associated with Conservative Judaism, but he eventually broke away to establish his own ideas.\n\nHe published a book called \"Judaism as a Civilization\" in 1934, which outlined his vision for a new approach to Judaism that emphasized Jewish peoplehood and culture alongside religious practice.\n\nBased on this, it seems that Reconstructionist Judaism is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I'll consider if there's any possibility that he founded another movement. For example, maybe he was involved in the founding of other organizations or movements within Judaism, but I don't recall any specific ones.\n\nNo, I think it's safe to say that Mordechai Kaplan founded Reconstructionist Judaism.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Reconstructionist Judaism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
