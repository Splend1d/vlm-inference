Caricature, C. Still life, D. Impressionism. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a caricature is. From what I recall, a caricature is a type of art where the artist exaggerates certain features of a person, usually for humorous effect. So, it sounds like it fits the description in the question. But just to be sure, I should check each option.\n\nOption A is \"landscape.\" I know that a landscape is a painting or drawing of natural scenery like mountains, rivers, trees, etc. It doesn't involve portraits or exaggerating physical traits of people. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nOption B is \"caricature.\" As I thought earlier, caricatures are known for exaggerating features. They can be done in various styles, but the main idea is to emphasize or distort certain aspects of a person's appearance in a comedic way. This seems to match the description perfectly.\n\nOption C is \"still life.\" Still life paintings depict inanimate objects arranged in a specific way, often to tell a story or convey a certain mood. They don't involve people or their portraits, so this doesn't fit the description.\n\nOption D is \"impressionism.\" Impressionism is an art movement that focuses on capturing the impression of a moment, often with brushstrokes that convey light and color. While impressionist paintings can include people, they don't typically exaggerate physical traits in a comedic manner.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, it seems like the correct answer is B. Caricature. Just to double-check, I'll think of some examples. For instance, political cartoons often use caricatures to exaggerate politicians' features for satire. Another example is celebrity caricatures in magazines, which playfully exaggerate stars' physical characteristics.\n\nYeah, that all lines up. I don't think there's any confusion here. The question is pretty straightforward, and the answer clearly matches the definition of a caricature.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. Caricature}} \\]"
