                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a normally distributed random variable X with a mean (\u03bc) of 25 and a standard deviation (\u03c3) of 4. We need to find the approximate interquartile range (IQR) for this distribution.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the interquartile range is. The interquartile range is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). So, IQR = Q3 - Q1.\n\nIn a normal distribution, the quartiles can be found using the mean and standard deviation. I remember that for a normal distribution, the first quartile (Q1) is located at approximately the mean minus 0.675 standard deviations, and the third quartile (Q3) is at the mean plus 0.675 standard deviations.\n\nLet me confirm that. Actually, the exact z-scores for Q1 and Q3 are approximately -0.6745 and +0.6745, respectively, since quartiles divide the data into quarters, and each quarter has 25% of the data.\n\nSo, to find Q1 and Q3, I can use these z-scores with the given mean and standard deviation.\n\nThe formula to find a value corresponding to a given z-score is:\n\nX = \u03bc + (z * \u03c3)\n\nWhere:\n\n- X is the value\n\n- \u03bc is the mean\n\n- z is the z-score\n\n- \u03c3 is the standard deviation\n\nFirst, let's find Q1:\n\nz1 = -0.6745\n\n\u03c3 = 4\n\n\u03bc = 25\n\nSo, Q1 = 25 + (-0.6745 * 4)\n\nCalculate that:\n\nQ1 = 25 - (0.6745 * 4)\n\n0.6745 * 4 is approximately 2.698\n\nSo, Q1 \u2248 25 - 2.7 = 22.3\n\nNow, let's find Q3:\n\nz3 = +0.6745\n\n\u03c3 = 4\n\n\u03bc = 25\n\nSo, Q3 = 25 + (0.6745 * 4)\n\nQ3 \u2248 25 + 2.7 = 27.7\n\nTherefore, Q1 is approximately 22.3 and Q3 is approximately 27.7.\n\nNow, the interquartile range (IQR) is Q3 - Q1:\n\nIQR \u2248 27.7 - 22.3 = 5.4\n\nSo, the approximate interquartile range is 5.4.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 25.00 \u2013 22.30 = 2.70\n\nB. 27.70 \u2013 22.30 = 5.40\n\nC. 27.70 \u00f7 22.30 = 1.24\n\nD. 2.00(4.00) = 8.00\n\nOption B matches our calculation.\n\nBut let's make sure there isn't a better way or if there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I know that in a normal distribution, the interquartile range can also be calculated using the formula:\n\nIQR = 2 * \u03c3 * \u03a6^-1(0.75)\n\nWhere \u03a6^-1 is the inverse cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.\n\nBut since I used the z-scores for Q1 and Q3, my approach should be sufficient and accurate enough for this problem.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to recall that in a normal distribution, the IQR is roughly equal to 1.35 times the standard deviation.\n\nSo, IQR \u2248 1.35 * \u03c3\n\nGiven \u03c3 = 4\n\nIQR \u2248 1.35 * 4 = 5.4\n\nAgain, this confirms our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 27.70 \u2013 22.30 = 5.40.\n\nLet me just double-check if any of the other options make sense.\n\nOption A is 25.00 \u2013 22.30 = 2.70, which seems to be subtracting Q1 from the mean, which isn't related to the IQR.\n\nOption C is 27.70 \u00f7 22.30 = 1.24, which seems to be dividing Q3 by Q1, but that doesn't relate to IQR.\n\nOption D is 2.00(4.00) = 8.00, which seems to be 2 times the standard deviation, but that's not the IQR.\n\nTherefore, option B is indeed the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
