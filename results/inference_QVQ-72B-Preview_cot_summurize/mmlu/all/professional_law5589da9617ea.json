                    "text": "So Connie bought a laptop for $1,000 and got a 5-year service agreement for $1,200, making the total $2,200. Nine months later, the laptop broke down, and Computer Retailer said they wouldn't honor the service agreement. Now, Connie wants to sue them. The question is about which legal framework would likely be applied in this situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the nature of the contract between Connie and Computer Retailer. She bought a laptop (a good) and a service agreement (a service). So, it's a mixed contract involving both goods and services.\n\nThe question mentions the UCC, which is the Uniform Commercial Code, a set of laws that govern sales and other commercial transactions in the United States. The UCC is primarily concerned with the sale of goods, which are tangible items intended for resale or use in production.\n\nCommon law, on the other hand, refers to the body of law developed by courts through decisions in individual cases, rather than through legislative statutes.\n\nIn this case, since there's a mix of goods and services, it's not entirely clear whether the UCC applies or if it's more of a service contract governed by common law.\n\nThe question provides options that mention the \"predominate purpose\" of the contract. This seems key to determining whether the contract is primarily about the sale of goods or the provision of services.\n\nOption A says Connie would win under common law because the main purpose was the sale of goods. But wait, common law typically governs service contracts, while the UCC governs sales of goods. So, if the main purpose was the sale of goods, shouldn't the UCC apply?\n\nOption B says Connie would win under the UCC only if the main reason for the contract was for the goods portion. This suggests that if the goods part is predominant, the UCC applies, otherwise, maybe common law applies.\n\nOption C says Connie would win under the UCC unless the main purpose was for the service agreement. This seems similar to option B but with a different phrasing.\n\nOption D says Computer Retailer would win if the court determines that the main purpose is based on intent rather than the dollar amounts assigned to the computer and the service agreement.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. I need to think more carefully.\n\nLet me recall that in mixed contracts involving both goods and services, courts often look to the \"predominant purpose\" test to determine whether the contract is primarily for goods or services. This test helps decide whether the UCC applies or if it's a common law contract.\n\nThe UCC generally applies to contracts whose primary purpose is the sale of goods. If the primary purpose is the provision of services, then common law principles would apply.\n\nIn this case, Connie bought a laptop (a good) and a service agreement (a service). The total cost was $2,200, with $1,000 for the laptop and $1,200 for the service agreement. So, the service agreement costs more than the laptop itself.\n\nBut just looking at the dollar amounts might not be the only factor. The court might consider the nature of the transaction. Was the service agreement incidental to the sale of the laptop, or was it a significant part of the deal?\n\nOption A suggests that under common law, Connie would win because the main purpose was the sale of goods. But common law typically governs services, not goods. So, if the main purpose was the sale of goods, shouldn't the UCC apply?\n\nOption B says Connie would win under the UCC only if the main reason for the contract was for the goods portion. This implies that if the goods are the primary part, the UCC applies, and Connie would prevail. But it's not clear why only under the UCC, not under common law.\n\nOption C says Connie would win under the UCC unless the main purpose was for the service agreement. This seems to suggest that unless the service agreement is the primary purpose, the UCC applies.\n\nOption D says Computer Retailer would win if the court looks at intent rather than dollar amounts. But why would that favor Computer Retailer?\n\nI need to think about this differently. Maybe the key is whether the service agreement is considered part of the sale of the laptop or a separate contract.\n\nIf the service agreement is considered part of the sale of the laptop, then the entire contract might be seen as a sale of goods with additional services, and the UCC would apply.\n\nIf the service agreement is seen as a separate contract for services, then common law would apply to that part.\n\nBut in this case, since both were purchased together, it's likely that the court would consider the entire transaction under the UCC if the laptop is the primary subject of the contract.\n\nOption C seems to suggest that Connie would win under the UCC unless the main purpose was for the service agreement. So, if the main purpose was for the laptop, Connie would win under the UCC.\n\nOption B says Connie would win under the UCC only if the main reason was for the goods portion. So, similar to option C, but phrased differently.\n\nOption A mentions common law, which might not be the primary applicable law here since goods are involved.\n\nOption D suggests that if the court determines that the main purpose is based on intent rather than dollar amounts, Computer Retailer would win. But why would that favor Computer Retailer?\n\nPerhaps if the intent was that the service agreement was the primary purpose, then Computer Retailer would win under common law. But that seems speculative.\n\nI think the best answer is Option C: Connie, under the UCC unless the predominate purpose of the agreement was for the service agreement portion of the contract.\n\nThis means that as long as the primary purpose was the sale of the laptop (the goods), the UCC applies, and Connie would prevail. Only if the service agreement was the primary purpose would common law apply, and perhaps Computer Retailer could have a defense.\n\nSo, in this case, since the laptop was the main item purchased, and the service agreement was an additional component, it's likely that the UCC would apply, and Connie would win.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
