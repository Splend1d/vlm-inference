                    "text": "So Miranda has enlarged a picture proportionally. The original picture is 4 cm wide and 6 cm long. The new picture is 10 cm wide, and we need to find out its length. The options are 8 cm, 12 cm, 15 cm, and 20 cm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to enlarge something proportionally. If something is enlarged proportionally, that means the ratios of the corresponding dimensions should stay the same. So, the width and the length should scale by the same factor.\n\nSo, in this case, the width goes from 4 cm to 10 cm. To find the scale factor, I can divide the new width by the original width. That is, scale factor = new width / original width = 10 cm / 4 cm = 2.5.\n\nNow, to find the new length, I should multiply the original length by this scale factor. So, new length = original length * scale factor = 6 cm * 2.5 = 15 cm.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 15 cm seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check this. Maybe I can approach it another way to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAnother way to think about proportional enlargement is to set up a proportion equation. The ratio of the width to the length should be the same before and after enlargement.\n\nSo, original width / original length = new width / new length.\n\nPlugging in the known values: 4 cm / 6 cm = 10 cm / new length.\n\nSolving for the new length, I can cross-multiply: 4 cm * new length = 6 cm * 10 cm.\n\nSo, new length = (6 cm * 10 cm) / 4 cm = 60 cm\u00b2 / 4 cm = 15 cm.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous result of 15 cm. So, I'm pretty confident that the correct answer is 15 cm.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other factor that could affect this. Since the problem states that the picture is enlarged proportionally, and we're only dealing with width and length, assuming it's a two-dimensional enlargement, I don't think there are any other factors to consider here.\n\nAlso, let me check the units to make sure. Both the original and new dimensions are in centimeters, so that checks out.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the aspect ratio. The aspect ratio of the original picture is 4:6, which simplifies to 2:3. The new picture should have the same aspect ratio, so its width to length ratio should also be 2:3.\n\nGiven that the new width is 10 cm, which corresponds to the '2' in the ratio, I can set up a proportion: 2/3 = 10 / new length.\n\nSolving for new length: new length = (10 * 3) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15 cm.\n\nAgain, this confirms the answer is 15 cm.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the scale factor for the width, which is 10 cm / 4 cm = 2.5, and apply it to the length, 6 cm * 2.5 = 15 cm, I get the same answer.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to see if the new width and length form the same ratio as the original width and length.\n\nSo, original ratio: 4 cm (width) to 6 cm (length), which is 4:6 or 2:3.\n\nNew width is 10 cm, so what should the length be to maintain the 2:3 ratio? Let's set up the proportion: 2/3 = 10 / new length.\n\nAgain, solving for new length gives 15 cm.\n\nAll these methods point to 15 cm being the correct answer.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's plug in the numbers into the options.\n\nOption A is 8 cm. Does 4 cm wide to 6 cm long scale to 10 cm wide to 8 cm long? That would be a scale factor of 2.5 for width (10 / 4 = 2.5), and for length it would be 6 / 8 = 0.75. Not equal, so not proportional.\n\nOption B is 12 cm. Scale factor for width is 10 / 4 = 2.5, and for length it would be 6 / 12 = 0.5. Not equal, so not proportional.\n\nOption C is 15 cm. Scale factor for width is 10 / 4 = 2.5, and for length it's 6 / 15 = 0.4. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, if I'm scaling up, I should be multiplying by the scale factor, not dividing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of multiplication. If width new = original width * scale factor, and length new = original length * scale factor, then scale factor = new width / original width = 10 / 4 = 2.5.\n\nThen, new length = 6 * 2.5 = 15 cm.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, option C. 15 cm is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've covered multiple ways to approach this problem and each one leads to the same conclusion. Therefore, I'm confident that 15 cm is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15 \\text{ cm}} \\]"
