A 10 percent increase in income produces a 15 percent increase in consumption of DVDs. DVDs are a normal luxury good.\n\nB. A 10 percent increase in income produces a 15 percent increase in consumption of DVDs. DVDs are an inferior good.\n\nC. A 10 percent increase in income produces a 15 percent decrease in consumption of DVDs. DVDs are an inferior good.\n\nD. A 10 percent increase in the price of DVDs produces a 15 percent decrease in consumption of DVDs. DVDs are a price elastic good.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what income elasticity is. From what I remember, income elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in consumers' income. The formula is:\n\nIncome elasticity (\u03b7) = Percentage change in quantity demanded / Percentage change in income\n\nSo, if \u03b7 is positive, it means that the good is a normal good. If \u03b7 is negative, it's an inferior good.\n\nNow, in this case, \u03b7 is +1.5, which is positive, so DVDs must be a normal good. That eliminates options C and D, because they suggest DVDs are inferior goods or talking about price elasticity instead of income elasticity.\n\nBetween A and B, A says that a 10% increase in income leads to a 15% increase in consumption of DVDs, and it correctly identifies DVDs as a normal luxury good. B says the same thing but then incorrectly labels DVDs as an inferior good.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check what constitutes a luxury good. I think luxury goods are normal goods that have an income elasticity greater than 1. So, if \u03b7 > 1, it's considered a luxury good because demand increases more than proportionally with income.\n\nIn this case, \u03b7 = 1.5, which is greater than 1, so DVDs would be considered a luxury good.\n\nOption A reflects this correctly: a 10% increase in income leads to a 15% increase in consumption, and it correctly classifies DVDs as a normal luxury good.\n\nOption B contradicts itself by stating the same relationship but then calling DVDs an inferior good, which doesn't make sense because inferior goods have negative income elasticity.\n\nOption C is clearly incorrect because it suggests a decrease in consumption with an increase in income, which would imply negative income elasticity, making it an inferior good, but the given elasticity is positive.\n\nOption D is talking about price elasticity, which is a different concept. Price elasticity measures how quantity demanded responds to changes in price, not income. So, that's not relevant here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A: a 10 percent increase in income produces a 15 percent increase in consumption of DVDs, and DVDs are a normal luxury good.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any chance that \u03b7 could be interpreted differently. No, I don't think so. The income elasticity is given as +1.5, which means that for a 1% increase in income, quantity demanded increases by 1.5%. So, for a 10% increase in income, quantity demanded increases by 15%. And since \u03b7 > 1, it's a luxury good.\n\nI don't see any flaws in this reasoning. I'm confident that option A is the correct one.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
