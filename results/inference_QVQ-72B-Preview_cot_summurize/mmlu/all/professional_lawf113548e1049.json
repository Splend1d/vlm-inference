                    "text": "Let's dive into this legal scenario. So, we have a doctor who owns a two-acre tract just outside the city. She subdivides it into 12 lots, sells 11 of them to different buyers, and keeps lot 12 for herself. Each of the deeds for the sold lots has a restriction saying that the property can only be used for single-family residences. So, everyone builds houses on their lots.\n\nTwo years after the subdivision and sales, all the lot owners have built their homes. In December of that year, the doctor digs a well on her property and starts supplying water to all the lot owners. That's interesting\u2014she's providing water to her neighbors.\n\nThen, one year later, the veterinarian who lives next to the doctor digs a well in her backyard. This action causes water to be diverted from the doctor's well, and as a result, the doctor can no longer get any water from her well. Now, the doctor is considering legal action against the veterinarian.\n\nSo, the question is, in an appropriate legal action by the doctor against the veterinarian, what remedy, if any, is available? The options are:\n\nA. An injunction should be decreed enjoining the veterinarian from using her well.\n\nB. The doctor should be entitled to recover money damages from the veterinarian.\n\nC. The veterinarian should be required to supply water to the doctor.\n\nD. There is no remedy.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the relationship between the parties and the properties involved. The doctor owns lot 12 and has been supplying water to the other lot owners from her well. The veterinarian owns one of the adjacent lots and has dug her own well, which has apparently diverted water from the doctor's well, rendering it useless.\n\nNow, the doctor wants to take legal action against the veterinarian for this issue. We need to determine what kind of legal remedy she might be entitled to.\n\nLet's consider the possible remedies one by one.\n\nOption A suggests that an injunction should be decreed to stop the veterinarian from using her well. An injunction is an equitable remedy that can be ordered by a court to prevent someone from doing something that would cause harm to another party. In this case, if the veterinarian's use of her well is causing harm to the doctor by depriving her of water, an injunction might be a suitable remedy.\n\nBut we need to think about whether there's a legal basis for such an injunction. Is there a restriction or agreement that prevents the veterinarian from digging a well on her property?\n\nWell, the deeds have a restriction that the properties are to be used only for single-family residences. Does that restriction somehow limit the use of the property in a way that would prohibit digging a well? Maybe not directly, because digging a well could be seen as part of maintaining a single-family residence, especially if it's for water supply.\n\nSo, perhaps the restriction doesn't directly prohibit digging a well. Maybe there's another angle.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps there's an implied easement or some sort of reciprocal right to water since the doctor was supplying water to the other lot owners. But the veterinarian dug her own well, which might be within her rights as a property owner.\n\nWait, but if the veterinarian's well is interfering with the doctor's well, maybe there's an issue with subsurface water rights. In many places, water rights can be complex, involving both surface water and groundwater.\n\nPerhaps the doctor has a right to the groundwater under her property, and the veterinarian's well is interfering with that right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a covenant or agreement among the lot owners that governs water usage or well drilling.\n\nLet's think about the fact that the doctor was supplying water to the other lot owners. Maybe there's an implied obligation or agreement that the veterinarian should continue to receive water from the doctor, or perhaps that she shouldn't interfere with the doctor's water supply.\n\nBut the veterinarian dug her own well, which is a permanent solution for her water needs, and in doing so, she diverted water from the doctor's well.\n\nSo, is there a legal principle that prevents a landowner from using their property in a way that harms their neighbor's use and enjoyment?\n\nYes, in property law, there's the concept of nuisance, which can include actions that unreasonably interfere with a neighbor's use and enjoyment of their property.\n\nIn this case, the veterinarian's well has completely deprived the doctor of her water supply, which is a significant interference with her use and enjoyment of her property.\n\nSo, perhaps the doctor can bring a nuisance claim against the veterinarian.\n\nIf that's the case, what remedy would be appropriate?\n\nAn injunction is often a remedy in nuisance cases to stop the activity that's causing the interference.\n\nSo, option A seems plausible.\n\nBut let's consider option B: the doctor should be entitled to recover money damages from the veterinarian.\n\nDamages are another common remedy in legal disputes, intended to compensate the injured party for their losses.\n\nIn this scenario, the doctor has lost her water supply, which is a significant loss. She might have to drill a new well or find another source of water, which could be costly.\n\nSo, awarding damages to compensate for the cost of drilling a new well or other expenses related to obtaining water could be a possible remedy.\n\nHowever, damages might not fully restore the doctor's water supply, especially if the water table has been affected by the veterinarian's well.\n\nTherefore, an injunction to stop the veterinarian from using her well might be a more effective remedy to prevent ongoing harm.\n\nBut, on the other hand, the veterinarian has dug a well on her own property, which she might need for her own water supply.\n\nSo, perhaps a court would balance the interests of both parties and find a solution that minimizes harm to both.\n\nOption C suggests that the veterinarian should be required to supply water to the doctor.\n\nThis seems a bit unusual. Generally, courts don't like to order ongoing affirmative actions, especially if they require continued cooperation between parties who are in dispute.\n\nMoreover, the veterinarian has her own well, but it's not clear if that well can supply enough water for both properties or if there are any legal obligations for her to do so.\n\nIt's possible that the veterinarian doesn't have an obligation to supply water to the doctor, even if her well has affected the doctor's water supply.\n\nTherefore, this option seems less likely.\n\nOption D states that there is no remedy.\n\nGiven that the veterinarian's actions have directly caused harm to the doctor's property by depriving it of water, it's unlikely that there's no remedy at all.\n\nCourts generally provide some form of relief when one party's actions cause significant harm to another's property rights.\n\nTherefore, option D seems unlikely.\n\nBetween options A and B, which one is more appropriate?\n\nAn injunction would prevent the veterinarian from using her well, which might resolve the water diversion issue and potentially restore the doctor's water supply.\n\nHowever, the veterinarian also needs water for her own use, so prohibiting her from using her well might not be a practical solution unless there's another source of water available to her.\n\nAlternatively, damages would compensate the doctor for her losses but might not restore her water supply.\n\nPerhaps a combination of remedies could be considered, such as ordering the veterinarian to take steps to mitigate the impact on the doctor's well or to contribute to the cost of the doctor drilling a new well.\n\nBut based on the options provided, it seems that an injunction is the most direct remedy to stop the harm.\n\nTherefore, option A seems to be the most appropriate remedy in this scenario.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
