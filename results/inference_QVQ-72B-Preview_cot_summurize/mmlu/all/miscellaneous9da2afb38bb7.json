                    "text": "Let's see here. The question is asking about a famous folksinger who founded the Institute for the Study of Non-Violence in 1965. The options are Bob Dylan, Woody Guthrie, Joan Baez, and Peter Yarrow. Hmm, I need to recall which one of these artists was involved in founding such an institute.\n\nFirst, I should probably look up some information about each of these folksingers to see if they have a connection to the Institute for the Study of Non-Violence. Starting with Bob Dylan, I know he was a prominent figure in the folk music scene in the 1960s and was involved in the civil rights movement. He wrote songs like \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"The Times They Are A-Changin'\" that became anthems for peace and social justice. But I don't remember him founding an institute specifically dedicated to non-violence.\n\nNext, Woody Guthrie. He was another famous folksinger, known for songs like \"This Land Is Your Land.\" He was active in the 1930s and 1940s and was involved in various social causes. However, I don't recall him founding the Institute for the Study of Non-Violence either. Maybe he was more focused on other types of activism.\n\nThen there's Joan Baez. She was also a key figure in the folk music movement and was known for her activism in non-violence and civil rights. I seem to recall that she was involved in various peace movements and even went to India to study non-violent resistance. Let me think\u2014could she have founded the Institute for the Study of Non-Violence?\n\nLastly, Peter Yarrow. He was part of the folk group Peter, Paul, and Mary, which was popular in the 1960s. They sang songs like \"Puff, the Magic Dragon\" and \"Blowin' in the Wind.\" I know he was involved in social causes, but I don't think he founded the institute in question.\n\nLet me consider the timeline. The institute was founded in 1965. That was a time when many artists were deeply involved in social and political issues, particularly the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. Both Bob Dylan and Joan Baez were actively participating in protests and benefit concerts during that period.\n\nWait a minute, I think Joan Baez was particularly interested in non-violence. I remember that she was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., both advocates of non-violent resistance. In fact, she was involved in the March on Washington in 1963, where King delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech. She also went to India in 1962 to study non-violence.\n\nLet me try to verify this. If she founded the Institute for the Study of Non-Violence in 1965, it would make sense given her background and interests at that time. Bob Dylan, while also involved in civil rights, was more known for his songwriting and performing at benefit concerts rather than founding educational institutions.\n\nWoody Guthrie, being older and having passed away in 1967, was less active in the 1960s. Although he was a influential folksinger, his prime years were before 1965. Peter Yarrow, while active in social causes, doesn't seem to have founded the institute in question.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, Joan Baez seems like the most likely candidate to have founded the Institute for the Study of Non-Violence in 1965. Her dedication to non-violent protest and her involvement in various peace movements align perfectly with the institute's mission.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any information about the institute itself. If it was founded in 1965 by Joan Baez, there should be records or references to her involvement. Perhaps I can look up the history of the institute or find any statements from Joan Baez regarding its establishment.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for biographies or interviews with Joan Baez from around that time to confirm her involvement. I recall that she was quite active in the peace movement during the 1960s, so it would be consistent with her activities in that period.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information I can recall and the timeline of events, I'm confident that Joan Baez is the famous folksinger who founded the Institute for the Study of Non-Violence in 1965.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C.
