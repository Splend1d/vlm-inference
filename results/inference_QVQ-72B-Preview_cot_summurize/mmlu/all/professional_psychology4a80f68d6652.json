                    "text": "Okay, so I have this question about individuals with moderate mental retardation. It gives four options and I need to pick which one is correct. Let me read them again to make sure I understand.\n\nOption A says they constitute 2% to 3% of the mentally retarded population. Hmm, I think I remember that the prevalence of mental retardation decreases as the severity increases. So, if mild retardation is more common, then moderate would be less common, maybe around 1% or something. But I'm not sure about the exact percentage.\n\nOption B says they can be trained to perform unskilled work under close supervision. That sounds plausible. I imagine that with support and structure, individuals with moderate intellectual disabilities can learn basic job skills, maybe in a sheltered workshop or a supervised environment.\n\nOption C states they usually acquire academic skills up to approximately eighth-grade level. Well, academic skills can vary a lot depending on the person and the support they receive. Some might reach that level, but others might not. I'm not sure if it's accurate to say \"usually\" up to eighth-grade level.\n\nOption D mentions they display minimal or no impairment in sensorimotor functioning. Sensorimotor functioning relates to senses and movement, right? So, if someone has moderate mental retardation, does that necessarily mean they have problems with seeing, hearing, or moving? I don't think so. I believe intellectual disability and sensory or motor impairments are separate issues, though they can co-occur.\n\nLet me think again. The question is about individuals with moderate mental retardation, and I need to choose which statement is correct.\n\nOption A: 2% - 3% of the mentally retarded population. I'm not sure about the percentage, but maybe it's in that range.\n\nOption B: Can be trained to do unskilled work under supervision. That seems reasonable.\n\nOption C: Acquire academic skills up to eighth-grade level. Might be variable.\n\nOption D: Minimal or no sensorimotor impairment. Not necessarily, I think.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up some definitions to confirm.\n\nI recall that mental retardation, or intellectual disability, is typically classified into different levels based on IQ scores and adaptive functioning. The levels are usually mild, moderate, severe, and profound.\n\nFor moderate intellectual disability, the IQ range is generally between 35-49, and there are significant limitations in adaptive skills.\n\nIn terms of education and employment, individuals with moderate intellectual disability often require more support than those with mild disabilities.\n\nSo, looking back at Option A, it says they constitute 2% - 3% of the mentally retarded population. I think the distribution of intellectual disability is such that milder forms are more common, and as severity increases, the percentage decreases.\n\nAccording to some prevalence data, mild intellectual disability might be around 1-3%, moderate around 0.5%, severe around 0.25%, and profound around 0.1% or less. So, Option A's 2% - 3% seems a bit high for moderate retardation.\n\nMoving on to Option B: Can be trained to perform unskilled work under close supervision.\n\nThis seems consistent with what I know. With appropriate training and supervision, many individuals with moderate intellectual disability can learn to do basic tasks in a work setting, perhaps in a sheltered workshop or a supported employment program.\n\nSo, Option B appears to be correct.\n\nOption C: Usually acquire academic skills up to approximately eighth-grade level.\n\nThis one is tricky. Academic achievement can vary widely based on individual abilities, educational support, and other factors. Some individuals with moderate intellectual disability might reach an eighth-grade level in certain academic areas, but many might not achieve that level in all subjects.\n\nIt's probably not accurate to say \"usually\" up to eighth-grade level, as there's a lot of variation.\n\nTherefore, Option C seems less certain.\n\nOption D: Display minimal or no impairment in sensorimotor functioning.\n\nJust because someone has moderate intellectual disability doesn't mean they have sensory or motor impairments. These are separate aspects of development.\n\nHowever, it's possible that some individuals with moderate intellectual disability also have sensory or motor issues, especially if there's a underlying condition that affects multiple areas of development.\n\nBut generally, intellectual disability and sensorimotor impairments are distinct.\n\nSo, Option D might be somewhat correct, but it's not entirely accurate to say \"minimal or no impairment,\" because there could be impairments present.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps in some cases, sensorimotor functioning is affected, but not necessarily in all cases.\n\nGiven that, Option D might not be the best choice.\n\nConsidering all options, Option B seems the most straightforwardly correct.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nIf I look at the characteristics of individuals with moderate intellectual disability, they often require structured environments and may be able to learn vocational skills with supervision.\n\nSo, yes, training them to perform unskilled work under close supervision aligns with that description.\n\nOption A's percentage seems off based on typical prevalence rates.\n\nOption C is too definitive about academic achievement levels, which can vary.\n\nOption D assumes that sensorimotor functioning is minimally impaired, which isn't necessarily the case for all individuals with moderate intellectual disability.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is Option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
