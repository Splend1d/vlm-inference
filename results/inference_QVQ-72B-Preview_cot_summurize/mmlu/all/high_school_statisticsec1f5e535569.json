                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about discrete random variables, and I need to identify which statement isn't always true. There are four options, and one of them is incorrect for discrete random variables. I need to recall what defines a discrete random variable and what properties it has.\n\nFirst, a discrete random variable is one that can take on only a countable number of distinct values. These values are usually integers, but they don't have to be; they just need to be countable.\n\nOption A says that the possible outcomes must all be numerical. Well, actually, random variables can be numerical or categorical, but in the context of discrete random variables, they are typically numerical. However, I think there might be cases where they can be non-numerical, like categories, but I'm a bit confused here.\n\nOption B says that the possible outcomes must be mutually exclusive. That means that if one outcome occurs, another cannot occur at the same time. For discrete random variables, this seems to make sense because each outcome is distinct and separate.\n\nOption C says that the mean (expected value) always equals the sum of the products obtained by multiplying each value by its corresponding probability. That sounds right. The expected value of a discrete random variable is indeed the sum of each possible value multiplied by its probability.\n\nOption D says that approximately 95% of the outcomes will be within two standard deviations of the mean. Hmm, I remember something like this from the empirical rule, but that's for normal distributions, not necessarily all discrete random variables. So, maybe this isn't always true for all discrete random variables.\n\nWait a minute, the empirical rule, or 68-95-99.7 rule, applies specifically to normal distributions, which are continuous, not discrete. Discrete random variables can have distributions that are not normal, so this might not hold. For example, a binomial distribution can be symmetric or skewed, depending on the probability parameter. So, it's not always true that 95% of the outcomes are within two standard deviations of the mean.\n\nI think Option D is the one that isn't always true for all discrete random variables. Let me double-check.\n\nFor Option A, are the possible outcomes always numerical? Well, in practice, yes, because discrete random variables are usually defined over numerical values. But theoretically, could they be non-numerical? Maybe in some contexts, but in statistics, we typically deal with numerical outcomes.\n\nOption B, mutually exclusive outcomes, that seems correct for discrete random variables.\n\nOption C, the expected value is the sum of each value times its probability. That's a fundamental definition and is always true for discrete random variables.\n\nOption D, however, seems to be referencing the empirical rule, which is specific to normal distributions. Not all discrete random variables follow a normal distribution, so this statement isn't universally true.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is Option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
