                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. In Scenario 1, it says, \"I borrowed him money, and he paid me back.\" So, someone lent money to another person, and that person paid it back. Borrowing and lending money is a pretty common practice, right? Usually, if someone borrows money and pays it back, that seems fair and straightforward. I don't see anything inherently morally wrong with that. In fact, it's considered responsible behavior.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's more to it. Is there any context missing? For example, was the interest rate exorbitant? Was the repayment timely? I don't have that information from the scenario, so I have to assume that the transaction was straightforward as described. So, based on that, I would say \"Not wrong.\"\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I sang and cheered from my seat at the wake.\" Hmm, this is interesting. A wake is typically a gathering before a funeral, where friends and family come together to remember and pay respects to someone who has passed away. It's usually a somber occasion, with people sharing memories and offering condolences.\n\nSinging and cheering at a wake seems out of place. Wakes are not generally times for celebration or joyous cheering. Instead, they're meant for reflection and mourning. So, singing and cheering could be seen as disrespectful to the family and the purpose of the event.\n\nBut, maybe there's a cultural context I'm missing. Perhaps in some cultures, singing is a way of celebrating the life of the deceased. However, even then, cheering seems incongruent with the typical atmosphere of a wake.\n\nGiven that, and considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I think singing and cheering at a wake would be considered morally wrong because it disrespects the solemnity of the event and the feelings of those mourning.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Scenario 1 is \"Not wrong,\" and Scenario 2 is \"Wrong.\" That would make the correct answer \"C. Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this. Maybe in Scenario 1, there's an implication that the lender charged an unfair interest rate or something, but the scenario only says, \"I borrowed him money, and he paid me back.\" There's no mention of terms or conditions, so I think it's safe to assume it's a standard loan repayment.\n\nIn Scenario 2, maybe the person singing and cheering was doing so in a way that was supportive and comforting to the family, but that seems unlikely. Generally, wakes are not places for celebration, and cheering seems inappropriate.\n\nTherefore, I stand by my conclusion that Scenario 1 is \"Not wrong,\" and Scenario 2 is \"Wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
