                    "text": "So I have this question about the dichromate ion and its reaction to form Cr3+. I need to find the oxidation state of chromium in the dichromate ion and also determine whether the process is a reduction or oxidation when dichromate forms Cr3+. The options are given, so I need to pick the correct one.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the dichromate ion is. I know that it's a polyatomic ion, and its chemical formula is Cr2O7^2-. So, it's two chromium atoms bonded to seven oxygen atoms, and the whole ion has a charge of 2-.\n\nNow, I need to find the oxidation state of chromium in this ion. To do that, I should use the concept of oxidation numbers. Oxidation numbers help us keep track of the electrons in a compound or ion.\n\nI know that oxygen typically has an oxidation number of -2 in most compounds, except when it's bonded to fluorine. Since there's no fluorine here, I can assume oxygen is -2.\n\nThe dichromate ion has a charge of 2-, and it consists of two chromium atoms and seven oxygen atoms. So, the sum of the oxidation numbers of all the atoms in the ion should equal the charge of the ion.\n\nLet me denote the oxidation number of chromium as x. Then, for the dichromate ion:\n\n2x + 7(-2) = -2\n\nThat is, 2 chromium atoms contribute 2x, and 7 oxygen atoms contribute 7(-2).\n\nSo, 2x - 14 = -2\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n2x = -2 + 14\n\n2x = 12\n\nx = 6\n\nTherefore, the oxidation state of chromium in the dichromate ion is +6.\n\nNow, the question also asks whether the formation of Cr3+ from dichromate is a reduction or oxidation process.\n\nI know that reduction is a process where the oxidation state decreases, and oxidation is where it increases.\n\nCurrently, in dichromate, chromium is in the +6 state. If it forms Cr3+, which is chromium with a charge of 3+, that means its oxidation state has decreased from +6 to +3.\n\nSo, that would be a reduction process.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 3+, reduction\n\nB. 12+, reduction\n\nC. 6+, reduction\n\nD. 6+, oxidation\n\nBased on my calculations, the oxidation state in dichromate is +6, and forming Cr3+ is a reduction process.\n\nSo, the correct option should be C. 6+, reduction.\n\nBut wait, option A shows 3+, which is Cr3+, but that's the product, not the starting material.\n\nOption B has 12+, which doesn't make sense for chromium.\n\nOption D says 6+, oxidation, but as I determined, forming Cr3+ from dichromate is a reduction, not oxidation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 6+, reduction.\n\nJust to double-check, let me confirm the oxidation state of chromium in dichromate ion.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the structure of dichromate. It's known that dichromate is formed by the bonding of two chromate ions, each of which has chromium in the +6 oxidation state.\n\nSo, yes, in both chromate and dichromate, chromium has an oxidation state of +6.\n\nAnd when it forms Cr3+, which is +3, it's clearly a reduction process.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 6+, reduction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
