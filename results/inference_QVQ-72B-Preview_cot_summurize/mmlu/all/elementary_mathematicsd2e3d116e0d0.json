                    "text": "So Jean threw a softball 9 feet. That's pretty straightforward. Then Lee threw it 3 times as far as Jean. Hmm, I need to figure out what that means exactly. If Jean threw it 9 feet, then 3 times that distance would be... let's see, 9 multiplied by 3, right? So, 9 times 3 is 27 feet. So, Lee threw it 27 feet.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the equation that represents this situation, not just the answer. So, I need to find which equation can be used to determine the distance, d, that Lee threw the ball.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. dx3 = 9\n\nB. d + 3 = 9\n\nC. 3 + 9 = d\n\nD. 3 x 9 = d\n\nFirst, option A is dx3 = 9. Is this correct? Well, if dx3 equals 9, that would mean that d times 3 equals 9. But wait, in the problem, Jean threw 9 feet, and Lee threw 3 times as far as Jean. So, if Jean's throw is 9 feet, then Lee's throw should be 9 times 3, which is 27 feet. So, in equation form, that would be d = 9 x 3.\n\nBut option A says dx3 = 9, which is different. That would imply that d times 3 equals 9, which would mean d = 9/3 = 3. That doesn't make sense in this context because Lee is supposed to have thrown 3 times as far as Jean, not one-third the distance. So, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B is d + 3 = 9. This suggests that if you add 3 to d, you get 9. So, d would be 9 minus 3, which is 6. But again, that doesn't align with the problem where Lee threw 3 times as far as Jean, who threw 9 feet. So, that would make Lee's throw 27 feet, not 6 feet. Therefore, option B is also incorrect.\n\nOption C is 3 + 9 = d. Well, 3 plus 9 is indeed 12, but does that represent Lee throwing 3 times as far as Jean? No, because 3 times 9 is 27, not 12. So, this equation doesn't correctly model the situation.\n\nFinally, option D is 3 x 9 = d. So, 3 multiplied by 9 equals 27, which matches our earlier calculation of Lee throwing 27 feet. This seems to fit perfectly with the problem statement that Lee threw 3 times as far as Jean, who threw 9 feet.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe I should consider the wording of the problem again. It says, \"Lee threw a softball 3 times as far as Jean.\" So, Jean's throw is 9 feet, and Lee's is 3 times that, which is 27 feet. So, in equation form, it's d = 3 x 9.\n\nIs there any possibility of misinterpretation here? Let me think. Could \"3 times as far as Jean\" be interpreted differently? For example, could it be 9 x 3 or 3 x 9? Well, if Jean's throw is 9 feet, then 3 times that distance should indeed be 9 multiplied by 3, which is 27. So, option D correctly represents that relationship.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other context or if the equation needs to be set up differently. For example, maybe they want the equation in terms of d equals something else. But no, the problem is clear: d should represent the distance Lee threw, which is 3 times Jean's throw of 9 feet.\n\nSo, after reviewing all the options, it's clear that option D is the correct equation to determine Lee's throw distance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
