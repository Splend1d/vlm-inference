                    "text": "Okay, so I have this question here about ion sizes. It's asking which of these ions has the smallest radius: K+, Ca2+, Sc3+, or Rb+. Hmm, I need to recall some chemistry about ionic radii.\n\nFirst off, I know that ions formed from the same period or group can be compared based on their charge and their position in the periodic table. Let me see where these elements are located.\n\nK+ is potassium with atomic number 19, which is in group 1, period 4. Ca2+ is calcium with atomic number 20, group 2, period 4. Sc3+ is scandium with atomic number 21, group 3, period 4. Rb+ is rubidium with atomic number 37, group 1, period 5.\n\nSo, K+, Ca2+, and Sc3+ are all in period 4, while Rb+ is in period 5. Generally, as you move down a group, atomic radii increase because of the addition of electron shells. So, Rb+ being in period 5 should have a larger radius than K+ in period 4.\n\nBut wait, it's ions we're comparing here, not neutral atoms. I need to think about how ionization affects the size.\n\nWhen an atom loses electrons to form a cation, its size decreases because the effective nuclear charge increases relative to the number of electrons. So, for example, K+ has the same electron configuration as Ca, which is [Ar]4s\u00b23d\u2070.\n\nWait, no. Let me double-check that. The electron configuration of potassium is [Ar]4s\u00b9, and when it loses that one electron to become K+, it should have the same configuration as argon, [Ar]. Calcium is [Ar]4s\u00b2, so Ca2+ would have [Ar] configuration as well. Scandium is [Ar]3d\u00b94s\u00b2, so Sc3+ would be [Ar]3d\u00b9, since it loses the 4s electrons and one 3d electron.\n\nRubidium is [Kr]5s\u00b9, so Rb+ would be [Kr], which is larger than the others since it's in period 5.\n\nSo, among K+, Ca2+, and Sc3+, which are all based on the [Ar] core, but with different charges, how do their sizes compare?\n\nI recall that as the charge on the ion increases, the radius decreases because the nuclear charge pulls the electrons in tighter. So, Sc3+ has a higher positive charge than Ca2+, which has a higher charge than K+. Therefore, Sc3+ should be smaller than Ca2+, which is smaller than K+.\n\nBut wait, let's think about it more carefully. The number of protons is increasing from K to Ca to Sc, but so is the number of electrons being removed to form the ions. K+ has 18 electrons, Ca2+ has 18 electrons, Sc3+ has 18 electrons as well, all with the same electron configuration as argon. So, the nuclear charge is increasing from K+ (19 protons) to Ca2+ (20 protons) to Sc3+ (21 protons), and with each additional proton, the nuclear charge increases, pulling the electrons in closer, resulting in a smaller radius.\n\nTherefore, Sc3+ should have the smallest radius among these three.\n\nNow, comparing to Rb+, which has [Kr] configuration, which is a larger electron shell than [Ar], so it should have a larger radius than any of the period 4 ions.\n\nWait, but Rb+ is in period 5, and its electron configuration is [Kr], which is larger than [Ar]. So, even though it's a 1+ ion, its size should be larger than the period 4 ions.\n\nSo, the order should be Sc3+ < Ca2+ < K+ < Rb+ in terms of radius.\n\nTherefore, the smallest radius among the given options is Sc3+.\n\nBut let me check some periodic tables or charts to confirm this.\n\nI found that in general, for isoelectronic ions, the radius decreases with increasing nuclear charge. So, since K+, Ca2+, and Sc3+ are all isoelectronic with 18 electrons, but their nuclear charges are 19, 20, and 21 respectively, their radii should decrease in that order.\n\nRb+, being in the next period with a larger electron shell but only one positive charge, should indeed have a larger radius than the period 4 ions.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that Sc3+ has the smallest radius among the given options.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the actual numerical values of their radii to be sure.\n\nI recall that the ionic radius for K+ is around 1.33 \u00c5, Ca2+ is around 1.00 \u00c5, Sc3+ is around 0.75 \u00c5, and Rb+ is around 1.48 \u00c5.\n\nSo, according to these values, Sc3+ does indeed have the smallest radius among the four.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Sc3+.\n\nBut just to make sure, is there any other factor that could affect this?\n\nFor example, the electronic shell structure or the specific orbital being filled.\n\nNo, I think I've covered the main points here.\n\nSo, the final answer is C. Sc3+.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
