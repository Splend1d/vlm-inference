                    "text": "Let's see here. The question is asking why a population is considered the evolutionary unit. The options are:\n\nA. Genetic changes can only occur at the population level.\n\nB. The gene pool in a population remains fixed over time.\n\nC. Natural selection affects individuals, not populations.\n\nD. Individuals cannot evolve, but populations can.\n\nHmm, let's think about this one by one.\n\nOption A says that genetic changes can only occur at the population level. Well, genetic changes like mutations happen in individual organisms, right? But maybe those changes are only relevant to evolution when they're passed on to future generations and affect the population's gene pool. So, perhaps it's more accurate to say that while mutations occur in individuals, they influence the population's genetics.\n\nOption B claims that the gene pool in a population remains fixed over time. But I thought that one of the key concepts in evolution is that gene pools can change over time due to various factors like mutation, selection, migration, and genetic drift. So, this seems contradictory to what I know about evolution.\n\nOption C states that natural selection affects individuals, not populations. I remember that natural selection acts on individual organisms based on their traits, and those traits are determined by their genes. So, while selection happens to individuals, it's the population's gene pool that changes over time as a result. Maybe this is hinting at something, but it doesn't directly explain why the population is the evolutionary unit.\n\nOption D says that individuals cannot evolve, but populations can. This seems intriguing. I've heard that evolution is about changes in populations over time, not about individual organisms evolving during their lifetimes. For example, an individual giraffe doesn't grow longer necks because it stretches to reach leaves; instead, over many generations, giraffes with longer necks survive better and pass on their genes, leading to a population with longer necks over time.\n\nThinking back to what I learned in biology class, evolution is defined as changes in the frequency of alleles in a population from one generation to the next. So, it's all about populations and their genetic composition changing over time. Individuals don't pass on acquired characteristics; they just have traits that are determined by their genes, which can be selected for or against in the environment.\n\nTherefore, individual organisms don't evolve in the sense that their genetic makeup changes and is passed on to the next generation. Instead, it's the population as a whole that evolves through the accumulation of genetic changes over generations.\n\nSo, among the given options, D seems to be the most accurate explanation: individuals cannot evolve, but populations can.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any way that individuals can be considered evolutionary units?\n\nWell, natural selection acts on individuals based on their phenotypes, which are expressions of their genotypes. But the actual evolution\u2014the change in genetic composition\u2014is at the population level. So, while individuals are the ones being selected, it's the population's gene pool that's changing over time.\n\nMoreover, concepts like group selection suggest that sometimes selection can act on groups of individuals, but even in those cases, it's still about changes in the frequencies of genes across those groups.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that evolution is a population phenomenon because it's about the transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next, and that transmission happens at the level of the population.\n\nSo, yeah, I think D is the best answer here. It directly addresses the core concept of evolution as a process that occurs at the population level, not at the individual level.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if any of the other options could also be correct in some way.\n\nOption A: Genetic changes can only occur at the population level. While it's true that genetic changes like mutations become part of the population's gene pool and can spread through the population, the actual mutations occur in individual organisms. So, this option seems a bit misleading because it's individuals that mutate, and those mutations then affect the population.\n\nOption B: The gene pool in a population remains fixed over time. This is contrary to the fundamental idea of evolution, which is that gene pools do change over time due to various evolutionary forces.\n\nOption C: Natural selection affects individuals, not populations. This is somewhat true in that selection acts on individual organisms based on their traits, but again, it's the population's genetic composition that changes as a result of differential reproduction of those individuals. So, while selection affects individuals, its impact is felt at the population level.\n\nTherefore, none of these other options directly explain why the population is the evolutionary unit as effectively as option D does.\n\nIn conclusion, the best explanation is option D: individuals cannot evolve, but populations can. This captures the essence of evolution as a process that operates on populations through changes in their genetic composition over time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
