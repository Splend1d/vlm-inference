                    "text": "So I've got this contract law problem here, and I need to figure out if the woman can successfully sue the owner of the lumber yard for breaching their contract with the builder. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a woman who hired a builder to build a house for $250,000, and the construction was supposed to be completed within four months. Then, two weeks after this building contract was formed, the builder contacted a lumber yard and made a written agreement to buy lumber for $10,000, payable within 30 days. But then, a fire destroyed a lot of the lumber yard's supply, and they refused to supply the lumber to the builder. Because of this, the builder couldn't find another lumber supplier and told the woman he couldn't finish her house on time.\n\nNow, the woman wants to sue the owner of the lumber yard for breach of contract. The question is, will she prevail?\n\nLet me consider the relationships between these parties. There are two main contracts here:\n\n1. The contract between the woman and the builder: the builder agrees to build a house for $250,000 within four months.\n\n2. The contract between the builder and the lumber yard: the lumber yard agrees to supply lumber for $10,000 within 30 days.\n\nThe lumber yard didn't supply the lumber because of the fire, which means they breached their contract with the builder. Now, the builder can't complete the house on time, which affects the woman.\n\nBut the woman isn't directly party to the contract between the builder and the lumber yard. So, can she sue the lumber yard for breaching that contract?\n\nIn contract law, generally, only parties to a contract can sue for breach of that contract. This is called \"privity of contract.\" So, in this case, the builder is the one who has privity with the lumber yard, not the woman.\n\nBut there are exceptions to this rule. One exception is when there's an \"equitable assignment\" of the builder's claim against the lumber yard to the woman.\n\nOption A says that by operation of law, the woman is an equitable assignee of the builder's claim against the lumber yard. So, if this is the case, she could sue the lumber yard for breaching the contract with the builder.\n\nBut I need to understand what makes someone an equitable assignee. Equitable assignment is when rights under a contract are assigned to another party, often in cases where the original party isn't able to enforce them adequately. But in this scenario, it's not clear why the builder's claim would be equitably assigned to the woman.\n\nOption B says yes, but only if the builder's contract with the lumber yard wasn't discharged by the fire. So, this brings up the issue of whether the fire discharged the lumber yard's obligation to supply the lumber.\n\nDischarge by destruction of the subject matter can happen if the subject matter is totally destroyed and is essential to the performance of the contract. Here, the fire destroyed a good portion of the lumber yard's supply, but not necessarily all of it. Does this mean the contract is discharged? Maybe not entirely, but perhaps partially.\n\nBut the question is about whether the contract was discharged, meaning completely excused from performance. If the fire destroyed only a portion of the lumber, maybe the lumber yard could still supply some lumber, or perhaps they could get it from another source. So, it's not necessarily that the contract was discharged; the lumber yard just refused to supply the lumber.\n\nOption C says no, because privity of contract doesn't exist between the woman and the lumber yard. As I thought earlier, privity of contract is generally required for one party to sue another for breach of contract. So, since the woman isn't a party to the contract between the builder and the lumber yard, she can't sue the lumber yard for breaching that contract.\n\nBut wait, there might be exceptions where a third party can sue for breach of contract if they were an intended beneficiary of the contract.\n\nOption D says no, because the woman is only an incidental beneficiary of the contract between the builder and the lumber yard.\n\nSo, in contract law, there are different types of beneficiaries:\n\n1. Intended beneficiaries: These are third parties for whose benefit the contract was made, and they can sue for breach of contract.\n\n2. Incidental beneficiaries: These are third parties who might benefit from the contract but weren't the intended beneficiaries. They generally cannot sue for breach of contract.\n\nIn this case, the contract is between the builder and the lumber yard for the supply of lumber. The woman is not a party to this contract. Was she an intended beneficiary?\n\nThe builder needed the lumber to build the house for the woman. So, arguably, the woman might be an intended beneficiary of the contract between the builder and the lumber yard, because the builder needed the lumber to fulfill their obligation to the woman.\n\nBut, in practice, courts often look at the intent of the parties when they made the contract. Did the builder and the lumber yard intend to benefit the woman with this contract? It's not entirely clear from the information given.\n\nMoreover, typically, it's the builder who would sue the lumber yard for not supplying the lumber, not the woman directly.\n\nBut perhaps in some jurisdictions, if the woman is an intended beneficiary, she might have standing to sue.\n\nHowever, the question seems to suggest that the woman is trying to step into the shoes of the builder to enforce the contract against the lumber yard, perhaps through some assignment or other legal mechanism.\n\nOption A mentions an equitable assignment by operation of law. Maybe in some circumstances, if the builder has assigned their rights against the lumber yard to the woman, she could sue the lumber yard.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that there was any such assignment. It's just saying that by operation of law, she is an equitable assignee.\n\nI'm a bit unsure about this. Maybe there's some doctrine that allows the woman to sue the lumber yard directly under certain conditions.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose the builder assigns their claim against the lumber yard to the woman. If that assignment happens, then the woman could sue the lumber yard for breaching the contract with the builder.\n\nBut again, the problem doesn't mention any such assignment. It just says that by operation of law, she is an equitable assignee.\n\nPerhaps there's some legal principle that operates to assign the builder's claim to the woman in this situation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the woman can sue the lumber yard for interfering with her contract with the builder, but that's a different cause of action, not directly a breach of contract claim.\n\nWait, maybe there's a concept of third-party beneficiary in contract law, where a third party who isn't a signatory to the contract can enforce it if the contract was intended to benefit them.\n\nBut again, typically, the third party would need to be an intended beneficiary, not just an incidental beneficiary.\n\nOption D says the woman is only an incidental beneficiary, which suggests she can't sue.\n\nBut option C says no because of lack of privity, which is a stronger statement.\n\nI think the key here is whether the woman can step into the builder's shoes to enforce the contract against the lumber yard.\n\nOption A suggests that by operation of law, she is an equitable assignee, which might allow her to do that.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the basis for that assertion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's some agency relationship or other legal doctrine that allows her to enforce the contract.\n\nWait, maybe the builder had some kind of pass-through arrangement where the lumber was being purchased specifically for the woman's project, and she was paying for it directly or something like that.\n\nBut the problem doesn't indicate that. It seems like the builder was contracting independently with the lumber yard.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the woman can sue the lumber yard for tortious interference with her contract with the builder, but that's not a breach of contract claim; it's a tort claim.\n\nBut the question specifies a breach of contract claim.\n\nSo, perhaps the woman is trying to sue the lumber yard for breaching the contract between the builder and the lumber yard, claiming that she is an assignee of that contract.\n\nBut without an explicit assignment, I don't think that's possible.\n\nUnless there's some legal doctrine that operates to assign the builder's rights to the woman under certain circumstances.\n\nOption A seems to suggest that by operation of law, she is an equitable assignee, which might be possible in some jurisdictions if the builder's rights are being assigned to her for some reason, perhaps to secure her position or to ensure she can recover damages for the builder's breach.\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted.\n\nOption B says yes, but only if the builder's contract with the lumber yard wasn't discharged by the fire.\n\nThis brings up the issue of whether the fire discharged the lumber yard's obligation to supply the lumber.\n\nAs I thought earlier, if the fire destroyed only a portion of the lumber yard's supply, it might not necessarily discharge the entire contract. The lumber yard might still be obligated to supply what lumber they have left or to find another source.\n\nSo, unless the fire completely destroyed their ability to supply any lumber, the contract probably isn't discharged.\n\nBut the problem states that the fire destroyed a \"good portion\" of the lumber yard's supply, and they refused to supply lumber to the builder.\n\nIt doesn't specify if the entire supply was destroyed or just a significant part.\n\nIf only a portion was destroyed, perhaps the lumber yard still has some lumber to supply, but they chose not to.\n\nIn that case, their refusal to supply the lumber would be a breach of contract, unless they can show that the fire excused their performance.\n\nBut generally, if the fire only partially destroys the subject matter, it doesn't discharge the contract entirely.\n\nSo, if the lumber yard still has some lumber, they should supply what they can.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that the contract wasn't discharged by the fire, and the lumber yard is still liable for breaching the contract by refusing to supply the lumber.\n\nBut again, the woman isn't a party to that contract, so she can't directly sue the lumber yard for breaching it, unless there's some exception that applies.\n\nOption C says no because of lack of privity, which seems straightforward.\n\nOption D says no because she's only an incidental beneficiary.\n\nBetween C and D, C is more direct, stating that there's no privity between the woman and the lumber yard.\n\nD suggests that she's only an incidental beneficiary, which would mean she can't sue for breach of contract.\n\nBut perhaps there's an argument that she's an intended beneficiary.\n\nI need to think about whether the woman was an intended beneficiary of the contract between the builder and the lumber yard.\n\nThe builder needed the lumber to build the house for the woman. So, the woman might be seen as an intended beneficiary.\n\nBut in contract law, for a third party to be an intended beneficiary, the contract must be made for their benefit, and it must be clear that the parties intended to benefit that third party.\n\nIn this case, it's not explicitly stated that the builder and the lumber yard intended to benefit the woman.\n\nMore likely, the builder was acting in their own interest in purchasing the lumber to fulfill their obligation to the woman.\n\nSo, the woman would be an incidental beneficiary, not an intended one.\n\nTherefore, under option D, she couldn't sue the lumber yard for breaching the contract with the builder.\n\nOption A seems speculative, as it suggests that by operation of law, she is an equitable assignee, but without more information, it's hard to see the basis for that.\n\nOption B is conditional, saying yes but only if the builder's contract with the lumber yard wasn't discharged by the fire.\n\nAs I thought earlier, unless the fire completely destroyed the lumber yard's ability to supply any lumber, the contract probably wasn't discharged.\n\nSo, assuming the contract wasn't discharged, would the woman be able to sue the lumber yard?\n\nProbably not, because of the lack of privity.\n\nUnless there's some legal mechanism that allows her to step into the builder's shoes, which option A suggests, but again, without an explicit assignment, it's unclear.\n\nI think the most straightforward answer is option C: no, because privity of contract doesn't exist between the woman and the lumber yard.\n\nThe woman isn't a party to the contract between the builder and the lumber yard, so she can't sue for breach of that contract.\n\nUnless there's some exception that applies, like being an intended beneficiary or an equitable assignee, which isn't clearly established here.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. No, because privity of contract does not exist between the woman and the owner of the lumber yard.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
