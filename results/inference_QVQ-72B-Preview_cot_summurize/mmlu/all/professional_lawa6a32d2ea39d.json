The tutor sent the law student a copy of the tutor's standard tutorial agreement. The agreement stated that the tutor's rate was $50 per one-hour session. The law student then telephoned the tutor and said, \"This agreement looks fine to me. I'd like you to give me 10 sessions over the next 10 days. \" The tutor replied, That will be fine. Fill in 10 sessions on the agreement, sign it, and bring it to me tomorrow when we have our first session. \" The student then said, \"I want you to really push me to do my best. In fact, if I get an A in any class I'll pay you an additional $100 for each A. \"The next day, the law student brought the signed agreement to the tutorial session. The tutor conducted all 10 sessions. Two weeks later, when the results of the finals were released, the law student excitedly called the tutor and exclaimed, \"Thank you so much I just found out that I received two A's and two B's in my classes!\" The tutor then sent the law student a bill for $700. Two days later the tutor received a check from the law student in the amount of $500. Included with the check was a note which read, \"You taught me contract law very well. I now know that I am not obligated to pay you the additional $200 for the A's, because that was just a gratuitous promise. \" On the back of the check the law student typed the following:\"Endorsement of this check by payee constitutes surrender of all claims against me arising out of our tutorial arrangement. \"In need of money, the tutor endorsed and cashed the check. What is the probable legal effect of the tutor's endorsement of the check?\n\nA. It constituted a discharge of a liquidated claim.\nB. It constituted an accord and satisfaction of an unliquidated claim.\nC. Part payment of a liquidated claim would not constitute a discharge of the entire amount due.\nD.

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving a law student and a tutor, and there's some back and forth about payment for tutoring sessions and some extra incentive for good grades. Let me try to wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst, the tutor sends over a standard tutorial agreement that says the rate is $50 per one-hour session. The law student agrees to 10 sessions over 10 days and mentions that if they get an A in any class, they'll pay an extra $100 per A. So, initially, the tutor agrees to 10 sessions at $50 each, totaling $500, and there's this additional promise of $100 per A.\n\nAfter the tutoring sessions, the student gets their grades: two A's and two B's. So, according to their earlier promise, they should pay an extra $200 for the two A's, making the total payment $700 ($500 for the sessions plus $200 for the A's). But instead, the student sends a check for $500 with a note saying that the extra promise was gratuitous and not enforceable. Then, on the back of the check, there's a clause that says endorsing the check constitutes surrender of all claims arising from the tutorial arrangement.\n\nThe tutor, needing money, endorses and cashes the check. Now, the question is, what's the legal effect of this endorsement?\n\nLet's break this down. There are a few concepts here that I need to understand:\n\n1. **Liquidated vs. Unliquidated Claims**: A liquidated claim is one where the amount is certain or can be readily determined. An unliquidated claim is one where the amount isn't fixed or is in dispute.\n\n2. **Accord and Satisfaction**: This is a concept where a debtor offers a lesser amount, and the creditor accepts it in full satisfaction of the debt, resolving the claim.\n\n3. **Consideration**: For a contract to be enforceable, there must be consideration, which is something of value exchanged between parties.\n\nIn this case, the tutor initially expected $500 for the tutoring sessions, plus an additional $200 for the A's, totaling $700. The student only pays $500, claiming the extra promise was gratuitous and not enforceable.\n\nNow, the tutor endorses the check, which includes a clause that says endorsement constitutes surrender of all claims arising from the tutorial arrangement.\n\nSo, does this mean that by endorsing the check, the tutor is agreeing to accept $500 in full settlement of any claims related to the tutoring?\n\nLet me think about whether this is a liquidated or unliquidated claim.\n\nThe $500 for the tutoring sessions is liquidated because it's a fixed amount agreed upon in the contract. However, the additional $200 for the A's might be unliquidated if there was no clear agreement on whether that promise was enforceable or not.\n\nThe student claims that the promise to pay extra for A's was gratuitous and not enforceable. If that's the case, then the only enforceable claim is the $500 for the tutoring sessions.\n\nBut the tutor sent a bill for $700, implying they believed the extra $200 was due. The student paid only $500 and included a note explaining why they didn't pay the extra $200.\n\nNow, the check has a clause saying that endorsing it constitutes surrender of all claims arising from the tutorial arrangement. So, by endorsing the check, is the tutor agreeing to give up any right to the extra $200?\n\nI need to consider if this clause is enforceable.\n\nFirst, was there a valid agreement for the extra $200? The student initially promised to pay $100 per A, but later claimed it was gratuitous. If it was a binding contractual promise, then the tutor has a right to the $200. If it was merely a gratuitous promise, then the tutor doesn't have a right to it.\n\nBut, in contract law, promises can be enforceable if there's consideration. Did the tutor promise anything in return for the student's promise of extra payment for A's?\n\nLooking back, the student said, \"I want you to really push me to do my best. In fact, if I get an A in any class I'll pay you an additional $100 for each A.\" The tutor replied, \"That will be fine. Fill in 10 sessions on the agreement, sign it, and bring it to me tomorrow when we have our first session.\"\n\nIt seems like the tutor agreed to provide 10 sessions, and the student promised to pay $500 plus $100 per A. So, there might be an argument that the tutor agreed to put in extra effort to help the student get A's in exchange for the extra payment. That could be seen as consideration.\n\nBut the student later claims it was gratuitous, meaning no consideration was offered for the extra promise.\n\nIf the extra promise was gratuitous, then the tutor has no enforceable claim for the $200, and endorsing the check for $500 would be sufficient payment for the tutoring sessions.\n\nHowever, if the extra promise was part of the contract and had consideration, then the tutor is owed $700 in total.\n\nNow, the check is for $500 with a clause that endorsement constitutes surrender of all claims. If the tutor endorses the check, are they agreeing to give up their claim for the extra $200?\n\nIn terms of accord and satisfaction, for it to be valid, there needs to be a dispute about the amount owed (an unliquidated claim), an offer of a lesser amount, acceptance of that offer, and consideration.\n\nHere, there seems to be a dispute over whether the extra $200 is owed. The tutor billed for $700, the student paid $500, claiming the extra $200 is not owed.\n\nIf the tutor endorses the check, they are accepting $500 in full settlement of all claims. But is this enforceable?\n\nOption A says it constitutes a discharge of a liquidated claim. A liquidated claim is one where the amount is certain. The $500 for the tutoring sessions is liquidated, but accepting less than a liquidated claim doesn't necessarily discharge the entire claim unless there's an agreement to that effect.\n\nOption B says it constitutes an accord and satisfaction of an unliquidated claim. An unliquidated claim is one where the amount is in dispute. Here, the $200 is in dispute because the student claims it's not enforceable.\n\nOption C says part payment of a liquidated claim would not constitute a discharge of the entire amount due. So, if the $700 is the liquidated claim, paying $500 wouldn't discharge the entire amount unless there's an agreement to that effect.\n\nOption D says part payment of an unliquidated claim does not constitute sufficient consideration for the discharge of the entire claim.\n\nHmm.\n\nI think the key here is whether the $200 is part of the liquidated claim or not.\n\nIf the $200 is part of the liquidated claim (i.e., it's a fixed amount due), then paying $500 wouldn't discharge the entire claim unless there's an agreement to that effect, which is the clause on the check.\n\nIf the $200 is an unliquidated claim (i.e., in dispute), then accepting $500 with the clause might constitute accord and satisfaction.\n\nBut, in this case, the $500 is the amount agreed upon for the tutoring sessions, which is liquidated. The $200 is in dispute, so it's unliquidated.\n\nSo, by endorsing the check, which includes the clause surrendering all claims, the tutor is agreeing to accept $500 in full settlement of all claims, both liquidated and unliquidated.\n\nBut does this clause make the acceptance of $500 in full satisfaction of the entire claim, including the disputed $200?\n\nI think that's what the clause is intended to do.\n\nSo, if the tutor endorses the check, they are agreeing to the terms on the back, which say that endorsement constitutes surrender of all claims arising from the tutorial arrangement.\n\nTherefore, by endorsing the check, the tutor is effectively agreeing to accept $500 in full settlement of any and all claims related to the tutoring, including the disputed $200.\n\nSo, in legal terms, this would be an accord and satisfaction of the unliquidated claim for the $200.\n\nWait, but the $500 is the liquidated claim for the tutoring sessions. The $200 is the unliquidated claim for the extra payment for A's.\n\nSo, by endorsing the check, the tutor is accepting $500 in full settlement of both the liquidated and unliquidated claims.\n\nBut, generally, part payment of a liquidated claim doesn't discharge the entire claim unless there's an agreement to that effect.\n\nHere, the clause on the check provides that endorsement constitutes surrender of all claims, which is effectively an agreement to discharge the entire claim.\n\nSo, even though the $200 is in dispute (unliquidated), the tutor is agreeing to accept $500 in full settlement of all claims by endorsing the check.\n\nTherefore, this would be considered an accord and satisfaction of the unliquidated claim.\n\nSo, the probable legal effect is that it constitutes an accord and satisfaction of an unliquidated claim.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
