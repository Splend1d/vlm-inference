                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about John Finnis rejecting Hume's conception of practical reason. I'm not super familiar with either philosopher's work, but I'll try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst off, John Finnis is known for his natural law theory, which argues that there are objective moral principles derived from human nature that can guide our actions. David Hume, on the other hand, was a Scottish Enlightenment philosopher who made significant contributions to epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics, among others. His views on practical reason are particularly relevant here.\n\nThe question is asking on what grounds Finnis rejects Hume's conception of practical reason. The options are:\n\nA. That natural law corresponds to positive law.\n\nB. That Hume is a legal positivist.\n\nC. That syllogistic logic is false.\n\nD. That human reason can help us to determine what constitutes a worthwhile life.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: That natural law corresponds to positive law.\n\nNatural law is a concept that suggests there are universal moral principles that are inherent in human nature and can be discovered through reason. Positive law, on the other hand, refers to the laws made by human authorities, like governments. Saying that natural law corresponds to positive law would imply that these two are aligned or similar in some way.\n\nBut I'm not sure how this directly relates to Finnis rejecting Hume's view of practical reason. Maybe I need to think differently here.\n\nOption B: That Hume is a legal positivist.\n\nLegal positivism is the idea that the validity of a law is independent of its moral or ethical content. It essentially separates law from morality. Hume is often considered a precursor to legal positivism, but I need to confirm that.\n\nIf Hume was a legal positivist, and Finnis is a proponent of natural law, which connects law and morality, then there might be a conflict there. However, I'm not entirely sure how this relates to practical reason specifically.\n\nMoving on to option C: That syllogistic logic is false.\n\nSyllogistic logic is a form of deductive reasoning where a conclusion is drawn from two premises. For example, \"All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.\" This seems pretty straightforward and widely accepted in logic. It's hard to see why Finnis would reject Hume's view of practical reason based on a disagreement about syllogistic logic. Maybe this isn't the right path.\n\nLastly, option D: That human reason can help us to determine what constitutes a worthwhile life.\n\nThis seems more directly related to practical reason. Practical reason is about how we use our reasoning abilities to guide our actions and make decisions about what to do. If Finnis believes that reason can help us determine what makes life worthwhile, that would be in line with his natural law theory, which holds that there are objective goods that reason can discern.\n\nHume, on the other hand, is famous for his assertion that \"reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions,\" meaning that reason alone cannot motivate action; rather, it serves our passions and desires.\n\nSo, if Finnis believes that reason can help us determine what constitutes a worthwhile life, that would contrast with Hume's view that reason is subordinate to passion and cannot on its own tell us what we ought to do.\n\nGiven that, option D seems like a plausible ground for Finnis's rejection of Hume's conception of practical reason.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to interpret this.\n\nOption A seems unrelated because natural law corresponding to positive law doesn't directly address practical reason.\n\nOption B suggests that Hume is a legal positivist, which might conflict with Finnis's natural law views, but again, this doesn't seem directly connected to practical reason.\n\nOption C, rejecting syllogistic logic, doesn't seem relevant to practical reason either.\n\nTherefore, option D seems the most fitting answer. Finnis likely rejects Hume's conception of practical reason because he believes that human reason can help us determine what constitutes a worthwhile life, which contradicts Hume's emphasis on passion over reason in motivating action.\n\nI think the answer is D."
