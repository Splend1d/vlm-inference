                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a contract between a law bookstore and a publisher over some casebooks. They agreed on 100 copies at $10 each, but then the publisher realized they miscalculated and said the price should be $11 per book. They told the bookstore owner that they wouldn't deliver unless the owner agreed to pay $11 instead of $10. The owner didn't have much choice and agreed reluctantly.\n\nNow, the question is asking whether this agreement to pay $11 is enforceable or not, and there are four options:\n\nA. Enforceable, because it was not supported by any new consideration.\n\nB. Enforceable, under the principle of promissory estoppel.\n\nC. Unenforceable, because it is violative of the statute of frauds.\n\nD. Unenforceable, because the error resulted from the publisher's computational error.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the original contract. The bookstore and the publisher had a written contract for 100 casebooks at $10 each. So, the total price was $1,000. Three days after the contract was formed, but before delivery, the publisher called and said there was a miscalculation, and the price should be $11 per book, making the total $1,100. They refused to deliver unless the bookstore agreed to pay the higher price.\n\nThe bookstore owner, perhaps feeling pressured because the books hadn't been delivered yet, reluctantly agreed to pay $11 per book.\n\nNow, the question is whether this new agreement is enforceable.\n\nLet's look at option A: enforceable because it was not supported by any new consideration.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Generally, for a modification of a contract to be enforceable, there needs to be additional consideration. So, if there's no new consideration, the modification might not be enforceable. But option A says it's enforceable because there's no new consideration, which seems backwards. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nOption B: enforceable under the principle of promissory estoppel.\n\nPromissory estoppel is a doctrine that can enforce a promise even without consideration if the promisee has reasonably relied on the promise to their detriment. In this case, the publisher made a promise to sell at $10, but then wanted $11. The bookstore owner relied on the $10 price and perhaps made plans based on that. But did the publisher rely on the $11 price? I'm a bit confused here.\n\nOption C: unenforceable because it violates the statute of frauds.\n\nThe statute of frauds generally requires that certain contracts must be in writing to be enforceable. Since the original contract was written, and the modification was oral (I assume, unless stated otherwise), there might be an issue here. But I need to check if modifications need to be in writing as well.\n\nOption D: unenforceable because the error resulted from the publisher's computational error.\n\nThis seems interesting. If the error was solely due to the publisher's miscalculation, and there was no mutual mistake or fraud involved, maybe the original contract stands, and the modification isn't enforceable.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully.\n\nFirst, the original contract was for $10 per book, written agreement. Then, the publisher unilaterally decides to change the price to $11 per book, citing a miscalculation, and threatens not to deliver unless the bookstore agrees to the new price.\n\nThe bookstore, perhaps under duress because they needed the books and the publisher had them, agreed reluctantly.\n\nSo, was this agreement to pay $11 coerced under duress? If so, it might not be enforceable.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"the owner's agreement to pay $11 per book is...,\" and the options are about enforceability and specific legal principles.\n\nLet me consider the concept of duress. Duress occurs when one party is coerced into agreeing to terms due to the unlawful pressure of the other party. Here, the publisher is refusing to deliver the books unless the bookstore pays more. Is this duress?\n\nWell, generally, refusing to perform unless paid more isn't illegal pressure; it's just renegotiating terms. So, maybe not duress.\n\nWhat about mutual mistake? The publisher made a miscalculation. If both parties were mistaken about a material fact, the contract could be voidable. But in this case, only the publisher made the mistake; the bookstore was aware of the original price and agreed to it.\n\nSo, it's not a mutual mistake; it's only the publisher's mistake.\n\nIn contract law, a mistake by one party generally doesn't allow them to avoid the contract unless there are exceptional circumstances, like fraud or misrepresentation by the other party, which isn't the case here.\n\nTherefore, the publisher is bound by the original contract price of $10 per book.\n\nNow, the bookstore owner, perhaps unaware of these legal nuances, agreed to pay $11 under pressure.\n\nBut does that agreement to pay $11 have any legal standing?\n\nOption A says it's enforceable because there's no new consideration. But actually, without new consideration, the modification might not be enforceable. So, this seems contradictory.\n\nOption B mentions promissory estoppel. Is that applicable here? Promissory estoppel typically applies when one party relies on a promise to their detriment. In this case, the publisher promised to sell at $10, but then wanted more. The bookstore owner might have relied on the $10 price in some way, but it's not clear.\n\nOption C says it's unenforceable due to the statute of frauds. If the original contract was written and the modification was oral, and if the modification needs to be in writing per the statute of frauds, then perhaps it's unenforceable. But I need to check if modifications need to be in writing.\n\nOption D says it's unenforceable because the error was the publisher's computational error.\n\nI think option D is the most accurate here. The publisher's miscalculation was their own mistake, and they can't unilaterally impose a higher price based on that mistake. The original contract stands, and the modification isn't enforceable.\n\nWait, but the bookstore owner agreed to the $11 price. Does that change things?\n\nWell, the agreement to pay $11 was made after the contract was formed, and it was under pressure from the publisher threatening not to deliver. So, perhaps that agreement is not valid because it was coerced.\n\nBut in contract law, modifications need to be supported by new consideration to be enforceable. Here, there's no new consideration offered by either party for the price increase. So, the modification lacks consideration and is therefore unenforceable.\n\nSo, perhaps option A is incorrect, and the correct answer is that it's unenforceable because there's no new consideration.\n\nWait, but option A says \"enforceable because it was not supported by any new consideration.\" That doesn't make sense. If there's no new consideration, the modification shouldn't be enforceable.\n\nOption D mentions the publisher's computational error, but that's more about why the modification was proposed, not why it's enforceable or not.\n\nOption C mentions the statute of frauds. If the original contract was in writing and the modification was oral, and if the contract falls under the statute of frauds, which often includes contracts for the sale of goods over a certain amount, then the modification might not be enforceable unless it's in writing.\n\nSo, perhaps option C is also a possibility.\n\nBut I need to prioritize the reasons.\n\nFirst, the modification lacks consideration. The original contract was based on $10 per book, and the publisher can't just change that unilaterally based on their own mistake.\n\nSecond, if the contract falls under the statute of frauds, any modifications might need to be in writing, and if the modification was oral, it might not be enforceable.\n\nBut between these, I think the lack of consideration is the primary reason the modification is unenforceable.\n\nSo, I would say the correct answer is that it's unenforceable because there's no new consideration supporting the modification.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option A says \"enforceable because it was not supported by any new consideration,\" which is contradictory.\n\nOption D says \"unenforceable because the error resulted from the publisher's computational error.\"\n\nWhile the publisher's error is a factor, the primary reason the modification is unenforceable is because there's no new consideration.\n\nSo, perhaps the best answer is option D, but for a different reason.\n\nAlternatively, option C says it's unenforceable due to the statute of frauds. If the contract for 100 casebooks at $10 each totals $1,000, and if that amount falls under the statute of frauds, which in many jurisdictions requires contracts over a certain amount to be in writing, then the oral modification might not be enforceable.\n\nBut I need to consider both factors: lack of consideration and potential statute of frauds issues.\n\nI think the most straightforward reason is the lack of consideration. Modifications to contracts generally require new consideration to be enforceable. Here, there's no new consideration provided for the price increase, so the agreement to pay $11 is unenforceable.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Unenforceable, because the error resulted from the publisher's computational error.\n\nBut I should confirm if the statute of frauds applies here. If the original contract was in writing and the modification was oral, and if the contract is for goods over a certain threshold, which $1,000 likely is, then the modification might not be enforceable unless it's in writing.\n\nSo, both lack of consideration and the statute of frauds could be reasons why the modification is unenforceable.\n\nBut since the question provides specific options, and option D mentions the publisher's computational error, which is related to why the modification was proposed, but not necessarily why it's unenforceable, I think option D is not the best answer.\n\nOption C mentions the statute of frauds, which could be a valid reason if the contract falls under it.\n\nHowever, I think the primary reason is the lack of consideration.\n\nBut since that option isn't directly available, and option D mentions the publisher's error, which is related but not the direct reason for unenforceability, I'm a bit torn.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is C, unenforceable because it violates the statute of frauds, assuming that the contract for the sale of goods over a certain amount requires a written agreement, and oral modifications are not enforceable.\n\nBut I need to make sure. In many jurisdictions, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) governs the sale of goods, and it has provisions regarding modifications of contracts.\n\nUnder the UCC, a contract for the sale of goods for a price of $500 or more isn't enforceable unless there's some writing sufficient to indicate that a contract has been made between the parties. However, modifications of such contracts don't necessarily require a writing if they're made in good faith.\n\nBut in this case, the modification was proposed by the publisher after they realized their miscalculation, and the bookstore agreed under pressure. Whether this modification is enforceable would depend on various factors, including whether it was made in good faith and whether there's any writing supporting the modification.\n\nGiven that the modification was oral and likely not in writing, it might not be enforceable under the statute of frauds.\n\nTherefore, option C seems plausible.\n\nBut I need to consider all options carefully.\n\nOption A: Enforceable, because it was not supported by any new consideration.\n\nThis doesn't make sense because lack of consideration typically makes a modification unenforceable, not enforceable.\n\nOption B: Enforceable, under the principle of promissory estoppel.\n\nPromissory estoppel might apply if the bookstore owner relied on the publisher's promise to sell at $10 and suffered detriment as a result of the publisher's change in price. But it's not clear if that's the case here. The owner might have made plans based on the $10 price, but it's speculative.\n\nOption C: Unenforceable, because it is violative of the statute of frauds.\n\nThis could be a valid reason if the contract falls under the statute of frauds and the modification wasn't in writing.\n\nOption D: Unenforceable, because the error resulted from the publisher's computational error.\n\nWhile the publisher's error is what led to the modification, it's not directly why the modification is unenforceable. The error was the publisher's, and they can't impose a higher price based on their mistake.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think option C is the most accurate answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Unenforceable, because it is violative of the statute of frauds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
