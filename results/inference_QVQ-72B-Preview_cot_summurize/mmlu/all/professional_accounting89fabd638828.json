                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this scenario about a company that starts an operating lease for office space on January 1, but they don't actually move in until May 1, and payments start in July. I need to figure out when they should start recognizing rental expense for this new office.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an operating lease is. From what I remember, an operating lease is when a company uses an asset (in this case, office space) for a period without actually owning it, and makes rental payments over time. The lease payments are typically expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nNow, in this situation, the company receives control of the property on January 1, but they don't start making alterations until March 1. That means they have two months where they have control but aren't doing anything with the space yet. Then, they start making leasehold improvements from March 1 to, let's say, some point before May 1, since they move in on May 1.\n\nThe question is, when should they start recognizing rental expense? Options are January, March, May, or July.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, control of the property is received on January 1. In lease accounting, the point at which control is transferred is often when the lease expense starts to be recognized. But I need to confirm that.\n\nIf control is transferred on January 1, does that mean they have the right to use the property from that date? If so, they should start recognizing expense from January.\n\nHowever, they didn't move in until May 1. Maybe there was some reason they couldn't use the space before that, like leasehold improvements were needed.\n\nBut, they started alterations on March 1, which suggests that between January 1 and March 1, they might have had the space but weren't using it fully.\n\nWait, but they received control on January 1, so perhaps they should recognize expense from that date.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the leasehold improvements period is considered a rent-free period or something like that.\n\nI need to recall how leasehold improvements affect lease expense recognition.\n\nIn general, when a lessee takes control of the property, they should start recognizing lease expense. Any period before that might not require expense recognition.\n\nBut in this case, they took control on January 1.\n\nWait, maybe there's a concept of constructive occupancy or something similar.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nConstructive occupancy means that even if the lessee isn't physically occupying the space, if they have control over it, they should recognize lease expense.\n\nSo, if they have control from January 1, they should start recognizing expense from that date.\n\nBut, perhaps there's a different perspective.\n\nMaybe the period from January 1 to May 1 is a rent-free period, and rent only starts being payable from July 1.\n\nBut, in lease accounting, even if there's a rent-free period, the lessee still has to recognize lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWait, but in operating leases, sometimes companies recognize rent expense only when they start paying rent.\n\nBut I think, according to more recent accounting standards, even in operating leases, lease expense should be recognized from the date control is transferred.\n\nLet me check some resources.\n\nAccording to ASC 842, which is the current lease accounting standard for US GAAP, lessees should recognize lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for all leases except short-term leases. For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nSo, in this case, since it's an operating lease, and control was transferred on January 1, lease expense should start being recognized from January 1.\n\nBut, the company starts paying rent only from July 1.\n\nSo, from January 1 to June 30, they would have accrued lease expense but not yet paid it.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the lease agreement specifies that rent starts from the date of occupancy or from the date of substantial completion of improvements.\n\nBut, based on the information given, it says they receive control on January 1 and start alterations on March 1, move in on May 1, and start paying rent on July 1.\n\nSo, control is received on January 1, which might be the lease commencement date.\n\nTherefore, lease expense should be recognized from January 1.\n\nBut, to confirm, let's think about it differently.\n\nSuppose the lease agreement starts on January 1, and they have the right to occupy and use the property from that date, even if they choose not to occupy it immediately.\n\nIn that case, they should still recognize lease expense from January 1.\n\nThe fact that they didn't start alterations until March 1 and moved in on May 1 doesn't change the fact that they had control from January 1.\n\nMoreover, the rent payments starting in July might be part of a rent concession, where initial periods are rent-free.\n\nIn such cases, under ASC 842, rent concessions should be allocated over the entire lease term.\n\nTherefore, the total rent payable over the lease term should be spread evenly over the lease term, including any rent-free periods.\n\nSo, even if they are not paying rent from January to June, they should still recognize lease expense over those months, based on the straight-line method.\n\nHence, the recognition of rental expense should begin in January.\n\nWait, but let's consider another angle.\n\nSuppose that during the period from January 1 to May 1, they were making leasehold improvements.\n\nIn some lease agreements, the period during which improvements are being made might not require lease expense recognition until the improvements are completed and the asset is ready for use.\n\nBut, generally, under ASC 842, lease expense should be recognized from the commencement date, which is typically when control is transferred.\n\nTherefore, unless there's a specific clause in the lease agreement that defers the recognition of lease expense during the improvement period, they should recognize lease expense from January 1.\n\nGiven that, the answer should be January.\n\nBut let's see what the other options suggest.\n\nOption B is March, which is when they started alterations.\n\nMaybe someone could argue that until alterations start, they aren't fully utilizing the space, so lease expense shouldn't be recognized.\n\nBut that doesn't align with the control transfer concept.\n\nOption C is May, when they moved in.\n\nAgain, that's when they started occupying the space, but they had control from January 1.\n\nOption D is July, when payments start.\n\nThis is typical in some accounting practices where expense is recognized when cash is paid, but that's not in line with accrual basis accounting.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be January.\n\nTo summarize, since control of the property was transferred on January 1, the company should begin recognizing rental expense from that month, regardless of when they started alterations, moved in, or began making payments.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A.
