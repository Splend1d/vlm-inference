The question is: Hume says that beauty is...\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. a quality in things themselves\n\nB. a matter of a priori knowledge\n\nC. judged by logical standards\n\nD. no quality in things themselves\n\nHmm, I need to recall what Hume thought about beauty.\n\nI remember that David Hume was a Scottish philosopher, and he had some ideas about aesthetics and beauty.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall Hume's view on beauty. I think he argued that beauty isn't something that exists in the object itself, but rather it's a perception or a feeling in the observer.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then option A says \"a quality in things themselves.\" That seems to contradict what I think Hume believed. He probably didn't think that beauty is an inherent quality of the object.\n\nOption B says \"a matter of a priori knowledge.\" A priori knowledge is knowledge that's independent of experience, like mathematical truths or logical deductions. I don't recall Hume classifying beauty as a priori. His philosophy was more empirical, relying on experience and observation, so maybe not.\n\nOption C says \"judged by logical standards.\" While logic can be applied to many areas, I don't think Hume considered beauty to be something that's determined logically. Beauty seems more subjective and emotional, doesn't it?\n\nOption D says \"no quality in things themselves.\" This seems to align with what I remember about Hume's view. He thought that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, meaning it's subjective and not an intrinsic property of the object.\n\nLet me double-check this. I think Hume wrote about this in his essay \"Of the Standard of Taste.\" In that essay, he discusses how beauty is not a property of the object but is instead derived from the observer's feelings and sentiments.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then beauty is not a quality in things themselves, which would make option A incorrect and option D correct.\n\nBut wait, option D says \"no quality in things themselves,\" which is a bit vague. It might be better to say that beauty is not an inherent quality but a perception or a response.\n\nHowever, based on the options given, D seems the most fitting.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other perspective I might be missing. Maybe Hume did think that beauty was a quality in things themselves, and I have misremembered.\n\nNo, I don't think so. I'm pretty sure Hume argued against the idea that beauty is an objective quality.\n\nHe thought that taste and beauty were subjective and varied from person to person, but there were certain principles that could guide judgments of taste.\n\nSo, perhaps none of the options perfectly capture Hume's view, but among them, D is the closest.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that Hume believed that beauty is a perception, not a quality of the object itself.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then saying \"no quality in things themselves\" aligns with his view.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he would say that beauty is a quality, but it's a perceived quality, not an inherent one.\n\nBut the way option D is phrased, \"no quality in things themselves,\" suggests that it's not a quality residing in the object.\n\nWhich aligns with Hume's emphasis on beauty being in the observer's mind.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct choice.\n\nJust to make sure, let's look back at the options:\n\nA. a quality in things themselves \u2013 contradicts Hume's view.\n\nB. a matter of a priori knowledge \u2013 Hume was an empiricist, so he valued experience over a priori knowledge.\n\nC. judged by logical standards \u2013 beauty is more about emotion and perception than logic.\n\nD. no quality in things themselves \u2013 aligns with Hume's view that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
