Over the course of time, the land-development company developed two residential subdivisions of the land, an eastern subdivision and a western subdivision, each of which contained 150 acres. These subdivisions were created by separate plats that made no reference to each other. The restrictions in the plats were, however, substantially identical. The plats and each deed provided that \"the use of the land herein conveyed is restricted to single-family dwellings only, and this covenant is intended to apply to each and every lot in the subdivision and runs with the land, binding every lot owner, his heirs, and assigns. \"After all but four lots in each subdivision had been sold by the land-development company, it sold 50 acres of the remaining 100 acres of land to a country club by a deed containing the following provisions:\"This deed is executed and accepted with the understanding that the property above described is hereby restricted so that(1) said property may be used as a country club, with a golf course, pool, tennis courts, club house, eating facilities, and other improvements appropriate to a country club. (2) said property may also be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern subdivision and the property shall thereafter be used in accordance with and conveyed subject to residential restrictions that shall conform with those restrictions in force against the eastern subdivision. (3) the restrictions herein contained shall be deemed covenants running with the land, and for breach of any covenant herein, the land development company, its successors, and assigns may, at its option, re-enter and terminate the estate conveyed hereby. \"At the time of this conveyance, the land- development company retained title to the remaining 50 acres in the original 400-acre tract. Within a few months of the execution of this deed, the country club had built a club house, golf course, and tennis courts on a portion of its land, and it had 25 acres of vacant land upon which it wished to build a complex containing a hotel and shopping mall surrounded by high-rise buildings and luxury apartments. With respect to the 50-acre tract that the country club purchased from the land-development company, which of the following most accurately describes the deed restrictions (1) and (2)?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this land development scenario, and I need to figure out what kind of deed restrictions are in place for the 50-acre tract that the country club bought from the land-development company. The restrictions are listed as (1) the property can be used as a country club with various amenities, and (2) the property can also be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern subdivision, with residential restrictions that conform to those in the eastern subdivision.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these restrictions means. Restriction (1) allows the use of the property as a country club with specific facilities like a golf course, pool, tennis courts, club house, eating facilities, and other improvements appropriate for a country club. Restriction (2) allows the property to be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision, similar to the eastern subdivision, and subject to the same kind of residential restrictions that are in place for the eastern subdivision.\n\nNow, I need to categorize these restrictions as one of the following: affirmative covenant(s), equitable easement(s), express easement(s) appurtenant, or equitable servitude(s).\n\nLet me recall what each of these terms means:\n\n1. **Affirmative covenant**: This is a promise by the grantee to do something on the property, often requiring some action or maintenance. It typically benefits the grantor or another specified party.\n\n2. **Equitable easement**: This is a right to use another's property for a specific purpose, enforceable through equity. It's similar to an easement but may not be strictly defined by traditional easement requirements.\n\n3. **Express easement appurtenant**: This is a non-possessory interest in another's land that benefits a particular piece of land (the dominant tenement) and burdens another piece of land (the servient tenement). It's created by express agreement and is appurtenant to the land.\n\n4. **Equitable servitude**: This is a restriction on the use of land that is enforceable through equity. It's often used to enforce restrictions in plats or covenants running with the land.\n\nGiven that the restrictions in question are part of the deed and relate to the use of the land, I need to see which of these categories fits best.\n\nFirst, looking at restriction (1): the property can be used as a country club with specific amenities. This seems more like a permission or an affirmative use rather than a restriction. However, in real estate law, sometimes \"restrictions\" can include both prohibitions and permissions.\n\nRestriction (2): the property can be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision, subject to residential restrictions that conform to those in the eastern subdivision. This suggests that if the country club chooses to subdivide the land for residential use, it must adhere to the same restrictions that apply to the eastern subdivision.\n\nNow, considering these, let's see which option fits:\n\nA. Affirmative covenant(s): These are typically promises to do something, often involving active use or maintenance of the property. Restriction (1) allows the use as a country club, which might be seen as an affirmative use, but it's more of a permission than a covenant.\n\nB. Equitable easement(s): Easements are generally rights to use another's property. In this case, the restrictions seem to pertain to the use of the country club's own property, not to use someone else's property.\n\nC. Express easement(s) appurtenant: Similar to above, this would involve rights over someone else's land, which doesn't seem to fit here since the restrictions are about the use of the country club's own land.\n\nD. Equitable servitude(s): This seems the most plausible. Equitable servitudes are often used to enforce restrictions in plats or covenants running with the land. In this scenario, the restrictions are part of the deed and are intended to run with the land, binding future owners.\n\nAdditionally, the deed states that \"the restrictions herein contained shall be deemed covenants running with the land, and for breach of any covenant herein, the land development company, its successors, and assigns may, at its option, re-enter and terminate the estate conveyed hereby.\"\n\nThis language suggests that the restrictions are intended to be enforceable against future owners and are covenants running with the land, which is a characteristic of equitable servitudes.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the deed restrictions (1) and (2) is D. Equitable servitude(s).\n\nBut let's double-check:\n\n- Affirmative covenants typically require the grantee to do something, whereas these restrictions seem more about permitted uses and conforming uses if the property is subdivided.\n\n- Easements generally involve using someone else's property, which isn't the case here.\n\n- Express easements appurtenant are specifically about rights that benefit one piece of land and burden another, which doesn't fit this scenario.\n\n- Equitable servitudes are used to enforce land use restrictions and can be created by deeds or plats, running with the land and binding future owners.\n\nGiven this analysis, option D seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, but restriction (1) allows the use as a country club with specific amenities, and restriction (2) allows subdivision and residential use under certain conditions. So, these are more like permissions or conditions rather than just restrictions.\n\nIn real estate law, covenants can be either restrictive or affirmative. Restrictive covenants limit how the property can be used, while affirmative covenants require the owner to take certain actions.\n\nIn this case, restriction (1) is permissive\u2014it allows the property to be used as a country club with specified amenities. Restriction (2) allows the property to be subdivided and used for residential purposes under certain conditions.\n\nSo, are these affirmative covenants or restrictive covenants?\n\nAffirmative covenants typically require the grantee to do something, like maintain certain features or provide access. Restrictive covenants prohibit certain uses or actions.\n\nHere, restriction (1) is more of a permission to use the property in a certain way, which could be seen as an affirmative covenant because it affirms the right to use the property in that manner. However, it also implies that other uses are restricted, which could be seen as restrictive.\n\nRestriction (2) allows subdivision and residential use but ties it to existing restrictions in the eastern subdivision, which are likely restrictive covenants.\n\nGiven that the deed refers to these as \"restrictions,\" and they are intended to run with the land, it's likely that they are equitable servitudes.\n\nEquitable servitudes are often used to enforce both affirmative and restrictive covenants in real estate, especially in planned developments or subdivisions.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D. Equitable servitude(s), as they encompass both the permissions and restrictions imposed by the deed.\n\nI think that's the correct interpretation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
