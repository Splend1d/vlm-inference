Most of the coastline is privately owned by persons who have permanent or vacation residences on their coastal lands. A man purchased a two-acre tract of littoral (i. e. , coastal) land in the state. When the man bought the property, there was a narrow concrete walkway (about 20 feet in length and 5 feet in width) adjoining the land. The walkway, which was designed to provide pedestrian access to the beach, was owned by the State Coastal Commission. When the man moved into his beach house, he noticed that the walkway was rarely used. As a result, the man decided to enclose the walkway and construct a paddle ball court over the entire area. He did so without notifying the State Coastal Commission. He has continued to use this area in excess of the period required for adverse possession. In an appropriate action brought by the man to establish title to the walkway area, which of the following must he establish if he is to prevail?\n\nA. Real property interests can be abandoned by a governmental entity without an official vote.\nB. Lack of use of the walkway by the state created an irrevocable license in him.\nC.

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario about a man who bought some coastal land and then built a paddle ball court over a public walkway without telling the State Coastal Commission. Now, he's trying to claim ownership of that walkway area through adverse possession. There's an action in court, and I need to figure out what he has to establish to win the case. The options are A, B, C, or D.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what adverse possession is. Adverse possession is a legal concept where someone who doesn't own a property can acquire legal ownership by occupying it continuously and openly for a certain period, usually specified by state law. So, in this case, the man has been using the walkway area for longer than the required period for adverse possession.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Real property interests can be abandoned by a governmental entity without an official vote.\n\nI need to think about whether a government entity like the State Coastal Commission can abandon its property interests without going through some formal process. Generally, governments have stricter procedures for abandoning property because it's public property. So, maybe just not using the walkway isn't enough to abandon it legally. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here since the man is claiming adverse possession, not that the state abandoned the property.\n\nB. Lack of use of the walkway by the state created an irrevocable license in him.\n\nAn irrevocable license is different from adverse possession. A license is a permission to use someone else's property, but it doesn't transfer ownership. It's revocable unless there are circumstances that make it irrevocable, like a promissory estoppel. I don't think this fits the situation because the man is trying to claim ownership, not just the right to use the property.\n\nC. Real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession.\n\nThis seems relevant. Generally, governments can be subject to adverse possession claims under certain circumstances, especially if they don't use or maintain their property. So, if the State Coastal Commission didn't use or control the walkway, and the man openly used it for the required period, he might be able to claim ownership through adverse possession.\n\nD. Due to a defect in the chain of title, the state does not own this piece of land.\n\nThis suggests that there might be an issue with how the state acquired the walkway or if they have clear title to it. If there's a defect in the title, maybe the state never properly owned it in the first place. But that seems like a separate issue from adverse possession.\n\nGiven these options, I think the most straightforward answer is C: real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession. Because the man is claiming adverse possession, and he's dealing with a state-owned property, it's important to know whether states can lose their property through adverse possession.\n\nLet me double-check. Adverse possession is a doctrine that applies to all real property, regardless of whether it's owned by private individuals or by the government. However, there might be exceptions or special rules for government-owned property, especially if it's for public use, like a walkway designed for pedestrian access to the beach.\n\nIn this case, the walkway was designed for public access to the beach, which is a public use. If the state isn't maintaining or using it for its intended purpose, and someone else is occupying and using it openly and exclusively for the required period, it's possible that adverse possession could apply.\n\nOption A talks about abandonment by the government without an official vote. While abandonment might be a related concept, adverse possession doesn't require the original owner to have abandoned the property intentionally. It's more about the possessor's actions and the duration of possession.\n\nOption B mentions an irrevocable license. That seems more like a permission to use the property, not ownership. The man is trying to claim ownership, so this doesn't seem to align with his goal.\n\nOption D suggests that there's a defect in the chain of title, meaning the state might not own the land. That could be a separate defense in the action, but it doesn't directly relate to the man's claim of adverse possession.\n\nTherefore, the key point here is whether the state can lose its property through adverse possession, which is option C. If real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession, then the man's claim has a basis in law.\n\nI should also consider that since the walkway was designed for public use, there might be special rules preventing its loss through adverse possession. However, generally, even public lands can be subject to adverse possession under certain circumstances, especially if they're not being used for their intended public purpose.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the man must establish that real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession to prevail in his action to claim title to the walkway area.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
