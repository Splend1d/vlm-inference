                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about neutralizing a weak acid with KOH, and I need to find the molar mass of the acid. Let's see, it's a monoprotic weak acid, which means it has one ionizable hydrogen per molecule. The reaction should be something like HA + KOH \u2192 K\u0410 + H\u2082O, right?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I have 0.682 grams of the acid, and it takes 26.3 milliliters of 0.122 molar KOH to neutralize it completely. I need to find the molar mass of the acid, and there are four options provided.\n\nOkay, so maybe I should start by calculating the moles of KOH used in the neutralization. I know the volume and the molarity of the KOH solution. The molarity is moles per liter, so moles of KOH is molarity times volume in liters.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nMoles of KOH = (0.122 mol/L) \u00d7 (0.0263 L) = ?\n\nWait, 26.3 milliliters is 0.0263 liters.\n\nSo, moles of KOH = 0.122 \u00d7 0.0263 = let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, 0.122 \u00d7 0.02 is 0.00244, and 0.122 \u00d7 0.0063 is, hmm, 0.0007686.\n\nSo total moles of KOH = 0.00244 + 0.0007686 = 0.0032086 moles.\n\nAlright, so approximately 0.0032086 moles of KOH were used.\n\nNow, since the acid is monoprotic, it should react with KOH in a 1:1 ratio. So, moles of acid should be equal to moles of KOH used, which is approximately 0.0032086 moles.\n\nNow, I have 0.682 grams of the acid, which corresponds to 0.0032086 moles. To find the molar mass, I can divide the mass by the number of moles.\n\nMolar mass = mass / moles = 0.682 g / 0.0032086 mol.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 0.682 \u00f7 0.0032086.\n\nWell, dividing by a small number will give a larger result. Let's see, 0.682 \u00f7 0.0032086.\n\nI can multiply numerator and denominator by 10,000 to make it easier.\n\nSo, (0.682 \u00d7 10,000) \u00f7 (0.0032086 \u00d7 10,000) = 6820 \u00f7 32.086.\n\nThat should be easier to calculate.\n\nNow, 6820 \u00f7 32.086.\n\nLet me see, 32 \u00d7 200 = 6400.\n\nSubtract: 6820 - 6400 = 420.\n\nNow, 32 \u00d7 13 = 416.\n\nSubtract: 420 - 416 = 4.\n\nSo, 200 + 13 = 213.\n\nThen, 32 \u00d7 0.125 = 4.\n\nSo, 213 + 0.125 = 213.125.\n\nTherefore, the molar mass is approximately 213.125 g/mol.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 212 g mol\u207b\u00b9\n\nB. 4.70 g mol\u207b\u00b9\n\nC. 147 g mol\u207b\u00b9\n\nD. 682 g mol\u207b\u00b9\n\nSo, 213.125 is closest to option A, 212 g mol\u207b\u00b9.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check my calculations again to make sure.\n\nFirst, moles of KOH: 0.122 M \u00d7 0.0263 L = 0.0032086 moles.\n\nThen, moles of acid = moles of KOH = 0.0032086 moles.\n\nMass of acid = 0.682 g.\n\nMolar mass = 0.682 g / 0.0032086 mol = 212.5 g/mol.\n\nHmm, that's even closer to option A, 212 g mol\u207b\u00b9.\n\nMaybe I rounded up a bit in my calculation, but it's still very close to 212.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider significant figures. The given data has 0.682 g (three sig figs) and 0.122 M (three sig figs), and 26.3 mL (three sig figs). So, the answer should have three significant figures.\n\n212.5 rounds to 212 g mol\u207b\u00b9, which is option A.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 212 g mol\u207b\u00b9.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 212 \\ \\text{g mol}^{-1}} \\]"
