                    "text": "So I have this problem here about estimating the proportion of students who favor showing movies biweekly instead of monthly. The student organization wants a 90% confidence interval with a width of at most 0.08. I need to figure out how many students to sample to meet that requirement. The options are 27, 64, 106, or 423.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how to calculate the confidence interval for a proportion. I know that for large samples, the sampling distribution of the proportion \\( \\hat{p} \\) is approximately normal, and the margin of error for a confidence interval can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Margin of Error} = z^* \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( z^* \\) is the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to the desired confidence level, \\( \\hat{p} \\) is the sample proportion, and \\( n \\) is the sample size.\n\nThe width of the confidence interval is twice the margin of error, so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Width} = 2 \\times z^* \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}}\n\\]\n\nWe want this width to be at most 0.08, so:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times z^* \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}} \\leq 0.08\n\\]\n\nI need to solve this inequality for \\( n \\), but first, I need to find the value of \\( z^* \\) for a 90% confidence level. For 90% confidence, the critical value \\( z^* \\) is approximately 1.645.\n\nSo plugging in \\( z^* = 1.645 \\):\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 1.645 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}} \\leq 0.08\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n3.29 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}} \\leq 0.08\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}} \\leq \\frac{0.08}{3.29}\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n} \\leq \\left( \\frac{0.08}{3.29} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nn \\geq \\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p}) \\times \\left( \\frac{3.29}{0.08} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nBut here's the problem: I don't know \\( \\hat{p} \\). Since we haven't conducted any survey yet, we don't have an estimate for \\( \\hat{p} \\). In such cases, to be conservative, we assume the worst-case scenario where the variance is maximized. The maximum variance for \\( \\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p}) \\) occurs when \\( \\hat{p} = 0.5 \\), so \\( \\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p}) = 0.25 \\).\n\nPlugging in \\( \\hat{p} = 0.5 \\):\n\n\\[\nn \\geq 0.25 \\times \\left( \\frac{3.29}{0.08} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( \\frac{3.29}{0.08} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3.29}{0.08} = 41.125\n\\]\n\nThen square it:\n\n\\[\n(41.125)^2 = 1700.8140625\n\\]\n\nNow multiply by 0.25:\n\n\\[\n0.25 \\times 1700.8140625 = 425.203515625\n\\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) has to be an integer, and it's the minimum sample size required, we round up to the next whole number:\n\n\\[\nn = 426\n\\]\n\nLooking back at the options, the closest one is 423. But I got 426. Maybe I did something wrong in my calculations.\n\nLet me double-check my steps.\n\nFirst, the critical value for 90% confidence is 1.645. That seems correct.\n\nThe margin of error formula is correct:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Margin of Error} = 1.645 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}}\n\\]\n\nWidth is twice that, so:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 1.645 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}} \\leq 0.08\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n3.29 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}} \\leq 0.08\n\\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}} \\leq \\frac{0.08}{3.29}\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n} \\leq \\left( \\frac{0.08}{3.29} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nAssuming \\( \\hat{p} = 0.5 \\) for maximum variance:\n\n\\[\nn \\geq 0.25 \\times \\left( \\frac{3.29}{0.08} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( \\frac{3.29}{0.08} = 41.125 \\)\n\nThen \\( (41.125)^2 = 1700.8140625 \\)\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nn \\geq 0.25 \\times 1700.8140625 = 425.203515625\n\\]\n\nRounding up, \\( n = 426 \\)\n\nBut 426 isn't among the options. The closest is 423. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of \\( \\left( \\frac{3.29}{0.08} \\right)^2 \\).\n\nLet me calculate that again:\n\nFirst, \\( 3.29 \\div 0.08 = 41.125 \\)\n\nThen, \\( 41.125 \\times 41.125 \\)\n\nLet me compute that properly:\n\n\\( 41^2 = 1681 \\)\n\n\\( 41 \\times 0.125 = 5.125 \\)\n\n\\( 0.125 \\times 0.125 = 0.015625 \\)\n\nAdding them up: \\( 1681 + 5.125 + 0.015625 = 1686.140625 \\)\n\nWait, that's different from what I had before. Earlier, I had 1700.something, but now it's 1686.140625.\n\nI must have made a mistake in the earlier calculation.\n\nWait, \\( 41.125 \\times 41.125 \\):\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n\\( 41 \\times 41 = 1681 \\)\n\n\\( 41 \\times 0.125 = 5.125 \\)\n\n\\( 41 \\times 0.125 = 5.125 \\) (same as above)\n\n\\( 0.125 \\times 0.125 = 0.015625 \\)\n\nAdding them up: \\( 1681 + 5.125 = 1686.125 \\)\n\nThen plus \\( 0.015625 = 1686.140625 \\)\n\nSo, \\( (41.125)^2 = 1686.140625 \\)\n\nThen, \\( 0.25 \\times 1686.140625 = 421.53515625 \\)\n\nRounding up, \\( n = 422 \\)\n\nBut that's still not exactly matching the options. Maybe I need to use more decimal places for accuracy.\n\nLet me use more decimal places for \\( \\frac{3.29}{0.08} \\)\n\n\\( 3.29 \\div 0.08 = 41.125 \\), but more precisely, it's 41.125 exactly.\n\nThen, \\( 41.125^2 = 1686.140625 \\)\n\nTimes 0.25: \\( 1686.140625 \\times 0.25 = 421.53515625 \\)\n\nRounding up, \\( n = 422 \\)\n\nBut 422 isn't in the options. The closest is 423.\n\nMaybe the problem expects us to round differently or use an approximation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for sample size directly:\n\n\\[\nn = \\left( \\frac{z^*}{2 \\times \\text{Margin of Error}} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nGiven that the width is \\( 2 \\times \\text{Margin of Error} = 0.08 \\), so \\( \\text{Margin of Error} = 0.04 \\)\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\nn = \\left( \\frac{1.645}{2 \\times 0.04} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{1.645}{0.08} \\right)^2 = (20.5625)^2 = 422.97 \\\\\n\n\\]\n\nRounding up, \\( n = 423 \\)\n\nSo, the answer should be 423.\n\nBut to confirm, let's use the conservative estimate with \\( \\hat{p} = 0.5 \\):\n\n\\[\nn = \\left( \\frac{1.645 \\times 0.5}{0.04} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{0.8225}{0.04} \\right)^2 = (20.5625)^2 = 422.97 \\\\\n\n\\]\n\nAgain, rounding up to 423.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. 423.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
