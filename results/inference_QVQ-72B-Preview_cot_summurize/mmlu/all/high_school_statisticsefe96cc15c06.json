                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have rainfall data that's normally distributed with a mean of 6 inches and a standard deviation of 1.6 inches. We need to find the highest rainfall amount that would place this month among the 10% driest months. That means we're looking for the upper bound of the lowest 10% of rainfall amounts.\n\nFirst, since it's a normal distribution, we can use the properties of the standard normal distribution to find the corresponding z-score for the 10th percentile. The z-score tells us how many standard deviations away from the mean a value is.\n\nSo, I need to find the z-score for the 10th percentile. In standard normal distribution tables, the z-score that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.10 is approximately -1.28. Wait, but the 10th percentile is on the lower end, so the z-score should be negative, which makes sense because we're looking at values below the mean.\n\nWait, but the question is about the driest months, which means lower rainfall. So, in terms of rainfall amounts, we're looking for the upper bound of the lowest 10% of rainfall amounts. That is, we want the rainfall amount that corresponds to the 10th percentile of the distribution.\n\nGiven that, I should use the formula to find the value that corresponds to a given z-score:\n\n\\[ X = \\mu + (Z \\times \\sigma) \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( X \\) is the value we're trying to find.\n\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean (6 inches).\n\n- \\( Z \\) is the z-score corresponding to the 10th percentile.\n\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation (1.6 inches).\n\nAs I thought, for the 10th percentile, the z-score is approximately -1.28. So, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ X = 6 + (-1.28) \\times 1.6 \\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, -1.28 times 1.6:\n\n-1.28 \u00d7 1.6 = -2.048\n\nThen, 6 minus 2.048:\n\n6 - 2.048 = 3.952 inches\n\nSo, the rainfall amount that corresponds to the 10th percentile is approximately 3.952 inches. Looking back at the options, C is 3.95 inches, which matches our calculation.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check the z-score for the 10th percentile to make sure I have the correct value.\n\nIn a standard normal distribution, the z-score for the 10th percentile is indeed around -1.28. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to be more precise, I could use a z-table or a statistical calculator to get a more accurate z-score. But for now, 3.95 inches seems to be the answer.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any other way to approach this problem. Maybe using the empirical rule, which states that for a normal distribution:\n\n- About 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean.\n\n- About 95% falls within two standard deviations.\n\n- About 99.7% falls within three standard deviations.\n\nBut since we're dealing with the 10th percentile, which is more specific, using the z-score is more precise.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the inverse normal function on a calculator to find the exact z-score for the 10th percentile and then plug in the values.\n\nLet me try that. Using a calculator or statistical software, the inverse normal (0.10) gives a z-score of approximately -1.28155. Using this more precise value:\n\n\\[ X = 6 + (-1.28155) \\times 1.6 \\]\n\n\\[ X = 6 - 2.05048 \\]\n\n\\[ X = 3.94952 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, that's 3.95 inches, which matches option C.\n\nTherefore, the highest amount of rainfall for the month to be among the 10% driest months is 3.95 inches.\n\nWait a minute, let's make sure I understand what \"the 10% driest months\" means. It means that 10% of the months have rainfall less than or equal to this amount. So, indeed, it's the 10th percentile, which we've calculated as approximately 3.95 inches.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation. Maybe the problem is asking for the upper limit of the driest 10%, but in terms of rainfall, lower amounts are drier, so the lowest 10% corresponds to the lowest rainfall amounts.\n\nTherefore, the answer should indeed be around 3.95 inches.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 8.05\n\nB. 7.6\n\nC. 3.95\n\nD. 3.37\n\nOption C is 3.95 inches, which matches our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider using a different z-score, say -1.282, the calculation would be:\n\n\\[ X = 6 + (-1.282) \\times 1.6 \\]\n\n\\[ X = 6 - 2.0512 \\]\n\n\\[ X = 3.9488 \\]\n\nStill, rounding to 3.95 inches.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the z-score of -1.28, as I did initially, and consider that 3.952 rounds to 3.95 inches, it's still the same.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that 3.95 inches is the correct answer.\n\nJust to cross-verify, let's consider if the other options could make sense.\n\nOption A is 8.05 inches, which is above the mean of 6 inches. That would correspond to higher rainfall, which is not what we're looking for since we're seeking the driest months.\n\nOption B is 7.6 inches, which is also above the mean.\n\nOption D is 3.37 inches, which is lower than 3.95 inches. But according to our calculations, 3.95 inches corresponds to the 10th percentile, so 3.37 inches would correspond to a lower percentile, say the 5th or something like that.\n\nBut to confirm, let's see what z-score corresponds to 3.37 inches.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{3.37 - 6}{1.6} \\]\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{-2.63}{1.6} \\]\n\n\\[ Z \\approx -1.64375 \\]\n\nLooking up this z-score in a standard normal table, it corresponds to a cumulative probability of approximately 0.05, or 5th percentile.\n\nTherefore, 3.37 inches corresponds to the 5th percentile, which is even drier than the 10th percentile.\n\nThus, to be among the 10% driest months, the rainfall should be less than or equal to 3.95 inches, which is the 10th percentile.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 3.95 inches, option C.\n\nTo summarize, by using the z-score corresponding to the 10th percentile and plugging it into the formula for normal distribution, we determined that the highest rainfall amount for a month to be among the 10% driest is 3.95 inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3.95} \\]"
