                    "text": "After retiring from a long career in education, a teacher decided to leave the city and move to a community in the mountains. She began looking for a home to purchase in the mountain community. She found one suitable location offered for sale by the owner. The asking price for the home was $100,000. Although the teacher was very interested in purchasing the home, she told the owner that she was not sure it would fit within her budget. The owner the grabbed a piece of paper and wrote the following:\"December 1In consideration of one dollar, receipt of which is acknowledged, I hereby offer to sell to you my home for $100,000. This offer shall remain open until 4:00 p. m. December 30. \" The owner then signed the paper and handed it to the teacher, who left without paying the $1. On December 15, the owner sent the teacher a letter in which the owner stated, \"Please be advised that I am hereby withdrawing my offer to sell you my home. \" This letter was received and read by the teacher on December 16. The next day, the teacher tendered a cashier's check to the owner in the amount of $100,001 (which included the $100,000 purchase price plus the $1 consideration) and demanded a deed of conveyance to the property. The owner refused to accept the cashier's check. The teacher has now brought suit against the owner for specific performance. In her pleadings, the teacher admits that the recited $1 was not in fact paid to the owner when their written agreement was executed. Assume the teacher lives in a jurisdiction that follows the Restatement of Contracts. As a result, which of the following is the teacher's best argument that such failure of payment does not bar her claim to specific performance?\n\nA. The recited consideration was only a sham pretense of bargained-for consideration, and was therefore de minimis and of no legal significance.\nB. The teacher's inclusion of the $1 in her tendered check on December 17 was a timely cure of an immaterial breach of a bilateral real estate option contract.\nC. By promising to hold the offer open until December 30 in a signed writing, the owner could not revoke the offer prior to December 30.\nD. The written instrument embodied a proposal for a fair exchange within a reasonable time period and was therefore an enforceable option contract, regardless of whether the nominal consideration recited was bargained for or paid.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a teacher who's trying to buy a house in a mountain community. The owner of the house wrote her an offer to sell the house for $100,000, and said that this offer would stay open until December 30th. The owner wrote something like, \"In consideration of one dollar, receipt of which is acknowledged, I hereby offer to sell to you my home for $100,000. This offer shall remain open until 4:00 p.m. December 30.\" But the teacher left without paying that one dollar.\n\nThen, on December 15th, the owner sent a letter saying they're withdrawing the offer. The teacher received this letter on December 16th. The next day, she tried to give the owner a cashier's check for $100,001, which includes the $100,000 for the house plus the one dollar consideration, and demanded the deed. But the owner refused the check. Now, the teacher is suing for specific performance, meaning she wants the owner to sell her the house as promised.\n\nThe question is asking what the teacher's best argument is, considering that she didn't actually pay the one dollar when they signed the agreement, but according to the Restatement of Contracts, which her jurisdiction follows.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what's going on here. There's an offer to sell a house for $100,000, with a one-dollar consideration to keep the offer open until December 30th. But the teacher didn't pay that one dollar when she got the offer. Then, the owner tried to revoke the offer on December 15th, and the teacher tried to accept it on December 17th by paying the one dollar plus the $100,000.\n\nNow, the teacher is claiming that even though she didn't pay the one dollar initially, she should still be able to enforce the contract because of some reason related to the Restatement of Contracts.\n\nI need to look at each option and see which one makes the most sense in this situation.\n\nOption A says that the recited consideration was only a sham pretense of bargained-for consideration, and was therefore de minimis and of no legal significance.\n\nHmm, so this is suggesting that the one-dollar consideration was just a formality, not really a serious part of the bargain, and therefore not important legally. But I'm not sure if that helps the teacher. If the consideration was sham or pretense, maybe it wasn't real consideration at all, which could be a problem for the enforceability of the contract.\n\nOption B says that the teacher's inclusion of the $1 in her tendered check on December 17th was a timely cure of an immaterial breach of a bilateral real estate option contract.\n\nOkay, so this is getting into the nature of the agreement. A bilateral option contract is when both parties have obligations\u2014here, the owner is offering to sell the house and not revoke the offer until December 30th, and the teacher is supposed to pay the one-dollar consideration to keep that offer open.\n\nIf the teacher didn't pay the one dollar initially, that might be a breach of the contract. But the teacher paid it later when she tried to accept the offer. So, this option is suggesting that paying the one dollar later was a cure of that breach, and since it was an immaterial breach, it's okay.\n\nBut I need to understand what an immaterial breach is. Generally, if a breach is minor and doesn't go to the heart of the contract, the other party might still be bound to perform. But in this case, the one-dollar consideration seems pretty important because it's what's keeping the offer open.\n\nOption C says that by promising to hold the offer open until December 30th in a signed writing, the owner could not revoke the offer prior to December 30th.\n\nThis seems relevant. In contract law, an offer can generally be revoked at any time before acceptance, unless there's an agreement not to revoke it. Here, the owner has agreed not to revoke the offer until December 30th, in writing. So, even if the teacher didn't pay the one dollar, the offer is still open until December 30th, and she tried to accept it on December 17th, which is within that period.\n\nBut wait, the owner revoked the offer on December 15th, before December 30th. So, if the offer was irrevocable until December 30th, the revocation on December 15th shouldn't be effective. That means the teacher could still accept the offer on December 17th.\n\nBut the issue is that she didn't pay the one dollar initially, which was part of the agreement to keep the offer open.\n\nOption D says that the written instrument embodied a proposal for a fair exchange within a reasonable time period and was therefore an enforceable option contract, regardless of whether the nominal consideration recited was bargained for or paid.\n\nThis seems similar to Option C but goes a step further. It says that even if the one-dollar consideration wasn't bargained for or paid, the written agreement is still an enforceable option contract because it proposes a fair exchange within a reasonable time.\n\nNow, I need to think about which of these arguments is the strongest for the teacher.\n\nFirst, Option A suggests that the one-dollar consideration was just a sham and not really necessary. But if it was part of the written agreement, and the teacher didn't pay it, that might still be a breach of the contract. It's not clear if that would help her case.\n\nOption B says that paying the one dollar later was a cure of an immaterial breach. But is the breach immaterial? The one-dollar consideration seems pretty crucial to the option agreement. If it's a required part of the agreement and she didn't pay it, that might be a material breach, not immaterial.\n\nOption C points out that the offer was irrevocable until December 30th because it was in writing and signed by the owner. So, the owner couldn't revoke the offer before that date. Therefore, the teacher's acceptance on December 17th should be valid, despite the owner's attempt to revoke on December 15th.\n\nOption D says that the written agreement is an enforceable option contract regardless of whether the one-dollar consideration was bargained for or paid, as long as it proposes a fair exchange within a reasonable time.\n\nGiven that, I think Option C is a strong argument because it directly addresses the irrevocability of the offer due to the written agreement. The teacher accepted the offer within the specified period, even if she didn't pay the one dollar initially.\n\nBut then, there's the issue of the one-dollar consideration. If that was a required part of the agreement and she didn't pay it, does that affect the enforceability of the option?\n\nWait, on December 17th, she tendered a cashier's check for $100,001, which includes the one dollar consideration. So, she's trying to pay the full amount plus the consideration at the time of acceptance.\n\nMaybe the argument is that by paying the one dollar at the time of acceptance, she's fulfilling her obligation under the option agreement.\n\nBut was the one-dollar consideration supposed to be paid when the agreement was signed, or when she accepted the offer?\n\nLooking back at the offer, it says, \"In consideration of one dollar, receipt of which is acknowledged, I hereby offer to sell to you my home for $100,000. This offer shall remain open until 4:00 p.m. December 30.\"\n\nIt seems like the one-dollar consideration was supposed to be paid when the offer was made, and its receipt was acknowledged at that time. But the teacher left without paying it.\n\nSo, if the consideration was supposed to be paid upfront to keep the offer open, and she didn't pay it, that might be a breach of the agreement.\n\nHowever, the offer was still irrevocable until December 30th because it was in writing and signed by the owner.\n\nSo, even if she didn't pay the one dollar, the offer couldn't be revoked until December 30th.\n\nTherefore, her acceptance on December 17th should be valid.\n\nBut then, when she tendered the check on December 17th, she included the one dollar, which she hadn't paid before.\n\nIs this a cure of the breach?\n\nWell, if the one-dollar consideration was part of the option agreement to keep the offer open, and she didn't pay it when the offer was made, that might be a breach, but since the offer was irrevocable anyway, her acceptance is still valid.\n\nSo, perhaps the best argument is that the offer was irrevocable until December 30th because it was in writing and signed by the owner, and her acceptance on December 17th was within that period.\n\nTherefore, Option C seems to be the strongest argument.\n\nOption D is similar but more general, saying that the written instrument is an enforceable option contract regardless of the consideration.\n\nBut in this case, the consideration was specified, so Option C directly addresses the irrevocability of the offer.\n\nI think Option C is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
