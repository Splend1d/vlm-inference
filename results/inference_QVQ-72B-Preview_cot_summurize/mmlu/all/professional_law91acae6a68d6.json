                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a plat restriction in a residential subdivision. The restriction says that \"no structure shall be built except for dwelling purposes.\" Initially, a dwelling was built on one of the lots, but now the owner wants to use it as a dental office. The other owners in the subdivision are trying to stop this by asking the court to prohibit this use. I need to figure out whether the court is likely to grant their request, ignoring any zoning issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a plat restriction is. A plat restriction, also known as a restrictive covenant, is a legal agreement that limits how a piece of property can be used. These restrictions are typically imposed by the developer or the original owner of the land and are binding on future owners.\n\nIn this case, the restriction says that \"no structure shall be built except for dwelling purposes.\" So, it seems pretty clear that only structures intended for living in are allowed to be built on the lots in this subdivision.\n\nNow, the issue is that someone built a dwelling, which is allowed, but now wants to use that dwelling as a dental office. The other owners are objecting to this change in use and are seeking an injunction to prevent it.\n\nI need to determine whether the court is likely to grant their request based on the wording of the restriction.\n\nOption A says that the wording is ambiguous and therefore any use is now permitted. But I don't think that's the case. The restriction seems pretty straightforward: only dwelling structures can be built. A dental office is not a dwelling, so it shouldn't be allowed, right?\n\nOption B says that the wording only restricts the building of the structure and doesn't restrict its later use, meaning the owner can change the use to a dental office. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky. If the restriction only applies to the construction phase, then maybe the owner can build a dwelling and then use it however they want, as long as it's not for non-dwelling purposes during construction.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right either. The restriction is about the purpose of the structure, which implies that the structure should be used for dwelling purposes, not just built for that purpose.\n\nOption C says that the intention was to enforce residential use of the property, so changing it to a dental office shouldn't be allowed. This seems to align with the spirit of the restriction. If the restriction is to maintain the area as residential, then using a dwelling as a dental office would go against that intention.\n\nOption D says that a professional use of a building cannot be prohibited by a land restriction. But that contradicts what I know about restrictive covenants. These covenants are specifically designed to restrict certain uses to maintain the character of the neighborhood.\n\nI think the key here is understanding whether the restriction applies only to the construction of structures or also to their subsequent use.\n\nLet me read the restriction again: \"no structure shall be built except for dwelling purposes.\"\n\nThe verb \"built\" suggests that the restriction is primarily about the act of constructing a building, specifically that only dwelling structures can be constructed. However, once a dwelling is built, does that mean it can be used for any purpose, or is the restriction intended to ensure that the property remains used for dwelling purposes?\n\nI think the restriction is meant to ensure that only dwelling structures are constructed and that they are used for dwelling purposes. So, even after a dwelling is built, its use is still restricted to dwelling purposes.\n\nTherefore, using the dwelling as a dental office would violate the restriction because a dental office is not a dwelling.\n\nSo, the court is likely to grant the request to prohibit the intended use as a dental office because it goes against the restriction that structures are only to be used for dwelling purposes.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the correct answer: The intention was to enforce a residential use of the property so that the intended change in use will not be allowed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the wording isn't ambiguous; it's pretty clear that only dwelling structures can be built and used for dwelling purposes.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the restriction likely extends to the use of the structure, not just its construction.\n\nOption D is incorrect because restrictive covenants can indeed prohibit certain uses, including professional uses, to maintain the residential character of a neighborhood.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
