                    "text": "So I have this problem here that asks me to identify which set of integers is ordered from least to greatest. The options are:\n\nA. \u22129, \u22126, \u22123, 7, 11\n\nB. \u22123, \u22126, 7, 11, \u22129\n\nC. 11, \u22129, 7, \u22126, \u22123\n\nD. 7, 11, \u22126, \u22123, \u22129\n\nI need to find the one where the numbers are arranged in ascending order, meaning each number is larger than the one before it.\n\nFirst, I should recall what \"least to greatest\" means. It means starting from the smallest number and moving up to the largest number. So, negative numbers are smaller than positive numbers, and among negative numbers, the one with the larger absolute value is actually smaller. For example, -9 is smaller than -6 because 9 is larger than 6 in absolute terms, but since both are negative, -9 is to the left on the number line.\n\nLet me look at option A: \u22129, \u22126, \u22123, 7, 11.\n\nStarting from -9, which is the smallest, then -6, then -3, then 7, and finally 11. This seems to be in ascending order because each number is larger than the previous one.\n\nOption B: \u22123, \u22126, 7, 11, \u22129.\n\nHere, starting with -3, then -6, then 7, 11, and back to -9. Wait, that doesn't make sense. -3 to -6 is decreasing, then to 7 and 11, which are larger, and then back down to -9. So, this isn't in ascending order.\n\nOption C: 11, \u22129, 7, \u22126, \u22123.\n\nStarting with 11, which is positive, then to -9, then 7, then -6, then -3. This is not in ascending order because jumping from 11 to -9 is not an increase; it's a decrease.\n\nOption D: 7, 11, \u22126, \u22123, \u22129.\n\nStarting with 7, then 11, then to -6, -3, and -9. Again, this isn't in ascending order because after 11, it drops down to -6.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems to be the correct one.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. In option A, the sequence is \u22129, \u22126, \u22123, 7, 11.\n\n-9 is smaller than -6, which is smaller than -3, then -3 is smaller than 7, and 7 is smaller than 11. So, yes, each number is larger than the one before it.\n\nIn option B, the sequence is \u22123, \u22126, 7, 11, \u22129.\n\n-3 to -6 is decreasing, then to 7 and 11, which are larger, and then back down to -9. So, not in ascending order.\n\nOption C: 11, \u22129, 7, \u22126, \u22123.\n\nStarting with 11, which is larger than -9, so not in ascending order.\n\nOption D: 7, 11, \u22126, \u22123, \u22129.\n\nAgain, after 11, it drops to -6, which is not larger than 11.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A: \u22129, \u22126, \u22123, 7, 11.\n\nWait a minute, but I think there might be a trick here. Is there any possibility that the order could be interpreted differently? For example, could there be a set where the numbers are in ascending order but have some repetition or special arrangement?\n\nNo, I don't think so. The question is straightforward: which set is ordered from least to greatest.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the sequence of numbers without any specific order except for their arrangement from smallest to largest.\n\nAlso, I should remember that in mathematical terms, \"least to greatest\" refers to ascending order, where each subsequent number is greater than the previous one.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the correct answer is option A: \u22129, \u22126, \u22123, 7, 11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
