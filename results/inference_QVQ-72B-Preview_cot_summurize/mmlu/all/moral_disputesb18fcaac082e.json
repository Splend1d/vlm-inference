                    "text": " I'm trying to understand this question about Ross's view on conflicting duties. The options are:\n\nA. Not do anything because duties cannot actually conflict with each other.\n\nB. Use moral judgment to determine which duty should be obeyed.\n\nC. Consult authorities instead of relying on our own judgment.\n\nD. Wait until the conflict ceases on its own.\n\nI need to figure out what Ross would say about this situation. I remember that Ross was an ethical theorist who talked about prima facie duties\u2014these are duties that appear to be binding at first glance, but which might be overridden by stronger duties in certain situations.\n\nSo, if I recall correctly, Ross believed that duties can appear to conflict, but in reality, one duty might outweigh another when we consider the whole situation. So, option A says that duties cannot actually conflict, and we shouldn't do anything. But that seems a bit extreme. Ross does acknowledge that duties can seem to conflict, so maybe he doesn't completely dismiss the possibility of conflicts.\n\nOption B suggests using moral judgment to determine which duty to obey. This seems plausible because Ross emphasizes practical reasoning and the importance of considering the particular circumstances when making moral decisions. He thought that moral judgments are context-dependent and require us to balance different duties and considerations.\n\nOption C is about consulting authorities rather than relying on our own judgment. While Ross might agree that authorities can be helpful in guiding moral decisions, especially if they have expertise or wisdom, I don't think he would suggest that we should defer entirely to authorities when facing moral conflicts. His emphasis on practical reasoning suggests that individuals should engage in their own moral deliberation.\n\nOption D is to wait until the conflict ceases on its own. This seems passive and doesn't align with Ross's view that we should actively reason through moral dilemmas. He believed in taking action based on careful consideration of our duties in specific situations.\n\nSo, considering Ross's emphasis on practical reasoning and the importance of context in moral decision-making, I think option B is the most accurate. He would say that when duties appear to conflict, we should use our moral judgment to determine which duty ought to be obeyed, based on a careful assessment of the particular circumstances.\n\nTo make sure I'm not missing something, let me think about an example. Suppose I have a duty to keep a promise to a friend, but\u540c\u65f6 I have a duty to help someone in immediate danger. These duties conflict because helping the person in danger might mean breaking my promise. According to Ross, I should consider both duties, weigh them against each other in the context of the situation, and decide which one is more pressing or important in that specific scenario.\n\nThis process of weighing duties aligns with option B\u2014using moral judgment to determine which duty to obey. It doesn't align with simply doing nothing, consulting authorities without using our own judgment, or waiting for the conflict to resolve itself.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B. Use moral judgment to determine which duty should be obeyed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
