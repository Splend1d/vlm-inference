                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the \"extension pattern\" identified by Parker in 1976. It's asking which of the given options best describes this pattern. The options are:\n\nA. The lifestyle of clerical and unskilled manual workers, who see leisure time as a chance to escape from alienating work.\n\nB. Characteristic of professionals and skilled workers, whose work interests spill over into leisure time.\n\nC. A neutral balance between work and leisure, as neither connected nor oppositional, as evidenced by semi-skilled manual and clerical workers.\n\nD. The tendency of students to leave essay-writing until the last minute and then ask for an extended deadline.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what an \"extension pattern\" refers to in this context. The term \"extension\" suggests that something from work is extending into leisure time. So, it's likely about how work influences leisure activities or how people carry over their work interests into their free time.\n\nOption A talks about clerical and unskilled manual workers seeing leisure as a way to escape from alienating work. That sounds more like separating work and leisure, not extending work into leisure. So, this might be the opposite of an extension pattern.\n\nOption B says it's characteristic of professionals and skilled workers whose work interests spill over into leisure time. This seems to align with the idea of extending work interests into leisure, which could be what the extension pattern is about.\n\nOption C mentions a neutral balance between work and leisure, neither connected nor oppositional. This sounds like there's no significant spillover or conflict between work and leisure, which again might not be directly related to an extension pattern.\n\nOption D is about students procrastinating and asking for extended deadlines. That seems unrelated to the concept of extending work into leisure time, so I can probably eliminate this one.\n\nBetween options A, B, and C, option B seems to most directly relate to the idea of extending work into leisure time. Professionals and skilled workers might be more likely to pursue hobbies or interests related to their work during their free time, hence the extension pattern.\n\nOption A is more about using leisure time to escape from work, which would involve distancing oneself from work-related activities, whereas the extension pattern suggests continuing or building upon work-related interests during leisure time.\n\nOption C describes a balance where work and leisure are neither connected nor oppositional, which doesn't align with the idea of extending work into leisure.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer should be option B: characteristic of professionals and skilled workers, whose work interests spilled over into leisure time.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there's any other perspective I might be missing. Maybe the extension pattern isn't just about work interests extending into leisure time, but could also involve leisure activities influencing work. However, the way the question is phrased, it seems to focus on work extending into leisure time.\n\nAlso, considering the year 1976, which was a time when studies on work and leisure were exploring how different socioeconomic groups experienced their free time, it makes sense that professionals and skilled workers might integrate their work and leisure more seamlessly.\n\nSo, I think option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
