It's asking what they contain, and the options are:\n\nA. estrogen only\n\nB. progestin only\n\nC. synthetic androgens and estrogen\n\nD. synthetic estrogen\n\nHmm, I need to recall what mini-pills are and what they contain.\n\nI know that there are different types of birth control pills, and mini-pills are one of them. They're usually lower in hormone levels compared to other types.\n\nLet me think about the components of birth control pills.\n\nMost birth control pills contain a combination of estrogen and progestin. These are called combined oral contraceptives.\n\nBut there are also pills that contain only progestin. I think mini-pills are in this category.\n\nWait, let's make sure. Progestin is a type of progesterone, right? It's a female hormone that helps prevent pregnancy by thickening cervical mucus and possibly suppressing ovulation.\n\nEstrogen is another female hormone, and combined with progestin, it helps regulate the menstrual cycle and prevent ovulation.\n\nBut mini-pills, I recall, primarily contain progestin and have very little or no estrogen.\n\nSo, option A says estrogen only \u2013 that doesn't sound right for mini-pills. They might have some estrogen, but they're mainly progestin-based.\n\nOption B is progestin only. That seems plausible.\n\nOption C mentions synthetic androgens and estrogen. Androgens are male hormones, and while they can be found in some medications, I don't think they're components of mini-pills.\n\nOption D says synthetic estrogen. Again, mini-pills are more associated with progestin.\n\nLet me double-check this. I remember that mini-pills are also known as progestin-only pills (POP). So, that aligns with option B.\n\nI don't think they contain androgens, so option C is probably incorrect.\n\nOption A is estrogen only, which isn't accurate for mini-pills since they primarily contain progestin.\n\nOption D is synthetic estrogen, which might be present in some pills, but again, mini-pills are known for their progestin content.\n\nSo, based on my knowledge, the correct answer should be B. progestin only.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility of mini-pills containing other substances.\n\nMini-pills may sometimes contain very low doses of estrogen, but their main active ingredient is progestin.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that they contain progestin only.\n\nI think I'm confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
