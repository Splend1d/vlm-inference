                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which theorist(s) tried to explain the prices of farm products as they relate to patterns of land use?\" And the options are Rostow, Ravenstein, Von Th\u00fcnen, and Burgess. Hmm, I need to recall what each of these theorists is known for, especially in relation to land use and farm product prices.\n\nStarting with Rostow, I remember he's famous for his stages of economic growth model. He talked about how countries develop through different stages, like traditional society, takeoff, and mass consumption. But I don't recall him specifically addressing farm product prices or land use patterns. Maybe he touched on agricultural development in the context of economic growth, but it seems a bit indirect.\n\nNext is Ravenstein. I think he's known for his laws of migration. He studied how people move from one place to another and made observations about migration patterns. While migration can affect land use indirectly, I don't think he directly addressed farm product prices or land use in agriculture. So, perhaps not the best choice here.\n\nThen there's Von Th\u00fcnen. His name rings a bell in the context of land use models. I think he developed a model that explains how land is used around a central market, like a city. In his model, different types of agriculture are arranged in concentric rings based on their profitability, which is influenced by transportation costs and distance from the market. This sounds promising because it relates directly to farm product prices and land use patterns. Maybe this is the answer.\n\nLastly, Burgess. I believe he's associated with the concentric zone model of urban structure. This model describes how cities grow in rings, with different zones for things like central business districts, working-class housing, and so on. While this is about land use in urban areas, it doesn't directly address farm product prices or rural land use.\n\nSo, comparing all four, Von Th\u00fcnen seems to be the one who focused on both land use patterns and farm product prices, particularly in relation to agriculture and markets. I think the correct answer is C. Von Th\u00fcnen.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check if any of the others had some lesser-known contributions to this area. Rostow was more about economic development stages, Ravenstein about migration, and Burgess about urban structure. None of these directly tackle farm product prices in relation to land use.\n\nAlright, I'm pretty confident now. The answer is C. Von Th\u00fcnen.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
