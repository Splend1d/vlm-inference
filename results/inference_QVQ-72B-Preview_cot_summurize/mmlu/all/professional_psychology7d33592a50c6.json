                    "text": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this attachment type based on the description of this 20-month-old child and her interaction with her mother. I remember that attachment theory is about how children form bonds with their caregivers, and there are different types based on how secure or insecure that bond is. The options here are secure, insecure avoidant, insecure resistant, and insecure disorganized. Let me think about each one.\n\nFirst, secure attachment. That's when a child feels safe and comfortable with their caregiver, uses them as a secure base to explore the world, and is upset when they leave but happy when they return. From the description, the child is clinging nervously to her mother and doesn't want to explore a new play environment. That sounds like she might be anxious about being away from her mother, which could be normal in a new environment, but she's not using her mother as a secure base to explore. So, maybe not secure attachment.\n\nNext, insecure avoidant. This type is when the child seems to avoid the caregiver, doesn't seek much comfort from them, and might not show much distress when the caregiver leaves or returns. In the description, the child suddenly pushes her mother away and doesn't engage in hugs that her mother tries to give her. That sounds a bit like avoidance, but earlier she was clinging to her mother. So, it's a bit confusing. Maybe she's avoidant in some situations but not others.\n\nThen there's insecure resistant, also called ambivalent attachment. These children are very dependent on their caregivers, get upset easily when they leave, and are both seeking proximity and resisting it at the same time, like they want to be close but also feel angry or resistant. In the description, the child is clinging nervously and doesn't want to explore, which could be dependence, but then she pushes her mother away and doesn't engage in hugs. That pushing away could be resistance. Also, her facial expression shows anxiety, but she looks away from her mother, and the mother turns away too. That back-and-forth sounds a bit like resistance.\n\nLastly, insecure disorganized. This type is characterized by conflicting behaviors, like a child might freeze or show confusion in the presence of the caregiver, as if they're unsure how to behave. They might have trouble regulating their emotions and can seem disoriented. From the description, the child is clinging nervously, then pushing her mother away, not engaging in hugs, and both are looking away from each other. This seems like there's some confusion or inconsistency in their interaction, which could point towards disorganized attachment.\n\nNow, I need to decide which one fits best. Let's compare insecure resistant and insecure disorganized, since both involve some resistance and confusion.\n\nIn insecure resistant attachment, the child is seeking proximity but also resisting it, often showing anger or frustration when the caregiver tries to comfort them. In insecure disorganized attachment, the child's behavior is more unpredictable and conflicting, with signs of fear or confusion.\n\nIn the scenario, the child is clinging nervously, which could be seeking proximity, but then pushes her mother away and doesn't engage in hugs. Her facial expression shows anxiety, but she looks away, and the mother turns away too. This back-and-forth could be seen as resistant behavior, but the looking away and the mother turning away might also indicate some disorganization in their interaction.\n\nI think the key here is that the child is showing both seeking comfort and resisting it, coupled with anxiety and avoidance. This sounds a lot like insecure resistant attachment, where the child is ambivalent towards the caregiver\u2014wanting to be close but also showing resistance or anger.\n\nInsecure disorganized attachment might involve more obvious signs of confusion or fear, which aren't clearly described here, although the looking away could be a sign of discomfort or confusion.\n\nGiven that, I would lean towards insecure resistant attachment as the most likely type in this scenario.\n\nSo, the answer is C. Insecure resistant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
