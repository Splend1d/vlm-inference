                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which combination of significance level (\u03b1) and sample size (n) gives the greatest power for this hypothesis test. The null hypothesis is that the mean (\u03bc) is equal to 70, and the alternative hypothesis is that it's less than 70. And we're told that when \u03bc is actually 65, which of these options gives the highest power.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what power means in hypothesis testing. Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it's false. So, in this case, since the true mean is 65, which is less than 70, we want to make sure we reject H0 when \u03bc = 65.\n\nI know that power is related to the significance level and the sample size. Generally, increasing the sample size can increase the power of a test because with more data, we can detect smaller differences. On the other hand, decreasing the significance level makes the test more conservative, which might reduce the power.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. \u03b1 = 0.05, n = 15\n\nB. \u03b1 = 0.01, n = 15\n\nC. \u03b1 = 0.05, n = 30\n\nD. \u03b1 = 0.01, n = 30\n\nFrom options A and B, the sample size is the same (n=15), but A has a higher \u03b1 (0.05) and B has a lower \u03b1 (0.01). Since higher \u03b1 typically means a more powerful test, I would think that A has higher power than B.\n\nSimilarly, between C and D, with n=30, again, C with \u03b1=0.05 should have higher power than D with \u03b1=0.01.\n\nNow, comparing A (\u03b1=0.05, n=15) and C (\u03b1=0.05, n=30), since \u03b1 is the same, the one with the larger sample size should have higher power. So, C should have higher power than A.\n\nSame logic applies to B and D compared to A and C.\n\nWait, but D is \u03b1=0.01 and n=30, which has a lower \u03b1 than C but the same sample size as C. So, between C and D, D has a lower \u03b1, which should mean lower power.\n\nBut comparing C and A, C has the same \u03b1 but larger n, so higher power.\n\nSimilarly, D has lower \u03b1 but higher n compared to A.\n\nSo, I need to balance these two factors: \u03b1 and n.\n\nMaybe I should think about the standard error. The standard error for a sample mean is \u03c3/\u221an, where \u03c3 is the population standard deviation. If I had \u03c3, I could calculate the z-scores for the rejection regions and see which setup leads to a larger area under the curve for the power.\n\nBut I don't have \u03c3 here. Maybe I can think in terms of z-scores.\n\nLet's assume the population standard deviation is \u03c3.\n\nThe test statistic would be Z = (X\u0304 - \u03bc0)/(\u03c3/\u221an), where X\u0304 is the sample mean.\n\nUnder H0: \u03bc = 70, the null is rejected if Z < Z_\u03b1, since it's a left-tailed test.\n\nBut we know \u03bc = 65, so we want to find the probability of rejecting H0 when \u03bc = 65.\n\nThe power is P(Z < Z_\u03b1 when \u03bc = 65).\n\nLet's standardize: Z = (X\u0304 - 65)/(\u03c3/\u221an).\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about the non-centrality parameter.\n\nIn hypothesis testing, the power can be calculated using the non-centrality parameter or by finding the critical value under H0 and then calculating the probability of observing a sample mean less than that critical value when the true mean is 65.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nFirst, find the critical value for rejecting H0 at a given \u03b1.\n\nFor a left-tailed test:\n\nCritical value: X\u0304_crit = 70 - Z_\u03b1 * (\u03c3/\u221an)\n\nThen, given that \u03bc = 65, the test statistic Z = (X\u0304 - 65)/(\u03c3/\u221an)\n\nWe need P(Z < Z_\u03b1 when \u03bc = 65)\n\nBut Z_\u03b1 for \u03b1=0.05 is approximately 1.645 for a one-tailed test, and for \u03b1=0.01, it's about 2.326.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the difference in means.\n\nThe effect size is \u03bc - \u03bc0 = 65 - 70 = -5.\n\nPower is higher when the effect size is larger, but in this case, the effect size is fixed at -5, and we're varying \u03b1 and n.\n\nI think I need to consider how \u03b1 and n affect the power.\n\nGenerally, higher \u03b1 leads to higher power because the rejection region is larger.\n\nLarger n leads to higher power because the sampling distribution is tighter, making it easier to detect differences.\n\nSo, between options with the same n, higher \u03b1 gives higher power.\n\nBetween options with the same \u03b1, higher n gives higher power.\n\nTherefore, among all options, C (\u03b1=0.05, n=30) should have the highest power.\n\nBut let me check with some calculations.\n\nAssume \u03c3 is known. Let's say \u03c3 = 10 for simplicity.\n\nThen, the standard error SE = \u03c3/\u221an.\n\nFor option A: n=15, SE_A = 10/\u221a15 \u2248 2.582\n\nCritical value for \u03b1=0.05 (left-tailed): Z_0.05 \u2248 -1.645\n\nSo, X\u0304_crit = 70 - 1.645 * 2.582 \u2248 70 - 4.24 \u2248 65.76\n\nNow, under H1: \u03bc = 65\n\nZ = (X\u0304 - 65)/SE\n\nWe need P(Z < Z_\u03b1 when \u03bc = 65)\n\nBut Z_\u03b1 is the critical value, which is -1.645 in this case.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nActually, for power, we need P(reject H0 | \u03bc = 65)\n\nWhich is P(X\u0304 < X\u0304_crit | \u03bc = 65)\n\nSo, P(X\u0304 < 65.76 | \u03bc = 65)\n\nThis is P(Z < (65.76 - 65)/SE)\n\nWhere SE = 2.582\n\nSo, Z = (65.76 - 65)/2.582 \u2248 0.76/2.582 \u2248 0.294\n\nTherefore, power for option A is P(Z < 0.294) \u2248 0.615\n\nSimilarly, for option C: n=30, SE_C = 10/\u221a30 \u2248 1.826\n\nX\u0304_crit = 70 - 1.645 * 1.826 \u2248 70 - 3.00 \u2248 67.00\n\nPower = P(X\u0304 < 67 | \u03bc = 65)\n\nZ = (67 - 65)/1.826 \u2248 2/1.826 \u2248 1.095\n\nPower \u2248 P(Z < 1.095) \u2248 0.862\n\nSo, power increases from approximately 0.615 to 0.862 when n increases from 15 to 30, with \u03b1 staying at 0.05.\n\nNow, for option D: \u03b1=0.01, n=30\n\nSE_D = 1.826\n\nX\u0304_crit = 70 - 2.326 * 1.826 \u2248 70 - 4.24 \u2248 65.76\n\nPower = P(X\u0304 < 65.76 | \u03bc = 65)\n\nZ = (65.76 - 65)/1.826 \u2248 0.76/1.826 \u2248 0.416\n\nPower \u2248 P(Z < 0.416) \u2248 0.661\n\nComparing to option C's power of 0.862, it's lower.\n\nSimilarly, for option B: \u03b1=0.01, n=15\n\nSE_B = 2.582\n\nX\u0304_crit = 70 - 2.326 * 2.582 \u2248 70 - 6.00 \u2248 64.00\n\nPower = P(X\u0304 < 64 | \u03bc = 65)\n\nZ = (64 - 65)/2.582 \u2248 -1/2.582 \u2248 -0.388\n\nPower \u2248 P(Z < -0.388) \u2248 0.349\n\nWhich is even lower than option D's power.\n\nSo, indeed, option C has the highest power among all options.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider that \u03c3 might not be known, but in this case, I assumed it was 10 for calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it without assuming \u03c3, just based on general principles.\n\nIn general, for a fixed alternative value (\u03bc = 65), increasing the sample size increases the power because the standard error decreases, making the sampling distribution narrower and thus the test more sensitive to detect the difference.\n\nSimilarly, increasing \u03b1 also increases power because the rejection region becomes larger.\n\nTherefore, between options with the same n, higher \u03b1 gives higher power.\n\nBetween options with the same \u03b1, higher n gives higher power.\n\nThus, option C (\u03b1=0.05, n=30) should have the highest power.\n\nBut to confirm, let's look back at the calculations:\n\n- Option A: power \u2248 0.615\n\n- Option B: power \u2248 0.349\n\n- Option C: power \u2248 0.862\n\n- Option D: power \u2248 0.661\n\nSo, indeed, option C has the highest power.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. \u03b1 = 0.05, n = 30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
