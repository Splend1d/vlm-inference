                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here about atoms, and I need to pick which statement isn't true. There are four options:\n\nA. The nucleus contains most of the atom\u2019s mass but almost none of its volume.\n\nB. A neutral atom always has equal numbers of electrons and protons.\n\nC. A neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons.\n\nD. The electrons can only orbit at particular energy levels.\n\nOkay, let's go through these one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: The nucleus contains most of the atom\u2019s mass but almost none of its volume.\n\nI remember that in an atom, the nucleus is really small but very dense. It's like the core where all the protons and neutrons are packed together. Protons and neutrons have much more mass than electrons, so yeah, most of the atom's mass is in the nucleus. As for the volume, the nucleus is tiny compared to the overall size of the atom because the electrons are spread out in orbitals around the nucleus. So, the atom is mostly empty space, relatively speaking. So, this seems true.\n\nMoving on to option B: A neutral atom always has equal numbers of electrons and protons.\n\nThat sounds right. In a neutral atom, the number of protons in the nucleus determines the atomic number, which also determines the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus. If there are more protons than electrons, the atom would have a positive charge; if there are more electrons, it would have a negative charge. So, in a neutral atom, they should be equal. This seems true too.\n\nOption C: A neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons.\n\nHmm, I'm not so sure about this one. I know that protons and neutrons are both in the nucleus, and they have similar masses, but I don't think that the number of neutrons is always equal to the number of protons in a neutral atom.\n\nLet me think of an example. Take hydrogen, the simplest atom. It has one proton and usually, no neutrons in its nucleus. So, here, the number of neutrons is not equal to the number of protons. Another example, carbon-12 has six protons and six neutrons, which are equal, but carbon-13 has six protons and seven neutrons, which are not equal. So, it seems like in some atoms, the number of neutrons equals the number of protons, but in others, they don't. Therefore, this statement is not always true.\n\nLastly, option D: The electrons can only orbit at particular energy levels.\n\nThis is a principle from quantum mechanics, I believe. It's about how electrons exist in specific orbitals with discrete energy levels rather than continuous orbits. This is the idea that led to the development of the Bohr model of the atom, where electrons are in fixed orbits around the nucleus. So, this is indeed true.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, it seems that option C is the one that isn't always true. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check:\n\nA. The nucleus contains most of the atom\u2019s mass but almost none of its volume. - True.\n\nB. A neutral atom always has equal numbers of electrons and protons. - True.\n\nC. A neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. - Not necessarily true, as shown with hydrogen and carbon-13 examples.\n\nD. The electrons can only orbit at particular energy levels. - True.\n\nYes, I'm confident that C is the incorrect statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
