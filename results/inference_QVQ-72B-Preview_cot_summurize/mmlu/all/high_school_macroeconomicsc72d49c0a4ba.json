                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a $1000 deposit into a checking account, and as a result, excess reserves increase by $700. We need to find the reserve ratio from the given options: 70%, 30%, 40%, or 90%.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a reserve ratio is. The reserve ratio is the fraction of total deposits that a bank is required to hold as reserves. So, if the reserve ratio is 30%, for every dollar deposited, the bank must keep 0.30 dollars as reserves and can lend out the remaining 0.70 dollars.\n\nNow, excess reserves are the reserves a bank holds beyond what is required by the central bank. So, if a bank has total reserves of $1000 and the required reserves are $800, its excess reserves are $200.\n\nIn this problem, a $1000 deposit leads to an increase in excess reserves by $700. That means the bank's excess reserves go up by $700 because of this new deposit.\n\nLet's think about how a deposit affects the bank's reserves. When a deposit is made, the bank's total reserves increase by the amount of the deposit, right? So, if the bank had total reserves of, say, $2000 before the deposit, after a $1000 deposit, it would have $3000 in total reserves.\n\nBut the required reserves increase as well, because there's an increase in deposits. The required reserves are calculated as the reserve ratio times the total deposits.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- Required reserves = reserve ratio \u00d7 total deposits\n\nBefore the deposit:\n\nLet\u2019s assume the bank had some deposits, say D, and total reserves of R.\n\nSo, required reserves = r \u00d7 D, where r is the reserve ratio.\n\nExcess reserves = R - (r \u00d7 D)\n\nAfter the deposit:\n\nTotal deposits = D + 1000\n\nRequired reserves = r \u00d7 (D + 1000)\n\nTotal reserves = R + 1000\n\nExcess reserves = (R + 1000) - [r \u00d7 (D + 1000)]\n\nAccording to the problem, excess reserves increase by $700.\n\nSo:\n\n[(R + 1000) - r \u00d7 (D + 1000)] - [R - r \u00d7 D] = 700\n\nSimplify:\n\n(R + 1000 - rD - 1000r) - R + rD = 700\n\nThe R and -R cancel out, and -rD and +rD also cancel out.\n\nSo, we're left with:\n\n1000 - 1000r = 700\n\nNow, solve for r:\n\n1000 - 700 = 1000r\n\n300 = 1000r\n\nr = 300 / 1000\n\nr = 0.30, or 30%\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let's double-check if there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, the change in excess reserves can be expressed as:\n\nChange in excess reserves = change in total reserves - change in required reserves\n\nWe know the change in total reserves is +$1000 (the deposit), and the change in excess reserves is +$700.\n\nSo:\n\n700 = 1000 - change in required reserves\n\nTherefore, change in required reserves = 1000 - 700 = 300\n\nThe change in required reserves is due to the change in deposits, which is $1000.\n\nSo, change in required reserves = reserve ratio \u00d7 change in deposits\n\n300 = r \u00d7 1000\n\nAgain, r = 300 / 1000 = 0.30 or 30%\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. But let's see if this makes sense in terms of the bank's balance sheet.\n\nSuppose the bank had no excess reserves initially, just to simplify. So, required reserves equal total reserves.\n\nThen, with a $1000 deposit, required reserves increase by r \u00d7 1000.\n\nTotal reserves increase by 1000.\n\nSo, excess reserves = total reserves - required reserves after deposit\n\n= 1000 + (required reserves before deposit) - (required reserves before deposit + r \u00d7 1000)\n\n= 1000 - r \u00d7 1000\n\nAnd we know this equals 700.\n\nSo, 1000 - 1000r = 700\n\nAgain, r = 30%\n\nThis seems to confirm the answer.\n\nBut let's consider if the bank had excess reserves initially. Would that change things?\n\nSuppose the bank had some excess reserves before the deposit.\n\nLet\u2019s say required reserves were R_req, and total reserves were R, so excess reserves = R - R_req\n\nAfter the deposit:\n\nRequired reserves = R_req + r \u00d7 1000\n\nTotal reserves = R + 1000\n\nExcess reserves = (R + 1000) - (R_req + r \u00d7 1000) = (R - R_req) + 1000 - r \u00d7 1000\n\nBut (R - R_req) is the initial excess reserves.\n\nThe problem states that excess reserves increase by $700, so:\n\n[(R - R_req) + 1000 - r \u00d7 1000] - (R - R_req) = 700\n\nSimplify:\n\n1000 - r \u00d7 1000 = 700\n\nAgain, r = 30%\n\nSo, regardless of the initial excess reserves, the reserve ratio is 30%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 30%.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption A is 70%, which would mean required reserves increase by 700 when deposits increase by 1000. But then, total reserves increase by 1000, so excess reserves would increase by 1000 - 700 = 300, which doesn't match the given 700.\n\nOption C is 40%, which would mean required reserves increase by 400. Excess reserves would then be 1000 - 400 = 600, which is close but not exact.\n\nOption D is 90%, which would mean required reserves increase by 900. Excess reserves would be 1000 - 900 = 100, which is less than 700.\n\nThus, only option B. 30% fits the scenario where a $1000 deposit leads to an increase in excess reserves of $700.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 30\\%} \\]"
