The liberalist advocacy of cooperation as enhancing security is undermined by the failure of international organisations such as the league of nations in preventing global conflicts.\nC.

I've got these four statements here, and I need to pick the one that best describes it. Let me read them again to make sure I get it right.\n\nOption A says that liberalism believes international organizations can enhance national and international security. It also mentions that liberalism advocates including non-governmental organizations and other actors to encourage cooperation and build communities. That sounds positive and cooperative, which I think is generally associated with liberalism.\n\nOption B talks about how the liberalist advocacy of cooperation might be undermined by historical failures, like the League of Nations not being able to prevent global conflicts. So, this seems to be pointing out a potential weakness or criticism of the liberalist approach.\n\nOption C says that under different schools of thought within liberalism, there's a consensus that involvement of international organizations can undermine security by taking power away from the state. This seems contradictory because earlier options suggest that liberalism supports international cooperation, but this option says it disempowers the state.\n\nOption D says all of the above, which would mean that all three statements are accurate representations of the liberalist attitude.\n\nNow, I need to think critically about this. Liberalism is a broad ideology, and its views on international relations can vary. But from what I recall, liberalism generally supports international cooperation and the role of international organizations in promoting peace and security.\n\nSo, Option A seems to align with that view. But Option B is pointing out that sometimes, these organizations haven't been effective, like the League of Nations failing to prevent World War II. That's a valid point, but it's more of a criticism rather than a description of the attitude.\n\nOption C is interesting because it suggests that liberalism sees international organizations as potentially undermining state sovereignty, which could be a concern for some liberal thinkers. However, I think that's more aligned with realist perspectives, which emphasize the sovereignty of the state and are suspicious of international organizations that might challenge that.\n\nSo, if I had to choose between these options, I'd say Option A is the most accurate description of the liberalist attitude towards international organizations. Liberalism does support the idea that these organizations can enhance security and promote cooperation among states and other actors.\n\nBut wait, Option B is also relevant because it mentions a limitation or a critique of this approach. However, I don't think that makes it the best description of the attitude itself. It's more of a reflection on the effectiveness of the approach.\n\nOption C seems to contradict the general liberalist position by suggesting that international organizations undermine security by disempowering states. That sounds more like a realist or perhaps a critical theory perspective, not liberalism.\n\nTherefore, I don't think Option D is correct because not all of the options accurately represent the liberalist attitude.\n\nSo, my final answer is Option A. It directly states that liberalism holds international organizations can enhance security and advocates including various actors to promote cooperation and community building. That seems consistent with liberalist thought.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
