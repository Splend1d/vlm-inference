The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I ate broccoli, human liver, fava beans, with a nice chianti.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit unusual. Broccoli and fava beans are vegetables, and chianti is a type of wine. But the mention of human liver is what stands out. Eating human liver is generally considered morally wrong and illegal in the US because it involves cannibalism, which is against the law and ethical norms. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this would be considered wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I ate the yogurt in the break room because it had my coworker's name on it.\" Okay, so this involves eating someone else's yogurt without permission. In most workplaces and social settings, taking someone else's food without asking is considered disrespectful and morally wrong. It's a matter of respect for others' property and boundaries. So, in this case, it would also be considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios are considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. So, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me consider if there are any contexts where these actions might be acceptable. For the first scenario, maybe in a cultural or religious context where certain practices are allowed, but in the US, cannibalism is universally condemned. As for the second scenario, unless the yogurt was offered or abandoned, taking it without permission is generally seen as wrong.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
