The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.\"\n\u2014John C.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about John C. Calhoun's \"South Carolina Exposition and Protest\" from 1828. It's asking what issue led to the passage of this excerpt. The options are:\n\nA. The removal of American Indians from the South.\n\nB. The rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States.\n\nC. The passage of an act creating higher tariff rates.\n\nD. The funding of \"internal improvements.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of Calhoun's Exposition and Protest. I know that John C. Calhoun was a prominent political figure in the early 19th century, known for his strong advocacy of states' rights and southern interests. The Exposition and Protest was his response to the Tariff of 1828, often called the \"Tariff of Abominations,\" which imposed high taxes on imported goods.\n\nCalhoun believed that this tariff favored northern industrial interests at the expense of the southern agricultural economy, which relied heavily on exports. He argued that states had the right to nullify federal laws that they deemed unconstitutional, particularly tariffs that were harmful to their economies.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. The removal of American Indians from the South.\n\nWhile this was a significant issue in the 1830s, particularly with the Trail of Tears under Andrew Jackson's presidency, it doesn't directly relate to Calhoun's Exposition and Protest in 1828. The Exposition was specifically about states' rights and the tariff issue.\n\nB. The rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States.\n\nThe Bank War, involving the Second Bank of the United States, was another major issue in the 1830s, again under Jackson's presidency. While Calhoun was involved in these debates, the Exposition and Protest was primarily focused on the tariff issue in 1828.\n\nC. The passage of an act creating higher tariff rates.\n\nThis seems directly relevant. The Tariff of 1828 raised rates on imported goods, which was a major point of contention for southern states like South Carolina, which were dependent on exports and felt burdened by high tariffs on imported manufacturing goods.\n\nD. The funding of \"internal improvements.\"\n\nInternal improvements refer to infrastructure projects like roads and canals, which were often proposed and funded by the federal government. While there was debate over the constitutionality of such spending, it wasn't the primary focus of Calhoun's Exposition and Protest.\n\nGiven this context, option C seems the most accurate answer. Calhoun's Exposition was a direct response to the Tariff of 1828, which imposed higher tariff rates, sparking a crisis over states' rights and the constitutionality of such federal actions.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the excerpt provided:\n\n\"It would seem impossible to deny to the States the right of deciding on the infractions of their powers, and the proper remedy to be applied for their correction. The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition.\"\n\nThis passage emphasizes the states' right to judge and decide on the infringement of their powers, suggesting that without this right, they would lose their sovereignty and become subordinate to the federal government. This aligns with Calhoun's doctrine of nullification, which\u4e3b\u5f20 that states could declare federal laws unconstitutional and null within their borders.\n\nThe Tariff of 1828 was the immediate catalyst for this argument because South Carolina and other southern states felt that the tariff was unconstitutional and harmful to their economies. Calhoun's Exposition laid the intellectual foundation for the states' rights position and the subsequent Nullification Crisis of 1832-1833.\n\nTherefore, the issue that precipitated the passage excerpted above was indeed the passage of an act creating higher tariff rates, which was the Tariff of 1828.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
