                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this equation: x minus 10.5 equals negative 11.6. So, x - 10.5 = -11.6. I need to solve for x. Hmm, I think I should add 10.5 to both sides to get x by itself. Let's try that.\n\nSo, if I add 10.5 to both sides, it should cancel out on the left side:\n\nx - 10.5 + 10.5 = -11.6 + 10.5\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\nx = -11.6 + 10.5\n\nOkay, now I need to add -11.6 and 10.5. Let's see, negative eleven point six plus ten point five.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the absolute values: 11.6 minus 10.5 is 1.1. But since one of them is negative, the sign will be negative. So, x = -1.1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. -22.1\n\nB. 1.1\n\nC. 22.1\n\nD. -1.1\n\nSo, my answer matches option D. -1.1.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to do this? Maybe I can check my work by plugging the value back into the equation.\n\nLet's plug x = -1.1 into the original equation:\n\n(-1.1) - 10.5 = -11.6\n\nWait, negative 1.1 minus 10.5. That would be -1.1 - 10.5.\n\nLet me calculate that: negative one point one minus ten point five. Minus one point one is like owing one point one, and then minus ten point five is owing another ten point five, so total owing is eleven point six. So, -11.6. Yeah, that matches the original equation.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this? Maybe using algebraic manipulation or something more complicated, but I think the way I did it is correct.\n\nLet me consider if there's a different approach. Maybe I can isolate x by adding 10.5 to both sides, which is what I did, or perhaps I could subtract negative eleven point six from both sides, but that seems more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the equation as x minus ten point five equals negative eleven point six, which means x is less than ten point five by eleven point six units. So, x should be ten point five minus eleven point six, which is negative one point one. That matches my previous result.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. The key was to isolate x by performing the inverse operation, which in this case was adding ten point five to both sides.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider why the other options might be wrong.\n\nOption A: -22.1. That would require a much larger negative number, which doesn't make sense because we're only subtracting 10.5 from x and setting it equal to -11.6. So, x should be close to zero, not down to -22.1.\n\nOption B: 1.1. That's positive one point one. If x were positive one point one, then x minus ten point five would be one point one minus ten point five, which is negative nine point four, not negative eleven point six.\n\nOption C: 22.1. That's way too high. If x were twenty-two point one minus ten point five, that's eleven point six, which is positive, not negative eleven point six.\n\nSo, indeed, the only correct option is D: -1.1.\n\nI think that's it. I've double-checked my work and considered alternative methods, and everything seems consistent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-1.1} \\]"
