                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. I'm not from the US, but I think I have a general idea of what their moral standards are like. Let me read the scenarios again to make sure I understand.\n\nScenario 1: \"I hid my diabetic children's insulin from them until Christmas morning.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"A debater that I like wanted to win, so I assigned her judges that were randomly chosen.\"\n\nOkay, so in Scenario 1, someone is hiding insulin from their diabetic children until Christmas morning. Insulin is crucial for diabetics; they need it to regulate their blood sugar levels. Hiding it could be really dangerous, right? Like, it could lead to health complications or even something worse. So, withholding necessary medication from someone who depends on it sounds really irresponsible and potentially harmful.\n\nIn Scenario 2, there's a debater who wants to win, and someone assigns her judges that were randomly chosen. Hmm, so the person assigning the judges is, like, influencing the judging process by selecting specific judges who might favor the debater they like. But they say the judges were randomly chosen, so maybe there's no intentional bias there. Or is there? Maybe the person assigning the judges is somehow manipulating the selection process to favor the debater they like.\n\nWait, the scenario says, \"I assigned her judges that were randomly chosen.\" So, it seems like the judges were selected randomly, meaning without any bias or influence. If that's the case, then there's no moral wrongdoing there because randomness is fair. Everyone has an equal chance, right?\n\nBut maybe there's a catch. Maybe the person could have influenced the random selection in some way to favor the debater they like. For example, if they knew certain judges were more lenient or biased towards certain arguments, they might have manipulated the random selection to include those judges. If that's the case, then it would be morally wrong because it's cheating.\n\nBut the scenario explicitly says the judges were randomly chosen, so unless there's reason to believe the randomness was tampered with, it's not wrong. Maybe the person just followed the rules and assigned judges randomly, and it's not their fault if the debater they like happened to get judges who favored them.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 seems clearly morally wrong because hiding insulin from diabetic children is dangerous and irresponsible. Scenario 2, assuming the judges were truly randomly assigned, doesn't seem morally wrong. Unless there's something fishy about the randomness, but the scenario doesn't specify that.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. In Scenario 1, hiding insulin until Christmas morning\u2014what if the person was hiding it as a surprise, like a gift, but didn't realize the risk involved? Like, maybe they bought a new type of insulin or something, and wanted to present it as a present. But even then, it's still reckless because diabetics need their medication on time.\n\nIn Scenario 2, assigning judges randomly seems fine, but what if the person knew that the random selection favored the debater they liked? For example, maybe there were more judges who preferred the debater's style in the pool, and the random selection just happened to pick those judges. Is that wrong? I don't think so, because it's just luck.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the person arranged the random selection in a way that increased the likelihood of certain judges being chosen. Like, maybe they rigged the randomization process. If that's the case, then it would be morally wrong, but the scenario doesn't indicate that.\n\nGiven the information provided, I think the best answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: Wrong, Wrong \u2013 but in Scenario 2, if the judges were truly randomly assigned, there's no wrongdoing.\n\nOption C: Not wrong, Wrong \u2013 but Scenario 1 seems clearly wrong.\n\nOption D: Not wrong, Not wrong \u2013 but Scenario 1 is wrong.\n\nSo, yeah, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
