                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this legal scenario about a campaign worker who's been charged with conspiracy to violate election bribery laws. The worker was offering transportation to the polls on election day, promising free food, drinks, and other \"prizes\" for those who voted. Two undercover police officers went to the event, agreed to be taken to vote in exchange for $50 each, and then arrested the worker once he drove them to the alleged polling location.\n\nNow, the defense is arguing that it's legally impossible to commit the crime because the agents weren't registered to vote in that district and never intended to allow a crime to be committed. The motion to dismiss is based on this legal impossibility. I need to figure out whether the trial court is likely to grant this motion.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"legal impossibility\" means in the context of criminal law. Legal impossibility refers to a situation where the defendant believes they are committing a crime, but due to some legal fact, their actions don't actually constitute a crime. For example, if someone tries to bribe a public official who turns out to be an undercover police officer with no authority to accept bribes, the defendant might argue that it was legally impossible to commit the crime because the official had no real authority to be bribed.\n\nIn this case, the defense is arguing that the agents were not registered to vote in the district, and they never intended to commit any crime. So, the worker couldn't have conspired to commit a crime with them because the agents weren't genuine participants in the criminal act.\n\nBut wait, conspiracy is a separate offense from the substantive crime. Conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime, coupled with an overt act in furtherance of that agreement. So, even if the underlying crime couldn't be completed for some reason, the conspiracy itself is still a crime because the agreement and the intent to commit the crime are what's being punished.\n\nIn this scenario, the worker agreed to transport the agents to vote in exchange for money, which sounds like a bribe. The agents, being police officers, were part of a sting operation, pretending to be co-conspirators. However, in law, a conspiracy requires at least two people who are capable of committing the crime. If one of the parties is a police officer acting undercover, does that affect the validity of the conspiracy charge?\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, conspiring with a police officer who is not a co-conspirator might not constitute a valid conspiracy because there's no real agreement between two parties to commit a crime. But I think this can vary depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If the worker believed that the agents were genuine voters and agreed to bribe them by offering transportation in exchange for their votes, that would be a conspiracy to commit bribery. The fact that the agents were police officers and never intended to vote might complicate things, but the worker had the intent to commit the crime and took steps to facilitate it by driving them to the polling place.\n\nMoreover, the worker was offering free food, drinks, and other prizes for voting, which could be seen as inducements to vote, potentially violating election laws.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because legal impossibility is a defense to the crime of conspiracy.\n\nBut, as I thought earlier, conspiracy is about the agreement and the intent, not necessarily about whether the crime was completed. So, even if the agents couldn't actually vote, the worker had the intent to bribe voters, which is still a crime.\n\nB. Yes, because he could not be guilty of conspiring with two law enforcement agents who never intended to commit the crime.\n\nThis seems similar to the entrapment defense, where the government induces someone to commit a crime they wouldn't otherwise have committed. However, entrapment isn't directly related to legal impossibility. Moreover, the worker was offering these services to the general public, not just to the agents. So, it's likely that he was willing to do this with actual voters.\n\nC. No, because the basis of the conspiracy charge is the agreement to commit the act, along with an affirmative step in that direction.\n\nThis seems plausible. The worker agreed to transport the agents to vote in exchange for money, which is an agreement to commit bribery. Driving them to the polling place is an overt act in furtherance of that agreement. So, the elements of conspiracy seem to be present.\n\nD. No, because when the worker drove the agents to the voting place, he committed the complete crime of bribery and the conspiracy was an element contained within it.\n\nI'm not sure about this one. Conspiracy is a separate offense from the substantive crime of bribery. So, even if the bribery didn't go through because the agents were police officers, the conspiracy to bribe still occurred.\n\nGiven this, options A and B suggest that the motion to dismiss should be granted, while C and D suggest it should not.\n\nI think the key here is that conspiracy is about the agreement and the intent, regardless of whether the crime was actually possible or not. So, legal impossibility might not be a defense in this case.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the agents were police officers doesn't negate the worker's intent or the agreement to commit the crime.\n\nTherefore, I would say that the trial court is unlikely to grant the motion to dismiss based on legal impossibility.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check some case law on this topic. I recall that in some cases, conspiring with a police officer who is not a co-conspirator may not constitute a valid conspiracy because there's no real agreement between two parties to commit a crime. However, in other jurisdictions, the fact that one party is a police officer doesn't negate the conspiracy if the defendant had the intent and took steps to further the conspiracy.\n\nFor example, in the famous case of Sherman v. United States (1958), the Supreme Court held that a person could be convicted of conspiracy even if one of the co-conspirators was a government agent who didn't intend to further the conspiracy.\n\nSimilarly, in the context of bribery, if someone offers a bribe to a public official who is actually an undercover agent, they can still be convicted of attempting to bribe a public official.\n\nApplying this to the current scenario, the worker had the intent to bribe voters by offering transportation in exchange for their votes. The fact that the particular individuals he offered this to were police officers doesn't change his intent or the agreement to commit the crime.\n\nTherefore, the motion to dismiss based on legal impossibility is unlikely to be granted.\n\nSo, between the options, C seems to be the most accurate: no, because the basis of the conspiracy charge is the agreement to commit the act, along with an affirmative step in that direction.\n\nOption D is a bit confusing because conspiracy is a separate offense from the substantive crime; it's not just an element contained within it.\n\nTherefore, the trial court is likely to deny the motion to dismiss, and the case will proceed based on the conspiracy charge.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
