                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit involved, but I'll take it step by step. So, we have a series of events involving a woman, a tract of land, a mortgage company, and her daughter, all set against the backdrop of a jurisdiction that uses grantor-grantee indices. I need to figure out who has a cause of action against the woman if she defaults on her mortgage debt.\n\nFirst, let's understand the sequence of events:\n\n1. In 1993, the woman takes out a mortgage on a tract of land to secure a note for $25,000, due on December 31, 1993, with 9.5% interest per annum.\n\n2. In 1996, the mortgage company records the mortgage on the tract of land.\n\n3. In 2007, the woman signs a document promising to convey the tract of land to her daughter via a quitclaim deed and to pay the mortgage debt when it comes due.\n\n4. In 2008, the woman delivers a quitclaim deed to her daughter, but it doesn't mention the mortgage.\n\nNow, the question is about what happens if the woman defaults on the mortgage debt. I need to determine which of the options A through D is probably correct regarding who has a cause of action against her.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n- **Mortgage and Note:** The mortgage secures the note for $25,000 plus interest. The note is due on December 31, 1993, so it was supposed to be paid by that date.\n\n- **Recording of Mortgage:** The mortgage wasn't recorded until 1996, which is after the note's due date. In many jurisdictions, recording a mortgage perfects the lender's interest and provides notice to third parties.\n\n- **Promise to Daughter:** In 2007, the woman promises to convey the land to her daughter and to pay the mortgage debt when it comes due.\n\n- **Quitclaim Deed:** In 2008, she gives her daughter a quitclaim deed, which transfers any interest she has in the property without any warranty.\n\nNow, considering that the mortgage was recorded in 1996, after the note's due date, and that the woman transferred the property via quitclaim deed in 2008, I need to consider how these actions affect the rights of the mortgage company and the daughter.\n\nLet's consider the mortgage company first:\n\n- The mortgage company has a secured interest in the property to secure the note.\n\n- Even though the note was due in 1993, and the mortgage was recorded in 1996, the mortgage likely remains valid and enforceable if the debt hasn't been paid.\n\n- Generally, a mortgage survives until the underlying debt is satisfied or foreclosed upon.\n\n- If the woman defaults on the mortgage debt, the mortgage company can foreclose on the property to satisfy the debt.\n\nNow, regarding the daughter:\n\n- The woman promised to convey the property to her daughter and to pay the mortgage debt.\n\n- She then gave her daughter a quitclaim deed in 2008.\n\n- A quitclaim deed transfers whatever interest the grantor has in the property at the time of the transfer, without any warranty of title.\n\n- Since the mortgage was still in place when she transferred the property, the daughter likely took the property subject to the existing mortgage.\n\n- This means that the daughter is responsible for the mortgage debt unless she has some agreement to the contrary.\n\n- However, the woman also promised to pay the mortgage debt when it came due, which was in 1993.\n\nGiven that the note was due in 1993 and the mortgage was recorded in 1996, and the transfer occurred in 2008, there's a complex interplay between the mortgage, the note, and the transfer.\n\nI need to consider a few legal principles here:\n\n1. **Secured Transactions:** The mortgage secures the note. Until the note is paid, the mortgage remains valid.\n\n2. **Recording Statutes:** In many jurisdictions, recording a mortgage perfects the lender's security interest and provides constructive notice to subsequent purchasers.\n\n3. **Transfer of Property Subject to a Mortgage:** When a property is transferred via a quitclaim deed, and there's an existing mortgage, the transferee takes the property subject to the mortgage unless otherwise agreed.\n\n4. **Promises to Pay Debts:** The woman's promise to pay the mortgage debt to her daughter may create certain obligations, but these are likely between her and her daughter.\n\nGiven that the mortgage was recorded in 1996, and the transfer via quitclaim deed occurred in 2008, the daughter likely took the property subject to the existing mortgage. This means that the mortgage company still has a claim on the property to secure the note.\n\nIf the woman defaults on the mortgage debt, the mortgage company can foreclose on the property to satisfy the debt, even if the property is now in the daughter's name.\n\nAs for the daughter, since she received a quitclaim deed, she took the property subject to any existing liens or encumbrances, including the mortgage. Therefore, she is responsible for the mortgage debt unless she has an agreement with her mother to the contrary.\n\nHowever, the woman also promised to pay the mortgage debt when it came due. Since the debt was due in 1993 and she didn't pay it before transferring the property, the daughter might have a claim against her for breaching that promise.\n\nBut, the quitclaim deed didn't mention the mortgage, so perhaps the daughter was unaware of it, but since it was recorded in 1996, it should have been visible in the public record.\n\nI need to consider whether the daughter had actual or constructive notice of the mortgage when she accepted the quitclaim deed.\n\nIf she had notice, she took the property subject to the mortgage, and if she didn't pay the mortgage, the mortgage company could foreclose.\n\nIf she didn't have notice, there might be some protection for her, but in most jurisdictions, recorded mortgages provide constructive notice.\n\nAssuming the daughter had constructive notice of the mortgage, she took the property subject to it, and thus, the mortgage company has a valid claim against the property for the unpaid debt.\n\nNow, regarding causes of action:\n\n- **Mortgage Company:** It has a cause of action against the property, not necessarily directly against the woman personally, unless there are personal guarantees or something similar.\n\n- **Daughter:** She might have a cause of action against her mother for breaching the promise to pay the mortgage debt.\n\nBut the question is asking about causes of action against the woman.\n\nOption A says only the daughter has a cause of action against the woman.\n\nOption B says only the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman.\n\nOption C says both have causes of action against the woman.\n\nOption D says neither has a cause of action against the woman.\n\nFrom my analysis:\n\n- The mortgage company has a claim against the property, but does it have a direct cause of action against the woman personally? Probably, since she is the one who signed the mortgage and note.\n\n- The daughter might have a cause of action against her mother for breaching the promise to pay the mortgage debt.\n\nTherefore, both might have causes of action against the woman.\n\nBut I need to think carefully.\n\nFirst, the mortgage company:\n\n- The woman is the mortgagor, and she defaulted on the note secured by the mortgage.\n\n- The mortgage company can foreclose on the property to satisfy the debt.\n\n- If the property has been transferred to the daughter, the mortgage company can still foreclose on the property, as the mortgage is a lien on the property, not just on the woman.\n\n- Additionally, if the note includes personal liability provisions, the mortgage company might have a personal cause of action against the woman for the debt.\n\nNow, the daughter:\n\n- The woman promised to convey the property and to pay the mortgage debt.\n\n- She conveyed the property via quitclaim deed but didn't pay the mortgage debt.\n\n- Therefore, the daughter might have a cause of action against her mother for breach of promise to pay the mortgage debt.\n\n- However, if the daughter knew about the mortgage when she accepted the deed, her claim might be weaker, but promises in writing are generally enforceable.\n\nTherefore, both the mortgage company and the daughter potentially have causes of action against the woman.\n\nThe mortgage company for the debt secured by the mortgage, and the daughter for breach of promise to pay the mortgage debt.\n\nSo, option C seems the most accurate.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any possibility that the mortgage company doesn't have a cause of action against the woman personally?\n\nWell, in some mortgage agreements, especially in trust deeds, there might be personal liability clauses.\n\nBut assuming it's a standard mortgage, the woman is personally liable for the debt, and the mortgage is a security interest in the property.\n\nTherefore, the mortgage company can sue the woman personally for the debt and also foreclose on the property.\n\nSimilarly, the daughter has a contractual promise from her mother to pay the mortgage debt, so she can sue her mother for breach of that promise.\n\nTherefore, both have causes of action against the woman.\n\nOption C is probably correct.\n\nWait, but maybe there's more to it.\n\nPerhaps the daughter, by accepting the quitclaim deed, assumed the mortgage debt, especially since it was recorded and should have been known to her.\n\nIf that's the case, then her cause of action against her mother might be limited, as she assumed the debt.\n\nHowever, the promise from her mother to pay the debt might still give her a cause of action, depending on the terms of the promise.\n\nIf the promise was to pay the debt regardless of who held the property, then she might still have a claim.\n\nAlternatively, if the promise was conditional on the daughter not having to pay the mortgage, her claim might be stronger.\n\nBut without more specific terms, it's hard to say.\n\nStill, based on the information provided, it seems that both the mortgage company and the daughter have potential causes of action against the woman.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C: Both the daughter and the mortgage company have causes of action against the woman.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
