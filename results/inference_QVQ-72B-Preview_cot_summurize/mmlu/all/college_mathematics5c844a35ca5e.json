                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about polynomials over Z_5 with degree less than or equal to 7, and there's this operator D that takes a polynomial and gives its derivative. I need to find the dimensions of the null space (n) and the range (r) of this operator D.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what P is. It's the set of polynomials with coefficients in Z_5 and degree at most 7. So, these are polynomials like a_7 x^7 + a_6 x^6 + ... + a_1 x + a_0, where each a_i is in Z_5, which is the integers modulo 5.\n\nNow, D is the derivative operator, so D(p(x)) = p'(x). For example, if p(x) = a_7 x^7 + ... + a_1 x + a_0, then p'(x) = 7a_7 x^6 + 6a_6 x^5 + ... + a_1.\n\nI need to find the null space and the range of D.\n\nThe null space of D is the set of all polynomials p in P such that D(p) = 0. In other words, p'(x) = 0. For polynomials over Z_5, what does that mean?\n\nWell, if p'(x) = 0, that means that p(x) is a constant polynomial because the derivative of a constant is zero. So, p(x) = a_0, where a_0 is in Z_5.\n\nBut wait, P includes polynomials up to degree 7. So, in P, a constant polynomial is degree 0, which is less than 7. But does P include polynomials of degree less than 7 as well?\n\nWait, the problem says P is the set of polynomials with coefficients in Z_5 and degree less than or equal to 7. So, P includes all polynomials from degree 0 up to degree 7.\n\nSo, the null space of D consists of all constant polynomials, i.e., polynomials of degree 0.\n\nIn Z_5, there are 5 possible constants: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nSo, the null space has dimension n = 1.\n\nWait, but in terms of vector space dimension, the space of constant polynomials over any field has dimension 1 because they are spanned by the constant polynomial 1.\n\nSo, n = 1.\n\nNow, the range of D is the set of all possible derivatives p'(x) where p is in P.\n\nSince P includes polynomials up to degree 7, their derivatives will have degrees up to 6.\n\nSo, p(x) = a_7 x^7 + ... + a_1 x + a_0\n\np'(x) = 7a_7 x^6 + 6a_6 x^5 + ... + a_1\n\nSo, p'(x) is a polynomial of degree up to 6.\n\nNow, over Z_5, each coefficient can take 5 values (0,1,2,3,4).\n\nSo, the range of D consists of all polynomials of degree up to 6.\n\nNow, what is the dimension of the space of polynomials of degree up to 6 over Z_5?\n\nWell, the general form is b_6 x^6 + b_5 x^5 + ... + b_1 x + b_0, where each b_i is in Z_5.\n\nThis is a vector space over Z_5 with basis {x^6, x^5, ..., x, 1}.\n\nSo, the dimension is 7.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the range of D, which is the space of all possible derivatives of polynomials in P.\n\nBut P includes polynomials up to degree 7, and their derivatives are up to degree 6.\n\nSo, the range should be all polynomials of degree up to 6, which is a 7-dimensional space.\n\nBut looking back at the options:\n\nA. n = 1 and r = 6\n\nB. n = 1 and r = 7\n\nC. n = 2 and r = 5\n\nD. n = 2 and r = 6\n\nAccording to my reasoning, n = 1 and r = 7, which corresponds to option B.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs the null space really just the constants? Yes, because the derivative of a non-constant polynomial is not zero.\n\nIn any field, the space of constant polynomials has dimension 1.\n\nAnd the range of D is the space of all possible derivatives, which for degree 7 polynomials, is up to degree 6, which is a 7-dimensional space.\n\nSo, the answer should be B: n = 1 and r = 7.\n\nWait, but maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIs there any polynomial in P whose derivative is zero besides the constants?\n\nNo, because if p(x) has degree greater than 0, then p'(x) will be non-zero.\n\nSo, null space is indeed just the constants, dimension 1.\n\nAnd the range is all polynomials of degree up to 6, which is dimension 7.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any trick here.\n\nThe problem mentions Z_5, which is a finite field, but derivative is well-defined over finite fields in the same way as over infinite fields.\n\nSo, my reasoning should hold.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: n = 1 and r = 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{B}\\]"
