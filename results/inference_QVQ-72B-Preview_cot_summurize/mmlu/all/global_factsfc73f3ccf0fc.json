                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"At the time of independence, there were already hundreds of thousands of university graduates in ____, but hardly any at all in ____.\" And the options are:\n\nA. India, Congo\n\nB. India, South Korea\n\nC. Congo, South Korea\n\nD. South Korea, India\n\nAlright, I need to figure out which pair of countries fits this description. The key points are:\n\n- One country had hundreds of thousands of university graduates at independence.\n\n- The other country had hardly any university graduates at that time.\n\nFirst, I need to recall when each of these countries gained independence.\n\nStarting with India: India gained independence from British rule in 1947.\n\nCongo: The Congo gained independence from Belgium in 1960.\n\nSouth Korea: South Korea declared independence from Japan in 1948.\n\nOkay, so all three countries gained independence in the mid-20th century, with India and South Korea in the late 1940s and Congo in the 1960s.\n\nNow, I need to think about the state of higher education in these countries around those times.\n\nLet's consider India first. India has a long history of higher education, with institutions like the University of Calcutta, which was established in 1857, and other universities founded in the 19th and early 20th centuries. So, by the time of independence in 1947, India already had a well-established university system.\n\nI recall that in 1947, India had several universities and a significant number of colleges affiliated with them. Estimates suggest that there were around 20 universities and over 700 colleges in India at that time. Given that, the number of university graduates would have been substantial, possibly in the hundreds of thousands.\n\nNow, moving on to Congo. Congo gained independence in 1960. At that time, the education system was largely run by Belgian missionaries and the colonial government. Higher education in Congo was limited before independence. The only higher education institution was the Universit\u00e9 Associ\u00e9e du Haut-Congo, established in 1956, which was just four years before independence.\n\nGiven the short time frame and the limited access to higher education under colonial rule, it's unlikely that Congo had a large number of university graduates by 1960. In fact, I believe the number was quite small, perhaps only a few hundred, which would align with the statement \"hardly any at all.\"\n\nLastly, South Korea. South Korea declared independence from Japan in 1948. Prior to that, during the Japanese colonial period from 1910 to 1945, higher education was controlled by the Japanese. Seoul National University was established in 1946, after the end of the colonial period.\n\nGiven the disruptions caused by World War II and the Japanese occupation, higher education in South Korea in the late 1940s was still in its early stages of development post-independence. However, there were some universities and colleges operating during the Japanese colonial period, albeit with limitations.\n\nBut compared to India, which had a much longer history of higher education, South Korea's higher education system was nascent at the time of independence. Still, it's possible that there were some university graduates, but perhaps not in the hundreds of thousands.\n\nPutting this together, it seems that India had a more developed higher education system with a larger number of graduates at the time of independence, whereas Congo and South Korea had less developed systems with fewer graduates.\n\nBetween Congo and South Korea, Congo gained independence later, in 1960, and had an even more limited higher education system prior to independence.\n\nSouth Korea, although it gained independence in 1948, had some higher education institutions, though they were fewer and less established compared to India.\n\nSo, if I had to choose between the options, I would say that India had hundreds of thousands of university graduates at independence, and Congo had hardly any.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. India, Congo.\n\nBut let me double-check this.\n\nI found that in 1947, India had around 20 universities and over 700 colleges, which suggests a substantial number of graduates.\n\nIn Congo, by 1960, the number of university graduates was very limited, possibly only a few hundred, due to the late establishment of higher education institutions and the short time frame before independence.\n\nSouth Korea, while it did have some higher education institutions by 1948, the system was still recovering from the colonial period and World War II, so the number of graduates might have been lower than India's but possibly higher than Congo's.\n\nTherefore, the contrast is sharpest between India, which had a well-established higher education system, and Congo, which had a nascent one.\n\nSo, option A. India, Congo seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
