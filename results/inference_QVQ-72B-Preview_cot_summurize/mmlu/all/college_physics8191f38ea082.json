                    "text": "So I have this problem about organ pipes and their harmonics. It says that the first five harmonics for an organ pipe open at both ends are 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz. Then, it asks which of these harmonics will still be present once the pipe is closed at one end. The options are:\n\nA. 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz only\n\nB. 100 Hz and 200 Hz only\n\nC. 150 Hz and 250 Hz only\n\nD. None\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall how the harmonics for organ pipes work, especially the difference between pipes open at both ends and pipes closed at one end.\n\nI remember that for an organ pipe open at both ends, the possible frequencies are given by:\n\n\\[ f_n = n \\times f_1 \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is an integer starting from 1, and \\( f_1 \\) is the fundamental frequency.\n\nGiven that, the first five harmonics for an open pipe should be multiples of the fundamental frequency. Looking at the frequencies provided: 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz, it seems like the fundamental frequency \\( f_1 \\) is 50 Hz, and these are the first five harmonics: \\( f_1 = 50 \\) Hz, \\( f_2 = 100 \\) Hz, \\( f_3 = 150 \\) Hz, \\( f_4 = 200 \\) Hz, and \\( f_5 = 250 \\) Hz.\n\nNow, when the pipe is closed at one end, the possible frequencies change. For a pipe closed at one end, the harmonics are given by:\n\n\\[ f_n = n \\times f_1 \\]\n\nbut here, \\( n \\) is only odd integers: 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. So, only the odd harmonics are present in a pipe closed at one end.\n\nGiven that, I need to identify which of the original five harmonics (from the open pipe) are odd multiples of the fundamental frequency.\n\nLet's list them:\n\n- \\( f_1 = 50 \\) Hz (n=1, which is odd)\n\n- \\( f_2 = 100 \\) Hz (n=2, even)\n\n- \\( f_3 = 150 \\) Hz (n=3, odd)\n\n- \\( f_4 = 200 \\) Hz (n=4, even)\n\n- \\( f_5 = 250 \\) Hz (n=5, odd)\n\nSo, from the original five, the odd harmonics are \\( f_1 = 50 \\) Hz, \\( f_3 = 150 \\) Hz, and \\( f_5 = 250 \\) Hz.\n\nTherefore, these are the harmonics that would still be present once the pipe is closed at one end.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A says 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz only, which matches exactly with what I just concluded.\n\nBut wait a minute, I should double-check if there are any other harmonics that could possibly match or if there's something I'm missing.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the formula for the frequencies in a pipe closed at one end. Yes, for a pipe closed at one end, the resonant frequencies are given by:\n\n\\[ f_n = \\frac{v}{4L} (2n - 1) \\]\n\nwhere \\( v \\) is the speed of sound, and \\( L \\) is the length of the pipe. This simplifies to:\n\n\\[ f_n = n \\times f_1 \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., only odd integers.\n\nSo, the fundamental frequency \\( f_1 \\) for a closed pipe is \\( \\frac{v}{4L} \\), whereas for an open pipe, it's \\( \\frac{v}{2L} \\).\n\nGiven that, when the pipe is closed at one end, the fundamental frequency changes, and only the odd harmonics of the new fundamental are present.\n\nIn this problem, the original fundamental frequency for the open pipe is 50 Hz. When the pipe is closed at one end, the new fundamental frequency should be \\( \\frac{v}{4L} \\), which is half of the open pipe fundamental frequency, i.e., 25 Hz.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. If the open pipe has a fundamental frequency of 50 Hz, then closing one end should change the fundamental frequency to 25 Hz, because \\( f_{closed} = \\frac{1}{2} f_{open} \\).\n\nBut in the problem, the pipe is initially open at both ends with harmonics at 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz. If we close one end, the new set of possible harmonics should be based on the new fundamental frequency of 25 Hz, with harmonics at 25 Hz, 75 Hz, 125 Hz, 175 Hz, 225 Hz, etc.\n\nNow, among the original harmonics (50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, 250 Hz), which of these coincide with the harmonics of the closed pipe?\n\nLet's list the harmonics of the closed pipe:\n\n- \\( f_1 = 25 \\) Hz\n\n- \\( f_3 = 75 \\) Hz\n\n- \\( f_5 = 125 \\) Hz\n\n- \\( f_7 = 175 \\) Hz\n\n- \\( f_9 = 225 \\) Hz\n\n- \\( f_{11} = 275 \\) Hz\n\nComparing this list with the original harmonics, none of the original harmonics match any of the closed pipe harmonics. The closest is 50 Hz, which is \\( f_2 \\) for the closed pipe, but that's 50 Hz, which doesn't match 75 Hz for \\( f_3 \\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the odd harmonics of the open pipe would still be present in the closed pipe, but now it seems that they don't match the new harmonic series of the closed pipe.\n\nI must be missing something here. Let's think differently.\n\nPerhaps the question is asking which of the original harmonics could potentially still resonate in the closed pipe, meaning which of these frequencies could be part of the new set of harmonics for the closed pipe.\n\nGiven that, we need to see which of the original frequencies match any of the closed pipe harmonics.\n\nFrom the list above, none of the original frequencies (50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, 250 Hz) match any of the closed pipe harmonics (25 Hz, 75 Hz, 125 Hz, 175 Hz, 225 Hz, 275 Hz, etc.).\n\nTherefore, none of the original harmonics will survive once the pipe is closed at one end.\n\nBut wait, the answer option A suggests that 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz are still present, but according to my calculations, none of these match the closed pipe harmonics.\n\nIs there a possibility that some of these frequencies could still resonate in the closed pipe, even if they are not exact multiples of the new fundamental?\n\nI don't think so, because the resonant frequencies are strictly determined by the boundary conditions of the pipe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem.\n\nLet me consider that when the pipe is closed at one end, only odd harmonics of the new fundamental are allowed, as established earlier.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the question is to identify which of the original harmonics correspond to the odd harmonics of the open pipe, since those would still be present in the closed pipe.\n\nWait, but in the open pipe, all harmonics (both even and odd) are present, whereas in the closed pipe, only odd harmonics are present, relative to the new fundamental.\n\nSo, perhaps the overlap is only for the frequencies that correspond to the odd harmonics of the open pipe, which in this case are 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz.\n\nBut as I calculated earlier, these don't correspond to the harmonics of the closed pipe, because the fundamental frequency changes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fundamental frequency remains the same, but that doesn't make sense physically, because the fundamental frequency for a closed pipe is different from that of an open pipe.\n\nWait, no, the fundamental frequency does change when you close one end.\n\nLet me recall that for an open pipe, \\( f_1 = \\frac{v}{2L} \\), and for a closed pipe, \\( f_1 = \\frac{v}{4L} \\), which is half of the open pipe fundamental.\n\nSo, if the open pipe has \\( f_1 = 50 \\) Hz, then the closed pipe would have \\( f_1 = 25 \\) Hz.\n\nTherefore, the harmonics for the closed pipe would be at 25 Hz, 75 Hz, 125 Hz, 175 Hz, 225 Hz, etc.\n\nComparing this to the original harmonics: 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, 250 Hz, none of these match the closed pipe harmonics.\n\nTherefore, none of the original harmonics will survive once the pipe is closed at one end.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D says \"None,\" which seems to be the correct answer based on this reasoning.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because the problem might be interpreted differently. Maybe it's asking which of the original harmonics can still be produced by the pipe when closed at one end, regardless of the fundamental frequency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the fundamental frequency calculation.\n\nLet me double-check the relationship between the fundamental frequencies of open and closed pipes.\n\nFor an open pipe, the wavelength of the fundamental mode is \\( \\lambda = 2L \\), so \\( f_1 = \\frac{v}{2L} \\).\n\nFor a closed pipe, the wavelength of the fundamental mode is \\( \\lambda = 4L \\), so \\( f_1 = \\frac{v}{4L} \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( f_{closed} = \\frac{1}{2} f_{open} \\).\n\nGiven that, if the open pipe has \\( f_1 = 50 \\) Hz, then the closed pipe has \\( f_1 = 25 \\) Hz, as previously determined.\n\nTherefore, the harmonics for the closed pipe are multiples of 25 Hz, specifically odd multiples: 25 Hz, 75 Hz, 125 Hz, 175 Hz, 225 Hz, etc.\n\nComparing to the original harmonics: 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, 250 Hz, none of these match the closed pipe harmonics.\n\nTherefore, none of the original harmonics will survive once the pipe is closed at one end.\n\nHence, the correct answer should be option D: None.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that some of the original harmonics could still be present in the closed pipe.\n\nPerhaps if the pipe is closed at one end, the higher harmonics could still be excited, even if they don't exactly match the frequencies of the closed pipe harmonics.\n\nHowever, in reality, the resonant frequencies are strictly determined by the pipe's boundary conditions, and only those specific frequencies can be excited.\n\nTherefore, unless there's an exact match between the original harmonic and one of the closed pipe harmonics, which in this case there isn't, none of the original harmonics will survive.\n\nThus, the answer is option D: None.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
