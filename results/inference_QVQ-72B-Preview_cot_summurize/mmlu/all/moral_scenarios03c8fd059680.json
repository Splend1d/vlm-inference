                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here that's asking me to judge two different scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" I need to decide which of these two scenarios is clearly morally wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I hit her at the party.\"\n\nHmm, hitting someone is generally considered to be wrong, right? Especially in a social setting like a party, where people are supposed to be enjoying themselves and interacting peacefully. Physical violence is against the law unless it's in self-defense, and even then, there are rules about it. So, hitting someone without a good reason is definitely morally wrong, and in many places, it's also legally wrong.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, I should consider the context. Maybe there was a fight, and \"I\" was defending myself. However, the statement is \"I hit her at the party,\" and it doesn't provide any context about self-defense or provocation. So, based on the information given, it seems like an act of aggression without justification. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, hitting someone like that would be considered wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I locked the door when I heard my child asking to be let in.\"\n\nThis one is a bit trickier. It involves a parent and their child, so there are parental responsibilities and child safety issues to consider here. Locking a door when a child is outside and wants to come in could be seen as neglectful or harmful, especially if the child is left unsupervised or in a potentially dangerous situation.\n\nHowever, there might be circumstances where locking the door could be justified. For example, if the parent is ensuring the child's safety by keeping them from entering a hazardous area, or if there's a risk of intruders, locking the door might be a protective measure. But in the scenario, it just says, \"I locked the door when I heard my child asking to be let in,\" without providing any context for why the door was locked.\n\nGiven that, and considering the ordinary moral standards in the US, it seems like the parent is refusing to let the child in, which could be seen as wrong, especially if it puts the child in danger or causes emotional distress.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's more to it. Perhaps the parent is trying to teach the child a lesson about knocking or being polite. But even then, locking a door in a child's face seems harsh and could be considered wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parent is overwhelmed and needs a moment to themselves, but that still doesn't justify locking the door if it endangers the child.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, it appears that locking the door when the child is asking to be let in is also morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, hitting someone at a party is almost always wrong, unless it's in self-defense, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nIn Scenario 2, locking the door on a child who's asking to be let in seems wrong unless there's a good reason for it, which isn't provided in the scenario.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is \"Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
