                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem: \"A company makes 5 blue cars for every 3 white cars it makes. If the company makes 15 white cars in one day, how many blue cars will it make?\"\n\nOkay, so first I need to understand the relationship between the number of blue cars and white cars. It says the company makes 5 blue cars for every 3 white cars. That sounds like a ratio, right? So, the ratio of blue cars to white cars is 5 to 3.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many blue cars are made if there are 15 white cars produced in one day. Hmm, ratios and proportions seem relevant here. Maybe I can set up a proportion to solve this.\n\nLet me write down what I know:\n\nBlue cars : White cars = 5 : 3\n\nAnd I know that the number of white cars is 15. So, I need to find the number of blue cars that corresponds to 15 white cars.\n\nLet's set up the proportion:\n\n5/3 = x/15\n\nWhere x is the number of blue cars I'm trying to find.\n\nTo solve for x, I can cross-multiply:\n\n5 * 15 = 3 * x\n\nSo, 75 = 3x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3:\n\nx = 75 / 3\n\nx = 25\n\nWait a minute, that can't be right. If 5 blue cars correspond to 3 white cars, then increasing the number of white cars to 15, which is 5 times 3, should multiply the number of blue cars by the same factor. So, 5 blue cars times 5 should be 25 blue cars.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of units. If 3 white cars correspond to 5 blue cars, then for every 3 white cars, there are 5 blue cars.\n\nSo, if there are 15 white cars, how many sets of 3 white cars are there in 15? Well, 15 divided by 3 is 5. So, there are 5 sets of 3 white cars in 15 white cars.\n\nSince each set of 3 white cars corresponds to 5 blue cars, then 5 sets would correspond to 5 times 5 blue cars, which is also 25 blue cars.\n\nHmm, I'm getting the same answer again, which is reassuring.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe using the concept of direct variation.\n\nIf blue cars vary directly with white cars, then blue cars = k * white cars, where k is the constant of variation.\n\nFrom the given ratio, 5 blue cars / 3 white cars = k, so k = 5/3.\n\nTherefore, blue cars = (5/3) * white cars.\n\nSo, if white cars are 15, then blue cars = (5/3) * 15.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n(5/3) * 15 = (5 * 15) / 3 = 75 / 3 = 25.\n\nAgain, I get 25 blue cars.\n\nWait, but the question is multiple choice, and 25 is one of the options. So, maybe it's correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other factor that could affect this.\n\nIs there any possibility of other variables or conditions that I'm missing? The problem seems straightforward: it's just about the ratio of blue to white cars based on the given production rates.\n\nI don't think there's more to it. It appears that the answer should be 25 blue cars.\n\nLet me check if there's a trick here. Maybe the ratio isn't exactly 5 to 3, but perhaps it's a different ratio that I need to adjust for.\n\nBut no, the problem states clearly that the company makes 5 blue cars for every 3 white cars. So, the ratio is consistent.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it sufficiently. The answer should be 25 blue cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]"
