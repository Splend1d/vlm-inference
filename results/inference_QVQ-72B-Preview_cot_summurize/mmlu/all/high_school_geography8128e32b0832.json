                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"The distance north and south of the equator is the...\" and the options are A. global grid system, B. Prime Meridian, C. latitude, D. longitude. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what each of these terms means. Starting with the global grid system: I think that's the entire system of lines used to identify locations on the Earth's surface. It includes both lines of latitude and longitude. So, it's not specifically about distance north or south of the equator, but rather a comprehensive system for positioning. Maybe option A isn't the right choice here.\n\nNext, the Prime Meridian. I remember that this is the line of 0\u00b0 longitude, passing through Greenwich, England. It's used as a reference point for measuring east and west positions. But again, this seems to be related to longitude, which measures east-west positions, not north-south distances from the equator. So, perhaps option B isn't the correct answer either.\n\nNow, latitude. I think latitude measures how far north or south a place is from the equator. The equator is at 0\u00b0 latitude, and then you have degrees increasing as you go north or south. For example, the North Pole is at 90\u00b0 north latitude, and the South Pole is at 90\u00b0 south latitude. So, this sounds like it directly relates to the distance north or south of the equator.\n\nLastly, longitude. This measures how far east or west a place is from the Prime Meridian. It ranges from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 east or west. So, unlike latitude, which measures the north-south position, longitude measures the east-west position. Therefore, it doesn't fit the description of being the distance north or south of the equator.\n\nGiven these explanations, it seems that latitude is the correct choice here. It specifically measures the distance north or south of the equator, which is exactly what the question is asking.\n\nWait a minute, but just to make sure, let me think about it again. The question says \"the distance north and south of the equator is the...\" and provides four options. Option C is latitude. Yes, that makes sense because latitude is defined by lines running parallel to the equator, and the degrees indicate the distance from the equator.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider an example. Suppose I'm at 45\u00b0 north latitude. That means I'm 45 degrees north of the equator. Similarly, if I'm at 30\u00b0 south latitude, I'm 30 degrees south of the equator. So, latitude clearly represents the distance north or south of the equator.\n\nOn the other hand, longitude measures the angular distance east or west from the Prime Meridian, which is a north-south line. So, it's measuring a different aspect\u2014positional placement east or west, not north or south.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. latitude.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. latitude}} \\]"
