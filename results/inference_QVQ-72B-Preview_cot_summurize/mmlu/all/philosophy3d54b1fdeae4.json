                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what Ross means by justice. The options are:\n\nA. When all laws are followed.\n\nB. When contracts and promises are adhered to.\n\nC. When the distribution of happiness is in accordance with merit.\n\nD. When the guilty are punished for their crimes.\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand who Ross is in this context. I think William Ross was an ethical theorist who contributed to the development of prima facie duties in ethics. He believed that there are multiple basic moral duties that can conflict, and we have to balance them in making moral decisions.\n\nGiven that background, his view of justice might be related to these prima facie duties. So, let's consider each option.\n\nOption A: When all laws are followed.\n\nWell, Ross was a proponent of natural law theory, which holds that there are moral laws derived from human nature and reason, not just positive law (laws made by human beings). So, following all human-made laws might not necessarily equate to justice if those laws are unjust or against natural law. Ross might argue that justice goes beyond merely obeying the law.\n\nOption B: When contracts and promises are adhered to.\n\nRoss did emphasize the importance of keeping promises and fulfilling contracts as part of our moral duties. He considered promise-keeping as a prima facie duty. So, adhering to contracts and promises is important for justice. But is this the only aspect of justice? Probably not. Justice might involve more than just keeping promises and contracts.\n\nOption C: When the distribution of happiness is in accordance with merit.\n\nThis sounds a bit like a utilitarian approach, where happiness or utility is distributed based on merit. Ross was critical of utilitarianism, which focuses on the greatest happiness for the greatest number, because he thought that individual rights and duties could be overridden by utilitarian considerations. So, he might not fully agree with this definition, as it still retains some utilitarian elements.\n\nOption D: When the guilty are punished for their crimes.\n\nThis seems to relate to retributive justice, which focuses on punishing wrongdoers for the sake of vengeance or moral balance. Ross did believe in the importance of justice in punishing wrongdoers, but his view was more nuanced. He thought that punishment should be proportional to the crime and should take into account the offender's moral responsibility.\n\nBut, considering Ross's overall approach, justice might encompass more than just punishment. It probably includes other aspects like fairness, equality, and the upholding of moral duties.\n\nWait a minute, maybe none of these options fully capture Ross's concept of justice. Perhaps justice, according to Ross, involves a balance of multiple prima facie duties, including fidelity (keeping promises), reparation (making amends for wrongs), gratitude (showing appreciation for benefits received), justice (fairness), and non-maleficence (not harming others).\n\nIf that's the case, then none of the given options fully represent his view. Option B touches on fidelity, but as I thought earlier, justice is more than just fidelity. Option D relates to reparation, but again, that's only one aspect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Ross would say that justice is about distributing benefits and burdens fairly, which isn't directly stated in any of the options. But that seems plausible, given his emphasis on fairness and the importance of considering multiple duties.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Ross believed in intuitive moral principles that we can know through reason. So, his understanding of justice would likely be grounded in reason and the nature of human beings.\n\nGiven that, perhaps justice, according to Ross, is about acting in ways that respect the equal moral worth of all individuals, fulfilling our duties to them, and ensuring that benefits and burdens are distributed fairly based on merit and need.\n\nBut again, none of the options seem to capture this comprehensive view.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at it differently. Perhaps Ross would define justice in terms of the golden rule: treating others as we would like to be treated ourselves. But that's not one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he would align with the social contract theory, where justice is about upholding the agreements and expectations within a society. But again, that's not directly reflected in the options.\n\nGiven the choices, I need to pick the one that comes closest to Ross's view of justice.\n\nOption A seems too limited because justice can't just be about following laws, especially if those laws are unjust.\n\nOption B is about contracts and promises, which is important, but as I thought, justice is broader than that.\n\nOption C is about distributing happiness based on merit, which has some appeal, but Ross was critical of utilitarianism, which places too much emphasis on happiness.\n\nOption D is about punishing the guilty, which is a part of justice, but again, not the whole picture.\n\nPerhaps the closest answer is Option B, since Ross emphasized the importance of promise-keeping and contract fulfillment as part of our moral duties. But I still feel like it's incomplete because justice involves more than just that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Option C is closer, as it involves distributing happiness based on merit, which aligns somewhat with Ross's emphasis on fairness and individual merit.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely convinced. Maybe I need to think about it differently.\n\nLet me consider what justice means in general. Justice is often defined as the fair and equitable treatment of individuals, the distribution of rights and obligations, and the punishment of wrongdoers.\n\nGiven that, Option D seems to cover only one aspect\u2014punishment of the guilty\u2014while ignoring other important aspects like fair distribution of goods and equitable treatment.\n\nOption B covers contracts and promises, which are important for social cooperation and trust, but again, justice is broader than just that.\n\nOption C suggests distributing happiness based on merit, which could be seen as a form of distributive justice, but it's phrased in utilitarian terms, which Ross was against.\n\nOption A, following all laws, seems too legalistic and doesn't account for situations where the law itself is unjust.\n\nPerhaps the best answer among these options is Option B, since fulfilling contracts and promises is essential for maintaining order and fairness in society, which are key aspects of justice.\n\nMoreover, in Ross's view, promise-keeping is a prima facie duty, meaning it's a duty that we should fulfill unless it conflicts with a stronger duty. So, adhering to contracts and promises is a fundamental aspect of justice.\n\nHowever, I still have doubts because justice seems to encompass more than just promise-keeping. It includes notions of fairness, equality, and the just distribution of resources and opportunities.\n\nGiven that, maybe none of the options perfectly capture Ross's concept of justice. But since I have to choose one, I'll go with Option B, as it aligns closest with his emphasis on promise-keeping and contractual obligations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
