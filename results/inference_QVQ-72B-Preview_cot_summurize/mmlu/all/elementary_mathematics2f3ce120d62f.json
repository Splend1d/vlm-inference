                    "text": "Okay, so the Sojourn family went on vacation with $2000. They spend $150 each day. I need to find an expression that shows how much money they have after x days.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. They start with $2000, and every day they spend $150. So, after one day, they would have $2000 minus $150, which is $1850. After two days, they would spend another $150, so $1850 minus $150 is $1700. And this pattern continues.\n\nSo, if I want to find out how much money they have after x days, I need an expression that subtracts $150 for each day that passes from the initial $2000.\n\nLet me consider the options given:\n\nA. 1850x\n\nThis seems like it's multiplying 1850 by x, which might be the amount spent after x days, but that doesn't seem right because they spend $150 each day, not $1850.\n\nWait, no. Actually, after one day, they spend $150, so 1850 is $2000 minus $150, which is after one day. So, 1850x would be the amount spent after x days, but that doesn't make sense because spending $150 each day, the total spent after x days should be 150x.\n\nYes, option C is 150x, which is the total amount spent after x days. But the question is asking for how much money they have after x days, not how much they've spent.\n\nSo, option A is probably incorrect.\n\nOption B: 2000 \u2212 150x\n\nThis looks promising because it seems to be starting with $2000 and subtracting $150 for each day that passes. So, after one day, it would be $2000 minus $150, which is $1850, which matches what I calculated earlier. After two days, $2000 minus $300 is $1700, and so on.\n\nOption C: 150x\n\nAs I thought before, this is the total amount spent after x days, not the remaining amount they have.\n\nOption D: 2000 + 150x\n\nThis seems incorrect because if they spend $150 each day, their remaining money should decrease, not increase. Adding 150x would mean their money increases by $150 each day, which isn't the case.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option B seems correct. But let me double-check with another approach.\n\nSuppose I think about the general formula for this situation. They start with an initial amount and spend a fixed amount each day. The remaining money after x days should be:\n\nRemaining money = Initial amount \u2212 (Daily spending \u00d7 Number of days)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nRemaining money = $2000 \u2212 ($150 \u00d7 x)\n\nWhich is exactly 2000 \u2212 150x\n\nYes, that matches option B.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the pattern:\n\nAfter 0 days: $2000\n\nAfter 1 day: $2000 \u2212 $150 = $1850\n\nAfter 2 days: $1850 \u2212 $150 = $1700\n\nAfter 3 days: $1700 \u2212 $150 = $1550\n\nAnd so on. So, the pattern is decreasing by $150 each day.\n\nMathematically, this is a linear relationship where the remaining money decreases by $150 for each day.\n\nSo, the expression 2000 \u2212 150x correctly represents this relationship.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: 2000 \u2212150x\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the question.\n\nIs there any possibility of interest, additional income, or other expenses not mentioned in the problem? The problem seems straightforward: they start with $2000 and spend $150 each day, and we need to find the remaining money after x days.\n\nNo, there doesn't seem to be any trick or additional factor to consider.\n\nHence, the answer is indeed option B: 2000 \u2212150x\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
