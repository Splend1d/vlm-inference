                    "text": "Let's see. There's this problem about an airplane dropping a payload while it's moving north at 100 m/s. The plane is parallel to the ground, and it's at a constant speed. So, no acceleration horizontally, right? And we're supposed to find the velocity of the payload relative to the plane 4.0 seconds after it's released, assuming no air resistance.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"relative to the plane\" means. I think it means how fast the payload is moving compared to the plane. So, if the plane is moving at 100 m/s north and drops the payload, what's the payload's velocity with respect to the plane after 4 seconds.\n\nLet me recall that when an object is dropped from a moving vehicle, like a plane, it has an initial horizontal velocity equal to the plane's velocity, assuming it's released horizontally. So, the payload starts with a horizontal velocity of 100 m/s north.\n\nNow, since the plane is moving north at a constant speed, there's no horizontal acceleration. But vertically, there's the acceleration due to gravity, which is downward at about 9.8 m/s\u00b2.\n\nSo, the payload will have a horizontal component of velocity that remains constant at 100 m/s north, and a vertical component that increases due to gravity.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the velocity relative to the plane. Since the plane is moving north at 100 m/s, and the payload also has that same horizontal velocity, maybe the relative velocity is just the vertical component.\n\nLet me think about that. If both the payload and the plane have the same horizontal velocity, then relative to the plane, the payload's horizontal velocity is zero. So, only the vertical velocity matters.\n\nBut, the payload is falling downward due to gravity, so it has a vertical velocity component downward.\n\nSo, after 4 seconds, the vertical velocity would be:\n\nv_y = g * t = 9.8 m/s\u00b2 * 4 s = 39.2 m/s downward.\n\nSo, relative to the plane, which is moving north at 100 m/s, the payload is moving downward at 39.2 m/s.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 0\n\nB. 40 m/s down\n\nC. 80 m/s down\n\nD. 100 m/s north and 40 m/s down\n\nSo, option B seems closest to my calculation. I got 39.2 m/s down, which is roughly 40 m/s down.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe I missed something.\n\nThe plane is moving north at 100 m/s, and the payload is also moving north at 100 m/s initially. So, horizontally, they are moving together. The only relative motion is vertically downward due to gravity.\n\nSo, yes, the vertical velocity after 4 seconds is indeed v_y = g * t = 9.8 m/s * 4 s = 39.2 m/s down.\n\nOption B says 40 m/s down, which is close enough to 39.2 m/s. Maybe they rounded it up to 40 m/s.\n\nOption D says 100 m/s north and 40 m/s down, but relative to the plane, the horizontal component should be zero, since both the plane and the payload are moving horizontally at the same speed.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is B. 40 m/s down.\n\nWait, but option D includes both components. Maybe it's the absolute velocity, not relative.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for the velocity relative to the plane.\n\nSo, relative to the plane, only the vertical component matters, which is 40 m/s down.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 40 m/s down.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
