                    "text": "Let's tackle this accounting problem. So, Bailey Co. changed from the cash basis to the accrual basis for accounting for insurance expense this year. Last year, in January, they bought a four-year insurance policy for $240,000, and they expensed the whole amount immediately under the cash basis.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the difference between cash basis and accrual basis accounting. In cash basis, expenses are recognized when cash is paid, and revenues are recognized when cash is received. In accrual basis, expenses are recognized when they are incurred, not necessarily when cash is paid, and revenues are recognized when they are earned.\n\nSo, under cash basis, Bailey expensed the entire $240,000 in the prior year when they paid for the insurance. But under accrual basis, since the insurance policy is for four years, the expense should be recognized over those four years because that's when the benefit is being received.\n\nLet me figure out how much expense should be recognized each year under accrual basis. The policy costs $240,000 and covers four years, so annually, the expense should be $240,000 divided by 4, which is $60,000 per year.\n\nNow, since they've already been on cash basis for one year, they've expensed the full $240,000 in the prior year. But under accrual basis, in the prior year, they should have only expensed $60,000, because that's the portion that relates to the first year.\n\nSo, they've over-expensed by $180,000 in the prior year ($240,000 - $60,000). Now, in the current year, they need to correct this overstatement of expense and set up the proper accounting for the remaining years of the insurance policy.\n\nLet's think about the current year. The insurance policy was purchased in January of the prior year, so it's now in its second year. Under accrual basis, they should recognize $60,000 as insurance expense for the current year.\n\nBut since they already expensed the full amount last year, they need to adjust for the remaining unexpired portion of the insurance. The policy lasts four years, so there are three years left at the beginning of the current year.\n\nWait, no. The policy was purchased in January of the prior year, so in the prior year, they should have expensed $60,000, and there are three years left at the beginning of the current year. So, the prepaid insurance asset should reflect the remaining cost of the policy, which is $180,000 ($240,000 - $60,000).\n\nBut wait, under cash basis, they expensed the full $240,000 in the prior year, so they have no prepaid insurance on the books. To switch to accrual basis, they need to recognize the prepaid portion of the insurance as an asset and adjust retained earnings for the overstatement of expense in the prior year.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step.\n\n1. Prior year (under cash basis):\n\n- Expensed $240,000 for the insurance policy.\n\n2. Prior year (under accrual basis):\n\n- Should have expensed $60,000 (1/4 of $240,000).\n\n- Should have had a prepaid insurance asset of $180,000 (remaining 3 years).\n\n3. Current year (switching to accrual basis):\n\n- Need to recognize $60,000 as insurance expense.\n\n- Need to recognize the prepaid portion as an asset.\n\n- Need to adjust retained earnings for the overstatement in the prior year.\n\nSo, to correct the prior year's overstatement of expense, they need to credit retained earnings by $180,000 (the amount over-expensed last year).\n\nAdditionally, they need to record the prepaid portion of the insurance as an asset, which is $180,000.\n\nAnd in the current year, they need to recognize $60,000 as expense.\n\nSo, the journal entry in the current year would be:\n\n- Debit Insurance Expense $60,000\n\n- Debit Prepaid Insurance $180,000\n\n- Credit Retained Earnings $180,000\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, when correcting a prior period error, you would typically adjust the opening balance of retained earnings or the accumulated deficit, as appropriate.\n\nIn this case, since they over-expensed by $180,000 in the prior year, they need to credit retained earnings by $180,000 to correct that overstatement.\n\nSimultaneously, they need to recognize the prepaid portion of the insurance as an asset, which is $180,000.\n\nAnd for the current year, they need to recognize $60,000 as expense.\n\nSo, the entry would be:\n\n- Debit Insurance Expense $60,000\n\n- Debit Prepaid Insurance $180,000\n\n- Credit Retained Earnings $180,000\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them exactly match this. Option C is close but shows a $120,000 debit to prepaid asset and a $60,000 credit to retained earnings, which doesn't align with my calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nThe policy was purchased in January of the prior year for $240,000, covering four years.\n\nUnder cash basis, they expensed the full $240,000 in the prior year.\n\nUnder accrual basis, in the prior year, they should have expensed $60,000 and capitalized $180,000 as prepaid insurance.\n\nSince they didn't do that, they need to correct the prior year's financial statements by adjusting the opening retained earnings for the current year.\n\nSo, to correct the prior year's error:\n\n- Debit Prepaid Insurance $180,000\n\n- Credit Retained Earnings $180,000\n\nThen, for the current year's expense:\n\n- Debit Insurance Expense $60,000\n\n- Credit Prepaid Insurance $60,000\n\nSo, in total:\n\n- Debit Insurance Expense $60,000\n\n- Debit Prepaid Insurance $120,000 (from the $180,000 adjustment minus the $60,000 credited in the current year's expense)\n\n- Credit Retained Earnings $180,000\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should look at it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they need to record the prepaid portion and adjust retained earnings for the overstatement.\n\nLooking back, perhaps the correct entry is:\n\n- Debit Prepaid Insurance $180,000\n\n- Credit Retained Earnings $180,000\n\nThen, for the current year's expense:\n\n- Debit Insurance Expense $60,000\n\n- Credit Prepaid Insurance $60,000\n\nSo, in the current year's financial statements, you would see:\n\n- A debit to Prepaid Insurance of $120,000 (from the $180,000 adjustment minus the $60,000 expensed)\n\n- A debit to Insurance Expense of $60,000\n\n- A credit to Retained Earnings of $180,000\n\nBut none of the options exactly match this. Option C says:\n\n\"As a $60,000 debit to insurance expense, a $120,000 debit to prepaid asset, and $180,000 credit to retained earnings.\"\n\nThis seems to align with my revised thinking.\n\nOption D says:\n\n\"As a $180,000 debit to insurance expense, a $120,000 credit to prepaid asset, and $60,000 credit to retained earnings.\"\n\nThis doesn't make sense because it's debiting insurance expense for $180,000, which is more than the annual expense, and crediting prepaid asset for $120,000, which might be the remaining prepaid portion, but the logic is unclear.\n\nOption A says:\n\n\"As a $180,000 debit to prepaid insurance.\"\n\nThis seems incomplete because it doesn't account for the current year's expense or the adjustment to retained earnings.\n\nOption B says:\n\n\"As a $60,000 debit to insurance expense.\"\n\nThis recognizes the current year's expense but doesn't account for the prepaid portion or the retained earnings adjustment.\n\nTherefore, Option C seems to be the most appropriate choice, as it recognizes the current year's expense, sets up the prepaid asset, and adjusts retained earnings for the prior overstatement.\n\nTo confirm, let's recap:\n\n- Prior year: should have expensed $60,000 and prepaid $180,000.\n\n- But they expensed $240,000.\n\n- So, they need to adjust retained earnings by $180,000 (the overstatement).\n\n- Recognize the prepaid portion as an asset: $180,000.\n\n- Recognize the current year's expense: $60,000.\n\nThus, the entry is:\n\n- Debit Insurance Expense $60,000\n\n- Debit Prepaid Insurance $120,000 (the remaining prepaid portion after recognizing the current year's expense)\n\n- Credit Retained Earnings $180,000\n\nWait, but that doesn't add up. If prepaid insurance is being debited for $120,000 and insurance expense for $60,000, that totals $180,000, which matches the credit to retained earnings.\n\nSo, Option C is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
