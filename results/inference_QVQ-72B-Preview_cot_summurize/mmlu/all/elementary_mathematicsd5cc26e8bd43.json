                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about Gabriella, the Human Cannonball, who did four shows on Saturday, and each show she flew a certain distance. The distances are given: 7.04 meters, 18.81 meters, 18.39 meters, and 19.94 meters. The question is asking for the total distance she flew that day. So, I need to add up all these distances.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the numbers again to keep them organized:\n\n- First show: 7.04 meters\n\n- Second show: 18.81 meters\n\n- Third show: 18.39 meters\n\n- Fourth show: 19.94 meters\n\nNow, I need to add these together. Let's see, adding decimals can be tricky, but if I align them properly, it should be okay.\n\nLet me try adding them step by step.\n\nStart with 7.04 and 18.81.\n\n7.04\n\n+18.81\n\n------\n\n25.85\n\nSo, 7.04 plus 18.81 equals 25.85 meters.\n\nNext, add 18.39 to that.\n\n25.85\n\n+18.39\n\n------\n\n44.24\n\nNow, add the last one, 19.94.\n\n44.24\n\n+19.94\n\n------\n\n64.18\n\nSo, the total distance is 64.18 meters.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 64.18 m\n\nB. 74.18 m\n\nC. 57.14 m\n\nD. 59.24 m\n\nIt seems like option A matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check my addition to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet's try adding them all together again.\n\nStarting with 7.04, plus 18.81.\n\n7.04\n\n+18.81\n\n= 25.85\n\nThat's correct.\n\nThen, 25.85 plus 18.39.\n\n25.85\n\n+18.39\n\n= 44.24\n\nRight.\n\nThen, 44.24 plus 19.94.\n\n44.24\n\n+19.94\n\n= 64.18\n\nYes, that seems accurate.\n\nAlternatively, I could try adding them in a different order to verify.\n\nLet's try adding the largest numbers first: 18.81, 18.39, and 19.94.\n\nFirst, add 18.81 and 18.39.\n\n18.81\n\n+18.39\n\n= 37.20\n\nThen, add 19.94 to that.\n\n37.20\n\n+19.94\n\n= 57.14\n\nNow, add the remaining distance, which is 7.04.\n\n57.14\n\n+7.04\n\n= 64.18\n\nOkay, this matches my previous total of 64.18 meters.\n\nSo, it confirms that the total distance is indeed 64.18 meters.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A. 64.18 m.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any errors in my calculations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 64.18\\ \\text{m}} \\]"
