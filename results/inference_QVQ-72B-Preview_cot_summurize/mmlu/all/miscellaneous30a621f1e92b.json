Hmm, I need to think about this.\n\nFirst off, I know that Amazon is a huge online retailer now, selling all kinds of things from electronics to furniture to groceries. But the question is about when it first started. I remember that Amazon began as an online bookstore. Jeff Bezos, the founder, thought that selling books online would be a great way to tap into a massive market, and books were easy to handle and ship.\n\nLet me double-check that. I think it was in the mid-1990s when Amazon launched. Yeah, 1995 to be precise. And at that time, their sole focus was on books. They didn't sell music, cars, or clothes right away. It was books only.\n\nI recall that the idea was to offer a much larger selection than any brick-and-mortar bookstore could, since online there are no limits on shelf space. So, they started with books to prove the concept of an online retail store.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider each option:\n\nA. Books: As I said, that's what Amazon started with.\n\nB. Compact discs: I think they started selling music CDs a bit later, maybe in the late 1990s.\n\nC. Cars: No, Amazon never sold cars. At least, not in the beginning. Maybe they sell car accessories now, but not entire cars.\n\nD. Clothes: Again, that came later. I think their fashion section expanded significantly over the years, but it wasn't part of their initial offering.\n\nSo, based on my knowledge, the correct answer should be A. Books.\n\nWait a minute, I should make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe I should look it up to confirm. But since this is a thought process exercise, I'll rely on my memory.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the evolution of Amazon's business. They started as an online bookstore and gradually expanded into other categories. So, logically, books were the first and only category when they launched.\n\nJust to add some context, I remember that Bezos chose books because there were so many titles available that no physical store could stock them all. By going online, Amazon could offer a much wider selection, which was a key differentiator.\n\nAlso, the name \"Amazon\" was chosen in reference to the Amazon River, known for its vastness and diversity, which aligned with Bezos' vision for the company.\n\nSo, considering all this, I'm confident that when Amazon first appeared on the Internet, it sold only books.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Books}} \\]"
