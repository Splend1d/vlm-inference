The scenario is that there's a state law that\u7981\u6b62\u5411\u5df2\u5a5a\u4eba\u58eb\u51fa\u552e\u907f\u5b55\u8bbe\u5907\uff0cand a physician is challenging this law in federal court because it prevents him from giving professional advice about contraceptives to three specific married patients whose health could be at risk if they have children.\n\nThe question is whether this physician is likely to have standing to bring this lawsuit. The options are:\n\nA. to have standing.\n\nB. to have standing jus tertii.\n\nC. not to have standing.\n\nD. not to have standing jus tertii.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"standing\" means in a legal context. Standing refers to a party's right or ability to bring a lawsuit in court because they have a sufficient connection to and harm from the law or action they are challenging. So, for the physician to have standing, he needs to show that he's been directly harmed by the statute in some way.\n\nIn this case, the physician is arguing that the statute prevents him from giving professional advice to his patients about the use of contraceptives. So, it seems like his ability to practice medicine as he sees fit is being restricted, which could be a direct harm to him professionally.\n\nBut wait, the statute is about selling contraceptive devices to married persons, not necessarily about giving advice about them. So, maybe the physician isn't being directly harmed in his ability to give advice; perhaps he's just being prevented from selling the devices themselves. But the question says he's challenging the statute because it prevents him from giving professional advice, so maybe there's more to it.\n\nLet me read the scenario again: \"it prevents him from giving professional advice concerning the use of contraceptives to three patients, all of whom are married, whose condition of health might be endangered by child bearing.\"\n\nSo, it's clear that the physician is claiming that the statute is preventing him from giving advice about contraceptive use to these specific patients who are at risk if they have children. That sounds like a direct impact on his practice and his ability to provide care as he sees fit.\n\nNow, \"jus tertii\" refers to the idea that someone is bringing a lawsuit not just for their own rights but for the rights of third parties. In this case, the physician might be trying to assert the rights of his patients to use contraceptives, which would be a jus tertii argument.\n\nBut the question is phrased in a way that suggests the physician is challenging the statute because it affects his ability to give advice, which is a direct harm to him, not necessarily because he's trying to assert his patients' rights.\n\nWait, but the harm is based on his patients' situations, right? He's saying that because of the statute, he can't give advice that's crucial for his patients' health. So, maybe there's an element of jus tertii here because he's relying on his patients' need for the advice to establish his own harm.\n\nI need to recall some case law or principles about standing, especially in the context of medical professionals challenging restrictions that affect their practice.\n\nI remember the case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, where doctors challenged abortion regulations based on how those regulations affected their ability to provide care to their patients. In that case, the Supreme Court allowed doctors to assert the rights of their patients under certain circumstances.\n\nSimilarly, in the context of contraceptive advice, perhaps physicians have standing to challenge restrictions that hinder their ability to provide necessary medical advice to their patients.\n\nBut in more recent cases, like Moore v. Regents of the University of California, the court held that physicians have standing to challenge regulations that affect their professional conduct.\n\nSo, based on that, it seems like the physician in this scenario would have standing because the statute directly affects his ability to practice medicine as he sees fit, particularly in providing advice to his patients.\n\nMoreover, since he's citing specific patients who are at risk, it shows a concrete harm that is likely to be redressed if the statute is struck down.\n\nNow, about the jus tertii part. If the physician is asserting his own rights to practice medicine without undue restriction, that's one thing. But if he's trying to assert his patients' rights to use contraceptives, that's another thing.\n\nIn some cases, physicians are allowed to represent the interests of their patients, especially when the patients might face difficulties in bringing their own lawsuits, like in cases involving sensitive medical information or where the patients are numerous and varied.\n\nBut in this scenario, the physician is specifically mentioning three patients by name, although their names aren't provided. He's identifying that these patients are married and that their health could be endangered by childbearing.\n\nSo, perhaps he's trying to assert both his own rights and his patients' rights. But the way the question is phrased, it seems like his primary argument is based on his own ability to provide advice, which would be a direct harm to him.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A. to have standing.\n\nBut let me consider option B: to have standing jus tertii. This would mean that the physician is primarily trying to assert his patients' rights, rather than his own.\n\nGiven that he's citing his own professional harm in being unable to give advice, it seems like his standing is based more on his own rights as a physician rather than solely on his patients' rights.\n\nOption C: not to have standing. This seems unlikely based on the analysis above, as he appears to have a direct harm from the statute affecting his professional practice.\n\nOption D: not to have standing jus tertii. Again, this would imply that even if he's trying to assert his patients' rights, he doesn't have standing to do so. But given that he's identifying specific patients and a direct impact on his practice, it seems like he would have standing.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I think the best answer is A. to have standing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
