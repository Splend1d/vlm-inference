                    "text": "So I have this question here about detecting breast cancer, and it's asking which method involves exposure to radiation. The options are A: needle aspiration, B: mammography, C: mastectomy, and D: lumpectomy. Hmm, I need to recall what each of these procedures entails.\n\nStarting with needle aspiration, I think that's a method where a needle is used to extract fluid or cells from a lump or cyst in the breast. It's like taking a sample for testing. But does this involve radiation? I don't think so. It seems more of a minimally invasive procedure without the use of radiation.\n\nNext is mammography. I know that mammography is a type of X-ray specifically designed for examining the breast tissue. It's a screening tool to detect tumors or abnormalities. Since it's an X-ray, and X-rays are a form of radiation, I would say that mammography involves exposure to radiation. So, option B seems likely.\n\nThen there's mastectomy. This is a surgical procedure where all or part of the breast is removed, usually to treat breast cancer. It's a pretty major surgery. But does this involve radiation? Well, surgery itself doesn't involve radiation; it's more about cutting and removing tissue. So, I don't think mastectomy directly involves radiation exposure.\n\nLastly, there's lumpectomy. This is another surgical procedure, but unlike mastectomy, it's a less invasive surgery where only the tumor and a small amount of surrounding tissue are removed. It's often followed by radiation therapy, but the procedure itself doesn't involve radiation exposure. So, probably not.\n\nBased on my understanding, mammography is the procedure that involves exposure to radiation. It's important to note that while mammography does involve low levels of radiation, it's a crucial tool for early detection of breast cancer. The benefits generally outweigh the risks, especially when screenings are performed as recommended.\n\nJust to make sure, I should double-check if any of the other procedures indirectly involve radiation. For example, after a lumpectomy, radiation therapy might be recommended, but that's a separate treatment. The lumpectomy procedure itself doesn't involve radiation. Similarly, in a mastectomy, sometimes radiation is part of the overall treatment plan, but again, that's separate from the surgery itself.\n\nNeedle aspiration is primarily for sampling and doesn't involve radiation. It's possible that X-rays or other imaging might be used to guide the needle, but the procedure itself doesn't involve radiation exposure to the patient.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I'm confident that the correct answer is B: mammography. It's the method that directly involves exposure to radiation for detecting breast cancer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
