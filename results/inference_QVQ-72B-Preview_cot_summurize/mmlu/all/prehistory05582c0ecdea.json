                    "text": "So I've got this question here about an ancient Chinese practice of divining the future by examining fired animal bones. The options are:\n\nA. hang-t'u.\n\nB. sarsen divination\n\nC. scapulimancy\n\nD. cylinder seal prophecy\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to find the correct term for this specific practice.\n\nFirst off, I know that divination is a way to seek knowledge of the future or the unknown by supernatural means. So, in this case, it's about predicting the future by looking at fired animal bones.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A is \"hang-t'u.\" I'm not too familiar with this term. Maybe it's a specific type of divination, but I need to see if it relates to firing animal bones.\n\nOption B is \"sarsen divination.\" Sarsens are those big stones found in places like Stonehenge. But I think that's more related to megalithic structures, not necessarily divination involving animal bones. Maybe not the right one.\n\nOption C is \"scapulimancy.\" This sounds a bit like it might be related to bones, because \"scapula\" is a bone in the shoulder. Maybe this is the one? It seems plausible that scapulimancy involves examining bones, possibly animal bones, for omens.\n\nOption D is \"cylinder seal prophecy.\" Cylinder seals were used in ancient Mesopotamia and other places, often for marking clay tablets. While they were used in divination contexts sometimes, I don't think they directly involve firing animal bones.\n\nSo, between these options, C. scapulimancy seems the most likely because it directly refers to the practice of divining from bones, which aligns with the description given in the question.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me do a quick check. I recall that in ancient China, specifically during the Shang dynasty, there was a practice of divination using turtle shells and animal bones, particularly ox scapulas. They would inscribe questions on these bones and shells, then heat them until they cracked, and interpret the cracks to answer their questions.\n\nThis practice is known as oracle bone script or\u7532\u9aa8\u6587 (ji\u01ceg\u01d4w\u00e9n in Chinese), but that's more about the writing on the bones and shells rather than the divination method itself.\n\nLooking back at the options, scapulimancy does seem to fit, as it refers to the practice of divining from scapula bones, which were commonly used in this Chinese divination practice.\n\nHang-t'u, I'm less sure about. It might be another term for this practice, but I don't recall it off the top of my head.\n\nSarsen divination seems off because sarsens are large stones, not animal bones.\n\nCylinder seal prophecy also doesn't seem to fit, as cylinder seals were made of stone or other materials and weren't involved in firing animal bones.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer should be C. scapulimancy.\n\nJust to double-check, I can recall that scapulimancy is indeed the practice of divining from the cracks in heated animal bones, particularly scapulae, which matches the description provided in the question.\n\nSo, I'm confident that C. scapulimancy is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. scapulimancy}} \\]"
