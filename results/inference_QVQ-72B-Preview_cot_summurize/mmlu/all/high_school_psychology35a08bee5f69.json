                    "text": "So the president of this company has brought in an outside consultant specifically to disagree with him on an important decision that's going to be discussed in a meeting with his top executives. The question is, by doing this, what is he trying to avoid?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. The bystander effect\n\nB. Groupthink\n\nC. Social loafing\n\nD. The mere exposure effect\n\nAlright, let's break these down one by one.\n\nFirst, the bystander effect. I remember learning about this in psychology class. It's when people are less likely to help someone in need when there are other people around. Like, if someone's in trouble, and there are lots of people around, everyone assumes someone else will help, so no one helps. But in this scenario, we're talking about a business meeting where the president wants to make sure there's diverse opinion. How does the bystander effect fit in here? Hmm, maybe not directly. Maybe it's not the primary thing he's trying to avoid.\n\nNext, groupthink. I've heard this term before. It's when a group of people come together and their desire for harmony or consensus leads them to avoid critical thinking and not consider alternative viewpoints. This can result in poor decision-making because no one wants to rock the boat. So, in this case, if the president is bringing in someone to disagree with him, maybe he's worried that his executives will just agree with him without really thinking critically about the decision. That sounds like groupthink. So, perhaps he's trying to avoid groupthink by introducing an outside perspective that challenges his own views.\n\nThen, social loafing. I think this is when people put in less effort when they're part of a group because they feel like others will pick up the slack. It's kind of like slacking off when you're in a team. But in this scenario, the president is bringing in someone to disagree with him on a decision, which seems more related to decision-making processes rather than effort put into work. So, maybe social loafing isn't the main issue here.\n\nLastly, the mere exposure effect. I believe this is the idea that people tend to like things better just because they're familiar with them. So, if someone is exposed to something repeatedly, they develop a preference for it, even if they can't explain why. In the context of a business meeting, maybe the president is worried that everyone will automatically prefer his idea just because it's his and they're familiar with his thinking. By bringing in an outside consultant to disagree, he might be trying to counteract that bias towards the familiar option.\n\nSo, let's summarize:\n\nA. Bystander effect: More about helping behavior in emergencies, less relevant here.\n\nB. Groupthink: About consensus-seeking and avoiding dissent, which aligns with bringing in someone to disagree.\n\nC. Social loafing: About reduced effort in group settings, not directly related to decision-making dissent.\n\nD. Mere exposure effect: About preference for familiar things, which might be a factor, but seems secondary to the groupthink concern.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems most likely that the president is trying to avoid groupthink by bringing in an outside consultant to disagree with him. That way, he ensures that there's a diversity of thought and that no one is just going along with his idea without critical evaluation.\n\nSo, my answer would be B. Groupthink.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
