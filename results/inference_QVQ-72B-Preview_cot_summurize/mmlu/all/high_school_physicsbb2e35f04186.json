                    "text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a lab cart moving east. At time t1 = 0.10 s, it's moving at 25 cm/s, and at t2 = 0.20 s, it's moving at 15 cm/s, still east. The question is asking if this information is enough to determine the direction of the net force acting on the cart between t1 and t2. There are four options, and I need to pick the right one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. The cart is moving east, and its speed is decreasing from 25 cm/s to 15 cm/s in 0.10 seconds. So, it's slowing down. I remember that if something is slowing down, the acceleration is in the direction opposite to its motion because something must be opposing its movement.\n\nWait, actually, more precisely, if the cart is slowing down, its acceleration is negative relative to its velocity. Since it's moving east and slowing down, the acceleration is westward.\n\nNow, according to Newton's second law, F = ma, where F is the net force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration. So, the net force should be in the same direction as the acceleration.\n\nBut in this case, the acceleration is westward because the cart is slowing down while moving east. So, the net force should be westward too.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Yes, since we know the cart is slowing down, its momentum change is opposite the direction of movement, and the net force is in the direction of momentum change.\n\nB. No, because we don\u2019t know whether forces such as friction or air resistance might be acting on the cart.\n\nC. No, because we don\u2019t know the mass of the cart.\n\nD. Yes, since we know the cart keeps moving to the east, the net force must be in the direction of motion.\n\nHmm, option A seems to be on the right track. It mentions that the cart is slowing down, so its momentum change is opposite to the direction of movement, and net force is in the direction of momentum change.\n\nWait, but if the cart is slowing down, its momentum is decreasing in the eastward direction, meaning the change in momentum is westward. Therefore, the net force is westward, which is opposite to the direction of motion.\n\nOption D says that the net force must be in the direction of motion, but in this case, since the cart is slowing down, the net force is actually opposite to the motion.\n\nSo, option D is incorrect because it assumes that if the cart is moving east, the net force must also be east, but that's not necessarily true if the cart is slowing down.\n\nOption B says no, because we don't know if there are forces like friction or air resistance acting on the cart. But, actually, the net force is what we're interested in, and even if there are multiple forces acting, their combined effect can be determined from the acceleration.\n\nOption C says no, because we don't know the mass of the cart. But, interestingly, the question is about the direction of the net force, not its magnitude. So, even without knowing the mass, perhaps we can determine the direction based on the change in velocity.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. Newton's second law relates the net force to the mass and acceleration: F = ma. The direction of the net force is the same as the direction of the acceleration.\n\nAcceleration is defined as the change in velocity over time: a = (v_f - v_i)/t.\n\nIn this problem, v_i = 25 cm/s east at t1 = 0.10 s, and v_f = 15 cm/s east at t2 = 0.20 s.\n\nSo, a = (15 cm/s - 25 cm/s)/(0.20 s - 0.10 s) = (-10 cm/s)/0.10 s = -100 cm/s\u00b2.\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the acceleration is in the opposite direction to the initial velocity, which is westward.\n\nTherefore, the net force is westward.\n\nSo, with the given information, we can determine that the net force is westward because the cart is slowing down while moving east.\n\nNow, going back to the options:\n\nA. Yes, since we know the cart is slowing down, its momentum change is opposite the direction of movement, and the net force is in the direction of momentum change.\n\nThis seems correct because when the cart slows down, its momentum decreases in the direction it's moving, so the change in momentum is in the opposite direction, and net force is in the direction of momentum change.\n\nB. No, because we don\u2019t know whether forces such as friction or air resistance might be acting on the cart.\n\nBut, even if there are multiple forces, their net effect can be determined from the acceleration, which we have calculated.\n\nC. No, because we don\u2019t know the mass of the cart.\n\nActually, the direction of the net force doesn't depend on the mass; it depends on the direction of the acceleration.\n\nD. Yes, since we know the cart keeps moving to the east, the net force must be in the direction of motion.\n\nThis is incorrect because, as we've seen, the cart is slowing down, so the net force is opposite to the direction of motion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A.\n\nWait a minute, but option A says \"net force is in the direction of momentum change,\" which is true, but in this specific case, since the cart is slowing down, the momentum change is westward, which is opposite to the direction of motion.\n\nSo, option A is correctly stating that we can determine the direction of the net force based on the momentum change.\n\nOption C is incorrect because, while mass is needed to calculate the magnitude of the force, the direction can be determined without knowing the mass.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because, again, even if there are other forces, their net effect is captured by the acceleration.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the impulse-momentum theorem, which states that the change in momentum of an object is equal to the net force multiplied by the time interval: \u0394p = F_net * t.\n\nIn this case, the initial momentum is p_i = m * 25 cm/s east, and the final momentum is p_f = m * 15 cm/s east.\n\nSo, \u0394p = p_f - p_i = m*(15 - 25) cm/s = m*(-10) cm/s = -10 m cm/s, which is westward.\n\nTherefore, the net force is westward, as F_net = \u0394p / t = (-10 m cm/s)/(0.10 s) = -100 m cm/s\u00b2, which again is westward.\n\nSo, yes, with the given information, we can determine the direction of the net force.\n\nHence, the correct choice is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
