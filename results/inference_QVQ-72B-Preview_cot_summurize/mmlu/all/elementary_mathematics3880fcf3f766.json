                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this phrase: \"3 fewer than a number, p.\" And I need to choose which expression represents that from the options given. The options are:\n\nA. 3 - p\n\nB. p + 3\n\nC. 3 / p\n\nD. p - 3\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what \"3 fewer than a number, p\" means. The word \"fewer\" generally means less than, right? So, \"3 fewer than p\" should mean that we're taking p and subtracting 3 from it.\n\nLet me think about that. If I have a number p and I want 3 fewer than that number, I should subtract 3 from p. So, that would be p - 3.\n\nBut wait, let's consider if the phrase could be interpreted differently. Maybe \"3 fewer than p\" could be understood as p being the larger number and subtracting 3 from it. That still points to p - 3.\n\nOption A is 3 - p, which would be subtracting p from 3, which seems different from what the phrase is suggesting.\n\nOption B is p + 3, which is adding 3 to p, but the phrase says \"fewer than,\" which implies subtraction, not addition.\n\nOption C is 3 / p, which is dividing 3 by p, which doesn't seem to relate directly to the phrase.\n\nOption D is p - 3, which matches my initial thought.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it with some examples.\n\nSuppose p is 10. Then, 3 fewer than 10 would be 10 - 3, which is 7.\n\nIf p is 20, 3 fewer than 20 is 20 - 3, which is 17.\n\nSo, in both cases, it's p minus 3.\n\nNow, let's consider if there's any ambiguity in the phrase. \"3 fewer than a number, p.\" Could it possibly mean something else?\n\nWell, sometimes, phrasing can be tricky, but in this case, it seems straightforward. \"Fewer than\" indicates subtraction, and \"3 fewer than p\" should be p minus 3.\n\nI don't think it's 3 - p because that would mean subtracting p from 3, which would be the opposite.\n\np + 3 would be 3 more than p, not fewer.\n\n3 / p is just division, which doesn't fit the description.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate expression is p - 3.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the order of operations. In algebra, expressions are evaluated from left to right, but in this case, it's just subtraction.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that D. p - 3 is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
