                    "text": "I have this problem about an ant crawling from one point to another and then to a third point, and I need to find out how far it travels in total. The points are (-4,6), the origin (0,0), and then to (4,3). The options are 16, 2\u221a2, 5, and 5 + 2\u221a13. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how to calculate the distance between two points in a coordinate plane. I think the formula is something like the square root of the difference of the x-coordinates squared plus the difference of the y-coordinates squared. Let me write that down.\n\nDistance formula: d = \u221a[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]\n\nOkay, so the ant goes from (-4,6) to (0,0). Let's calculate that distance first.\n\nd1 = \u221a[(0 - (-4))^2 + (0 - 6)^2] = \u221a[(4)^2 + (-6)^2] = \u221a[16 + 36] = \u221a52 = \u221a(4*13) = 2\u221a13\n\nSo, the first leg is 2\u221a13 units.\n\nNext, from the origin (0,0) to (4,3). Let's calculate that distance.\n\nd2 = \u221a[(4 - 0)^2 + (3 - 0)^2] = \u221a[(4)^2 + (3)^2] = \u221a[16 + 9] = \u221a25 = 5\n\nSo, the second leg is 5 units.\n\nFinally, from (-4,6) directly to (4,3). Wait, but the problem says it goes straight from (-4,6) to the origin, and then continues straight to (4,3). So, it's not going directly from (-4,6) to (4,3); it's going via the origin.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should check if going directly from (-4,6) to (4,3) would be shorter or something, but the problem specifies the path: from (-4,6) to (0,0), and then to (4,3).\n\nSo, the total distance is d1 + d2 = 2\u221a13 + 5.\n\nLooking at the options, I see 5 + 2\u221a13, which is option D.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's any other way to interpret the problem. Is there a possibility that the path is along a straight line that passes through all three points? Let's see if they are collinear.\n\nTo check if three points are collinear, I can calculate the slopes between them.\n\nSlope between (-4,6) and (0,0): m1 = (0 - 6)/(0 - (-4)) = -6/4 = -3/2\n\nSlope between (0,0) and (4,3): m2 = (3 - 0)/(4 - 0) = 3/4\n\nSince m1 \u2260 m2, the points are not collinear. So, the path is indeed two straight lines that don't form a straight line together.\n\nTherefore, the total distance is 5 + 2\u221a13.\n\nI think the answer is D. 5 + 2\u221a13.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5 + 2\\sqrt{13}} \\]"
