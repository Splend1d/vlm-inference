                    "text": "So I've got this situation here where a salesman who's been working for 20 years at a company gets fired unexpectedly. He thinks it's because of age discrimination and decides to sue the company. During the trial, he wants to call a company employee to testify against the company. This employee was supposedly at a board meeting where the company's president said something like, \"Everyone agrees the salesman is too old and doesn't fit the image we want our employees to project.\"\n\nNow, the company usually records these board meetings on tape, and it's customary for the secretary to transcribe those tapes afterward. The company's lawyer is objecting to this employee's testimony. The question is, will the employee's proposed testimony be admissible or inadmissible, and why?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Admissible, because the employee was present during the board meeting.\n\nB. Admissible, because the president's statement was an admission by a company representative.\n\nC. Inadmissible, because the tape of the meeting is the best evidence.\n\nD. Inadmissible, because the secretary's transcribed notes are the best evidence.\n\nOkay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, the employee was present at the meeting, so she heard the president make this statement. Normally, if someone is a witness to an event, their testimony about what they saw or heard is admissible. So, option A suggests that her testimony is admissible because she was there.\n\nOption B says it's admissible because the president's statement was an admission by a company representative. Well, the president is likely considered a high-level representative of the company, and his statements could be admissions against the company's interest, which can be used as evidence. So, that also seems like a good reason to allow the testimony.\n\nThen, options C and D suggest that the testimony is inadmissible because there are better forms of evidence available: the tape recording or the transcribed notes from the secretary.\n\nHmm, that brings up the Best Evidence Rule. I think the Best Evidence Rule applies when there's a requirement for original documents or recordings to prove the content of what was said, especially in written communications like contracts or letters.\n\nIn this case, we have a tape recording and transcribed notes from a board meeting. So, if the content of the president's statement is crucial, might the court prefer the original tape recording or the transcribed notes over the employee's recollection?\n\nLet me consider that. The employee's testimony is secondhand; it's her recollection of what was said. The tape recording is the actual record of what was said, and the transcribed notes are a written version of that recording.\n\nGenerally, the original recording would be the best evidence because it's the most accurate record of what was said. The transcribed notes might also be considered a reliable record, assuming they're accurate.\n\nSo, if the tape recording exists and can be produced, it might be that the court would prefer that over the employee's testimony. Similarly, if the transcribed notes are available and accurate, they might be preferred.\n\nBut, in some cases, witness testimony can still be admissible, especially if the witness is testifying about something that isn't fully captured by the documents or recordings, or if the recordings are not available for some reason.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, it seems that both the tape recording and the transcribed notes are available and are part of the company's standard practice.\n\nSo, perhaps the court would rule that the employee's testimony is inadmissible because the tape recording or the transcribed notes are the best evidence of what was said during the meeting.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the Best Evidence Rule more carefully. The Best Evidence Rule typically applies to the contents of writings, signings, or recordings when their terms are at issue. It requires that the original document or recording be produced to prove its content.\n\nIn this case, the president's statement is the key piece of evidence, and it was recorded on tape and transcribed.\n\nSo, if the tape recording is available, it would be the best evidence of what was said. If the tape is not available, then the transcribed notes might suffice, provided they are accurate and reliable.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the employee's testimony is inadmissible because the tape recording is the best evidence.\n\nBut, on the other hand, the employee was present and heard the statement firsthand. Her testimony could be considered direct evidence of the president's statement.\n\nMaybe the court would allow her testimony but give it less weight because there's a more reliable record available.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tape recording or the transcribed notes would be entered into evidence, and the employee's testimony would be supplementary.\n\nWait a minute, maybe both the tape recording and the employee's testimony are admissible, but the tape recording would be given more weight because it's the actual record.\n\nBut the question is whether the employee's testimony will be held admissible or inadmissible upon objection by the company's attorney.\n\nGiven that, and considering that there's a better form of evidence available (the tape recording), the court might rule that the employee's testimony is inadmissible under the Best Evidence Rule.\n\nSo, between options C and D, which one is more accurate?\n\nOption C says it's inadmissible because the tape of the meeting is the best evidence.\n\nOption D says it's inadmissible because the secretary's transcribed notes are the best evidence.\n\nWell, both are true, but the tape recording is likely considered the original and therefore the best evidence, while the transcribed notes are a derivative of the tape.\n\nSo, perhaps option C is more precise, as the tape recording is the original recording of the event.\n\nBut, to be thorough, sometimes transcribed notes are also considered reliable records, especially if they were prepared in the ordinary course of business and are accurate.\n\nHowever, generally, the original recording would be preferred over a transcription.\n\nSo, I think option C is the most accurate answer: the employee's testimony will be held inadmissible because the tape of the meeting is the best evidence.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider if there are any exceptions or other rules that might apply here.\n\nFor example, is the employee's testimony being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, or is it being offered for another purpose, like to show the effect on the listener or something else?\n\nIf it's being offered to prove what the president said, then yes, the Best Evidence Rule would apply, and the tape recording would be the best evidence.\n\nAlternatively, if the employee's testimony is being offered to authenticate the tape recording or the transcribed notes, then it might be admissible for that purpose.\n\nBut the question seems to suggest that the employee's testimony is being offered to prove what was said in the meeting, which is directly contradicted by the existence of the tape recording and transcribed notes.\n\nTherefore, it's reasonable to conclude that the employee's testimony will be held inadmissible because the tape of the meeting is the best evidence.\n\nSo, my answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
