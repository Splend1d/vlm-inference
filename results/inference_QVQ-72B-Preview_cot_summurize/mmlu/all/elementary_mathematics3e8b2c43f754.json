                    "text": "So I have this expression: 5(6x + 3y), and I need to find out which of these options is equivalent to it. The options are:\n\nA. 11x + 3y\n\nB. 11x + 8y\n\nC. 30x + 3y\n\nD. 30x + 15y\n\nHmm, I think I need to distribute the 5 into the parentheses. So, 5 times 6x and 5 times 3y.\n\nFirst, 5 times 6x is 30x. Then, 5 times 3y is 15y. So, it should be 30x + 15y.\n\nLet me double-check that. Distribution property says that a(b + c) = ab + ac. So, 5*6x = 30x and 5*3y = 15y. Adding them up gives 30x + 15y.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 11x + 3y\n\nB. 11x + 8y\n\nC. 30x + 3y\n\nD. 30x + 15y\n\nSo, option D seems to match what I got.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any other way to interpret this. Is there any possibility of combining like terms or anything else that might change the expression?\n\nWell, 6x and 3y are not like terms, so I can't combine them. And there's no other operation inside the parentheses that would change their values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the associative property or something, but I don't think that's necessary here.\n\nLet me try another approach. Suppose I have 5 times the quantity (6x + 3y). That should be the same as 5 multiplied by 6x plus 5 multiplied by 3y.\n\nSo, 5*6x = 30x, and 5*3y = 15y. Adding those together gives 30x + 15y.\n\nYeah, that matches option D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any misstep here.\n\nIs there a chance that the distribution might not apply in this case? No, because distribution applies to multiplication over addition, which is exactly what's happening here.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to think about the order of operations. First, you handle the parentheses, but since there's only multiplication and addition inside, you can distribute the outside multiplier directly to each term inside.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to plug in some values for x and y, maybe I could test the equivalence.\n\nLet's say x = 1 and y = 2.\n\nThen, 5(6*(1) + 3*(2)) = 5(6 + 6) = 5(12) = 60.\n\nNow, plugging x = 1 and y = 2 into each option:\n\nA. 11*(1) + 3*(2) = 11 + 6 = 17\n\nB. 11*(1) + 8*(2) = 11 + 16 = 27\n\nC. 30*(1) + 3*(2) = 30 + 6 = 36\n\nD. 30*(1) + 15*(2) = 30 + 30 = 60\n\nSo, only option D gives the same value as the original expression when x=1 and y=2.\n\nThis reinforces that option D is the correct choice.\n\nI think I've covered a few different ways to confirm that the correct answer is option D. It's always good to approach a problem from multiple angles to ensure understanding.\n\nSo, the expression equivalent to 5(6x + 3y) is 30x + 15y.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
