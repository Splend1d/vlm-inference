                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem about a heat pump. It says that the heat pump is extracting heat from an outdoor environment at 7\u00b0C and heating the indoor environment to 27\u00b0C. For every 15,000 joules of heat delivered indoors, I need to find the smallest amount of work that must be supplied to the heat pump. The options are 500 J, 1,000 J, 1,100 J, and 2,000 J.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall how a heat pump works. A heat pump is like a refrigerator but in reverse. It takes heat from a cold source (outdoors) and transfers it to a warmer destination (indoors), using some work input to make this happen.\n\nI remember that the efficiency of a heat pump is measured by something called the coefficient of performance (COP). For a heat pump, COP is defined as the heat delivered (Q_h) divided by the work input (W). So, COP = Q_h / W.\n\nBut wait, there's also a thermal efficiency for heat engines, but this is a heat pump, so COP is the right one to use here.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the smallest amount of work that must be supplied. That sounds like we're dealing with the most efficient heat pump possible, which would be a reversible one, right? Because reversible processes are the most efficient.\n\nSo, for a reversible heat pump, the COP is given by the formula: COP = T_h / (T_h - T_c), where T_h is the temperature of the hot reservoir and T_c is the temperature of the cold reservoir.\n\nBut wait, in some texts, T_h is the higher temperature and T_c is the lower temperature. I need to make sure I have the signs correct.\n\nLet me look this up. Yes, for a heat pump, the COP is indeed COP = T_h / (T_h - T_c), where T_h is the temperature of the hot reservoir and T_c is the temperature of the cold reservoir.\n\nGiven that, I have T_c = 7\u00b0C, which is 280.15 K (since 7 + 273.15 = 280.15), and T_h = 27\u00b0C, which is 300.15 K.\n\nSo, COP = 300.15 / (300.15 - 280.15) = 300.15 / 20.00 = 15.0075.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says that for each 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors, the smallest amount of work that must be supplied is approximately...\n\nSo, if COP = Q_h / W, then W = Q_h / COP.\n\nTherefore, W = 15,000 J / 15.0075.\n\nLet me calculate that: 15,000 divided by 15.0075.\n\nFirst, 15,000 divided by 15 is 1,000 J.\n\nBut since the COP is slightly more than 15, the actual work required would be slightly less than 1,000 J.\n\nBut looking back, the temperatures I used were 280.15 K and 300.15 K. Maybe I should use exact temperatures.\n\nLet me recalculate COP with more decimal places.\n\nCOP = T_h / (T_h - T_c) = 300.15 / (300.15 - 280.15) = 300.15 / 20.00 = 15.0075.\n\nSo, W = 15,000 / 15.0075.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, 15,000 / 15 = 1,000.\n\nThen, 15,000 / 0.0075 = let's see, 15,000 divided by 0.0075.\n\nWell, 15,000 divided by 0.0075 is the same as 15,000 multiplied by 1000 divided by 7.5, which is 15,000,000 / 7.5 = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, total W = 1,000 - 2,000,000? Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, I think I messed up the decimal places.\n\nLet me try again.\n\n15,000 divided by 15.0075.\n\nFirst, 15,000 divided by 15 is 1,000.\n\nNow, the difference comes from the 0.0075 part.\n\nSo, 15,000 divided by 0.0075.\n\nWait, no, more precisely, it's 15,000 divided by 15.0075.\n\nLet me use a calculator for this.\n\nBut since I don't have one, I'll have to estimate.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula W = Q_h / COP.\n\nGiven that COP is approximately 15, and Q_h is 15,000 J, then W \u2248 1,000 J.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the smallest amount of work, which would correspond to the reversible case, which is the most efficient.\n\nSo, W = 15,000 / 15.0075.\n\nLet me approximate this.\n\nSince 15.0075 is very close to 15, I can write W \u2248 15,000 / 15 - 15,000 * (0.0075 / 15^2).\n\nWait, that's using a Taylor expansion.\n\nBut maybe it's simpler to just calculate 15,000 divided by 15.0075 directly.\n\nLet me assume that 15,000 / 15.0075 is roughly 999.5 J or so, but since the options are in whole numbers, it might be 1,000 J.\n\nBut looking back at the options, 1,000 J is one of them, so maybe that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to consider more precise calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics states that the work input W is equal to the heat delivered Q_h minus the heat extracted Q_c, or W = Q_h - Q_c.\n\nBut in this problem, Q_h is given as 15,000 J, and T_h is 300.15 K, T_c is 280.15 K.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula W = Q_h * (1 - T_c / T_h).\n\nWait, that's for a heat engine, not a heat pump.\n\nFor a heat pump, it's different.\n\nWait, no, for a heat engine, W = Q_h - Q_c, and efficiency \u03b7 = W / Q_h = (T_h - T_c) / T_h.\n\nBut for a heat pump, COP = Q_h / W = T_h / (T_h - T_c).\n\nSo, using COP = T_h / (T_h - T_c), and W = Q_h / COP, as I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the formula W = Q_h * (T_h - T_c) / T_h.\n\nWait, that seems similar.\n\nLet me see:\n\nW = Q_h * (T_h - T_c) / T_h.\n\nGiven that, W = 15,000 * (300.15 - 280.15) / 300.15 = 15,000 * 20.00 / 300.15.\n\nCalculating that: 20.00 / 300.15 \u2248 0.0666, so 15,000 * 0.0666 \u2248 1,000 J.\n\nSo, again, I get approximately 1,000 J.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 1,000 J seems to be the closest answer.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's a more precise calculation.\n\nUsing COP = T_h / (T_h - T_c) = 300.15 / 20.00 = 15.0075.\n\nThen, W = Q_h / COP = 15,000 / 15.0075.\n\nCalculating that: 15,000 divided by 15 is 1,000, and then 15,000 divided by 0.0075 is 2,000,000, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, no, 15,000 / 15.0075.\n\nLet me calculate 15,000 divided by 15.0075.\n\nFirst, 15,000 / 15 = 1,000.\n\nNow, the correction term is 15,000 * (0.0075 / 15.0075^2).\n\nBut this seems too complicated without a calculator.\n\nAlternatively, I can approximate that the work is roughly 1,000 J, given the close proximity to 15.0075 being 15.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options provided, I think the answer is B. 1,000 J.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
