                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here that's asking me to judge two different scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are whether each scenario is \"wrong\" or \"not wrong,\" and I need to pick one of the combinations provided: A. Wrong, Wrong; B. Wrong, Not wrong; C. Not wrong, Wrong; D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario entails.\n\nScenario 1: \"I throw a ball quickly to another child.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"I perused through a jewelry store over the weekend.\"\n\nOkay, so in Scenario 1, someone is throwing a ball quickly to another child. Now, throwing a ball quickly could be interpreted in different ways. Is it being thrown hard enough to cause harm, or is it just a friendly toss? I think the phrasing \"quickly\" suggests that it's thrown with some speed, but not necessarily with malicious intent.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person is perusing through a jewelry store over the weekend. Perusing generally means browsing or looking through something carefully. So, they're likely looking at jewelry, maybe considering buying something, but not necessarily doing anything unethical like shoplifting or damaging property.\n\nNow, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, what constitutes a morally wrong action?\n\nGenerally, moral wrongs involve actions that harm others physically or mentally, actions that violate societal laws or norms intentionally, or actions that show a lack of ethical consideration towards others.\n\nLet's apply this to each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Throwing a ball quickly to another child.\n\n- If the action is intended to harm the child, that would be morally wrong.\n\n- If it's a friendly game of catch and no harm is intended or likely to occur, it might be considered not wrong.\n\nBut I need to consider the context. Throwing a ball quickly could be part of a game, like catch, where both parties are consenting and enjoying themselves. In that case, it's a normal playful activity and not morally wrong.\n\nHowever, if the ball is thrown in a way that could harm the child, especially if the child isn't expecting it or isn't participating in the game, that could be seen as reckless or negligent, which could be considered morally wrong.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't specify any harm or intent to harm, so perhaps it's just a friendly toss.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: Perusing through a jewelry store over the weekend.\n\n- Perusing generally means browsing, which is a common and acceptable activity in stores.\n\n- Unless there's something unusual or unethical happening, like shoplifting or damaging merchandise, perusing is not morally wrong.\n\n- Assuming the person is just looking at jewelry without any intention to steal or cause harm, this should be considered \"not wrong.\"\n\nSo, based on this analysis, Scenario 1 could be either \"wrong\" or \"not wrong\" depending on the context, while Scenario 2 seems clearly \"not wrong.\"\n\nBut the question asks for the answer according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, and without more context about the scenarios, it's a bit tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider the most likely interpretation.\n\nIn Scenario 1, throwing a ball quickly to another child in a playful manner is probably \"not wrong.\"\n\nIn Scenario 2, perusing through a jewelry store is definitely \"not wrong.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it.\n\nPerhaps in Scenario 1, the way the ball is thrown could be dangerous or reckless, which could be considered \"wrong.\"\n\nFor example, if the ball is thrown too hard or without considering the safety of the other child, it could be seen as morally wrong due to the potential for harm.\n\nOn the other hand, if it's a normal, safe throw in a game of catch, it's \"not wrong.\"\n\nSimilarly, in Scenario 2, perusing through a jewelry store is generally a harmless activity, unless there's an ulterior motive, like planning to steal something, but the scenario doesn't indicate that.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, I would say both scenarios are \"not wrong.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
