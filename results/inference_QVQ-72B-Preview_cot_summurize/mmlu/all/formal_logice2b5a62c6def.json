                    "text": "Alright, I've got this logic problem here. It says: \"The university raises tuition if, and only if, both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\" And I need to identify the antecedent of this conditional proposition. The options are:\n\nA. The university raises tuition.\n\nB. The governor approves of it.\n\nC. The board of trustees recommends it.\n\nD. None of the above.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what a conditional proposition is and what an antecedent is. A conditional proposition is usually of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent. So, I need to figure out which part of this statement is the \"if\" part and which is the \"then\" part.\n\nThe statement says: \"The university raises tuition if, and only if, both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\"\n\nHmm, it's a bit tricky because of the \"if, and only if\" part. I know that \"if, and only if\" means that both directions of the conditional are true. So, it's not just \"if P, then Q,\" but also \"if Q, then P.\" In other words, it's a biconditional statement, like P if and only if Q, which is P \u2194 Q.\n\nSo, in this case, the statement is: \"The university raises tuition if, and only if, both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\"\n\nLet me try to break this down. The phrase \"if, and only if\" is connecting \"the university raises tuition\" with \"both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\"\n\nSo, it seems like \"the university raises tuition\" is being connected with the conjunction of \"the governor approves of it\" and \"the board of trustees recommends it.\"\n\nWait a minute, in symbolic logic, \"if, and only if\" represents a biconditional, meaning that P \u2194 Q is equivalent to (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (Q \u2192 P).\n\nSo, in this statement, \"the university raises tuition\" is related to \"both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it\" via \"if, and only if,\" which means that both \"the university raises tuition\" if \"both the governor approves and the board recommends\" and \"both the governor approves and the board recommends\" if \"the university raises tuition.\"\n\nBut, to identify the antecedent of the conditional proposition, I need to find which part is the \"if\" part and which is the \"then\" part.\n\nLet me consider the first part: \"The university raises tuition if, and only if, both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\"\n\nThis can be rephrased as: \"The university raises tuition if both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it,\" and also, \"if the university raises tuition, then both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\"\n\nSo, it's a biconditional: (the university raises tuition) \u2194 (both the governor approves and the board recommends).\n\nNow, in a biconditional, there are two conditionals: one in each direction.\n\nBut the question is asking for the antecedent of the conditional proposition. Since it's a biconditional, there are actually two conditionals here, each with their own antecedent and consequent.\n\nBut perhaps the question is referring to one specific conditional within this statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire statement is being considered as a single conditional.\n\nWait, let's look at the options again:\n\nA. The university raises tuition.\n\nB. The governor approves of it.\n\nC. The board of trustees recommends it.\n\nD. None of the above.\n\nGiven that the statement is a biconditional, involving both \"if\" directions, it might not have a single antecedent in the traditional sense. But perhaps the question is expecting me to identify one part as the primary antecedent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to one specific conditional within the biconditional.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose I let P be \"the university raises tuition,\" Q be \"the governor approves,\" and R be \"the board of trustees recommends.\"\n\nThen the statement is: P if and only if (Q and R).\n\nSo, P \u2194 (Q \u2227 R).\n\nNow, in the conditional P \u2194 (Q \u2227 R), what is the antecedent?\n\nIn a biconditional, it's not straightforward to identify an antecedent because a biconditional is equivalent to two conditionals.\n\nBut perhaps the question is referring to one of the conditionals within it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the antecedent is (Q \u2227 R), since P is true if and only if both Q and R are true.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option A is \"the university raises tuition,\" which corresponds to P.\n\nOption B is \"the governor approves of it,\" which is Q.\n\nOption C is \"the board of trustees recommends it,\" which is R.\n\nOption D is \"none of the above.\"\n\nGiven that the statement is P \u2194 (Q \u2227 R), I need to determine which part is the antecedent.\n\nIn the conditional P \u2194 (Q \u2227 R), it's a biconditional, so it's not a simple \"if P then Q\" form.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire (Q \u2227 R) is the antecedent in one direction, and P is the antecedent in the other direction.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the definition of \"antecedent\" in a conditional statement.\n\nIn a standard conditional \"if P then Q,\" P is the antecedent, and Q is the consequent.\n\nIn a biconditional P \u2194 Q, there are two conditionals: P \u2192 Q and Q \u2192 P.\n\nSo, in this case, P \u2194 (Q \u2227 R) is equivalent to [P \u2192 (Q \u2227 R)] \u2227 [(Q \u2227 R) \u2192 P].\n\nTherefore, there are two conditionals here:\n\n1. P \u2192 (Q \u2227 R)\n\n2. (Q \u2227 R) \u2192 P\n\nSo, in the first conditional, P is the antecedent, and (Q \u2227 R) is the consequent.\n\nIn the second conditional, (Q \u2227 R) is the antecedent, and P is the consequent.\n\nBut the question is asking for the antecedent of the conditional proposition, which is the entire statement: \"The university raises tuition if, and only if, both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\"\n\nThis seems to be a biconditional, as I said, involving both P \u2192 (Q \u2227 R) and (Q \u2227 R) \u2192 P.\n\nBut perhaps the question is referring to the primary conditional in the statement.\n\nGiven that, maybe the antecedent is P, which is \"the university raises tuition.\"\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because typically, in a biconditional, both directions have their own antecedents and consequents.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire statement doesn't have a single antecedent, but since the question insists on choosing one, perhaps it's expecting me to choose P as the antecedent.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is \"the university raises tuition.\"\n\nOption B is \"the governor approves of it.\"\n\nOption C is \"the board of trustees recommends it.\"\n\nOption D is \"none of the above.\"\n\nGiven that, and considering the biconditional nature of the statement, I think the antecedent of the conditional proposition is \"the university raises tuition,\" which is option A.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because of the biconditional aspect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the antecedent is the conjunction \"both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it,\" which is (Q \u2227 R).\n\nBut that's not one of the options provided.\n\nOption B is just \"the governor approves of it,\" which is Q.\n\nOption C is just \"the board of trustees recommends it,\" which is R.\n\nNeither of these is the entire conjunction.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the antecedent is \"the university raises tuition,\" which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the biconditional as two separate conditionals, then in one direction, \"the university raises tuition\" is the antecedent, and in the other direction, \"both the governor approves and the board recommends\" is the antecedent.\n\nBut since the question specifies \"the antecedent of the conditional proposition,\" and given the options, I think option A is the correct choice.\n\nSo, my final answer is option A: the university raises tuition.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
