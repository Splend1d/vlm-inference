                    "text": "So I need to find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) over Q. That means I need to find [Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) : Q], which is the dimension of Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) as a vector space over Q.\n\nFirst, I should understand what Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) is. It's the smallest field containing both Q and sqrt(2)*sqrt(3), which is the same as Q adjoined with sqrt(2)*sqrt(3). So, Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) = Q(sqrt(6)).\n\nNow, to find the degree of this extension, I can use the tower law or directly find the minimal polynomial of sqrt(6) over Q.\n\nWait, but sqrt(6) is a root of the polynomial x^2 - 6 over Q. Let me check if this polynomial is irreducible over Q. If it is, then [Q(sqrt(6)) : Q] = 2.\n\nTo check if x^2 - 6 is irreducible over Q, I can use the rational roots theorem. The possible rational roots are \u00b11 and \u00b16, and none of these are roots of x^2 - 6 = 0, since sqrt(6) is not a rational number. Therefore, x^2 - 6 is irreducible over Q, and [Q(sqrt(6)) : Q] = 2.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could consider the degrees step by step.\n\nI know that Q \u2286 Q(sqrt(2)) \u2286 Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), and similarly, Q \u2286 Q(sqrt(3)) \u2286 Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)). But here, I only have Q(sqrt(6)), which is Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, but sqrt(6) is sqrt(2)*sqrt(3), so Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) is the same as Q containing sqrt(2) and sqrt(3), since sqrt(2)*sqrt(3) is in Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), and vice versa.\n\nBut no, that's not necessarily true. If I have Q(sqrt(6)), can I get sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) from it?\n\nLet me see: suppose I have sqrt(6) in the field. Can I express sqrt(2) or sqrt(3) in terms of sqrt(6)?\n\nHmm, maybe not directly. So perhaps Q(sqrt(6)) is not the same as Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider the minimal polynomial of sqrt(6) over Q.\n\nWe have that sqrt(6) is a root of x^2 - 6, and since this polynomial is irreducible over Q, as I checked earlier, then [Q(sqrt(6)) : Q] = 2.\n\nSo, the degree should be 2.\n\nBut wait, let's see if there's a possibility of a smaller degree. If x^2 - 6 factors over Q, but it doesn't, as I already determined.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a lower-degree polynomial that sqrt(6) satisfies. But no, since sqrt(6) is not rational, and x - sqrt(6) is not in Q[x], the minimal polynomial must be of degree at least 2.\n\nSo, [Q(sqrt(6)) : Q] = 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 2.\n\nI think that's it. Maybe to be extra sure, I can consider another approach.\n\nLet me consider the basis of Q(sqrt(6)) over Q. A basis is {1, sqrt(6)}, since any element in Q(sqrt(6)) can be written as a + b*sqrt(6), where a and b are in Q.\n\nSo, the dimension is 2, which again confirms that the degree is 2.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now that the answer is C. 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
