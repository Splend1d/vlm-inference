Jainism has different sects, and one of them is called Svetambara. So, it's a sect within Jainism, but the question is asking about the meaning of the term itself, not about the sect per se.\n\nLet me think about the etymology of the word. \"Svetambara\" sounds like it's derived from Sanskrit, which is the classical language of India. Sanskrit is known for its rich vocabulary and complex grammar, so breaking down the word might help.\n\nLooking at the options, they all relate to clothing or the lack thereof, which makes sense because Jainism is known for its ascetic practices, and many Jain monks practice varying degrees of nudity as a sign of renunciation.\n\nOption A is \"Sky-clad,\" which sounds poetic and might refer to wearing nothing but the sky, essentially being naked. Option B is \"Naked,\" which is straightforward. Option C is \"White-clad,\" suggesting wearing white clothing, and Option D is \"Clothed,\" which could mean wearing any kind of clothing.\n\nI need to match \"Svetambara\" with the correct meaning among these options.\n\nLet me consider the context. In Jainism, there are two main sects: Svetambara and Digambara. The Digambara monks are known for practicing strict nudity, often referred to as \"sky-clad\" or \"wearers of the sky.\" So, if Svetambara means \"white-clad,\" that would distinguish them from the Digambaras, who are naked.\n\nWait a minute, I think I recall that Svetambara monks do wear white robes, unlike their Digambara counterparts who are naked. So, if that's the case, then \"Svetambara\" would mean \"white-clad,\" which aligns with Option C.\n\nBut let me double-check. I remember that in Jainism, the monks and nuns follow different practices regarding clothing. The Svetambara monks wear white robes as a symbol of purity and renunciation, whereas the Digambara monks believe in complete renunciation of clothing.\n\nSo, based on this, \"Svetambara\" should mean \"white-clad,\" which is Option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options. \"Sky-clad\" is often used to describe Digambara monks, who do not wear any clothing and consider the sky as their only covering. \"Naked\" would also refer to the same practice. \"Clothed\" is too general and doesn't specify the color or type of clothing.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate meaning of \"Svetambara\" is \"white-clad,\" which corresponds to Option C.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
