The options are:\n\nA. brain, spinal cord, cranial nerves\n\nB. cranial nerves, spinal nerves, autonomic ganglia\n\nC. spinal cord, spinal nerves, sense organs\n\nD. medulla, pons, thalamus\n\nI remember that the nervous system is divided into the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord, right? So, anything besides those should be part of the PNS.\n\nLet's look at option A: brain, spinal cord, cranial nerves. Since brain and spinal cord are part of the CNS, this can't be the correct choice for PNS.\n\nOption B: cranial nerves, spinal nerves, autonomic ganglia. Cranial and spinal nerves sound like they're connected to the PNS, and autonomic ganglia are part of the autonomic nervous system, which is a subset of the PNS. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption C: spinal cord, spinal nerves, sense organs. Spinal cord is part of the CNS, so this can't be the right answer.\n\nOption D: medulla, pons, thalamus. I think these are all parts of the brain, which is part of the CNS.\n\nSo, based on this, option B seems to be the correct choice. But just to make sure, let's recall what the peripheral nervous system actually includes.\n\nThe peripheral nervous system consists of all the neural elements that lie outside the central nervous system. It includes:\n\n1. Cranial nerves: These are 12 paired nerves originating from the brain that innervate various parts of the head, neck, and sometimes the trunk.\n\n2. Spinal nerves: These are 31 paired nerves that branch off from the spinal cord and innervate the rest of the body.\n\n3. Autonomic ganglia: These are clusters of neurons that are part of the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions like heart rate and digestion.\n\nSo, cranial nerves, spinal nerves, and autonomic ganglia are all components of the peripheral nervous system.\n\nOption B lists exactly these components: cranial nerves, spinal nerves, and autonomic ganglia.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if any other options partially include parts of the PNS.\n\nOption C mentions sense organs. While sense organs do receive sensory information, they are not directly part of the peripheral nervous system. The sensory neurons that transmit information from the sense organs to the CNS are part of the PNS, but the sense organs themselves are considered part of the effector organs or receptors.\n\nOption D includes medulla, pons, and thalamus, which are all parts of the brain and thus part of the CNS.\n\nTherefore, the only fully accurate description of the peripheral nervous system among the given options is option B: cranial nerves, spinal nerves, autonomic ganglia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
