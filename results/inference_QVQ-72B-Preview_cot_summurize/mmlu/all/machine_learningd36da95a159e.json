                    "text": "So I'm working on this linear regression model, and I've noticed that it's overfitting the data. That means the model is performing really well on the training data but not so great on new, unseen data. To tackle this issue, I decided to add L2 regularization. L2 regularization is a technique that penalizes the magnitude of the weights in the model to prevent overfitting. It does this by adding a term to the loss function that's proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights.\n\nNow, as I increase the L2 regularization coefficient, I need to understand what's going to happen to the bias and variance of my model. Bias refers to the error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm, while variance refers to the error due to the model's sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data.\n\nOption A says that both bias and variance will increase. But I don't think that's correct because regularization is supposed to reduce variance by making the model less complex.\n\nOption B suggests that bias will increase and variance will decrease. This seems plausible because by adding regularization, I'm making the model simpler, which could increase bias but decrease variance.\n\nOption C says bias will decrease and variance will increase. That doesn't align with my understanding because regularization is meant to reduce overfitting, which is high variance, not increase it.\n\nOption D proposes that both bias and variance will decrease. But I recall that there's a trade-off between bias and variance, so it's unlikely that both would decrease simultaneously.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. In linear regression without regularization, the model tries to fit the data as closely as possible, which can lead to overfitting if the model is too complex relative to the data. By adding L2 regularization, we're penalizing large weights, which effectively makes the model less complex. This should lead to a decrease in variance because the model is less sensitive to fluctuations in the training data.\n\nHowever, making the model less complex also means that it might not capture all the underlying patterns in the data as well, which could increase the bias. So, in this trade-off, increasing regularization should lead to higher bias and lower variance.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look at it in terms of the bias-variance decomposition of the mean squared error. The mean squared error can be decomposed into bias squared, variance, and irreducible error. Regularization affects the bias and variance terms.\n\nIn the context of linear regression, the weights are estimated as \u03b2_hat = (X^T X + \u03bb I)^-1 X^T y, where \u03bb is the regularization parameter. As \u03bb increases, the weights become smaller, making the model simpler. This simplicity reduces variance because the model is less likely to capture noise in the training data. However, this simplicity might also mean that the model doesn't capture all the true relationships in the data, leading to increased bias.\n\nSo, in this scenario, as \u03bb increases, bias increases and variance decreases. That points to option B.\n\nBut let me consider another perspective. Maybe there's a sweet spot where both bias and variance are minimized, and increasing regularization beyond that point could cause both to increase. However, in practice, with proper tuning of the regularization parameter, we aim to find a balance where the model has acceptable bias and variance.\n\nStill, based on the theory, I think that as \u03bb increases, bias increases and variance decreases. So, the answer should be option B: bias increase; variance decrease.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider an extreme case. If \u03bb is set to a very high value, the weights will be close to zero, making the model almost flat. In this case, the model has very low variance because it's not responding much to the data, but it also has high bias because it's not capturing the underlying trend in the data. This aligns with the idea that increasing \u03bb leads to higher bias and lower variance.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
