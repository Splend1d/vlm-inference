                    "text": "Alright, I've got this poem by Rudyard Kipling called \"The White Man's Burden,\" and it's from 1899. It seems to be about the British Empire and their attitude towards the people they ruled or influenced. The question is asking which kind of attitude the poem describes regarding these native peoples.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the poem. It starts with \"Take up the White Man's burden\u2014 Send forth the best ye breed\u2014 Go bind your sons to exile To serve your captives' need...\" So, it's encouraging the British to send their best people to serve the needs of the people they've captured or are ruling over.\n\nIt mentions \"fluttered folk and wild\u2014Your new-caught, sullen peoples, Half-devil and half-child.\" This seems to describe the native peoples as being wild, sullen, and somehow primitive or not fully civilized.\n\nThen it talks about taking up the burden of these savage wars of peace, filling the mouths of famine, and bidding sickness to cease. It also mentions that even when your goals are near, sloth and heathen folly can bring all hopes to nothing.\n\nSo, overall, the poem seems to be promoting the idea that it's the duty of the British (the \"white man\") to civilize and help these native peoples who are seen as less developed and almost childlike or devilish in their nature.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. They are \"exiled sons\" of the British race.\n\nWell, the poem does mention \"bind your sons to exile,\" meaning sending British people to these foreign lands. But the native peoples are referred to as \"captives\" and \"new-caught, sullen peoples.\" So, they are not seen as exiled sons of the British race but more like subjects or people to be governed and civilized by the British.\n\nB. While \"savage,\" they fight wars for the sake of a lasting peace.\n\nThe poem does refer to \"the savage wars of peace,\" which seems a bit contradictory. It might mean that the natives are fighting wars in the name of establishing peace, but it's a bit unclear. However, the tone suggests that these wars are part of the burden the white man has to bear in civilizing them, not that the natives are fighting for peace.\n\nC. They are ready for conversion to Christianity.\n\nThe poem mentions \"heathen folly,\" which implies that the natives have foolish or incorrect beliefs, possibly referring to their religious practices. However, it doesn't explicitly say they are ready for conversion. It just suggests that their ways are primitive or wrong.\n\nD. They are the product of a less-civilized and less-developed civilization.\n\nThis seems to align closely with the descriptions in the poem. The natives are called \"half-devil and half-child,\" which suggests they are not fully civilized. The reference to \"savage wars,\" \"famine,\" and \"sickness\" implies that their societies are less developed and more primitive compared to the British Empire.\n\nSo, based on the language used in the poem, it seems that the attitude towards the native peoples is that they are less civilized and developed, which aligns with option D.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any indication in the poem that the natives are seen as exiled sons of the British race? No, that seems to refer to the British people being sent to these places.\n\nOption B suggests that while savage, they fight wars for peace. The phrase \"savage wars of peace\" is a bit ambiguous, but the overall context seems to be that these wars are part of the challenges the British face in maintaining order and civilizing the natives, not that the natives are fighting for peace.\n\nOption C mentions they are ready for conversion to Christianity. While the poem does use terms like \"heathen folly,\" which could imply a need for conversion, it doesn't explicitly state that they are ready for conversion. It just highlights their perceived backwardness.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the attitude towards the native peoples in the poem is that they are the product of a less-civilized and less-developed civilization, which is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
