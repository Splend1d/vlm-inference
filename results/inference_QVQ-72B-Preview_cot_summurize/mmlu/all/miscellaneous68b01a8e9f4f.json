The options are the Boston Celtics, Los Angeles Lakers, New York Knicks, and Philadelphia 76ers. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that Phil Jackson is famous for his coaching career, especially with the Chicago Bulls and the Los Angeles Lakers, where he won a bunch of championships. But this question is about his playing days, not his coaching career.\n\nLet me think about his playing career. I recall that he was a player in the 1960s and 1970s. He was known for his height and played as a forward or center, I think. But which team did he primarily play for?\n\nOption A is the Boston Celtics. I know the Celtics were a dominant team in the 1960s under Coach Red Auerbach and players like Bill Russell and Bob Cousy. But I don't distinctly remember Phil Jackson being part of that team.\n\nOption B is the Los Angeles Lakers. They were also a prominent team during that era, with players like Wilt Chamberlain and Jerry West. Again, I don't specifically recall Phil Jackson being a Laker during his playing days.\n\nOption C is the New York Knicks. The Knicks had some good teams in the 1970s, winning championships in 1970 and 1973 with players like Willis Reed and Walt Frazier. Phil Jackson was a part of the Knicks during some of those years, I believe.\n\nOption D is the Philadelphia 76ers. The Sixers had players like Wilt Chamberlain and later Julius Erving, but again, I don't remember Phil Jackson playing for them.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look up his playing history to confirm. I know that he was drafted by the New York Knicks in 1967, but I'm not sure how long he stayed with them or if he played for any other teams after that.\n\nLet me try to recall: Phil Jackson was drafted by the Knicks in 1967 and played there until 1978. During that time, he was part of the Knicks' championship team in 1973. After the Knicks, he played briefly for the New Jersey Nets in the ABA before retiring in 1980.\n\nSo, based on that, the New York Knicks seem to be the team he played for the longest during his NBA career.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if he had any significant time with other teams. He did play for the Nets towards the end of his career, but that was only for a couple of seasons, and the Nets were in the ABA at that time, not the NBA.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. New York Knicks.\n\nWait, but the Nets were in the ABA, which was a different league from the NBA. So, strictly speaking, his time with the Nets wasn't in the NBA. That makes the Knicks the only NBA team he played for.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, Phil Jackson played for the New York Knicks in the NBA before he went into coaching.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. New York Knicks}} \\]"
