There are a few statements here, and I need to figure out which one is the main point the arguer is trying to make.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. It is wrong for society to kill a murderer.\n\nB. This follows for the reason that if a murderer is wrong in killing his victim, then society is also wrong in killing the murderer.\n\nC. If a murderer is wrong in killing his victim, then society is also wrong in killing the murderer.\n\nD. And a murderer is wrong in killing his victim.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the argument. It seems like the arguer is making a point about the morality of society executing a murderer and is drawing parallels between the murderer's act and society's act.\n\nOption A says, \"It is wrong for society to kill a murderer.\" That sounds like a direct statement of what the arguer believes, so it could be the conclusion.\n\nOption B seems to be providing a reason: \"This follows for the reason that if a murderer is wrong in killing his victim, then society is also wrong in killing the murderer.\" So, this seems to be supporting the conclusion by giving a reason why society shouldn't kill the murderer.\n\nOption C is a conditional statement: \"If a murderer is wrong in killing his victim, then society is also wrong in killing the murderer.\" This seems to be a premise or a part of the reasoning, not the main conclusion.\n\nOption D says, \"And a murderer is wrong in killing his victim.\" This is another statement that seems to be a premise, providing background information.\n\nSo, putting it together, the argument seems to be:\n\n- Premise: A murderer is wrong in killing his victim. (D)\n\n- Premise: If a murderer is wrong in killing his victim, then society is also wrong in killing the murderer. (C)\n\n- Therefore, it is wrong for society to kill a murderer. (A)\n\nAnd option B seems to be reiterating this line of reasoning, explaining why it follows that society shouldn't kill the murderer.\n\nSo, based on this, the conclusion should be option A: \"It is wrong for society to kill a murderer.\"\n\nWait a minute, but let me check again. Maybe the conclusion is option C, and option A is just a restatement of option C combined with option D.\n\nNo, option C is a conditional statement, and option A is a direct statement. The conclusion should be the main point being argued for, which is that society shouldn't kill murderers, and the premises are supporting that.\n\nSo, I think option A is the conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
