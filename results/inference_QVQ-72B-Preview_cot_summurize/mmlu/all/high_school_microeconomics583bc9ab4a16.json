                    "text": "So I have this question about Matt's demand curve for bratwurst. It says that Matt's total utility from consuming bratwurst increases at a constant rate, no matter how many bratwurst he consumes. And I need to figure out what his demand curve would look like based on this information. The options are vertical, horizontal, downward sloping, or upward sloping.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what total utility means. Total utility is the total satisfaction or happiness that a person gets from consuming a certain quantity of a good or service. So, in this case, it's the happiness Matt gets from eating bratwursts.\n\nThe question says that this total utility increases at a constant rate, no matter how many bratwursts he consumes. That means that each additional bratwurst gives him the same amount of extra utility or satisfaction. In other words, his marginal utility is constant. Marginal utility is the change in total utility from consuming one more unit of a good.\n\nUsually, we assume that marginal utility decreases as consumption increases, which is the law of diminishing marginal utility. But here, it's saying that marginal utility stays the same, no matter how many he eats.\n\nNow, I need to think about how this relates to his demand curve. A demand curve shows the quantity of a good that a consumer is willing to buy at different prices, assuming other factors remain constant.\n\nIn standard microeconomics, the demand curve is downward sloping, meaning that as the price decreases, the quantity demanded increases. This is based on the law of diminishing marginal utility and the income and substitution effects.\n\nBut in this scenario, the marginal utility is constant, which is different from the usual case.\n\nLet me think about how this constant marginal utility affects Matt's willingness to pay for additional bratwursts.\n\nIf each bratwurst gives him the same amount of extra utility, then his willingness to pay for each additional bratwurst should be constant, right? Because he gets the same level of satisfaction from each one.\n\nIn standard utility maximization, consumers choose the quantity where marginal utility equals the price.\n\nSo, if MU = P, and MU is constant, then at lower prices, he would be willing to buy more because he still gets the same MU from each additional unit.\n\nWait, that sounds like the standard downward-sloping demand curve.\n\nBut the question is trying to trick me by presenting a situation where MU is constant, which isn't the norm.\n\nLet me consider the relationship between price and quantity demanded more carefully.\n\nIf MU is constant, say MU = c, where c is a constant, then at a price P, the number of bratwursts he buys would be such that c = P.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in utility maximization, the consumer buys up to the point where MU = P.\n\nSo, if MU is constant, and P is lower, he would buy more because he still gets c utility per dollar spent.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the marginal utility per dollar.\n\nIn standard analysis, the optimal quantity is where MU/P = \u03bb, where \u03bb is the marginal utility of income.\n\nBut if MU is constant, then MU/P is constant, and as P decreases, he can buy more quantity, maintaining the same MU/P ratio.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the relationship between price and quantity demanded directly.\n\nIf MU is constant, and he buys quantity Q where MU = P, then if P decreases, he would buy more Q, since MU remains the same.\n\nSo, his demand curve would still be downward sloping, just like in the standard case, but perhaps with different elasticity.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me think about the options again:\n\nA. Vertical\n\nA vertical demand curve means that quantity demanded is fixed, regardless of price. That's a perfect inelastic demand, which isn't the case here.\n\nB. Horizontal\n\nA horizontal demand curve would mean that price is fixed, regardless of quantity demanded, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nC. Downward sloping\n\nThis is the typical demand curve shape, indicating that as price decreases, quantity demanded increases.\n\nD. Upward sloping\n\nThis would suggest that as price increases, quantity demanded also increases, which goes against the usual law of demand.\n\nGiven that MU is constant, and assuming rational consumer behavior, where he buys more when price decreases to maximize utility, the demand curve should still be downward sloping.\n\nSo, option C seems the most plausible.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf MU is constant, and price decreases, he buys more to continue getting the same MU from each additional unit.\n\nThis sounds like a standard downward-sloping demand curve.\n\nMaybe the confusion comes from the fact that with constant MU, the demand curve doesn't become perfectly elastic or anything like that.\n\nIt still responds to price changes in the usual way.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Downward sloping.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
