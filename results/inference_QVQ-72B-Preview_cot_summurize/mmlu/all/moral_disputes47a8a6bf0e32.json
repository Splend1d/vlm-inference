                    "text": "Alright, so I'm trying to understand this question about Sinnott-Armstrong's view on moral obligations. It says that if your government morally ought to do something, what does that imply about what you ought to do. The options are:\n\nA. Doesn't prove that government officials ought to promote it.\n\nB. Doesn't prove that you ought to do it.\n\nC. Proves that you ought not to do it.\n\nD. Proves that you ought to do it, too.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. Sinnott-Armstrong is a philosopher who has written about ethics and moral responsibility. I think he might be discussing how moral obligations can differ between individuals and governments.\n\nSo, the question is about the relationship between what the government ought to do and what individuals ought to do. It's asking, if the government has a moral obligation to do something, does that mean individuals also have the same obligation?\n\nOption A says it doesn't prove that government officials ought to promote it. But that seems a bit confusing because if the government ought to do something, you'd think that the officials, who are part of the government, should promote it. Maybe there's more to it.\n\nOption B says it doesn't prove that you ought to do it. This could be suggesting that moral obligations for governments are different from those for individuals. Maybe governments have obligations that individuals don't because of their unique roles and resources.\n\nOption C says it proves that you ought not to do it. That seems counterintuitive. Why would the government's moral obligation imply that individuals shouldn't do it? That doesn't make much sense to me.\n\nOption D says it proves that you ought to do it, too. This seems like the straightforward interpretation: if the government ought to do something, then maybe individuals ought to do it as well.\n\nBut I suspect it's not that simple. Governments and individuals have different capabilities and responsibilities. For example, a government might have an obligation to provide healthcare, but that doesn't mean every individual should try to provide healthcare on their own.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is B: it doesn't prove that you ought to do it. Because moral obligations can vary based on one's role in society. Governments have broader duties than individuals.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose the government ought to protect human rights. Does that mean every individual ought to protect human rights? Well, in some sense, yes, but perhaps the government has a more institutional role, like passing laws and enforcing them, whereas individuals can support human rights in their daily lives, but don't have the same means or authority.\n\nAnother example: if the government ought to reduce poverty through social programs, does that mean individuals ought to give money to the poor directly? Maybe, but perhaps their primary obligation is to support the government's efforts through taxes and advocacy.\n\nI think Sinnott-Armstrong might be arguing that moral obligations aren't one-size-fits-all. They can differ based on the agent's position and capabilities.\n\nSo, if the government ought to do something, it doesn't necessarily mean that individuals ought to do the same thing. Maybe their obligations are different.\n\nTherefore, option B seems plausible: it doesn't prove that you ought to do it.\n\nBut let's look at option A again: doesn't prove that government officials ought to promote it. If the government ought to do something, you'd think that the officials, who are responsible for implementing government policies, should promote it. But perhaps there are cases where officials have different obligations or where practical constraints prevent them from promoting it directly.\n\nOption C still seems off. Why would the government's obligation imply that individuals shouldn't do it? Unless there's a conflict of interests or some other reason, but generally, it doesn't make sense.\n\nOption D seems too absolute. Just because the government ought to do something doesn't necessarily mean that individuals ought to do it too. Their roles and abilities are different.\n\nSo, after considering these points, I think the best answer is B: doesn't prove that you ought to do it.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider Sinnott-Armstrong's work. I recall that he has discussed moral disaggregation, where moral obligations can be distributed differently among collectives and individuals.\n\nIn his view, sometimes it's appropriate to hold collectives (like governments) responsible for certain actions, while individuals within those collectives have different obligations.\n\nSo, if the government ought to do something, it doesn't automatically mean that individuals ought to do the same thing. Their obligations might be different based on their roles and capabilities.\n\nTherefore, option B aligns with this perspective.\n\nOption A might be true in some cases, but it seems more directly related to the officials themselves, not to individuals in general.\n\nOption C is still confusing because it suggests that the government's obligation negates the individual's obligation, which isn't a common moral stance.\n\nOption D is too strong because it equates the government's obligations with those of individuals, ignoring the differences in their roles and capacities.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is B: doesn't prove that you ought to do it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
