                    "text": "So I've got this property law problem here, and I need to figure out which theory gives the buyer her best chance of success in having the barrier removed from the path she's been using. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the seller sold the eastern two-thirds of his land to the buyer, who then built a house on that land. A year later, the buyer cleared a path from her house across the seller's remaining land to a road that runs along the western boundary of the seller's land. The seller watched this happen but didn't object. The buyer has been using this path daily for several months, and now the seller has put a barrier across it. The buyer is suing to have the barrier removed.\n\nOkay, so the buyer wants to continue using this path, and she's claiming some kind of right to do so. There are a few doctrines mentioned: easement by necessity, easement by implication, easement by prescription, and express easement. I need to understand which one applies best here.\n\nStarting with express easement (option D), that's when there's a written agreement or deed that grants the right to use part of someone else's land. But in this scenario, there's no mention of any such agreement regarding the path. The seller sold the eastern two-thirds of his land, but nothing is said about including a right to use a path or anything like that. So, it seems like there's no express easement here. Maybe the buyer should have gotten that in writing, but they didn't. So, option D is probably not applicable.\n\nNext, easement by necessity (option A). This usually arises when a piece of land is landlocked and needs access to a public road. The idea is that the landowner must have reasonable access to and from their property. In this case, the buyer has built a house on the eastern part, and the path leads to a road on the western part of the original land. So, the buyer's land isn't directly accessible from the road unless she uses this path.\n\nWait a minute, is the buyer's land landlocked? The path goes from her house across the seller's retained land to a road that's adjacent to the seller's land. So, presumably, the buyer's land doesn't have direct access to this road; otherwise, why would she need to cross the seller's land to get to it?\n\nAssuming that's the case, then yes, the buyer might have an easement by necessity because her land needs access to the road. But the question says, \"this would depend on the strength of the court's feeling about the use of the laid.\" I'm not sure what \"the laid\" refers to here. Maybe it's a typo or unclear phrasing. Regardless, easement by necessity is about the necessity of access, not just the convenience.\n\nThe problem mentions that the path is very convenient for the buyer's use of her land, but easement by necessity is about necessity, not just convenience. So, if the buyer's land is landlocked and there's no other reasonable means of access, then an easement by necessity might be granted.\n\nBut maybe there are other ways for the buyer to access a road without crossing the seller's land. If that's the case, then the necessity might not be there. The problem doesn't specify any other access points, so perhaps the buyer does have a claim for easement by necessity.\n\nMoving on to easement by implication (option B). This doctrine arises when there's a pre-existing use of a path or some feature on the land that was apparent at the time of the sale, and it was intended to continue after the sale.\n\nIn this scenario, the buyer cleared the path a year after purchasing the land, and the seller watched but didn't object. So, the path was created after the sale, which might make it harder to argue that it was a pre-existing use. However, perhaps there was an existing path or some indication that such a path was necessary or intended.\n\nThe problem states that the path is readily apparent to anyone, which suggests that it's clearly visible and perhaps was intended to be used. But again, it was cleared after the sale, so it's not clear if there was a pre-existing use.\n\nFor easement by implication, there needs to be a prior use that was apparent and intended to continue. Here, the path was cleared after the sale, so it might not fit neatly into this category. But it's still something to consider.\n\nLastly, easement by prescription (option C). This is when someone uses another's land openly, continuously, and without permission for a certain period, often defined by statute. In many jurisdictions, this period is around 20 years, but it can vary.\n\nIn this case, the buyer has been using the path daily for several months. That's not very long; it's certainly less than a year. Easement by prescription typically requires much longer use, often many years. So, based on the time frame provided, it seems unlikely that the buyer has established an easement by prescription yet.\n\nHowever, the problem mentions that the buyer used the path daily for several months, and it's readily apparent. Maybe in some jurisdictions, a shorter period could be sufficient under certain circumstances, but generally, it's a much longer period.\n\nGiven that, option C seems less likely to succeed compared to other options.\n\nNow, let's think about this again. The buyer cleared the path across the seller's retained land, and the seller watched but didn't object. This suggests that the seller was aware of and perhaps consented to the path being cleared and used. If that's the case, maybe there's an implication of permission, which could affect the analysis.\n\nIf the seller consented to the creation and use of the path, then perhaps there's an easement by implication or some form of implied permission based on the seller's inaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a promissory estoppel argument here, where the seller allowed the buyer to rely on being able to use the path by not objecting, and now the seller is going back on that implied promise by putting up a barrier.\n\nBut the question is asking about easements, so perhaps promissory estoppel isn't directly relevant, although it's something to consider.\n\nBetween options A, B, and C, I need to decide which one gives the buyer the best chance of success.\n\nOption A is easement by necessity, which would require that the buyer's land is landlocked and needs this path for access. The problem suggests that the buyer's land doesn't have direct road access, so this might be a viable option.\n\nOption B is easement by implication, which would require that there was a pre-existing use or intention to use the path that was apparent at the time of sale. Here, the path was cleared after the sale, which might complicate things.\n\nOption C is easement by prescription, which seems unlikely given the short period of use.\n\nGiven that, option A seems the strongest, assuming that the buyer's land is indeed landlocked and requires this path for access.\n\nBut wait, the problem says, \"the path is very convenient to the buyer's use of her land,\" but it doesn't explicitly say that it's necessary. Necessity is a key component of easement by necessity. If the path is only convenient but not necessary, then easement by necessity might not apply.\n\nPerhaps there are other ways for the buyer to access a road without crossing the seller's land. If that's the case, then the path isn't necessary; it's just more convenient.\n\nThe problem doesn't provide information about alternative access routes, so it's hard to be certain. However, since the path leads to a road that abuts the western boundary of the seller's land, and the buyer's land is the eastern two-thirds, perhaps the buyer's land has its own access to another road or something.\n\nAssuming that the buyer's land doesn't have direct road access, then the path is necessary for road access, and easement by necessity would be applicable.\n\nBut the problem mentions that the path is \"very convenient\" for the buyer's use, not necessarily \"reasonably necessary.\" There might be a difference between convenience and necessity.\n\nPerhaps the buyer's land has some other means of access, but this path is just the most convenient one. In that case, easement by necessity might not apply because it's not the only means of access.\n\nOn the other hand, if the buyer's land is truly landlocked and has no other reasonable means of access, then easement by necessity would be the way to go.\n\nGiven that, I think option A is the best choice, provided that the court finds the path to be reasonably necessary for the buyer's use of her land.\n\nOption B, easement by implication, might be a secondary consideration if there was some evidence that the path was intended to be used as part of the sale, but since it was cleared after the sale, it's less clear.\n\nOption C, easement by prescription, is unlikely due to the short period of use.\n\nTherefore, the buyer's best chance of success is likely through arguing for an easement by necessity.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
