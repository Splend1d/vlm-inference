                    "text": "So I've got this contract dispute between a company and a builder. The company hired the builder to construct a new headquarters for $100 million. Part of that was $6 million allocated for structural steel. But before work started, there was a tornado that shut down a major steel supplier, causing the price of steel to jump by 20%. That means the steel now costs $7.2 million instead of $6 million.\n\nThe builder told the company about this price hike, and they orally agreed to increase the project price to $101 million. The builder went ahead and finished the project on time, but when it came time to pay, the company only gave the builder $100 million, refusing the extra $1 million. Now, the builder is suing for that $1 million. The question is, is the builder likely to win?\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, there's an original contract for $100 million, which included $6 million for steel. Then, due to unforeseen circumstances (the tornado), the cost of steel went up by 20%, making it $7.2 million. The builder and the company orally agreed to adjust the contract price to $101 million to account for this increase.\n\nBut, the company didn't pay the extra $1 million. So, the builder is trying to get that money through the court.\n\nNow, contracts are generally binding as written, and any modifications need to be agreed upon by both parties. In many jurisdictions, modifications to contracts need to be in writing to be enforceable, especially in construction contracts.\n\nOption A says, \"No, because the modification was never reduced to a writing signed by the party to be charged.\" This suggests that because the agreement to increase the price was oral and not in writing, it's not enforceable.\n\nBut, I recall that in some cases, especially when both parties have performed under the modified terms or when there's partial performance, oral modifications can be enforceable.\n\nHowever, in construction contracts, there's often a clause requiring any changes to be in writing. If such a clause exists in the original contract, then an oral modification might not be enforceable.\n\nBut, the problem doesn't specify if there was a \"no oral modification\" clause in the original contract. Without that information, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nOption B says, \"No, because there was no consideration for the modification of the contract.\" Consideration refers to something of value exchanged between parties to make a contract enforceable. In the original contract, the consideration was the builder's construction work in exchange for $100 million.\n\nWhen they agreed to modify the contract to $101 million, what's the consideration for that modification?\n\nThe builder is agreeing to perform the same work but for an increased price. The company is agreeing to pay more due to the increased cost of steel.\n\nIn this case, the consideration from the builder's side might be the promise to continue with the project despite the increased cost of steel, and the company's consideration is the agreement to pay the additional $1 million.\n\nSo, it seems like there is consideration on both sides for the modification.\n\nTherefore, Option B doesn't seem correct.\n\nOption C says, \"Yes, because the company's promise was supported by consideration.\" As I just thought, there does seem to be consideration here, so this could be a possible answer.\n\nOption D says, \"Yes, because the modification was fair and equitable in view of the unanticipated increase in the price of structural steel.\" This suggests that the modification was just and reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nIn this scenario, the increase in steel prices was due to an unforeseen event, the tornado, which was beyond the control of either party.\n\nIn such cases, there might be doctrines like \"impracticability\" or \"frustration of purpose\" that allow for modifications or adjustments to the contract terms.\n\nHowever, these doctrines are generally invoked when performance becomes almost impossible or the purpose of the contract is destroyed, not just when costs increase.\n\nBut, in construction contracts, there might be clauses that allow for price adjustments due to changes in material costs.\n\nAgain, without knowing the specifics of the original contract, it's tough to say.\n\nHowever, the problem states that they orally agreed to the price increase, so presumably, both parties consented to the new terms.\n\nGiven that, it seems like the modification should be enforceable.\n\nBut, going back to Option A, if the original contract required modifications to be in writing, then despite the oral agreement, the modification might not be enforceable.\n\nHowever, in many legal systems, particularly in common law, there's a recognition of oral modifications, especially if both parties have acted in reliance on the modification.\n\nThe builder proceeded with the construction based on the oral agreement, and delivered the project on time.\n\nIf the company knew about the price increase and orally agreed to pay more, it might be estopped from denying the modification now that the work is done.\n\nEstoppel prevents a party from going back on their word when the other party has relied on that word to their detriment.\n\nIn this case, the builder relied on the oral agreement to proceed with the project, and now the company is refusing to pay the agreed-upon extra $1 million.\n\nSo, estoppel might be a strong argument for the builder.\n\nAdditionally, there's the concept of \"quantum meruit,\" where a party can recover the reasonable value of the services provided when there's no enforceable contract.\n\nBut, in this case, there was a contract, and they agreed to a modification, even if it wasn't in writing.\n\nGiven that, quantum meruit might not be the best fit, but the principle of enforcing the oral modification could still apply.\n\nConsidering all this, I think Option C is the most accurate answer.\n\nThe company's promise to pay the extra $1 million was supported by consideration, namely the builder's promise to proceed with the construction despite the increased steel costs.\n\nTherefore, the builder is likely to prevail in their lawsuit for the $1 million.\n\nSo, the answer is C."
