A. is possible B. is meaningless C. exists somewhere D. cannot exist\"\n\nHmm, I need to figure out what Craig is claiming about actual infinities. I think William Lane Craig is a philosopher and theologian who has written a lot about infinity and its implications for cosmology and the existence of God. He's famous for his arguments against the possibility of actual infinities, especially in the context of the universe's past.\n\nFirst, I should understand what an \"actually infinite number of things\" means. In philosophy and mathematics, there's a distinction between potential infinity and actual infinity. Potential infinity refers to a process that continues indefinitely, like counting natural numbers without ever stopping. Actual infinity, on the other hand, refers to an infinite collection of objects that exists completely at one time.\n\nCraig argues against the existence of actual infinities. He thinks that they're logically impossible or at least metaphysically impossible. One of his main arguments is based on the concept of the beginning of the universe. He suggests that if the universe had an infinite past, then it would entail the existence of an actual infinite number of past events, which he considers impossible.\n\nSo, looking at the options:\n\nA. Is possible\n\nB. Is meaningless\n\nC. Exists somewhere\n\nD. Cannot exist\n\nGiven that Craig is known for his argument against actual infinities, I would think that he would say an actual infinite number of things \"cannot exist.\" That seems to align with his position.\n\nBut let me consider each option more carefully.\n\nOption A: Is possible\n\nIf Craig thought that actual infinities are possible, he wouldn't be making such a big deal about the beginning of the universe. But he does argue that they're not possible, so this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B: Is meaningless\n\nCraig does discuss the concept of infinity, but I don't think he argues that it's meaningless. He engages with the idea quite seriously, so I don't believe he thinks it's meaningless.\n\nOption C: Exists somewhere\n\nThis seems vague. Craig argues against the existence of actual infinities in reality, particularly in the context of time and the universe. So, if this option is suggesting that actual infinities exist somewhere, it might contradict his views.\n\nOption D: Cannot exist\n\nThis seems to be the most straightforward reflection of Craig's position. He argues that actual infinities cannot exist in reality, and that any suggestion of an infinite series of events implies a logical contradiction.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the best answer is D. Cannot exist.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about any possible nuances. Craig might not be categorically denying the logical possibility of actual infinities, but rather arguing that they cannot exist in reality due to various philosophical and theological reasons.\n\nHowever, based on the question, which presents Craig's statement in a general sense, \"cannot exist\" seems to be the most accurate reflection of his view on actual infinities.\n\nSo, my final answer is D. Cannot exist.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
