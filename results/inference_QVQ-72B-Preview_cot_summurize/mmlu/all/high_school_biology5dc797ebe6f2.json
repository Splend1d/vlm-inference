                    "text": "So I'm trying to remember when crossing-over happens during meiosis. Let me think about this step by step. Meiosis is divided into two main divisions: meiosis I and meiosis II. Each of these has prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase stages. But crossing-over is specific to one of these phases, right?\n\nLet me recall what happens in each phase of meiosis I first.\n\nIn prophase I, the chromosomes condense, and homologous chromosomes pair up. I think crossing-over occurs during this phase, where homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material. Yeah, that sounds familiar.\n\nMetaphase I is when the paired chromosomes line up at the equator of the cell. Anaphase I is when the homologous chromosomes separate and move to opposite poles. Telophase I completes the first division, resulting in two haploid cells.\n\nThen meiosis II follows, which is similar to mitosis, where sister chromatids separate, producing four haploid gametes.\n\nNow, crossing-over is about exchanging genetic material between homologous chromosomes. That would make sense to happen during prophase I when homologous chromosomes are paired up and closely aligned.\n\nLet me double-check this. In prophase I, there's a structure called the synaptonemal complex that holds paired homologous chromosomes together, and recombination occurs at sites called chiasmata. Yeah, that's where crossing-over happens.\n\nIn metaphase I, the homologous pairs are aligned, but the crossing-over has already occurred in prophase I. Anaphase I is when the homologous chromosomes separate, and prophase II is another condensation phase before the sister chromatids separate in anaphase II.\n\nSo, based on this, crossing-over occurs during prophase I of meiosis I.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that crossing-over could occur in another phase? Maybe sometimes it happens in metaphase I? No, I don't think so. In metaphase I, the chromosomes are already aligned and ready to separate. Crossing-over is more about the exchange during the pairing process in prophase I.\n\nLet me consider if there's any exception or special case where crossing-over might occur in another phase, but I can't recall any. I think it's safe to say that crossing-over primarily occurs during prophase I of meiosis I.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll think about the purpose of crossing-over. It's to increase genetic diversity by shuffling genes between homologous chromosomes. This recombination is crucial for evolution and ensures that offspring have unique combinations of traits.\n\nIf I were to teach this to someone else, I'd explain that during prophase I of meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange parts through a process called crossing-over, which is important for genetic diversity.\n\nSo, to answer the question: Crossing-over occurs during prophase I of meiosis I.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Prophase I}} \\]"
