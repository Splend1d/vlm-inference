                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"As of 2017, the share of global deaths by suicide is about...\" and the options are A. 0.70%, B. 1.40%, C. 2.80%, D. 5.60%. Hmm, I need to find out what percentage of global deaths are due to suicide in 2017.\n\nFirst, I should probably look for some reliable sources that provide data on global mortality rates, especially those specifically related to suicide. The World Health Organization (WHO) comes to mind; they usually keep track of these kinds of statistics.\n\nLet me recall: The WHO releases reports on causes of death worldwide. If I can find their latest report from around 2017, that should have the information I need. Alternatively, there might be other reputable sources like academic journals or databases that could provide this data.\n\nWait a second, I think there was a study or a report that mentioned suicide rates in recent years. Let me try to recall any specific numbers I might have come across. But honestly, I'm not too sure about the exact percentage.\n\nMaybe I can think about it differently. I know that suicide is a significant global issue, but I'm not sure about its proportion compared to all causes of death. Perhaps I should consider the total number of deaths worldwide in 2017 and the number of suicides, then calculate the percentage.\n\nAlright, let's assume that in 2017, the total number of deaths worldwide was around 56 million people. That's a rough estimate I have in my head. Now, I need to find out how many of those deaths were due to suicide.\n\nI think I read somewhere that there were about 800,000 suicides globally each year. If that's the case, then the percentage would be 800,000 divided by 56 million, which would be roughly 1.43%. That seems to align with option B. 1.40%.\n\nBut I should check if that figure is accurate. Maybe the number of suicides has changed in recent years. Let me see if I can find more current data.\n\nWait, the question specifies \"as of 2017,\" so if the data is from that year, 800,000 suicides seems to be a common figure often cited, but I need to confirm if that's accurate for 2017 specifically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the suicide rate per 100,000 people and then calculate the percentage from there. I recall that the global suicide rate was around 10.6 per 100,000 people, but again, I'm not sure about the exact year.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I can look for the proportion of deaths due to self-harm or intentional self-harm, as suicide might be categorized under different names in some statistics.\n\nAlso, I should consider that suicide mortality might vary significantly between countries, so global figures are an average of many different rates.\n\nAnother thought: Perhaps I can look at the burden of disease measurements, like Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), which might give an indication of the impact of suicide beyond just mortality.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the share of global deaths, so DALYs might not be directly relevant here.\n\nLet me consider if there's any trend over time. Has the proportion of deaths due to suicide been increasing or decreasing? I think that suicide rates have been relatively stable or perhaps slightly decreasing in some regions, but I'm not entirely sure about the global trend.\n\nMaybe I should look at the WHO's Global Health Estimates or their World Health Statistics reports from around 2017 to get the most accurate information.\n\nAlternatively, there are databases like the World Bank's Health Statistics or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), although the CDC primarily focuses on the United States.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look at news articles or press releases from 2017 related to suicide statistics. Sometimes, organizations like WHO release summaries or key findings that are easy to find.\n\nLet me try to recall if there was any significant news about suicide rates in 2017. I don't remember anything off the top of my head, but that might not be a reliable indicator.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe I can look at the top causes of death globally and see where suicide fits in. According to WHO, the leading causes of death include cardiovascular diseases, cancers, respiratory infections, and diabetes, among others. Suicide might not be among the top ten, but it's still a substantial cause of death, especially in certain age groups.\n\nIn fact, I think suicide is one of the leading causes of death among young people worldwide. But again, that doesn't directly answer the question about the percentage of total deaths.\n\nLet me try to do a rough calculation. If total deaths are around 56 million and suicides are 800,000, then:\n\nPercentage = (800,000 / 56,000,000) * 100 \u2248 1.43%\n\nSo, that points to option B. 1.40%.\n\nBut I should check if the total number of deaths and suicides in 2017 were indeed around those figures.\n\nUpon a quick search in my memory, I recall that the WHO reported around 800,000 suicide deaths per year, and the total global deaths are roughly 56 million, so the calculation seems consistent.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there are any variations based on different sources or years. Maybe some regions have higher or lower suicide rates, which could affect the global average.\n\nAdditionally, reporting accuracy can vary between countries, which might impact the overall statistics.\n\nBut since the question is about the share as of 2017, and based on the data I can recall, 1.40% seems to be a reasonable estimate.\n\nTherefore, I would go with option B. 1.40%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
