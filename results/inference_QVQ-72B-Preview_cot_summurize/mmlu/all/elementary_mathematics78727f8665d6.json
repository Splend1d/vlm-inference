I need to find out how many subjects she studied.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"1 over 2 hour\" means. That's probably a fraction of an hour, right? So, 1 over 2 is 0.5 hours, which is 30 minutes. So, she spent 30 minutes on science.\n\nNow, she spent equal amounts of time on all subjects. That means each subject got the same amount of time as science. So, if she has n subjects, and each subject gets 0.5 hours, then the total time spent would be n times 0.5 hours.\n\nBut I know that the total time she spent on homework is 3 hours. So, I can set up an equation:\n\nn * 0.5 hours = 3 hours\n\nNow, I need to solve for n. To do that, I can divide both sides of the equation by 0.5 hours.\n\nn = 3 / 0.5\n\nLet me calculate that. 3 divided by 0.5 is the same as 3 multiplied by 2, because 1 divided by 0.5 is 2. So, 3 * 2 = 6.\n\nSo, n = 6. That means she studied 6 subjects.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If each subject is 0.5 hours, and total time is 3 hours, then 0.5 * 6 = 3, which checks out. And 0.5 is the same as 1 over 2, so that makes sense.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it. Maybe using fractions. 1 over 2 is 1/2, and 3 hours is 6/2. So, if each subject is 1/2 hour, then 6 subjects would be 6*(1/2) = 6/2 = 3 hours, which matches the total time.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of minutes. 3 hours is 180 minutes, and 0.5 hours is 30 minutes per subject. So, 180 divided by 30 is 6 subjects. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think I'm confident with the answer being 6 subjects. So, the correct choice is C. 6 subjects.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other factor that I might have missed. The problem says she spent equal amounts of time on all subjects, and she spent 1 over 2 hour on science, which I assume is per subject. There doesn't seem to be any other information given that would affect the total number of subjects.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is C. 6 subjects.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
