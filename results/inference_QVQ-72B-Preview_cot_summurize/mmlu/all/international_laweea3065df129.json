                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Can countries rely on their domestic law as an excuse to violate their obligations under international law?\" And there are four options to choose from. Let me read them again to make sure I understand.\n\nOption A says, \"Domestic law always prevails over international law.\" Option B is, \"Only customary international law prevails over domestic law.\" Option C states, \"Obligations under international law prevail over domestic law.\" And finally, Option D claims, \"Constitutional obligations always prevail over obligations under international law.\"\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which one is correct. I remember that there's a principle in international law called \"pacta sunt servanda,\" which means that agreements must be kept. But I'm not sure how that relates directly to this question.\n\nLet me think about the relationship between domestic law and international law. I know that countries can enter into treaties and other international agreements that create obligations for them. But how do these obligations interact with their domestic laws?\n\nI think that generally, when a country ratifies an international treaty, it becomes part of the country's law. In some legal systems, like in the UK, treaties have to be incorporated into domestic law through legislation to have effect. In other systems, like in France, treaties can have direct effect without needing additional legislation.\n\nBut what happens if there's a conflict between domestic law and international law? Which one takes precedence?\n\nI recall that in international law, there's a hierarchy of norms. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties says that a state must perform its treaty obligations in good faith. So, if a country's domestic law conflicts with its international obligations, it can't use its domestic law as an excuse for not fulfilling those obligations.\n\nWait, that sounds familiar. Let me check the Vienna Convention. Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties states: \"A party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty.\"\n\nSo, according to this, a country can't say, \"Oh, our domestic law doesn't allow us to do this, so we're not going to fulfill our treaty obligations.\" That means that international obligations prevail over domestic law.\n\nLooking back at the options, Option C says, \"Obligations under international law prevail over domestic law.\" That seems to align with what I just read from the Vienna Convention.\n\nBut let's consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A says, \"Domestic law always prevails over international law.\" Well, if that were the case, countries could just pass a law that contradicts their international obligations and then ignore those obligations. That doesn't seem right, and it doesn't align with the Vienna Convention's Article 27.\n\nOption B says, \"Only customary international law prevails over domestic law.\" Customary international law is law that's derived from the consistent practice of states followed out of a sense of legal obligation. It's another source of international law besides treaties. But according to the Vienna Convention, it's not only customary international law that prevails; treaties also create binding obligations that must be fulfilled regardless of domestic law.\n\nOption D says, \"Constitutional obligations always prevail over obligations under international law.\" This one is tricky. Some countries have constitutions that establish international treaties as supreme law, meaning that treaties take precedence over domestic laws, including the constitution in some cases. In other countries, the constitution might be the supreme law, and treaties can't override it without constitutional amendment.\n\nFor example, in the United States, the Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and treaties are on the same level as federal statutes. If there's a conflict between a treaty and the Constitution, the Constitution prevails.\n\nIn contrast, in countries like Germany, treaties can have direct effect and prevail over domestic laws, including the constitution in some instances.\n\nSo, it seems that whether constitutional obligations prevail over international law depends on the domestic legal system of each country.\n\nGiven that, Option D isn't a universal principle of international law; it's dependent on each country's legal system.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer seems to be Option C: obligations under international law prevail over domestic law.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure I'm not missing something. I know that in practice, it's often difficult to enforce international law against domestic law, especially within a sovereign state. But in terms of principles, according to the Vienna Convention, a state can't invoke its domestic law to avoid its treaty obligations.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose a country signs and ratifies a treaty that requires it to take certain actions. Then, its domestic law conflicts with that treaty. According to international law, which should prevail?\n\nThe answer is that the international obligation should prevail, and the country should amend its domestic law to comply with the treaty.\n\nBut in reality, countries sometimes prioritize their domestic laws over international obligations, which can lead to international disputes and sanctions.\n\nHowever, in terms of international legal principles, it's clear that international obligations should take precedence over domestic law.\n\nSo, going back to the question, the correct answer is Option C: obligations under international law prevail over domestic law.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if there are any exceptions or special cases where domestic law might prevail.\n\nWell, as I mentioned earlier, in some countries, the constitution is the supreme law, and international treaties can't override it without a constitutional amendment. In such cases, domestic constitutional law prevails over international law.\n\nBut again, this is a matter of domestic law, not a principle of international law.\n\nIn international law, the principle is that a state must comply with its treaty obligations, regardless of its domestic law.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: obligations under international law prevail over domestic law."
