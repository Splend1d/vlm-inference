                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about a pendulum. So, there's a ball attached to a string, and it's swinging back and forth. The period is 0.4 seconds, and it's being released from an angle of 50 degrees below the horizontal. The question is asking which change would decrease the period.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the period of a pendulum is. I think the period is the time it takes for the pendulum to complete one full swing, right? So, if the period is shorter, that means the pendulum swings back and forth faster.\n\nNow, I need to think about what factors affect the period of a pendulum. I remember that for a simple pendulum, the period is given by the formula:\n\n\\[T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}}\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(T\\) is the period,\n\n- \\(L\\) is the length of the pendulum,\n\n- \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nWait a minute, looking at this formula, it seems like the period only depends on the length of the pendulum and gravity. It doesn't mention the mass of the ball or the angle at which it's released. So, according to this, changing the mass or the angle shouldn't affect the period.\n\nBut let's think carefully. The problem mentions that the string is raised to an angle of 50 degrees below the horizontal and released. Does this angle affect the period? Well, in the formula, the period is independent of the amplitude of the swing, assuming small angles. But 50 degrees might not be considered a small angle. Maybe I need to consider the small-angle approximation.\n\nIn the small-angle approximation, the period is approximately given by the formula I wrote earlier. But for larger angles, like 50 degrees, the period might be different. Maybe the period increases with larger angles, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions that the period is 0.4 seconds. Maybe this is the measured period for this specific pendulum, even at 50 degrees.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Increasing the mass of the ball\n\nAccording to the formula, the period doesn't depend on the mass. So, changing the mass shouldn't affect the period. So, this shouldn't decrease the period.\n\nB. Decreasing the length of the string\n\nAccording to the formula, the period is proportional to the square root of the length. So, if I decrease the length, the period should decrease. Wait, but the formula has \\(L\\) in the numerator under the square root, so decreasing \\(L\\) would decrease \\(T\\).\n\nWait, no. Actually, since \\(T\\) is proportional to \\(\\sqrt{L}\\), decreasing \\(L\\) would decrease \\(T\\). So, this seems like a possible answer.\n\nC. Decreasing the angle of the string from the horizontal when released\n\nAccording to the small-angle approximation, for smaller angles, the period should be closer to the value given by the formula. But does decreasing the angle increase or decrease the period? I think decreasing the angle would actually make the period shorter, but I'm not sure.\n\nD. Decreasing the mass of the ball\n\nAgain, similar to option A, since the period doesn't depend on the mass, changing the mass shouldn't affect the period.\n\nSo, based on this, option B seems the most plausible answer. Decreasing the length of the string should decrease the period.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something about the amplitude affecting the period that I'm missing.\n\nI recall that for larger amplitudes, the period is actually longer than what the simple formula predicts. There's a correction factor involving the sine of the angle, I think. So, if the amplitude is larger, the period is longer, and vice versa.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then decreasing the angle (option C) would decrease the period. Hmm, that seems contradictory to what I thought earlier.\n\nLet me look up the exact expression for the period of a pendulum with larger amplitudes.\n\nUpon checking, the period of a pendulum for larger amplitudes is given by:\n\n\\[T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\theta_0^2}{16} + \\cdots\\right)\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\theta_0\\) is the initial angle in radians.\n\nSo, for larger angles, the period is longer than the small-angle approximation.\n\nTherefore, decreasing the angle would decrease the period beyond what the simple formula predicts.\n\nSo, option C is also a possible answer.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for a change that would decrease the period. So, both decreasing the length of the string (option B) and decreasing the angle (option C) could decrease the period.\n\nBut the question is probably expecting a single best answer, so maybe I need to consider which one has a more significant effect.\n\nLet me think about it differently. The period of a pendulum is primarily determined by its length and the gravitational acceleration. The mass of the pendulum bob doesn't affect the period, which is why options A and D are unlikely to be correct.\n\nThe amplitude, however, does have some effect, especially at larger angles. But in practical terms, the length is the primary determinant.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options provided, I think the most straightforward answer is option B: decreasing the length of the string.\n\nThis is because changing the length directly affects the period, as per the formula, whereas changing the angle has a secondary effect that might be smaller in magnitude.\n\nTherefore, I would go with option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
