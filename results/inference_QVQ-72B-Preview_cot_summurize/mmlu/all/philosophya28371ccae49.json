The options are:\n\nA. they cannot be measured\n\nB. science can study them\n\nC. they do not have extension\n\nD. they have extension\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what Descartes believed about physical things. I remember that Descartes was a philosopher who is famous for his ideas about mind and body being separate substances. He thought that the mind is non-physical, and the body is physical.\n\nNow, the question is about physical things, so that would be the body or material objects. According to Descartes, what is the main feature of these things?\n\nOption A says they cannot be measured. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. If something is physical, like a table or a chair, we can measure its length, width, height, right? So, physical things can be measured.\n\nOption B says science can study them. Well, yes, science does study physical things, like physics studies matter and energy, biology studies living organisms, etc. But is this the chief characteristic that Descartes attributed to physical things? I think there's something more specific.\n\nOption C says they do not have extension. But wait, extension is often referred to as the characteristic of being extended in space. Since physical objects occupy space, they should have extension. So, saying they do not have extension seems incorrect.\n\nOption D says they have extension. This seems plausible. Descartes did consider extension to be the fundamental property of physical substances.\n\nLet me double-check this. I recall that Descartes distinguished between mental and physical substances based on their properties. The mind is thought to be non-extended, meaning it doesn't occupy space, whereas the body is extended.\n\nSo, if extension is the property that defines physical substances, then option D seems correct.\n\nBut let's make sure there isn't something else that Descartes considered more fundamental. Did he have any other primary attribute for physical things?\n\nI think that extension is indeed the chief characteristic he attributed to physical things. He even defined matter as simply extension.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. they have extension.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other perspective that might make another option seem attractive.\n\nOption A: they cannot be measured \u2013 but that seems contrary to the nature of physical things, which are measurable.\n\nOption B: science can study them \u2013 while true, this is more about the scope of scientific inquiry rather than a defining characteristic of physical things according to Descartes.\n\nOption C: they do not have extension \u2013 this directly contradicts Descartes' view of physical substances.\n\nSo, after considering all options, I'm confident that D. they have extension is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
