                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Parfit, Taurek, and Lewis. The question says that according to Parfit, both Taurek and Lewis assume that for there to be a \"sum of pain,\" it must be:\n\nA. all felt at a single time.\n\nB. all felt by a single person.\n\nC. all be caused by a single source.\n\nD. all of the above.\n\nI need to figure out what Parfit is saying about these views. I'm not super familiar with Parfit, Taurek, or Lewis, but I think Parfit is a philosopher who wrote about ethics and personal identity, and Taurek and Lewis are also philosophers who have contributed to ethical theories.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a \"sum of pain\" means in this context. I think it refers to the total amount of suffering or pain experienced by individuals in a given situation. So, Parfit is saying that Taurek and Lewis assume certain conditions must be met for us to talk about a sum of pain.\n\nOption A says that all pain must be felt at a single time. That seems interesting. Maybe they think that pain at different times doesn't add up unless it's simultaneous. But that seems a bit odd because I would think that pain over time can be summed up even if it's not all at once.\n\nOption B says that all pain must be felt by a single person. So, perhaps Taurek and Lewis think that pain from different people can't be added together. That also seems like a strong assertion. Most ethical theories do consider the total pain across multiple people.\n\nOption C says that all pain must be caused by a single source. So, maybe they think that pain from different causes can't be summed up. Again, that seems contrary to common moral intuitions, where we consider the total harm done, regardless of the cause.\n\nOption D suggests that all of the above are assumed by Taurek and Lewis.\n\nNow, I need to recall what Parfit actually says about this. I remember reading something about Parfit discussing Taurek's view on aggregating harms, particularly in the context of rescue scenarios. Taurek argued against saving more people if it meant risking one person's life, suggesting that each person's life has equal value and shouldn't be compared statistically.\n\nParfit, on the other hand, criticizes this view and argues for a more utilitarian approach, where the total sum of happiness or suffering is considered.\n\nWait, but the question is about the assumptions Taurek and Lewis make regarding the sum of pain. I need to find out specifically what Parfit says about their assumptions in this context.\n\nI think I need to look back at Parfit's work, probably in \"Reasons and Persons\" or some other ethical writings. Let me try to recall or find a specific passage.\n\nIn Parfit's discussion of Taurek's view, Taurek presents a case where one can save either one person for certain or take a risk to save more people, but with the possibility of saving no one. Taurek argues that one should save the certain one rather than gamble with multiple lives.\n\nParfit, however, thinks that this overlooks the importance of maximizing total welfare. He believes that Taurek assumes that each person's life is a self-contained unit and that one shouldn't aggregate risks across lives.\n\nSo, relating this back to the question, perhaps Taurek and Lewis assume that pain or harm can't be aggregated across different people, which would correspond to option B: all felt by a single person.\n\nBut I need to confirm if Parfit attributes this assumption to both Taurek and Lewis. I know that David Lewis is another philosopher who has written on ethics, particularly on decision theory and the ethics of risk.\n\nLet me think about Lewis's views. Lewis is known for his work on expected utility theory and decision-making under uncertainty. He might have similar assumptions about aggregating pain or harm.\n\nBut I need to find a direct reference to Parfit discussing their assumptions about the sum of pain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to a specific passage in Parfit's work that I'm not recalling right now.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider that Parfit is critiquing Taurek and Lewis for assuming that pain must be aggregated under certain conditions, and he disagrees with those assumptions.\n\nIf that's the case, then the answer might be D: all of the above, meaning that Taurek and Lewis assume that pain must be felt at a single time, by a single person, and caused by a single source, for it to be summed.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure if that's accurate. It seems unlikely that Taurek and Lewis would hold such stringent conditions for aggregating pain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Parfit is critiquing their view by pointing out that their assumptions imply that pain must meet these conditions to be summed, and he finds that problematic.\n\nGiven that, maybe the correct answer is B: all felt by a single person, because Parfit is arguing against the idea that pain can only be summed within a single person's experience, and not across different people.\n\nThis makes sense because one of the key points in Parfit's critique of Taurek is about the importance of considering the total sum of welfare across multiple people, not just within one person.\n\nTherefore, Parfit is likely arguing that Taurek and Lewis assume that pain must be all felt by a single person to be summed, and Parfit disagrees with this assumption.\n\nSo, my best guess is that the answer is B: all felt by a single person.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
