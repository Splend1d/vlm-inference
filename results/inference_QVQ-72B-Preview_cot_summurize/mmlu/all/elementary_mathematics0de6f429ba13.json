                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: a number is rounded to the nearest hundred, and the result is 500. I need to figure out which of these numbers\u2014458, 463, 547, or 559\u2014could not be the original number before rounding. Okay, let's think about how rounding works.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you round a number to the nearest hundred, you look at the tens digit. If the tens digit is 5 or more, you round up to the next hundred. If it's less than 5, you round down to the previous hundred. So, for a number to round to 500, its hundreds digit must be 4 or 5, right? Wait, no, actually, if the hundreds digit is 5, that would be 500 already, but no, wait, 500 is the rounded number. Hmm.\n\nLet me rephrase: numbers that are between 450 and 549 should round to 500 because they are closer to 500 than to 400 or 600. Wait, is that correct? Let me think about 450: it's exactly halfway between 400 and 500. In standard rounding rules, when a number is exactly halfway, we round up. So, 450 would round up to 500. Similarly, 549 is closer to 500 than to 600, so it would also round to 500.\n\nSo, the range of numbers that round to 500 should be from 450 to 549, inclusive. Any number outside this range wouldn't round to 500. Let's check the options:\n\nA. 458: That's within 450 to 549, so it should round to 500.\n\nB. 463: Also within the range, so it should round to 500.\n\nC. 547: Still within the range, so it should round to 500.\n\nD. 559: This is outside the range; it's greater than 549, so it should round to 600.\n\nWait a minute, 559 is outside the 450-549 range, so it shouldn't round to 500. Instead, it should round to 600 because it's closer to 600 than to 500. So, 559 couldn't be the number before rounding to the nearest hundred if the result is 500.\n\nBut let me double-check. If I have 559, is it closer to 500 or 600? 559 - 500 = 59, and 600 - 559 = 41. Since 41 is less than 59, 559 is closer to 600, so it should round to 600, not 500.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 559.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check the other options again:\n\nA. 458: It's within the range of 450-549, and 458 - 500 = 42, which is less than 50, so it rounds to 500.\n\nB. 463: 463 - 500 = 37, which is less than 50, so it rounds to 500.\n\nC. 547: 547 - 500 = 47, which is less than 50, so it rounds to 500.\n\nD. 559: As we established, it's closer to 600, so it rounds to 600, not 500.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 559.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
