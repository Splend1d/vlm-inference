                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a body moving in the positive x-direction. It passes the origin at time t=0 and between t=0 and t=1 second, it has a constant speed of 24 meters per second. Then, at t=1 second, it's given a constant acceleration of 6 meters per second squared in the negative x-direction. I need to find the position x of the body at t=11 seconds.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening in the different time intervals. From t=0 to t=1 second, the body is moving at a constant speed without any acceleration. Then, from t=1 second onward, it starts experiencing a constant acceleration in the negative x-direction.\n\nLet me break this down step by step.\n\n**Step 1: From t=0 to t=1 second**\n\nThe body has a constant speed of 24 m/s. Since it's moving at a constant speed, there's no acceleration during this interval. I can calculate the displacement during this time using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta x = v \\times t\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(v\\) is the velocity (which is the same as speed since it's moving in a straight line at constant speed),\n\n- \\(t\\) is the time interval.\n\nGiven that, at t=0, the body is at the origin (x=0), so its position at t=1 second will be:\n\n\\[\nx_1 = \\Delta x = 24 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 1 \\, \\text{s} = 24 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nSo, at t=1 second, the body is at x=24 meters.\n\n**Step 2: From t=1 second onward**\n\nAt t=1 second, the body starts experiencing a constant acceleration of 6 m/s\u00b2 in the negative x-direction. This means it's decelerating if we consider its velocity in the positive x-direction.\n\nTo find the position at t=11 seconds, I need to find out how much additional displacement occurs from t=1 to t=11 seconds due to this acceleration.\n\nFirst, let's find out the time interval during which acceleration is applied. The acceleration starts at t=1 second and continues until t=11 seconds. So, the time interval for acceleration is:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta t = 11 \\, \\text{s} - 1 \\, \\text{s} = 10 \\, \\text{s}\n\\]\n\nDuring this 10-second interval, the body has an initial velocity of 24 m/s (since it was moving at that speed at t=1 second) and a constant acceleration of -6 m/s\u00b2 (negative because it's in the negative x-direction).\n\nI can use the equations of motion to find the displacement during this accelerated motion.\n\nThe relevant equation for displacement under constant acceleration is:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta x = v_i \\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2} a (\\Delta t)^2\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(v_i\\) is the initial velocity,\n\n- \\(a\\) is the acceleration,\n\n- \\(\\Delta t\\) is the time interval.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta x = 24 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 10 \\, \\text{s} + \\frac{1}{2} \\times (-6 \\, \\text{m/s}^2) \\times (10 \\, \\text{s})^2\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, calculate the first term:\n\n\\[\n24 \\times 10 = 240 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nThen, calculate the second term:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times (-6) \\times (10)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (-6) \\times 100 = -300 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta x = 240 \\, \\text{m} + (-300 \\, \\text{m}) = -60 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nThis means that during the 10 seconds of acceleration, the body moves 60 meters in the negative x-direction from its position at t=1 second.\n\n**Step 3: Find the total position at t=11 seconds**\n\nNow, to find the position at t=11 seconds, I need to add this displacement to the position at t=1 second.\n\nAt t=1 second, the position was x=24 meters.\n\nDisplacement from t=1 to t=11 seconds is -60 meters.\n\nTherefore, the position at t=11 seconds is:\n\n\\[\nx_{11} = x_1 + \\Delta x = 24 \\, \\text{m} + (-60 \\, \\text{m}) = -36 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the body is at x=-36 meters at t=11 seconds.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nStarting at x=0 at t=0, moving to x=24 m at t=1 s, then moving -60 m from t=1 s to t=11 s, which brings it to x= -36 m.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me consider if the body changes direction during the accelerated phase.\n\nGiven that the acceleration is in the negative x-direction, and the initial velocity is in the positive x-direction, the body will start slowing down from t=1 second onward.\n\nLet me calculate the velocity at t=11 seconds to ensure everything makes sense.\n\nThe velocity at t=11 seconds can be found using the equation:\n\n\\[\nv = v_i + a \\Delta t\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(v_i\\) is the initial velocity (at t=1 s),\n\n- \\(a\\) is the acceleration,\n\n- \\(\\Delta t\\) is the time interval (from t=1 s to t=11 s).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nv = 24 \\, \\text{m/s} + (-6 \\, \\text{m/s}^2) \\times 10 \\, \\text{s} = 24 \\, \\text{m/s} - 60 \\, \\text{m/s} = -36 \\, \\text{m/s}\n\\]\n\nSo, at t=11 seconds, the velocity is -36 m/s, which means it's moving in the negative x-direction.\n\nThis makes sense because the acceleration is in the negative direction, and it has been applied for 10 seconds, enough to not only reduce the positive velocity to zero but also to reverse it to -36 m/s.\n\nTherefore, the position at t=11 seconds is indeed x= -36 meters.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 99m\n\nB. 36m\n\nC. -36m\n\nD. -99m\n\nThe correct answer is C. -36m.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any possibility of miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for position as a function of time considering the entire duration from t=0 to t=11 seconds.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=1 second, the body moves with constant velocity v=24 m/s.\n\nFrom t=1 second to t=11 seconds, it has constant acceleration a= -6 m/s\u00b2.\n\nI can treat the motion in two parts as I did earlier, or I can consider the entire motion from t=0 to t=11 seconds with a piecewise constant acceleration.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for position in uniformly accelerated motion.\n\nThe general equation for position in uniformly accelerated motion is:\n\n\\[\nx = x_0 + v_0 t + \\frac{1}{2} a t^2\n\\]\n\nBut in this case, the acceleration is not constant over the entire 11 seconds; it's only applied after t=1 second.\n\nSo, it's better to divide the motion into two parts as I did initially.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that from t=0 to t=1 second, the body moves with constant velocity, and from t=1 second to t=11 seconds, it has constant acceleration.\n\nI can calculate the position at t=11 seconds relative to t=0 by integrating the velocity over time.\n\nFirst, from t=0 to t=1 second:\n\n\\[\nv(t) = 24 \\, \\text{m/s} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad 0 \\leq t < 1 \\, \\text{s}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx(t) = 24t \\, \\text{m} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad 0 \\leq t < 1 \\, \\text{s}\n\\]\n\nAt t=1 s:\n\n\\[\nx(1) = 24 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nFrom t=1 second to t=11 seconds, the velocity changes due to constant acceleration.\n\nThe velocity as a function of time from t=1 s onward is:\n\n\\[\nv(t) = v_i + a(t - t_0) = 24 \\, \\text{m/s} + (-6 \\, \\text{m/s}^2)(t - 1 \\, \\text{s})\n\\]\n\nThe position from t=1 s onward is:\n\n\\[\nx(t) = x_1 + \\int_{1}^{t} v(t') \\, dt' = 24 \\, \\text{m} + \\int_{1}^{t} \\left[24 - 6(t' - 1)\\right] \\, dt'\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx(t) = 24 + \\left[24t' - 3(t')^2 + 3t'\\right]_{1}^{t}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx(t) = 24 + \\left[ (24t - 3t^2 + 3t) - (24(1) - 3(1)^2 + 3(1)) \\right]\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx(t) = 24 + (27t - 3t^2) - (24 - 3 + 3)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx(t) = 24 + 27t - 3t^2 - 24\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx(t) = -3t^2 + 27t\n\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my integration.\n\nActually, the integral of \\(v(t) = 24 - 6(t - 1)\\) from t=1 to t is:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{1}^{t} (24 - 6(t' - 1)) \\, dt' = \\int_{1}^{t} (24 - 6t' + 6) \\, dt' = \\int_{1}^{t} (30 - 6t') \\, dt'\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\left[ 30t' - 3(t')^2 \\right]_{1}^{t} = (30t - 3t^2) - (30(1) - 3(1)^2) = 30t - 3t^2 - 27\n\\]\n\nSo, the position is:\n\n\\[\nx(t) = x_1 + \\left[ 30t - 3t^2 - 27 \\right] = 24 + 30t - 3t^2 - 27 = -3t^2 + 30t + 24 - 27 = -3t^2 + 30t - 3\n\\]\n\nNow, plugging in t=11 s:\n\n\\[\nx(11) = -3(11)^2 + 30(11) - 3 = -3(121) + 330 - 3 = -363 + 330 - 3 = -36 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the position at t=11 seconds is indeed -36 meters.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. -36m.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-36\\ \\text{m}} \\]"
