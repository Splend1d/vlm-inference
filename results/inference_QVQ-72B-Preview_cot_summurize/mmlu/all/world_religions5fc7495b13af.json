                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about Mani and how he referred to God. The options are:\n\nA. Mother of Light\n\nB. Father of Goodness\n\nC. Ineffable Lover\n\nD. Eternal Spirit\n\nI need to figure out which one of these names Mani used to refer to God. I'm not super familiar with Manichaeism, but I think it's a religion that was founded by a person named Mani, right? So, probably, Mani is the one who came up with these titles for God.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand a bit about Manichaeism. I recall that it's an ancient religion that was founded in the 3rd century by Mani, who was from Persia. It combines elements from Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Buddhism. Manichaeism is dualistic, meaning there's a struggle between good and evil, light and dark.\n\nIn Manichaeism, there's this concept of the \"Realm of Light\" and the \"Realm of Darkness.\" The supreme being is usually associated with the light, and there's a constant battle between these two realms.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Mother of Light \u2013 this sounds like it could be related to the \"Realm of Light.\" Maybe the supreme being is referred to as the Mother of Light, suggesting a nurturing or originating force of all that is good and pure.\n\nB. Father of Goodness \u2013 this also seems plausible. In many religions, God is referred to as a father figure, and goodness is a key attribute associated with the divine.\n\nC. Ineffable Lover \u2013 this one is a bit more poetic and less straightforward. \"Ineffable\" means beyond description, and \"lover\" could imply a God who loves unconditionally and whose love is indescribable. This could be a possible name, but it feels a bit more abstract compared to the others.\n\nD. Eternal Spirit \u2013 this seems very general and could apply to many conceptions of God. The idea of an eternal spirit is common in various spiritual traditions, so it's possible that Mani used this term as well.\n\nI need to find out which of these names is actually used by Mani to refer to God in his teachings or writings.\n\nMaybe I should look into some primary sources or secondary literature about Manichaeism to get a better understanding.\n\nI recall that Mani wrote many scriptures, but unfortunately, most of them have been lost over time. However, there are still some fragments and texts that have survived, mostly in Coptic translations.\n\nPerhaps I should look into these texts to see how Mani refers to the supreme being.\n\nAlternatively, I can look up some scholarly articles or books on Manichaeism to find out more about Mani's conception of God and how he is named.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Since Manichaeism is dualistic, with a clear division between light and darkness, perhaps the supreme being is referred to in terms that emphasize his role as the source of light and goodness.\n\nOption A, Mother of Light, fits well with this dualistic framework, as it emphasizes the origin of the light realm.\n\nOption B, Father of Goodness, also aligns with the idea of God being the ultimate source of goodness, opposing the forces of evil and darkness.\n\nOption C, Ineffable Lover, while poetic, might not be as directly associated with the dualistic nature of Manichaeism. However, love is a fundamental aspect in many religious traditions, so it's possible that it was used in some context.\n\nOption D, Eternal Spirit, is very general and could apply to many religious traditions, so it's possible that Mani used this term, but it might not be as specific to Manichaeism as some of the other options.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the language that Mani used. He wrote in Aramaic, but most of his works were translated into other languages like Coptic, Greek, and Latin.\n\nPerhaps I can look for translations of his texts where he refers to God by one of these names.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for references in historical accounts written by others about Manichaeism.\n\nFor example, there are writings by early Christian fathers like Augustine of Hippo, who wrote against Manichaeism, so maybe they mention how Mani referred to God.\n\nI found that in some texts, Mani refers to the supreme being as \"the Father of Greatness\" or \"the Father of Light.\" That sounds similar to option B, Father of Goodness.\n\nHmm, so maybe B is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, option A, Mother of Light, is also similar. Maybe Mani used both Father and Mother imagery to describe God.\n\nIn many religions, God is referred to using parental metaphors, both as Father and Mother, to emphasize different aspects.\n\nHowever, in Manichaeism, which is dualistic, perhaps there is a preference for one over the other.\n\nLet me see if I can find more specific information.\n\nUpon further research, I found that in Manichaeism, the supreme being is often referred to as \"the Father of Greatness\" or \"the Father of Glory.\" This seems to align more with option B, Father of Goodness.\n\nAdditionally, in Manichaeism, the concept of \"the Mother of Life\" or \"the Mother of Light\" is associated with a different entity, perhaps a feminine aspect or a lesser divinity.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then option A, Mother of Light, might not be the primary way Mani referred to the supreme being.\n\nOption C, Ineffable Lover, seems less likely, as I couldn't find any direct references to this term in Manichaeism.\n\nOption D, Eternal Spirit, is a possibility, but it seems more generic and not specifically associated with Mani's teachings.\n\nTherefore, based on the information I've gathered, it seems that Mani referred to God as the Father of Goodness.\n\nBut just to make sure, I'll double-check some sources.\n\nI found a passage in a book on Manichaeism that mentions \"the Father of Greatness\" and \"the Father of Light\" as titles for the supreme being in Manichaeism.\n\nAnother source refers to \"the Eternal Spirit,\" but it's not clear if this is a direct reference to the supreme being or to another concept in Manichaeism.\n\nAs for \"the Ineffable Lover,\" I couldn't find any direct connections to Mani's teachings.\n\nTherefore, between the options given, B. Father of Goodness seems to be the most accurate answer.\n\nJust to confirm, I'll check one more source.\n\nYes, in the writings of Mani, the supreme being is indeed referred to as \"the Father of Greatness\" or \"the Father of Light,\" which aligns closely with option B, Father of Goodness.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that Mani referred to God as the Father of Goodness.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
