                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario entails. There are two scenarios:\n\n1. I shoplifted the Porsche.\n\n2. I guarded my best friend's dark secrets.\n\nAnd the question is asking which of these actions is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nOkay, so let's consider each scenario individually.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: I shoplifted the Porsche.\n\nShoplifting is taking something from a store without paying for it. So, in this case, it's a Porsche, which is a high-value item. Now, shoplifting is not only illegal but also widely considered morally wrong. It's stealing, plain and simple. Taking someone else's property without their permission is against the law and against most moral codes. So, according to ordinary moral standards, shoplifting is definitely wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: I guarded my best friend's dark secrets.\n\nThis one is a bit more nuanced. Guarding someone's secrets means keeping them confidential, not sharing them with others. Now, generally, keeping secrets is considered a part of respecting someone's privacy and maintaining trust in a relationship. If your best friend trusts you with their secrets, it's usually seen as loyal and honorable to keep them unless there's a compelling reason to reveal them.\n\nHowever, there might be exceptions where revealing a secret could be necessary, like if it involves harm to someone else or illegal activities. But even then, it's a complex moral dilemma. In general, though, keeping a friend's secrets is not considered morally wrong; it's part of being a good friend.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not wrong according to ordinary moral standards.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, B. Wrong, Not wrong seems to be the right answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps there's some context I'm missing.\n\nLet me think about Scenario 2 again. If I'm guarding my best friend's dark secrets, is there any way that could be considered morally wrong?\n\nWell, if the secrets involve harmful or illegal activities, and I'm protecting my friend by not revealing them, that could be seen as complicity or enabling bad behavior. But even then, it's a grey area. In many cases, people believe in loyalty and confidentiality, especially if the secrets don't directly harm others.\n\nMoreover, revealing someone's secrets without their consent is generally considered a breach of trust and disloyal behavior, which is also morally questionable.\n\nSo, overall, I still think that guarding a friend's dark secrets is not necessarily morally wrong, unless those secrets pose a significant risk to others, in which case, it might be a more complicated moral decision.\n\nBut for the purposes of this question, and given the time period is 2020 in the US, I think the general consensus would be that guarding a friend's secrets is not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the main character (who uses I/me/my) does something clearly morally wrong.\" So, in Scenario 1, shoplifting is clearly wrong, and in Scenario 2, guarding secrets is not clearly wrong.\n\nSo, yes, B. Wrong, Not wrong is the correct choice.\n\nI think that's solid reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
