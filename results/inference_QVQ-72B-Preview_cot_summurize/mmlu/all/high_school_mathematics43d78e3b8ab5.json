                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that I have a rectangle with a length of \\(3x\\) inches and a width of \\(x + 5\\) inches. The area of this rectangle is equal to its perimeter. I need to find the value of \\(x\\). The options are A. 1, B. 5, C. \\(\\frac{10}{3}\\), D. \\(\\frac{3}{10}\\).\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall the formulas for the area and perimeter of a rectangle. I know that the area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width. So, for this rectangle, the area should be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = 3x \\times (x + 5)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying that, I get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = 3x(x + 5) = 3x^2 + 15x\n\\]\n\nNext, the perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the perimeter formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width}) = 2 \\times (3x + x + 5)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2(4x + 5) = 8x + 10\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, the area equals the perimeter:\n\n\\[\n3x^2 + 15x = 8x + 10\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to solve this equation for \\(x\\). Let's move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\[\n3x^2 + 15x - 8x - 10 = 0 \\\\\n3x^2 + 7x - 10 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation: \\(3x^2 + 7x - 10 = 0\\). I can try to factor this or use the quadratic formula. Let's see if it factors nicely.\n\nI need two numbers that multiply to \\(3 \\times (-10) = -30\\) and add up to 7. Hmm, 10 and -3 would work because \\(10 \\times -3 = -30\\) and \\(10 + (-3) = 7\\).\n\nSo, I can write the equation as:\n\n\\[\n3x^2 + 10x - 3x - 10 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, factor by grouping:\n\n\\[\nx(3x + 10) - 1(3x + 10) = 0 \\\\\n(x - 1)(3x + 10) = 0\n\\]\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives the possible solutions for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx - 1 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 3x + 10 = 0 \\\\\nx = 1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = -\\frac{10}{3}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, but \\(x\\) is a dimension in inches, so it has to be positive. A negative dimension doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, \\(x = 1\\) is the valid solution.\n\nLet me check this by plugging \\(x = 1\\) back into the original dimensions.\n\nLength: \\(3(1) = 3\\) inches\n\nWidth: \\(1 + 5 = 6\\) inches\n\nArea: \\(3 \\times 6 = 18\\) square inches\n\nPerimeter: \\(2(3 + 6) = 18\\) inches\n\nYes, they match!\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check \\(x = -\\frac{10}{3}\\):\n\nLength: \\(3\\left(-\\frac{10}{3}\\right) = -10\\) inches\n\nWidth: \\(-\\frac{10}{3} + 5 = \\frac{-10 + 15}{3} = \\frac{5}{3}\\) inches\n\nArea: \\(-10 \\times \\frac{5}{3} = -\\frac{50}{3}\\) square inches\n\nPerimeter: \\(2\\left(-10 + \\frac{5}{3}\\right) = 2\\left(-\\frac{25}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{50}{3}\\) inches\n\nAgain, the area and perimeter have the same numerical value, but negative dimensions don't make physical sense. Therefore, \\(x = 1\\) is the only valid solution.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the problem purely mathematically without considering physical meaning, \\(x = -\\frac{10}{3}\\) could be considered a solution, but given the context of dimensions, it's not feasible.\n\nSo, the correct answer is \\(x = 1\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
