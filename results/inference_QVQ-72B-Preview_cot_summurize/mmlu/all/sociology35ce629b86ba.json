The options are A. Functionalism, B. Interactionism, C. Rational-choice theory, D. Conflict theory.\"\n\nHmm, I need to recall what each of these theories is about, especially which one emphasizes maintaining order and stability in society by carrying out necessary activities.\n\nLet me start by remembering what functionalism is. I think functionalism is a sociological theory that sees society as a complex system whose parts work together to promote solidarity and stability. It's like society is an organism, and each part has a function to keep the whole thing running smoothly. So, if I'm correct, functionalism would focus on how different social institutions, like family, education, and government, contribute to maintaining social order and stability.\n\nInteractionism, or symbolic interactionism, on the other hand, is more about how people interpret and make sense of their social world through everyday interactions. It's about the meanings people attach to things and how they communicate those meanings. So, it's less about maintaining order and more about understanding social life through the lens of individual interactions and meanings.\n\nRational-choice theory is another option. This one is about individuals making choices based on their self-interest, and how those individual choices can lead to social outcomes. It's often used in economics and political science. While it does involve decision-making that can affect society, it's not primarily focused on maintaining order and stability in the same way that functionalism is.\n\nThen there's conflict theory, which is based on the idea that society is characterized by inequality and conflict over resources. It suggests that social change and progress come from struggles between different social classes or groups. So, this theory is more about tension and change rather than maintaining order and stability.\n\nGiven these recollections, it seems like functionalism is the theory that best fits the description of focusing on how society manages to carry out necessary activities to maintain order and stability.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about it a bit more. Maybe there's another theory that also touches on this idea.\n\nFor example, rational-choice theory could indirectly contribute to stability if people make choices that align with societal norms for their own benefit. But this seems more about individual rationality shaping social outcomes rather than directly aiming to maintain order and stability.\n\nInteractionism, while important for understanding social life, doesn't directly address the maintenance of order and stability in society as a whole.\n\nConflict theory, by emphasizing struggle and inequality, might see order and stability as temporary conditions interrupted by conflicts over power and resources.\n\nTherefore, among the given options, functionalism seems to be the most fitting answer because it explicitly focuses on how social systems maintain order and stability through the interrelated functions of various social institutions.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider the core principles of each theory again:\n\n- **Functionalism:** Emphasizes the interdependence of social institutions and their contribution to social stability.\n\n- **Interactionism:** Focuses on individual social interactions and the construction of social reality.\n\n- **Rational-choice theory:** Centers on individual decision-making and the aggregation of individual choices to form social outcomes.\n\n- **Conflict theory:** Highlights the role of power and inequality in generating social change through conflict.\n\nGiven these core principles, functionalism is indeed the theory that primarily concerns itself with how society maintains order and stability through the functioning of its various parts.\n\nSo, my final answer is A. Functionalism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Functionalism}} \\]"
