I have this question: \"Choosing 20 people at random from a large lecture class of 400 people is an example of which of the following?\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. random assignment\n\nB. random sampling\n\nC. representative assignment\n\nD. representative sampling\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which one fits best.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand what each term means.\n\nRandom assignment is when you take a group of people or subjects and divide them into groups (like experimental and control groups) in a way that each member has an equal chance of being assigned to any group. It's mostly used in experiments to test cause and effect.\n\nRandom sampling is when you select a subset of people from a larger population in a way that each member has an equal chance of being selected. This is often used to make inferences about the whole population based on the sample.\n\nRepresentative assignment sounds a bit like random assignment but maybe with the intent to make sure the groups are representative of the population. But I'm not sure if that's a standard term.\n\nRepresentative sampling seems like selecting a sample that mirrors the characteristics of the larger population. This is important to ensure that the sample is unbiased and can accurately reflect the population.\n\nSo, in this scenario, we're choosing 20 people at random from a class of 400. That sounds a lot like random sampling because we're selecting a subset from a larger group where each member has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nRandom assignment would involve assigning some sort of treatment or condition to these 20 people, which isn't mentioned here. We're just selecting 20 people, not assigning them to different groups for an experiment.\n\nRepresentative assignment isn't a term I'm familiar with, so maybe that's not it.\n\nRepresentative sampling, on the other hand, is about ensuring that the sample reflects the population's characteristics. However, in this case, since we're selecting at random, the sample should be representative if the selection is truly random. But the term \"representative sampling\" might imply that we've taken steps to ensure representation, perhaps through stratified sampling or something similar.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about this differently. Is there a difference between random sampling and representative sampling?\n\nRandom sampling is just selecting a sample randomly, and if the sample is large enough and truly random, it should be representative of the population. Representative sampling, I think, might involve taking extra steps to ensure that the sample represents the population's characteristics, maybe by weighting certain subgroups.\n\nIn this scenario, we're just choosing 20 people at random, without any stratification or weighting. So, it's a simple random sample.\n\nTherefore, the best answer should be B. random sampling.\n\nLet me double-check. If I pick 20 people at random from 400, that's random sampling. Unless there's something else going on, like different strata in the population that need to be represented proportionally, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. random sampling.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
