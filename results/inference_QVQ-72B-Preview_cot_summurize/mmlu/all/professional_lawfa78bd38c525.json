The widower lived in a farmhouse on the lemon grove and used the property to raise produce. Adjoining the lemon grove directly to the west was a 10-acre farm that was owned in fee simple by a farmer. There was a four-lane highway that adjoined the lemon grove directly to the east. The widower, by way of gift, executed a deed naming his daughter as grantee. The deed granted to the daughter and her heirs an antebellum mansion located near the southern edge of the lemon grove. The antebellum mansion was accessible by a little- used road that ran west to east from the farmlgrove border to the four-lane highway along the southern boundary of the grove. The daughter recorded her deed and took immediate possession of the property. A short while later, the daughter and the farmer fell in love and began seeing each other quite frequently. In order for the farmer to reach the daughter's house, it was necessary for him to travel over the little-used road across the lemon grove. Many years later, the farmer, who was still having an affair with the daughter, met her father at a Rotary Club meeting. They struck up a conversation, and the widower asked the farmer, \"Have you been driving your pickup along that little-used back road on my property?\" The farmer, who was afraid to tell the widower about his love affair with the daughter, responded with a half-truth, \"Yes, I've been using it as a shortcut to the four-lane highway. \" Unaware that the farmer was also using the path to get to the antebellum mansion to see the daughter, the widower said, \"No problem, I just wanted to be sure that it was you who was using the road. \"Thereafter, the widower found out about his daughter's relationship with the farmer. Infuriated, the widower confronted the farmer and told him, \"Listen, you lying sneak, if I catch you on my property again, I'm going to have you arrested for trespass. \" The farmer replied, \"Sorry, Pops, but I've acquired an easement over that roadway, and I'll continue to use it anytime I want. \"Then, the widower institutes an appropriate action to enjoin the farmer from using the roadway across the lemon grove.

                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out why the widower would prevail in inhibiting the farmer from using the roadway across his lemon grove. The options are that the farmer's use was fraudulent, permissive, not continuous, or not open and notorious. Let me try to wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the setup. There's a widower who owns a 30-acre lemon grove in a suburb. He lives in a farmhouse on the property and uses it to grow produce. Next to his grove, to the west, is a 10-acre farm owned by another farmer. To the east of the lemon grove is a four-lane highway. The widower gives his daughter an antebellum mansion located near the southern edge of the lemon grove. This mansion is accessible via a little-used road that runs from the western border of the grove to the highway along the southern boundary.\n\nThe daughter records her deed and takes possession of the mansion. Later, she starts dating the neighboring farmer. For the farmer to reach the daughter's house, he needs to drive over this little-used road across the lemon grove. The widower eventually finds out that the farmer has been using this road and confronts him about it. The farmer claims he has an easement over the roadway, but the widower threatens to have him arrested for trespassing if he uses it again. The widower then files a lawsuit to prevent the farmer from using the roadway.\n\nNow, the question is, if the widower prevails, it's because the farmer's use of the roadway was:\n\nA. fraudulent.\n\nB. permissive.\n\nC. not continuous.\n\nD. not open and notorious.\n\nI think this has to do with easements by prescription. In property law, an easement by prescription can be acquired through long, continuous, and open use without the owner's permission. The requirements for an easement by prescription typically include:\n\n1. Adverse use: The use must be without the permission of the owner and against the owner's rights.\n\n2. Open and notorious: The use must be obvious to anyone, including the property owner.\n\n3. Continuous and uninterrupted: The use must be regular and persistent over a certain period, often defined by statute.\n\n4. Exclusive: The user must act as if they have the right to use the property.\n\nGiven that, let's see how the farmer's use fits into these criteria.\n\nFirst, was the farmer's use adverse? Initially, when he started using the road to visit the daughter, he might have had permission from the widower, but it seems like there was some confusion.\n\nIn the conversation between the widower and the farmer, the widower asks if the farmer has been using the road as a shortcut to the highway. The farmer says yes and the widower says it's okay, as long as it's the farmer using it. But later, when the widower finds out about the affair, he revokes any implied permission and threatens to arrest the farmer for trespassing.\n\nSo, initially, there might have been some permissive use, but the farmer continued to use the road even after permission was revoked.\n\nNow, for an easement by prescription, if the use starts as permissive but then continues without permission after permission is revoked, does that affect the claim to the easement?\n\nI think that if the use begins permissively but then continues adversely, it can still ripen into a prescriptive easement, but the period of adverse use needs to meet the required statutory period.\n\nBut in this case, the farmer admits to using the road as a shortcut, which might have been open and notorious, but the widower was aware of it and didn't object initially.\n\nWait, but the widower says, \"No problem, I just wanted to be sure that it was you who was using the road. Thereafter, the widower found out about his daughter's relationship with the farmer. Infuriated, the widower confronted the farmer and told him, 'Listen, you lying sneak, if I catch you on my property again, I'm going to have you arrested for trespass.'\"\n\nSo, it seems like initially, the widower was aware of the farmer using the road and didn't object, but later, when he found out about the affair, he revoked any permission.\n\nNow, if the farmer's use was initially permissive, that period might not count toward the prescriptive period. Only the period after permission was revoked would count toward the prescriptive period.\n\nBut, the farmer has been using the road for many years, according to the scenario. If the prescriptive period has been met during the time when the use was adverse (after permission was revoked), then he might have a claim.\n\nHowever, the question is, why does the widower prevail? It's because the farmer's use was...\n\nOption A: fraudulent.\n\nWas the farmer's use fraudulent? Fraudulent use would imply that the farmer was intentionally deceiving the widower about his use of the road.\n\nIn the conversation, the farmer tells the widower that he's using the road as a shortcut to the highway, which is a half-truth because he's also using it to visit the daughter. But is that fraud? Maybe not directly, unless the widower explicitly said that the farmer could use the road only as a shortcut and not to visit the daughter.\n\nOption B: permissive.\n\nThe use was permissive. Well, initially, it seems like the widower gave permission for the farmer to use the road. So, if the use was permissive, that would mean that the farmer doesn't have a prescriptive easement because prescriptive easements require adverse use, not permissive use.\n\nOption C: not continuous.\n\nIf the use wasn't continuous, that would affect the prescriptive period. An easement by prescription requires continuous and uninterrupted use for the statutory period.\n\nOption D: not open and notorious.\n\nIf the use wasn't open and notorious, meaning it wasn't obvious to the property owner, that could also prevent the acquisition of a prescriptive easement.\n\nGiven the scenario, let's see which one fits.\n\nThe widower was aware that the farmer was using the road, as they discussed it at the Rotary Club meeting. The widower said, \"Yes, I've been using it as a shortcut to the four-lane highway.\" So, the use was open and notorious because the widower knew about it.\n\nBut, the widower gave permission for the farmer to use the road, thinking it was just as a shortcut. He didn't know that the farmer was also using it to visit the daughter.\n\nSo, was the use permissive or adverse?\n\nInitially, permissive, but when the widower found out about the affair and revoked permission, the use became adverse.\n\nBut, for the prescriptive period, only the time after revocation would count toward adverse use.\n\nIf the farmer had been using the road for many years, but only a portion of that time was after permission was revoked, then maybe the total adverse use period isn't sufficient to meet the prescriptive period.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the widower's initial permission covered the entire period, and thus the use was permissive, not adverse.\n\nBut, in property law, once permission is revoked, any continued use is adverse.\n\nSo, if the farmer continued to use the road after permission was revoked, that use is adverse and can contribute to a prescriptive easement.\n\nBut, in this scenario, the widower found out about the affair and confronted the farmer, revoking permission.\n\nSo, any use after that point would be adverse.\n\nBut, if the farmer had been using the road for many years, and the period after revocation is sufficient to meet the prescriptive period, then he might have a claim.\n\nUnless, perhaps, the initial permissive use taints the entire period, preventing the acquisition of a prescriptive easement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the use wasn't exclusively for the farmer's benefit, but also for accessing the daughter's property, which is owned by the daughter separately.\n\nWait, the daughter owns the mansion and the land it's on, but the road is on the widower's lemon grove.\n\nSo, perhaps there's an argument that the road is necessary for access to the daughter's property, in which case there might be an easement by necessity or some other type of easement.\n\nBut, the daughter has a recorded deed to the mansion, and presumably, she has access via the road.\n\nUnless there's another way to access the mansion, like perhaps from the western border through the farmer's land, but the scenario says the road runs from the western border of the grove to the highway along the southern boundary.\n\nSo, perhaps the daughter's property is landlocked, and she needs an easement over the widower's land for access.\n\nIn that case, there might be an implied easement of necessity or some other easement that allows her to access her property.\n\nBut, the farmer is trying to claim a prescriptive easement for his own use of the road.\n\nSo, perhaps the widower prevails because the farmer's use was permissive, meaning he had permission to use the road, at least initially, and thus the use wasn't adverse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the use wasn't open and notorious because the widower didn't know about the full extent of the farmer's use (i.e., visiting the daughter).\n\nBut, the widower did know that the farmer was using the road, as they discussed it at the Rotary Club meeting.\n\nSo, it seems like the use was open and notorious.\n\nPerhaps the key is that the use was permissive, at least initially, and thus doesn't qualify as adverse use for prescriptive purposes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the use was fraudulent because the farmer was lying about his reasons for using the road.\n\nIn the conversation, the farmer told the widower that he was using the road as a shortcut to the highway, which was a half-truth because he was also using it to visit the daughter.\n\nBut, is that fraud? It's tricky. Maybe not outright fraud, but perhaps misrepresentation.\n\nIn property law, fraud typically involves intentional deception that induces someone to act to their detriment.\n\nHere, the widower might have allowed the farmer to use the road based on the farmer's statement that he was using it as a shortcut, not knowing that he was also using it to visit the daughter.\n\nIf the widower would not have allowed the use had he known the full extent, then perhaps there's an argument for fraud or misrepresentation.\n\nBut, I'm not sure if that's strong enough to invalidate the farmer's claim to a prescriptive easement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the widower prevails because the farmer's use wasn't continuous.\n\nMaybe the farmer wasn't using the road regularly enough to meet the requirement of continuous use.\n\nBut, the scenario says the farmer was using it quite frequently, so it's likely that the use was continuous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the use wasn't exclusive, since the daughter also had a right to use the road to access her property.\n\nBut, the farmer is trying to claim an easement for his own use, separate from the daughter's rights.\n\nSo, maybe the widower prevails because the farmer's use wasn't exclusive.\n\nBut, the options don't include \"not exclusive,\" so perhaps that's not the answer.\n\nGiven the options, I need to choose among A, B, C, or D.\n\nOption A: fraudulent.\n\nOption B: permissive.\n\nOption C: not continuous.\n\nOption D: not open and notorious.\n\nGiven that the widower knew about the farmer's use and initially gave permission, which was later revoked, perhaps the key is that the use was permissive.\n\nIn prescriptive easements, permissive use generally doesn't count toward the required period of adverse use.\n\nSo, if the farmer's use was permissive, even if he continued to use the road after permission was revoked, the period before revocation might not count toward the prescriptive period.\n\nTherefore, the widower prevails because the farmer's use was permissive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the use was fraudulent because the farmer was not fully disclosing his reasons for using the road.\n\nBut, I think permissive use is a stronger ground here.\n\nSo, my answer would be B. permissive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
