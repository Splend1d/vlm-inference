                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a theater group with eight members: four females and four males. We need to assign roles for a play that include one female lead, one male lead, and three other roles that can be played by either gender. We need to find out how many different ways we can assign these roles.\n\nFirst, let's understand the roles:\n\n1. One female lead\n\n2. One male lead\n\n3. Three other roles (these can be played by either gender)\n\nSo, we have a total of five roles to fill: female lead, male lead, and three others.\n\nWait a minute, but the group has eight members: four females and four males. So, the female lead must be one of the four females, and the male lead must be one of the four males.\n\nNow, for the three remaining roles that can be played by either gender, we need to be careful not to double-count or miss any assignments.\n\nLet me think about this systematically.\n\nStep 1: Assign the female lead.\n\nThere are four females, so there are 4 choices for the female lead.\n\nStep 2: Assign the male lead.\n\nThere are four males, so there are 4 choices for the male lead.\n\nStep 3: Assign the three remaining roles.\n\nThese three roles can be played by anyone from the remaining members. After assigning the female and male leads, there are 8 - 2 = 6 members left.\n\nWait, but we have to choose 3 out of these 6 members and assign them to the three roles. Since the roles are distinct (I assume they are different objects, so order matters), this is a permutation of 6 members taken 3 at a time.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 members out of 6 and assign them to 3 distinct roles is P(6,3) = 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 = 120.\n\nSo, total number of ways would be:\n\nNumber of ways = (number of choices for female lead) \u00d7 (number of choices for male lead) \u00d7 (number of ways to assign the three roles)\n\nNumber of ways = 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 120 = 1920\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 640\n\nB. 720\n\nC. 8\n\nD. 1920\n\nSo, 1920 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can think of it as assigning five distinct roles: female lead, male lead, role A, role B, and role C (where A, B, and C can be played by anyone).\n\nBut in this case, the three \"other\" roles are specified as different objects, but in the problem, it says \"three different objects that can be played by either gender.\"\n\nSo, perhaps the three roles are distinct, but they are specified as \"objects,\" which might imply that they are specific roles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the three roles are not distinct, but that seems unlikely because they are described as \"different objects.\"\n\nAssuming they are distinct, then my initial approach is correct: assign female lead, male lead, and then assign three distinct roles from the remaining six members.\n\nThus, 4 (female lead) \u00d7 4 (male lead) \u00d7 P(6,3) = 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 120 = 1920.\n\nAlternatively, if the three roles were not distinct, but just three members to be chosen regardless of the role, it would be C(6,3) = 20 ways for the three roles, and total ways would be 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 20 = 320.\n\nBut given that the problem says \"three different objects,\" I think it's safe to assume that the roles are distinct, so P(6,3) = 120 is the correct approach.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways is 1920.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1920} \\]"
