                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question about Hersey and Blanchard's situational leadership model. I need to figure out when a leader should use a \"participative\" style based on the subordinates' ability and motivation levels. The options are:\n\nA. low ability and low motivation.\n\nB. low ability and high motivation.\n\nC. high ability and low motivation.\n\nD. high ability and high motivation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the situational leadership model is all about. I remember that this model suggests that the effective leadership style depends on the maturity level of the subordinates. Maturity here refers to their ability and willingness to take responsibility.\n\nAbility is about their skill set and knowledge to do the job, while motivation is about their willingness and confidence to do it. So, maturity is a combination of these two.\n\nThe model has four leadership styles:\n\n1. Telling (S1): High direction, low support.\n\n2. Selling (S2): High direction, high support.\n\n3. Participating (S3): Low direction, high support.\n\n4. Delegating (S4): Low direction, low support.\n\nEach style is meant for different levels of maturity in the subordinates.\n\nLet me recall the maturity levels:\n\n- M1: Low maturity \u2013 low ability and low motivation.\n\n- M2: Some maturity \u2013 low ability but high motivation.\n\n- M3: Comparatively mature \u2013 high ability but low motivation.\n\n- M4: Mature \u2013 high ability and high motivation.\n\nSo, option A corresponds to M1, option B to M2, option C to M3, and option D to M4.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the situation where a participative style should be used. Participative is S3, which is low direction and high support.\n\nAccording to the model, S3 is appropriate for M3, which is high ability but low motivation.\n\nSo, that would be option C: high ability and low motivation.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I'm not mixing things up.\n\nOption A: low ability and low motivation \u2013 that's M1, which typically requires a telling style (S1).\n\nOption B: low ability and high motivation \u2013 M2, which needs selling style (S2).\n\nOption C: high ability and low motivation \u2013 M3, which is participative style (S3).\n\nOption D: high ability and high motivation \u2013 M4, which is delegating style (S4).\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think the correct answer is option C.\n\nWait a minute, I should consider if there's any exception or special case that might make another option seem plausible. For example, if subordinates have high ability and low motivation, maybe a participative style could help increase their motivation by involving them in decisions.\n\nBut according to the model, S3 is indeed for M3, which is high ability and low motivation.\n\nAlternatively, for low ability and high motivation (M2), the selling style involves both direction and support, which might also involve some participation, but the primary focus is on providing clear directions due to their low ability.\n\nFor high ability and high motivation (M4), delegating is appropriate because they can handle the job independently.\n\nFor low ability and low motivation (M1), telling is necessary to provide clear instructions and closely supervise since they lack both ability and motivation.\n\nSo, in this context, participative style is best suited for those with high ability and low motivation.\n\nI think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
