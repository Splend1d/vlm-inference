                    "text": "So I have this problem here about a capacitor. It says that there's a 30 millifarad capacitor with 6 milliocoulombs of charge on each plate, and I need to find the energy stored in it. The options are A. 5.4 \u00d7 10\u201310 J, B. 9.0 \u00d7 10\u20138 J, C. 0.6 J, and D. 12.5 J.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor. I remember that the energy (U) stored in a capacitor is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{1}{2} C V^2 \\]\n\nwhere C is the capacitance and V is the voltage across the capacitor. But in this problem, I don't know the voltage. However, I do know the charge (Q) on the plates, and I know that:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{Q}{C} \\]\n\nSo, maybe I can substitute V in the energy formula with Q/C.\n\nLet me try that:\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{1}{2} C \\left( \\frac{Q}{C} \\right)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{1}{2} C \\left( \\frac{Q^2}{C^2} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{Q^2}{C} \\]\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{Q^2}{2C} \\]\n\nOkay, that seems simpler. So, if I have Q and C, I can plug them into this formula to find U.\n\nLet me make sure I have the units right. Q is in coulombs, C is in farads, and U should come out in joules.\n\nGiven that, Q is 6 milliocoulombs. Milli means 10^-3, so:\n\n\\[ Q = 6 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{C} \\]\n\nC is 30 millifarads. Milli means 10^-3 again, so:\n\n\\[ C = 30 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{F} \\]\n\nNow, plugging these into the formula:\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{(6 \\times 10^{-3})^2}{2 \\times (30 \\times 10^{-3})} \\]\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{36 \\times 10^{-6}}{60 \\times 10^{-3}} \\]\n\nWait, let me calculate that properly.\n\nFirst, square of Q:\n\n\\[ Q^2 = (6 \\times 10^{-3})^2 = 36 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{C}^2 \\]\n\nThen, 2 times C:\n\n\\[ 2C = 2 \\times 30 \\times 10^{-3} = 60 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{F} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{36 \\times 10^{-6}}{60 \\times 10^{-3}} \\]\n\nTo divide these, I can subtract the exponents:\n\n\\[ U = 36 \\div 60 \\times 10^{-6 + 3} \\]\n\n\\[ U = 0.6 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\n\\[ U = 0.6 \\, \\text{mJ} \\]\n\nBut wait, the options are in joules, not millijoules. So, 0.6 mJ is equal to 0.6 \u00d7 10^{-3} J, which is 0.0006 J. Looking at the options, 0.6 J is option C, but that's different from what I have.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's double-check the division.\n\nWe have:\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{36 \\times 10^{-6}}{60 \\times 10^{-3}} \\]\n\nFirst, divide 36 by 60:\n\n\\[ 36 \\div 60 = 0.6 \\]\n\nThen, subtract the exponents of 10:\n\n\\[ 10^{-6} \\div 10^{-3} = 10^{-6 + 3} = 10^{-3} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ U = 0.6 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{J} = 0.6 \\, \\text{mJ} \\]\n\nBut option C is 0.6 J, which is 600 mJ, not 0.6 mJ. There must be a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should not convert to millijoules and just keep it in joules.\n\nLet me recast the calculation:\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{36 \\times 10^{-6}}{60 \\times 10^{-3}} \\]\n\nAlternatively,\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{36}{60} \\times \\frac{10^{-6}}{10^{-3}} \\]\n\n\\[ U = 0.6 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\n\\[ U = 0.6 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{J} = 0.0006 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nBut 0.0006 J is not matching any of the options directly. Maybe I need to express it in scientific notation.\n\n0.0006 J is the same as 6 \u00d7 10^{-4} J. None of the options match this value. Option C is 0.6 J, which is 6 \u00d7 10^{-1} J, which is much larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I have the formula wrong. Let me check the energy formula again.\n\nThe standard formula for energy stored in a capacitor is indeed:\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{1}{2} C V^2 \\]\n\nOr, equivalently,\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{1}{2} Q V \\]\n\nOr,\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{Q^2}{2C} \\]\n\nI think I used the correct formula. Maybe I made a mistake in the units.\n\nLet me check the units:\n\nQ is in coulombs (C),\n\nC is in farads (F),\n\nU should be in joules (J).\n\nYes, the formula \\( U = \\frac{Q^2}{2C} \\) gives U in joules when Q is in coulombs and C is in farads.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different formula that's more appropriate here.\n\nWait, another formula for energy stored in a capacitor is:\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{1}{2} Q V \\]\n\nBut since V = Q/C, I can substitute that in, which would bring me back to the same expression.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the voltage directly. Let me find the voltage first.\n\nGiven Q and C, voltage V is:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{Q}{C} = \\frac{6 \\times 10^{-3}}{30 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{6}{30} \\times \\frac{10^{-3}}{10^{-3}} = 0.2 \\, \\text{V} \\]\n\nThen, energy U is:\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{1}{2} C V^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 30 \\times 10^{-3} \\times (0.2)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ U = 15 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 0.04 \\]\n\n\\[ U = 15 \\times 0.04 \\times 10^{-3} \\]\n\n\\[ U = 0.6 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{J} = 0.0006 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nAgain, the same result. So, according to my calculations, the energy should be 0.6 mJ, which is 0.0006 J.\n\nBut none of the options match this value directly. Option C is 0.6 J, which is 600 mJ, which is way larger than what I calculated.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options provided. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the units.\n\nLet me double-check the units. The problem says:\n\n\"A 30 mF capacitor has 6 mC of charge on each plate.\"\n\nmF is millifarads, which is 10^-3 farads, and mC is milliocoulombs, which is 10^-3 coulombs. So, I think I have the conversions correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use different units, but that doesn't seem likely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that \"m\" in mF and mC could be misread, but assuming standard notation, m is milli-.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the capacitor has a different capacitance or charge. Let me check the calculations with the given values.\n\nGiven C = 30 mF = 30 \u00d7 10^-3 F = 0.03 F\n\nQ = 6 mC = 6 \u00d7 10^-3 C\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{Q^2}{2C} = \\frac{(6 \\times 10^{-3})^2}{2 \\times 0.03} = \\frac{36 \\times 10^{-6}}{0.06} = 36 \\times 10^{-6} \\div 0.06 = 36 \\times 10^{-6} \\times \\frac{1}{0.06} \\]\n\n\\[ U = 36 \\times 10^{-6} \\times \\frac{100}{6} = 36 \\times \\frac{100}{6} \\times 10^{-6} = 6 \\times 100 \\times 10^{-6} = 6 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nWait, I seem to be getting different results now. Let me recalculate carefully.\n\nFirst, calculate Q squared:\n\n\\[ Q^2 = (6 \\times 10^{-3})^2 = 36 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{C}^2 \\]\n\nThen, 2C is:\n\n\\[ 2C = 2 \\times 30 \\times 10^{-3} = 60 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{F} \\]\n\nNow, divide:\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{36 \\times 10^{-6}}{60 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{36}{60} \\times 10^{-6 + 3} = 0.6 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{J} = 0.6 \\, \\text{mJ} = 0.0006 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nStill getting the same result. Maybe there's an error in the problem or the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the charge is 6 microcoulombs instead of milliocoulombs. Sometimes, in capacitors, charges are in microcoulombs (\u03bcC), not milliocoulombs (mC). If that's the case, then Q = 6 \u03bcC = 6 \u00d7 10^-6 C.\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{(6 \\times 10^{-6})^2}{2 \\times 30 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{36 \\times 10^{-12}}{60 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{36}{60} \\times 10^{-12 + 3} = 0.6 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{J} = 0.6 \\, \\text{nJ} \\]\n\nBut this is not among the options either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the capacitance is 30 microfarads (\u03bcF), which is 30 \u00d7 10^-6 F.\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{(6 \\times 10^{-3})^2}{2 \\times 30 \\times 10^{-6}} = \\frac{36 \\times 10^{-6}}{60 \\times 10^{-6}} = \\frac{36}{60} = 0.6 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nWait, that's option C.\n\nSo, if C is 30 \u03bcF instead of 30 mF, then the energy would be 0.6 J.\n\nPerhaps there's a typo in the problem, and it should be 30 \u03bcF instead of 30 mF.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the charge is 6 \u03bcC instead of 6 mC.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nIf Q = 6 \u03bcC = 6 \u00d7 10^-6 C and C = 30 mF = 30 \u00d7 10^-3 F,\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{(6 \\times 10^{-6})^2}{2 \\times 30 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{36 \\times 10^{-12}}{60 \\times 10^{-3}} = 0.6 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nWhich is 0.6 nJ, not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, if C is 30 \u03bcF = 30 \u00d7 10^-6 F and Q is 6 mC = 6 \u00d7 10^-3 C,\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{(6 \\times 10^{-3})^2}{2 \\times 30 \\times 10^{-6}} = \\frac{36 \\times 10^{-6}}{60 \\times 10^{-6}} = 0.6 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nThis matches option C.\n\nTherefore, it seems likely that there was a typo in the problem, and the capacitance was intended to be 30 \u03bcF instead of 30 mF.\n\nGiven that, the correct energy stored would be 0.6 J, which is option C.\n\nAlternatively, if the capacitance is indeed 30 mF and the charge is 6 mC, then the energy should be 0.0006 J, which isn't listed among the options.\n\nGiven that, I'll assume that the capacitance is 30 \u03bcF, and the correct answer is 0.6 J, option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
