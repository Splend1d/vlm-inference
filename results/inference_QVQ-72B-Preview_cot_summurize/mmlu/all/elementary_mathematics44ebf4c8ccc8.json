                    "text": "Let's see here. Katie is going on vacation for 3 weeks, and she's multiplying 5 times 3 to find out how many days of work she'll miss. So, 5 times 3 is 15, right? That means she's missing 15 days of work. But the question is asking for another way to find the same number.\n\nOkay, so she's multiplying 5 by 3 to get 15. Another way could be to add 5 three times. Let me check the options.\n\nOption A is 3 plus 5. That's 8, which is not 15.\n\nOption B is 3 plus 3 plus 3. That's 9, still not 15.\n\nOption C is 5 plus 5 plus 5. That's 15.\n\nOption D is 5 plus 5 plus 5 plus 5 plus 5. That's 25, which is more than 15.\n\nSo, among these, option C seems correct because 5 plus 5 plus 5 equals 15, which matches the original multiplication of 5 times 3.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about it? Maybe using multiplication again but differently. Like, if she's going on vacation for 3 weeks, and each week has 5 workdays, then yes, 5 times 3 would be 15.\n\nAlternatively, if she's considering something else, but I think the question is straightforward. It's just about finding another expression that equals 15.\n\nLet me consider if there's another approach. Maybe using division or subtraction, but no, those wouldn't make sense in this context. The options are all addition expressions.\n\nSo, sticking to addition, 5 plus 5 plus 5 equals 15, which is the same as 5 times 3.\n\nI don't think there's any other expression among the options that equals 15 besides option C.\n\nWait, option D is 5 plus 5 plus 5 plus 5 plus 5, which is 25. That's 5 times 5, which is different from 5 times 3.\n\nSo, no, that doesn't work.\n\nOption B is 3 plus 3 plus 3, which is 9, which is 3 times 3.\n\nNot matching 15.\n\nOption A is 3 plus 5, which is 8.\n\nAgain, not 15.\n\nSo, clearly, option C is the correct choice.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's a misunderstanding of the problem.\n\nThe problem says: \"Katie is going on vacation for 3 weeks. She finds the number of days of work she will miss by multiplying 5 \u00d7 3. Which expression shows another way Katie can find the number of days of work she will miss?\"\n\nSo, she's multiplying 5 by 3 to get 15.\n\nAnother way could be to add 5 three times, which is what option C does.\n\nAlternatively, if she wanted to add 3 five times, that would be 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3, which is 15, but that's not one of the options.\n\nWait, option B is 3 plus 3 plus 3, which is 9, not 15.\n\nSo, no, that's not correct.\n\nOption C is 5 plus 5 plus 5, which is 15, matching the original 5 times 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option C.\n\nI think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
