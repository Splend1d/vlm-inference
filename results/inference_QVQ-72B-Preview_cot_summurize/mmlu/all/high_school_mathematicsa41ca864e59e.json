                    "text": "So I need to find out how many positive integers are factors of both 120 and 40. In other words, I'm looking for the common factors of 120 and 40. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I can list all the positive factors of 120 and all the positive factors of 40, and then find the ones that are common to both lists. That should give me the answer.\n\nLet me start by finding the factors of 120. Starting from 1 and going up, checking divisibility:\n\n1 divides everything, so 1 is a factor.\n\n2 divides 120 because it's even, so 2 is a factor.\n\n3: 1 + 2 + 0 = 3, which is divisible by 3, so 3 is a factor.\n\n4: 120 divided by 4 is 30, so 4 is a factor.\n\n5: ends with 0, so 5 is a factor.\n\n6: divisible by 2 and 3, so 6 is a factor.\n\n7: let's see, 7 times 17 is 119, so 120 divided by 7 is not an integer, so 7 is not a factor.\n\n8: 120 divided by 8 is 15, so 8 is a factor.\n\n9: 1 + 2 + 0 = 3, which is not divisible by 9, so 9 is not a factor.\n\n10: ends with 0, so 10 is a factor.\n\n11: 120 divided by 11 is approximately 10.909, which is not an integer, so 11 is not a factor.\n\n12: 120 divided by 12 is 10, so 12 is a factor.\n\n13: 120 divided by 13 is about 9.23, not an integer, so 13 is not a factor.\n\n14: 120 divided by 14 is approximately 8.57, not an integer, so 14 is not a factor.\n\n15: 120 divided by 15 is 8, so 15 is a factor.\n\n16: 120 divided by 16 is 7.5, not an integer, so 16 is not a factor.\n\n17: 120 divided by 17 is about 7.058, not an integer, so 17 is not a factor.\n\n18: 120 divided by 18 is about 6.666, not an integer, so 18 is not a factor.\n\n20: 120 divided by 20 is 6, so 20 is a factor.\n\n24: 120 divided by 24 is 5, so 24 is a factor.\n\n30: 120 divided by 30 is 4, so 30 is a factor.\n\n40: 120 divided by 40 is 3, so 40 is a factor.\n\n48: 120 divided by 48 is 2.5, not an integer, so 48 is not a factor.\n\n60: 120 divided by 60 is 2, so 60 is a factor.\n\n80: 120 divided by 80 is 1.5, not an integer, so 80 is not a factor.\n\n120: 120 divided by 120 is 1, so 120 is a factor.\n\nSo the positive factors of 120 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.\n\nNow, let's find the factors of 40.\n\n1 divides everything, so 1 is a factor.\n\n2 divides 40 because it's even, so 2 is a factor.\n\n3: 4 + 0 = 4, which is not divisible by 3, so 3 is not a factor.\n\n4: 40 divided by 4 is 10, so 4 is a factor.\n\n5: ends with 0, so 5 is a factor.\n\n6: 40 divided by 6 is approximately 6.666, not an integer, so 6 is not a factor.\n\n7: 40 divided by 7 is about 5.714, not an integer, so 7 is not a factor.\n\n8: 40 divided by 8 is 5, so 8 is a factor.\n\n9: 4 + 0 = 4, not divisible by 9, so 9 is not a factor.\n\n10: 40 divided by 10 is 4, so 10 is a factor.\n\n11: 40 divided by 11 is about 3.636, not an integer, so 11 is not a factor.\n\n12: 40 divided by 12 is about 3.333, not an integer, so 12 is not a factor.\n\n14: 40 divided by 14 is approximately 2.857, not an integer, so 14 is not a factor.\n\n15: 40 divided by 15 is about 2.666, not an integer, so 15 is not a factor.\n\n16: 40 divided by 16 is 2.5, not an integer, so 16 is not a factor.\n\n20: 40 divided by 20 is 2, so 20 is a factor.\n\n24: 40 divided by 24 is approximately 1.666, not an integer, so 24 is not a factor.\n\n30: 40 divided by 30 is about 1.333, not an integer, so 30 is not a factor.\n\n40: 40 divided by 40 is 1, so 40 is a factor.\n\nSo the positive factors of 40 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40.\n\nNow, I need to find the common factors between the factors of 120 and 40. That means I need to look for numbers that are in both lists.\n\nLooking at both lists:\n\nFactors of 120: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.\n\nFactors of 40: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40.\n\nThe common factors are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40.\n\nWait, hold on. Looking back, in the factors of 120, I have 40, but is 40 a factor of 120? Let me double-check that.\n\n120 divided by 40 is 3, which is an integer, so yes, 40 is a factor of 120.\n\nSimilarly, 40 is also a factor of 40, obviously.\n\nSo, the common factors are indeed 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40.\n\nThat's eight numbers in total.\n\nBut wait, the options given are:\n\nA. 4\n\nB. 8\n\nC. 2\n\nD. 1\n\nSo, according to my calculation, the answer should be B. 8.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, are there any factors of 120 that I might have missed in the list of common factors?\n\nLooking at the factors of 120: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.\n\nAnd factors of 40: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40.\n\nSo, the common ones are indeed 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40.\n\nWait, but is 6 a factor of 40? 40 divided by 6 is approximately 6.666, which is not an integer, so 6 is not a factor of 40.\n\nSimilarly, 12, 15, 24, 30, 60, and 120 are not factors of 40, except for 40 itself.\n\nSo, the common factors are correctly identified as 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 common factors.\n\nBut let me consider if there's a better way to find this without listing all the factors.\n\nI recall that another way to find common factors is to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers and then find all the factors of that GCD.\n\nSo, if I find the GCD of 120 and 40, that should give me the largest number that divides both 120 and 40.\n\nLet me calculate GCD(120,40).\n\n120 divided by 40 is 3 with no remainder, so 40 divides 120 exactly.\n\nTherefore, the GCD is 40.\n\nNow, the factors of 40 are the common factors of 120 and 40.\n\nWait a minute, that seems off.\n\nBecause earlier, I listed the factors of 120 and 40 and found common factors to be 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40, which are eight in total.\n\nBut if I say GCD is 40, then the factors of 40 are indeed 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40, which matches.\n\nSo, this confirms that the number of common factors is eight.\n\nBut wait, is there a possibility that the GCD is 40, but perhaps there are more common factors that I haven't considered?\n\nLet me think about it again.\n\nActually, the GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them.\n\nSo, in this case, since 40 divides both 120 and 40, and it's the largest number that does so, the common factors should indeed be all the factors of 40.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach and the GCD approach both lead to the same conclusion.\n\nThus, the number of positive integers that are factors of both 120 and 40 is 8.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 8.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let me consider if there are any other factors that I might have missed.\n\nLooking back at the factors of 120 and 40:\n\nFactors of 120: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.\n\nFactors of 40: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40.\n\nCommon factors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40.\n\nThat's eight numbers.\n\nI don't see any other numbers that could be common factors.\n\nTherefore, the answer is indeed B. 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
