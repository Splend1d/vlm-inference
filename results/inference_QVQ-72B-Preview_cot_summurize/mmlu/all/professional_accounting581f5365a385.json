                    "text": "Let's see here. So, Holt Co. realized that last year they didn't report $40,000 of depreciation on a building they constructed. But they did calculate it correctly for tax purposes. The tax rate this year is 20%, and I need to figure out how to report the correction of this error in the current year.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. They didn't report $40,000 of depreciation in their financial statements last year, but they did report it for tax purposes. So, their financial statements have an error because they under-depreciated the building by $40,000 last year.\n\nNow, in the current year, they've discovered this error and need to correct it. This sounds like a prior period error, and according to accounting principles, prior period errors are corrected through retained earnings. So, it's not going to be treated as an expense in the current period directly.\n\nBut the question is asking about how to report the correction in the current year. Specifically, it's asking about depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation.\n\nAccumulated depreciation is the total amount of depreciation expense that has been recognized to date for an asset. Since they didn't depreciate $40,000 last year, their accumulated depreciation is $40,000 less than it should be.\n\nSo, to correct this error, they need to adjust the accumulated depreciation account to reflect the correct amount that should have been depreciated up to now.\n\nOption A says \"as an increase in accumulated depreciation of $32,000.\" Hmm, why $32,000? The error is $40,000, but maybe the tax rate affects this amount.\n\nOption B says \"as an increase in accumulated depreciation of $40,000.\" This seems straightforward. Since they under-depreciated by $40,000 last year, they should increase accumulated depreciation by $40,000 to correct it.\n\nOption C says \"as an increase in depreciation expense of $32,000.\" Again, the $32,000 seems to come from the tax rate, perhaps net of tax effect.\n\nOption D says \"as an increase of depreciation expense of $40,000.\" This suggests recognizing the missed depreciation as an expense in the current year.\n\nBut wait, since this is a prior period error, it's not supposed to be recognized as an expense in the current year. Instead, it should be corrected directly to retained earnings.\n\nSo, I think options C and D might not be correct because they suggest recognizing the error as an expense in the current period, which isn't appropriate for a prior period error.\n\nBetween options A and B, option B suggests increasing accumulated depreciation by $40,000, which makes sense because that's the amount they missed depreciating last year.\n\nBut let's think about the tax implications. The depreciation was computed correctly for tax purposes, meaning that for tax calculations, they did take the $40,000 depreciation. So, there's a difference between the financial reporting and tax reporting for depreciation.\n\nIn this case, since the financial statements didn't depreciate the $40,000 last year, but taxes did, there would be a temporary difference that would have been recognized as a deferred tax asset.\n\nNow, in the current year, when they correct this error, they need to adjust the accumulated depreciation by $40,000 and also adjust the deferred tax asset accordingly.\n\nGiven that the tax rate is 20%, the deferred tax asset related to this temporary difference would be $40,000 multiplied by 20%, which is $8,000.\n\nSo, to correct the error, they would:\n\n- Increase accumulated depreciation by $40,000\n\n- Decrease deferred tax asset by $8,000\n\n- The net effect on retained earnings would be a decrease of $32,000 ($40,000 - $8,000)\n\nBut the question is specifically about how to report the correction of the error in the current year, and it's asking about depreciation expense or accumulated depreciation.\n\nGiven that it's a prior period error, the correction should be made directly to retained earnings, and the accounts should be adjusted accordingly.\n\nOption B says \"as an increase in accumulated depreciation of $40,000.\" This seems correct because they need to catch up on the $40,000 they missed last year.\n\nOption A says \"as an increase in accumulated depreciation of $32,000.\" This might be the net amount after considering the tax effect, but I think the adjustment to accumulated depreciation should be the full $40,000, and the tax effect is handled separately.\n\nOption C and D mention increasing depreciation expense, but as I thought earlier, that's not the right approach for a prior period error.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is Option B: as an increase in accumulated depreciation of $40,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
