Let me see what options I have.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"from least to greatest\" means. It means arranging the numbers in ascending order, starting with the smallest number and ending with the largest number.\n\nSo, looking at the numbers: 6, -1, 8, -3, -4.\n\nI know that negative numbers are smaller than positive numbers, and among negative numbers, the one with the larger absolute value is smaller. For example, -4 is smaller than -3 because 4 is larger than 3 in absolute terms.\n\nLet me list the numbers again: 6, -1, 8, -3, -4.\n\nFirst, I should identify the smallest number. Between -4 and -3, -4 is smaller. Then, -3 is next. Then, -1 is larger than -3 and -4. Then, 6 and 8 are positive numbers, so they come after the negatives. Between 6 and 8, 6 is smaller, so 6 comes before 8.\n\nSo, arranging them from least to greatest should be: -4, -3, -1, 6, 8.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6, -1, 8, -3, -4\n\nThis is not correct because it starts with 6, which is one of the larger numbers, and then has -1, which is positive, before the negatives. That doesn't make sense.\n\nB. -4, -3, -1, 6, 8\n\nThis seems correct based on my earlier reasoning.\n\nC. -1, -3, -4, 6, 8\n\nThis is incorrect because -1 is larger than -3 and -4, so it should come after them, not before.\n\nD. -3, -4, 6, -1, 8\n\nThis is also incorrect because it jumps from -3 to -4, then to 6, then back to -1, which isn't in order.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. -4, -3, -1, 6, 8.\n\nJust to double-check:\n\n-4 is the smallest, then -3, then -1, then 6, then 8.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
