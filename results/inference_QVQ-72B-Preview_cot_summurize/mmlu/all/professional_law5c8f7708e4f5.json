Over the course of time, the land development company developed two residential subdivisions of the land, an eastern development and a western development, each of which contained 150 acres. These subdivisions were created by separate plats that made no reference to each other. The restrictions in the plats were, however, substantially identical. The plats and each deed provided that \"the use of the land herein conveyed is restricted to single- family dwellings only, and this covenant is intended to apply to each and every lot in the subdivision and runs with the land, binding every lot owner, his heirs, and assigns. \"After all but four lots in each subdivision had been sold by the land development company, it sold 50 acres of the remaining 100 acres of land to a country club by a deed containing the following provisions:\"This deed is executed and accepted with the understanding that the property above described is hereby restricted so that(1) said property may be used as a country club, with a golf course, pool, tennis courts, club house, eating facilities, and other improvements appropriate to a country club.

The options are fee simple determinable, fee simple subject to condition subsequent, determinable fee subject to an executory interest, and easement appurtenant. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the background. There's a 400-acre tract owned by a land development company. They developed two residential subdivisions, each 150 acres, with restrictions for single-family dwellings only. These restrictions are meant to apply to every lot and run with the land, binding future owners.\n\nNow, after selling all but four lots in each subdivision, the company sells 50 acres to a country club. The deed has specific provisions:\n\n1. The property can be used as a country club with various amenities like a golf course, pool, tennis courts, clubhouse, etc.\n\n2. The property can also be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern development, and then used in accordance with and conveyed subject to residential restrictions that conform with those in force against the eastern development.\n\n3. The restrictions are covenants running with the land, and for any breach of these covenants, the grantor (the land development company) or its successors and assigns may, at their option, re-enter and terminate the estate conveyed.\n\nAdditionally, the land development company retained title to the remaining 50 acres of the original 400-acre tract.\n\nAlright, so the country club has purchased this 50-acre tract with these specific uses and restrictions. I need to determine what kind of property interest this constitutes.\n\nLet's recall some basic property law concepts:\n\n- **Fee simple determinable:** This is an estate that will automatically terminate upon the occurrence of a specified event, without any action required by the grantor. The typical phrase is \"so long as\" or \"during good behavior.\"\n\n- **Fee simple subject to condition subsequent:** This is an estate that may be terminated by the grantor if a specified condition is violated. The grantor has the option to enforce the condition by taking action, such as bringing a lawsuit to reclaim the property.\n\n- **Determinable fee subject to an executory interest:** This is similar to a fee simple determinable, where the estate terminates automatically upon the occurrence of the specified event, and another interest springs up, usually in the grantor or their heirs.\n\n- **Easement appurtenant:** This is a right to use another's land for a specific purpose, typically benefiting a particular piece of land (the dominant tenement) over another (the servient tenement).\n\nGiven that the country club has purchased a tract of land with specific uses and restrictions, and that there's a provision allowing the grantor to re-enter and terminate the estate in case of a breach of the covenants, it seems like the interest is subject to conditions that can be enforced by the grantor.\n\nLet me look closer at the deed provisions:\n\n- The property can be used as a country club with specified amenities.\n\n- Alternatively, it can be subdivided and used under residential restrictions conforming to those in the eastern development.\n\n- There's a covenant running with the land, and upon breach, the grantor has the option to re-enter and terminate the estate.\n\nFrom this, it appears that the use of the property is conditional, and the grantor has the right to terminate the estate if the conditions are violated. This sounds like a fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\n\nIn a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, the grantor retains the right to reclaim the property if the condition is breached, but the termination is not automatic; it requires the grantor to take affirmative action.\n\nOn the other hand, a fee simple determinable would have the estate terminate automatically without any action by the grantor upon the occurrence of the specified event.\n\nGiven that the deed specifically states that the grantor \"may, at its option, re-enter and terminate the estate,\" it suggests that the termination is not automatic but depends on the grantor's decision to enforce the condition.\n\nTherefore, this seems more aligned with a fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any indication of a determinable fee subject to an executory interest.\n\nA determinable fee subject to an executory interest involves the estate terminating automatically upon the occurrence of a specified event, and another interest springs up, usually in the grantor or their heirs.\n\nIn this case, the termination is contingent on the grantor's decision to enforce the condition, which again points towards a fee simple subject to condition subsequent rather than a determinable fee.\n\nAn easement appurtenant doesn't seem applicable here because that would involve a right to use another's land, whereas the country club is purchasing a tract of land, not acquiring a right over someone else's land.\n\nSo, between the options given:\n\nA. Fee simple determinable.\n\nB. Fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\n\nC. Determinable fee subject to an executory interest.\n\nD. Easement appurtenant.\n\nThe most accurate description appears to be B. Fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about the characteristics:\n\n- The country club has absolute ownership of the property, subject to the conditions specified in the deed.\n\n- If they violate the conditions, the grantor has the option to terminate the estate.\n\n- The termination is not automatic; it requires action by the grantor.\n\nThis fits the definition of a fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
