                    "text": "So I need to find the degree of the field extension \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\). The options are 0, 4, 2, and 6. Hmm, 0 doesn't make much sense because \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\) is definitely larger than \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), so it can't have degree 0. Let's see the others.\n\nFirst, I should recall that the degree of a field extension is the dimension of the larger field as a vector space over the smaller field. So, \\( [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) : \\mathbb{Q}] \\) is the dimension of \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\) as a vector space over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\).\n\nI know that \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\) is the smallest field containing \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), \\( \\sqrt{2} \\), and \\( \\sqrt{3} \\). This field includes all elements of the form \\( a + b\\sqrt{2} + c\\sqrt{3} + d\\sqrt{6} \\), where \\( a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\). Wait, is that right? Let me check.\n\nLet's consider \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\). This is the same as \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{3}) \\), meaning we first adjoin \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) to get \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\), and then adjoin \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) to that.\n\nI recall that \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\) is a quadratic extension of \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), with basis \\( \\{1, \\sqrt{2}\\} \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\). Then, \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{3}) \\) is an extension of \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\), and I need to find a basis for this extension.\n\nFirst, what's the minimal polynomial of \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\)? Well, \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) is a root of \\( x^2 - 3 \\), which is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\). But is it irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\)? Maybe I should check if \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) is in \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\).\n\nSuppose \\( \\sqrt{3} = a + b\\sqrt{2} \\) for some \\( a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\). Squaring both sides, \\( 3 = a^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{2} + 2b^2 \\). For the coefficients to match, \\( 2ab = 0 \\) and \\( a^2 + 2b^2 = 3 \\). Since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are rational and \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) is irrational, \\( ab = 0 \\). If \\( a = 0 \\), then \\( 2b^2 = 3 \\), so \\( b = \\sqrt{3/2} \\), which is not rational. If \\( b = 0 \\), then \\( a^2 = 3 \\), so \\( a = \\sqrt{3} \\), which again is not rational. Therefore, \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) is not in \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\), so \\( x^2 - 3 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\), and \\( [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) : \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] = 2 \\).\n\nNow, \\( [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\) because the minimal polynomial of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) is \\( x^2 - 2 \\), which has degree 2.\n\nUsing the tower law, \\( [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) : \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] \\times [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\).\n\nSo, the degree should be 4. But let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about a basis for \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\). Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{3}) \\), and \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\) has basis \\( \\{1, \\sqrt{2}\\} \\), and \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\) has basis \\( \\{1, \\sqrt{3}\\} \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\), then a basis for \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) is \\( \\{1, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{6}\\} \\). Indeed, because any element in \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\) can be written as a linear combination of these four elements with coefficients in \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\).\n\nMoreover, these four elements are linearly independent over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\). To see this, suppose there exist \\( a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\) such that \\( a + b\\sqrt{2} + c\\sqrt{3} + d\\sqrt{6} = 0 \\). Then, squaring both sides, we get \\( a^2 + 2b^2 + 3c^2 + 6d^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{2} + 2ac\\sqrt{3} + 2ad\\sqrt{6} + 2bc\\sqrt{6} + 4bd\\sqrt{3} + 2cd\\sqrt{2} = 0 \\). This seems messy, but since \\( \\sqrt{2} \\), \\( \\sqrt{3} \\), and \\( \\sqrt{6} \\) are all irrational and linearly independent over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), the coefficients must all be zero. Therefore, the basis elements are linearly independent, and the degree is 4.\n\nWait a minute, is there a possibility that the degree is 2? If \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6}) \\), for example, then the degree would be 2, but that's not the case. \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\) contains both \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) and \\( \\sqrt{3} \\), whereas \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6}) \\) only contains \\( \\sqrt{6} \\), which is \\( \\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{3} \\), but not \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) or \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) individually unless 6 has certain properties, which it doesn't here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a relation that makes the degree smaller, but I don't think so. I'm pretty confident that the degree is 4.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the minimal polynomial of \\( \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\). If I can find the minimal polynomial of \\( \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\), then the degree of that polynomial would be the degree of the extension.\n\nLet \\( \\alpha = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\). Then, \\( \\alpha^2 = 2 + 3 + 2\\sqrt{6} = 5 + 2\\sqrt{6} \\). So, \\( \\alpha^2 - 5 = 2\\sqrt{6} \\), and \\( (\\alpha^2 - 5)^2 = 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\). Expanding, \\( \\alpha^4 - 10\\alpha^2 + 25 = 24 \\), so \\( \\alpha^4 - 10\\alpha^2 + 1 = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( \\alpha \\) is a root of \\( x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 \\).\n\nIs this polynomial irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\)? Let's check if it factors into quadratics. Suppose it factors as \\( (x^2 + a x + b)(x^2 + c x + d) = x^4 + (a + c)x^3 + (b + d + a c)x^2 + (a d + b c)x + b d \\). Setting coefficients equal:\n\n1. \\( a + c = 0 \\) (since there's no \\( x^3 \\) term)\n\n2. \\( b + d + a c = -10 \\)\n\n3. \\( a d + b c = 0 \\)\n\n4. \\( b d = 1 \\)\n\nFrom the first equation, \\( c = -a \\). From the fourth equation, possible pairs for \\( (b, d) \\) are \\( (1,1), (-1,-1), (1/1, 1/1), (-1/-1, -1/-1) \\), etc., but since coefficients are rational, \\( b \\) and \\( d \\) are integers.\n\nLet's try \\( b = 1 \\), \\( d = 1 \\):\n\nThen, \\( b + d + a c = 1 + 1 + a(-a) = 2 - a^2 = -10 \\), so \\( a^2 = 12 \\), which would make \\( a = \\sqrt{12} \\), not rational. Not good.\n\nTry \\( b = -1 \\), \\( d = -1 \\):\n\nThen, \\( b + d + a c = -1 -1 + a(-a) = -2 - a^2 = -10 \\), so \\( a^2 = 8 \\), again not rational.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\( b = 2 \\), \\( d = \\frac{1}{2} \\), but then \\( d \\) is not an integer. Let's stick with integer coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it doesn't factor over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), meaning it's irreducible, and thus \\( [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 4 \\). But \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) \\) is contained in \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\), and since \\( \\alpha = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\), we can express \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) and \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) in terms of \\( \\alpha \\), so \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) \\), hence the degree is 4.\n\nWait, is that true? Let me see. If \\( \\alpha = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\), can I express \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) and \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) in terms of \\( \\alpha \\)? Let's try.\n\nSuppose \\( \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} = \\alpha \\). Then, \\( \\sqrt{2} = \\alpha - \\sqrt{3} \\). Squaring both sides, \\( 2 = \\alpha^2 - 2\\alpha\\sqrt{3} + 3 \\), so \\( -1 = \\alpha^2 + 2\\alpha\\sqrt{3} \\). Then, \\( \\sqrt{3} = \\frac{-1 - \\alpha^2}{2\\alpha} \\), which is in \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) \\), and similarly, \\( \\sqrt{2} = \\alpha - \\sqrt{3} \\), which is also in \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) \\). Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) \\), and since \\( [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 4 \\), the degree of the extension is 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way to see this. If I consider the basis \\( \\{1, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{6}\\} \\), and note that these are linearly independent over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), then the dimension is 4, confirming the degree is 4.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer should be B. 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
