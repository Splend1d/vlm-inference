                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"If a star that is 20 light-years from Earth explodes, gravitational waves from the explosion would reach Earth in A. less than 20 years. B. 20 years. C. more than 20 years. D. None of these.\"\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First off, I know that a light-year is the distance that light travels in one year. So, if something is 20 light-years away, it means that light from there takes 20 years to reach us. Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime caused by some cosmic events, like exploding stars or merging black holes.\n\nNow, the speed of light is about 299,792 kilometers per second, and that's the fastest anything can travel, right? According to Einstein's theory of relativity, nothing can travel faster than the speed of light.\n\nGravitational waves also travel at the speed of light. I think I remember that from some documentaries or science shows I've watched. So, if gravitational waves travel at the speed of light, and the star is 20 light-years away, it should take 20 years for those waves to reach Earth.\n\nWait a minute, but is there anything that could make it take more or less time? Like, does the energy of the gravitational waves decrease over distance, or is there any medium they have to pass through that might slow them down?\n\nHmm, gravitational waves are supposed to travel through empty space at the speed of light. They aren't affected by matter in the same way electromagnetic waves are, like how light can be blocked by objects. So, I don't think they would be slowed down by passing through stars or planets or anything like that.\n\nAlso, considering that gravitational waves were recently detected from events like black hole mergers and neutron star collisions, and those events are sometimes millions of light-years away, it seems consistent that they travel at the speed of light.\n\nSo, if the star is exactly 20 light-years away, and gravitational waves travel at the speed of light, it should take exactly 20 years for the waves to reach Earth from the explosion.\n\nBut let me think about this again. Is there any possibility that gravitational waves could travel faster or slower than the speed of light under certain conditions?\n\nI recall that in some theoretical models, there might be deviations from Einstein's general relativity, but according to the current understanding, gravitational waves do travel at the speed of light.\n\nMoreover, the recent detections of gravitational waves and their corresponding electromagnetic signals from events like neutron star mergers have shown that gravitational waves and light waves arrive at Earth around the same time, within the measurement uncertainties, which supports the idea that they travel at the same speed.\n\nTherefore, based on our current knowledge, gravitational waves from a star that is 20 light-years away should take 20 years to reach Earth.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, I should consider if there's any distance correction needed. Like, if the star is moving relative to Earth, could that affect the travel time?\n\nWell, the distance given is 20 light-years, which is a measure of the separation in light-travel time. Unless there's significant relative motion or curvature of spacetime, which isn't indicated here, the travel time should be around 20 years.\n\nAlso, considering that gravitational waves propagate through spacetime itself, and in a mostly empty universe, there's nothing to slow them down.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. 20 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
