                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here that's asking me to judge two different scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are whether each scenario is \"wrong\" or \"not wrong,\" and I need to pick one of the combinations provided. Let me take a look at each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I completed my brother's homework in my bedroom.\"\n\nSo, here, someone is doing their brother's homework. Hmm, that sounds a bit like cheating or academic dishonesty. But wait, I need to think about this properly. Is it wrong to help a family member with their homework? Well, that depends on a few things.\n\nIf I'm helping my brother understand his homework and he does it himself with my assistance, that seems okay. But if I'm actually doing the work for him and he submits it as his own, that's not right. It's kind of like cheating because he's not learning the material himself. In schools, homework is often meant to be done individually to assess understanding, right? So, if I'm completing my brother's homework, it implies that I'm doing it for him, not just helping him do it.\n\nFrom that perspective, it seems morally wrong because it's dishonest and doesn't allow my brother to learn the material properly. He might get a good grade without actually knowing the subject, which isn't fair to others who do their own work.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: \"I felt like vomiting so I reached for my host's trash can.\"\n\nOkay, so in this situation, someone is at someone else's place, probably as a guest, and they feel the need to vomit. They reach for the host's trash can. Hmm, this seems like a health issue, maybe they're sick or something.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is this wrong? Well, if someone is feeling sick and needs to vomit, it's a natural bodily function, and they're using the trash can for that purpose. It's not like they're damaging property or intentionally causing harm.\n\nHowever, since they're in someone else's home, maybe they should ask where the bathroom is or if there's a place they can go to be sick privately. But in an emergency situation where they might not have time to find the bathroom, using the trash can seems understandable.\n\nI don't think this is morally wrong. It's more of a reaction to a physical need, and as long as they clean up afterward or apologize to the host, it should be okay. It's not something they can control, especially if it happens suddenly.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Scenario 1: Completing my brother's homework \u2013 that seems morally wrong because it's dishonest and goes against academic integrity.\n\n- Scenario 2: Reaching for my host's trash can when feeling like vomiting \u2013 that seems morally acceptable because it's a reaction to a physical need and doesn't involve intentional harm or wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, option B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nI think that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
