                    "text": "So I have this question here about the attempt by core countries to stimulate increased agricultural production in the periphery through the use of technology, hybrid seeds, and fertilizers. It's asking what this is called, and the options are the First Agricultural Revolution, the Second Agricultural Revolution, the Third Agricultural Revolution, or the Green Revolution.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a \"core country\" and a \"periphery\" refer to in this context. From my understanding in geography and economics, the core countries are typically the more developed nations that have significant economic and political influence, while the periphery refers to the less developed countries that are often economically dependent on the core countries.\n\nSo, the idea here is that these developed countries are trying to help increase agricultural production in less developed countries by introducing things like new technology, hybrid seeds, and fertilizers.\n\nNow, I need to match this description with the correct agricultural revolution.\n\nLet me recall what each of these revolutions entails.\n\nStarting with the First Agricultural Revolution: I believe this refers to the Neolithic Revolution, which was when humans transitioned from hunting and gathering to agriculture and settled farming. This was thousands of years ago and involved the domestication of plants and animals. So, that doesn't seem to fit this context of core countries and modern technological interventions.\n\nNext, the Second Agricultural Revolution: I think this occurred during the Industrial Revolution, in the 18th and 19th centuries. It involved mechanization of agriculture, things like the invention of the seed drill and the reaper, which increased efficiency and production. While this does involve technology and increased production, it's still not the exact fit for the description provided in the question.\n\nThen there's the Third Agricultural Revolution: I'm not as familiar with this term. It might refer to more recent developments in agriculture, perhaps the use of genetics and biotechnology in farming, like GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms). However, the description in the question seems more focused on the introduction of hybrid seeds and fertilizers, which were prominent in another agricultural movement.\n\nFinally, the Green Revolution: I have heard of this before. I think it was a campaign that started in the mid-20th century, around the 1940s to the 1970s, primarily in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. It involved the introduction of high-yield varieties of crops, especially wheat and rice, along with the use of chemical fertilizers and improved irrigation techniques. The goal was to increase food production in developing countries to combat hunger and poverty.\n\nThis seems to align closely with the description in the question: core countries (developed nations) trying to stimulate increased agricultural production in the periphery (developing nations) through technology, hybrid seeds, and fertilizers.\n\nTo make sure I'm not missing something, let's consider the definitions again.\n\nThe First Agricultural Revolution was the neolithic transition to farming.\n\nThe Second Agricultural Revolution was the mechanization of agriculture during the Industrial Revolution.\n\nThe Third Agricultural Revolution could be interpreted as the modern use of biotechnology and genetics in agriculture.\n\nThe Green Revolution was the specific period in the mid-20th century when high-yield crops and agricultural technologies were promoted in developing countries.\n\nGiven this, the Green Revolution seems to be the most precise answer to the question, as it directly refers to the effort to increase agricultural production in less developed regions through the introduction of new technologies and seed varieties.\n\nMoreover, the term \"Green Revolution\" is commonly used in geographical and historical contexts to describe this particular period and set of initiatives.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Green Revolution.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider if there's any other way the question could be interpreted. Perhaps someone might argue that the use of hybrid seeds and fertilizers could be part of a larger agricultural revolution, but in the context of the options provided, the Green Revolution is the most fitting description.\n\nIn conclusion, the attempt by core countries to stimulate increased agricultural production in the periphery through the use of technology, hybrid seeds, and fertilizers is called the Green Revolution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Green Revolution}} \\]"
