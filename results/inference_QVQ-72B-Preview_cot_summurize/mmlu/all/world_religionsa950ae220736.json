I'm not an expert on Hinduism, but I do know a bit about it.\n\nFirst off, I know that bhakti is a term from Hinduism, right? It's related to their spiritual practices. Let me think about what I've read or heard about bhakti. I think it's a type of yoga, but not the physical exercise kind that we're used to in the West. In Hinduism, yoga refers to various spiritual disciplines.\n\nOption B is Yoga. Wait, but that seems too broad. Bhakti is a specific type of yoga, isn't it? So maybe it's not just translated as yoga in general.\n\nOption C is Devotion. That sounds familiar. I think bhakti is often associated with devotion to a particular deity or to the divine in general. So, devotion seems like a good translation.\n\nOption A is Gods. Well, bhakti is about devotion to a god, but it's more about the act of devotion rather than the deities themselves. So, maybe not gods.\n\nOption D is Religion. That seems too encompassing. Religion is a broader term that includes many aspects, whereas bhakti is a specific path within Hinduism focused on devotion.\n\nLet me consider this again. If bhakti is a path of devotion to a divine being, then devotion seems like the most direct translation. It's about loving and being devoted to a god, isn't it?\n\nI recall a phrase, \"bhakti yoga,\" which is often referred to as the path of devotion. So, again, that points towards devotion being the correct translation.\n\nMaybe I should look up the definition to be sure. Okay, according to some sources, bhakti is indeed often translated as devotion. It emphasizes love and devotion to a personal god or gods.\n\nSo, based on that, option C. Devotion seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider the other options again. Option A. Gods \u2013 while bhakti involves devotion to gods, the term itself isn't translating to gods but to the act of devotion. Similarly, option D. Religion \u2013 bhakti is part of a religion, but it's not the entire religion itself.\n\nOption B. Yoga \u2013 well, bhakti is one of the paths of yoga in Hinduism, but it's not the same as yoga in general. Yoga can refer to various spiritual practices, including karma yoga (the path of action), jnana yoga (the path of knowledge), and raja yoga (the path of meditation). So, bhakti is a specific type of yoga, but not yoga as a whole.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate translation of bhakti is devotion. That makes sense.\n\nI think I've got it right. Bhakti is often translated as devotion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Devotion}} \\]"
