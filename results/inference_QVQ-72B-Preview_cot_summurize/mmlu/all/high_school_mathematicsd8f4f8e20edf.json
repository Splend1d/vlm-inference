                    "text": "I have this problem here that defines a \"powerful\" number as one where, for every prime factor p of n, p\u00b2 is also a factor of n. So, basically, if a number has a prime factor p, then p squared should also divide n. I need to find which of these options\u2014392, 336, 300, or 297\u2014is a powerful number.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a powerful number is. It seems like it's related to the exponents of its prime factors. Specifically, for each prime factor p, the exponent in the prime factorization of n for p must be at least 2. So, if p is a prime factor of n, then p\u00b2 should also divide n.\n\nAlright, so to check if a number is powerful, I should factorize it into its prime factors and then check if for every prime factor p, the exponent of p in the factorization is at least 2.\n\nLet me try this with each option.\n\nStarting with 392.\n\nI need to factorize 392 into its prime factors.\n\n392 divided by 2 is 196.\n\n196 divided by 2 is 98.\n\n98 divided by 2 is 49.\n\n49 is 7 squared, 7 times 7.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 392 is 2^3 \u00d7 7^2.\n\nNow, the prime factors are 2 and 7.\n\nFor 2, the exponent is 3, which is greater than 2.\n\nFor 7, the exponent is 2, which is equal to 2.\n\nSo, both prime factors satisfy the condition that their exponents are at least 2.\n\nTherefore, 392 is a powerful number.\n\nBut the question says \"an example of a powerful number is\", and it's multiple choice with options A through D.\n\nWait, maybe I need to identify which one is powerful among these options.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to check all of them and see which one fits the definition.\n\nLet's check 336 next.\n\nFactorizing 336.\n\n336 divided by 2 is 168.\n\n168 divided by 2 is 84.\n\n84 divided by 2 is 42.\n\n42 divided by 2 is 21.\n\n21 is 3 times 7.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 336 is 2^4 \u00d7 3^1 \u00d7 7^1.\n\nNow, the prime factors are 2, 3, and 7.\n\nFor 2, exponent is 4, which is greater than 2.\n\nFor 3, exponent is 1, which is less than 2.\n\nFor 7, exponent is 1, which is less than 2.\n\nSo, according to the definition, for a number to be powerful, for every prime factor p, p\u00b2 should divide n, meaning the exponent of p in the prime factorization should be at least 2.\n\nIn 336, the exponents for 3 and 7 are both 1, which is less than 2.\n\nTherefore, 336 is not a powerful number.\n\nNext, 300.\n\nFactorizing 300.\n\n300 divided by 2 is 150.\n\n150 divided by 2 is 75.\n\n75 divided by 3 is 25.\n\n25 is 5 squared, 5 times 5.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 300 is 2^2 \u00d7 3^1 \u00d7 5^2.\n\nPrime factors are 2, 3, and 5.\n\nFor 2, exponent is 2.\n\nFor 3, exponent is 1.\n\nFor 5, exponent is 2.\n\nBut according to the definition, for 3, the exponent should be at least 2, but it's only 1.\n\nTherefore, 300 is not a powerful number.\n\nLastly, 297.\n\nFactorizing 297.\n\n297 divided by 3 is 99.\n\n99 divided by 3 is 33.\n\n33 divided by 3 is 11.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 297 is 3^3 \u00d7 11^1.\n\nPrime factors are 3 and 11.\n\nFor 3, exponent is 3, which is greater than 2.\n\nFor 11, exponent is 1, which is less than 2.\n\nTherefore, 297 is not a powerful number.\n\nSo, out of the given options, only 392 satisfies the condition for being a powerful number because both its prime factors, 2 and 7, have exponents of at least 2 in the prime factorization.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check the definition to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nThe problem says: \"a positive integer n is called 'powerful' if, for every prime factor p of n, p\u00b2 is also a factor of n.\"\n\nSo, in other words, if p is a prime factor of n, then p\u00b2 must divide n.\n\nIn terms of exponents in the prime factorization, this means that for each prime p, the exponent a_p must be at least 2.\n\nBecause if p is a factor, then p\u00b2 must also be a factor, meaning p\u00b2 divides n, which implies that a_p >= 2.\n\nSo, in the prime factorization n = p\u2081^{a\u2081} \u00d7 p\u2082^{a\u2082} \u00d7 ... \u00d7 p_k^{a_k}, for every p_i that appears, a_i must be at least 2.\n\nLooking back at 392, its prime factorization is 2^3 \u00d7 7^2.\n\nBoth exponents are at least 2, so it qualifies.\n\nFor 336, it's 2^4 \u00d7 3^1 \u00d7 7^1.\n\nHere, 3 and 7 have exponent 1, which is less than 2, so it doesn't qualify.\n\nFor 300, it's 2^2 \u00d7 3^1 \u00d7 5^2.\n\nAgain, 3 has exponent 1, which is less than 2.\n\nFor 297, it's 3^3 \u00d7 11^1.\n\n11 has exponent 1, which is less than 2.\n\nTherefore, among the given options, only 392 is a powerful number.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"an example of a powerful number is\", and it's multiple choice with options A through D.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is A. 392.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are multiple powerful numbers among the options.\n\nFrom my calculations, only 392 qualifies.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 392.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me check if there's any other way to interpret the definition.\n\nAnother way to think about powerful numbers is that they are square-free only if they are squares themselves, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, actually, square-free numbers have no repeated prime factors, whereas powerful numbers require that if a prime divides n, its square also divides n.\n\nSo, they are different concepts.\n\nIn any case, based on the definition provided, 392 is the only one that fits the criteria among the given options.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 392.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 392} \\]"
