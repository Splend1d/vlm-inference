                    "text": "Let's see here. So, we've got this scenario where there's an expansionary fiscal policy, and as a result, real output increases by a lot, but the price level only goes up a little. And we need to figure out what that implies from the given options. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, expansionary fiscal policy typically involves increasing government spending or cutting taxes, right? That's meant to stimulate the economy, usually when it's underperforming. So, if that policy leads to a big increase in real output but only a small rise in prices, what does that suggest about the economy's initial condition and the way its supply and demand curves are behaving?\n\nLet's recall some basic macroeconomics here. The relationship between aggregate demand and aggregate supply determines the price level and real output in the economy. The aggregate demand curve is downward-sloping, meaning that higher price levels lead to lower quantities demanded, and vice versa. The aggregate supply curve can have different shapes depending on the level of output and capacity utilization.\n\nOption A says that inflation had already impacted the economy before the fiscal stimulus. Hmm, not sure about that. If inflation was already present, maybe there would be more pressure on prices with increased demand. But in this case, the price level only increased a little, despite a large increase in real output. So, perhaps inflation wasn't a big factor here initially. Maybe.\n\nOption B suggests that the economy initially had some unemployed resources. That makes sense. If there are unused resources, like unemployed people or underutilized factories, then increasing demand through fiscal policy can bring those resources back into use without causing a big spike in prices. So, more output is produced without much pressure on prices. That seems plausible.\n\nOption C says that aggregate supply decreased. Wait, that would mean it shifted leftward. If aggregate supply decreases, that would typically lead to higher prices and lower output, which contradicts our scenario where output increased significantly and prices only rose a little. So, that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nOption D mentions that aggregate demand is steeply sloped. The slope of the aggregate demand curve affects how changes in the price level influence real output. A steeper aggregate demand curve suggests that changes in the price level lead to smaller changes in real output. But in our scenario, we see a large increase in real output with a small increase in prices, which seems more consistent with a relatively flat aggregate demand curve, not a steep one. So, that doesn't seem to align.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps I should consider the position of the aggregate supply curve. In the short run, the aggregate supply curve is upward-sloping, meaning that as output increases, prices also rise, but only up to a point. Beyond that, if the economy reaches full employment or its potential output, further increases in demand can lead to higher prices without much increase in output.\n\nGiven that in this scenario, output increases a lot with only a small increase in prices, it suggests that the aggregate supply curve is relatively flat in the relevant range. That is, increases in output lead to only small increases in prices. This would make sense if the economy had spare capacity, meaning there are unemployed resources that can be put to work without causing much inflationary pressure.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Suppose the economy is operating below its potential output. Then, an increase in aggregate demand due to expansionary fiscal policy would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. Given that the aggregate supply curve is relatively flat in this range, the result would be a larger increase in output and a smaller increase in prices, which matches our scenario.\n\nAs the economy approaches its potential output, the aggregate supply curve becomes steeper, meaning that small increases in output lead to larger increases in prices. But in this case, since the price level only increased a little despite a large increase in output, it suggests that the economy was not close to its potential output initially. Hence, there was slack in the economy, meaning unemployed resources.\n\nThis reasoning seems to support option B: the economy initially had some unemployed resources. Let me check again to make sure.\n\nIf option B is correct, and there were unemployed resources, then yes, expansionary fiscal policy would primarily lead to increased output with minimal price increases, as those resources are utilized without overburdening the economy's production capacity.\n\nOption A, about inflation already impacting the economy before the fiscal stimulus, doesn't directly follow from the scenario. If anything, the small increase in prices suggests that inflationary pressures were low, possibly because of the unused resources.\n\nOption C, suggesting a decrease in aggregate supply, doesn't align with the observed increase in output and only a small increase in prices. A decrease in aggregate supply would typically lead to higher prices and lower output, which isn't what happened here.\n\nOption D, stating that aggregate demand is steeply sloped, contradicts the observed large increase in output with a small increase in prices. A steep aggregate demand curve would imply that a given change in the price level leads to a smaller change in output, which doesn't match our scenario.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate inference from the given scenario is option B: the economy initially had some unemployed resources.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
