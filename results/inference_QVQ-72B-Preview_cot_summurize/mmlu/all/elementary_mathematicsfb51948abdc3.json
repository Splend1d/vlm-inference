                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem that says, \"Which algebraic expression represents four times the quantity 22 less than x?\" And there are four options to choose from: A. 4(x \u2013 22), B. (4 \u2022 22) \u2013 x, C. 4(22 \u2013 x), D. (x \u2022 4) \u2013 22.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It wants \"four times the quantity 22 less than x.\" So, I need to break this down.\n\nLet's start with \"the quantity 22 less than x.\" I think \"less than\" means subtraction, right? So, if x is some number and I subtract 22 from it, that should be x minus 22.\n\nNow, it says \"four times\" that quantity. So, I need to multiply that result by 4. So, it should be 4 times (x - 22).\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 4(x \u2013 22), which matches what I just thought. Option B is (4 \u2022 22) \u2013 x, which is different. Option C is 4(22 \u2013 x), and option D is (x \u2022 4) \u2013 22.\n\nSo, between these, option A seems correct, but let me double-check.\n\nWait a minute, option C is 4(22 \u2013 x). Is that the same as 4(x \u2013 22)? No, because 22 \u2013 x is not the same as x \u2013 22. One is negative of the other unless x equals 22.\n\nSo, 4(x \u2013 22) is not the same as 4(22 \u2013 x). Therefore, option C is different.\n\nOption B is (4 \u2022 22) \u2013 x, which is 88 \u2013 x. That doesn't match what the problem is asking for, because it's subtracting x from 88, not multiplying the difference by 4.\n\nOption D is (x \u2022 4) \u2013 22, which is 4x \u2013 22. That's different from 4(x \u2013 22), because 4(x \u2013 22) is 4x \u2013 88.\n\nWait, let's expand option A to make sure. 4(x \u2013 22) = 4*x \u2013 4*22 = 4x \u2013 88. So, that makes sense.\n\nOption D is 4x \u2013 22, which is different from 4x \u2013 88. So, it's not the same.\n\nOption B is 88 \u2013 x, which is also different.\n\nOption C is 4(22 \u2013 x) = 4*22 \u2013 4*x = 88 \u2013 4x, which is different from 4x \u2013 88.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems to be the correct one.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's pick a number for x and see which expression matches the description.\n\nLet's say x = 25.\n\nThen, \"22 less than x\" would be 25 \u2013 22 = 3.\n\nThen, four times that quantity is 4 * 3 = 12.\n\nSo, the correct expression should give us 12 when x = 25.\n\nLet's plug x = 25 into each option:\n\nOption A: 4(x \u2013 22) = 4(25 \u2013 22) = 4(3) = 12. That matches.\n\nOption B: (4 \u2022 22) \u2013 x = 88 \u2013 25 = 63. That's not 12.\n\nOption C: 4(22 \u2013 x) = 4(22 \u2013 25) = 4(-3) = -12. Not 12.\n\nOption D: (x \u2022 4) \u2013 22 = (25 * 4) \u2013 22 = 100 \u2013 22 = 78. Not 12.\n\nSo, only option A gives the correct result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 4(x \u2013 22).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 4(x - 22)} \\]"
