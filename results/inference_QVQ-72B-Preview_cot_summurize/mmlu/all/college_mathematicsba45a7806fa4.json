                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a linear transformation \\(f\\) from the plane to the real numbers. That means \\(f\\) takes points in the plane, like \\((x, y)\\), and maps them to real numbers. The key points are that \\(f(1, 1) = 1\\) and \\(f(-1, 0) = 2\\), and we need to find \\(f(3, 5)\\).\n\nFirst off, since \\(f\\) is a linear transformation, it must satisfy two properties for any scalars \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and any points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\):\n\n1. \\(f(a(x_1, y_1) + b(x_2, y_2)) = a f(x_1, y_1) + b f(x_2, y_2)\\)\n\n2. \\(f(0, 0) = 0\\)\n\nGiven that, maybe I can express \\((3, 5)\\) as a linear combination of \\((1,1)\\) and \\((-1,0)\\), and then use the linearity to find \\(f(3,5)\\).\n\nLet's try to find scalars \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that:\n\n\\[a(1,1) + b(-1,0) = (3,5)\\]\n\nSo, that gives us two equations:\n\n\\[a - b = 3\\]\\[a + 0b = 5\\]\n\nSo, from the second equation, \\(a = 5\\). Plugging that into the first equation:\n\n\\[5 - b = 3 \\implies b = 2\\]\n\nGreat, so \\((3,5) = 5(1,1) + 2(-1,0)\\). Now, using the linearity of \\(f\\):\n\n\\[f(3,5) = 5f(1,1) + 2f(-1,0) = 5(1) + 2(2) = 5 + 4 = 9\\]\n\nSo, according to this, \\(f(3,5) = 9\\). But wait, let's double-check if this makes sense.\n\nFirst, is \\(f\\) indeed linear? The problem states that \\(f\\) is a linear transformation, so I think it's safe to assume that. Also, I need to make sure that the points \\((1,1)\\) and \\((-1,0)\\) are linearly independent; they are, since there's no scalar that multiplies \\((1,1)\\) to get \\((-1,0)\\). So, they form a basis for the plane, which allows me to express any point as a linear combination of them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the standard form of \\(f\\). Since \\(f\\) is a linear transformation from \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), it can be represented by a dot product with some vector \\((a, b)\\):\n\n\\[f(x, y) = a x + b y\\]\n\nSo, using the given points:\n\n\\[f(1,1) = a(1) + b(1) = 1 \\implies a + b = 1\\]\\[f(-1,0) = a(-1) + b(0) = 2 \\implies -a = 2 \\implies a = -2\\]\n\nPlugging \\(a = -2\\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[-2 + b = 1 \\implies b = 3\\]\n\nSo, \\(f(x, y) = -2x + 3y\\). Now, let's compute \\(f(3,5)\\):\n\n\\[f(3,5) = -2(3) + 3(5) = -6 + 15 = 9\\]\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier result. So, \\(f(3,5) = 9\\).\n\nWait a minute, but the problem is multiple-choice, and option A is 9. But just to be thorough, let's see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the properties of linear transformations to find \\(f(3,5)\\) directly, without finding the explicit form of \\(f\\).\n\nWe already have:\n\n\\[f(3,5) = f(5(1,1) + 2(-1,0)) = 5f(1,1) + 2f(-1,0) = 5(1) + 2(2) = 9\\]\n\nAlternatively, perhaps expressing \\((3,5)\\) in terms of the standard basis \\((1,0)\\) and \\((0,1)\\), but that might not be necessary since we've already found a straightforward way.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider \\(f\\) as a linear functional, its matrix representation would be a row vector \\([a, b]\\), so:\n\n\\[[a, b] \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 1 \\implies a + b = 1\\]\\[[a, b] \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 2 \\implies -a = 2 \\implies a = -2\\]\n\nThen, \\(b = 3\\), as before.\n\nTherefore, \\(f(x, y) = -2x + 3y\\), and \\(f(3,5) = -2(3) + 3(5) = -6 + 15 = 9\\).\n\nI think it's consistent across different methods, so I'm confident that the answer is 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
