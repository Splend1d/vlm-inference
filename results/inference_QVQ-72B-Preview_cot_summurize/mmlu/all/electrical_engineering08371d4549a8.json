                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a long wire that's a smooth, round conductor running parallel to the ground, and there's a high voltage between the conductor and the ground. We need to figure out where the maximum electric stress occurs.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what electric stress is. I think it's related to the electric field strength, right? Like, where the electric field is strongest, that's where the stress is highest. So, essentially, I need to find out where the electric field is strongest in this setup.\n\nOkay, so we have a conductor above a ground plane, and they're parallel. Since the conductor is round and smooth, I can assume that the charge distribution on the conductor is uniform, at least in the regions where there aren't any sharp points or irregularities.\n\nNow, the electric field around a charged conductor is such that it's perpendicular to the surface of the conductor. And the magnitude of the electric field depends on the charge density on the conductor's surface.\n\nI recall that for a charged infinite plane, the electric field is uniform and proportional to the charge density. But here, we have a cylindrical conductor above a ground plane.\n\nWait, but the conductor is long and parallel to the ground, so maybe we can model this as an infinite line charge above an infinite conducting plane.\n\nIn that case, the electric field lines would be radial away from the conductor towards the ground.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about that. Maybe I should think about image charges.\n\nI remember that in electrostatics, when you have a charged object near a conducting plane, you can model the system using image charges. The real charge and its image create the electric field distribution.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the conductor has a positive charge (assuming it's at a high voltage), and the ground is at zero potential.\n\nThe image charge would be a negative charge placed below the ground plane at the same distance as the real charge above it.\n\nSo, if the conductor is at height h above the ground, the image charge would be at -h below the ground.\n\nNow, the electric field is determined by the superposition of the fields from the real charge and the image charge.\n\nSo, the electric field at any point would be the vector sum of the fields from the real charge and the image charge.\n\nNow, I need to find where the electric field is strongest. That is, where the magnitude of the electric field is maximum.\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\nA. Lower surface of the conductor.\n\nB. Upper surface of the conductor.\n\nC. The ground surface.\n\nD. Midway between the conductor and ground.\n\nI need to evaluate the electric field at these locations.\n\nFirst, at the lower surface of the conductor (option A).\n\nHere, the real charge is just above, and the image charge is below. The electric fields from both charges would be adding up in the same direction, probably making the field stronger there.\n\nWait, no. The real charge is positive, and the image charge is negative. At the lower surface of the conductor, the field from the real charge is directed radially outward, and from the image charge is directed radially inward. But since they are on opposite sides, their fields might be adding up or canceling each other depending on their directions.\n\nActually, I need to think more carefully.\n\nThe real charge is above the ground, and the image charge is below the ground.\n\nAt the lower surface of the conductor, the field due to the real charge is directed away from the conductor towards the ground, and the field due to the image charge is directed towards the conductor from the ground.\n\nSo, both fields are directed away from the conductor at the lower surface, meaning they add up, making the field stronger there.\n\nHmm, that makes sense.\n\nNow, at the upper surface of the conductor (option B).\n\nHere, the real charge is on the inside, and the image charge is below.\n\nThe field due to the real charge at the upper surface would be directed radially outward, but since the conductor is a round cylinder, at the upper surface, it's more like directed upwards.\n\nWait, no. Actually, at the upper surface, the field due to the real charge would be directed radially outward from the conductor.\n\nThe image charge is below the ground, so its field at the upper surface would be directed downwards towards the image charge.\n\nSo, the real charge's field is upwards, and the image charge's field is downwards. They are in opposite directions at the upper surface, so their fields would partially cancel each other out, making the field weaker there compared to the lower surface.\n\nTherefore, the electric field is weaker at the upper surface than at the lower surface.\n\nSo, option A seems more likely than option B.\n\nNow, option C: the ground surface.\n\nAt the ground surface, the field due to the real charge is directed towards the ground, and the field due to the image charge is directed away from the ground.\n\nSo, again, they are in opposite directions, leading to cancellation, making the field weaker there as well.\n\nWait, but the ground is a conducting plane, and it's at zero potential. The electric field at the ground surface should be perpendicular to the ground and directed upwards towards the conductor.\n\nBut according to the image charge method, the field due to the image charge at the ground surface would be directed downwards, opposite to the field due to the real charge.\n\nSo, again, there is cancellation at the ground surface, making the field weaker compared to the lower surface of the conductor.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent.\n\nFinally, option D: midway between the conductor and the ground.\n\nAt this point, both the real charge and the image charge are at equal distances but on opposite sides.\n\nThe field due to the real charge is directed away from the conductor towards the ground, and the field due to the image charge is directed away from the image charge towards the conductor.\n\nSo, both fields are directed from the conductor to the ground, meaning they add up at this point.\n\nBut earlier, at the lower surface of the conductor, the fields also add up.\n\nSo, between the lower surface and the midpoint, where is the field stronger?\n\nI need to compare these two positions.\n\nAt the lower surface of the conductor, the distance to the real charge is zero (since it's on the surface), and to the image charge is 2h (if h is the height of the conductor above the ground).\n\nWait, no. If the conductor is at height h above the ground, then the image charge is at depth h below the ground.\n\nSo, at the lower surface of the conductor, the distance to the real charge is zero, and to the image charge is 2h.\n\nAt the midpoint between the conductor and the ground, the distance to both the real charge and the image charge is h.\n\nSo, since electric field decreases with distance, the field due to the image charge is stronger at the midpoint than at the lower surface of the conductor.\n\nBut the field due to the real charge is zero at the midpoint, because it's at a distance h from the real charge, whereas at the lower surface, it's at zero distance from the real charge.\n\nWait, no. At the lower surface, the distance to the real charge is zero, meaning we're right on the surface, so the field due to the real charge is maximum there.\n\nWait, but electric field is proportional to charge per distance squared, right? So, at the lower surface, the field due to the real charge is infinite, because distance is zero.\n\nBut in reality, the conductor has a finite radius, so the surface isn't a mathematical point, but a curved surface.\n\nActually, in practical terms, the electric field at the surface of a conductor is finite and equal to the voltage gradient.\n\nBut in this idealized model, perhaps the field is infinite at the surface.\n\nHowever, maybe that's not the case due to the presence of the image charge.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum electric stress occurs just above the conductor's surface, not exactly on the surface.\n\nBut option A says \"lower surface of the conductor,\" which could be interpreted as the surface itself or just above it.\n\nI need to be careful here.\n\nLet me consider the electric field just outside the lower surface of the conductor, say at a distance epsilon above it.\n\nAt that point, the field due to the real charge is very strong, almost infinite as epsilon approaches zero, directed radially outward.\n\nThe field due to the image charge is directed radially inward, but since it's farther away (at a distance approximately 2h), its field is weaker.\n\nTherefore, the net field is predominantly outward, and its magnitude is very large, approaching infinity as we approach the surface.\n\nAt the midpoint, both the real charge and the image charge are at a distance h, so their fields are equal in magnitude and add up, but since h is larger than epsilon, the field at the midpoint is less than at the lower surface.\n\nSimilarly, at the ground surface, the fields from the real and image charges cancel each other out, making the field weaker there.\n\nTherefore, the maximum electric stress occurs at the lower surface of the conductor.\n\nSo, the answer should be option A.\n\nBut wait, I recall that in practice, the highest electric field stresses occur at points or protrusions on conductors due to increased charge densities there.\n\nBut in this problem, the conductor is smooth and round, so there are no sharp points to concentrate the charge.\n\nTherefore, the charge distribution should be uniform along the conductor's surface, and the electric field should be maximum at the lower surface.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of electric potential, the potential difference is between the conductor and the ground.\n\nThe electric field lines would run from the conductor to the ground, and their density (and thus the field strength) would be greatest where the separation is smallest, which is at the lower surface.\n\nSo, all this reinforces that the maximum electric stress is at the lower surface of the conductor.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
