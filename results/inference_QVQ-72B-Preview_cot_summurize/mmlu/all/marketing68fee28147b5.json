Stratified and convenience samples.\n\nD. Random and cluster samples.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a non-random sample is. From what I remember in statistics, a non-random sample is one where not every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. Unlike random sampling, where each member has a known and equal probability of being chosen, non-random sampling involves selecting participants based on other criteria.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Convenience and quota samples.\n\nConvenience sampling is when you pick participants who are easy to reach or convenient to access. For example, interviewing people who happen to be walking by a certain location. This is definitely not random because you're not giving everyone an equal chance to be selected.\n\nQuota sampling involves setting quotas for certain characteristics and then selecting participants who meet those quotas. It's still not random because you're specifically targeting certain groups based on predefined criteria.\n\nB. Cluster and convenience samples.\n\nCluster sampling is a bit different. In cluster sampling, you divide the population into clusters, maybe based on location or some other factor, and then randomly select some of these clusters. Within the selected clusters, you might sample all units or randomly select units. So, there is an element of randomness here, especially in selecting the clusters.\n\nConvenience sampling, as I mentioned earlier, is non-random.\n\nSo, this option combines a sampling method that has some randomness (cluster sampling) with one that is non-random (convenience sampling).\n\nC. Stratified and convenience samples.\n\nStratified sampling involves dividing the population into strata or layers based on certain characteristics and then taking a random sample from each stratum. This is actually a type of probability sampling, which means it is based on random selection within each stratum.\n\nConvenience sampling, again, is non-random.\n\nSo, this option pairs a probability sampling method (stratified sampling) with a non-random method (convenience sampling).\n\nD. Random and cluster samples.\n\nRandom sampling, as the name suggests, is when every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. This is the most straightforward probability sampling method.\n\nCluster sampling, as I mentioned before, involves selecting clusters randomly and then sampling within those clusters. So, cluster sampling does involve randomness in the selection of clusters.\n\nTherefore, both random and cluster samples are forms of probability sampling, which means they involve random selection processes.\n\nGiven all this, the correct answer should be A. Convenience and quota samples, because both of these are non-random sampling methods.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's recap:\n\n- Convenience sampling: non-random because it's based on ease of access.\n\n- Quota sampling: non-random because it sets quotas for specific characteristics and doesn't involve random selection.\n\n- Cluster sampling: involves randomness in selecting clusters, even if within clusters the selection might not be random, but often it is.\n\n- Stratified sampling: involves randomness within each stratum.\n\n- Random sampling: entirely random selection.\n\nSo, options B, C, and D all include at least one sampling method that involves randomness, whereas option A consists solely of non-random sampling methods.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Convenience and quota samples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
