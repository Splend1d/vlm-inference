                    "text": "So here's this problem about an elevator that's fallen 100 meters, and I need to find out how much heat the brakes have to dissipate to bring it to a stop. Let's see... The elevator is 1000 kg, and it starts from rest, then falls 100 meters before the brakes stop it. I need to find the heat dissipated by the brakes.\n\nFirst, I should think about the energy involved here. When the cable snaps, the elevator is at rest, and then it falls under the force of gravity. So, as it falls, its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The brakes have to stop it, which means they have to convert that kinetic energy into heat.\n\nSo, the heat dissipated by the brakes should be equal to the kinetic energy that the elevator has just before the brakes stop it. But what's that kinetic energy?\n\nWell, since it started from rest and fell 100 meters under gravity, I can use the conservation of energy principle. The potential energy at the top is mgh, where m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is height. So, potential energy is 1000 kg times 9.8 m/s\u00b2 times 100 m.\n\nLet me calculate that: 1000 * 9.8 * 100.\n\nFirst, 1000 * 9.8 is 9800, then 9800 * 100 is 980,000 joules.\n\nSo, the potential energy is 980,000 joules, which should be equal to the kinetic energy just before it's stopped by the brakes.\n\nWait, but the answer options are in joules, and 980,000 isn't listed. The closest is 1,000,000 J, but that seems too high. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me double-check. Is there any other energy involved? Like, is there friction or anything else that might affect this?\n\nThe problem says the cable snaps, and the elevator falls freely until the brakes stop it. It doesn't mention any friction or anything like that during the fall, so I think we can assume it's a frictionless fall until the brakes engage.\n\nWhen the brakes stop it, they have to dissipate the entire kinetic energy that the elevator has due to its fall.\n\nSo, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv\u00b2, but since it started from rest and fell a distance h under gravity, v\u00b2 = 2gh, so kinetic energy is (1/2)mv\u00b2 = mgh, which is what I had before, 980,000 J.\n\nBut that's not one of the options. Maybe I need to consider that the brakes don't stop it instantly; maybe there's some work done during the braking process.\n\nWait, the problem says the brakes stop the elevator shortly before it reaches the bottom of the shaft. So, perhaps the brakes are applied over a certain distance, not instantly.\n\nIf that's the case, then the brakes have to do work to stop the elevator over that distance, and that work is converted into heat.\n\nSo, total energy that needs to be dissipated as heat is the kinetic energy the elevator has plus any potential energy it has at the point where the brakes start to stop it.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I'm overthinking it.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider the entire energy before the fall and after the brakes stop it.\n\nInitially, the elevator is at rest at the top, so it has potential energy mgh, which is 980,000 J, and no kinetic energy.\n\nWhen it's stopped by the brakes, it's at rest again, so it has no kinetic energy and no potential energy relative to the bottom.\n\nSo, the total energy change is the loss of potential energy, which is 980,000 J, and that should all be dissipated as heat by the brakes.\n\nBut again, that's not an option. The highest option is 1,000,000 J, which is less than that.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider significant figures or rounding. The mass is given as 1000 kg, but maybe g is 9.81 m/s\u00b2.\n\nLet me recalculate with g = 9.81 m/s\u00b2.\n\nSo, mgh = 1000 kg * 9.81 m/s\u00b2 * 100 m = 981,000 J.\n\nStill not 1,000,000 J. Maybe it's just rounded to the nearest hundred thousand, but 980,000 is closer to 1,000,000 than to 900,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something in the problem.\n\nLet me read it again: \"the suspension cable of a 1,000 kg elevator snaps, sending the elevator moving downward through its shaft. The emergency brakes of the elevator stop the elevator shortly before it reaches the bottom of the shaft. If the elevator fell a distance of 100 m starting from rest, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is.\"\n\nOkay, so it fell 100 m, starting from rest, and the brakes stop it before it hits the bottom.\n\nI think the key is that the brakes have to stop the elevator after it has fallen 100 m, meaning they have to dissipate the kinetic energy it gained during that fall.\n\nSo, as I calculated, that should be mgh = 1000 * 9.8 * 100 = 980,000 J.\n\nUnless there's something else going on, like the brakes are applied during the fall, but the problem says \"stop the elevator shortly before it reaches the bottom,\" which suggests that the brakes are applied at the end of the fall, not during.\n\nSo, the elevator falls 100 m, gaining kinetic energy, and then the brakes stop it, converting that kinetic energy into heat.\n\nTherefore, the heat dissipated should be equal to the kinetic energy, which is equal to the potential energy it had at the start, which is 980,000 J.\n\nBut that's not an option. The closest is 1,000,000 J, which is 10^6 J.\n\nMaybe they're approximating g as 10 m/s\u00b2 for simplicity, so mgh = 1000 * 10 * 100 = 1,000,000 J.\n\nThat would make 1,000,000 J the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that all the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy and then to heat.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the work done by the brakes.\n\nThe brakes have to do work against the kinetic energy to stop the elevator, and that work is converted into heat.\n\nSo, work done by brakes = kinetic energy of the elevator = mgh.\n\nTherefore, heat dissipated = work done by brakes = mgh = 1000 * 9.8 * 100 = 980,000 J, which rounds to 1,000,000 J.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is D. 1,000,000 J.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the work done against gravity as well.\n\nWait, no. The elevator is falling freely under gravity until the brakes are applied.\n\nOnce the brakes are applied, they have to stop the elevator by doing work against its kinetic energy.\n\nSo, the heat dissipated should indeed be equal to the kinetic energy right before the brakes are applied, which is equal to the potential energy at the start, mgh.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 980,000 J, which rounds to 1,000,000 J.\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. 1,000,000 J.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
