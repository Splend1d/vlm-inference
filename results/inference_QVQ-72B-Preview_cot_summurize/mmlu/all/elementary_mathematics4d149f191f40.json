                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about Bella's photos. It says she has all her photos in 8 photo books, and each photo book has 25 photos. I need to find out the total number of photos she has. And there are four options given: A. 25 \u00f7 8, B. 25 \u2013 8, C. 25 + 8, and D. 25 \u00d7 8.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what's being asked. Bella has 8 photo books, and each book contains 25 photos. So, if each book has 25 photos, and there are 8 of them, I need to find the total number of photos. Hmm, that sounds like a multiplication problem.\n\nLet me think about it step by step. If I have one photo book, it has 25 photos. If I have two photo books, they have 25 times 2, which is 50 photos. So, for eight photo books, it should be 25 times 8. Wait, that's option D. 25 \u00d7 8.\n\nBut let me make sure. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Could I add 25 eight times? Like 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25. That would also give me the total number of photos. Yeah, that's the same as multiplying 25 by 8.\n\nWhat about the other options? Option A is 25 \u00f7 8. That would be dividing 25 by 8, which would give me 3.125. That doesn't make sense in this context because you can't have a fraction of a photo. So, that can't be right.\n\nOption B is 25 \u2013 8. That would be subtracting 8 from 25, which is 17. Again, that doesn't seem logical for finding the total number of photos from 8 books, each with 25 photos.\n\nOption C is 25 + 8. That's adding 8 to 25, which is 33. While addition can sometimes be used in similar problems, in this case, it doesn't represent the total number of photos correctly. Adding 8 to 25 doesn't account for the fact that there are 8 separate photo books, each with their own set of photos.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, D. 25 \u00d7 8 seems to be the correct expression to find the total number of photos Bella has.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check with a smaller number to be sure. Suppose Bella had only 2 photo books, each with 25 photos. Then, the total would be 25 \u00d7 2 = 50 photos. Yeah, that makes sense. Similarly, with 8 photo books, it should be 25 \u00d7 8 = 200 photos.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of repeated addition: 25 plus 25 is 50, plus 25 is 75, plus 25 is 100, plus 25 is 125, plus 25 is 150, plus 25 is 175, plus another 25 is 200. So, again, that confirms it's 200 photos in total.\n\nI don't see any reason why division or subtraction would be applicable here. Division might be useful if I were trying to find out how many photos are in each book, given the total number of photos and the number of books. But in this problem, I already know the number of books and photos per book, so multiplication is the way to go.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the units. If each photo book has 25 photos, and there are 8 books, then combining them should give a total number of photos. Multiplying 25 photos/book by 8 books gives 200 photos. Adding 8 to 25 would give 33, which would be like having 8 extra photos beyond one full book, but that doesn't align with the problem's setup.\n\nSubtracting 8 from 25, 25 - 8 = 17, that might make sense if I were reducing the number of photos per book by 8, but again, that's not what's being asked here.\n\nDividing 25 by 8, 25 \u00f7 8 = 3.125, which could represent the number of photos per book if there were 8 total photos, but that doesn't fit the problem's description.\n\nTherefore, the only logical expression to find the total number of photos Bella has is D. 25 \u00d7 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
