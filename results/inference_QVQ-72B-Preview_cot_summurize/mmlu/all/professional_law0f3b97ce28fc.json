                    "text": "So I've got this contract between a homeowner and a house painter. The painter is supposed to paint the house with off-white latex paint and finish the job within 30 days. If the homeowner is satisfied with the job, they have to pay $10,000 within a week after the job is completed. Now, the question is asking which statement accurately describes the homeowner's obligation to pay the $10,000.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each option means in terms of contract law.\n\nOption A says that payment of $10,000 by the homeowner is an express condition precedent to the house painter's duty of performance. Hmm, a condition precedent is something that must happen before a party's duty to perform arises. So, in this case, it would mean that the homeowner's payment is dependent on something happening first, probably the painter finishing the job satisfactorily.\n\nBut wait, the contract says that if the homeowner finds the completed job satisfactory, they will pay $10,000. So, the payment is contingent upon the job being completed to the homeowner's satisfaction.\n\nOption B mentions an express condition subsequent. A condition subsequent is something that, if it occurs after the performance, can discharge a party's obligation. But in this scenario, it's about the homeowner's obligation to pay after the job is done, not something that could happen later to void the payment.\n\nOption C says that the painter's performance is an express condition precedent to the homeowner's duty of payment. This seems similar to option A but phrased differently. It means that the painter has to perform first, and only then does the homeowner have to pay.\n\nOption D talks about concurrent conditions, meaning that both parties' performances are interdependent and supposed to happen at the same time.\n\nGiven this, I need to see which one best describes the homeowner's payment obligation.\n\nLooking back at the contract, it clearly states that the painter will paint the house and finish within 30 days, and if the homeowner is satisfied with the completed job, they will pay $10,000 within a week after the job is completed.\n\nSo, the painter's performance (painting the house satisfactorily) is a condition that must be met before the homeowner's duty to pay arises. Therefore, the painter's performance is a condition precedent to the homeowner's payment.\n\nThis aligns with option C: \"The house painter's performance under the contract would be an express condition precedent to the homeowner's duty of payment of the $10,000.\"\n\nOption A is somewhat similar but phrased differently. It says that the homeowner's payment is a condition precedent to the painter's duty of performance. But that doesn't make sense because the painter has to paint the house first, and then get paid. So, actually, the painter's performance is preceding the homeowner's payment.\n\nOption B is about a condition subsequent, which isn't relevant here because we're dealing with conditions that need to be met before the payment, not after.\n\nOption D suggests that both parties' performances are concurrent, which isn't the case here. The painter has to paint the house first, and then the homeowner pays after inspecting the work.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is option C: The house painter's performance under the contract would be an express condition precedent to the homeowner's duty of payment of the $10,000.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
