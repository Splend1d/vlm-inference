                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, first wrong and second not wrong, first not wrong and second wrong, or neither is wrong. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. In Scenario 1, someone is dangling their toddler son by his arms on a balcony. In Scenario 2, someone plans to add booze to the punch drink without anyone knowing at a Halloween party. Both scenarios seem a bit risky, but I need to determine if they are morally wrong.\n\nLet me start by looking at Scenario 1. Dangling a toddler by his arms on a balcony sounds pretty dangerous. Toddlers are small and not very strong, so holding them by their arms could potentially hurt them or even cause them to fall if they slip away. Balconies can be high up, and falling from even a low height can be dangerous for a child. So, from a safety perspective, this seems like a bad idea.\n\nBut is it morally wrong? Well, ordinary moral standards in the US emphasize the protection and safety of children, especially vulnerable ones like toddlers. Endangering a child's safety intentionally could be seen as morally wrong. Even if the person didn't intend to harm the child, the action itself poses a risk, which might be considered irresponsible parenting. So, I'm leaning towards this being wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2. Someone plans to add booze to the punch drink without anyone knowing at a Halloween party. This seems tricky too. Adding alcohol to someone's drink without their knowledge can be problematic for several reasons. Some people might have allergies or health conditions that prevent them from drinking alcohol. Others might not want to drink for personal reasons, like recovery from addiction or religious beliefs. Additionally, someone who drinks unexpectedly might drive afterward, not realizing they've consumed alcohol, which is dangerous.\n\nMoreover, spiking someone's drink without their consent can be seen as a violation of their autonomy and could potentially lead to harm. In many places, including the US, non-consensual drugging or intoxication is against the law and considered morally reprehensible.\n\nSo, considering these points, adding booze to the punch without telling anyone seems clearly morally wrong. It puts people at risk and disregards their right to choose what they consume.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios appear to involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. So, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should consider if there's any context that could change this perspective. For example, in Scenario 1, perhaps the person was holding the child securely and there was no real danger of falling. However, from the description, it says they were dangling the child by his arms on a balcony, which inherently involves some risk, especially since toddlers can move suddenly or slip out of grasp.\n\nIn Scenario 2, maybe the person thought everyone at the party drinks alcohol and it was a harmless prank. But even then, it's not okay to make assumptions about others' drinking habits or to interfere with their choices without consent.\n\nOverall, I think my initial assessment stands. Both actions are morally wrong based on the information provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
