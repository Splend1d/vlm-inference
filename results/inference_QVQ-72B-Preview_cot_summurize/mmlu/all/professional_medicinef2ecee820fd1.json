                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this legal case involving a patient who had a hysterectomy and now has a surgical sponge left in her pelvis. The radiologist confirmed that the sponge shouldn't be there unless there was negligence. Now, in the malpractice suit, the patient is invoking a legal concept, and I need to figure out which one from the options provided: collateral estoppel, proximate cause, res ipsa loquitur, or respondeat superior.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these terms means:\n\nA. Collateral estoppel: I think this has to do with preventing someone from relitigating an issue that's already been decided in a previous case. But that doesn't seem to fit here because this is the first time the issue is being brought up, right? The patient is bringing this case for the first time, so there's no previous litigation to estop.\n\nB. Proximate cause: This is about causation in law, where there's a direct link between the action (or inaction) and the harm caused. In this case, the leaving of the sponge during surgery caused the patient's chronic pelvic pain. So, proximate cause seems relevant, but I think there's a more direct legal concept that applies here.\n\nC. Res ipsa loquitur: This Latin phrase means \"the thing speaks for itself.\" I recall that it's a doctrine used in negligence cases where the mere fact of certain kinds of accidents or injuries occurring is prima facie evidence of negligence. Essentially, it shifts the burden of proof to the defendant to show that they weren't negligent because the injury wouldn't have occurred without negligence.\n\nD. Respondeat superior: This is another Latin term meaning \"let the master answer.\" It's the doctrine that holds employers liable for the actions of their employees done in the course of employment. While this could be relevant in a medical malpractice case, it seems like it's more about the relationship between the employer and employee, not directly about the act of negligence itself.\n\nGiven the scenario, where a surgical sponge was left in the patient's pelvis after a hysterectomy, and it's established that this couldn't have happened without negligence, it seems like res ipsa loquitur is the most appropriate term to describe the legal concept being invoked.\n\nLet me double-check. Res ipsa loquitur is typically invoked when:\n\n1. The injury is one that doesn't ordinarily occur without negligence.\n\n2. The instrumentality causing the injury was exclusively under the control of the defendant.\n\n3. The plaintiff wasn't involved in causing the injury.\n\nIn this case, leaving a surgical sponge inside a patient is a clear example of something that doesn't happen without negligence. The surgery was performed by the medical team, so they had exclusive control over the instruments and sponges used. The patient was under anesthesia and couldn't have contributed to the error. Therefore, res ipsa loquitur would apply, shifting the burden to the defendant (the hospital or surgeon) to prove that they weren't negligent.\n\nProximate cause is certainly a component of the case, as it needs to be established that the sponge caused the patient's pain. However, res ipsa loquitur is a specific doctrine that helps establish negligence in cases like this, where the negligence is inferred from the nature of the incident.\n\nCollateral estoppel doesn't apply because there's no prior litigation to prevent relitigation of the same issue.\n\nRespondeat superior might come into play if the surgeon was an employee of the hospital, but that's more about who is legally responsible for the negligence, not about proving the negligence itself.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is res ipsa loquitur.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. res ipsa loquitur}} \\]"
