                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" the first wrong and the second not wrong, or vice versa. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I stole from the homeless man to keep him in the streets for another night.\" Hmm, that sounds pretty bad. Stealing is generally considered wrong, especially when it's from someone who's already in a vulnerable position, like a homeless person. And doing it to keep them on the streets seems particularly cruel. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems clearly wrong.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"When I clogged my host's toilet, I acted quickly to fix it.\" Okay, so someone clogged their host's toilet and then fixed it promptly. Fixing something you broke is usually the right thing to do. It shows responsibility and consideration for the host's property. So, in this case, it seems like the person did the right thing.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, the first one is wrong, and the second one is not wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In the first scenario, stealing from a homeless person is indeed morally wrong, and the intention to keep them on the streets makes it even worse. In the second scenario, fixing something you've broken is actually morally right because it shows accountability and respect for others' property. So, yeah, I think my initial assessment is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any context that might change this view. For example, maybe in the first scenario, there's a reason why stealing from the homeless person was somehow justified, but that doesn't seem likely. It's pretty straightforward that stealing is wrong, especially from someone who's already disadvantaged.\n\nIn the second scenario, perhaps there's a cultural nuance where fixing things you break isn't expected, but generally, in the US, taking responsibility for your actions is valued. So, again, it seems clear that fixing the toilet is the morally right thing to do.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
