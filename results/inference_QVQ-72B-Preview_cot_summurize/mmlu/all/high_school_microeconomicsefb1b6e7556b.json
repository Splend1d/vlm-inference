                    "text": "So I have this question about the principle of diminishing marginal utility. I need to choose which statement correctly describes this principle. Let me see what the options are.\n\nOption A says that marginal utility stays the same. Hmm, I think diminishing marginal utility means that as you consume more of a good, the additional satisfaction you get from each extra unit decreases. So, if marginal utility stays the same, that doesn't sound right.\n\nOption B says that total utility stays the same. But from what I remember, total utility usually increases as you consume more, even if the marginal utility decreases. So, this probably isn't correct.\n\nOption C says that marginal utility decreases with each additional unit of a good that is consumed. This seems to align with what I know about diminishing marginal utility. The more you have of something, the less extra happiness or satisfaction you get from each extra unit.\n\nOption D says that both marginal utility and total utility decrease. But I don't think that's accurate. Total utility might keep increasing, just at a decreasing rate.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the correct answer is Option C. Marginal utility decreases with each additional unit of a good that is consumed.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe I should recall the definitions to be sure.\n\nMarginal utility is the additional satisfaction gained from consuming one more unit of a good or service. Total utility is the total satisfaction received from consuming a particular quantity of that good or service.\n\nThe law of diminishing marginal utility states that as a person consumes more and more units of a good, the additional satisfaction from each successive unit decreases.\n\nSo, in simpler terms, if you eat one slice of pizza, you get a lot of satisfaction. The second slice gives you a bit less satisfaction than the first, and the third slice gives you even less than the second, and so on.\n\nSo, in this case, marginal utility is decreasing with each additional unit consumed, which is Option C.\n\nBut what about total utility? Does it stay the same or decrease?\n\nWell, total utility is the sum of all the marginal utilities from each unit consumed. So, even if the marginal utility decreases, as long as it's still positive, total utility should be increasing, just at a decreasing rate.\n\nFor example, if marginal utility for the first unit is 10, second is 8, third is 6, fourth is 4, and so on, total utility would be 10 + 8 + 6 + 4 = 28, which is increasing, not staying the same or decreasing.\n\nTherefore, Option B is incorrect because total utility doesn't stay the same; it increases as long as marginal utility is positive.\n\nOption A is incorrect because marginal utility does not stay the same; it decreases with each additional unit.\n\nOption D is incorrect because total utility doesn't decrease; it increases, even if at a decreasing rate.\n\nSo, again, Option C seems to be the correct choice.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any scenario where marginal utility might stay the same or increase with additional units consumed.\n\nIn standard economic theory, the law of diminishing marginal utility assumes that marginal utility decreases with additional consumption, assuming all else is equal.\n\nHowever, there might be exceptions in real life. For example, if a person is very hungry, the first few slices of pizza give high marginal utility, and then it decreases. But if they haven't eaten in a while, maybe the third slice gives them more satisfaction than the second, but generally, the trend is downward.\n\nMoreover, for certain goods, marginal utility might increase with consumption in some cases. For instance, if you're collecting items, each additional item might add more to your satisfaction than the previous one. But this is not the general case, and the law of diminishing marginal utility holds for most consumption goods.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the principle of diminishing marginal utility is that marginal utility decreases with each additional unit of a good that is consumed.\n\nSo, the answer is Option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
