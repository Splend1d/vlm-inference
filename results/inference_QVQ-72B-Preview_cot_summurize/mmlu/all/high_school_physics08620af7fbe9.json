                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem here about a sphere and a block sliding down an inclined plane. Both have the same mass, and the sphere rolls without slipping, while the block slides without friction. I need to figure out which one reaches the bottom first. There are four options, but I think I can eliminate some of them.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how motion down an inclined plane works for different objects, especially considering whether they roll or slide.\n\nSo, for the block that slides without friction, its motion is purely translational. The force driving it down the incline is the component of its weight parallel to the plane, which is m*g*sin(theta), where m is mass, g is gravity, and theta is the angle of the incline.\n\nSince there's no friction, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy of translation. So, by conservation of energy:\n\nm*g*h = (1/2)*m*v_block^2\n\nWhere h is the vertical height of the incline. Solving for v_block, the velocity of the block at the bottom, I get:\n\nv_block = sqrt(2*g*h)\n\nBut wait, that's not quite right. Actually, I should consider the height in terms of the incline's dimensions. Let's say the vertical height is h, and the length of the incline is l. Then, h = l*sin(theta).\n\nSo, m*g*h = (1/2)*m*v_block^2\n\nPlugging in h:\n\nm*g*l*sin(theta) = (1/2)*m*v_block^2\n\nThe masses cancel out:\n\ng*l*sin(theta) = (1/2)*v_block^2\n\nSo, v_block^2 = 2*g*l*sin(theta)\n\nThus, v_block = sqrt(2*g*l*sin(theta))\n\nNow, the time taken to slide down the incline can be found using the equation of motion:\n\nl = (1/2)*a*t^2\n\nWhere a is the acceleration down the inclate, and t is time.\n\nThe acceleration a for the block is:\n\na_block = g*sin(theta)\n\nPlugging into the equation:\n\nl = (1/2)*g*sin(theta)*t^2\n\nSolving for t:\n\nt_block = sqrt(2*l / (g*sin(theta)))\n\nOkay, that's the time for the block.\n\nNow, for the sphere, which rolls without slipping, its motion is a combination of translational and rotational motion.\n\nIn this case, the sphere has both translational kinetic energy and rotational kinetic energy.\n\nThe moment of inertia for a solid sphere is (2/5)*m*r^2.\n\nThe condition for rolling without slipping is that v_sphere = r*omega, where omega is the angular velocity.\n\nThe total kinetic energy for the sphere is:\n\nK_total = (1/2)*m*v_sphere^2 + (1/2)*I*omega^2\n\nSubstituting I = (2/5)*m*r^2 and omega = v_sphere / r:\n\nK_total = (1/2)*m*v_sphere^2 + (1/2)*(2/5)*m*r^2*(v_sphere / r)^2\n\nSimplify:\n\nK_total = (1/2)*m*v_sphere^2 + (1/5)*m*v_sphere^2 = (7/10)*m*v_sphere^2\n\nNow, by conservation of energy, the potential energy at the top is equal to the total kinetic energy at the bottom:\n\nm*g*h = (7/10)*m*v_sphere^2\n\nAgain, h = l*sin(theta), so:\n\nm*g*l*sin(theta) = (7/10)*m*v_sphere^2\n\nMasses cancel:\n\ng*l*sin(theta) = (7/10)*v_sphere^2\n\nSo, v_sphere^2 = (10/7)*g*l*sin(theta)\n\nThus, v_sphere = sqrt((10/7)*g*l*sin(theta))\n\nNow, to find the time taken for the sphere to roll down the incline, I need to find its acceleration.\n\nFor rolling without slipping, the acceleration a_sphere is given by:\n\na_sphere = g*sin(theta)*(1 / (1 + I/(m*r^2)))\n\nFor a sphere, I/(m*r^2) = (2/5), so:\n\na_sphere = g*sin(theta)*(1 / (1 + 2/5)) = g*sin(theta)*(5/7)\n\nNow, using the equation of motion:\n\nl = (1/2)*a_sphere*t^2\n\nPlugging in a_sphere:\n\nl = (1/2)*(5/7)*g*sin(theta)*t^2\n\nSo, t_sphere = sqrt(14*l / (5*g*sin(theta)))\n\nNow, comparing t_block and t_sphere:\n\nt_block = sqrt(2*l / (g*sin(theta)))\n\nt_sphere = sqrt(14*l / (5*g*sin(theta))) = sqrt(14/5 * 2*l / (g*sin(theta))) = sqrt(28/5 / (2/1)) = sqrt(28/5) * sqrt(2/1) = sqrt(56/5)\n\nWait, that seems messy. Maybe I should just compare the two times directly.\n\nLet's take the ratio t_sphere / t_block:\n\nt_sphere / t_block = sqrt(14/5) / sqrt(2) = sqrt(14/5 * 1/2) = sqrt(14/10) = sqrt(7/5) > 1\n\nSo, t_sphere > t_block\n\nMeaning the block reaches the bottom first.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The sphere, because it gains rotational kinetic energy, but the block does not.\n\nWell, yes, the sphere gains rotational kinetic energy, which means some of its potential energy goes into rotation, slowing down its translational speed compared to the block. So, the sphere takes longer.\n\nB. The sphere, because it gains mechanical energy due to the torque exerted on it, but the block does not.\n\nWait, both gain mechanical energy, but the sphere has rotational energy, which is part of its total mechanical energy. But the block only has translational kinetic energy.\n\nC. The block, because it does not lose mechanical energy due to friction, but the sphere does.\n\nNo, there's no friction mentioned for either object. The sphere rolls without slipping, so no energy is lost to friction. The block slides without friction, so no energy is lost there either. Both conserve mechanical energy.\n\nD. The block, because it does not gain rotational kinetic energy, but the sphere does.\n\nYes, exactly. The block only has translational kinetic energy, while the sphere has both translational and rotational kinetic energy, so its translational speed is less for the same potential energy conversion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
