There does not exist an uncountable subset E of R such that f is nondifferentiable at every x \u2208 E.\n\nD. None of the above.\"\n\nAlright, let's break this down. So, we have a function f that's bounded and Lebesgue integrable on the real line. I need to figure out what must be true about this function based on these properties.\n\nFirst off, f is bounded. That means there's some number M such that |f(x)| \u2264 M for all x in R. Also, it's Lebesgue integrable, which implies that the Lebesgue integral of |f| over R is finite. So, \u222b_R |f(x)| dx < \u221e.\n\nNow, option A says that f is Riemann integrable. I know that Lebesgue integrability is more general than Riemann integrability; in fact, every Riemann integrable function is Lebesgue integrable, but not necessarily the other way around. So, having Lebesgue integrability doesn't automatically imply Riemann integrability. Moreover, boundedness is a necessary condition for Riemann integrability on a finite interval, but here we're dealing with the entire real line, which is infinite. I'm a bit unsure about Riemann integrability on the whole real line. Maybe I need to look into that.\n\nWait, actually, the standard definition of Riemann integrability is usually defined on finite intervals. For the whole real line, people might talk about improper integrals, but that's a bit different. So, perhaps saying that f is Riemann integrable on R might not make sense strictly speaking, but maybe the question is using it loosely to mean that the improper integral exists. Anyway, I think I should consider whether f being bounded and Lebesgue integrable implies that it's Riemann integrable in some sense.\n\nLet me think about examples. Is there a function that's bounded and Lebesgue integrable on R but not Riemann integrable? Hmm. Maybe something like the characteristic function of the rationals, but that's not bounded. Wait, the characteristic function of the rationals is 0 almost everywhere, but it's not bounded because it's 1 at rationals and 0 elsewhere, so it's bounded, actually. But it's not Lebesgue integrable on R because the measure of the rationals is infinite. So, that doesn't help.\n\nWhat if I take a bounded function that's discontinuous on a set of measure zero? I think such a function would be Riemann integrable, because Riemann integrability requires the set of discontinuities to have Lebesgue measure zero. But in this case, f is Lebesgue integrable, which is a stronger condition than just having a set of discontinuities of measure zero.\n\nWait, no. Lebesgue integrability doesn't directly tell me about the set of discontinuities of the function. It just says that the function is measurable and its absolute value has a finite integral.\n\nMaybe I should recall the theorem about Riemann integrability. A bounded function on a finite interval is Riemann integrable if and only if it's continuous almost everywhere, meaning the set of points where it's discontinuous has measure zero. But here, we're dealing with the entire real line, which is not a finite interval. So, I'm not sure if that directly applies.\n\nPerhaps I need to think about the properties of Lebesgue integrable functions on R. Since f is bounded and Lebesgue integrable, it means that \u222b_R |f(x)| dx is finite. But does that imply anything about its Riemann integrability?\n\nLet me consider the function f(x) = (sin x)/x. This function is Lebesgue integrable on R, and it's bounded (since |sin x| \u2264 |x| for x \u2260 0, but actually, that's not right. Wait, |sin x| \u2264 1 always, so (|sin x|)/|x| \u2264 1/|x|, but that doesn't help directly. Actually, (sin x)/x is bounded because the limit as x approaches 0 is 1, and elsewhere it's continuous and bounded by 1 in magnitude. Moreover, it's Lebesgue integrable on R, but is it Riemann integrable?\n\nWait, actually, (sin x)/x is not Riemann integrable on R because the integral doesn't converge in the improper sense. The Lebesgue integral exists because the positive and negative parts are both infinite, but the absolute value integral is infinite, so it's not Lebesgue integrable. Wait, no, that can't be right. If a function is Lebesgue integrable, then its integral is finite. Maybe I need to choose another example.\n\nLet me try f(x) = e^{-|x|}. This function is bounded (since e^{-|x|} \u2264 1 for all x), continuous everywhere, and its integral from -\u221e to \u221e is finite. So, it's Lebesgue integrable. Is it Riemann integrable? Well, since it's continuous everywhere, yes, it should be Riemann integrable on any finite interval, but on the whole real line, the improper integral would converge, so I think it's Riemann integrable in that sense.\n\nBut maybe there are functions that are bounded and Lebesgue integrable but not Riemann integrable on R. I'm not sure. Maybe I need to look for a different approach.\n\nLet's consider option B: \"There does not exist a countably infinite E of R such that f is nondifferentiable at every x \u2208 E.\"\n\nSo, this is saying that it's impossible for f to be nondifferentiable at every point in a countably infinite set E.\n\nSimilarly, option C: \"There does not exist an uncountable subset E of R such that f is nondifferentiable at every x \u2208 E.\"\n\nThis is saying that it's impossible for f to be nondifferentiable at every point in an uncountable set E.\n\nHmm. So, both B and C are about the differentiability of f. I need to think about how boundedness and Lebesgue integrability relate to the differentiability of f.\n\nFirst, Lebesgue integrability is about the integrability of the function with respect to measure, whereas differentiability is a pointwise property related to the existence of a derivative.\n\nBoundedness doesn't directly imply anything about differentiability. For example, the function f(x) = 1 is bounded and everywhere differentiable, while a function like f(x) = |x| is bounded but not differentiable at x = 0.\n\nBut in this problem, f is required to be bounded and Lebesgue integrable. Does that place any restrictions on its differentiability?\n\nMaybe I should recall some theorems about differentiability and Lebesgue integrability. I know that for a function to be Riemann integrable on a finite interval, it must be bounded and continuous almost everywhere. But again, we're dealing with the entire real line, which is not a finite interval.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the set where f is not differentiable. Can that set be countably infinite? Or uncountable?\n\nLet me consider a specific example. Take f(x) = |x|, which is bounded and Lebesgue integrable on R (its integral is finite). It's not differentiable at x = 0. So, there exists a finite set (in this case, a single point) where it's not differentiable. But option B says \"there does not exist a countably infinite E,\" so it's allowing finite sets, I think. Wait, countably infinite means infinite but countable, so finite sets are not countably infinite. So, in this example, f is not differentiable only at x = 0, which is a finite set, so option B wouldn't be violated.\n\nWait, no. Option B says \"there does not exist a countably infinite E of R such that f is nondifferentiable at every x \u2208 E.\" So, it's claiming that such a set cannot exist for this function. In the case of f(x) = |x|, the set where it's not differentiable is {0}, which is finite, not countably infinite. So, this doesn't violate option B.\n\nSimilarly, if I construct a function that's not differentiable at a countably infinite number of points, would that be possible?\n\nLet me think about the Weierstrass function, which is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere. But that's not bounded and Lebesgue integrable on R, I don't think. Wait, the Weierstrass function is bounded (since it's continuous on R and lim |x|\u2192\u221e f(x) exists), but is it Lebesgue integrable on R? Probably not, because its integral would be infinite.\n\nWait, no. The Weierstrass function is bounded, say between -M and M, so |f(x)| \u2264 M for all x. Its Lebesgue integral would be \u222b_R |f(x)| dx \u2264 \u222b_R M dx = M * \u221e = \u221e, which is not finite. So, it's not Lebesgue integrable on R. Therefore, it doesn't satisfy the conditions of the problem.\n\nSo, maybe I need to find a function that's bounded and Lebesgue integrable but not differentiable on a countably infinite set.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps such a function cannot exist, which would make option B true.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the set of points where f is not differentiable. If f is not differentiable on a countably infinite set, does that affect its Lebesgue integrability?\n\nI'm not sure. Differentiability is a pointwise property, and Lebesgue integrability is more about the global behavior of the function with respect to measure.\n\nPerhaps the differentiability of f doesn't directly influence its Lebesgue integrability, as long as the function is measurable and its absolute value is integrable.\n\nSo, maybe option B is not necessarily true.\n\nWhat about option C: \"There does not exist an uncountable subset E of R such that f is nondifferentiable at every x \u2208 E.\"\n\nSo, this is saying that f cannot be not differentiable on an uncountable set E.\n\nAgain, considering the Weierstrass function, it's not differentiable anywhere, which is an uncountable set, but as we saw, it's not Lebesgue integrable on R. So, that doesn't help.\n\nIs there a function that's bounded and Lebesgue integrable on R but not differentiable on an uncountable set?\n\nLet me think about the Cantor function. The Cantor function is bounded (it's between 0 and 1), continuous everywhere, but not differentiable on the Cantor set, which is uncountable. But is the Cantor function Lebesgue integrable on R?\n\nThe Cantor function is zero outside [0,1], and on [0,1], it's 1/2. So, its integral from -\u221e to \u221e is the integral from 0 to 1 of 1/2, which is 1/2. So, yes, it's Lebesgue integrable on R.\n\nWait, but the Cantor function is not bounded; it's between 0 and 1, so it is bounded. And it's Lebesgue integrable on R. Moreover, it's not differentiable on the Cantor set, which is uncountable.\n\nSo, this would be a counterexample to option C: there exists an uncountable set E (the Cantor set) where f is not differentiable, and f is bounded and Lebesgue integrable on R.\n\nTherefore, option C is not necessarily true.\n\nNow, going back to option B: does there exist a countably infinite set E where f is not differentiable?\n\nIn the case of the Cantor function, the set where it's not differentiable is the Cantor set, which is uncountable. So, it's also countably infinite in a way, but the Cantor set is uncountable. Wait, no, the Cantor set is uncountable; it has the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nSo, in this case, f is not differentiable on an uncountable set, but what about countably infinite sets?\n\nIs it possible for f to be not differentiable on a countably infinite set?\n\nLet me consider constructing such a function.\n\nSuppose I have a countably infinite set E, say the rationals, and I define f to be not differentiable at each point in E.\n\nFor example, f(x) = 0 if x is irrational, and f(x) = 1/n if x is rational and x = m/n in lowest terms.\n\nIs this function bounded and Lebesgue integrable on R?\n\nWell, it's bounded between 0 and 1. But is it Lebesgue integrable on R?\n\nThe function is zero almost everywhere (since the rationals have measure zero), so its Lebesgue integral is zero. So, yes, it's Lebesgue integrable.\n\nBut in this case, f is not differentiable at every rational number, which is a countably infinite set.\n\nSo, this would be a counterexample to option B: there exists a countably infinite set E where f is not differentiable, and f is bounded and Lebesgue integrable on R.\n\nTherefore, option B is not necessarily true.\n\nNow, option A: f is Riemann integrable.\n\nBased on earlier thoughts, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's not necessarily true.\n\nConsidering the function f(x) = (sin x)/x, which is Lebesgue integrable but not Riemann integrable on R, but earlier I thought that (sin x)/x is not Lebesgue integrable on R, but actually, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's think carefully.\n\nThe function (sin x)/x is not Lebesgue integrable on R because \u222b_R |(sin x)/x| dx = \u221e.\n\nBut is it Riemann integrable in some sense?\n\nWell, the improper integral \u222b_{-\u221e}^{\u221e} (sin x)/x dx converges to \u03c0, but this is an improper Riemann integral, not a proper Riemann integral.\n\nSo, in that sense, it's Riemann integrable as an improper integral.\n\nBut since it's not absolutely integrable, it's not Lebesgue integrable.\n\nTherefore, this function is Riemann integrable (improperly) but not Lebesgue integrable.\n\nBut in our problem, f is assumed to be Lebesgue integrable, so this example doesn't apply.\n\nSo, perhaps if f is bounded and Lebesgue integrable on R, then it must be Riemann integrable in some sense.\n\nWait, but Riemann integrability is typically defined on finite intervals.\n\nFor the whole real line, people talk about improper integrals.\n\nSo, maybe the question is whether f is improperly Riemann integrable on R.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering Riemann integrability in the sense that for any finite interval, the function is Riemann integrable, and the improper integral over R converges.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that if f is bounded and Lebesgue integrable on R, then it must be that the improper integral \u222b_{-\u221e}^{\u221e} f(x) dx converges, which would make it Riemann integrable in that sense.\n\nBut is that necessarily true?\n\nConsider the function f(x) = (cos x)/x^{1.1}. This function is bounded (since |cos x| \u2264 |x|^{1.1} for x \u2260 0, but actually, |cos x| \u2264 1, and |x|^{1.1} approaches infinity as x approaches zero, so that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, no. For x near zero, |x|^{1.1} is small, so |cos x|/|x|^{1.1} is large near zero, which means the function is unbounded near zero. So, that's not a good example.\n\nI need a function that's bounded and Lebesgue integrable on R but not Riemann integrable in some sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all bounded Lebesgue integrable functions on R are Riemann integrable in the improper sense.\n\nI need to check that.\n\nLet me look up whether a bounded function that's Lebesgue integrable on R is necessarily Riemann integrable in the improper sense.\n\nAfter a quick search in my notes, I recall that for a bounded function on the real line, Lebesgue integrability does not imply the convergence of the improper Riemann integral. There are functions that are Lebesgue integrable but their improper Riemann integrals do not converge.\n\nFor example, the function f(x) = (sin x)/x is Lebesgue integrable on R only if its absolute value integral is finite, but as we saw, \u222b_{-\u221e}^{\u221e} |(sin x)/x| dx = \u221e, so it's not Lebesgue integrable. However, the improper integral \u222b_{-\u221e}^{\u221e} (sin x)/x dx converges to \u03c0. So, in this case, the function is not Lebesgue integrable but has a convergent improper Riemann integral.\n\nWait, but in our problem, f is assumed to be Lebesgue integrable, so this example doesn't apply.\n\nI need an example of a function that's bounded, Lebesgue integrable on R, but its improper Riemann integral does not converge.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me consider f(x) = (sin x)/x^2. This function is bounded (since |sin x| \u2264 |x|^2 for x \u2260 0, but actually, |sin x| \u2264 1, and |x|^2 approaches infinity as x approaches zero, so |sin x|/|x|^2 is unbounded near zero. So, that doesn't work.\n\nWait, no. As x approaches zero, |sin x|/|x|^2 = |(sin x)/x| / |x|, and |sin x|/x approaches 1, so |sin x|/x^2 approaches infinity as x approaches zero. So, the function is not bounded near zero. Not a good example.\n\nMaybe f(x) = (sin x)/x^{1.5}. Again, near zero, |sin x|/|x|^{1.5} approaches infinity, so not bounded.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(x) = (sin x^2)/x. Let's see: |sin x^2| \u2264 |x|, so |f(x)| \u2264 1, which is bounded. Is it Lebesgue integrable on R?\n\nThe integral \u222b_{-\u221e}^{\u221e} |("
