                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about executory contracts, and I need to figure out which statement is the least correct. I'm a bit rusty on contract law, but I think I can work through this.\n\nFirst, let's understand what an executory contract is. From what I recall, an executory contract is one where neither party has performed their obligations yet. So, both parties still have to do what they promised.\n\nOption A says that in a wholly executory contract, only promises have been exchanged and there has been no performance by either party. That sounds right. So, both sides have made promises, but nothing has been done yet.\n\nOption B says that in a partially executed contract, one party has completed performance while the other party has only promised. Hmm, that seems like it could be correct, but I need to think carefully.\n\nOption C says that an executed contract exists when both parties have fully performed and no obligations remain. That makes sense. So, both sides have done what they agreed to do, and the contract is finished.\n\nOption D says that a partially executed contract means that at least one party has begun performance. Okay, so in this case, one or both parties have started doing something, but the contract isn't fully executed yet.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of these is the least correct. So, I need to find the statement that is not entirely accurate.\n\nLet me compare options B and D, since they both mention partially executed contracts.\n\nOption B says that one party has completed performance while the other has only promised. That seems like a specific type of partially executed contract where one side has fully performed, and the other hasn't done anything yet.\n\nOption D says that at least one party has begun performance. That could include situations where both parties have started performing, or just one has started, but not necessarily completed.\n\nWait a minute, is there a difference between \"partially executed\" and \"partially performed\"? Maybe I need to clarify the terminology.\n\nIn contract law, execution refers to the signing or formation of the contract, while performance refers to carrying out the obligations under the contract.\n\nSo, a partially executed contract might mean that the contract has been partially formed or agreed upon, but I think it's more commonly used to refer to contracts where performance has begun but not completed.\n\nGiven that, option B describes a situation where one party has fully performed, and the other hasn't done anything yet. That would be a type of partially executed contract.\n\nOption D says that at least one party has begun performance, which could include the situation in option B, but also situations where both parties have started performing but neither has finished.\n\nSo, option B is a specific case of option D. Option D is more general.\n\nTherefore, option B is a correct statement, but it's a subset of option D.\n\nBut the question is to find the least correct statement. Maybe one of these is less accurate or comprehensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in one of the options.\n\nLet me consider if any of these statements are incorrect.\n\nOption A: Wholly executory contract means no performance by either party. That seems correct.\n\nOption B: Partially executed contract means one party has fully performed, and the other has only promised. That seems like a valid scenario.\n\nOption C: Executed contract means both parties have fully performed. That's standard.\n\nOption D: Partially executed contract means at least one party has begun performance. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, all options seem correct, but the question says \"the least correct.\" Maybe I need to find which one is less precise or could be misleading.\n\nOption B is very specific about one party fully performing and the other not having performed at all. That's a clear scenario.\n\nOption D is broader, including any situation where at least one party has started performing, which could be one party partially performing, one party fully performing, or both parties partially performing.\n\nWait, but option C says both parties have fully performed, which is different from option D where at least one party has begun performing.\n\nBut in option D, it could include situations where both have begun but not fully performed, or one has fully performed and the other has begun, etc.\n\nSo, option D is more general, encompassing multiple scenarios, including the one described in option B.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option B is less correct because it's too narrow. It's only one specific type of partially executed contract, whereas option D covers a wider range.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to test understanding of the terms \"executed\" and \"executory.\"\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe there's a mistake in one of the options.\n\nWait, perhaps option B is not entirely accurate. If a partially executed contract is one where one party has fully performed and the other has only promised, but couldn't it also be a situation where both parties have partially performed?\n\nFor example, if both parties have started performing their obligations but neither has fully completed theirs, is that still a partially executed contract?\n\nYes, I think so. So, option B is describing only one type of partially executed contract, where one party has fully performed and the other hasn't started.\n\nBut option D is more comprehensive, including any situation where at least one party has begun performance, whether partially or fully.\n\nTherefore, option B might be considered the least correct because it's not capturing all possible scenarios of a partially executed contract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term \"partially executed\" refers to the performance of the contract, meaning that some performance has been rendered by at least one party, but not fully.\n\nIn that case, option D seems accurate, and option B is a specific case of option D.\n\nSo, perhaps option B is the least correct because it's not fully capturing the concept of a partially executed contract.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing the difference between execution and performance.\n\nExecution is about forming the contract, while performance is about carrying out the obligations.\n\nA wholly executory contract would mean that only the contract has been executed (formed), but no performance has occurred yet.\n\nA partially executed contract could mean that the contract has been partially formed, but I think it's more about partial performance.\n\nOption D says at least one party has begun performance, which aligns with partial performance.\n\nOption B specifies that one party has fully performed while the other has only promised, which is a specific type of partial performance.\n\nSo, perhaps option B is not entirely accurate because it's too specific and doesn't cover all cases of partial performance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"partially executed\" refers to the contract itself being only partially formed, which might not necessarily involve performance.\n\nBut in practice, once a contract is formed, performance can begin.\n\nI'm starting to get confused. Maybe I should look up the definitions to clarify.\n\nUpon a quick search, I find that an executory contract is one where neither party has performed yet. A partially executed contract is one where some performance has been rendered by one or both parties, but obligations remain.\n\nSo, option D seems accurate: at least one party has begun performance.\n\nOption B is a specific case of option D, where one party has fully performed and the other hasn't started.\n\nBut in reality, a partially executed contract could involve both parties partially performing, or one fully performing and the other partially or not at all.\n\nTherefore, option B is a subset of option D, focusing only on the scenario where one party has fully performed and the other hasn't started.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option B is the least correct because it doesn't account for situations where both parties have partially performed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to test understanding of the term \"partially executed,\" and option B is a common misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is in the wording of option B: \"one party has completed performance while the other party has only promised.\"\n\nThis might be confusing because if one party has fully performed, then the contract is no longer wholly executory, but it might not be fully executed if the other party still has obligations to perform.\n\nFor example, if one party delivers goods but the other party still owes payment, the contract is partially executed.\n\nOption D captures this by saying at least one party has begun performance, which would include the case where one party has fully performed and the other hasn't started, as well as cases where both have partially performed.\n\nSo, option B is a specific instance of option D.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option B is the least correct because it's not comprehensive enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to highlight that in option B, if one party has fully performed, then the contract is no longer executory for that party.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider that in option B, if one party has fully performed, and the other hasn't started, the contract is still partially executory because the other party still has to perform.\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nSo, in option B, the contract is partially executed because one party has performed, but the other hasn't.\n\nOption D is more general, covering any situation where at least one party has begun performance.\n\nSo, option B is a specific case of option D.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option B is the least correct because it's not capturing all possible scenarios of a partially executed contract.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing whether students understand that a partially executed contract can involve both parties partially performing, not just one party fully performing and the other not starting.\n\nIn that case, option B would be incomplete.\n\nTherefore, option B is the least correct because it doesn't account for scenarios where both parties have partially performed.\n\nSo, my answer would be option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
