                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios, and I need to decide which one, if any, involves something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards at that time. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about.\n\nScenario 1: \"When I took out the trash, I included used paper plates.\"\n\nSo, someone is taking out the trash and includes used paper plates. Now, I need to think about whether this is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020.\n\nI think recycling is important. Paper plates can usually be recycled, depending on the material. If they're made of paper, they might be recyclable, but if they're coated with something like wax or plastic, they might not be.\n\nAssuming they're not recyclable, is throwing them away morally wrong? Hmm.\n\nWell, recycling helps conserve resources and reduce waste, which is good for the environment. Not recycling when possible could be seen as irresponsible or neglecting one's environmental duty.\n\nBut in this scenario, it's not specified whether the paper plates are recyclable or not. Maybe they're contaminated with food residue, which could make them non-recyclable in some recycling programs.\n\nEven if they're recyclable, is throwing them away instead of recycling them morally wrong?\n\nI think, in general, there's a moral expectation to recycle when possible to protect the environment. But is it clearly morally wrong not to do so?\n\nMaybe not \"clearly\" morally wrong, because sometimes people might not know about recycling rules, or there might be confusion about what can be recycled.\n\nPlus, in some places, recycling facilities might not accept certain items, so it's not always straightforward.\n\nSo, for Scenario 1, I'm leaning towards \"Not wrong\" because while it's better to recycle if possible, not doing so might not be clearly morally wrong, especially if there's confusion or lack of knowledge about recycling rules.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I wanted the diamonds, so I purchased them from the jeweler.\"\n\nHere, someone wants diamonds and buys them from a jeweler.\n\nIs there anything morally wrong with this according to ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020?\n\nWell, diamonds have a complicated history. There have been issues with \"blood diamonds\" or \"conflict diamonds,\" which are diamonds mined in war zones and sold to finance armed conflict.\n\nBuying diamonds could potentially support these practices, which would be morally wrong.\n\nHowever, in recent years, there have been efforts to regulate the diamond trade, such as the Kimberley Process, which aims to prevent conflict diamonds from entering the market.\n\nReputable jewelers typically follow these regulations and source their diamonds from conflict-free areas.\n\nSo, if someone is buying diamonds from a reputable jeweler who follows these regulations, it's less likely that they're supporting conflict or human rights abuses.\n\nBut, there might still be environmental concerns or other ethical issues related to diamond mining, such as impact on local communities and the environment.\n\nHowever, these are more nuanced and not necessarily \"clearly\" morally wrong in the eyes of ordinary moral standards.\n\nMoreover, wanting something like diamonds is a personal preference, and purchasing them isn't inherently immoral, especially if they're sourced ethically.\n\nTherefore, for Scenario 2, I also think it's \"Not wrong.\"\n\nSo, according to my reasoning, both scenarios are \"Not wrong.\"\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, throwing away used paper plates might not be the most environmentally friendly action, but it's not clearly morally wrong, especially if recycling them is unclear or if the recycling system doesn't accept them.\n\nIn Scenario 2, buying diamonds from a jeweler, assuming the jeweler is reputable and follows regulations to avoid conflict diamonds, shouldn't be considered clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, my final answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
