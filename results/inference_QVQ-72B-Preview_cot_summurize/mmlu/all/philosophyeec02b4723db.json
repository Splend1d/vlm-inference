                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Anscombe and her view on \"moral obligation.\" The options are:\n\nA. The norms of a society.\n\nB. The feelings of an individual.\n\nC. The commands of God.\n\nD. No real concept at all.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who Anscombe is and what her stance on moral obligation is. I know that Elizabeth Anscombe was a prominent philosopher who contributed to ethics and the philosophy of action. She was known for her critique of modern moral philosophy, especially regarding the concept of moral obligation.\n\nLet me think about her famous paper, \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" which I believe is where she discusses this topic. In that paper, Anscombe argues against the prevailing moral frameworks of her time, particularly those that rely on the concept of duty or obligation derived from a divine lawgiver.\n\nWait, actually, I think she was critical of the way moral obligation was being used in modern philosophy, suggesting that it was based on a misunderstanding of the relationship between morality and divine command.\n\nSo, option C is \"the commands of God.\" Did Anscombe think that moral obligation is directly about divine commands?\n\nI think she was critical of moral philosophies that try to ground moral obligation in divine command, especially those that attempt to separate morality from religion. She argued that modern moral philosophy had failed to provide a coherent account of moral obligation without appealing to a divine lawgiver.\n\nBut does that mean she thinks moral obligation signifies the commands of God? I don't think so. I believe she was pointing out that without a divine lawgiver, the concept of moral obligation loses its foundation.\n\nSo, maybe option D: \"no real concept at all.\" Is that what she thought?\n\nWell, I don't think she believed that moral obligation is \"no real concept at all.\" Rather, she thought that the way moral obligation was being used in modern philosophy was incoherent or misplaced.\n\nShe might have thought that the concept of moral obligation, as it was being used, didn't refer to anything real or meaningful in the absence of a divine lawgiver.\n\nBut to say it signifies \"no real concept at all\" seems a bit strong. Maybe she thought it was empty or lacked a proper basis, but not that it signified nothing.\n\nLet me consider option A: \"the norms of a society.\"\n\nAnscombe was critical of moral theories that based obligation solely on social norms or conventions. She was skeptical of the idea that moral obligations could be derived solely from what society deems acceptable.\n\nSo, I don't think she would agree that moral obligation signifies the norms of society.\n\nWhat about option B: \"the feelings of an individual.\"\n\nThis seems related to emotional or sentiment-based ethics, which Anscombe might have been critical of as well. She was more aligned with Aristotelian and Thomistic traditions, which emphasize reason and virtue.\n\nShe probably didn't think that moral obligation is just about individual feelings.\n\nHmm, so none of these options seem to align perfectly with what I recall about Anscombe's views.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the question is referring to Anscombe's criticism that in modern moral philosophy, the concept of moral obligation has been detached from its proper foundation in divine law and has become an empty notion.\n\nIf that's the case, then option D: \"no real concept at all\" might be the closest to her view.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Let me see if I can find a specific quote from Anscombe that addresses this.\n\nIn \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" Anscombe writes: \"I shall try to indicate why it is that the concept of a moral obligation, or of moral duty, can be understood and can seem meaningful, even though in fact it is not meaningful.\"\n\nThis suggests that she thought the concept of moral obligation, as it was being used, was meaningless or lacked a proper foundation.\n\nSo, perhaps option D is the correct answer.\n\nBut I should double-check. Maybe there's another way to interpret her position.\n\nLet me consider that Anscombe was a proponent of virtue ethics, emphasizing the importance of character and virtues rather than duties or obligations.\n\nIn that case, she might have thought that the focus on moral obligation was misplaced, and that a better approach was to consider virtues and vices.\n\nBut that doesn't directly answer the question about what \"moral obligation\" signifies according to Anscombe.\n\nPerhaps the key is in her critique of the concept's foundation. She argued that without a divine lawgiver, the concept of moral obligation falls apart.\n\nSo, if there is no divine lawgiver, then moral obligation doesn't refer to anything real or objective.\n\nIn that sense, it would be like option D: no real concept at all.\n\nBut I need to make sure I'm not misinterpreting her.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Suppose I look at the options again:\n\nA. The norms of society.\n\nB. The feelings of an individual.\n\nC. The commands of God.\n\nD. No real concept at all.\n\nIf Anscombe thought that moral obligation requires a divine lawgiver to be meaningful, then in the absence of that, it wouldn't signify anything real.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to align with her critique.\n\nBut maybe she thought it signifies something else.\n\nWait, perhaps she thought it signifies the commands of God, but since God doesn't exist (or isn't being considered), it's empty.\n\nIn that case, option C might be a better fit, but with the caveat that she saw it as misplaced without the divine foundation.\n\nHowever, the way the question is phrased\u2014\u201cmoral obligation\u201d currently signifies\u2014it seems to be asking about what it means in contemporary usage, not necessarily what Anscombe thought it should mean.\n\nBut considering her critique, she might have thought that in current usage, it's being applied without a proper basis, making it effectively meaningless.\n\nSo, perhaps option D is the best answer based on her view.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she thought it signifies social norms, but as I recalled earlier, she was critical of that approach.\n\nI need to find a more definitive source to confirm.\n\nLooking back at \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" Anscombe discusses the concept of duty and obligation in the context of divine command theory.\n\nShe argues that without a divine lawgiver, the concept of moral obligation is not grounded and thus lacks meaning.\n\nTherefore, in her view, the concept of moral obligation, as used in modern philosophy, doesn't refer to anything real or objective.\n\nSo, option D: no real concept at all, seems to be the closest to her position.\n\nI think that's the answer she would agree with.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
