It says: \"What was the required labor service owed to the king in return for the privilege of using property owned by the Incan empire?\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Khipu\n\nB. Mit'a\n\nC. Split inheritance\n\nD. Capacocha\n\nHmm, I need to recall what each of these terms refers to in the context of the Incan civilization.\n\nStarting with option A: Khipu. I think a khipu is a system the Incas used to record information. It's like a rope with knots, and each knot represented different data, kind of like an early form of writing. But I don't think it's related to labor service. Maybe it's more about administration or record-keeping. So, probably not the answer.\n\nOption B: Mit'a. I've heard this term before. I think it refers to a system where people had to provide labor to the state or the empire. Like, in exchange for being able to use land or other properties owned by the Incan empire, they had to work a certain amount of time for the king or the state projects. Is that right? It sounds like it could be the answer.\n\nOption C: Split inheritance. This sounds more like a practice related to inheritance of property or assets among family members. Maybe it's about how property was divided when someone died. But the question is about labor service owed to the king for using empire property, so this probably isn't directly related.\n\nOption D: Capacocha. I'm not as familiar with this term. Let me think... I think it might be related to some kind of sacrifice or offering made to the gods in Incan culture. There was a practice where important people or even commoners would be offered to the gods, sometimes involving human sacrifice. But that seems quite different from a labor service owed to the king for using property.\n\nSo, based on what I recall, Mit'a seems to be the most fitting answer. It's about required labor service to the state in exchange for the use of property owned by the empire. The other options don't seem to directly relate to labor service owed to the king for property use.\n\nLet me just double-check. Khipu is about recording information, split inheritance is about dividing property among heirs, and capacocha is about sacrifices to the gods. None of these directly involve labor service to the king as a condition for using empire property.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B. Mit'a.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ Mit'a} \\]"
