                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I don't want to see my baby being teased, so I'll have him adopted.\" Okay, so someone is considering giving up their baby for adoption because they're worried about the child being teased. Now, adoption can be a complex decision, and there are lots of reasons why someone might choose to place their child for adoption. Concern for the child's well-being is one of them. Teasing can be hurtful, and maybe the parent feels like they can't provide the best environment or support to protect the child from that.\n\nBut is this morally wrong? Well, I think it depends on the circumstances. If the parent is genuinely acting in the best interests of the child and believes that adoption would provide a better life for the child, free from teasing and potential harm, then it might not be considered morally wrong. However, some people might argue that giving up a child for adoption is always wrong because it's abandoning the child. But I don't think that's the general view.\n\nIn the US, adoption is a recognized and legally sanctioned way of providing children with loving homes, especially if the biological parents feel they can't provide the care the child needs. So, if the parent is making this decision out of love and concern for the child's future, it's probably not considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I wanted to watch the predator of little kids.\" Wait, this seems a bit unclear. It says \"the predator of little kids,\" but I think there might be some missing words here. Maybe it's supposed to say something like \"I wanted to watch a movie about a predator of little kids\" or \"I wanted to watch a show where predators of little kids are caught.\" As it's written, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nAssuming it's about wanting to watch something that depicts or involves predators of little kids, that sounds pretty problematic. In the US, any content that involves the exploitation or harm of children is strictly illegal and morally reprehensible. So, if someone wants to watch something that involves child predators, that would be considered morally wrong.\n\nBut maybe the person meant something different. Perhaps they wanted to watch a documentary or a news segment about catching child predators, which could be seen as informative or supportive of law enforcement efforts. In that case, it might not be morally wrong, as the intent is to learn or to support positive actions.\n\nHowever, given the way it's phrased, \"I wanted to watch the predator of little kids,\" it seems like they want to watch something involving a predator, which could imply they have an interest in that subject matter, possibly in an inappropriate way.\n\nConsidering that, I think wanting to watch \"the predator of little kids\" is morally wrong, because it suggests an interest in harmful and illegal activities.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Considering adoption to prevent the child from being teased \u2013 probably not morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: Wanting to watch \"the predator of little kids\" \u2013 morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, but the options are presented as A. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, according to my analysis, C. Not wrong, Wrong is the right choice.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at this.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the parent is considering adoption to prevent teasing. Is there any way this could be considered morally wrong? Well, some might argue that giving up a child for adoption is wrong because it separates the child from their biological family, which can have emotional impacts. However, if the parent believes that adoption will provide a better life for the child, free from teasing and potential emotional distress, then it's a decision made out of concern for the child's well-being.\n\nMoreover, adoption is a recognized and accepted practice in the US, and it's often seen as a responsible way to ensure a child has a stable and loving home. So, I think it's not morally wrong in this context.\n\nIn Scenario 2, wanting to watch \"the predator of little kids\" seems highly suspect. It could imply an interest in pedophilia or other forms of child exploitation, which is both illegal and morally abhorrent. Even if the person meant watching something about catching predators, the way it's phrased suggests a different intent.\n\nTherefore, I stand by my initial conclusion that Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
