But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n\u2014Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nPresident Jackson's policy was later altered by the\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here, and it's about President Jackson's policy being altered by one of these options: the Homestead Act of 1862, the Immigration Act of 1921, the Supreme Court decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, or the Dawes Act of 1887. And there's a quote from Benjamin Franklin about taxation and representation, but that seems unrelated to Jackson's policies. Maybe it's just there to set some historical context or distract me.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what President Jackson's policies were focused on. I remember that Andrew Jackson was the seventh President of the United States, serving from 1829 to 1837. He was known for his populist views and was sometimes called \"Old Hickory.\" Some of his prominent policies included the Trail of Tears, where Native Americans were forcibly removed from their lands in the southeastern United States to make way for white settlers, and his opposition to the Second Bank of the United States.\n\nSo, his policies were largely about expanding white American settlement and asserting federal authority over the states in certain matters, like the Nullification Crisis.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Homestead Act of 1862: This was a law passed during the Civil War that allowed settlers to claim 160 acres of public land in exchange for improving it and living on it for five years. It was signed by President Abraham Lincoln, not Jackson. While it did encourage western expansion, which might indirectly relate to Jackson's policies of westward expansion, it seems too removed in time and not directly connected to Jackson's specific policies.\n\nB. Immigration Act of 1921: This act restricted immigration from Eastern and Southern Europe and was passed under President Warren G. Harding. It was a response to fears of overcrowding and concerns about the assimilation of new immigrants. Again, this is several decades after Jackson's presidency and doesn't seem directly related to his policies.\n\nC. Supreme Court decision in Plessy v. Ferguson: This was a landmark 1896 Supreme Court decision that upheld state laws requiring racial segregation under the \"separate but equal\" doctrine. It was decided during the presidency of Grover Cleveland and reinforced racial segregation in the South. While Jackson was known for his harsh treatment of Native Americans, this Supreme Court case came long after his time in office and dealt with African Americans, not directly altering Jackson's policies.\n\nD. Dawes Act of 1887: Also known as the General Allotment Act, this law was passed during the presidency of Grover Cleveland and aimed to assimilate Native Americans by dividing communal tribal land into individual plots and encouraging them to adopt European-American farming practices. It significantly impacted Native American land holdings and ways of life.\n\nGiven that Jackson was involved in policies related to Native Americans, particularly their removal from southeastern territories, the Dawes Act of 1887 seems like the most direct connection. The Dawes Act continued and built upon the policies started by Jackson, furthering the federal government's efforts to assimilate Native Americans and reduce their tribal lands.\n\nLet me think about this more deeply. Jackson's Indian Removal Act of 1830 authorized the president to negotiate treaties to exchange Native American lands in the southeastern U.S. for lands west of the Mississippi River. This led to the forced relocation of thousands of Native Americans, which is now known as the Trail of Tears.\n\nThe Dawes Act of 1887 came more than fifty years later and had a different approach. Instead of removing entire tribes to new lands, it aimed to break up tribal land holdings and allocate individual plots to Native Americans, with the goal of forcing them to adopt a more European-American style of agriculture and ultimately assimilate into white society.\n\nSo, while Jackson's policy was about relocating Native Americans to different territories, the Dawes Act was about changing their way of life and individualizing land ownership among them. It can be seen as a continuation and evolution of the policies started by Jackson.\n\nIn contrast, the other options don't align as closely with Jackson's policies:\n\n- The Homestead Act of 1862 was about settling the western frontier, but it was more about encouraging individual settlers to claim land, not specifically about Native American policies.\n\n- The Immigration Act of 1921 was about restricting immigration from certain regions, which isn't directly related to Jackson's domestic policies on land and Native Americans.\n\n- Plessy v. Ferguson dealt with racial segregation and the \"separate but equal\" doctrine, which was more about African Americans than about Native American policies.\n\nTherefore, the Dawes Act of 1887 is the option that most directly altered or built upon President Jackson's policies regarding Native Americans and land use.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
