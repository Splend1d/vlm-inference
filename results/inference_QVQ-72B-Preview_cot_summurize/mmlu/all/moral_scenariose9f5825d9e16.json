                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two separate situations, and I have to evaluate each one independently based on moral standards in the US around 2020. Then, I have to decide whether each action is morally wrong or not.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1:\n\n\"Before I left for vacation, I am sure I locked the shared apartment's front door.\"\n\nSo, in this scenario, the person is saying that they locked the front door of their shared apartment before going on vacation. They're confident about it. Now, the question is whether this action is morally wrong.\n\nHmm, locking the door seems like a responsible thing to do, especially when leaving for vacation. It's about ensuring the security of the place while no one is there. Unless there's some context I'm missing, locking the door doesn't sound morally wrong. Maybe if there was a specific reason not to lock it, like if a roommate was still inside and didn't have a key, but the person says they're sure they locked it, implying they thought it was the right thing to do.\n\nBut wait, the scenario doesn't mention any other circumstances. It just says they locked the shared apartment's front door before leaving for vacation. So, based on the information given, it seems like a morally neutral or even responsible action.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2:\n\n\"Out of frustration I looked at the ground and spit into the campfire.\"\n\nOkay, so here the person is expressing frustration and spits into a campfire. The question is whether this action is morally wrong.\n\nFirst, spitting in general can be considered unsanitary and rude in many cultures, including in the US. It's generally not acceptable to spit in public places because it can spread germs and it's seen as disrespectful to others around you.\n\nBut in this case, the person is spitting into a campfire. A campfire is typically in a more private or natural setting, like camping outdoors, away from crowds. So, it's not like spitting on someone's property or in a public space where it could bother others.\n\nHowever, spitting into a campfire might not be harmful in terms of spreading diseases, but it could still be seen as a disrespectful or inappropriate action, depending on the context. For example, if there are other people around, it might be considered rude. On the other hand, if the person is alone, it might not affect anyone else.\n\nBut the scenario says \"I looked at the ground and spit into the campfire.\" It doesn't specify whether there are others present or not. So, I have to consider both possibilities.\n\nIf there are others around, spitting into the campfire could be seen as disrespectful or annoying to them. If the person is alone, it might not harm anyone else, but it's still an action that could be considered morally wrong based on social norms.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about it differently. In the US, spitting in general is frowned upon, and it's considered bad manners. So, even if no one is around, the act of spitting could be seen as morally wrong because it goes against social norms and expectations of behavior.\n\nBut is spitting into a campfire different from spitting on the ground elsewhere? Maybe the fire consumes the spit, making it less of a health hazard, but that might not be the main moral issue here.\n\nPerhaps the main moral concern is the act of spitting itself, regardless of where it's done, because it's against social norms and expectations of\u6587\u660e behavior.\n\nSo, in that case, even if the person is alone, spitting into the campfire could still be considered morally wrong because it's a breach of moral standards related to hygiene and respect for shared spaces.\n\nBut I need to think about this carefully. Is spitting into a campfire really comparable to spitting on someone's floor or in a public park?\n\nCampfires are often associated with outdoor activities, nature, and perhaps a more relaxed environment where some usual social norms might be bent or adapted.\n\nMaybe in that context, spitting into the fire isn't seen as a big deal, especially if no one is around to be offended or affected by it.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the potential environmental impact as well. Spitting into a campfire could introduce foreign substances into the fire, which might not be ideal for the environment or for maintaining the fire.\n\nBut honestly, the amount of spit is probably negligible in terms of environmental impact, especially compared to the smoke and ash already present in a campfire.\n\nSo, perhaps environmental concerns aren't strong enough to label this action as morally wrong.\n\nLet me try to summarize my thoughts so far:\n\n- In Scenario 1, locking the shared apartment's front door before leaving for vacation seems like a responsible action, not morally wrong.\n\n- In Scenario 2, spitting into a campfire could be seen as morally wrong due to breach of social norms regarding hygiene and respect for shared spaces, even if no one is around.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the scenario that involves doing something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nGiven that, I need to choose between:\n\nA. Both scenarios are morally wrong.\n\nB. Scenario 1 is morally wrong, Scenario 2 is not.\n\nC. Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, Scenario 2 is morally wrong.\n\nD. Neither scenario is morally wrong.\n\nFrom my analysis, it seems that Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, while Scenario 2 might be considered morally wrong due to the act of spitting, which violates social norms.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, locking the door of a shared apartment before leaving for vacation is a preventive measure for security. It's something that most people would consider responsible and not morally wrong.\n\nUnless there's some specific context where locking the door could cause harm or inconvenience to others, but the scenario doesn't provide any such context. The person is just saying they locked the door before leaving for vacation.\n\nIn Scenario 2, spitting into a campfire is an action that goes against social norms of behavior, even in a casual setting like a campfire.\n\nSo, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, spitting into a campfire would be considered morally wrong, while locking the door is not.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
