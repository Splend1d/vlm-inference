                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem: There are 25 people going fishing, and they're all going in boats. Each boat can hold 5 people. I need to find out how many boats they used. Okay, so basically, it's like dividing the total number of people by the number of people per boat, right?\n\nSo, total people are 25, and each boat holds 5 people. To find the number of boats, I should divide 25 by 5. Let me just double-check that.\n\nIf I have 25 people and each boat takes 5, then 25 divided by 5 is 5 boats. That seems straightforward. But let me think if there's another way to look at it, just to be sure.\n\nMaybe I could think about multiples. Like, 5 times what number gives me 25. 5 times 5 is 25. So, again, that points to 5 boats.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can use addition to figure this out. Starting with 0 boats and adding people until I reach 25. So, one boat adds 5 people, two boats add 10, and so on, until I reach five boats, which add 25 people. Yeah, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider using multiplication. If I have a certain number of boats and multiply by 5 (people per boat), I should get 25. So, boats times 5 equals 25. To find boats, I'd still need to divide both sides by 5. So, again, that leads me back to division.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other operation that could be applicable here. Subtraction doesn't seem to fit because subtracting 5 from 25 would give me 20, which doesn't directly relate to the number of boats. Adding 5 to 25 would give me 30, which is more than the total number of people, so that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nMultiplying 25 by 5 would give me 125, which is way more than the total number of people, so that can't be right. Unless there's some other context, but based on the problem, it seems like division is the way to go.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use fractions. If each boat represents a group of 5 people, then the total number of boats is the total people divided by the people per boat. So, again, 25 divided by 5 equals 5 boats.\n\nI think I'm confident with this approach. Let me just make sure there aren't any tricks here. The problem says \"all 25 people went fishing in boats,\" and each boat had 5 people. So, no partial boats or anything like that. It's a straightforward division problem.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider an example with smaller numbers. Suppose there are 10 people and each boat holds 2 people. How many boats are needed? Well, 10 divided by 2 is 5 boats. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nOr, if there are 12 people and each boat holds 4, then 12 divided by 4 is 3 boats. Again, division works perfectly.\n\nSo, applying the same logic to the original problem, 25 divided by 5 equals 5 boats.\n\nTherefore, the correct operation to find the number of boats is to divide 25 by 5.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Add 5 to 25\n\nB. Divide 25 by 5\n\nC. Multiply 25 by 5\n\nD. Subtract 5 from 25\n\nThe correct choice is B. Divide 25 by 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
