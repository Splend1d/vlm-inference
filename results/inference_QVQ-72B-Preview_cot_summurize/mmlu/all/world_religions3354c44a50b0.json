                    "text": "So I have this question about the Continental Reformation. It asks when it started, and gives me four options: 1545, 1517, 1492, or 1705. Hmm, I need to remember which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Reformation was a big deal in European history. It was a movement that split Christianity in Western Europe, leading to the rise of Protestantism. But when did it actually start?\n\nLet me think about this. I recall that Martin Luther was a key figure in the Reformation. He was a German monk who had some issues with the Catholic Church's practices at the time. One of the things he disagreed with was the sale of indulgences, which basically allowed people to pay money to the Church to reduce their punishment for sins.\n\nSo, Luther wrote something important, right? Yeah, he wrote the Ninety-Five Theses, which was a list of arguments against these practices. And I think that's when the Reformation really began to pick up steam.\n\nNow, when did he write that? I remember it was in 1517. In fact, it was on October 31, 1517, that he supposedly nailed his Ninety-Five Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg. That date is often cited as the starting point of the Reformation.\n\nLet me double-check that. If the Reformation started in 1517 with Luther's Ninety-Five Theses, then option B. 1517 should be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options. 1492 is the year Columbus discovered America, which is unrelated to the Reformation. 1545 is after the Reformation had already begun; in fact, that's when the Council of Trent started, which was the Catholic Church's response to the Reformation. And 1705 is way later; that's already the early Enlightenment period.\n\nSo, based on this, 1517 seems to be the correct year for the start of the Continental Reformation.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure that the term \"Continental Reformation\" doesn't refer to something else. The question specifies \"Continental Reformation,\" so maybe there's a specific context here.\n\nLet me see. The Reformation did spread across continental Europe, leading to various Protestant denominations emerging, like Calvinism in Switzerland and France, and the Anglican Church in England. But the starting point is still generally considered to be Luther's actions in Germany in 1517.\n\nPerhaps the term \"Continental Reformation\" is used to distinguish it from the Reformation in Britain, but even then, the starting point remains the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it refers to the spread of Reformation ideas to other continents, but that seems unlikely in the context of the question.\n\nNo, I think it's safe to assume that the Continental Reformation refers to the Reformation that took place in continental Europe, starting with Luther's Ninety-Five Theses in 1517.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. 1517.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I'll recap:\n\n- 1492: Columbus reaches the New World\n\n- 1517: Luther's Ninety-Five Theses, starting the Reformation\n\n- 1545: Council of Trent begins, the Catholic Church's counter-reformation\n\n- 1705: Not related to the Reformation's start\n\nSo, yeah, B. 1517 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 1517} \\]"
