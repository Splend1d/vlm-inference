                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it.\n\nFirst off, there's a police officer who hears breaking glass and an alarm, and sees Stan running out of a darkened liquor store in the middle of the night, like 3 a.m. Stan runs around a corner, gets out of the officer's sight, and jumps into a car. The officer follows, sees Stan driving away, and pursues with flashing lights. Stan pulls over, and the officer arrests him.\n\nNow, during the arrest, the officer looks in the passenger compartment and doesn't see anything suspicious. But then the officer pops the trunk and finds cash and a baseball bat. Stan is trying to suppress this evidence, meaning he wants to prevent it from being used against him in court, probably arguing that the search was illegal.\n\nSo, the question is, will his motion to suppress likely be denied or granted? And the options are:\n\nA. Denied, because the officer had probable cause to search the trunk.\n\nB. Denied, because a search incident to a valid arrest in an automobile always includes the trunk.\n\nC. Granted, because the trunk area was out of the range of Stan's control.\n\nD. Granted, because the arrest was illegal and therefore the evidence is considered to be fruit of the poisonous tree.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probable cause means. Probable cause is when a police officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a person has committed a crime or is about to commit a crime. In this case, the officer heard breaking glass and an alarm, saw Stan running out of a closed liquor store in the early hours, and then saw him flee in a car. That seems pretty suspicious, and I think that would give the officer probable cause to believe that Stan was involved in some criminal activity, like burglary or vandalism.\n\nNow, the officer arrests Stan, and during the arrest, searches the car. The officer finds cash and a baseball bat in the trunk. Stan is trying to suppress this evidence, probably arguing that the search of the trunk was unconstitutional.\n\nI need to recall the rules about searching vehicles incident to an arrest. I remember that there's a Supreme Court case called New York v. Belton (1981) that established that when a person is arrested in a vehicle, the police can search the entire vehicle without a warrant as part of the arrest. This is based on the idea that the vehicle could contain evidence related to the crime or items that could be used to harm the officer.\n\nBut I've also heard of a more recent case, Arizona v. Gant (2009), which clarified and limited the scope of vehicle searches incident to arrest. In Gant, the Supreme Court said that such searches are permissible only if:\n\n1. The arrestee is within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search, or\n\n2. The police have reasonable belief that evidence relevant to the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the officer arrests Stan, and searches the trunk, finding cash and a baseball bat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the trunk is considered part of the passenger compartment under Belton and Gant.\n\nI think that generally, the trunk is not considered part of the passenger compartment. Belton defined the passenger compartment as the area within the reach of the arrestee, which is typically the area inside the car where passengers sit, not the trunk.\n\nSo, if the trunk is not part of the passenger compartment, then searching it incident to the arrest might not be automatically permissible under Gant.\n\nBut, in this case, the officer had probable cause to believe that Stan was involved in criminal activity, given the circumstances of breaking glass, an alarm, and fleeing in a car in the middle of the night.\n\nMaybe the officer had probable cause to search the entire car, including the trunk, based on the circumstances.\n\nOption A says that the motion to suppress will be denied because the officer had probable cause to search the trunk.\n\nThat makes sense because, with probable cause, the officer can get a search warrant, but in this case, since it's a vehicle, which is mobile, there might be an exception to the warrant requirement.\n\nI recall that there's a vehicle exception to the warrant requirement, which allows police to search a vehicle without a warrant if they have probable cause to believe that it contains evidence of a crime.\n\nSo, if the officer has probable cause to believe that the trunk contains evidence of a crime, like stolen items or tools used in the crime, then searching the trunk without a warrant might be permissible under the vehicle exception.\n\nIn this scenario, the officer heard breaking glass and an alarm, saw Stan running out of a darkened liquor store at 3 a.m., and saw him flee in a car. These facts would likely give the officer probable cause to believe that a burglary had occurred or was occurring, and that the car might contain evidence related to that crime, such as stolen items or tools used in the burglary.\n\nTherefore, the search of the trunk might be justified under the vehicle exception, making the evidence admissible.\n\nSo, option A suggests that the motion to suppress will be denied because of probable cause.\n\nOption B says that the motion will be denied because a search incident to a valid arrest in an automobile always includes the trunk.\n\nBut wait, as I recalled earlier, Gant limited the scope of searches incident to arrest in vehicles. It doesn't always include the trunk. So, this seems too broad and not accurate based on current case law.\n\nTherefore, option B is probably incorrect.\n\nOption C says that the motion will be granted because the trunk area was out of the range of Stan's control.\n\nThis seems to be referring to the concept of \"within reaching distance\" from the passenger compartment, which is a key point in Gant.\n\nIf the trunk is not within the arrestee's reaching distance, then searching it incident to the arrest isn't automatically permissible.\n\nIn this scenario, if Stan was arrested while in the passenger compartment, and the trunk is separate, then the trunk isn't within his reaching distance, and so the search might not be justified under the search incident to arrest doctrine.\n\nHowever, as I thought earlier, the officer might have had probable cause to search the trunk under the vehicle exception.\n\nSo, even if the trunk isn't within reaching distance, if there's probable cause to believe it contains evidence of a crime, the search might still be valid.\n\nOption D says that the motion will be granted because the arrest was illegal, and therefore the evidence is considered fruit of the poisonous tree.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the arrest was legal.\n\nThe officer had probable cause to believe that Stan was involved in criminal activity based on the circumstances: breaking glass, alarm, fleeing in a car from a darkened liquor store at 3 a.m.\n\nSo, the arrest seems to be based on probable cause, and therefore likely legal.\n\nIf the arrest is legal, then the evidence obtained as a result shouldn't be suppressed under the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.\n\nBut in this case, since the arrest seems to be based on probable cause, the tree itself isn't poisonous, so to speak.\n\nTherefore, option D seems incorrect.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that option A is the most accurate.\n\nThe motion to suppress will likely be denied because the officer had probable cause to search the trunk under the vehicle exception.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
