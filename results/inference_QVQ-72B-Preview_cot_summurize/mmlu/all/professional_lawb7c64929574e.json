                    "text": "So I've got this question about the constitutionality of a federal statute that makes Pennsylvania Avenue a one-way street in Washington, D.C. The statute was passed by Congress with the aim of making it easier for members of Congress to commute to the Capitol without getting stuck in heavy traffic. But before this, the Washington, D.C. City Council had already designated Pennsylvania Avenue as a two-lane street. Now, I need to figure out which statement accurately describes the constitutionality of this federal statute.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what powers Congress has over Washington, D.C. I know that Washington, D.C. is the federal district, and according to the Constitution, Congress has the power to exercise exclusive legislation over the District. That's in Article I, Section 8, Clause 17, I think. So, Congress has broad powers over D.C., but are there any limits to that power?\n\nOption A says it's valid because Congress has exclusive power over the District of Columbia. That seems straightforward, but maybe there's more to it.\n\nOption B mentions that it's a proper exercise of Congress's enumerated property power. Hmm, I need to think about what enumerated powers relate to property. The Property Clause allows Congress to \"exercise exclusive Legislation...in all Cases whatsoever\" over the District. So, perhaps this falls under that.\n\nOption C claims it's invalid because the Washington, D.C. City Council has exclusive power over public thoroughfares within D.C. But wait, Congress has the ultimate authority over D.C., right? So, unless there's some specific limitation, Congress should be able to pass such a law.\n\nOption D says it's invalid because it's a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce. Interstate commerce is regulated by Congress under the Commerce Clause. But in this case, the statute is about traffic flow on a local street in D.C., not directly regulating commerce between states. So, maybe it's not directly related to interstate commerce.\n\nLet me consider the relationship between federal and local authority in D.C. Congress has the power to legislate for D.C., but D.C. also has its own local government with some autonomy. However, Congress can override local laws if it chooses to exercise its authority.\n\nIn this scenario, the City Council had passed an ordinance making Pennsylvania Avenue a two-lane street, and now Congress is passing a statute to make it a one-way street. So, there's a conflict between local and federal legislation.\n\nGiven that Congress has the ultimate authority over D.C., I would think that its statute would supersede the local ordinance. So, the fact that the City Council passed a different ordinance shouldn't necessarily make the federal statute invalid.\n\nBut maybe there are other considerations, like the purpose of the statute. The statute is intended to make it easier for members of Congress to commute without traffic delays. Is that a legitimate purpose for Congress to pursue?\n\nWell, ensuring that members of Congress can efficiently travel to the Capitol might seem like a legitimate concern, especially since Congress is responsible for making laws and conducting legislative business. However, prioritizing the commuting convenience of Congress members over other users of the street might raise equity issues, but that doesn't necessarily make it unconstitutional.\n\nNow, considering the options again:\n\nA. It's valid because Congress has exclusive power over the District of Columbia.\n\nThis seems correct, as Congress has the authority to legislate for D.C.\n\nB. It's valid because it's a proper exercise of Congress's enumerated property power.\n\nThe Property Clause does give Congress the power to legislate for D.C., but I'm not sure if designating a street as one-way is directly related to property rights. It seems more related to traffic regulation.\n\nC. It's invalid because the Washington, D.C. City Council has exclusive power over public thoroughfares within the District of Columbia.\n\nThis contradicts the idea that Congress has exclusive legislative authority over D.C. While the City Council has some autonomy, Congress can override its decisions.\n\nD. It's invalid because it's a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce.\n\nI don't see a direct connection here. Pennsylvania Avenue is primarily a local street in D.C., and while it might have some interstate significance, I don't think this statute would substantially burden interstate commerce in a way that would make it unconstitutional.\n\nGiven this analysis, option A seems the most accurate statement. Congress has the power to legislate over D.C., and therefore, the statute is valid.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a principle that Congress can't arbitrarily regulate local matters in D.C. No, I don't think so. The whole point of Congress having exclusive legislation over D.C. is to manage local affairs as well as federal ones.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps there's a preemption issue here, but it's more about the relationship between federal and local authority in D.C., not between state and federal law.\n\nI think the answer is A. It is valid because Congress has exclusive power over the District of Columbia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
