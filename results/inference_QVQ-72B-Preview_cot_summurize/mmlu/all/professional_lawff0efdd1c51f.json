                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a land sale, and there seems to be some confusion over the price offered. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nA landowner received a letter from a buyer who said, \"I will pay you $2,200 an acre for [the parcel].\" The owner replied, \"I accept your offer.\" But here's the twist: the buyer meant to offer $2,000 per acre but mistakenly typed $2,200. Both sides knew that similar land in the area was selling for between $2,000 and $2,400 per acre.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of the provided options correctly states the probable legal consequences of this correspondence. There are four options:\n\nA. There is no contract because the parties attached materially different meanings to the price term.\n\nB. There is no enforceable contract because the buyer is entitled to rescission due to a mutual mistake as to a basic assumption.\n\nC. There is a contract formed at a price of $2,000 per acre, as the buyer intended.\n\nD. There is a contract formed at a price of $2,200 per acre, regardless of the buyer's true intention.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some contract law basics. A contract generally requires an offer and an acceptance of that offer. In this case, the buyer made an offer to pay $2,200 per acre, and the seller accepted that offer. So, on the surface, it looks like there's a contract at $2,200 per acre.\n\nBut there's this mistake by the buyer. They intended to offer $2,000 per acre but wrote $2,200 by mistake. So, there's a discrepancy between what they meant to offer and what was actually offered.\n\nNow, the question is whether this mistake affects the validity of the contract or the terms of the contract.\n\nOption A says there's no contract because the parties had different understandings of the price term. But wait, the seller accepted the offer as it was written, which was $2,200 per acre. So, unless there's some reason to think that the seller didn't understand it was a mistake, or that there was some ambiguity in the offer, I'm not sure if this applies.\n\nOption B mentions rescission due to a mutual mistake about a basic assumption. Rescission means canceling the contract. But was there a mutual mistake? The buyer made a mistake, but the seller accepted the offer as is, without knowing about the mistake. So, it's not really a mutual mistake; it's unilateral mistake by the buyer.\n\nIn contract law, a unilateral mistake can sometimes allow the mistaken party to avoid the contract if the mistake was material and the other party was aware of the mistake or it would be unconscionable to enforce the contract. But in this case, the seller accepted the offer without knowing about the mistake, and the price was within the range of comparable sales ($2,000 to $2,400 per acre). So, it doesn't seem like the mistake was about a basic assumption that would justify rescission.\n\nOption C says there's a contract at $2,000 per acre, which was the buyer's intended price. But that doesn't seem right because the offer was for $2,200, and the acceptance was based on that. Unless there's some principle that allows reformation of the contract to reflect the true intention, which might be possible in some jurisdictions if there was a mutual understanding or if the mistake was mutual, but again, this seems to be a unilateral mistake by the buyer.\n\nOption D states there's a contract at $2,200 per acre, regardless of the buyer's true intention. This seems straightforward and in line with basic contract principles. The offer was clear, and it was accepted, so the contract should be formed at the terms of the offer.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Perhaps the buyer can argue that there was a mistake in the offer and try to correct it or have the contract reformed to reflect the true intention.\n\nLet me think about this again.\n\nThe buyer intended to offer $2,000 per acre but mistakenly wrote $2,200. The seller accepted the offer at $2,200 without knowing about the mistake.\n\nIn contract law, generally, an offer is interpreted based on what was communicated, not what was intended. So, if the offer says $2,200, and the acceptance is based on that, then the contract should be at $2,200 per acre.\n\nHowever, there might be exceptions or doctrines that allow for correction if there was a clear mistake in the offer and the acceptance was based on a misunderstanding.\n\nBut in this scenario, the seller accepted the offer as it was written, and both parties knew that comparable land was selling for between $2,000 and $2,400 per acre. So, the price of $2,200 wasn't outside the range of what was considered acceptable in the market.\n\nGiven that, it doesn't seem like there was a mutual misunderstanding or a mistake that would allow the buyer to back out or have the contract reformed.\n\nTherefore, the most probable legal consequence is that there is a contract formed at a price of $2,200 per acre, as per the terms of the offer that was accepted.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Is there any possibility that the contract could be formed at $2,000 per acre, as the buyer intended?\n\nWell, no, because the offer was for $2,200, and the acceptance was for that price. The buyer's intention doesn't override the clear terms of the offer.\n\nUnless there's some evidence that both parties understood the price to be $2,000 per acre, which isn't indicated here, there's no basis to form a contract at $2,000.\n\nSimilarly, there doesn't seem to be a ground for rescinding the contract based on mutual mistake, since it was only the buyer who made the mistake.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct choice: there is a contract formed at a price of $2,200 per acre, regardless of the buyer's true intention.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
