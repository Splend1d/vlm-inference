Let me think about each option one by one.\n\nFirst, social stratification. I remember learning about this in my sociology class. Social stratification refers to the way societies rank people in a hierarchy based on factors like wealth, power, and prestige. So, it's about layers or levels in society. But does it also cover people's movement between these layers? Maybe, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nNext, social control. I think this has to do with how society regulates people's behavior. Like, there are norms and rules that people are expected to follow, and there are mechanisms to enforce them, such as laws or social pressure. But this doesn't seem directly related to layers in society or moving between them.\n\nThen there's social conflict. This seems to be about disagreements and tensions between different groups in society, often over resources or power. It's a bit related to stratification because conflicts can arise from inequalities, but again, it doesn't directly address the structure of layers or people moving between them.\n\nLastly, social solidarity. This sounds like it's about unity and cooperation among members of a society. It's about how people come together and support each other, maybe through shared values or mutual aid. Again, not directly about layers or mobility.\n\nLet me go back to social stratification. I think it does include the idea of social mobility, which is about moving between different social layers or classes. There's upward mobility, where people move to higher levels, and downward mobility, where they move to lower levels. This seems to fit the description in the question.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check my notes. Oh, here it is: \"Social stratification involves not only the ranking of people into layers but also the possibility of social mobility, which is the movement of individuals or groups from one social position to another.\"\n\nThat sounds exactly like what the question is describing. So, social stratification includes both the structure of layers and the movement between them.\n\nI think the answer is A. social stratification.\n\nWait a minute, maybe social mobility is part of social stratification. Let me confirm this. Yes, in sociology, social stratification systems include concepts like class, caste, and slavery, and within these systems, there can be varying degrees of mobility.\n\nSo, the study of these layers and the movement between them is indeed social stratification.\n\nI don't think it's social control, because that's more about regulating behavior, not about layers or mobility.\n\nSocial conflict is about tensions and disagreements, which might be related to stratification but aren't specifically about the structure or mobility.\n\nAnd social solidarity is about unity, which is different from the structure of layers and movement between them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. social stratification.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
