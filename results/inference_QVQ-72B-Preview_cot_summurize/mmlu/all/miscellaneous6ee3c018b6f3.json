                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"What rank entitles a general in the US Army to wear three stars?\" And the options are A. brigadier general, B. corporal general, C. lieutenant general, D. major general. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these ranks corresponds to three stars in the US Army.\n\nFirst off, I know that in the US Army, generals are high-ranking officers, and they have different levels indicated by the number of stars they wear. For example, a brigadier general is a one-star general, a major general is a two-star, and so on. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact progression.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. I recall that the ranks in the US Army, starting from the top, go something like this: general of the army (five stars), general (four stars), lieutenant general (three stars), major general (two stars), and brigadier general (one star). Wait, but I think there might be some confusion because I've also heard of a vice chief of staff or something like that.\n\nLet me double-check this. I remember that the chief of staff of the Army is a four-star general, and below that is the vice chief, who might also be a four-star, but I'm not sure. Anyway, for the purposes of this question, I need to focus on the general officer ranks and their corresponding stars.\n\nSo, brigadier general is definitely a one-star general. Major general is a two-star. Lieutenant general should be a three-star rank, and general is a four-star. That seems logical. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nI think the confusion might come from the fact that in some contexts, the term \"lieutenant general\" can refer to different things in different countries, but in the US Army, it's specifically a three-star rank.\n\nAlso, option B is \"corporal general,\" which sounds a bit odd to me. I don't recall any rank called \"corporal general\" in the US Army. Corporal is typically an enlisted rank, not an officer rank. So, maybe that's a mistake or a typo.\n\nWait, maybe it's \"colonel general.\" No, that doesn't sound right either. In the US Army, the ranks go from brigadier general, major general, lieutenant general, general, and then up to general of the army. So, \"corporal general\" seems out of place.\n\nPerhaps the correct options are A. brigadier general, C. lieutenant general, and D. major general, with B being an incorrect distractor. But I should ignore that and focus on the correct ranks.\n\nSo, to reiterate, brigadier general is one star, major general is two stars, lieutenant general is three stars, and general is four stars. Therefore, the rank that entitles a general to wear three stars should be lieutenant general.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there are any other ranks that might also wear three stars. In the US Army, I don't think there are any other general officer ranks besides those four. So, lieutenant general is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, I've heard of \"vice admiral\" in the Navy, which is a three-star rank, but in the Army, it's lieutenant general. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlso, I recall that in some armies, like the British Army, they have lieutenant generals who are equivalent to major generals in the US Army, but again, in the US Army, lieutenant general is a three-star rank.\n\nSo, I think I've got it straight now. The answer should be C. lieutenant general.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. lieutenant general}} \\]"
