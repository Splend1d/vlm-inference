                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which statement is incorrect about the Box-Pierce Q and the Ljung-Box Q* statistics used to test for linear dependence in time series data. I'm not entirely familiar with these tests, but I'll try to understand each option.\n\nFirst, I need to know what the Box-Pierce Q and the Ljung-Box Q* statistics are. From what I can recall, these are both tests for autocorrelation in residuals of a time series model. The Box-Pierce Q statistic is a test for up to a certain number of lags, say k, to see if there's any autocorrelation in those lags. The Ljung-Box Q* is an improved version of the Box-Pierce Q, designed to have better properties, especially in small samples.\n\nOption A says that asymptotically, the values of the two test statistics will be equal. Asymptotically means as the sample size becomes very large. So, in large samples, both statistics should converge to the same value. That makes sense because both are testing the same hypothesis, just with different approaches. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption B says that the Q test has better small-sample properties than the Q*. Wait, the Q test is the original Box-Pierce, and Q* is the Ljung-Box version. I thought that the Ljung-Box Q* was designed to have better small-sample properties than the Box-Pierce Q. So, this statement seems contrary to what I think. Maybe this is the incorrect statement.\n\nOption C says that the Q test is sometimes over-sized for small samples. Oversized means that the test rejects the null hypothesis more often than it should, based on the specified significance level. This could be a property of the Box-Pierce Q in small samples, which might make it too liberal in rejecting the null. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption D says that as the sample size tends towards infinity, both tests will show a tendency to always reject the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation coefficients. Well, asymptotically, if there's any autocorrelation, no matter how small, the tests should detect it with high power. So, in the presence of even slight autocorrelation, the tests should reject the null as sample size increases. However, if there's truly no autocorrelation, they shouldn't reject. But the statement seems to suggest that they will always reject, which might not be accurate if the null is true.\n\nWait, the statement says \"always reject,\" which implies that regardless of whether there's autocorrelation, as sample size increases, they will always reject. That doesn't sound right. Tests are supposed to converge to the correct decision as sample size increases.\n\nLet me think again. If there's no autocorrelation, the tests should not reject the null hypothesis as sample size increases. If there is autocorrelation, they should reject more and more often as sample size increases. So, the way option D is phrased\u2014\u201ctendency to always reject the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation coefficients\u201d\u2014could be misleading. It's not always, but in the presence of autocorrelation.\n\nSo, perhaps option D is incorrectly stated because it says \"always reject,\" which might imply incorrectly that the tests will reject even when there's no autocorrelation, which shouldn't be the case asymptotically.\n\nBut I need to be careful. Maybe I should look up the properties of these tests to confirm.\n\nAlright, after a quick search, I find that the Box-Pierce Q and Ljung-Box Q* are both used to test for autocorrelation in time series data. The Ljung-Box Q* was indeed designed to improve upon the Box-Pierce Q, especially in small samples.\n\nOption A: Asymptotically, the values of the two test statistics will be equal. This seems correct because both tests are based on the same principle and should converge to the same distribution as sample size increases.\n\nOption B: The Q test has better small-sample properties than the Q*. Given that Q* was designed to improve small-sample properties, this statement seems incorrect. It should be the other way around; Q* should have better small-sample properties.\n\nOption C: The Q test is sometimes over-sized for small samples. This is likely correct because the original Box-Pierce Q may be too liberal in small samples, leading to more rejections than desired.\n\nOption D: As the sample size tends towards infinity, both tests will show a tendency to always reject the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation coefficients. This seems misleading. If there's no autocorrelation, the tests should not reject the null hypothesis asymptotically. If there is autocorrelation, they should detect it with high power as sample size increases. So, the way it's phrased suggests they will always reject, which isn't accurate.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect statements are likely option B and option D. But since the question asks for the single incorrect statement, I need to choose one.\n\nBetween B and D, B seems more clearly incorrect because it contradicts the purpose of the Ljung-Box Q* statistic, which was to improve small-sample properties compared to the Box-Pierce Q.\n\nOption D, while poorly phrased, might still be somewhat accurate in the sense that in the presence of autocorrelation, the tests will tend to reject as sample size increases. However, it's phrased as \"always reject,\" which is too strong.\n\nGiven that, I think option B is the most incorrect statement because it directly contradicts the known properties of the Ljung-Box Q* statistic being better suited for small samples compared to the Box-Pierce Q.\n\nSo, my answer is B. The Q test has better small-sample properties than the Q*.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
