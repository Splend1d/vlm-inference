The options are:\n\nA. Conversion of the preferred stock into common stock.\n\nB. Voting rights.\n\nC. Dividend carryovers from years in which dividends were not paid.\n\nD. Guaranteed dividends.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what cumulative preferred stock is. Preferred stock generally has priority over common stock in terms of dividends and asset distribution if the company were to liquidate. The \"cumulative\" part means that if dividends are not paid in one year, they accumulate and must be paid before common stockholders can receive any dividends.\n\nSo, cumulative preferred stockholders have the right to have any unpaid dividends accumulate and be paid in future years before common stockholders get anything.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Conversion of the preferred stock into common stock.\n\nNot all preferred stocks are convertible. Some preferred stocks do have a conversion feature, which allows the holder to exchange preferred shares for a certain number of common shares. However, this is not a standard feature of all cumulative preferred stocks. It's an additional feature that has to be specified in the stock's terms.\n\nSo, I don't think this is always guaranteed.\n\nB. Voting rights.\n\nGenerally, preferred stockholders have limited voting rights compared to common stockholders. In many cases, they may only vote on specific matters related to their preferred stock, like changes in dividend rates or certain corporate actions that affect preferred stock. But full voting rights like common stockholders typically have are not guaranteed.\n\nSo, again, not always entitled to full voting rights.\n\nC. Dividend carryovers from years in which dividends were not paid.\n\nThis seems directly related to the definition of cumulative preferred stock. As I understood earlier, cumulative preferred stock means that if dividends are skipped in a year, those dividends accumulate and must be paid in the future before common stockholders can receive any dividends.\n\nSo, this seems like a core feature of cumulative preferred stock.\n\nD. Guaranteed dividends.\n\nWait a minute, dividends are not guaranteed in the sense that the company must pay them every year. Even with cumulative preferred stock, the company can choose not to pay dividends in a given year, and the unpaid dividends accumulate. But there's no guarantee that dividends will be paid at all if the company doesn't have the funds or chooses not to pay them.\n\nSo, \"guaranteed dividends\" isn't accurate because there's no legal obligation to pay dividends if the company can't or doesn't want to.\n\nTherefore, the right that the holder of cumulative preferred stock is always entitled to is the dividend carryovers from years in which dividends were not paid. This is because the \"cumulative\" feature specifically refers to the accumulation of unpaid dividends to be paid later.\n\nSo, the answer should be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
