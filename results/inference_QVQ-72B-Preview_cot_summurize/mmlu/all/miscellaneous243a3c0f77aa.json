Edmund Earl\n\nC. Ernest Eakins\n\nD. Eugene Evan\n\nHmm, I'm not entirely sure off the top of my head, but I think I've heard of his full name before. Let me see.\n\nI know that E E Cummings was an American poet, painter, and playwright. He was born in the early 20th century, I believe around 1894, and he was known for his unique style of writing, particularly his experimental use of syntax and typography.\n\nLet me recall his full name. I think his first name was Edward, and his middle name was Estlin. So that would make his full name Edward Estlin Cummings. That seems familiar.\n\nLet me double-check this. I remember that he was often referred to as e. e. cummings, with lowercase letters, which was his preference. But what were his actual given names?\n\nI think his given names were Edward Estlin, so \"E E\" would stand for Edward Estlin. That would make option A correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption B is Edmund Earl. I don't think that's correct. I don't recall \"Earl\" being part of his name.\n\nOption C is Ernest Eakins. That doesn't sound right either. I've never heard of \"Eakins\" in relation to E E Cummings.\n\nOption D is Eugene Evan. Again, that doesn't ring a bell. I don't think that's his name.\n\nSo, based on what I know, option A, Edward Estlin, seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, I should make sure about this. Maybe I should think about some biographical details to confirm.\n\nEdward Estlin Cummings was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1894. His father was a minister and professor at Harvard Divinity School, and his mother was involved in social causes. Given that background, it's plausible that he was given a formal name like Edward Estlin.\n\nAnother thing I recall is that Cummings himself preferred to have his name written in lowercase letters, without periods, as \"e. e. cummings.\" However, his name was often stylized in various ways, but his actual given names were Edward and Estlin.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I can try to recall if I've ever seen his signature or any official documents with his name. I think his signature would likely show his full name or at least the initials \"E. E.\" but I'm not certain.\n\nAlso, I recall that his poetry often played with capitalization and punctuation, which might be why he preferred his name to be written without them.\n\nGiven all this, I'm fairly confident that \"E E\" stands for Edward Estlin.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Edward Estlin.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Edward Estlin}} \\]"
