                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendation for the maximum intake of free sugars. The options are:\n\nA. <5%\n\nB. 5-10%\n\nC. <10%\n\nD. >10%\n\nI need to figure out which one is correct. I remember that the WHO issues guidelines on nutrition, including recommendations on sugar intake. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact percentage they suggest for free sugars.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what free sugars are. I think they're sugars that are added to foods and drinks, like table sugar, honey, and even sugars in fruits and syrups. Wait, but fruits also contain natural sugars, which might be considered differently. Maybe I need to double-check that.\n\nLet me search for the definition of free sugars according to the WHO. Oh, here it is: \"Free sugars are all monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, plus sugars naturally present in honey, syrups and fruit juices.\" So, that includes things like sucrose, glucose, fructose, and so on, but excludes sugars in whole fruits and vegetables because they are bound within the cell walls.\n\nAlright, so now I know what free sugars are. Next, what's the recommended maximum intake? I think there was a guideline a few years back that suggested limiting free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake, but I'm not sure if that's still the most current advice.\n\nMaybe I should look up the latest WHO guidelines on sugar intake. Let me see if I can find that. Oh, here's a link to the WHO's website on nutrition recommendations.\n\nAccording to this, the WHO has issued guidelines on sugar intake for adults and children. They recommend that adults and children should reduce their intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake, and further reducing to below 5% is suggested for additional health benefits.\n\nHmm, so option C is <10%, which matches the first part of the recommendation. But option A is <5%, which seems to be the more stringent suggestion for additional benefits.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"the maximum intake of free sugars by individuals within populations should be...\" and it's asking for the strong recommendation. Is the strong recommendation the <10%, and the <5% is a conditional recommendation?\n\nLet me read the guideline again. It says: \"WHO suggests that countries should consider recommendations to reduce the intake of free sugars to less than 5% of total energy intake.\"\n\nSo, it seems like the primary recommendation is <10%, and there's an additional suggestion to aim for <5% for further health benefits.\n\nTherefore, the strong recommendation is <10%, and the more ambitious target is <5%.\n\nSo, based on that, option C (<10%) would be the correct answer for the strong recommendation.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check another source. Maybe I can find a summary or an abstract of the guideline.\n\nYes, here's a summary: \"WHO recommends that both adults and children should reduce their intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake, and further reducing to below 5% is suggested for additional health benefits.\"\n\nSo, again, it confirms that the core recommendation is <10%, and <5% is an additional advice.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. <10%.\n\nI think that's it. Now, I feel confident about this.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
