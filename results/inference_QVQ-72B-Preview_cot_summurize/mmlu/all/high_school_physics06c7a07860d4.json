                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a proton entering a region with a constant magnetic field, B, of 1.0 Tesla. Its initial speed is 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s, and it makes a 30-degree angle with the direction of the magnetic field. We need to find its speed 4 seconds after it enters the magnetic field.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how a charged particle behaves in a magnetic field. I know that a charged particle moving perpendicular to a magnetic field moves in a circular path because the magnetic force provides the centripetal force needed for circular motion. The force is given by F = qvB sin\u03b8, where q is the charge, v is the velocity, B is the magnetic field, and \u03b8 is the angle between v and B.\n\nIn this case, the proton has a charge q = 1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C, and it's entering the field at a 30-degree angle. So, the magnetic force acting on it will cause it to move in a helical path because the velocity has both a component parallel to B and a component perpendicular to B.\n\nLet's break down the velocity into components:\n\n1. The component parallel to B: v_parallel = v * cos\u03b8\n\n2. The component perpendicular to B: v_perpendicular = v * sin\u03b8\n\nGiven that \u03b8 = 30 degrees, and v = 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s, we can calculate these components.\n\nFirst, find cos 30\u00b0 and sin 30\u00b0:\n\ncos 30\u00b0 = \u221a3/2 \u2248 0.866\n\nsin 30\u00b0 = 1/2 = 0.5\n\nSo,\n\nv_parallel = (1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s) * 0.866 \u2248 1.299 \u00d7 10^6 m/s\n\nv_perpendicular = (1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s) * 0.5 = 7.5 \u00d7 10^5 m/s\n\nNow, the magnetic force only affects the component of the velocity that's perpendicular to the magnetic field. So, the parallel component will continue unchanged, while the perpendicular component will change direction due to the magnetic force.\n\nThe magnetic force is:\n\nF = qv_perpendicular B sin\u03b8\n\nBut since v_perpendicular is already perpendicular to B, sin\u03b8 = sin 30\u00b0 = 0.5\n\nSo, F = (1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C)(7.5 \u00d7 10^5 m/s)(1.0 T)(0.5) = (1.6 \u00d7 10^-19)(7.5 \u00d7 10^5)(0.5) = (1.6 \u00d7 7.5 \u00d7 0.5) \u00d7 10^-19 \u00d7 10^5 = (6 \u00d7 10^-19) N\n\nWait, let's double-check that calculation.\n\nFirst, calculate 1.6 \u00d7 7.5 = 12\n\nThen, 12 \u00d7 0.5 = 6\n\nSo, F = 6 \u00d7 10^-19 N\n\nNow, the force causes the proton to move in a circular path in the plane perpendicular to B. The radius of this path can be found using the centripetal force formula:\n\nF = m v_perpendicular^2 / r\n\nWhere m is the mass of the proton, approximately 1.67 \u00d7 10^-27 kg.\n\nSo,\n\nr = m v_perpendicular^2 / F\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nr = (1.67 \u00d7 10^-27 kg)(7.5 \u00d7 10^5 m/s)^2 / (6 \u00d7 10^-19 N)\n\nFirst, calculate (7.5 \u00d7 10^5)^2 = 5.625 \u00d7 10^11 m\u00b2/s\u00b2\n\nThen, r = (1.67 \u00d7 10^-27)(5.625 \u00d7 10^11) / (6 \u00d7 10^-19)\n\nLet's compute the numerator:\n\n1.67 \u00d7 5.625 = 9.4125\n\nSo, 9.4125 \u00d7 10^-27 \u00d7 10^11 = 9.4125 \u00d7 10^-16 m\n\nDenominator: 6 \u00d7 10^-19 N\n\nNow, r = 9.4125 \u00d7 10^-16 / (6 \u00d7 10^-19) = (9.4125 / 6) \u00d7 10^-16 / 10^-19 = 1.56875 \u00d7 10^3 m\n\nSo, r \u2248 1.569 \u00d7 10^3 m\n\nNow, the angular frequency (\u03c9) of the motion is given by:\n\n\u03c9 = v_perpendicular / r\n\nWait, no. Actually, the angular frequency is given by:\n\n\u03c9 = q B / m\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\n\u03c9 = (1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C)(1.0 T) / (1.67 \u00d7 10^-27 kg) \u2248 (1.6 / 1.67) \u00d7 10^8 \u2248 0.958 \u00d7 10^8 rad/s \u2248 9.58 \u00d7 10^7 rad/s\n\nAlternatively, the frequency f = \u03c9 / (2\u03c0)\n\nBut I'm not sure if we need frequency right now.\n\nNow, the proton's motion consists of:\n\n- A constant velocity component parallel to B: v_parallel = 1.299 \u00d7 10^6 m/s\n\n- A circular motion perpendicular to B with radius r and angular frequency \u03c9\n\nSo, the perpendicular velocity component rotates in a circle with angular frequency \u03c9.\n\nTherefore, the velocity at any time t can be expressed as:\n\nv(t) = v_parallel + v_perpendicular * (cos(\u03c9t), sin(\u03c9t))\n\nBut since v_perpendicular is initially in the x-direction (assuming B is in the z-direction), and it's rotating in the xy-plane.\n\nWait, more precisely, the perpendicular velocity can be decomposed into x and y components that oscillate sinusoidally with time.\n\nSo, v_x(t) = v_perpendicular * cos(\u03c9t)\n\nv_y(t) = v_perpendicular * sin(\u03c9t)\n\nv_z(t) = v_parallel\n\nTherefore, the total velocity vector at time t is:\n\nv(t) = v_x(t) \u00ee + v_y(t) \u0135 + v_z(t) k\u0302\n\n= v_perpendicular * cos(\u03c9t) \u00ee + v_perpendicular * sin(\u03c9t) \u0135 + v_parallel k\u0302\n\nNow, to find the speed, which is the magnitude of the velocity vector:\n\nspeed = |v(t)| = sqrt(v_x(t)^2 + v_y(t)^2 + v_z(t)^2)\n\n= sqrt( (v_perpendicular * cos(\u03c9t))^2 + (v_perpendicular * sin(\u03c9t))^2 + (v_parallel)^2 )\n\n= sqrt( v_perpendicular^2 (cos^2(\u03c9t) + sin^2(\u03c9t)) + v_parallel^2 )\n\n= sqrt( v_perpendicular^2 (1) + v_parallel^2 )\n\n= sqrt( v_perpendicular^2 + v_parallel^2 )\n\nWait a minute, that's interesting. The speed is constant over time because the terms involving time cancel out in the Pythagorean calculation.\n\nSo, the speed doesn't change with time; it remains constant.\n\nTherefore, the proton's speed 4 seconds after entering the magnetic field is the same as its initial speed, which is 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 5.0 \u00d7 10^5 m/s\n\nB. 7.5 \u00d7 10^5 m/s\n\nC. 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s\n\nD. 3.0 \u00d7 10^6 m/s\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this conclusion to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nWe know that magnetic fields do no work on charged particles because the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity. Therefore, the speed should remain constant since work is done to change kinetic energy, and kinetic energy depends on speed squared.\n\nSo, yes, the speed should not change over time in an ideal magnetic field without any other forces acting on the particle.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
