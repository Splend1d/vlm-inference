                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this concept called \"passive personality jurisdiction.\" It sounds a bit complicated, but I think I can figure it out by breaking it down.\n\nFirst off, jurisdiction generally refers to the legal authority that a court has to hear and decide a case. So, passive personality jurisdiction must be a specific type of jurisdiction based on certain criteria.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. It is jurisdiction based on the nationality of the offender.\n\nB. It is jurisdiction based on where the offence was committed.\n\nC. It is jurisdiction based on the nationality of the victims.\n\nD. It is jurisdiction based on the country where the legal person was registered.\n\nI need to determine which one of these accurately describes passive personality jurisdiction.\n\nLet me start by understanding what \"passive personality\" means in this context. The term \"personality\" here likely refers to the nationality or citizenship of a person involved in the case. So, passive personality jurisdiction probably involves the nationality of someone who is not the offender.\n\nIn active personality jurisdiction, a state may exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed by its nationals, regardless of where the crime was committed. So, in this case, it's based on the nationality of the offender. But that's option A, and the question is about passive personality jurisdiction, which seems different.\n\nPassive personality jurisdiction, I recall, is when a state exercises jurisdiction over crimes committed against its nationals, again regardless of where the crime was committed. So, in this case, it's based on the nationality of the victim, not the offender.\n\nWait a minute, that seems to align with option C: jurisdiction based on the nationality of the victims.\n\nLet me double-check this. If passive personality jurisdiction is about protecting the interests of a state's own citizens who are victims of crimes committed abroad, then yes, it would be based on the nationality of the victims.\n\nOption A is about the nationality of the offender, which is more related to active personality jurisdiction.\n\nOption B is about where the offence was committed, which sounds like territorial jurisdiction.\n\nOption D mentions the country where the legal person was registered, which might relate to corporate law or international business disputes, but not directly to passive personality jurisdiction.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider an example. Suppose a citizen of Country X is murdered in Country Y by a citizen of Country Z. Under passive personality jurisdiction, would Country X have the right to prosecute the murderer?\n\nWell, according to the principle of passive personality jurisdiction, Country X, as the home country of the victim, could claim jurisdiction over the crime because the victim was a national of Country X. So, in this case, it's indeed based on the nationality of the victim.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct description of passive personality jurisdiction.\n\nTo sum it up, passive personality jurisdiction is based on the nationality of the victims, allowing a state to exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed against its nationals, regardless of where the crime took place or who committed it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
