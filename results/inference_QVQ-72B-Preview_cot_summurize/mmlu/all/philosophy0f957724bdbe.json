                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about Cicero's moral philosophy. The options are:\n\nA. follow our conscience.\n\nB. follow the laws.\n\nC. follow religious edicts.\n\nD. follow Nature as our guide.\n\nAnd the question is: if we do any of these, will we never go morally astray? The answer is supposed to be one of these options.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who Cicero was and what his views on morality were. Cicero was a Roman philosopher, statesman, and orator who lived in the 1st century BC. He was deeply influenced by Greek philosophy, particularly Stoicism, which emphasized living in accordance with nature and virtue.\n\nSo, given that background, I think option D, \"follow Nature as our guide,\" aligns with Stoic thought. The Stoics believed that living in accordance with nature was the path to virtue and happiness. They meant \"nature\" in a cosmic sense, meaning the rational order of the universe, not just the natural world around us.\n\nBut let's consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is \"follow our conscience.\" Conscience is an interesting concept. It's often seen as our internal moral compass, guiding us to do right. However, Cicero might argue that conscience itself needs to be informed by a higher principle, perhaps reason or nature, to be reliable. So, maybe following conscience isn't sufficient on its own.\n\nOption B is \"follow the laws.\" Cicero was a strong advocate for the rule of law and believed in the importance of legal systems. However, he also distinguished between just and unjust laws. In his work \"On the Laws,\" he argues that true law is right reason in agreement with nature. So, following laws might be moral if they align with natural law, but not if they contradict it.\n\nOption C is \"follow religious edicts.\" Religion played a significant role in Roman society, and Cicero respected traditional Roman religion. However, he was also critical of superstition and irrational beliefs. So, while religious edicts might guide some moral behavior, he might not see them as the ultimate guide to morality.\n\nGiven all that, option D seems the most fitting. Following nature as our guide resonates with Stoic philosophy, which Cicero admired. The Stoics believed that understanding and living in accordance with nature was the key to a moral life. They saw virtue as the highest good, and living virtuously meant living in harmony with the natural order.\n\nMoreover, Cicero often wrote about the importance of living according to nature. In his work \"On Duty,\" he discusses how our duties are derived from our nature as rational and social beings. So, if we follow nature's guide, we are fulfilling our proper roles and responsibilities, thereby avoiding moral straying.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider a specific quote from Cicero. In \"On the End of Goods and Evils,\" he says, \"To live in agreement with nature means to live in agreement with the order of things which reason prescribes as necessary.\" This suggests that following reason, which is part of human nature, is crucial for moral living.\n\nAnother relevant concept is Cicero's idea of \"natural law.\" He believed in a higher law, derived from nature, which transcends human-made laws. According to him, true justice and morality are based on this natural law. Therefore, following nature would mean adhering to this universal, rational principle, ensuring moral conduct.\n\nIn contrast, relying solely on conscience, laws, or religious edicts might not always guarantee moral behavior, as these can be flawed or misdirected without the underlying principle of nature and reason.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I believe the best answer is D: follow Nature as our guide.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
