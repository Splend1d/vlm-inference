                    "text": "So I have this problem here: On a Cartesian coordinate plane, points (1,2) and (7,4) are opposite vertices of a square. I need to find the area of the square. The options are 20, 34, 40, and \u221a40.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for two points to be opposite vertices of a square. In a square, opposite vertices are just that\u2014opposite corners. So, if I have a square ABCD, then A and C would be one pair of opposite vertices, and B and D would be the other pair.\n\nSo, in this problem, (1,2) and (7,4) are opposite vertices. Let's call them A and C, for simplicity.\n\nI know that in a square, all sides are equal, and all angles are right angles. Also, the diagonals of a square are equal in length and bisect each other at right angles.\n\nWait, but in this case, since it's a coordinate geometry problem, maybe I can find the distance between these two points and then use that to find the side length of the square.\n\nLet's recall the distance formula between two points (x\u2081, y\u2081) and (x\u2082, y\u2082) is \u221a[(x\u2082 - x\u2081)\u00b2 + (y\u2082 - y\u2081)\u00b2].\n\nSo, the distance between (1,2) and (7,4) is \u221a[(7 - 1)\u00b2 + (4 - 2)\u00b2] = \u221a[(6)\u00b2 + (2)\u00b2] = \u221a[36 + 4] = \u221a40.\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal of the square is \u221a40.\n\nWait, but in a square, the relationship between the side length and the diagonal is that the diagonal is equal to the side length multiplied by \u221a2.\n\nSo, if the diagonal is \u221a40, then the side length 's' would satisfy s\u221a2 = \u221a40.\n\nTherefore, s = \u221a40 / \u221a2 = \u221a(40/2) = \u221a20.\n\nThen, the area of the square would be s\u00b2 = (\u221a20)\u00b2 = 20.\n\nSo, the area should be 20.\n\nBut let me double-check this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should find the coordinates of the other two vertices and then calculate the area based on that.\n\nLet's denote the vertices as follows:\n\nLet A = (1,2)\n\nC = (7,4)\n\nThen, the other two vertices B and D should be such that AB = BC = CD = DA, and all angles are 90 degrees.\n\nTo find B and D, I can use the fact that the diagonals bisect each other at the midpoint.\n\nThe midpoint M of A and C is M = ((1+7)/2, (2+4)/2) = (4,3).\n\nSo, M is the center of the square.\n\nNow, to find B and D, I can think of them as being symmetrically placed with respect to M.\n\nLet's consider the vector from M to A: MA = A - M = (1 - 4, 2 - 3) = (-3,-1).\n\nSimilarly, MC = C - M = (7 - 4, 4 - 3) = (3,1).\n\nWait, but MC should be the same as MA but in the opposite direction, since M is the midpoint.\n\nActually, MC = (7 - 4, 4 - 3) = (3,1), which is indeed the negative of MA = (-3,-1).\n\nNow, to find B and D, I need to rotate or find points that are perpendicular to this direction.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the side length and the properties of squares in coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the distance formula to find the side length.\n\nWait, earlier I found that the diagonal is \u221a40, and since in a square, the area is (side)^2, and the relationship between side and diagonal is s\u221a2 = diagonal, so s = diagonal / \u221a2 = \u221a40 / \u221a2 = \u221a20, and area = (\u221a20)^2 = 20.\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nBut let me try another approach to confirm.\n\nLet's consider the coordinates of the other two vertices.\n\nLet\u2019s denote A = (1,2) and C = (7,4).\n\nLet\u2019s assume that B and D are the other two vertices.\n\nIn a square, the vectors AB and AD should be perpendicular, and of equal length.\n\nLet\u2019s denote B = (x,y).\n\nThen, vector AB = (x - 1, y - 2), and vector AD would be perpendicular to AB and of the same magnitude.\n\nWait, this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the center of the square is M = (4,3), and the sides are perpendicular to each other, maybe I can use rotation matrices to find B and D.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the vector from M to A: MA = (-3,-1).\n\nTo find MB, I can rotate MA by 90 degrees.\n\nRotating a vector (a,b) by 90 degrees gives (-b, a), so MB = (1, -3).\n\nTherefore, B = M + MB = (4 + 1, 3 - 3) = (5, 0).\n\nSimilarly, MD = MC rotated by 90 degrees.\n\nWait, MC is (3,1), which is MA rotated by 180 degrees.\n\nWait, no. MC should be the same length as MA but in the opposite direction, but actually, in coordinates, MC = (7 - 4, 4 - 3) = (3,1), while MA = (-3,-1).\n\nSo, to find D, I can take M and add the vector obtained by rotating MB by 90 degrees.\n\nRotating (1,-3) by 90 degrees gives (3,1), so D = M + (3,1) = (7,4), but that's already C.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the side vectors are perpendicular and of equal length.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that from A, to get to B, I move horizontally and vertically to form a square.\n\nSo, if I move horizontally from A to, say, B, then vertically from B to D, and then horizontally back to C.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use the fact that in a square, the vectors AB and AD are perpendicular and of equal length.\n\nSo, let\u2019s denote AB = (x - 1, y - 2), and AD = (z - 1, w - 2).\n\nThese two vectors should satisfy:\n\nAB \u00b7 AD = 0 (dot product is zero for perpendicular vectors)\n\nAnd |AB| = |AD|\n\nSo, (x - 1)(z - 1) + (y - 2)(w - 2) = 0\n\nAnd (x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = (z - 1)^2 + (w - 2)^2\n\nThis seems a bit involved. Maybe sticking with the earlier approach is better.\n\nGiven that the diagonal is \u221a40, and in a square, area = (diagonal^2)/2, so area = (\u221a40)^2 / 2 = 40 / 2 = 20.\n\nYes, that seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, using the distance formula, distance between A and C is \u221a[(7-1)^2 + (4-2)^2] = \u221a[36 + 4] = \u221a40.\n\nThen, the side length s satisfies s\u221a2 = \u221a40, so s = \u221a40 / \u221a2 = \u221a20.\n\nArea = s^2 = (\u221a20)^2 = 20.\n\nTherefore, the area of the square is 20.\n\nSo, the answer is A. 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 20} \\]"
