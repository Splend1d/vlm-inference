                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about Arthur's \"greater moral evil rule.\" It's a bit confusing, but let me try to understand it step by step.\n\nSo, the question is: \"The principle Arthur calls 'the greater moral evil rule' says that...\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. People are entitled to keep their earnings only if there is no way for them to prevent a greater evil by giving them away.\n\nB. Being rich is a great moral evil, and as such we should all strive to live on a moderate income.\n\nC. Two moral evils do not make a moral good.\n\nD. Morality itself is a great evil.\n\nHmm, okay. First, I need to figure out what \"the greater moral evil rule\" is all about. From the title, it seems like it's about comparing different evils and deciding which one is worse, and possibly how to act based on that comparison.\n\nLet me look at option A: \"People are entitled to keep their earnings only if there is no way for them to prevent a greater evil by giving them away.\"\n\nThis suggests that if giving away your earnings could prevent a bigger evil, then you shouldn't keep them. In other words, keeping your earnings is only acceptable if there's no better way to use them to prevent a greater evil. This sounds like it's related to ethical decisions about wealth and charity.\n\nOption B: \"Being rich is a great moral evil, and as such we should all strive to live on a moderate income.\"\n\nThis is a strong statement. It's saying that wealth itself is a moral evil, and therefore, people should aim to live modestly. This seems more like a prescriptive moral stance on wealth rather than a rule about comparing different evils.\n\nOption C: \"Two moral evils do not make a moral good.\"\n\nThis sounds like a general moral principle, maybe related to the idea that wrongs don't cancel each other out to produce something right. It's a bit too vague and general to seem directly related to the concept of a \"greater moral evil rule.\"\n\nOption D: \"Morality itself is a great evil.\"\n\nThis is an extreme position, suggesting that following moral principles is, in itself, evil. This doesn't align with typical moral philosophies and seems out of place here.\n\nGiven these options, option A seems the most relevant to the idea of a \"greater moral evil rule.\" It involves comparing the consequences of keeping one's earnings versus giving them away to prevent a greater evil. It's about making choices based on which outcome would prevent a larger evil.\n\nOption B is more about the inherent morality of being rich, which doesn't directly relate to comparing different evils in decision-making.\n\nOptions C and D are more about general moral principles and don't specifically address the concept of a \"greater moral evil.\"\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A: People are entitled to keep their earnings only if there is no way for them to prevent a greater evil by giving them away.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any possibility that another option could be right.\n\nOption B: Being rich is a great moral evil, and as such we should all strive to live on a moderate income.\n\nThis seems more like a statement about the nature of wealth being evil, rather than a rule about comparing different evils to make moral decisions.\n\nOption C: Two moral evils do not make a moral good.\n\nThis is a general moral principle, perhaps related to the idea that two wrongs don't make a right. It doesn't directly address the concept of a \"greater moral evil rule.\"\n\nOption D: Morality itself is a great evil.\n\nThis is a nihilistic view, denying the value of morality, which isn't typically associated with discussions of moral rules or principles.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I still believe that A is the correct answer. The \"greater moral evil rule\" is about entitlement to keep earnings based on whether giving them away could prevent a greater evil.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I should consider an example. Suppose someone has earnings that they could donate to charity, and that donation could prevent a greater evil elsewhere. According to this rule, they should donate unless there's no way their donation could prevent a greater evil.\n\nThat makes sense. So, yes, option A seems to be the best fit for \"the greater moral evil rule.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
