                    "text": "So I've got this property law problem here, and I need to figure out who owns what in this situation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, a father deeds a piece of real estate to his three daughters using a warranty deed. The deed says that the title is conveyed to them \"as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, and not as tenants in common.\" Okay, so joint tenancy is a type of ownership where each owner has an equal share in the property, and when one owner dies, their share passes directly to the surviving owners, not through their will.\n\nNow, one of the sisters decides to convey an \"undivided one-third interest\" to a third party while all three sisters are still alive. Then, this third party dies and leaves her one-third interest to her son through her will. The question is whether the son's ownership interest is enforceable against the two surviving sisters, who are claiming that they now own 100% of the property based on the joint tenancy's right of survivorship.\n\nAlright, so the key here is understanding what happens when a joint tenant tries to convey her interest to someone outside the joint tenancy. I recall that in a joint tenancy, each tenant has an undivided interest in the whole property, and generally, if one joint tenant sells her interest, that can sever the joint tenancy as to her share, creating a tenancy in common for that share.\n\nSo, when the sister conveyed her one-third interest to the third party, did that sever the joint tenancy for that share? It seems like it did, because she transferred her interest to someone outside the original joint tenancy.\n\nNow, the third party has a one-third interest in the property, which she acquired from the sister. When the third party dies and leaves her one-third interest to her son via her will, that should be valid, right? Because she owned that interest and could dispose of it through her will.\n\nBut the two surviving sisters are claiming that they own 100% of the property based on the joint tenancy's right of survivorship. However, since the sister who conveyed her share to the third party severed her interest, her share shouldn't pass to the surviving sisters upon her death. Instead, the third party owned that share, and upon the third party's death, it passed to her son.\n\nSo, it seems like the son does have a valid ownership interest in that one-third share, despite what the sisters are claiming.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. No, because each joint tenant owns an equal and undivided interest in the whole of the property, making invalid the sister's attempted conveyance of a one-third interest.\n\nHmm, this option suggests that the sister couldn't convey her one-third interest because of the nature of joint tenancy. But I think that's not accurate. Joint tenants can convey their interest to others, which severs the joint tenancy as to that share.\n\nB. Yes, only a will can create a joint tenancy; the deed was invalid for that purpose and resulted in a tenancy in common by operation of law.\n\nWait, this seems confusing. Generally, a deed can create a joint tenancy if it specifies \"joint tenants with right of survivorship.\" So, if the deed said that, it should have created a joint tenancy. Maybe this option is incorrect.\n\nC. Yes, because the conveyance severed the joint tenancy, and the third party took a one-third interest that she could pass by will to her son.\n\nThis seems to align with my understanding. The conveyance by the sister severed her interest, creating a tenancy in common for that share, and the third party could then pass it on through her will.\n\nD. No, because the selling sister did not take steps to get a court order to sever the joint tenancy prior to conveying a deed to a third party.\n\nI don't think a court order is necessary to sever a joint tenancy. Simply conveying the interest to someone else is usually sufficient to sever that share.\n\nGiven this analysis, I think option C is the correct answer. The conveyance by the sister severed her interest, creating a tenancy in common for that share, and the third party could then pass it on through her will to her son. Therefore, the son's ownership interest is enforceable against the two surviving sisters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
