                    "text": "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the way red blood cells process glucose. This condition is particularly common in populations from areas where malaria is or was endemic, such as Africa, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The inheritance pattern of G6PD deficiency is crucial for understanding how it is passed from parents to offspring and for genetic counseling.\n\nThe G6PD gene is located on the X chromosome, which means it's a sex-linked gene. The X chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes; females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. Given this chromosomal location, G6PD deficiency is an X-linked trait.\n\nNow, whether it's dominant or recessive is another part of the inheritance pattern. In general, dominant traits require only one copy of the gene to be expressed, whereas recessive traits require two copies. For G6PD deficiency, the typical pattern is X-linked recessive.\n\nLet's delve deeper into this. In males, who have only one X chromosome, a single copy of the mutated G6PD gene will cause the deficiency because there's no corresponding gene on the Y chromosome to mask it. Therefore, males are more frequently affected and typically show more severe symptoms.\n\nIn females, who have two X chromosomes, the situation is different. If a female inherits one mutated G6PD gene and one normal gene, she is a carrier. Typically, such females do not show symptoms because the normal gene on the other X chromosome produces enough functional G6PD enzyme to prevent significant deficiency. However, due to a phenomenon called X-inactivation, where one of the two X chromosomes in females is randomly turned off in each cell, some females may have enough cells with the mutated gene expressed to experience mild symptoms, especially under certain stresses like infection or medication use.\n\nThis partial expression in females is why G6PD deficiency is considered X-linked recessive. The recessive nature means that typically, two copies of the mutated gene are needed for the full expression of the condition, which occurs in males who have only one X chromosome carrying the mutation.\n\nIt's also worth noting that there are different variants of G6PD deficiency, and their severity can vary. Some variants may present with milder symptoms, while others can lead to more severe health issues, particularly hemolytic anemia triggered by certain medications, infections, or foods.\n\nIn summary, G6PD deficiency is primarily an X-linked recessive disorder. Males are more commonly affected and show more severe symptoms because they have only one X chromosome. Females can be carriers, and while they generally do not show symptoms, some may experience mild symptoms due to X-inactivation patterns.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer from the provided options is:\n\nD. X-linked recessive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
