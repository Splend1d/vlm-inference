The options are:\n\nA. Social action\n\nB. Social facts\n\nC. Class relations\n\nD. Cultural dynamics\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what Durkheim is known for. I remember that Durkheim was a pioneer in sociology, and he emphasized the importance of studying society as a whole, not just individual behaviors. He was big on understanding how society influences individual actions.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Social action \u2013 I think this might be more associated with Max Weber, another famous sociologist. Weber focused on understanding how individuals' actions are shaped by their subjective meanings and purposes. So, maybe not Durkheim's main focus.\n\nB. Social facts \u2013 This rings a bell. Durkheim is well-known for coining the term \"social facts\" to describe the ways in which society influences individual behavior through norms, values, and structures that are external to individuals but constrain or shape their actions.\n\nC. Class relations \u2013 This sounds a lot like Karl Marx's perspective, which centers on the conflicts between different social classes, especially between the bourgeoisie (owners of production means) and the proletariat (workers). While Durkheim did study social stratification, his work wasn't primarily about class struggle.\n\nD. Cultural dynamics \u2013 This seems broad, but it involves the study of how culture changes over time or across different groups. While Durkheim did contribute to our understanding of culture, especially through his work on religion, this doesn't seem to be his primary focus.\n\nGiven this, option B, social facts, seems the most accurate answer. Durkheim argued that sociology should study social facts, which are the collective ways of behaving that are external to individuals but exert pressure on them to conform. He believed that these social facts are the building blocks of society and that understanding them is crucial to understanding how societies function and change.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll think about some of his famous works. For example, in \"Suicide,\" Durkheim studied suicide rates in different societies and showed that they were influenced by social factors like integration and regulation within society. This is a classic example of studying social facts and their impact on individual behavior.\n\nAnother work of his, \"The Division of Labor in Society,\" explores how specialization and interdependence among individuals shape social structure. Again, this points to his focus on social facts and how they emerge from and influence society.\n\nSo, after considering these points, I'm confident that B. Social facts is the correct answer to what Durkheim believed should be the primary focus of sociology.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
