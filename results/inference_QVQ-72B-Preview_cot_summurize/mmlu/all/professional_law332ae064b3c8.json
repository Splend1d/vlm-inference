                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving a teachers union picketing the local city school board over a decision to require higher certification for instructors in gifted and talented classes in elementary school. The school board is seeking a temporary injunction to stop the picketing, claiming that the teachers union has violated Section 101 of the city's picketing ordinance. I need to figure out what the court is most likely to do in this situation and why.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Section 101 says. It states that no picketing is allowed inside or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to public elementary and secondary schools without the express permission of the mayor. Additionally, applications for such permission must be filed at least three days before the picketing is intended to begin and must include the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing.\n\nFrom the scenario, it seems that the teachers union started picketing without obtaining permission from the mayor, as required by the ordinance. The school board is now seeking a temporary injunction to restrain further picketing, arguing that the union has violated Section 101.\n\nNow, there are a few options here:\n\nA. Grant relief, because the teachers union failed to follow the procedure outlined in the ordinance.\n\nB. Grant relief, because the ordinance is constitutional.\n\nC. Deny relief, because the picketing ordinance was unconstitutional on its face.\n\nD. Deny relief, because the ordinance does not provide procedural due process.\n\nI need to think through these options one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: grant relief because the teachers union failed to follow the procedure outlined in the ordinance. This seems straightforward. If the union didn't get permission from the mayor and didn't follow the application process required by the ordinance, then they are in violation of the law. The court might be inclined to grant the injunction to enforce the ordinance.\n\nHowever, before the court grants relief based solely on the violation of the ordinance, it should also consider whether the ordinance itself is lawful and constitutional. Just because there's an ordinance doesn't mean it's valid or enforceable.\n\nThat brings me to options B and C. Option B says grant relief because the ordinance is constitutional, while option C says deny relief because the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face.\n\nI need to consider whether the ordinance is constitutional. Specifically, does it violate any rights or principles protected by the Constitution?\n\nPicketing is a form of speech and assembly, which are protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. However, the government can regulate the time, place, and manner of such activities, provided that the regulations are content-neutral, serve a significant government interest, and leave open ample alternative channels for communication.\n\nLooking at Section 101, it requires prior permission from the mayor to picket near schools and imposes a three-day advance notice requirement. This seems like a regulation of the place and manner of picketing.\n\nIs this regulation content-neutral? That is, does it favor or disfavor picketing based on the subject matter or the views expressed? From the text, it appears to be content-neutral because it applies to all picketing without distinguishing based on the message or cause.\n\nThe ordinance also serves a significant government interest. It's likely intended to maintain order and safety around schools, prevent disruptions to education, and ensure that picketing doesn't interfere with the operation of schools or the well-being of students and staff.\n\nMoreover, the advance notice requirement allows the city to prepare for any potential issues and to ensure that picketing is conducted in an orderly fashion.\n\nGiven these considerations, the ordinance seems reasonably tailored to achieve its objectives without targeting specific content or viewpoints.\n\nTherefore, it's probable that the ordinance is constitutional, which would support option B: grant relief because the ordinance is constitutional.\n\nBut wait, option A also suggests granting relief based on the union's failure to follow the procedure, regardless of the ordinance's constitutionality. However, if the ordinance were unconstitutional, then the union's failure to follow it wouldn't be a valid reason to grant relief, because the ordinance itself wouldn't be enforceable.\n\nBut since I've concluded that the ordinance is likely constitutional, option B seems appropriate.\n\nHowever, let's consider option D: deny relief because the ordinance does not provide procedural due process.\n\nProcedural due process generally requires that before depriving someone of life, liberty, or property, the government must follow fair procedures, including notice and an opportunity to be heard.\n\nIn this context, is the ordinance depriving someone of a protected interest without adequate procedures?\n\nThe ordinance requires advance permission from the mayor to picket near schools and sets a three-day notice period. Assuming that the mayor's decision is made in a fair and non-arbitrary manner, and that there are mechanisms for appeal or review of the decision, then the ordinance likely provides sufficient procedural safeguards.\n\nIf there's no indication that the mayor's permission process is arbitrary or lacks due process, then this argument doesn't hold water.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a concern that the ordinance gives too much discretion to the mayor, allowing for potential abuse or discrimination in granting permission.\n\nBut again, without specific information suggesting that the mayor's discretion is unbounded or that the process lacks fairness, it's hard to conclude that the ordinance violates procedural due process.\n\nTherefore, option D seems less likely.\n\nBetween options A and B, both suggest granting relief, but for different reasons. Option A focuses on the union's failure to follow the ordinance's procedures, while option B emphasizes the constitutionality of the ordinance.\n\nHowever, in reality, courts would likely consider both factors. They would first determine whether the ordinance is constitutional. If it is, then the union's violation of the ordinance would justify granting the injunction.\n\nIf the ordinance were unconstitutional, then the union's failure to comply with it wouldn't be a valid basis for relief, and the court might deny the injunction on that ground.\n\nBut since I've concluded that the ordinance is likely constitutional, option B seems the most appropriate choice.\n\nWait a minute, option C says deny relief because the picketing ordinance was unconstitutional on its face. But based on my analysis, the ordinance appears to be constitutional, so this option doesn't align with my conclusions.\n\nOption A suggests granting relief because the union didn't follow the ordinance's procedures. But if the ordinance itself is unconstitutional, then the union's failure to comply with it wouldn't be a valid reason to grant relief.\n\nHowever, since I believe the ordinance is constitutional, option B is more accurate.\n\nBut perhaps there's another way to look at this. Maybe the court would grant relief based on the union's conduct, regardless of the ordinance's validity, and leave it to another process to challenge the ordinance's constitutionality.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the court would consider the constitutionality first and, if finding the ordinance valid, proceed to enforce it by granting the injunction.\n\nIn practice, courts do consider the validity of the laws they are asked to enforce, especially when constitutional questions are raised.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the ordinance appears to be constitutional, the court would likely grant relief, either because the union violated the ordinance (option A) or because the ordinance is constitutional (option B).\n\nBetween these two, option B seems more comprehensive, as it addresses the validity of the ordinance itself, which underpins the request for relief.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is option B: grant relief, because the ordinance is constitutional.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
