                    "text": "Alright, I've got this passage to analyze. It seems to be about teaching grammar, and there are two main ways mentioned: through experience with discourse, which involves different word forms and sentence constructions, or by analyzing dummy sentences and diagramming parts. The author says that plenty of discursive experience is what really teaches grammar because it exercises judgment and provides language intake. On the other hand, formal grammar study has been proven irrelevant. The author also mentions that politics, more than pedagogy, is slowing down the change in the curriculum to fit this truth.\n\nSo, the question is, what is the author arguing? Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Using language in a wide variety of situations improves grammar.\n\nWell, that seems to align with the idea of discursive experience. The author says that discursive experience is what really teaches grammar because it exercises judgment and provides language intake. So, using language in various situations would fall under discursive experience, which according to the author, is effective in teaching grammar. That seems like a possible answer.\n\nB. Good judgment can be improved by studying the rules of formal grammar.\n\nBut the author says that formal grammar study is irrelevant and that discursive experience is what exercises judgment. So, this option suggests that studying formal grammar improves judgment, which contradicts what the author is saying. Therefore, this can't be the author's argument.\n\nC. Analyzing and diagramming provide exercise in logical thinking.\n\nThe passage mentions analyzing dummy sentences and diagramming parts as a way of teaching grammar. However, the author states that formal grammar study has been proven irrelevant. So, even if analyzing and diagramming provide exercise in logical thinking, the author doesn't see them as effective for teaching grammar. Therefore, this option doesn't align with the author's argument.\n\nD. Formal study of grammar improves writing ability.\n\nThis directly contradicts the author's point that formal grammar study is irrelevant. The author is arguing against formal grammar study as an effective way to teach grammar, so claiming that it improves writing ability would be against the author's position.\n\nGiven these considerations, option A seems to be the closest to the author's argument. The author is emphasizing the importance of discursive experience in teaching grammar, which involves using language in a wide variety of situations.\n\nBut let me double-check. The author says that discursive experience exercises judgment and provides language intake, and that formal grammar study is irrelevant. So, the author is advocating for more discursive experience in teaching grammar, which aligns with option A.\n\nOption A states that using language in a wide variety of situations improves grammar. That's essentially what discursive experience entails\u2014using language in different contexts, which helps in understanding and internalizing grammar rules through practice and exposure.\n\nMoreover, the author mentions that politics is retarding the change in the curriculum to fit this truth, implying that the current curriculum might not prioritize discursive experience enough, and there's a need to change that.\n\nTherefore, the author is arguing that using language in a wide variety of situations improves grammar, which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
