                    "text": " So I'm trying to understand this concept called \"Rawls's original position.\" It sounds like a thought experiment in political philosophy, right? John Rawls was a philosopher who wrote about justice and how societies should be structured. So, in this original position, people are behind a \"veil of ignorance,\" meaning they don't know where they'll end up in society. That seems like a pretty important concept for thinking about fairness.\n\nThe question is asking about what information is available to occupants within this original position. The options are:\n\nA. knowledge of how one is talented compared to others\n\nB. knowledge of one's social status\n\nC. knowledge of one's abilities, such as intelligence, strength, and so on\n\nD. none of the above\n\nHmm, let me think about this. If I'm behind this veil of ignorance, what do I know and what don't I know?\n\nFirst, the veil of ignorance is supposed to strip away any knowledge of one's particular circumstances in society. So, things like one's race, gender, class, wealth, intelligence, strengths, weaknesses\u2014all that should be unknown. The idea is that without knowing your place in society, you can make fairer choices about how society should be organized.\n\nSo, option A is about knowing how talented you are compared to others. If you're behind the veil, you shouldn't know your own level of talent or how it stacks up against others. So, I think A is not allowed.\n\nOption B is knowledge of one's social status. Again, if you're under the veil of ignorance, you shouldn't know whether you're born into a rich family or a poor one, or what your social standing is. That seems like information that's hidden in the original position. So, B is probably not available.\n\nOption C is knowledge of one's abilities, like intelligence, strength, etc. Again, if you're behind the veil, you shouldn't know your own abilities. Otherwise, you might be biased in designing the principles of justice. For example, if you knew you were super intelligent, you might design a system that favors the intelligent at the expense of others. So, C is likely not available.\n\nGiven that, the answer seems to be D: none of the above. That is, in Rawls's original position, occupants don't have knowledge of their talents relative to others, their social status, or their specific abilities like intelligence and strength.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me recall some more about Rawls's theory. He thought that in this original position, people would choose principles of justice that maximize their own expected utility, given that they don't know their place in society. This leads to the famous \"veil of ignorance\" and the idea that we should choose principles that we'd want to live by, no matter who we turn out to be in society.\n\nHe also talked about \"primary goods,\" which are things that are universally desirable, like rights, opportunities, income, and self-respect. In the original position, people are assumed to know about these primary goods and their general importance, but not about their own specific endowments or circumstances that would give them an advantage or disadvantage in accessing these goods.\n\nSo, perhaps there is some knowledge that occupants do have in the original position. For example, they know about human psychology, the general facts of social cooperation, and the nature of primary goods. But crucially, they don't know their particular place in society.\n\nGiven that, the options A, B, and C all relate to particular facts about oneself that should be unknown in the original position. Therefore, the correct answer is D: none of the above.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if there's any exception where one might have knowledge of their own talents or social status in the original position. No, that doesn't align with Rawls's theory. The whole point is to ensure that the principles of justice are chosen without bias towards any particular group or individual.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it. The answer is D: none of the above.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
