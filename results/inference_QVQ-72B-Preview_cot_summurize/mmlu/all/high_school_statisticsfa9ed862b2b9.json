                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about correlation and GPAs. It says there's a correlation of r = 0.9 between the number of hours per day students study and their GPAs. And I need to choose which conclusion is reasonable based on that correlation. Let's see what options I have.\n\nOption A says that 90% of students who study receive high grades. Hmm, correlation doesn't imply causation, right? So just because there's a high correlation doesn't mean that studying causes high grades. It just means there's a relationship, but not necessarily that one causes the other. So, I'm a bit skeptical about this option.\n\nOption B says that 90% of students who receive high grades study a lot. Again, correlation is symmetric; it doesn't direction. So, if there's a high correlation between studying and grades, it doesn't necessarily mean that high grades cause more studying or vice versa. It's just showing that there's a strong relationship between the two variables. So, similar to option A, I'm not sure if this is the right conclusion.\n\nOption C says that 90% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day. This sounds like it's relating to the coefficient of determination, which is r squared. So, if r is 0.9, then r squared is 0.81, which is 81%. So, according to that, it should be 81%, not 90%. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption D says that 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day. That matches exactly with what I just thought about the coefficient of determination. R squared is 0.81, which is 81%, and that measures the proportion of the variance in GPAs explained by the variation in study hours.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option D is the correct conclusion. But just to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nCorrelation coefficient, r, measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. The coefficient of determination, which is r squared, indicates the proportion of the variance in one variable that is predictable from the other variable.\n\nSo, in this case, with r = 0.9, r squared is 0.81, meaning 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in the number of study hours per day. That aligns perfectly with option D.\n\nOption C is likely a mistake, as it states 90%, which would correspond to r squared being 0.9, but our r is 0.9, so r squared is 0.81.\n\nTherefore, the reasonable conclusion is option D: 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
