                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question about John Stuart Mill's views on free speech. The question is: \"According to Mill, censoring speech that is possibly true...\" and then there are four options. I need to pick the one that best represents Mill's position.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what Mill said about free speech. I know that Mill was a big advocate for free expression, especially in his work \"On Liberty.\" He argued that society should be as open as possible to different ideas and opinions, even those that might be unpopular or offensive.\n\nSo, specifically, what did Mill think about censoring speech that might be true? Let's think about this step by step.\n\nOption A says that it violates human dignity. Hmm, human dignity is an important concept, but I'm not sure if that's the primary concern for Mill in this context. Mill was more concerned with the harm principle and the idea that free speech is essential for discovering truth and fostering individuality. Maybe dignity is somehow related, but it doesn't seem like the direct focus here.\n\nOption B mentions failing a prima facie duty of honesty. Prima facie duties are moral obligations that hold unless they conflict with a stronger duty. Honesty is certainly a virtue, but again, I'm not sure if this is the core of Mill's argument against censoring possibly true speech. Maybe it's indirectly related, but probably not the best choice.\n\nOption C says that censoring possibly true speech is tantamount to asserting that you are infallible. This sounds interesting. Mill did emphasize that no one is infallible and that even the most widely accepted truths can be wrong. He believed that suppressing contrary opinions prevents us from testing and refining our own beliefs. So, if someone censors speech that might be true, are they essentially claiming to know for sure that it's false? That does sound like assuming infallibility. This seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOption D suggests that censoring possibly true speech is a risk worth taking if the speech is dangerous enough. Now, Mill is known for his harm principle, which states that the only reason for interfering with an individual's liberty is to prevent harm to others. So, if speech is truly dangerous, causing harm to others, then perhaps there is a case for limiting it. But the question is about speech that is possibly true, not necessarily dangerous. So, this seems to be missing the mark.\n\nLet me double-check. Mill would likely argue that even if speech is potentially dangerous, if it's possibly true, it should still be allowed because suppressing it assumes we know better than to let it be heard, which ties back to the idea of infallibility.\n\nSo, between the options, C seems to be the closest to Mill's position. He wouldn't necessarily see censoring possibly true speech as violating human dignity directly, nor as a failure of honesty, at least not primarily. And while there might be exceptions for speech that is dangerously harmful, the question is specifically about speech that is possibly true, regardless of its danger.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C: it is tantamount to asserting that you are infallible. That captures the essence of Mill's argument that censoring opinions, especially those that might be true, prevents the discovery of truth and assumes a level of certainty that no one possesses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
