The symbols are:\n\n- i: Italy\n\n- m: Marco\n\n- s: Spain\n\n- Mxyz: x moves to y from z\n\nSo, the predicate Mxyz means that person x moves to location y from location z.\n\nThe statement is about Marco not moving from Spain to Italy. So, the subject is Marco (m), the from location is Spain (s), and the to location is Italy (i). So, it should be Mmis, but since it's negative, it's ~Mmis.\n\nWait, let's double-check that. The predicate Mxyz is such that x moves to y from z. So, Mmis would mean Marco moves to Italy from Spain. So, if Marco doesn't move from Spain to Italy, that's the negation of Mmis, which is ~Mmis.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. ~Mmsi\n\nB. M~mis\n\nC. ~Mmis\n\nD. M~msi\n\nSo, option C seems correct: ~Mmis.\n\nBut let's make sure about the other options to be sure.\n\nOption A: ~Mmsi. This would be \"Marco does not move to Spain from Italy.\" That's different from the original statement, which is about not moving from Spain to Italy.\n\nOption B: M~mis. This seems a bit confusing. It looks like it's trying to apply negation to part of the predicate, but in standard predicate logic, negation applies to the whole predicate, not parts of it. So, this might not be a valid translation.\n\nOption D: M~msi. Similarly, this also seems to apply negation to part of the predicate, which is not standard in predicate logic.\n\nTherefore, the correct translation should be option C: ~Mmis.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any other way to interpret the statement or the symbols.\n\nLet me re-read the options:\n\nA. ~Mmsi\n\nB. M~mis\n\nC. ~Mmis\n\nD. M~msi\n\nOption C seems straightforward: Marco does not move to Italy from Spain.\n\nOption A: ~Mmsi: Marco does not move to Spain from Italy.\n\nOption B: M~mis: This seems like Marco moves to something not mis, but that doesn't make much sense in standard predicate logic.\n\nOption D: M~msi: Similarly, Marco moves to not msi, which also doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, yeah, option C seems to be the correct translation.\n\nI think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
