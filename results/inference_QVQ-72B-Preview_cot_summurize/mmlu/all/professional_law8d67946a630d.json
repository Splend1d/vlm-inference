Under a written contract, the plastic surgeon agreed to surgically remove the growth for $1,000. As the actress subsequently recalled, just before signing the agreement the parties orally agreed that if any additional medical procedures were required during surgery, they would be included in the $1,000 fee. The plastic surgeon, however, has no recollection of any such oral agreement. As agreed, the surgery was performed on an outpatient basis at the plastic surgeon's office. She applied a localized anesthesia that enabled the actress to remain conscious during surgery. While the operation was being performed, the plastic surgeon noticed another growth on the actress's neck. As the plastic surgeon subsequently recalled, she informed the actress about the growth and recommended that it be removed as well. According to the plastic surgeon's account, the actress orally agreed to have the growth removed for an additional $500. The actress has no recollection of any such oral agreement. The plastic surgeon performed both removal procedures satisfactorily. Following the surgery, the actress paid the plastic surgeon $1,000, but refused to pay any additional money for the removal of the second growth. After unsuccessfully attempting to collect the $500, the plastic surgeon brought suit against the actress to recover the additional fee. At trial, the plastic surgeon objected to the introduction of testimony regarding any oral agreement made before the written contract was signed. By the same token, the actress objected to the introduction of testimony concerning any oral agreement made during surgery. Will the plastic surgeon be entitled to recover the additional $500 if both offerings of parol evidence are admitted and believed?\n\nA. No, because the oral agreements contradict each other; neither would be enforceable under the so-called knock-out rule.\nB. No, because in removing the growth from the actress's neck, the plastic surgeon performed a legal duty already owed her that was neither doubtful nor the subject of an honest dispute.\nC. Yes, because the oral modification of the prior writing was fair and equitable in view of circumstances not anticipated by the parties when the writing was executed.\nD. Yes, because the actress would be unjustly enriched by not paying the additional $500, and injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of her oral promise.\n"

                    "text": "Alright, let's dive into this case. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, we have an actress who goes to a plastic surgeon to remove an abnormal growth on her right cheek. They agree in writing that the surgeon will remove the growth for $1,000. But here's the thing: the actress remembers that before signing the contract, they orally agreed that any additional procedures needed during surgery would be included in that $1,000. The surgeon, however, doesn't remember any such agreement. Hmm, that sets up a conflict right off the bat.\n\nThen, during the surgery, which was done on an outpatient basis with localized anesthesia, meaning the actress was conscious, the surgeon noticed another growth on her neck. The surgeon says she told the actress about this growth and recommended removing it for an extra $500. The actress supposedly agreed orally to this, but now she has no recollection of agreeing to pay extra for that second procedure. So, the surgeon performed both procedures and was paid $1,000, but the actress refused to pay the additional $500 for the neck growth removal.\n\nNow, the surgeon is suing the actress to get that extra $500. At trial, both sides are objecting to certain testimony. The surgeon doesn't want any testimony about the oral agreement made before the written contract was signed, and the actress doesn't want any testimony about the oral agreement made during surgery.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rules about parol evidence. Parol evidence generally refers to oral agreements that might contradict or modify a written contract. There are rules about when such evidence can be admitted.\n\nSo, the written contract is for the removal of the growth on the cheek for $1,000. The actress claims there was an oral agreement that any additional procedures would be included in that fee, but the surgeon denies this. Then, during surgery, the surgeon says they agreed orally to remove another growth on the neck for an extra $500, but the actress doesn't remember agreeing to that.\n\nNow, the surgeon is objecting to testimony about the oral agreement before the contract was signed, and the actress is objecting to testimony about the oral agreement during surgery.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nFirst, regarding the oral agreement before the contract was signed: that's likely an attempt to show that the written contract included more than just the removal of the cheek growth. If there was an oral agreement that any additional procedures would be covered by the $1,000, then the surgeon wouldn't be entitled to extra money for removing the neck growth. But the surgeon is objecting to this testimony, probably because she wants to argue that the written contract only covered the cheek growth, and any additional procedures required separate payment.\n\nOn the other hand, the actress is objecting to testimony about the oral agreement during surgery, which is the surgeon's claim that they agreed to remove the neck growth for an extra $500.\n\nSo, if both objections are sustained, meaning neither oral agreement can be admitted as evidence, then the written contract stands as is, and the surgeon only gets $1,000, which she already received, and no extra $500.\n\nBut the question says that both offerings of parol evidence are admitted and believed. So, both oral agreements are considered valid.\n\nNow, the question is whether the surgeon can collect the extra $500 under these circumstances.\n\nLet's see.\n\nFirst, there's the initial oral agreement that any additional procedures would be included in the $1,000. If that's true, then the removal of the neck growth should be covered by the $1,000, and no extra payment is due.\n\nBut the surgeon claims that during surgery, they orally agreed to remove the neck growth for an extra $500. So, there's a conflict here.\n\nIf both oral agreements are admitted and believed, we have to reconcile them.\n\nOption A says no, because the oral agreements contradict each other, and neither would be enforceable under the knock-out rule.\n\nThe knock-out rule is a principle where conflicting terms in a contract cancel each other out, and neither prevails. So, if one oral agreement says any additional procedures are included in the $1,000, and another oral agreement says that removing the neck growth costs an extra $500, these are in conflict. Therefore, neither term would be enforceable, and the written contract would stand as is\u2014$1,000 for the removal of the cheek growth, with no extra payment for the neck growth.\n\nSo, according to this, the surgeon wouldn't get the extra $500.\n\nOption B says no, because in removing the growth from the actress's neck, the surgeon performed a legal duty already owed her that was neither doubtful nor the subject of an honest dispute.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what this means. It seems to suggest that removing the neck growth was part of the surgeon's obligation under the original contract, and thus no extra payment is due. This aligns with the idea that any additional procedures were included in the $1,000.\n\nOption C says yes, because the oral modification of the prior writing was fair and equitable in view of circumstances not anticipated by the parties when the writing was executed.\n\nThis seems to suggest that the oral agreement during surgery to remove the neck growth for an extra $500 was a fair modification because it addressed a circumstance that wasn't anticipated\u2014the discovery of the neck growth during surgery.\n\nSo, according to this, the surgeon should get the extra $500.\n\nOption D says yes, because the actress would be unjustly enriched by not paying the additional $500, and injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of her oral promise.\n\nUnjust enrichment is a legal doctrine where one party would be unfairly benefited at the expense of another if the promise isn't enforced. Here, if the actress doesn't pay the extra $500 for the neck growth removal, she's getting a service she agreed to pay for, and not paying for it would be unjust.\n\nSo, according to this, the surgeon should get the extra $500.\n\nNow, I need to decide which one is correct.\n\nFirst, considering that both oral agreements are admitted and believed, we have a conflict: one says any additional procedures are included in the $1,000, and the other says removing the neck growth costs an extra $500.\n\nIf the knock-out rule applies, then neither term prevails, and the written contract stands as is\u2014$1,000 for the removal of the cheek growth, with no extra payment for the neck growth.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a way to reconcile these agreements.\n\nMaybe the initial oral agreement only covered additional procedures that were necessary or related to the cheek growth, and removing the neck growth was a separate procedure, thus requiring a separate fee.\n\nBut that's speculative. The actress claims all additional procedures are included, while the surgeon claims that removing the neck growth was a separate agreement.\n\nGiven that both oral agreements are admitted and believed, and they conflict, the knock-out rule would likely apply, meaning no extra payment is due.\n\nBut option A says \"no\" because of the knock-out rule, which aligns with this reasoning.\n\nOption B also says \"no,\" but its reasoning is a bit unclear. It mentions that the surgeon performed a legal duty already owed, which seems similar to saying that removing the neck growth was part of the original $1,000 agreement.\n\nOption C says \"yes,\" arguing that the oral modification was fair and equitable due to unforeseen circumstances.\n\nOption D says \"yes,\" based on unjust enrichment.\n\nI think the most straightforward answer is option A: no, because the oral agreements contradict each other, and under the knock-out rule, neither is enforceable.\n\nTherefore, the surgeon is not entitled to recover the additional $500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
