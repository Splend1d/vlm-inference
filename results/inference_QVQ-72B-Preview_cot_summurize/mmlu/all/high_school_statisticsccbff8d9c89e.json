                    "text": "So I have this question about t-distributions, and I need to figure out which statement isn't true. Let's see, there are four options here:\n\nA. There are different t-distributions for different values of df (degrees of freedom).\n\nB. t-distributions are bell-shaped and symmetric.\n\nC. t-distributions always have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n\nD. t-distributions are more spread out than the normal distribution.\n\nOkay, let's go through each one.\n\nStarting with A: There are different t-distributions for different values of df (degrees of freedom). I remember that the t-distribution is defined by its degrees of freedom, and as df increases, the distribution becomes less spread out and more like the standard normal distribution. So, yes, there is a different t-distribution for each value of df. This should be true.\n\nMoving on to B: t-distributions are bell-shaped and symmetric. Yeah, that sounds right. They are similar in shape to the normal distribution but have heavier tails. So, they are bell-shaped but with more spread in the tails compared to the normal distribution. Symmetry is a key property of the t-distribution. So, this seems true as well.\n\nNow, C: t-distributions always have mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Wait a minute, is that always the case? I know that the standard t-distribution has a mean of 0, but what about the standard deviation? Let me think. For a t-distribution with df degrees of freedom, the variance is df/(df-2), provided that df > 2. So, for example, with df = 1, the variance is undefined, and with df = 2, the variance is infinite. But for df > 2, the variance is df/(df-2), which is not necessarily 1. Hmm, maybe this is the incorrect statement.\n\nLet me double-check that. If df > 1, the mean exists and is 0. If df > 2, the variance exists and is df/(df-2). So, only when df approaches infinity does the variance approach 1, but for finite df, the variance is df/(df-2), which is greater than 1. So, it's not always 1. Maybe that's the one that's not true.\n\nLastly, D: t-distributions are more spread out than the normal distribution. Yeah, that makes sense. The t-distribution has heavier tails, meaning there's more spread compared to the normal distribution. As df increases, the t-distribution approaches the standard normal distribution, but for smaller df, it's more spread out.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems to be not always true because the standard deviation is df/(df-2) for df > 2, not necessarily 1.\n\nWait, but when df > 2, the variance is df/(df-2), so the standard deviation would be the square root of that, which is sqrt(df/(df-2)). That's not equal to 1 unless df is infinite. So, yes, option C is incorrect.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider df = 3. Variance is 3/(3-2) = 3/1 = 3, so standard deviation is sqrt(3) \u2248 1.732, which is not 1. For df = 4, variance is 4/2 = 2, standard deviation is sqrt(2) \u2248 1.414, still not 1. Only as df approaches infinity does the standard deviation approach 1.\n\nTherefore, option C is not true.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
