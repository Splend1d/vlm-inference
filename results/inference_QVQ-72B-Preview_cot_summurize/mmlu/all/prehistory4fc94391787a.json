                    "text": "So I have this question about Homo erectus and Homo habilis, and I need to figure out how Homo erectus differed from Homo habilis. The options are:\n\nA. Erectus fossils are found only in Africa.\n\nB. Erectus possessed a smaller brain.\n\nC. Erectus possessed a larger brain.\n\nD. Erectus was a relatively short-lived species.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to recall some basic information about Homo erectus and Homo habilis.\n\nHomo habilis is considered one of the earliest species in the genus Homo, and it lived around 2.4 to 1.4 million years ago. It's known for having a larger brain than its predecessor, Australopithecus, but smaller than that of later humans.\n\nHomo erectus appeared later, around 1.9 to 0.1 million years ago. It was taller and had a larger brain than Homo habilis, and it was the first hominin to leave Africa, spreading to parts of Eurasia.\n\nOkay, so let's look at option A: Erectus fossils are found only in Africa.\n\nFrom what I remember, Homo erectus was the first hominin to migrate out of Africa. Fossils have been found in various places outside of Africa, like in Asia and Europe. So, this can't be correct because if they left Africa, their fossils should be found in other continents too.\n\nWait, but maybe there are some fossils found only in Africa? No, I think that's not the case. Let me double-check that.\n\nUpon checking, Homo erectus fossils have indeed been found in Africa, Asia, and Europe. So, option A is incorrect.\n\nNext, option B: Erectus possessed a smaller brain.\n\nI know that Homo erectus had a larger brain compared to Homo habilis. The name \"erectus\" suggests more advanced features, including brain size. Homo erectus had a brain capacity ranging from about 800 to 1,200 cubic centimeters, whereas Homo habilis had a brain capacity ranging from about 510 to 775 cubic centimeters.\n\nSo, actually, Homo erectus had a larger brain, not smaller. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: Erectus possessed a larger brain.\n\nAs I just thought, this seems correct. Homo erectus had a larger brain than Homo habilis.\n\nBut let's make sure there aren't any exceptions or complexities here. Was there any overlap in brain sizes between the two species?\n\nFrom what I can recall, the brain size of Homo erectus was generally larger than that of Homo habilis. There might be some overlap at the higher end of Homo habilis and the lower end of Homo erectus, but overall, Homo erectus had a larger brain.\n\nAlright, so option C seems to be a correct statement.\n\nNow, option D: Erectus was a relatively short-lived species.\n\nHomo erectus existed from about 1.9 million years ago to as recently as 100,000 years ago, give or take some tens of thousands of years. That's a pretty long time, about 1.8 million years.\n\nIn comparison, Homo habilis was around for about 1 million years, from about 2.4 to 1.4 million years ago.\n\nSo, Homo erectus had a longer duration as a species, not shorter. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nWait, but the statement says \"short-lived species.\" Is there a possibility that a particular subspecies of Homo erectus was short-lived, or is that not the case?\n\nFor example, some scientists propose that Homo erectus evolved into other hominins like Homo heidelbergensis or even Neanderthals, which could complicate the timeline.\n\nHowever, generally, Homo erectus is considered a long-lived species with a wide temporal range.\n\nTherefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nSo, among the given options, the correct answer is option C: Erectus possessed a larger brain.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other differences that might be relevant.\n\nFor instance, Homo erectus was more anatomically similar to modern humans than Homo habilis, with a more robust build and longer legs, which allowed for efficient walking and running.\n\nAlso, Homo erectus is known for making more advanced tools compared to Homo habilis, who made simple stone tools.\n\nFurthermore, Homo erectus is thought to have used fire, which Homo habilis did not.\n\nBut none of these differences are listed in the options.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided options, the correct answer is option C: Erectus possessed a larger brain.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
