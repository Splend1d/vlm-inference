                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: a gas station sold 300.5849 gallons of gas in a day, and I need to round that number to the nearest hundredth. The options are A. 300, B. 300.58, C. 300.585, and D. 300.59. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I know that rounding is about simplifying numbers to make them easier to work with, and the hundredth place is the second digit after the decimal point. So, in the number 300.5849, the hundredth place is the 8, right? Because counting from the decimal: the first digit is the tenth place, the second is the hundredth, and so on.\n\nSo, to round to the nearest hundredth, I need to look at the digit in the thousandth place, which is the third digit after the decimal. In this case, that's the 4 in 300.5849.\n\nNow, the rule I remember for rounding is that if the digit right after the place you're rounding to is 5 or greater, you round up. If it's less than 5, you keep the number as is. So, since the thousandth digit is 4, which is less than 5, I should just keep the hundredth place as it is, which is 8.\n\nSo, the number should be 300.58. That would make the answer B. 300.58.\n\nWait a minute, but I see that option C is 300.585. Is there any chance that I might need to round up because of something else? Let me double-check.\n\nLooking back, the original number is 300.5849. I'm rounding to the nearest hundredth, so I'm looking at the hundredth place, which is 8, and the thousandth place is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, I don't round up, so the hundredth place remains 8. Therefore, the rounded number is 300.58.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's something about the context or additional rules for rounding that I'm missing. Let me think about it.\n\nIs there any possibility of rounding to the nearest hundredth in a way that would make it 300.59? Well, that would only happen if the thousandth place was 5 or more. But in this case, it's 4, so no, that shouldn't happen.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the ten-thousandth place. The number is 300.5849, so the ten-thousandth place is 9. But since I'm rounding to the nearest hundredth, I only need to look at the thousandth place, which is 4. So, no, the ten-thousandth place shouldn't affect my rounding here.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to think about it. Maybe I can visualize a number line. The number is between 300.58 and 300.59. Since the thousandth place is 4, which is less than 5, it's closer to 300.58 than to 300.59.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the correct answer is B. 300.58.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can try using a rounding calculator or something. If I input 300.5849 and round it to the nearest hundredth, it should give me 300.58. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here; it's a straightforward rounding problem. So, I'm confident that the answer is B. 300.58.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 300.58} \\]"
